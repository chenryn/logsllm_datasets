meaning that, on average, 97.3% of the Internet hosts were oblivious
to our attacks. See Table 7 for more details.
We found that, on average, launching a targeted attack reduces
the traffic load the adversary must handle by a factor of 25x since
the adversary must only route traffic to the victim’s prefix from 2.7%
of the Internet as opposed to 68.8% (the spread of an untargeted
BGP interception attack against this prefix from the PEERING node
at Amsterdam). In addition, targeting a BGP interception attack
reduces the overall (Internet-wide) effect on latency to the victim’s
prefix since a larger portion of Internet traffic still uses a direct
route to the victim and does not have to be additionally routed
through the adversary.
Importantly, while AS-path poisoning causes an indiscriminate
reduction in the propagation of an attack, BGP communities can
be used to strategically limit unwanted propagation beyond the
target (or targets) an attack is designed to affect. When AS-path
poisoning is used, which parts of the Internet no longer prefer the
adversary’s announcement because of the longer AS path is beyond
the control of the adversary. This is distinctly different from the
targeted attacks, where an adversary can choose which sections
of the Internet no longer prefer its route while allowing its target
source IP to still prefer its announcement.
5.7 Limitations in Evaluation
We were limited by only being able to launch attacks from the nodes
of the PEERING testbed as opposed to randomly selected ASes, and
we acknowledge that these nodes are not necessarily representative
of the Internet as a whole. However, we performed analysis of
the Internet topology to find that there are a significant number
(roughly 48%) of ASes that are in situations similar to the cases we
evaluated with the PEERING testbed, i.e., have providers with a
comparable level of community support or forward communities
to providers that do.
6 DISCUSSION: COUNTERMEASURES
6.1 Existing solutions
We analyze SICO and alternative interception techniques under
several deployed solutions to routing security.
Prefix filtering. Prefix filtering can eliminate BGP hijack and inter-
ception attacks by preventing adversaries from announcing prefixes
Session 2E: Internet SecurityCCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom442that are not allocated to them [79] (best-practices for prefix filtering
are well outlined by the Internet society’s MANRS project [20]). In
the case of a stub network, prefix filtering is theoretically effective
against all methods of achieving interception. However, non-stub
networks may still be able to launch BGP hijacks and interceptions
if they are targeting an AS that is a direct or indirect customer of
theirs. This is viable because customer prefixes are allowed through
prefix filters. In addition, many ASes still do not properly implement
prefix filtering as evident by the continual stream of new BGP
attacks [49, 60, 73] and the widespread propagation of a recent
route leak that could have been stopped by prefix filtering through
a major US carrier [70].
Route origin validation. Route origin validation involves filtering
BGP announcements by origin AS and IP prefix to only allow
announcements for an IP prefix by the legitimate prefix owner.
This is most commonly done by using RPKI to generate a list
of origin ASes allowed to announce specific prefixes and then
filtering based on this list (a.k.a. RPKI ROV) [50]. Route origin
validation does not prevent SICO or other interception techniques
because the adversary can simply prepend the legitimate prefix
owner’s ASN to its announcement which fools the route origin
check. However, it does have the beneficial aspect of making the
adversary’s announcement one hop longer thus lowering its route
ranking and reducing its route’s spread.
AS path filtering. AS path filtering (like peer locking [79]) filters
all members of an AS path to prevent an AS from accepting routes
that contain suspicious ASNs or ASN combinations in the AS path.
A simple conservative application of this involves filtering routes
coming from customers that contain the ASN of a tier-1 transit
provider, but more extensive configurations also exist [79]. AS path
filtering is highly effective against AS-path poisoning but completely
ineffective against SICO because AS-path poisoning uses AS-path
manipulation to control update propagation and may require an
adversary to put ASNs in its AS path that will ultimately lead to its
announcement being filtered. However, SICO leaves the AS path
unmodified (unless an adversary intentionally chooses to modify it
to evade route origin validation) since propagation control is instead
achieved with communities. This prevents SICO from triggering
AS path filtering.
Ultimately, a cryptographic solution like BGPsec offers the most
comprehensive resolution to the problem of BGP interception and
hijack attacks. We hope that our work serves to motivate and
accelerate the adoption of comprehensive security mechanisms
such as BGPsec.
6.2 Potential Countermeasures
We investigate four potential countermeasures: (1) restricting com-
munity propagation, (2) restricting the number of communities in
a BGP update, (3) only allowing certain community actions, and (4)
using historical BGP updates to detect abnormal communities (i.e.,
communities that are not normally seen). We find that although they
can mitigate SICO attacks, they all affect legitimate BGP community
usage to some extent. Ultimately network operators must consider a
tradeoff between allowing full community use while enabling SICO
attacks, or restricting community use (including some legitimate
usage) to mitigate the effects of SICO attacks.

Figure 9: False-positive rate vs. community size.
Restricting community propagation. Streibelt et al. recommend
in an extreme case that ASes only propagate communities to the
immediate peer the communities are targeting, i.e., community
propagation would be limited to only 2 AS hops [81]. This can
weaken an adversary’s ability to launch attacks since it cannot in-
fluence routing at an AS that is more than two hops away. However,
this proposal, similar to the countermeasure that simply disable or
reduce support for BGP communities, may limit some of the legiti-
mate uses of BGP communities for traffic engineering purposes.
We used the BGP updates collected from RouteView (i.e., the
RV dataset) (see §5.5) to inspect the number of hops a commu-
nity can propagate and investigate the impact of limiting com-
munity propagation. If we observe an update, whose AS path is
AS1, AS2, ...ASk and is associated with communities from ASk, we
assume the communities from ASk can propagate k − 1 hops. We
found communities can propagate up to 14 hops in our dataset,
and restricting the community propagation to 1 hop can cause
32.0% (i.e., false-positive rate) of updates to be dropped , which can
affect the updates from 4,217 ASes. If one restricts the community
propagation to 2, 3, 4, and 5 hops, 9.7%, 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.1% of
updates will be affected, corresponding to 4,003, 3,657, 2,943, and
1,902 ASes, respectively. AS we can see, even a small false-positive
rate (e.g., 0.1%) can affect a considerable number of ASes.
Restricting community size. One potential countermeasure is
restricting the number of communities in an announcement since in
SICO attacks an attacker may need to attach a lot of communities to
the announcements. We define the number of unique communities
being attached to an update as community size, and examine the
false-positive rates (i.e., the fractions of updates that are being
incorrectly blocked under various community size restrictions) of
this countermeasure. As shown in Figure 9, the community sizes of
legitimate BGP updates can be quite large (up to 227). In fact, in our
experiments we only need at most 5 communities for non-targeted
attacks and 16 communities for targeted attacks. The community
sizes of more than 47% (6,192 ASes) and 3% (4,399 ASes) of the
updates are longer than 5 and 16, respectively.
Restricting community action. Another potential countermea-
sure is to further limit the actions communities can perform. How-
ever, the actions that enable interception attacks are very similar
to the legitimate actions a network operator would want to have

access to for traffic-engineering purposes. Fundamentally, traffic-
engineering involves shaping BGP announcements to optimize
cost or quality of service. These same communities that allow for
this type of announcement shaping (e.g., local preference adjusting,
announcement suppression) let an adversary shape announcements
to enable interception.
Anomaly detection based on historical updates. We further
examine the efficiency of using historical BGP updates to detect
“abnormal” updates. For a given AS, we use its historical updates
to model its updates, i.e., observing the set of common community
actions and the maximum number of communities sent by the AS
in the updates, and then examine if the community actions and
community numbers in its future updates are consistent with the
built model. We used the 5,416 ASes that appear in all the three
months of updates in the RV dataset as our target ASes, and consider
three settings: using the first month (May 2019) of updates as the
historical updates to examine the remaining two months (June
2019 and July 2019) of updates, and using the first two months of
updates as the historical updates to examine the third month of
updates. An AS is a false positive if it fails the community action
check (i.e., some of its updates contain unseen community actions)
or the community number check (i.e., the number of communities
sent in some updates exceeds the maximum number seen from
the historical updates.). The results are shown in Table 8. Even
if we require that a false positive should fail BOTH checks, this
countermeasure still affects a considerable number of ASes (152 or
2.8% of the target ASes) in the best-case scenario.
As the above examples indicate, even a basic level of community
support amplifies the effectiveness of BGP attacks by enabling
interception, and this undesired effect is hard to remove without
stripping BGP communities of one of their primary uses. A possible
method to overcoming this challenge would be to couple support
for BGP action communities with AS reputation mechanisms [66].
This way, more reputable ASes could leverage the advantages of
communities while potential attackers would not be able to use
them to facilitate attacks.
7 RELATED WORK
BGP interception attacks. Ballani et al. [46] performed an in-
depth study of BGP interception but only considered announcing
to select neighbors as a way of enabling interception. Goldberg et
al. [59] consider a clever combination of AS-path poisoning and
selective neighbor announcement in the context of various BGP
security proposals (like soBGP and S-BGP [63, 84]) but still cannot
overcome the fundamental challenges of these techniques (i.e., diffi-
culty maintaining a route to the victim and limited announcement
propagation). Thus, while interception achieved with the method
presented by Goldberg et al. is “difficult for stubs” [59], SICO attacks
are highly effective even in the case of stub networks. Pilosov and
Kapela [75] looked into interception via AS-path poisoning on a
sub-prefix announcement. While this attack elegantly performs
internet-wide interception, it has several disadvantages compared
to the attacks outlined in this paper. It is more difficult to target
(the attack is inherently global since it is a sub-prefix attack), it is
more noticeable to BGP monitoring, and it is not viable against /24
prefixes (since /25s are often filtered).
Studying BGP communities. Streibelt et al. performed innova-
tive work studying attacks enabled by BGP communities and the
BGP community ecosystem [81]. They highlighted how the ability
of communities to influence route propagation at remote ASes
can be exploited by adversaries to manipulate Internet routing.
However, they did not study interception attacks or the target-
ing of attacks to different portions of the internet. Donnet et al.
present early work showing a taxonomy of BGP communities [53].
For our work we augment this taxonomy by taking a more fine-
grained look at where communities are accepted and propagated,
as well as going more in depth into the communities used for peer
export suppression.
In addition, there is a large body of recent work that high-
lights the lack of coherent design and standardization of BGP
communities. Giotsas et al. examined communities that geographi-
cally tag route origins and found that there were no standardized
values across providers [57]. In addition, even though RFC 7999
standardizes the black hole community [64], Giotsas et al. found
that several nonstandard variants still exist and some ASes do not
adhere to the proper implementation of the standard (particularly
regarding the propagation of blackholed prefixes) [58]. The severe
lack of standardization and centralized documentation for BGP
communities has caused researchers to resort to applying natural
language processing on routing policies as a means of measuring
large scale community usage [57, 58]. We considered this approach
but instead opted to manually parse routing policies from a smaller
number of ASes to eliminate potential inaccuracies and extract
more nuanced levels of community support.
Defenses against BGP attacks. The defenses outlined in §6.2
represent only a small portion of the potential countermeasures to
BGP attacks. Lad et al. introduced the early monitoring system that
detected route origin changes [68]. RPKI takes a proactive approach
to validation origins by having ASes participate in ROV to restrict
the propagation of BGP attacks [50]. However, origin authentication
is only effective to an extent given that an adversary can prepend
the required ASNs to evade defenses that only consider route
origins [56]. BGPsec offers a more comprehensive cryptographic
solution to BGP attacks [69] but currently has seen little deployment
and offers only marginal benefit at low adoption percentages [72].
Session 2E: Internet SecurityCCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom444Clean-slate approaches like the SCION architecture [85] offer alter-
natives to BGP for inter-domain routing, but once again deployment
rates are currently relatively low.
8 CONCLUSION
We present novel community-based BGP interception attacks that
can strategically target small portions of the Internet. We then
evaluate the feasibility of these attacks in the wild and measure their
effectiveness to find that our attacks are significantly more effective
then the state-of-the-art. We also successfully launched targeted
interception attacks that were isolated to only 2.7% of the Internet
on average. Through Internet topology analysis we found that, at
a minimum, 83% of multi-homed ASes are capable of launching
interception attacks via BGP communities. Overall, our work is the
first work to use BGP communities to enable interception attacks
and the first work to propose targeted interception attacks that are
aimed at specific source IP addresses.
