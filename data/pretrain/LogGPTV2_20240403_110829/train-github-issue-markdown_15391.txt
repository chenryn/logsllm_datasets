Consider this .gitignore:
    /lib/*
    !/lib/foo/
Here, we are instructing git to ignore everything under /lib, except for
things under /lib/foo. However, tree-view does not parse this correctly, and
instead matches everything under /lib, regardless of whether it's under
/lib/foo or not. Thus, if I have "Hide VCS Ignored Files" unchecked,
everything under /lib and lib/foo will be ghosted out. If I have "Hide CVS
Ignored Files" check, everything under /lib and /lib/foo will be hidden. It
appears that it's using the first rule that matches, and not the most-specific
rule that matches.
