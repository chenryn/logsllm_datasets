User: Has anyone ever heard of a UNIX shell written in a reasonable language, like Python?
Assistant: Well, there's emacs, which is arguably a shell written in lisp :)
Seriously though, are you looking for a reimplementation of an existing shell design in a different language such as Python? Or are you looking for a new implementation of a shell language that looks similar to your language of choice?
