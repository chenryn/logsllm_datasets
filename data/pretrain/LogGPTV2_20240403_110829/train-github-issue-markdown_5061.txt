I'd really like to be able to pass functions to loaders in my webpack config:
    function jsLoader(source) {
      // do whatever...
    }
    module.exports = {
      ...,
      module: {
        loaders: [
          {test: /\.js$/, loader: jsLoader}
        ]
      },
      ...
    };
The reason is that I have some global configuration state in my
webpack.config.js, example:
    var STATIC_ROOT = 'path/to/static/root';
And my js_loader needs access to that static root for the transformation that
it performs on the source code. My options are either to duplicate the
configuration in each files, which is annoying to maintain and error-prone, or
to throw all of the configuration variables into process.env, and from my
js_loader, read them back from process.env, which just feels hacky.
