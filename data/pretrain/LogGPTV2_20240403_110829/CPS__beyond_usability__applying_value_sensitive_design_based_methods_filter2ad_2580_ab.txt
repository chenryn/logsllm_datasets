potentially  use  automated 
to  detect  emergency 
situations and decrease security requirements (e.g., not require a 
password) if the patient is in a state of medical emergency [16]. 
Another, more traditional approach might be to issue temporary or 
permanent  access  passwords  via  a  centralized  entity,  such  as  a 
manufacturer-maintained database.  
Although less related to our work on implantable cardiac devices, 
there  has  been  significant  work  focused  on  security  and  privacy 
for personal medical sensors and networked medical devices (e.g., 
[29]); see [1] for a survey. Many of the efforts in this space also 
have  potential  applicability  to  implantable  medical  devices.  For 
example,  the  Amulet  system  [34]—which  requires  the  user  to 
wear  an  external  device—has  many  overlapping  elements  with 
other  defenses  for  IMDs  [8][15][1].    Additionally,  any  effort  to 
improve key establishment for body-area networks (e.g., [3][37]), 
can  be  used  to  help  improve  the  security  of  key  establishment 
systems for IMDs. 
Recently, a systematization of knowledge paper was published on 
the  topic  of  computer  security  for  implantable  medical  devices 
and  body  area  networks  (BANs)  [31].  The  paper  provides  a 
thorough  examination  of  both  attack  and  defense  work  dealing 
with  these  classes  of  technologies  in  the  computer  security 
community.  The  authors  categorize  defense  directions  as  falling 
into  four  different  trends:  Biometric  and  Physiological  Values 
(e.g., ECG or IPI), Out-of-Band (e.g., tattoos), Distance Bounding 
(e.g., intrabody signaling or cryptographic), and External Devices 
(e.g.,  fail-open  wristband).  Four  additional  categories—Wireless 
Attacks,  Software/Malware,  Anomaly  Detection,  and  Emerging 
Threats—are used to classify other research trends in the area. 
2.2  Value Sensitive Design 
Computer  security  and  access  control  systems  are  frequently 
discussed in the context of values such as security, privacy, and 
convenience. These systems, however, also affect and are affected 
by other important human values such as trust, physical welfare, 
autonomy,  or  human  dignity.    In  this  research  we  drew  on 
established theory and methods from value sensitive design (e.g., 
[12][14][24][26]) to frame our study design and our data analyses.  
First  developed  in  human-computer  interaction,,  value  sensitive 
design  has  since  been  used  in  civil  engineering,  information 
management, 
ubiquitous 
computing.    For  example,  one  security-focused  series  of  value 
sensitive design studies analyzed informed consent for cookies in 
web  browser  security  [25],  leading  to  recommendations  for 
browser redesign to better support informed consent and a proof-
of-concept redesign in the form of a plug-in “cookie watcher” for 
the  Mozilla  browser  [12].  Another  security-focused  study 
investigated  users’  mental  models  for  web  browser  security, 
suggesting  that  elements  in  the  user  interface  (e.g.,  the  open  or 
closed  padlock)  were  inadvertently  leading  some  users  to 
construct  incorrect  mental  models  for  a  secure  connection  [13]. 
More recently, value sensitive design methods have been applied 
in research about safety and security for mobile phone parenting 
technologies for teens [6], home technologies [9], and implantable 
cardiac devices from patients’ perspectives ([7], see Section 3.1). 
In  this  study,  we  drew  explicitly  on  two  value  sensitive  design 
methods: direct and indirect stakeholder analyses, and value dams 
and flows. 
human-robotic 
interaction, 
and 
Direct  and  Indirect  Stakeholder  Analyses.  In  examining  the 
ecosystem  surrounding  security  for  implantable  cardiac  devices, 
an  important  question  is  what  professional  roles  should  be 
represented among the study participants. Value sensitive design 
stresses the consideration of both: the direct stakeholders who will 
interact  with  the  technology  (e.g.,  cardiologists);  and  indirect 
stakeholders  who—while  they  do  not  directly  interact  with  the 
technology—can  affect  and  be  affected  by  the  technology  (e.g., 
venture  capitalists  who  invest  in  implantable  cardiac  devices). 
Section  3.2  provides  a  brief  explanation  as  to  why  taking  this 
broader view is valuable. 
Value Dams and Flows.  Given a wide range of possible technical 
security, it is not always obvious how to choose which system to 
pursue.  Value  dams  and  flows  is  a  technique  for  identifying 
reasonable,  value-sensitive  design  options  from  among  a  set  of 
possible  designs  or  technical  features  (e.g.,  [6][7][24]).  First, 
options that a threshold percentage of stakeholders strongly object 
to  are  removed  from  the  list  of  viable  solutions  (value  dams); 
then,  from  the  remaining  options,  those  that  many  stakeholders 
favor are selected as good candidates for solutions (value flows). 
In this research we use the value dams and flows method to help 
identify viable security designs for implantable cardiac devices. 
3.  STAKEHOLDERS, SECURITY AND 
THE MEDICAL ECOSYSTEM FOR IMDS 
3.1  Patients: Prior Work 
Previous work explored patient views and values regarding their 
implantable  cardiac  devices  in  order  to  inform  the  design  of 
security  systems  for  wireless  IMDs  [7].  The  findings  in  that 
study—as  well  as 
the  medical  provider 
viewpoint—are part of the motivation for this study. 
In  the  patient  study,  semi-structured  interviews  were  conducted 
with 13 individuals with implanted cardiac devices. Key questions 
concerned  the  evaluation  of  eight  mockups  of  early-stage  IMD 
security systems. For each system, patients provided judgments as 
to  whether  they  liked  or  disliked  the  system  and  whether  or  not 
they  would  choose  to  use  it.  Qualitatively,  patients  articulated  a 
number of values that affected their attitudes toward the systems, 
including:  security;  safety;  privacy;  aesthetics;  psychological 
welfare;  convenience;  cultural  and  historical  associations;  self-
image  and  public  persona;  and  autonomy  and  notification. 
Importantly, different patients identified different sets of cares and 
concerns  that,  in  turn,  led  to  different  levels  of  satisfaction  with 
the proposed security designs.

3.2  Medical Providers 
A patient’s medical care is an ongoing process that is affected by 
regulation,  device  manufacturers,  federal 
insurance 
companies,  hospital  equipment  purchases,  primary  care  staff, 
specialist  nurses  and  doctors,  emergency  care  staff,  operating 
room  staff,  and  others.  While  the  patient  study  described  above 
provides  some  insight  into  the  values  and  priorities  of  patients 
who  live  with  implantable  cardiac  devices  embedded  in  their 
bodies, the question of how medical providers might interact with 
these  technical  computer  security  directions  was  not  addressed. 
Yet, to be effective, security must work for and with all of the key 
stakeholders.  In  the  case  of  implantable  cardiac  devices,  this 
includes  not  only  the  patients,  but  also  the  medical  providers 
who—in  one  way  or  another—ensure  that  the  devices  function 
properly and improve patient health.  
The  current  study  with  medical  providers  builds  on  the  patient 
study  by  investigating  similar  security  system  designs  concepts. 
However, as described in the methods below, the participant pool 
and  study  format  differ  (as  appropriate  to  these  stakeholder 
groups).

4.  METHODS 
This  study  is  part  of  an  on-going,  interdisciplinary  collaboration 
among 
in  computer  security,  human-computer 
interaction,  and  cardiology.  The  researchers  have  no  special 
relationships with any particular medical device provider or other 
conflicting agency. 
4.1  Participants 
In  this  study,  we  sought  to  investigate  in  detail  the  values, 
priorities,  constraints,  and  themes  that  emerge  in  a  complex 
domain.  We  followed  an  established  approach  to  work  in  depth 
with a smaller number of participants (e.g., [22][36]) rather than 
seeking  to  answer  specific  questions  using  a  larger  number  of 
participants.  We  conducted 
three  workshops  with  medical 
providers  in  the  United  States:  one  in  a  city  on  the  west  coast 
(Group I) and two in a city on the east coast (Groups II and III). 
Participants  were  recruited  through  a  snowball  method.  The 
research team first sent emails to previous contacts in the medical 
community  requesting  suggestions  for  potential  participants  and 
relevant  mailing  lists;  the  researchers  then  followed  up  on  those 
suggestions  with  email  letters  of  invitation  to  participate  in  the 
research.  Recruitment  efforts  were  initially  extremely  slow;  this 
was  partially  because  we  needed  to  obtain  permission  from 
appropriate authorities (i.e., “gatekeepers”) and partially because 
we  needed  domain  insiders  to  explain  the  importance  of—and 
cultivate enthusiasm for—study participation (i.e., “advocates”). 
We  applied  for  and  obtained  approval  from  our  institution’s 
human  subjects  review  board.  In  order  to  synchronize  study 
protocols across the multiple institutions involved in this study, it 
was necessary to submit multiple modifications. Participants were 
compensated  $200  for  their  time;  while  this  amount  may  seem 
unusually  high,  it  was  deemed  appropriate  in  the  context  of  the 
particular participant pool (e.g., cardiologists). 
A  total  of  24  medical  providers  (age:  average=39,  min=28, 
max=64)  participated  in  the  study.  Table  1  breaks  down 
participant  gender  by  workshop.  Participants  had  a  broad 
spectrum  of  roles  in  the  medical  ecosystem:  cardiologists  and 
electrophysiologists  (n=2),  nurses  and  nurse  practitioners  in 
cardiology  and  electrophysiology  (n=5),  anesthesiologist  (n=1), 
emergency  physician  (n=1),  other  physicians  (n=2),  physician 
(n=4),  medical  device 
assistant 
manufacturer 
informatics 
researcher (n=1), and venture capitalist (n=1). 
4.2  Workshop Format 
To  elicit  participant  values,  priorities,  and  constraints  for  the 
security of implantable cardiac devices, we sought a method that 
would provide opportunities for open-ended ideation about device 
security  as  well  as  focused  reactions  to  potential  early-stage 
security concepts. We drew inspiration from and adapted Kensing 
and  Madsen's  techniques  for  “generating  visions”  [20]—which 
integrates  metaphorical  design  with  a  Future  Workshop 
(particularly  the  critique  phase)—and  Yoo  et  al.’s  Envisioning 
Workshop,  which  emphasizes  surfacing  value  tensions  among 
diverse  stakeholders  [40].  In  both  instances,  we  tailored  the 
workshop structure to focus on security aspects of specific system 
designs.  In  addition,  we  sought  both  to  collect  individual

influence  from 
reflections  and  to  benefit  from  group  discussion;  thus,  data 
collection included individual written materials as well as verbal 
group interactions. We describe the workshop protocol below. 
Each  session  lasted  a  total  of  two  hours.  Audio  recordings  were 
made of each session and then later transcribed for analysis. 
Implantable  Cardiac  Device  Overview 
Initial 
Perspectives.  To  ensure  that  all  participants  had  some  shared 
vocabulary  for  implantable  cardiac  devices,  a  research  team 
member provided a brief overview of implantable cardiac devices 
and clarified how terms would be used during the workshop. This 
overview did not include information on security for implantable 
cardiac  devices.  Following  this  overview  and  to  tap  into 
participants’  perspectives  prior 
the 
workshop  activities,  participants  were  asked  to  complete  a  brief 
paper  and  pencil  worksheet  that  elicited  their  initial  views  on 
security  and  access  control  for  implantable  cardiac  devices.  The 
worksheet contained the following questions: (1) What properties 
about implantable cardiac devices or the ecosystem surrounding 
them  do  you  value  most?;  (2)  What  things  about  implantable 
cardiac  devices  or  the  ecosystem  surrounding  them  should  not 
change?;  (3)  What  things  about  implantable  cardiac  devices  or 
the  ecosystem  surrounding  them  most  need  improvement?;  (4) 
What is the most common problem related to implantable cardiac 
devices  that  you  encounter  in  your  line  of  work  (e.g.,  lack  of 
access to patient information, inability to access cardiac device, 
device malfunction)?; and (5) What is the problem with the most 
negative  health  impact  (related  to  implantable  cardiac  devices) 
that you encounter in your line of work? 
Metaphor Generation. To help understand the broad backdrop of 
participants’  perspectives  as  well  as  potential  mental  models, 
participants  were  invited  as  a  group  to  share  verbally:  (1) 
metaphors for implantable cardiac devices; and (2) metaphors for 
security  and  access  control  for  those  devices.  A  research  team 
member facilitated the contributions and recorded each metaphor 
in a few concise words on a whiteboard.  
Critiques and Concerns. To understand how security and access 
control systems for implantable cardiac devices could go awry as 
well as to understand medical providers’ hesitations and concerns 
about this type of technology, participants were invited as a group
