title:blackhat:asia-20 Complexity Killed Security
In the past decade, we have seen an increasing number of software-based attacks on increasingly complex hardware. Many times, I have been asked: Why don't you just check the hardware documentation?The hardware documentation we would need here is usually not available to us but only to a small set of employees of the corresponding hardware manufacturer.However, even if it were available, this would not substantially change our situation. The complexity of a system built from multiple smaller sub-systems is not just the sum of the complexity of the smaller systems. The interaction between the sub-systems leads to unforeseen additional complexity.This talk discusses the ironical importance of reverse-engineering human-built and documented things, with several examples where the new perspective led to new security-critical insights.We conclude that the constant fight between increasing complexity and security will require more and more effort just to maintain security levels.
