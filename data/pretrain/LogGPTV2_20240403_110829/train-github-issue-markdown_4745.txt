#### How to reproduce the bug
While recently creating a new set of calculated columns I forgot to change the
name from the default of for all the fields. While attempting to save this, I
wound up getting an internal server error on the front end which mapped to a
"Duplicate entry '-77284' for key 'uq_table_columns_column_name'" internally.
It would be nice if that exception was caught or a specific error message
surfaced so that people knew what they did wrong.
