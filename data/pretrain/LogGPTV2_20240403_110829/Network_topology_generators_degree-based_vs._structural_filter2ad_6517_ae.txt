From these groupings we make two important observations.
(cid:15) The structural generators construct a much stricter form of
hierarchy than is present in the measured graphs. This sug-
gests a possible explanation for why they do not qualitatively
match the measured networks by our topology metrics (Sec-
tion 4).
(cid:15) PLRG qualitatively models the hierarchy present in AS and
RL graphs, even with policy routing accounted for. This re-
solves our paradox to some extent. Although not explicitly
hierarchically constructed, PLRG does capture the moderate
hierarchy in our measured networks. A question remains:
what aspect of PLRG graphs is responsible for this hierar-
chy? We address this in the next subsection.
5.2 Correlation between link usage and degree
To better understand the hierarchical structure of these graphs,
we compute the correlation between a link’s value and the lower
degree of the nodes at the end of the link. A high correlation be-
tween these two indicates that high-value links connect high degree
nodes. Figure 5 shows the correlations for the nine networks under
consideration.
The PLRG has extremely high correlation. There is absolutely
no explicit structure built into this graph. The only links that have
(relatively) high values are the ones that connect two nodes with
(relatively) high degrees. In the PLRG graph the long-tailed nature
of the power-law degree distribution means that there are numerous
nodes with very high degrees. One can think of these high-degree
nodes as “hubs” and the high value links—the backbone links—are
those that connect two hubs. In this sense, the hierarchy in a PLRG
arises entirely from the long-tailed nature of its degree distribution.
The Random graph also has a relatively high correlation. In this
graph, there is absolutely no explicit structure built in. The only
links that have (relatively) high values are the ones that connect two
nodes with (relatively) high degrees. However, the Random graph
has a very limited distribution of degrees, and so the spread of link
values is similarly limited, resulting in very limited hierarchy.

Figure 5: Correlation between minimum degree and link value
In contrast, the Tree has the lowest level of correlation. Unlike
the PLRG, the Tree’s hierarchy comes from the structure—from the
deliberate way in which the nodes are connected—and not from the
degree distribution. The correlation that is present is because the
leaves have a lower degree than the other nodes, and the associated
links have the lowest link values in the tree.
The AS and Waxman graphs have relatively high correlation,
while the Mesh, TS, Tiers, and RL have relatively low levels of
correlation. This is consistent with our reasoning above, that the
hierarchy in the structural generators (Tiers and TS) arises, like the
Tree, from the deliberate placement of links. The fact that the AS
graph has higher correlation than the RL graph, even though they
have very similar levels of hierarchy, may indicate that the hier-
archy in the RL graph is due to the deliberate placement of links
while in the AS graph the hierarchy is more related to the degrees
of the nodes (that is, to the peering relationships between the highly
connected ASs that form the “backbone” of the AS graph).
In summary, given the high correlation between link value and
degree of the attached nodes, we surmise that the hierarchy in degree-
based generators arises from their long-tailed degree distribution.
Structural generators show no such correlation, and the hierarchy
arises from explicit construction. The RL graph shows less correla-
tion, suggesting that its hierarchy is deliberately constructed, even
though its link value characteristics are quite similar to the PLRG.

We began this paper by questioning the widely accepted belief
that degree-based generators, by the very fact that they match the
degree distribution of the Internet, are superior to structural gener-
ators. We claimed that it is more important that topology genera-
tors capture the large-scale structure of the Internet than to repro-
duce the purely local properties such as the degree distribution. We
further argued that, despite the widespread acceptance of degree-
based generators, it was still an open question as to which family
of generators—structural or degree-based—would better capture
these large-scale properties. The goal of this paper was to answer
this question.
Our preliminary results suggest that:
(cid:15) Degree-based generators capture the large-scale structure of
the measured networks surprisingly well, at least according
to our metrics, and are signiﬁcantly better than structural
generators.
(cid:15) The hierarchy present in the measured networks is looser and
less strict than in the structural generators, and this is well
captured by the hierarchical structure in degree-based gener-
ators. This may explain why these generators better match
our measured topologies in terms of our metrics.
(cid:15) The hierarchy in degree-based generators arises from the long-
tailed distribution of degrees, and the backbone links are merely
the links connecting two high-degree nodes. The hierarchy
in the RL graph is not highly correlated with degree (and thus
is due to the deliberate placement of links) while there is a
higher correlation in the AS graph.
These results should not be interpreted as obviating the struc-
tural generators. The focus in this paper has been on which family
of generators best model the large-scale structure of the Internet,
which has restricted our attention to rather large graphs (the small-
est generated graph had 1000 nodes). Choosing a small (less than,
say, 100 node) topology on which to run network simulations is
an entirely separate question. As noted in [50], a power-law dis-
tribution is almost meaningless if the number of nodes is small.
With only a few nodes, it is unlikely that the degree distribution
will be able to create the implicit hierarchy necessary for modeling
networks. It may well be that the current structural generators, or
ones yet to be devised, are better choices for small-scale simulation
studies. Finally, structural generators might be more appropriate
for topology models that incorporate bandwidth, topology or geog-
raphy.
