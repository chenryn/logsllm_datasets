# geo_azimuth()
Calculates clockwise angle in radians between the line from point1 to true north and a line from point1 to point2 on Earth.
## Syntax
`geo_azimuth(`*p1_longitude*`,`*p1_latitude*`,`*p2_longitude*`,`*p2_latitude*`)`
[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]
## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
|*p1_longitude*| `real` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The longitude value in degrees of the first geospatial coordinate. A valid value is in the range [-180, +180].|
|*p1_latitude*| `real` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The latitude value in degrees of the first geospatial coordinate. A valid value is in the range [-90, +90].|
|*p2_longitude*| `real` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The longitude value in degrees of the second geospatial coordinate. A valid value is in the range [-180, +180].|
|*p2_latitude*| `real` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The latitude value in degrees of the second geospatial coordinate. A valid value is in the range [-90, +90].|
## Returns
An angle in radians between the line from point p1 to true north and line [p1, p2]. The angle is measured CW.
> [!NOTE]
>
> * The geospatial coordinates are interpreted as represented by the [WGS-84](https://earth-info.nga.mil/index.php?dir=wgs84&action=wgs84) coordinate reference system.
> * The [geodetic datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum) used to measure distance on Earth is a sphere. Line edges are [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic) on the sphere.
> * Azimuth 0 points north. Azimuth Pi/2 points east. Azimuth Pi points south. Azimuth 3Pi/2 points west.
> * If the coordinates are invalid, the query will produce a null result.
> * If point1 is equal to point2, the query will produce a null result.
> * If point1 and point2 are antipodal, the query will produce a null result.
## Examples
The following example calculates azimuth in radians.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
print azimuth_in_radians = geo_azimuth(5, 10, 10, -40)
```
**Output**
|azimuth_in_radians|
|---|
|3.05459939796449|
The following example calculates azimuth in degrees.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
let azimuth_in_radians = geo_azimuth(5, 10, 10, -40);
print azimuth_in_degrees = degrees(azimuth_in_radians);
```
**Output**
|azimuth_in_degrees|
|---|
|175.015653606568|
Consider a truck that emits telemetry of its location while it travels and we would like to know the direction.
