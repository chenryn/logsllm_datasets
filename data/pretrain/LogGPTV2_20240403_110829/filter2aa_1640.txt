#### Communication Flow Between CMS and PM
1. **CMS Opens Channel: "SYN"**
2. **PM Responds: "SYN, ACK"**
3. **CMS Confirms: "ACK"**
4. **PM Asks: "What port do you want to use?"**
5. **CMS Responds: "This one! 3627"**
6. **PM Sends: "Ok, here is some data!"**

#### Data Packets
- **Heartbeat Value (80 base 10)**
- **Heartbeat Value (120 base 10)**
- **Kali Box MAC Address**

#### Potential Consequences of Fictitious Cardiac Rhythms
- **Dr. S. Nordeck's Statement:**
  - "Fictitious cardiac rhythms, even intermittent, could lead to extended hospitalization, additional testing, and side effects from medications to control heart rhythm and/or prevent clots. The hospital could also suffer resource consumption."

#### Scenario: If the PM Monitor Was Modified
- **Fictitious Intermittent Cardiac Rhythms**
- **Check: Blood Pressure Normal?**
- **If PM Monitor Was Modified:**
  - **Fictitious Intermittent Cardiac Rhythms**
  - **Check: Blood Pressure Normal?**
  - **Medications Administered**

By following these steps and understanding the potential consequences, healthcare providers can better protect medical devices from hacking and ensure patient safety.
