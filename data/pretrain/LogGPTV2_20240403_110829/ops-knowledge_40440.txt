User: When performing server security hardening, what common security measures are there, as well as their functions and implementation steps?
Assistant: Common server security measures include but are not limited to the following: 1. Security measures at the hardware level. Such as installing server chassis locks, BIOS with passwords, anti-theft identification and other means. 2. Security measures at the operating system level. To use the latest operating system, update patches in a timely manner, disable unnecessary services, use firewalls if necessary, etc. 3. Security measures for user passwords. Complex user passwords should be set, and user passwords should not be leaked easily, and unnecessary user accounts should be disabled. 4. Security measures at the application level. Vulnerability scans are often performed, and applications and their plug-ins are updated in a timely manner. Applications with high security risks should be restricted or prohibited from being used. 5. Data backup and recovery strategy. Backup and store important data to ensure the reliability of backup data and fast recovery at any time. Implementation steps: The steps to implement server security measures should be as follows: 1. Security risk analysis. Prioritize security measures according to the degree of security risk. 2. Develop a security policy. Inform and clarify the use of security policies, such as password policies, available security services, etc., to managers and relevant users. 3. Install security software and hardware. For example: firewall, etc. 4. Safe maintenance. Update and upgrade security software and patches in a timely manner, and perform data backup, etc. 5. Monitoring and tracking. By configuring and using security tools and other means, monitor and track security events in real time, and report security events in a timely manner.
