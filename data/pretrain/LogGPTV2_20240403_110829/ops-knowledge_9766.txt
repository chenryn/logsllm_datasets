User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Running more than three commands concurrency in a cron job? We have scheduled test suite command for mutliple setups means dev and staging, prod setups in cron job with bash script.

Daily it is running one after another. we need to run all test suites with different setups with same time(parallely)

I am running that command in Cron with bash script.

setup_wise_test.sh 

setup_wise_test, In sh bash script the following commands are present. script 1
script 2
script 3 upto script 8 with different setup related test cases.

Each one is taking maximum of 45 minutes(selenium test cases). If I schedule all one after one, it's taking more than 6 hours 40 minutes to complete all.

Hence, plese help me out by suggesting the way to run all commands in bash as parallelly.


When I ran like below

21 13 * * * user cd /home/common_setupwise_testcases &amp;&amp; bash sample1.sh >> /home/cron_logs/common_setup_wise_logs/sample.log

21 13 * * * user cd /home/common_setupwise_testcases &amp;&amp; bash sample2.sh >> /home/cron_logs/common_setup_wise_logs/sample2.log

21 13 * * * user cd /home/common_setupwise_testcases &amp;&amp; bash sample3.sh >> /home/cron_logs/common_setup_wise_logs/sample3.log


in the above sample1.sh, sample2.sh sample3.sh is having run command for test cases.

When i scheduled all above 3 commands in cron(sample1.sh and sample2.sh) executed parallelly third one is not executed.

Assistant: There is your answer from unix.stackexchange:

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/287166/how-to-run-multiple-scripts-at-a-same-time

Short example, put it in 'crontab -e' of your user, who is supposed to run those jobs:

0 15 * * 6 job1
0 15 * * 6 job2
0 15 * * 6 job3


EDIT1 for @Mounika K

I've tried with very simple script:

$ cat job1.sh 
#!/bin/bash
yes &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1


And tried to run as crontab entry:

22 * * * * /var/tmp/job1.sh
22 * * * * /var/tmp/job2.sh
22 * * * * /var/tmp/job3.sh


As expected, there are 3 instances of yes program running in the background. Check if cron is allowed for users on your system.
