### Table 141: System Log Message Severity Levels (Continued)
| Value | Severity Level | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1     | Alert         | Conditions that require immediate correction, such as a corrupted system database. |
| 2     | Critical      | Critical conditions, such as hard errors. |
| 3     | Error         | Error conditions that generally have less serious consequences than those at the emergency, alert, and critical levels. |
| 4     | Warning       | Conditions that warrant monitoring. |
| 5     | Notice        | Conditions that are not errors but might warrant special handling. |
| 6     | Info          | Events or non-error conditions of interest. |
| 7     | Any           | Includes all severity levels. |

### Directing System Log Messages to a Log File
To direct system log messages to a file in the `/var/log` directory of the local Routing Engine, include the `file` statement at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
file filename {
    facility severity;
    archive size count;
    explicit-priority;
    match "regular-expression";
    structured-data {
        brief;
    }
}
```

- **Facilities and Severity Levels**: For a list of facilities and severity levels, see "Specifying the Facility and Severity of Messages to Include in the Log" on page 1310.
- **Log File Management**: To prevent log files from growing too large, the Junos OS system logging utility writes messages to a sequence of files of a defined size. By including the `archive` statement, you can configure the number of files, their maximum size, and who can read them, either for all log files or for a specific log file. For more information, see "Specifying Log File Size, Number, and Archiving Properties" on page 1274.
- **Additional Statements**:
  - `explicit-priority`: See "Including Priority Information in System Log Messages" on page 1276.
  - `match`: See "Using Strings and Regular Expressions to Refine the Set of Logged Messages" on page 1281.
  - `structured-data`: See "Logging Messages in Structured-Data Format" on page 1274.

### Directing System Log Messages to a User Terminal
To direct system log messages to the terminal session of one or more specific users (or all users) when they are logged in to the local Routing Engine, include the `user` statement at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
user (username | *) {
    facility severity;
    match "regular-expression";
}
```

- **User Specification**: Specify one or more Junos OS usernames, separating multiple values with spaces, or use the asterisk (*) to indicate all users who are logged in to the local Routing Engine.
- **Facilities and Severity Levels**: For a list of logging facilities and severity levels, see "Specifying the Facility and Severity of Messages to Include in the Log" on page 1310.
- **Match Statement**: For information about the `match` statement, see "Using Strings and Regular Expressions to Refine the Set of Logged Messages" on page 1281.

### Directing System Log Messages to the Console
To direct system log messages to the console of the local Routing Engine, include the `console` statement at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
console {
    facility severity;
}
```

- **Facilities and Severity Levels**: For a list of logging facilities and severity levels, see "Specifying the Facility and Severity of Messages to Include in the Log" on page 1310.

### Directing System Log Messages to a Remote Machine or the Other Routing Engine
To direct system log messages to a remote machine or to the other Routing Engine, include the `host` statement at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host (hostname | other-routing-engine) {
    facility severity;
    explicit-priority;
    facility-override facility;
    log-prefix string;
    match "regular-expression";
    source-address source-address;
    structured-data {
        brief;
    }
}
```

- **Remote Machine Configuration**:
  - **IP Address or Hostname**: Include the `host hostname` statement to specify the remote machine’s IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or fully qualified hostname. The remote machine must be running the standard `syslogd` utility.
  - **Source Address**: Use the `source-address` statement to specify the IP address of the device reported in the messages as their source.
  - **Facility Override**: Use the `facility-override` statement to assign an alternative facility.
  - **Log Prefix**: Use the `log-prefix` statement to add a string to each message.
  - **Structured Data**: Use the `structured-data` statement to enable the forwarding of structured system log messages to a remote system log server in the IETF system log message format.
- **Other Routing Engine Configuration**: To direct messages to the other Routing Engine on a device with two Routing Engines installed and operational, include the `host other-routing-engine` statement. This statement is not automatically reciprocal, so it must be included in each Routing Engine configuration if you want the Routing Engines to direct messages to each other.

### Specifying an Alternative Source Address for System Log Messages Directed to a Remote Destination
To specify the source router to be reported in system log messages when the messages are directed to a remote machine, include the `source-address` statement at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
source-address source-address;
```

- **Source Address**: A valid IPv4 or IPv6 address configured on one of the router interfaces. The address is reported in the messages directed to all remote machines specified in `host hostname` statements, but not in messages directed to the other Routing Engine.

### Adding a Text String to System Log Messages Directed to a Remote Destination
To add a text string to every system log message directed to a remote machine or to the other Routing Engine, include the `log-prefix` statement at the `[edit system syslog host]` hierarchy level:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog host (hostname | other-routing-engine)]
facility severity;
log-prefix string;
```

- **String Constraints**: The string can contain any alphanumeric or special character except the equal sign (`=`) and the colon (`:`). It also cannot include the space character; do not enclose the string in quotation marks.
- **Example**: The following example shows how to add the string `M120` to all messages to indicate that the router is an M120 router, and direct the messages to the remote machine `hardware-logger.mycompany.com`:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host hardware-logger.mycompany.com {
    any info;
    log-prefix M120;
}
```

- **Sample Output**:
  ```plaintext
  Mar 9 17:33:23 origin1 M120: mgd[477]: UI_CMDLINE_READ_LINE: user ‘root’, command ‘run show version’
  ```

### Changing the Alternative Facility Name for System Log Messages Directed to a Remote Destination
Some facilities assigned to messages logged on the local router or switch have Junos OS-specific names. In the recommended configuration, a remote machine designated at the `[edit system syslog host hostname]` hierarchy level is not a Juniper Networks router or switch, so its `syslogd` utility cannot interpret the Junos OS-specific names. To enable the standard `syslogd` utility to handle messages from these facilities, a standard localX facility name is used instead of the Junos OS-specific facility name.

- **Default Facilities**: "Default Facilities for System Log Messages Directed to a Remote Destination" on page 1320 lists the default alternative facility name next to the Junos OS-specific facility name it is used for.
- **Example Configuration**:
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  host monitor.mycompany.com {
      authorization info;
  }
  ```
- **Alternative Facility**: To change the facility used for all messages directed to a remote machine, include the `facility-override` statement at the `[edit system syslog host hostname]` hierarchy level:
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog host hostname]
  facility severity;
  facility-override facility;
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  host monitor.mycompany.com {
      any error;
      facility-override local0;
  }
  ```

### Examples: Assigning an Alternative Facility to System Log Messages Directed to a Remote Destination
- **Log All Messages at Error Level or Higher**:
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  host monitor.mycompany.com {
      any error;
      facility-override local0;
  }
  ```
- **Configure Routers in Different Locations**:
  - **California Routers**:
    ```plaintext
    [edit system syslog]
    host central-logger.mycompany.com {
        change-log info;
        facility-override local0;
    }
    ```
  - **New York Routers**:
    ```plaintext
    [edit system syslog]
    host central-logger.mycompany.com {
        change-log info;
        facility-override local2;
    }
    ```
- **Central Logger Configuration**: On `central-logger`, configure the system logging utility to write messages from the `local0` facility to the file `california-config` and the messages from the `local2` facility to the file `new-york-config`.

### Directing Messages to a Remote Destination from the Routing Matrix Based on the TX Matrix Router
You can configure a routing matrix composed of a TX Matrix router and T640 routers to direct system logging messages to a remote machine or the other Routing Engine on each router, just as on a single-chassis system. Include the `host` statement at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level on the TX Matrix router:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host (hostname | other-routing-engine) {
    facility severity;
    explicit-priority;
    facility-override facility;
    log-prefix string;
    match "regular-expression";
    source-address source-address;
}
```

- **TX Matrix Router Configuration**: The TX Matrix router directs messages to a remote machine or the other Routing Engine in the same way as a single-chassis system. The optional statements (`explicit-priority`, `facility-override`, `log-prefix`, `match`, and `source-address`) have the same effect as on a single-chassis system.
- **Priority Information**: For the TX Matrix router to include priority information when it directs messages that originated on a T640 router to the remote destination, include the `explicit-priority` statement at the `[edit system syslog host scc-master]` hierarchy level.
- **Routing Engine Interaction**: The `other-routing-engine` statement does not interact with message forwarding from the T640 routers to the TX Matrix router. For example, if you include the statement in the configuration for the Routing Engine in slot 0 (re0), the re0 Routing Engine on each T640 router sends messages to the re1 Routing Engine on its platform only. It does not also send messages directly to the re1 Routing Engine on the TX Matrix router.
- **Consequences**:
  - **Duplicate Messages**: If the T640 routers are configured to forward messages to the TX Matrix router (as in the default configuration), the remote machine receives two copies of some messages: one directly from the T640 router and the other from the TX Matrix router.
  - **Source Address**: If the `source-address` statement is configured at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level, all routers in the routing matrix report the same source address in messages directed to the remote machine.
  - **Log Prefix**: If the `log-prefix` statement is included, the messages from all routers in the routing matrix include the same text string. You cannot use the string to distinguish between the routers in the routing matrix.

### Directing Messages to a Remote Destination from the Routing Matrix Based on a TX Matrix Plus Router
From the perspective of the user interface, the routing matrix appears as a single router. The TX Matrix Plus router (also called the switch-fabric chassis SFC) controls all the T1600 or T4000 routers (also called the line-card chassis LCC) in the routing matrix.

- **Configuration**:
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  host (hostname | other-routing-engine) {
      facility severity;
      explicit-priority;
      facility-override facility;
      log-prefix string;
      match "regular-expression";
      source-address source-address;
  }
  ```
- **TX Matrix Plus Router Configuration**: The TX Matrix Plus router directs messages to a remote machine or the other Routing Engine in the same way as a single-chassis system. The optional statements (`explicit-priority`, `facility-override`, `log-prefix`, `match`, and `source-address`) have the same effect as on a single-chassis system.
- **Priority Information**: For the TX Matrix Plus router to include priority information when it directs messages that originated on a connected T1600 or T4000 LCC to the remote destination, include the `explicit-priority` statement at the `[edit system syslog host sfc0-master]` hierarchy level.
- **Routing Engine Interaction**: The `other-routing-engine` statement does not interact with message forwarding from the connected T1600 or T4000 LCCs to the SFC. For example, if you include the statement in the configuration for the Routing Engine in slot 0 (re0), the re0 Routing Engine on each connected T1600 or T4000 LCC sends messages to the re1 Routing Engine on its router only. It does not also send messages directly to the re1 Routing Engine on the SFC.
- **Consequences**:
  - **Duplicate Messages**: If the LCCs are configured to forward messages to the SFC (as in the default configuration), the remote machine receives two copies of some messages: one directly from the T1600 or T4000 LCC and the other from the SFC.
  - **Source Address**: If the `source-address` statement is configured at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level, all routers in the routing matrix report the same source address in messages directed to the remote machine.
  - **Log Prefix**: If the `log-prefix` statement is included, the messages from all routers in the routing matrix include the same text string. You cannot use the string to distinguish between the routers in the routing matrix.

### Displaying System Log Files
#### Display a Log File from a Single-Chassis System
To display a log file stored on a single-chassis system, enter Junos OS CLI operational mode and issue either of the following commands:

```plaintext
user@host> show log log-filename
user@host> file show log-file-pathname
```

- **Routing Engine Specification**: By default, the commands display the file stored on the local Routing Engine. To display the file stored on a particular Routing Engine, prefix the file or pathname with the string `re0` or `re1` and a colon.
