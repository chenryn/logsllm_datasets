ABSTRACT
Recently, there has been much excitement in the research
community over using social networks to mitigate multiple
identity, or Sybil, attacks. A number of schemes have been
proposed, but they diﬀer greatly in the algorithms they use
and in the networks upon which they are evaluated. As a
result, the research community lacks a clear understanding
of how these schemes compare against each other, how well
they would work on real-world social networks with diﬀerent
structural properties, or whether there exist other (poten-
tially better) ways of Sybil defense.
In this paper, we show that, despite their considerable dif-
ferences, existing Sybil defense schemes work by detecting
local communities (i.e., clusters of nodes more tightly knit
than the rest of the graph) around a trusted node. Our
ﬁnding has important implications for both existing and fu-
ture designs of Sybil defense schemes. First, we show that
there is an opportunity to leverage the substantial amount
of prior work on general community detection algorithms in
order to defend against Sybils. Second, our analysis reveals
the fundamental limits of current social network-based Sybil
defenses: We demonstrate that networks with well-deﬁned
community structure are inherently more vulnerable to Sybil
attacks, and that, in such networks, Sybils can carefully tar-
get their links in order make their attacks more eﬀective.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Avoiding multiple identity, or Sybil, attacks is known to
be a fundamental problem in the design of distributed sys-
tems [8]. Malicious attackers can create multiple identities
and inﬂuence the working of systems that rely upon open
membership. Examples of such systems range from commu-
nication systems like email and instant messaging to collabo-
rative content rating, recommendation, and delivery systems
such as Digg and BitTorrent. Traditional defenses against
Sybil attacks rely on trusted identities provided by a cer-
tiﬁcation authority. But requiring users to present trusted
identities runs counter to the open membership that under-
lies the success of these distributed systems in the ﬁrst place.
Recently, there has been excitement in the research com-
munity about applying social networks to mitigate Sybil at-
tacks. A number of schemes have been proposed that at-
tempt to defend against Sybils in a social network by us-
ing properties of the social network’s structure [7, 29, 32, 33].
Unlike traditional solutions, these schemes require no cen-
tral trusted identities, and instead rely on the trust that is
embodied in existing social relationships between users.
All social network-based Sybil defense schemes make the
assumption that, although an attacker can create arbitrary
Sybil identities in social networks, he or she cannot establish
an arbitrarily large number of social connections to non-
Sybil nodes. As a result, Sybil nodes tend to be poorly
connected to the rest of the network, compared to the non-
Sybil nodes. Sybil defense schemes leverage this observation
to identify Sybils. They use various graph analysis tech-
niques to search for topological features resulting from the
limited capacity of Sybils to establish social links.
Our focus in this paper is on the graph analysis algorithms
behind the schemes. The literature on Sybil defense schemes
is still in its early stages; most papers describe new algo-
rithms, but none provide a common insight that explains
how all of these schemes are able to detect Sybils. Each
algorithm has been shown to work well under its own as-
sumptions about the structure of the social network and the
links connecting non-Sybil and Sybil nodes. However, it is
unclear how these algorithms would compare against each
other, on more general topologies, or under diﬀerent attack
strategies. As a result, it is not known if there exist other
(potentially better) ways to mitigate Sybil attacks or if there
are fundamental limits to using only the structure of the so-
cial network to defend against Sybils.
In this paper, we take a ﬁrst, but important, step towards
answering these questions. We decompose existing Sybil de-
fense schemes and demonstrate that at their core, the var-
363ious algorithms work by implicitly ranking nodes based on
how well the nodes are connected to a trusted node. Nodes
that have better connectivity to the trusted node are ranked
higher and are deemed to be more trustworthy. We show
that, despite their considerable diﬀerences, all Sybil defense
schemes rank nodes similarly—nodes within local communi-
ties (i.e., clusters of nodes more tightly knit than the rest
of the network) around the trusted node are ranked higher
than nodes in the rest of the network. Thus, Sybil defense
schemes work by eﬀectively detecting local communities.
The above insight has important implications for both ex-
isting and future designs of social network-based Sybil de-
fense schemes. First, it motivates us to investigate whether
a class of algorithms, known as community detection algo-
rithms [10], that attempt to ﬁnd such clusters of nodes di-
rectly, could be used for Sybil defense. We ﬁnd that it is
possible to use oﬀ-the-shelf community detection algorithms
to ﬁnd Sybils. Unlike Sybil defense, community detection is
a well-studied and mature ﬁeld, implying that our ﬁndings
open the door for researchers to exploit a variety of tech-
niques from a rich body of community detection literature.
Second, our insight also hints at the limitations of relying
on communities for ﬁnding Sybils. For Sybil defense schemes
to work well, all non-Sybil nodes need to form a single
community that is distinguishable from the group of Sybil
nodes.1 In reality, however, users in many social networks
form multiple communities that are interconnected rather
sparsely. We show that, in these networks, it is hard for a
trusted node to distinguish Sybils from non-Sybils outside
its local community. Further, we demonstrate how Sybils
can launch extremely eﬀective attacks by establishing just
a small number of links to carefully targeted nodes within
such networks. As systems are beginning to be built on top
of Sybil defense schemes [17, 18, 27], our ﬁndings question
the wisdom of building these systems without a thorough
understanding of the limitations of Sybil defense.
2. UNDERSTANDING SYBIL DEFENSE
As noted before, a variety of Sybil defense schemes have been
proposed, but each has been evaluated using diﬀerent social
networks and attack strategies by the Sybils. Therefore, it
is not well understood how these diﬀerent schemes compare
against each other, or how a potential user of these schemes,
such as a real-world social networking site, would select one
scheme over another.
2.1 The core of Sybil defense schemes
Given the problem of comparing competing Sybil defense
schemes, one approach would be to view the schemes as
complete coherent proposals (i.e., treat them as black boxes,
and compare them in real-world settings). Such an approach
is straight-forward and would provide useful performance
comparisons between a ﬁxed conﬁguration of schemes over
a given set of social networks and attack strategies by the
Sybils. However, it would not yield conclusive information
on how a particular scheme would perform if either the given
social network or the behavior of the attacker should change.
It also does not allow us to derive any fundamental insights
1Many Sybil defense schemes impose this requirement im-
plicitly by assuming that the non-Sybil region of the net-
work is fast mixing [22], meaning a random walk of length
O(log N ) reaches a stationary distribution of nodes.
into how these schemes work, which might enable us to build
upon and improve them.
An alternative approach is to ﬁnd a core insight common
to all the schemes that would explain their performance in
any setting. Gaining such a fundamental insight, while dif-
ﬁcult, not only provides guidance on improving future de-
signs, but also sheds light on the limits of social network-
based Sybil defense. However, we cannot gain such an in-
sight by treating each of these schemes as a black box, with
each carrying its own set of algorithms, optimizations, and
assumptions.
Instead, we need to reduce the schemes to
their core task before analyzing them.
At a high level, all existing schemes attempt to isolate
Sybils embedded within a social network topology. Every
scheme declares nodes in the network as either Sybils or
non-Sybils from the perspective of a trusted node, eﬀectively
partitioning the nodes in the social network into two distinct
regions (non-Sybils and Sybils). Hence, each Sybil defense
scheme can actually be viewed as a graph partitioning algo-
rithm, where the graph is the social network. However, the
quality and performance of the algorithm depends on the
inputs, namely, the network topology and the trusted node.
Most Sybil defense schemes include a number of use-
ful and practical optimizations that enhance their perfor-
mance in speciﬁc application scenarios. For example, Sybil-
Guard [33] and SybilLimit [32] have a number of design
features that facilitate their use in decentralized systems.
Similarly, SumUp [29] has optimizations speciﬁc to online
content voting systems. However, because our goal is to un-
cover the core graph partitioning algorithm, we study these
schemes independent of the assumptions about their appli-
cation environments as well as the optimizations that are
speciﬁc to those environments. Later in the paper, we show
that this approach not only oﬀers hints for the designers of
future Sybil defense schemes, but also helps us understand
the characteristics of real-world social networks that make
them vulnerable to Sybil attacks.
2.2 Converting partitions to rankings
Even when viewing the schemes as graph partitioning al-
gorithms, comparing the diﬀerent Sybil defense schemes is
not entirely straightforward. The output of each scheme de-
pends on the setting of numerous parameters. At a high
level, these parameters can be seen as making the partition-
ing between Sybils and non-Sybils either more restrictive or
permissive, thereby trading false positives for false negatives.
While the designers of the schemes oﬀer rough guidelines

ranking of nodes. Diﬀerent parameter settings (α, β,

as Sybils, thereby inducing a ranking.

for choosing the parameter values (e.g., set a parameter to
O(log N ) where N is the number of network nodes), there
can be considerable variation in the output from diﬀerent
parameter settings that follow the guidelines. Given the dif-
ﬁculty in selecting the right parameter settings, we would
like to compare the schemes independent of the choice of
their respective parameters.
We studied the impact of changing parameters on the out-
put of the Sybil and non-Sybil partitions. We observed that
as the Sybil partition grows or shrinks in response to pa-
rameter changes, an ordering can be imposed on the nodes
added or removed.2 That is, when the Sybil partition grows
larger, new nodes are added to the partition without remov-
ing nodes previously classiﬁed as Sybils. Similarly, when the
Sybil partition grows smaller, some nodes are removed from
the partition without adding any nodes previously classiﬁed
as non-Sybils. Figure 1 illustrates how diﬀerent partition-
ings obtained by changing parameters can be converted into
an ordering or ranking of nodes.
Our observation suggests that one can view the Sybil de-
fense schemes as implicitly ordering or ranking nodes in the
network, while the parameter settings determine where the
boundary between the partitions, called the cutoﬀ point,
lies. Changing the parameters slides the cutoﬀ point along
the ranking, but the resulting partitions uphold the ob-
served ranking of nodes. Thus, we can compare the dif-
ferent schemes independently of their parameters by simply
comparing their relative rankings of the nodes.
2.3 Reduction of existing schemes
We reduce each Sybil defense scheme into its component
processes using the model presented in Figure 2. At its core,
each scheme contains an algorithm, which, given a trusted
node and a network, produces a ranking of the nodes in the
network relative to the trusted node. Then, depending on
the setting of various parameter values, the scheme creates
a cutoﬀ, which is applied to the ranking and produces a
Sybil/non-Sybil partitioning.
The schemes that we examine in this paper are Sybil-
Guard [33], SybilLimit [32], SybilInfer [7], and SumUp [29].
For each of these Sybil defense schemes, Table 1 identiﬁes
2While we do not formally prove that all parameters of any
Sybil defense scheme must induce an ordering, it is the case
for all schemes, environments, and parameters we analyzed.
the partitioning algorithm, how this partitioning induces a
ranking of nodes, and how the algorithm parameters deter-
mine a cutoﬀ. We also describe the assumptions the schemes
make about their input environment (i.e., the structure of
non-Sybil and Sybil topologies), and brieﬂy describe the net-
works that these schemes were evaluated upon. A more de-
tailed description of how these schemes map into our model
is included in the Appendices.
Although we only show how our model applies to four
well-known schemes, we believe that it could be applied to
other schemes as well. For example, a recent work pro-
poses a Sybil-resilient distributed hash table routing pro-
tocol [17, 18], by using social connections between users to
build routing tables. The protocol relies on random walks
much in the same manner as SybilGuard and SybilLimit, so
we believe our analysis would apply to it as well. Similarly,
Quercia et al. [27] recently proposed a Sybil defense scheme
that relies on a graph-theoretic metric called betweenness
centrality to calculate the likelihood of a node being a Sybil.
To apply our analysis, the centrality measure can be used
directly to induce a ranking of the nodes.
