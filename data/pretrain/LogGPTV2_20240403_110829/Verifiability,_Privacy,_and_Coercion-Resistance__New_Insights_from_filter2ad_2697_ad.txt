can simply subtract these votes from the ﬁnal result and obtain
what we call the pure result (cid:3)r = (r0, . . . ,rk) of the election,
where ri, i ∈ {1, . . . ,k}, is the number of votes for candidate i
casted by honest voters, and r0 is the number of honest voters
who abstained from voting. Note that r0 + ··· + rk = n + 1
(n honest voters plus the observed voter). We denote by Res
the set of all pure results. Let Ai
(cid:3)r denote the probability that
the choices made by the honest voters yield the pure result
(cid:3)r, given that the voter under observation votes for the i-th
candidate. (Clearly, Ai

in the notation.) Moreover, let M
Now, the intuition behind the deﬁnition of δPriv(k,n,(cid:3)p) is as
follows: If the observer, given a pure result (cid:3)r, wants to decide

The following theorem states that δPriv(k,n,(cid:3)p) is indeed
the optimal level of privacy, where VA denotes the trusted
authority in the ideal voting protocol.
Theorem 2. Let S = Pideal({VA},q,n,k,(cid:3)p) be an instantiation
of the ideal protocol and δ = δPriv(n,k,(cid:3)p). Then S achieves
δ -privacy. Moreover, S does not achieve δ(cid:2)
-privacy for any
δ(cid:2) < δ .
Due to space limitations, we omit the proof in this extended
abstract. Some values for δPriv(n,k,(cid:3)p) are depicted in Figure 3
(see the values for the ideal protocol).
B. Deﬁnition of Coercion-Resistance
We now brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of coercion-resistance
from [18]. Since the overall setting for coercion-resistance
is similar to that of privacy, we highlight the differences to
privacy.
For the deﬁnition of coercion-resistance, the voter under
observation considered for privacy is now replaced by a voter
under coercion, also called a coerced voter. Unlike a voter
under observation, a coerced voter does not have to follow the
honest voting procedure but can deviate from it. We denote
by V the set of all programs the coerced voter v can run. This
set includes all probabilistic polynomial-time ITMs where the
communication interface is that of an honest voter plus an
input and output channel for communication with the coercer
(see below). In particular, the set V contains what we call a
dummy strategy dum which simply forwards all the messages
between the coercer and the interface the coerced voter has as
an honest voter.
The observer in the case of privacy is now replaced by the
coercer. We denote by C the set of all programs a coercer
can run, i.e., all probabilistic polynomial-time ITMs with a
communication interface similar to that of observers, where in
addition the coercer can communicate with the coerced voter.
Before recalling the formal deﬁnition of coercion-resistance,
we provide some intuition. We imagine that
the coercer
demands full control over the voting interface of the coerced
voter, i.e., the coercer wants the coerced voter to run the
dummy strategy dum ∈ V instead of the program an honest
voter would run. If the coerced voter in fact runs dum, the
coercer can effectively vote on behalf of the coerced voter or
decide to abstain from voting. Of course, the coercer is not
bound to follow the speciﬁed voting procedure.
Now, informally speaking, a protocol is called coercion-
resistant if the coerced voter, instead of running the dummy
strategy, can run some counter-strategy ˜v ∈ V such that (i)
by running this counter-strategy, the coerced voter achieves
her own goal, e.g., votes for a speciﬁc candidate (see below),
545
and (ii) the coercer is not able to distinguish whether the
coerced voter followed his instructions (i.e., ran dum) or tried
to achieve her own goal (by running ˜v). If such a counter-
strategy exists, then it indeed does not make sense for the
coercer to try to inﬂuence a voter in any way, e.g., by offering
money and/or threatening the voter: Even if the coerced voter
tries to sell her vote by running dum, i.e., by following the
coercer’s instructions, the coercer is not able to tell whether the
coerced voter is actually following the coercer’s instructions
or whether she is just trying to achieve her own goal. For
the same reason, the coerced voter can safely run the counter-
strategy and achieve her own goal, even if she is coerced into
running dum.
The goal of the coerced voter is formalized by a set γ of
runs. For example, if γ is supposed to express that the coerced
voter wants to vote for a certain candidate, then γ would
contain all runs in which the coerced voter (successfully) voted
for this candidate.
In the formal deﬁnition of coercion-resistance, we write,
analogously to the case of privacy, Pr[(πc (cid:5) πv (cid:5) e)((cid:2)) (cid:9)→ 1]
for the probability that πc outputs 1 in a run of the process
(πc (cid:5) πv (cid:5) e) with security parameter 1(cid:2). We write Pr[(πc (cid:5)
πv (cid:5) e)((cid:2)) (cid:9)→ γ] for the probability that a run of (πc (cid:5) πv (cid:5) e),
with security parameter 1(cid:2), belongs to γ.

increases her chances of being harmed. This might be a strong
incentive for the coerced voter to follow the instructions of the
coercer.
While here we concentrated on the case for one coerced
voter, the above deﬁnition in fact also applies to the setting of
multiple coerced voters (see [18]).
Coercion-resistance of the Ideal Protocol. Since we will refer
to the level of coercion-resistance of the ideal protocol in this
paper, we recall the optimal level of coercion-resistance estab-
lished in [18]. Similarly to the case of privacy, let Ai
(cid:3)r denote
the probability that the choices made by the honest voters and
the coerced voter yield the pure result (cid:3)r = (r0, . . . ,rk), given
that the coerced voter votes for the i-th candidate. Also, let

Let γi be the goal of the coerced voter which is achieved
if the coerced voter votes for candidate i, in case she is
instructed by the coercer to vote (for some candidate). Note
that coercion-resistance w.r.t. this goal does not imply that
forced abstention attacks are prevented: If the coercer wants
the coerced voter to abstain from voting, the coerced voter,
when running her counter-strategy, does not need to vote in
order to fulﬁl the goal. While for the ideal protocol a stronger
goal which says that the coerced voter in any case votes for
i could be considered, for ThreeBallot and VAV such a goal,
which requires that forced abstention attacks are not possible,
is too strong (see Section VI-D). The following theorem states
that δ i
Theorem 3 ([18]). Let S = Pideal({VA},q,n,k,(cid:3)p). Then, S is δ -
coercion-resistant w.r.t. γi, where δ = δ i

(n,k,(cid:3)p) is optimal for γi:

Similar to the case of privacy, in Condition (ii) the difference
is required to be δ -bounded instead of negligible, since there
is always a non-negligible chance for the coercer to know
for sure whether the coerced voter followed his instructions
or not. For example, if one candidate got all votes, but the
coercer told the coerced voter to vote for a different candidate,
then the coercer knows that the coerced voter did not follow
his instructions. In general, as in the case of privacy, δ is
a function of (cid:3)p, k, and the number n = |VH| of honest voters
(see below and Section VI-D). Clearly, a small δ is preferable.
Let us illustrate the meaning of δ by the following example.
Assume that if πc outputs 1, i.e., the coercer thinks that the
coerced voter is following his instructions, then the coercer
pays $100 to the coerced voter, and otherwise, if πc outputs
0, i.e., the coercer thinks that the coerced voter did not follow
his instructions, he might harm the coerced voter. Now, if
δ = 0.8, then this means that if the coerced voter follows
the instructions of the coercer, the coerced voter increases her
chances of getting payed (not being harmed) by up to 80%.
Conversely, by following the counter-strategy,
the coerced
voter drastically decreases her chances of getting payed and
We note that the level of privacy of the ideal protocol
coincides with the level of coercion-resistance of the ideal
protocol, if the goal of the coerced voter is to vote for the
candidate with the smallest probability according to (cid:3)p.
C. Privacy of ThreeBallot and VAV
In this section, we analyze the level of privacy provided by
all variants of ThreeBallot and VAV described in Sections III
and IV. In all cases, the presentation of the results follows
the same structure: First, we deﬁne what we call an essential
view of the observer, where we abstract away from some parts
of the observer’s full view in a given protocol run. Based on
the notion of an essential view, we deﬁne the optimal level of
privacy, δ , and state the result. Due to the similar structure, we
introduce the necessary terminology and present the results “in
parallel” for all protocol variants. We start with our modeling
and security assumptions, which are largely the same for all
variants.
Modeling and Security Assumptions.
In our analysis, we
assume that the observer can see whether a voter enters the
voting booth. We also assume that an honest voter may reveal
546
By Ps+
VAV and Ps−
her (paper) receipt to the observer, after the voting phase
is ﬁnished. However, to measure how much information an
observer gains from the receipts of honest voters, we will also
consider the case that the observer does not get to see the
receipts of honest voters.
Moreover, we assume that the voting machine (the scanner)
is honest; the bulletin board may be dishonest. Note that
this assumption is indeed necessary for privacy: without this
assumption, the observer gets to know how voters vote, as the
voters disclose their votes to the machine. Even though the
machine, at the moment a voter votes, might not know who
the voter is, this information could be reconstructed from the
order in which voters voted.
is well-known that without

two candidates, i.e., a case where the so-called short ballot
assumption is fulﬁlled. It
this
assumption, ThreeBallot does not have a sufﬁcient level of
privacy and coercion-resistance (see, e.g., [26], [11]). The
degradation of the level of coercion-resistance of the variant
of ThreeBallot by Marneffe et al. in the multi-candidate case
was formally studied in [18]. However, in our analysis of VAV
we do not restrict the number of candidates.
VAV we denote the simple variant of the VAV
protocol (modeled as a protocol in the sense of Section II),
where ‘+’ and ‘−’ indicate whether or not the honest voters
reveal their receipts. Similarly, Pp+
VAV denote the
privacy enhanced variant of VAV, with/without receipts being
revealed. As for ThreeBallot, we use Po+
TB for the
original variant and Pp+
TB for the variant by Marneffe
et al.

instead of Ps+
VAV(AH ,q,n,k,(cid:3)p).
We denote the set of all the instantiations described above

Views and essential views. The view of the observer in
a protocol run contains (1) the random coins generated by
the observer, (2) optionally, depending on the case under
consideration, the receipts of the honest voters, after the voting
phase is ﬁnished, and (3) all messages received from the
interface of the dishonest parties (which the observer controls).
The latter includes all dishonest voters and the bulletin board,
containing the shufﬂed simple ballots with serial numbers.
Note that the observer cannot directly see the information the
honest voters obtain or the actions they perform in the voting
booth.
In an essential view of the observer we abstract away
from those parts of his view which are not relevant for
distinguishing how voters vote, e.g., the serial numbers on the
547
simple ballots, the order of the simple ballots on the bulletin
board or the simple ballots of the dishonest voters (which are
determined by the observer). The crucial part of the proof of
Theorem 4, stated below, is to show that, indeed, the observer
can without loss of generality base his decision solely on such
essential views.
More precisely, if the observer cannot see the receipts of
the voters, the essential view is deﬁned to be the pure result
of the election, as deﬁned in Section VI-A. If the observer can
see the receipts, the deﬁnition of an essential view depends on
the system under consideration:
– ThreeBallot: The essential view of the observer consists of
(i) three integers nx
x indicating the number of the
respective simple ballots on the bulletin board cast by honest
voters, including the observed voter, and (ii) the receipt r
o, and
of the voter under observation and (iii) integers rx
x , indicating the number of the respective receipts taken by

the honest voters.
Note that from these numbers the number of o
