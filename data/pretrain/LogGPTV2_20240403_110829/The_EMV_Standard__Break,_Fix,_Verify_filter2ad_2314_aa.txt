Abstract—EMV is the international protocol standard for
smartcard payment and is used in over 9 billion cards worldwide.
Despite the standard’s advertised security, various issues have
been previously uncovered, deriving from logical ﬂaws that are
hard to spot in EMV’s lengthy and complex speciﬁcation, running
over 2,000 pages.
We formalize a comprehensive symbolic model of EMV in
Tamarin, a state-of-the-art protocol veriﬁer. Our model is the
ﬁrst that supports a ﬁne-grained analysis of all relevant security
guarantees that EMV is intended to offer. We use our model to
automatically identify ﬂaws that lead to two critical attacks: one
that defrauds the cardholder and a second that defrauds the mer-
chant. First, criminals can use a victim’s Visa contactless card to
make payments for amounts that require cardholder veriﬁcation,
without knowledge of the card’s PIN. We built a proof-of-concept
Android application and successfully demonstrated this attack
on real-world payment terminals. Second, criminals can trick
the terminal into accepting an unauthentic ofﬂine transaction,
which the issuing bank should later decline, after the criminal
has walked away with the goods. This attack is possible for
implementations following the standard, although we did not test
it on actual terminals for ethical reasons. Finally, we propose
and verify improvements to the standard that prevent these
attacks, as well as any other attacks that violate the considered
security properties. The proposed improvements can be easily
implemented in the terminals and do not affect the cards in
circulation.

I. INTRODUCTION
EMV, named after its founders Europay, Mastercard, and
Visa, is the worldwide standard for smartcard payment, devel-
oped in the mid 1990s. As of December 2019, more than 80%
of all card-present transactions globally use EMV, reaching
up to 98% in many European countries. Banks have a strong
incentive to adopt EMV due to the liability shift, which relieves
banks using the standard from any liability from payment
disputes. If the disputed transaction was authorized by a PIN
then the consumer (EMV terminology for the payment-card
customer) is held liable. If a paper signature was used instead,
then the merchant is charged.
EMV: 20 Years of Vulnerabilities
Besides the liability shift, EMV’s global acceptance is
also attributed to its advertised security. However, EMV’s
security has been challenged numerous times. Man-in-the-
middle (MITM) attacks [1], card cloning [2], [3], downgrade
attacks [3], relay attacks [4]–[8], and card skimming [9],
[10] are all examples of successful exploits of the standard’s
shortcomings. The MITM attack reported by Murdoch et
al. [1] is believed to have been used by criminals in 2010–11
in France and Belgium to carry out fraudulent transactions for
ca. 600,000 Euros [11]. The underlying ﬂaw of Murdoch et
al.’s attack is that the card’s response to the terminal’s ofﬂine
PIN veriﬁcation request is not authenticated.
Some of the security issues identiﬁed result from ﬂawed
implementations of the standard. Others stem from logical
ﬂaws whose repairs would require changes to the entire EMV
infrastructure. Identifying such ﬂaws is far from trivial due
to the complexity of EMV’s execution ﬂow, which is highly
ﬂexible in terms of card authentication modes, cardholder
veriﬁcation methods, and online/ofﬂine authorizations. This
raises the question of how we can systematically explore all
possible executions and improve the standard to avoid another
twenty years of attacks.
Approach Taken: Break, Fix, Verify
In this paper we focus on weakness of and improvements to
the EMV protocol design. We present a formal, comprehensive
model for the symbolic analysis of EMV’s security. Our model
is written in Tamarin [12], [13], a state-of-the-art veriﬁcation
tool that has been used to study numerous real-world protocols,
including TLS 1.3 [14] and 5G authentication [15]. Tamarin
supports protocol veriﬁcation in the presence of powerful ad-
versaries and unboundedly many concurrent protocol sessions.
Our model supports the analysis of all properties that must
hold in any EMV transaction. An informal description of the
three most relevant properties is as follows:
1) Bank accepts terminal-accepted transactions: No trans-
action accepted by the terminal can be declined by the
bank.
2) Authentication to the terminal: All transactions accepted
by the terminal are authenticated by the card and, if
authorized online, the bank.
3) Authentication to the bank: All transactions accepted by
the bank are authenticated by the card and the terminal.
Our model faithfully considers the three roles present in an
EMV session: the bank, the terminal, and the card. Previous
symbolic models merge the terminal and the bank into a
single agent [16]–[18]. This merging incorrectly entails that
the terminal can verify all card-produced cryptographic proofs
that the bank can. This is incorrect as the card and the bank
share a symmetric key that is only known to them.
Using our model, we identify a critical violation of au-
thentication properties by the Visa contactless protocol: the
cardholder veriﬁcation method used in a transaction, if any, is
neither authenticated nor cryptographically protected against

modiﬁcation. We developed a proof-of-concept Android ap-
plication that exploits this to bypass PIN veriﬁcation by
mounting a man-in-the-middle attack that instructs the termi-
nal that PIN veriﬁcation is not required because the cardholder
veriﬁcation was performed on the consumer’s device (e.g.,
a mobile phone). This enables criminals to use any stolen
Visa card to pay for expensive goods without
the card’s
PIN. In other words, the PIN is useless in Visa contactless
transactions!
We have successfully tested our PIN bypass attack on real-
world terminals for a number of transactions with amounts
greater than the limit above which cardholder veriﬁcation is
required (which we will refer to as high-value transactions),
using Visa-branded cards such as Visa Credit, Visa Electron,
and V Pay cards. For example, we performed a transaction
of ca. $190 in an attended terminal in an actual store. As it
is now common for consumers to pay with their smartphones,
the cashier cannot distinguish the attacker’s actions from those
of any legitimate cardholder. We carried out all our tests using
our own cards, but we stress that the attack works for any Visa
card that the attacker possesses, in particular with stolen cards.
Our symbolic analysis using Tamarin also reveals that,
in an ofﬂine contactless transaction with a Visa or an old
Mastercard card, the card does not authenticate to the terminal
the Application Cryptogram (AC), which is a card-produced
cryptographic proof of the transaction that the terminal cannot
verify (only the card issuer can). This enables criminals to
trick the terminal into accepting an unauthentic ofﬂine
transaction. When the acquirer later submits the transaction
data as part of the clearing record, the issuing bank will detect
the wrong cryptogram, but the criminal is already long gone
with the goods. We did not test this attack on actual terminals
for ethical reasons as this would defraud the merchant.
Contributions
First, we present a comprehensive symbolic model of
the EMV standard that accounts for the three Ofﬂine Data
Authentication methods (SDA, DDA, and CDA),
the ﬁve
Cardholder Veriﬁcation Methods (no PIN, plaintext PIN, of-
ﬂine enciphered PIN, online PIN, and CDCVM), the two
types of Transaction Authorizations (ofﬂine and online), and
the two (major) types of contactless transactions (Visa and
Mastercard). Our model considers the three roles present in
a transaction, and supports the ﬁne-grained analysis of all
relevant security properties.
Second, we identify and demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time in
actual terminals, a practical attack that allows attackers to
make high-value payments with the victim’s card, without
knowledge of the card’s PIN. We also identify an attack that
allows one to effectively steal goods by tricking terminals
into accepting unauthentic ofﬂine transactions. Our attacks
demonstrate that EMV’s liability shift should be voided be-
cause credit card fraud is not necessarily the result of negligent
behavior of consumers or merchants.
Finally, based on our
full-scale, automatic, Tamarin-
supported analysis of EMV’s fundamental security properties,
we identify the EMV conﬁgurations that guarantee secure
transactions. Based on these conﬁgurations, we propose so-
lutions that can be implemented in the payment terminals and
rule out security breaches.
Note that our focus is on EMV’s design, not implementa-
tions themselves. In this way, we can end the penetrate-and-
patch arms race where attackers continually ﬁnd and exploit
protocol weaknesses. Of course this is only one part of the
overall picture, as attackers can still exploit implementation
weaknesses; but it is a substantial part and is also a prerequisite
for any “full stack” effort
to formally develop a veriﬁed
protocol down to the level of code.
Organization
In Section II we describe related work, focusing on previous
EMV security analyses. In Section III we provide background
on the EMV protocol. In Section IV we present our formal
model of EMV, focusing on how we model EMV’s numerous
conﬁgurations and how we deﬁne and analyze its security
properties. In Section V we present the results of this analysis.
Later, in Section VI, we describe an Android app that we
developed and used to show that our Tamarin ﬁndings can be
turned into real-world attacks. We also suggest improvements
to terminals that guarantee secure transactions. We draw
conclusions in Section VII.
Ethical Considerations
We carried out all our tests using our own credit and debit
cards. On April 30th, 2020, we notiﬁed Visa of the attacks
discovered. Also, we will not make our Android app available
to the public, at least not until the reported issues are resolved.
