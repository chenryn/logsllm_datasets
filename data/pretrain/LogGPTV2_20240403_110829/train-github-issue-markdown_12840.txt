When trying to use evaluateAll or dispatchEvent in a specific web page, an
TypeError: extraEngines is not iterable error is throw
Seems to be the same bug as #18641 that was closed due to lack of public
reproduction. This can be reproduced in public (see below)
Its similar to #23192 in the same web page / app but unlike the other bug this
occurs using the library also, not only the codegen
### System info
  * Playwright Version: [v1.33]
  * Operating System: [Windows 10]
  * Browser: [Chromium]
  * Other info:
### Source code
-[x] I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
    import { chromium, Page } from 'playwright'
    async function testSAWTypeError() {
      const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false })
      const context = await browser.newContext()
      const result = await context.newPage()
      await result.goto('https://saw.trixti.com.br/saw')
      const s = await result.locator('a').evaluateAll((els) => {
        return els.map((el) => el.textContent)
      })
      console.log(s)
      await result.locator('input#submitForm').dispatchEvent('click')
    }
**Steps**
  * Enter https://saw.trixti.com.br/saw
  * Try to call `locator.dispatchEvent` or `locator.evaluateAll`
**Expected**  
Should not crash
**Actual**
It crashes
