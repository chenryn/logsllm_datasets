signal strengths of neighboring eNodeBs.
In addition, according to the LTE speciﬁcation [41], RLF
report can include GPS coordinates [5] of UE at the time it
experienced the radio failure. As before, this feature is not
widely implemented yet.

VI. DOS ATTACKS ON LTE AIR INTERFACE
In this section, we demonstrate how an attacker can ex-
ploit two LTE speciﬁcation vulnerabilities to deny LTE, and
also GSM and 3G network services to subscribers. First, we
describe the attack background and present three types of
persistent DoS attacks labeled D1, D2, and D3. Later, we
discuss their impact on LTE subscribers and operator services.
A. Attack background
We exploit the EPS Mobility Management (EMM) protocol
messages which are required for control of UE mobility in
LTE networks. In particular, we exploit two functions of EMM
messages described below.
1. TAU procedure: One of the main function of EMM
protocol messages is to inform the network about UE’s present
location in the serving area of the operator. This allows the
MME to offer network services to the UE, e.g., when there
is a incoming call. For this purpose, UE notiﬁes the MME
of its current TA by sending a “TAU Request” message and
also includes its network modes. Generally, UE operates in
various network modes for voice and data connections as stated
in [11], but for this work we focus only on two modes: i) EPS
services (i.e., LTE services), ii) both EPS and non-EPS (i.e.,
GSM or 3G) services. During a TAU procedure, the UE and
MME agree on one of these modes depending on the type
of subscription (for example, USIM is subscribed for LTE
services), and network capabilities supported by the UE and
by the operator in a particular area.

During TAU procedure the network may deny some ser-
vices to UEs, for example if the subscriber’s USIM is not
authorized for LTE services or if the operator does not support
certain services in the serving area. The LTE speciﬁcation [11]
deﬁnes certain EMM procedures to convey such denial mes-
sages to UEs. Speciﬁcally, these are sent in “TAU Reject”
messages which are not integrity protected.
2. LTE Attach procedure: During an Attach procedure,
UE sends a list of its capabilities to the network in an
“Attach Request” message. In particular, these capabilities
include supported networks (such as LTE, GSM or 3G),
security algorithms, and other features as deﬁned in [11].
However, these capabilities are sent unprotected and hence,
the list can be altered by an attacker. To protect against MiTM
attacks, the LTE security architecture mandates reconﬁrmation
of previously negotiated security capabilities after the AKA
procedure [10]. In particular, the network sends an integrity-
protected message including the list of supported security
algorithms previously received from the UE. However, there
is no similar conﬁrmation for UE’s network capabilities.
B. Downgrade to non-LTE network services (D1)
We identify a vulnerability in the LTE speciﬁcation which
enables the following DoS attacks D1. We exploit the fact
that certain “TAU Reject” messages sent from the network are
accepted by UEs without any integrity protection. In particular,
there is no need of mutual authentication and security contexts
between the UE and network for accepting such reject mes-
sages. Note that, the attacker does not need any security keys
to send “TAU Reject” messages. Hence, the attacks can be
targeted towards any LTE subscribers within the range of the
rogue eNodeB. Similar types of attacks are also possible with
“Service Reject/ Attach Reject” messages.
As shown in Figure 8,
the UE sends “TAU Request”
message to attacker’s rogue eNodeB. Note that as the UE is
attached to the real network, this message can be integrity
protected using the existing NAS security context. However,
according to LTE speciﬁcation [11](section 4.4.5), this mes-
sage is not encrypted. As a result, rogue eNodeB decodes it and
responds with a “TAU Reject” message. The attacker includes
EMM cause number 7 “LTE services not allowed” into this
message. As no integrity protection is required, the victim’s UE
accepts the message. The UE proceeds to act on the indicated
rejection cause by deleting all existing EPS contexts associated
with the earlier (real) network.
As a result, UE updates its status to “EU3 ROAMING
NOT ALLOWED”7 and considers the USIM and hence the
UE as invalid for LTE services until it is rebooted or USIM
is re-inserted. Further, UE does not search for or attach to
legitimate LTE networks even if they are available in that area,
causing a denial of service. However, if supported, the UE
searches for GSM or 3G network in the same area to gain
network services. By downgrading subscribers, an attacker
could attempt to launch known 2G or 3G attacks, besides loss
of LTE services.
7It means that last TAU procedure was correctly performed, but reply from
the MME was negative due to roaming or subscription restrictions.

Fig. 9. DoS attack - denying all mobile network services (D2)
C. Denying all network services (D2)
D2 is similar to D1 but the result is different. The UE
initiates TAU request procedure and rogue eNodeB responds
with a TAU Reject message with the cause number 8 which
is “LTE and non-LTE services not allowed”. After receiving
this message, the UE sets LTE status to “EU3 ROAMING NOT
ALLOWED” and considers USIM invalid for the network until
it is rebooted or USIM is re-inserted. Further, it enters the
state EMM-DEREGISTERED: UE’s location is unknown to
the MME and is not reachable for any mobile services. As
a result, UE does not attempt to attach to LTE, GSM, or 3G
networks for normal services even if networks are available.
The UE remains in the EMM-DEREGISTERED state even it
moves to a new TA or even to a new city, thereby causing
a persistent denial of service. Signaling messages exchanged
between the UE and the rogue eNodeB are shown in Figure 9.
D. Denying selected services (D3)
In this attack, the active attacker modiﬁes messages ex-
changed between the eNodeB and UE. However, note that
this attack was not performed during our experiments due to
unavailability of UE baseband software.
The UE initiates an “Attach Request” message to the
eNodeB and this message is intercepted by the attacker. The
message contains “Voice domain preference and UE’s usage
setting” which informs the network about UE’s voice calling
capabilities. The attacker removes these capabilities from this
unprotected message and adds “Additional update type -
SMS only” before forwarding it to the network. The network
accepts this message and executes AKA protocol with the
UE to complete Attach procedure. However at this step, the
MME conﬁgures UE’s proﬁle with the received (modiﬁed)
capabilities, thereby allowing only SMS and data services.
When there is an incoming call for UE, the MME rejects it and
informs the cause to the subscriber who is calling. On the other
hand, if UE tries to make an outgoing voice call, the network
10
rejects this request and informs the cause. This is an example
of a bidding down attack. The denial is persistent since the
attack is effective even after the attacker has moved away.
However, the user can recover from the attack by restarting
the UE or moving to another TA. 3GPP speciﬁcations does
indeed mention a timer (T3245) that a UE can use to recover
from EMM DISCONNECTED state [43]. However, the use of
this timer is optional (none of the devices we tested implement
this timer). The default timer value (24-48 hours) is too large
in the case of DoS attacks.
E. Impact on end-users and operators
Unlike the LTE jamming DoS attacks described in [44], our
attacks are against UEs in a certain area instead of against LTE
networks. A successful attack would deny the target UE from
utilizing network services. Typically, the UE remains in non-
service state for some time period even if the attacker shuts
down his rogue eNodeB or moves away from attacking area.
Consequently, this attack is more serious than other types of
DoS attacks (for example jamming and RACH ﬂood [45] that
are difﬁcult to prevent). Impact of these attacks are as follows:
•
•
•
•
Subscriber’s UE may not alert the user about the un-
availability of legitimate services. However, depend-
ing on the alert notiﬁcation capabilities provided by
application layer of various mobile operating systems
installed on the UE, the subscriber could be notiﬁed
of limited services or no network connectivity status.
We noticed that there is no standard approach across
different mobile operating systems to indicate the type
of active network mode (e.g., 2G/GSM, 3G, LTE) to
the user.
Subscribers will not be able to receive or make nor-
mal calls and data connections. Hence, a signiﬁcant
loss is incurred to both network operators and their
subscribers. Network operators are not able to offer
services since subscribers are unavailable technically
and no billing would occur.
UE can still make emergency calls. However, emer-
gency calls are not possible when UE is attached to a
rogue eNodeB.
LTE-capable M2M devices which are not attended by
technicians on a daily basis could be blocked out from
network services for a long time. This is due to the
fact that M2M devices need to be rebooted or USIM
needs to re-inserted to recover from the attacks.
VII. ATTACK FEASIBILITY AND AMPLIFICATION
In this section, we discuss the feasibility of both location
leak and DoS attacks against popular LTE smartphones and
methods to amplify the coverage range of our attacks.
Several of the vulnerabilities we exploited are in the LTE
speciﬁcations rather than in the UE’s baseband software.
Therefore, all LTE-capable UEs conforming to these spec-
iﬁcations are affected. For evaluation, we selected popular
smartphones incorporating baseband implementations from top
vendors who dominate the market share worldwide [46]. We
successfully veriﬁed that all these phones are vulnerable to
our attacks. In addition, all UEs have the implementation
vulnerability leading to attack L3.
We further investigated on how UEs recover from DoS
attacks. We found out that all UEs recover after rebooting
or re-inserting the USIM. Additionally, UEs having baseband
from most vendors can recover by toggling the ﬂight mode.
Attack ampliﬁcation: Related to our passive attacks, we
determined the average cell radius of a major operator in a
city is 800 meters for the 2.6 GHz and 1 km for the 800
MHz frequency band. The USRP B210 used for our attacks
has a maximum output power of 20dbm (100mW) [47] with
a coverage range of 50 to 100 meters. However, the signal
coverage area can be increased with a suitable power ampli-
ﬁer. Speciﬁcally, based on the COST 231 radio propagation
model [48], we calculated that by mounting a USRP at a height
of 10m (e.g., on a street lamp) and amplifying the power by 10
dB, it is possible to deny LTE and non-LTE services for every
subscriber in a cell. For a reference, OpenBTS projects [49],
[50] use USRPs to provide GSM coverage in rural areas with
>2 km coverage with an external power ampliﬁer and antenna.
Similarly, signal coverage area of our rogue eNodeB could be
increased to demonstrate feasibility of the attack.
VIII. SECURITY ANALYSIS
In this section, we discuss vulnerabilities discovered in the
speciﬁcations and their impact on LTE security. We explain the
background behind the vulnerabilities by considering various
trade-offs between security and criteria like availability and
performance. We show that the equilibrium points in the trade-
offs have shifted today compared to where they were when the
LTE security architecture was being designed. We also discuss
countermeasures for the vulnerabilities that made our attacks
possible. Table II summarizes our analysis.
A. Possible trade-offs
Security vs Availability: We demonstrated a vulnerability in
the LTE RRC protocol speciﬁcation that allows the adversary
to obtain unprotected measurement reports from UEs (L3).
We consider the following two angles to explain the trade-
off. On one hand, in some cases network operators require
unprotected reports for troubleshooting purposes. In particular,
if the UE is not able to establish connection with the eNodeB
then it may be necessary to send measurement reports without
protection in order allow the network to identify technical
reason behind the fault. This seems to be the reasons behind
the note in LTE RRC speciﬁcation which points out
that
the 3GPP Radio Access Network (RAN2) working group
decided to permit UEs to send reports even without security
activation [5]. On the other hand, during the design work
for the LTE security architecture, the 3GPP security working
group (SA3) suggested that all RRC protocol messages should
be sent in encrypted form [51]. Hence, the vulnerability in
RRC protocol speciﬁcation is a conscious exception to this
security design guidance [5]. Clearly, 3GPP has concluded
that in this particular case the requirement of having network
availability all the time to all UEs outweighs security concerns
related to subscribers’ privacy.
Security vs Performance: We observed that UEs are required
to reboot or re-insert USIM after DoS attacks in order to
11
regain network services. This behavior, exhibited by all LTE
devices we tested, is according to the LTE speciﬁcation. Since
the network denies services for valid reject causes described
in [11], the UE restricts itself from re-initiating LTE (or any
mobile network) Attach procedure in order to conserve battery
power. In addition, frequent unsuccessful Attach requests from
UEs would increase signaling load on the network. These
are the reasons why the LTE speciﬁcation requires the UE
to reboot or re-insert USIM to recover from reject messages.
This preference of performance over security leaves LTE
subscribers vulnerable to the DoS attacks (D1 & D2).
As another example, during Attach, UE’s security capabili-
ties are sent back to it for conﬁrmation after security activation
in order to protect against bidding down attacks. This is an
application of the well-known ‘matching history’ principle
used in security protocol design [52]. However, UE’s network
capabilities are not protected in similar manner, enabling a
different type of bidding down attack (D3). The reason for
not applying the matching history principle to all negotiated
parameters, as discussed in VI-A, indicates another trade-off
where added security has not outweighed performance loss
due to the full application of the matching history principle.
To apply the matching history principle to all parameters would
have required the inclusion of a cryptographic hash of all the
parameters, instead of the parameters themselves. However,
conﬁrming only the security information capabilities, which
take up much less space (only a few bits) compared to a full
cryptographic hash, minimizes the overhead in signaling.
A third example we observed is that in some operator
networks, GUTIs are not changed even after three days of
usage (L1). LTE speciﬁcations do not mandate any GUTI
reallocation frequency, leaving it to as a policy decision to
operators. One possible reason for the low GUTI-change
frequency is the operators’ wish to reduce signaling overhead
by trading off privacy.
Security vs Functionality: Our attacks that
leak coarse-
grained location information by using social network mes-
saging services (L2) is an example of the tension between
security and functionality. The introduction of TCP/IP based
data communication on top of mobile communication infras-
tructures has greatly expanded the functionality that third party
developers can build for these networks. But such a ﬂexible
software architecture makes it harder to avoid or detect the
type of vulnerability that led to this attack. Furthermore, even
if individual app developers would ﬁx their applications (e.g.,
Facebook could change the application architecture of their
Messenger application to ensure that messages that end up
in the ”Other” box do not
trigger paging requests), other
application developers may make similar mistakes. To avoid
such vulnerabilities in a modern mobile communication system
like LTE, it would require signiﬁcant developer outreach and
education to help them design and build mobile optimized
applications [53].
Summary: The design philosophy of LTE security required
leaving some safety margin in security mechanisms in order
to protect against changes in trade-offs. However, in the above
cases the safety margins turn out to be too narrow. As a
general learning on an abstract concept level, it would be
better to include agility in the security mechanisms instead of
a rigid safety margin. The forthcoming ﬁfth generation (5G)
technology will offer better possibilities to engineer agility and
