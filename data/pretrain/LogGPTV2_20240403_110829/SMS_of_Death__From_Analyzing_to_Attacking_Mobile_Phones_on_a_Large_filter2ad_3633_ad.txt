circumvent restrictions Bulk SMS operator might have
in different countries.
SS7 Access: With direct access to the Signaling Sys-
tem 7 (SS7) of the Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN) an attacker can very easily send SMS messages
in large quantities, for example to send SMS spam [25].
Figure 4 shows the basic network connections of a mo-
bile network operator. SMS sending via SS7 also has the
advantage of not being easily traceable, thus an attacker
can stay hidden for a longer period of time. Addition-
ally, SMS messages sent via SS7 are not restricted by
the Bulk SMS Operators (APIs) in terms of content or
header information that they contain.
5.3 Reducing the Number of Messages
There is one issue left with our attack. That is how can
one determine the type of mobile phone that is connected
to a speciﬁc phone number. If money does not play a
role in carrying out the attack this issue is easily resolved.
The attacker just sends multiple SMS messages, each one
containing the payload for a speciﬁc type of phone, to
each phone number. One of the messages will trigger the
bug if the phone is vulnerable at all. This works well
but is not optimal. To reduce the number of messages
an attacker has to send we developed a technique that
allows the attacker to determine what kind of phone is
connected to a speciﬁc phone number. Actually we can
only determine if a speciﬁc malicious message has an
effect on the phone that is connected to a speciﬁc number.
Our method abuses a speciﬁc feature present in the
SMS standard. This feature is called recipient noti-
ﬁcation, it is indicated through the TP-Status-Report-
Request ﬂag in an SMS message. If the ﬂag is set the
SMSC notiﬁes the sender of the message when the re-
cipient has received the message. Most Bulk SMS oper-
ators support this feature through their APIs. Our method
works by measuring the delay between sending the mes-
sage and receiving the reception notiﬁcation.
The technique works as follows: First, we send the
message containing the payload for crash(1). Second,
when we receive the receipt for that message we send the
payload for crash(2). Third, we measure the time differ-
ence between the two notiﬁcations. If the difference is
equal we continue with the next payload. If the differ-
ence between both notiﬁcations is signiﬁcant we deter-
mine that the ﬁrst message crashed the phone. The phone
needed to reboot and register on the network before be-
ing able to accept the next message. If there is no noti-
ﬁcation we determine that the phone did not receive the
message because it crashed before completely accepting
the message. Fourth, we continue until all crash pay-
loads are sent. If none of them trigger, the phone number
is removed from the hit-list. The method can be opti-
mized through ordering the crash payloads according to
the popularity of mobile phones in the targeted country.
With this method an attacker can optimize a hit-list
during an ongoing attack by matching bug-to-phone-
number. This optimized hit-list could as well be used for
highly targeted attacks. For example against the network
operator as described in Section 5.5, which explains our
attack scenarios.
5.4 Network Assisted Attack Ampliﬁcation
Some of the bugs we discovered prevent the phone from
acknowledging the SMS message to the network. Fig-
ure 2 shows the states that happen during a message
transfer from the network to the phone. In the case of
some of our bugs (Nokia S40 and Sony Ericsson; Bug
Characterization Section 4.10) the message RP-ACK is
not sent by the phone. This leads the network to believe
that the message was not received, therefore, the SMSC
will try to resend the SMS message to the phone. This re-
delivery attempt is a perfect attack ampliﬁer somewhat
similar to smurf attacks [26] on IP networks.

delivery attempt
Figure 5: Timing of SMS message delivery attempts.
In our tests, sending malicious SMS messages over
real operator networks, we discovered that operators
have different re-transmit timings, shown in Figure 5.
Furthermore, they also seem to have different transmit
queues. We measured the delivery timings of some Ger-
man mobile network operators in order to determine how
one could abuse the delivery attempts for improving our
Denial-of-Service attacks. We conducted the test by at-
tacking one of our Sony Ericsson devices and monitoring
the phone using the Bluetooth method described in Sec-
tion 4.4.
The tests were carried out on the networks of Voda-
fone, T-Mobile, O2 (Telefonica), and E-Plus. The initial
11
delivery attempt is at minute 0. It shows that all opera-
tors do a ﬁrst re-transmit after 1 minute, and a few more
re-transmits every 5 minutes. In addition to what Fig-
ure 5 shows, Vodafone does an additional re-delivery 24
hours after the last delivery shown in the graph. O2 also
attempts an additional re-delivery 20 hours after the last
delivery shown in the graph.
Through the same test we determined that SMS mes-
sages are not queued, but have an individual re-transmit
timer. That means an attacker can send multiple mali-
cious SMS messages to a victim’s phone with a short
delay between each message and thus can increase the
effect of the network assisted attack by sending multiple
messages.
5.5 Attack Scenarios and Impact
There are multiple possible attack scenarios such as or-
ganized crime going after the end-user, the mobile op-
erator, and the manufacturer to demand money. Attacks
could also be carried out for fun by script kiddies and the
like. Below we discuss some possible scenarios. We ac-
knowledge that some scenarios such as the attack against
individuals are more likely then an attack against a man-
ufacturer.
Individuals: Individuals could be pressured to pay a
few Euros in order to keep their phone operational. This
has happened with the Ikke.A [35] worm that requested
the user to pay 5 Euros in order to get back the control
over their iPhone. In our case the victim could be forced
to send a text message to a premium rate number in order
to be taken off the hit-list.
Another attack against an individual or a group could
aim to prevent them from communicating. This can be
efﬁciently carried out if the target uses a SIM card with
security PIN enabled, as we describe in Section 4.9.
Operators: Operators could be threatened to have all
their customers attacked. Such an attack would mainly
kill the operator’s reputation as being reliable. The op-
erator might also lose money due to people being un-
able to call and send text messages. In order to have a
global impact such an attack has to be carried out on a
very large scale for a longer time. As a result, customers
could possibly terminate their contract with the operator.
Such extortion scams were and still are popular on the
Internet [8].
Furthermore, the operator’s mobile network can be
attacked directly or as a side effect of an large attack
against its users. This could work when thousands of at-
tacked phones drop off the network and try to re-connect
at the same time. This can cause an overload of the back-
end infrastructure such as the HLR. This kind of attack
seems likely since mobile networks are not optimized for
these speciﬁc kinds of requests. A similar attack based
It is not nor-
on unusual requests was shown in [36].
mal that thousands of phones try to connect and authen-
ticate at the same time over and over again. To optimize
this DoS attack, the attacker needs to make sure to tar-
get phones connected to different BTSs and MSCs (Fig-
ure 4) of the targeted operator in order to circumvent bot-
tlenecks such as the air interface at the BTS. A clogged
air interface would throttle the attack.
Manufacturers: Likewise manufacturers could be
threatened to have their brand name destroyed or weak-
ened by attacking random people owning their speciﬁc
brand of mobile phones. The attack could cost them
twice. Once for the bad reputation and second for re-
placement devices. Even if the phones are not broken
victims of such an attack will still try to claim their de-
vice broken to get a replacement.
Public Distress: A carefully placed attack during a
time of public distress could lead to large scale prob-
lems and possibly a panic. One example occurred in
Estonia [19] in 2007 when a group of people carried
out a Denial-of-Service attack against the countries Inter-
net infrastructure. Additionally, cutting off certain user
groups such as ﬁreman or police ofﬁcers during an emer-
gency situation would have a critical impact. Not ev-
ery country has special infrastructure for emergency per-
sonal, and, therefore, rely on mobile phones to communi-
cate. This is even true in countries like Germany where
every police ofﬁcer carries a mobile phone since their
two-way-radios are often not usable.
6 Countermeasures
In this section we present countermeasures to detect and
prevent the kind of attacks we developed. First, we
present a mechanism to detect our and similar attacks
through monitoring for a speciﬁc misbehavior. Second,
we discuss ﬁltering of SMS messages. Filtering can be
done on either the phones themselves or on the network.
We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of
them. Third, we brieﬂy discuss ampliﬁcation attacks.
6.1 Detection
To prevent our attacks, operators ﬁrst need to be able
to detect them. Detection is not very easy since the
operator does not get to look inside the phone during
runtime. Therefore, the only possible way to monitor the
phone is through the network. We propose the following:
Monitor Phone Connectivity Status: Monitor if a
phone disconnects from the network right after receiving
an SMS message.
Log last N SMS Messages: Log the last N SMS mes-
sages sent to a particular phone in order to analyze pos-
12
sible malicious messages after a crash was detected. Use
the message as input for SMS ﬁlters/ﬁrewall.
Use IMEI to Detect Phone Type: The brand and
type of a mobile phone can be derived from the IMEI
(International Manufacturer Equipment Identity). This
is useful to correlated malicious SMS messages to a
speciﬁc brand and type of phone.
Using this technique it is possible to catch malicious
SMS messages that cause phones to reboot and lose net-
work connectivity. This should especially help to catch
unknown payloads that cause crashes. Such a monitor is
also capable of detecting if a large attack is in progress by
correlating multiple SMS-receive-disconnect events in a
certain time-frame.
6.2 SMS Filtering
SMS ﬁltering can be implemented either directly on the
phone or within the operator’s network. Both possibil-
ities have inherent beneﬁts and drawbacks that are pre-
sented in this section.
It is important to reconsider the process of SMS
delivery.
First, an SMS message is sent from the
sender phone to the senders SMSC. Next, the senders
SMSC queries for the SMSC of the recipient and
delivers the message to the responsible SMSC. Fi-
nally, the relevant SMSC locates the recipient’s phone
and delivers the SMS message via the BTS Over-the-Air.
Client-side SMS Filtering would need to be done
right after the modem of the phone received and demod-
ulated all the frames carrying the SMS message and be-
fore pushing it up the application stack. The ﬁlter would
need to parse the SMS message and check for known bad
messages similar to signature-based antivirus software or
a packet ﬁlter ﬁrewalls. The problem with this solution
is the update of the signatures. Of course, the parser
in the SMS ﬁlter must be bug free otherwise the attack
just moves from the phone software to the ﬁlter software.
Also, devices that are already in the ﬁeld would not proﬁt
from such a ﬁlter since only new phones will have this.
Also, newer phones will likely not contain bugs that are
known at the time they are manufactured. Therefore, we
believe network-side ﬁlters make more sense.
Network-side SMS Filtering takes place on the
SMSC of the mobile network operator. Therefore, it can
inspect all incoming and outgoing SMS messages. There
are multiple advantages of network-side ﬁltering. First,
the ﬁlter software runs on the network, therefore, it cov-
ers all mobile phones connected to that network. Second,
changing the ﬁlter rules can be done in one central place.
Third, malicious SMS messages are not sent out to the
destination mobile phones, therefore, reducing network
load during an attack.
Network-side ﬁlters also have drawbacks. First, if a
phone is roaming within another operator’s network, the
SMS message does not travel through the network of the
home operator. Thus the ﬁlters are not touched. This is
the only advantage of phone-side SMS ﬁltering. In this
case the user becomes attackable as soon as he leaves
his home network. For traveling business people in Eu-
rope, this is quite normal. The GSMA already has a solu-
tion for this issue called SMS homerouting. SMS Home-
routing as speciﬁed in [11] deﬁnes that SMS messages
are always routed through the receiver’s home-network.
Meaning that all SMS messages travel through SMSCs
of his service provider at home. SMS messages, there-
fore, can be ﬁltered by the receiver’s service provider.
The second issue with network-side ﬁltering is privacy.
In order to do SMS ﬁltering the operator must be allowed
to inspect SMS messages. This could be an issue in some
countries where mobile telephony falls under special reg-
ulations.
6.3 Preventing Network Ampliﬁcation
Attack ampliﬁcation through re-transmissions of SMS
messages should be avoided since this greatly helps an
attacker. We suggest that operators limit the number of
re-transmissions. Some operators re-send the messages
10 times, this seems unnecessary.
7 Conclusions
In this paper we have shown how to conduct vulnerabil-
ity analysis of feature phones. Feature phones are not
open in any way, the hardware and software are both
closed and thus do not support any classical debugging
methods. Throughout our work we have created analy-
sis tools based on a small GSM base station. We use the
base station to send SMS payloads to our test phones and
to monitor their behavior. Through this testing we were
able to identify vulnerabilities in mobile phones built by
six major manufacturers. The discovered vulnerabilities
can be abused for Denial-of-Service attacks. Our attacks
are signiﬁcant because of the popularity of the affected
models – an attacker could potentially interrupt mobile
communication on a large scale. Our further analysis
of the mobile phone network infrastructure revealed that
networks conﬁgured in a certain way can be used to am-
plify our attack. In addition, our attack can be used to not
only attack the mobile handsets, but through their misbe-
havior can be used to carry out an attack against the core
of the mobile phone network.
To detect and prevent these kind of attacks we suggest
a set of countermeasures. We conceived a method to de-
13
tect our and similar attacks by monitoring for a speciﬁc
behavior.
