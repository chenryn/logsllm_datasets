User: I am trying to make a program in c++, but i cant make the program because in one part of the code I need to run a python program from c++ and I dont know how to do it. I've been trying many ways of doing it but none of them worked. So the code should look sometihnglike this:somethingtoruntheprogram("pytestx.py"); or something close to that. Id prefer doing it without python.h. I just need to execute this program, I need to run the program because I have redirected output and input from the python program with sys.stdout and sys.stdin to text files and then I need to take data from those text files and compare them. I am using windows.
Assistant: There's POSIX popen and on Windows _popen, which is halfway between exec and system. It offers the required control over stdin and stdout, which system does not. But on the other hand, it's not as complicated as the exec family of functions.
