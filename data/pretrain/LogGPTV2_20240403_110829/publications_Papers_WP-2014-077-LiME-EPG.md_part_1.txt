1 Introduction
Nowadays,thecontentthattelevision(TV)stationsproduceandprovideisusuallynot
limited only to the TV business; many such companies provide further information
and services over the internet. On the other hand, internet users can produce a signif-
icant amount of data related to TV content through collaborative services, like blogs,
news/articlesrecords,socialnetworksandon-linerankingsystems.Althoughthegen-
eration of information is dynamic and has multiples sources, it is not usually contex-
tualized/linked.Thislackofintegrationmakesitiseasyforpartsoftheinformationto
beleftunconsumedbyusers.I.e.,twodifferentpiecesofinformationregardingasame

ThePortugueseTVserviceproviderMEO1 hasanElectronicProgrammingGuide
(EPG)2. The lack of contextualization of information is visible in MEO: its EPG in-
formation is poor and typically contains only the basic data about each TV program.
Linking Internet and EPG content, i.e., performing the enrichment of TV programs’
informationwithInternetmaterial,wouldallowustobringaddedvaluetoTVservices

2 ProblemDefinitionandObjectives
On a daily basis, MEO viewers often use the EPG to select which channel/program
they will watch. However, MEO’s EPG contains poor information regarding TV pro-
gramsbroadcasts.Figure1illustrateshowscarcetheinformationprovidedis.Although

the EPG structure is able to support more details, only about half of the data fields
are currently being used. Our goal is to enrich the EPG (creating the EPG+) thus al-
lowingMEOclientstomakebetterdecisionsregardlessofwhethertheywouldliketo

In this project we focus the enrichment process on a smaller part of the problem

Both objectives share a common problem which is the language of content: MEO

language.Thus,theenrichmentmustbebasedonInternetcontentsinPortuguese.This
requirementcreatesbarriersregardingtheusageofexternaltoolsforannotationofcon-
tent and for processing natural language as well as the sources to be used to collect
externalinformation.
We believe that the enrichment process we developed can be expanded to other
domainsbesidesTVprograms.E.g.,othertypesofmultimediacontent,suchasmusic
tracks,softwareanditsdocumentation,services,amongothers.
3 RelatedWork
One of the main projects regarding the enrichment of video/television content is No-
Tube [1,5,2]. The main goal of NoTube is to prepare TV for the future Internet ad-
dressingchallengesofTVcontentubiquityandchoice,personalizationandintegration.
NoTube enriches its EPG by linking its contents and metadata to concepts from Link
Data cloud using LUPedia 8. In our project we do this type of enrichment in a very
similar way. Since LUPedia does not support the portuguese language we had to use
other external services with the same functionalities as LUPedia. Another component
on NoTube’s enrichment is the personalization regarding each user. NoTube collects
andprocessesdatafromsocialnetworks,profileseachuserandthensuggestcontents
available on the EPG or in their system. NoTube also have an ANTS [9] (Automatic
Newscast Transcription System) system that analyses the video stream, identifies the
broadcastofnewscastandtagsthem.Inaccordancewiththeprofileofeachuserdiffer-
entnewscanbedelivered,andthatishowoursolutiondiffersfromNoTube’sapproach.
OurgoalistoenrichtheEPGwithnewsarticlesrelatedtoeachTVprogramandtopro-
vide them to every user. Also, the news articles used are collected from web sources
andnotextractedfromthebroadcastofagivenchannel.

SinceweproposetoenrichthecurrentMEOEPG,whichisprovidedbySAPOEPG
service, our system also uses the information from SAPO. After collecting the EPG,
a classification of each broadcast (e.g. movie, documentary, sports, among others) is
done. This classification of programs allows us to know the nature of each broadcast
andpossiblyrelatevariousbroadcasts.
