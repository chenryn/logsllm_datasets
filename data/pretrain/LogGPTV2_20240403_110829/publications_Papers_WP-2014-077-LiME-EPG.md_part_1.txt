**Abstract:**  
Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) systems are software applications running on set-top boxes that provide broadcast programming and scheduling information to users of TV services. Although the Internet continuously generates vast amounts of web data, some of which is related to TV programs, current EPG systems do not leverage this information to enrich the data they provide to users. To address this untapped opportunity, we have developed a prototype that gathers web data from various Internet sources in multiple formats and integrates it with the information provided by EPG systems to users. We describe our prototype, evaluate the achieved enrichments, and present our results and directions for future work.

### 1. Introduction
Television (TV) stations today often produce content that extends beyond traditional TV broadcasts, providing additional information and services over the internet. Additionally, internet users generate significant amounts of data related to TV content through collaborative platforms such as blogs, news articles, social networks, and online ranking systems. Despite the dynamic and multi-source nature of this information, it is often not contextualized or linked, leading to fragmented and underutilized data. This lack of integration creates an opportunity for service enrichment, which we explore in our work.

The Portuguese TV service provider MEO has an Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) that typically contains only basic information about each TV program. By linking Internet and EPG content, we can enhance the value of TV services for viewers by increasing the contextualization of TV content.

Recently, PT Innovation has been investing in improving its MEO service with new technologies and software. In this process, we identified the opportunity to enrich MEO with freely available Internet data, such as from Linked Data (or Linked Open Data - LOD), to provide a better TV experience. As a result, we developed the improved EPG+ system.

In this paper, we detail the development of the EPG+ system from its definition to implementation. Section 2 provides a detailed view of the problem and objectives. Section 3 presents a summary of similar projects. Section 4 explains the chosen use case and how the EPG+ system will be integrated with the MEO service. Section 5 presents the system architecture and the adopted solution. Section 6 details the technologies used for implementation. Section 7 presents two evaluations of the developed prototype. Section 8 summarizes possible improvements for future work. The conclusions in Section 9 close the paper.

### 2. Problem Definition and Objectives
MEO viewers frequently use the EPG to select channels and programs. However, MEO's EPG contains limited information about TV broadcasts. Figure 1 illustrates the scarcity of the provided information. Although the EPG structure can support more details, only about half of the data fields are currently used. Our goal is to enrich the EPG (creating the EPG+) to help MEO clients make better decisions, whether they want to watch or record a program.

In this project, we focus on enriching soccer games and TV series. The enrichment is based on news articles extracted from predefined Internet sources and annotated with semantic links to DBPedia resources.

The goals of this work are:
1. **Enrichment of the EPG with Internet content:** There are technical challenges in extracting information from different sources such as APIs, web services, RSS feeds, and web scraping. Since each TV program has its own broadcast time, reasoning is needed to determine if the extracted content is outdated.
2. **Enrichment of the EPG with LOD concepts:** We aim to create links between the EPG content and LOD cloud concepts, allowing for broader knowledge and contextualization of TV programs.

Both objectives face the challenge of language: MEO is provided to Portuguese citizens, so the content must be in Portuguese. This requirement creates barriers regarding the use of external tools for annotation and natural language processing, as well as the sources for collecting external information.

We believe that the enrichment process we developed can be extended to other domains, such as music tracks, software documentation, and other types of multimedia content.

### 3. Related Work
One of the main projects related to the enrichment of video/television content is NoTube [1,5,2]. NoTube aims to prepare TV for the future Internet by addressing challenges of TV content ubiquity, choice, personalization, and integration. NoTube enriches its EPG by linking its contents and metadata to concepts from the Linked Data cloud using LUPedia [8]. Our project performs a similar type of enrichment, but since LUPedia does not support the Portuguese language, we use other external services with similar functionalities. Another component of NoTube’s enrichment is personalization, where it collects and processes data from social networks, profiles each user, and suggests content. NoTube also has an ANTS [9] (Automatic Newscast Transcription System) that analyzes video streams, identifies newscasts, and tags them. Our approach differs in that we aim to enrich the EPG with news articles related to each TV program and provide them to all users, rather than personalizing content.

Choudhury and Breslin [4] developed a framework to annotate and retrieve web videos with light semantics. The framework collects metadata through APIs and RSS feeds, models the data according to an ontology, processes the content for concept extraction, integrates the data with the Linked Data cloud, and extracts semantic relations. The content is processed for concept learning using textual term tagging and entity recognition with OpenCalais. The next step is the integration of data with the Linked Data cloud, where they link their content with DBPedia resources. Our solution uses different external services (DBPediaSpotlight and AlchemyAPI) for identification and annotation with DBPedia resources, but the enrichment philosophy is similar.

### 4. Approach
Our enrichment system is intended to be integrated with the current EPG system provided by MEO. Figure 2 shows the integration scenario of the EPG+ system with the existing MEO system.

**Figure 2: Integration of EPG+ with PT Innovation Systems**

MEO clients access the EPG information through the set-top box (STB), implemented over the Microsoft MediaRoom Presentation Framework, an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) framework. The STB is fed with information from multiple sources, including MEO Magazine, managed by PT Innovation, and various applications that use feeds provided by SAPO (e.g., entertainment, economics, highlights). Our EPG+ system follows a similar integration scheme, running in the back-end to collect data, perform enrichment, and store it in its own database. The MEO STB then sends requests to our system for EPG+ information.

Since we propose to enrich the current MEO EPG, which is provided by the SAPO EPG service, our system also uses SAPO's information. After collecting the EPG, we classify each broadcast (e.g., movie, documentary, sports). This classification allows us to understand the nature of each broadcast and potentially relate various broadcasts.

We restrict the types of programs to be enriched to soccer games and TV series. Our enrichment uses news articles from a pre-determined set of sources. The extraction of news articles is continuous and collects various pieces of information such as titles, subtitles, descriptions, images, and video links. This is done via an annotation process that identifies named entities in the text and links them with resources available in LOD datasets. For these annotations, we use DBPediaSpotlight and AlchemyAPI. AlchemyAPI, which is free and supports Portuguese, is crucial for entity detection. After detecting the entities, we use DBPediaSpotlight to annotate them with links to Wikipedia. The final step is the association between news articles and TV programs through matching the annotations made to both contents, resulting in a list of ordered news articles related to each TV program.

### 5. System Architecture
The system independently gathers new information from the SAPO EPG every six hours, classifies it, and stores the results in a database. The extraction of news articles is independent, and for each Internet source, we defined an hourly verification for new information via RSS or HTML scraping. The collected information is mapped into the EPG+ data structure and sent to a system buffer. The system then controls which television programs are eligible for the enrichment process and searches for related news articles in the buffer. When a relation is found, the news article is added to the TV program and stored in the database.

#### 5.1 Architecture
We use the FMC (Fundamental Modeling Concepts) graphical notation [7,8] to define the system's architecture, as shown in Figure 3.

**Figure 3: EPG+ System Architecture**

This architecture consists of four main components: EPG Harvester, System Controller, Web Interface, and Storage Management. The EPG Harvester gathers EPG information from the SAPO EPG through a web service. An internal module extracts and classifies the EPG information using PT Innovation’s classifier SmartMEO and IMDB information to confirm classifications. After harvesting and classification, the data is sent to the Storage Management and stored in the database.

The System Controller is the central broker, controlling all other components. It keeps track of the current state of the EPG+ and, when updates are needed, makes requests to the EPG Harvester for new information. It also contains modules that feed the system with news articles extracted from the Internet. There is an instantiation of the News Articles Gatherer module that handles the extraction and collection of news articles.
