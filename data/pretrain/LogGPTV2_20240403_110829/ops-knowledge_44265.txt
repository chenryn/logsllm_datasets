User:  Please explain the common types of security vulnerabilities, such as XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc., and provide preventive measures.
Assistant: 1. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting Attack) Type of security vulnerability: The attacker injects malicious scripts into the webpage. When other users browse the page, the malicious scripts will be executed, and the attackers can use the scripts to steal user information or perform various malicious operations. Preventive measures: Filter the input content, for example, use HTML tag filter to filter unsafe input content. The content input by the user needs to be escaped, for example, use the escape() function or library function of JavaScript to avoid parsing the input content into JavaScript code. 2. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) security vulnerability type: Attackers use the user's logged-in website credentials (cookies) to send malicious requests without the user's knowledge, thereby performing malicious operations. Countermeasures: Use verification codes to verify identity information. Change the key operation to POST submission, and add information to determine the source site to curb the forgery of HTTP Referer. 3. SQL injection security vulnerability type: Attackers obtain or tamper with website data by injecting malicious SQL statements. Preventive measures: use parameterized query or ORM framework to filter out illegal input content. The content entered by the user needs to be strictly verified to avoid SQL injection attacks. 4. File upload vulnerability Security vulnerability type: Attackers attack the system by uploading dangerous files (such as malicious scripts, viruses, etc.). Precautions: Check the file type and file content, and limit the type and size of uploaded files. Files that are allowed to be uploaded must be placed in a directory protected by the web server, and direct access to this directory is prohibited. 5. Logical loophole Security loophole type: Attackers use logic loopholes written by programmers to bypass some security restrictions or complete unauthorized operations. Preventive measures: When writing code, it is necessary to strictly follow the design requirements to avoid writing incomplete code. Conduct code audits to detect potential logic holes or unforeseen situations. Strengthen log monitoring to detect abnormal situations in time.
