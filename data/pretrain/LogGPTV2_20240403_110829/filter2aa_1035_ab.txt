First question…
How do we attack it?
Malicious Visualizations…

Basic Notion
Denial of Information vs. InfoVis
A malicious entity can attack humans through
information visualization systems by:
– Inserting malicious data into data stream
– Altering timing of data
Note that we do not assume any alteration or 
modification of data, such as that provided from 
legitimate sources or stored in databases.

Get you fired Attack
Got some slick, nobody's fool
sysadmin you need to get past?
Well, cook up a portscan that will 
look like a giant 
Boss walks past, geek gets fired, 
replaced by bosses moron 
nephew who is more than happy 
to give you the keys to the server 
when you call and identify 
yourself as the Hamburglar.

Countermeasures
• Assume an intelligent and well informed adversary
• Design system with malicious data in mind
• Assume your tool (and source) are in the hands of 
an attacker
• Train users to be alert for manipulation
• Validate data
• Assume your infrastructure will be attacked
• In worst case, assume your attacker has knowledge 
about specific users
• Design visualizations/vis systems that are resistant 
to attack
• If you can’t defeat attack, at least facilitate 
detection
• Use intelligent defaults
• Provide adequate customization
