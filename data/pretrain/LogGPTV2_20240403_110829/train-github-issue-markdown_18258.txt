Hello team
I have created a Mac app using electron framework (electron-packager) and
embedded it within my another Mac app (non-electron).
I have already added sandbox entitlement in my electron mac app.
I'm trying to get our non-AppStore version of my main app through Apples
notarization.
It fails for the notarization process
(https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev88332a81e)  
because it missed the 'runtime' flag during codesign for the Helper App.
Therefore I need to create a Mac app which :
  1. is compatible with app store submission
  2. can be signed as runtime (seems to be equal to hardened runtime : https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devf87a2ac8f) for non-AppStore submission and notarization.
Help would be appreciated.
Thanka
