#### What Does the NSA Think?
- The NSA has publicly acknowledged:
  - The inevitability of mobile computing.
  - The need to support cloud-based services, even for handling secret data in the field.
  - If these solutions work for them, they can also work for you.

#### How Does the Cloud Know?
- Who you are?
- Where you are?
- Is your computer acting on your behalf?

#### Device Integrity
- A device is made of silicon, but it might be pretending to be someone else.
- Define device integrity as "truth-telling":
  - Is the device accurately asserting delegation?
  - Is it faithfully representing the user's intent?

#### Current Technology Landscape
- **Why are mobile devices less secure?**
  - Inconvenience of strong passwords.
  - Antivirus software is not up to the task.
  - User-owned devices (BYOD/consumerization trends).
- **Security Features in Mobile Devices:**
  - Screen lock.
  - Secure storage.
  - TrustZone & Trusted Execution Environment.
  - Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

#### Mobile Vulnerabilities
- Rootkits have become more challenging, but malicious apps are easier to create.
- Mobile threat landscape:
  - Easy to steal the device.
  - Easy to steal services.
  - Easy to install apps that steal data.
  - Even remote eavesdropping.

#### What is Needed to Be Secure?
- Encrypt user data.
- Sandbox applications.
- Implement secure, measured boot (TPM).
- Use remote platform attestation.

#### Using a Hardware Root of Trust
- **Device receives TPM-bound token:**
  - Sends the token to a relying party to prove its status.
  - The token can carry a decryption key.
- **If the device is measured to be insecure:**
  - The good guys win!
  - The machine needs to be reset to clean it.

#### What is Remote Attestation?
- Enabled by the TPM, remote attestation allows a server to verify the truth about the client.
- Uses the root of trust to measure the boot chain and configuration.
- The TPM attests to device attributes, providing rootkit-resistant, though not perfect, security.

#### Remote Attestation Service (RAS)
- Requires secure data from the manufacturer or telecom provider (hashes of known good code).
- Only early boot code is hashed by the TPM.
- Still relies on traditional antivirus for user-mode protection.
- The data/content provider must trust the RAS.

#### How Does the RAS Trust the Device?
- **TPM → BIOS → Boot Loader → Kernel → Early Drivers**
- Hash of each component is accumulated in a secure location.
- PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) and boot log are sent to the RAS, signed by the TPM.
- **TPM 2.0 Time Counter:**
  - Can be expressed as policy.
  - Reduces the attack surface by limiting token lifetime.

#### Time-Based Authorization
- Secure local time reduces the attack surface.
- Devices use authorization windows to limit token lifetimes.
- Prevents attackers from sleeping the device, changing the clock, and continuing to access data.
- Effective for protecting downloaded data.

#### Mechanics of Secure Time
- See our whitepaper: [Trusted Tamperproof Time on Mobile Devices](http://www.jwsecure.com/dan)
- Applicable to Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Digital Rights Management (DRM).

#### TimedKey.exe Tool
- **Requirements:**
  - 32-bit Windows 8 with TPM 2.0.
- **CLI Commands:**
  ```sh
  C:\>TimedKey.exe
  TimedKey.exe - JW Secure Demo: Policy bound hardware keys
  CREATE   : -c:[1024, 2048] -k:KeyFile {-decrypt -sign -t:60 -p:PIN}
  ENCRYPT  : -e:ClearText -k:KeyFile -o:CipherFile
  DECRYPT  : -d:CipherFile -k:KeyFile {-p:PIN}
  SIGN     : -s:Data -k:KeyFile -o:SignFile {-p:PIN}
  VERIFY   : -v:Data -k:KeyFile -i:SignFile
  ```

#### Policy-Enforced File Access
- **BYOD:**
  - Download sensitive files.
  - Leave the device in a taxi.
- **Threat Model:**
  - Known threats include TPM setup failures on legacy devices, TPM reset attacks, and hardware attacks.
  - Supply chain attacks are also a concern.

#### BitLocker Attacks
- Cold boot, Firewire, and BIOS keyboard attacks.
- Weak PINs can compromise keys in the TPM.
- Incorrectly configured local DLP, such as setting BitLocker to Standby mode.
- Similar considerations apply to other security applications.

#### What Remains to Be Done?
- Develop a database of known-good hashes.
- Create heuristics to determine provisional trust for new code.
- Determine which measurements to enforce and when.
