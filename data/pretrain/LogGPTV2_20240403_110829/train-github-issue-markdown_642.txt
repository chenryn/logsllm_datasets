 **I'm submitting a...**
    [x] bug report 
**Current behavior**  
When using the following...
    styles: [`
      :host-context(body) {
        background: red;
      }
    `]
Angular converts this to...
    [_nghost-ytw-1]body, body [_nghost-ytw-1] {
      background: red;
    }
the problem here is this...
    [_nghost-ytw-1]body
it's causing the whole rule to fail so even `body [_nghost-ytw-1]` will not
receive the red background.
**Expected behavior**  
If angular instead wrote the first selector out like the following swapping
the order of "body" and "[_nghost-ytw-1]"...
    body[_nghost-ytw-1]
the CSS would no longer fail and would be properly applied.
So if, the final CSS looked like this...
    body[_nghost-ytw-1], body [_nghost-ytw-1] {
      background: red;
    }
the issue would be resolved.
