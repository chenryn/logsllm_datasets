It sounds like you're encountering an issue with Jupyter Notebook after following the official installation instructions on both your MacBook Pro (OS X El Capitan) and your web server (Debian 7). The error message "jupyter notebook is not a jupyter command" suggests that the `jupyter` command is not recognizing the `notebook` subcommand, even though the installation process did not report any errors.

Here are some steps to help resolve this issue:

### For macOS (OS X El Capitan):

1. **Check Xcode License Agreement:**
   - Sometimes, the issue can be related to the Xcode Command Line Tools. Ensure that you have agreed to the Xcode license agreement by running:
     ```sh
     sudo xcodebuild -license
     ```
   - After agreeing to the license, try reinstalling Jupyter Notebook:
     ```sh
     sudo pip install --upgrade jupyter
     ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Check if Jupyter Notebook is installed correctly by listing the available Jupyter commands:
     ```sh
     jupyter --version
     ```
   - If Jupyter is installed, it should display the version number. You can also list all available Jupyter subcommands:
     ```sh
     jupyter --help
     ```

3. **Update PATH:**
   - Ensure that the directory where Jupyter is installed is included in your system's PATH. You can add the following line to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:
     ```sh
     export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     ```
   - Then, reload the profile:
     ```sh
     source ~/.bash_profile
     # or
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

### For Debian 7:

1. **Update and Upgrade:**
   - First, ensure your system is up to date:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get upgrade
     ```

2. **Install Python and Pip:**
   - Make sure Python and pip are installed:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install python-pip
     ```

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
     ```sh
     sudo pip install --upgrade jupyter
     ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Check the Jupyter version and available commands as described above:
     ```sh
     jupyter --version
     jupyter --help
     ```

5. **Update PATH:**
   - Ensure the Jupyter executable is in your PATH. Add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:
     ```sh
     export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     ```
   - Reload the profile:
     ```sh
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

### Additional Troubleshooting:

- **Reinstall Jupyter:**
  - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try uninstalling and then reinstalling Jupyter:
    ```sh
    pip uninstall jupyter
    pip install jupyter
    ```

- **Check for Conflicting Packages:**
  - Ensure there are no conflicting packages or multiple versions of Jupyter installed. You can use the following command to check installed packages:
    ```sh
    pip list
    ```
