User: I want to have jupyter notebook installed. But on my MacBook Pro (OS X El Capitan) and my web server (Debian 7), I get the same error: jupyter notebook is not a jupyter command. 
I just follow the official installation instruction. And no error occurs during installation. 
I searched for solutions but none of them works. What should I do now?
Assistant: In my case, it was a matter of agreeing to the Xcode License Agreement with: sudo xcodebuild -license, before running sudo pip install notebook.
