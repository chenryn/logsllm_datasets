The provided system log records the fan speeds of a switch module over a period from October 10, 2005, to November 28, 2005. Each log entry includes a timestamp and the fan speeds of six fans. The log entries show that the fan speeds are generally consistent, with most entries reporting the following speeds: 3552, 3534, 3375, 3515, and 3479. However, there are a few notable variations:

1. **October 12, 2005, at 22:10:45**: The third fan speed was 4530.
2. **October 9, 2005, at 20:10:04**: The third fan speed was 4192.
3. **Starting from November 19, 2005, at 17:24:33**: The third fan speed changed to 3391 and remained consistent in subsequent logs.

Here is a summary of the log chunk:

- **Consistent Fan Speeds**: 3552, 3534, 3515, and 3479.
- **Variations**:
  - **October 12, 2005, 22:10:45**: Third fan speed = 4530.
  - **October 9, 2005, 20:10:04**: Third fan speed = 4192.
  - **From November 19, 2005, 17:24:33 onwards**: Third fan speed = 3391.

This indicates that while the fan speeds are generally stable, there were specific instances where the third fan speed varied, and it eventually stabilized at 3391 on November 19, 2005.
