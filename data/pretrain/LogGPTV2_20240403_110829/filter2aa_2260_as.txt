The Portland UA TICP represents the first formal regionwide interoperable communications SOPs or the 
area.  Prior to the development of the TICP, the UA had informal, undocumented SOPs that were 
incorporated into the TICP.  The UA has taken steps to distribute the interoperable communications SOPs

(e.g., distributing the policies through the TICP Implementation Workshop, including applicable SOPs with 
gateways and radio caches).  In regards to command and control procedures, the Portland UA is in the 
process of implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System 
(ICS), and training is ongoing.  The TICP validation exercise demonstrated some gaps with the 
communications procedures set forth by NIMS/ICS and the communication unit, specifically how the 
communications unit did not precede the unit identifier with agency name, and no name was given to the 
incident. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Document, update, and put into practice regional communications interoperability SOPs, and continue to 
disseminate them throughout the UA 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The Portland UA uses shared systems and shared channels on a daily basis.  Agencies report the regular use 
of gateway systems, which are needed to connect disparate 800 megahertz (MHz) and very high frequency 
(VHF) systems.  The UA demonstrated successful use of each category of interoperable equipment during 
the TICP exercise.  For example, the local and regional first responders were able to communicate with other 
units using a set of shared talk groups and shared channels.  The level of familiarity and frequency of use of 
interoperable communications equipment among local first responders was adequate, but the degree to which 
this proficiency extends to interoperability with state and federal agencies is not identified as such agencies 
were not fully involved in the exercise.  The Portland UA is encouraged to build on this success by further 
incorporating state, federal, and support agencies in its TICP and future exercises.                
Recommendations: 
• 
Involve state and federal agencies in training and exercises 
• 
Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency 
(e.g., radio cache) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Portland UA has a number of shared radio systems operating primarily in the 800 MHz and VHF bands.  
Communication between systems in different bands is established using gateways in conjunction with the national 
mutual aid frequencies. 
The Portland UA is currently planning for 800 MHz re-banding.  In conjunction with the required reprogramming 
associated with the re-banding process, the Portland UA will simultaneously establish common naming conventions for 
talk groups on the regional shared systems.  Some of the shared systems provide overlapping coverage.  Thus, a single 
regional Project 25 shared system is a potential next step for the UA.

The Philadelphia UA communications subcommittee reports to the Southeastern Counter Terrorism Task 
Force and includes local, state, and federal participating agencies (e.g., ports authorities, State Police, U.S. 
Coast Guard).  Based on the provided documentation, it was not noted whether the subcommittee has 
established authorities (through a published charter) or clearly delineated roles and responsibilities.  The UA 
has formal partnerships among the public safety organizations and formal agreements among most of the 
agencies in the UA (specifically the counties in Pennsylvania), which facilitates partnerships and multi-
agency coordination.  However, the formal agreements and partnerships do not yet include all first responder 
agencies from the New Jersey (where individual counties do not have the power to enter into a mutual aid 
agreement and must involve the state government for approval) and Delaware counties included in the 
recently expanded UA.  The Philadelphia UA is developing a strategic plan for interoperable 
communications, but no plan is yet published.  Completing and distributing a plan would aid in solidifying 
interoperability goals that take into account all counties in the designated UA.  Using Urban Area Security 
Initiative funds, the UA develops budgets and procures equipment according to strategic interoperability 
goals; however, it is unclear how sustainable operations and maintenance funding for interoperability 
equipment and solutions will be obtained.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider distributing a formal charter to all participating agencies and continue to meet regularly and 
proactively recruit new participants 
• 
Put into practice agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) and establish processes to develop and 
review agreements at least every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or upgrades   
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the 
Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan [TICP]) with participant approval, adoption, and 
acceptance, that takes into account a long-term communications funding strategy (in addition to grants) 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Identify long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) sustainable funding for communications interoperability in addition 
to grants 
• 
Involve senior government leadership broadly across the UA on interoperability

organizations and participated in the TICP Implementation Workshop to train the participating agencies on 
the SOPs.  Although the UA had existing SOPs and provided training on them, the participants experienced 
some minor procedural problems during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., dropped initial gateway patch, 
activation procedures were not strictly followed).  Despite officially implementing the NIMS/ICS less than 1 
year ago, the exercise evaluators reported that the Philadelphia UA’s agencies demonstrated “textbook 
deployment” of incident command, and the Communications Unit Leader effectively performed his duties 
during the exercise.  Officials within the area indicated that further training to expand NIMS/ICS 
implementation beyond fire services was being established.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Put regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) into practice through regular 
training (e.g., in-service refreshers and basic training courses), exercises, and usage to increase 
proficiency in implementation of these policies (e.g., to correct gateway issues with activation 
procedures)

The Philadelphia UA reports the ability to use communications interoperability solutions well in task force 
situations.  For day-to-day events, however, the TICP validation exercise demonstrated that “some 
participants have not had sufficient practice in the use of the equipment.”  While the interoperable 
communications equipment (e.g., shared systems, shared channels, gateways) was generally effectively 
demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise, the exercise evaluators and the After Action Report 
clearly indicate that some participants were unfamiliar with the interoperable equipment and assets.  A full 
understanding of all agencies’ capability within the UA is hard to gauge given that the TICP validation 
exercise did not include broad participation by agencies within the Philadelphia UA, or counties in Delaware 
in New Jersey due to the expedited timeline for completion and conflict with another regional exercise. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Implement a regular training schedule (e.g., in-service refreshers and basic training courses) and regular 
exercises that put regional communications interoperability equipment into practice to increase 
proficiency 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises across the UA 
and ensure that all jurisdictions within the area are involved in such events

The Philadelphia UA operates 19 separate communications systems, including very high frequency, ultra high 
frequency, 500 megahertz (MHz), and 800 MHz conventional and trunked systems to support various public safety 
agencies.  The City of Philadelphia operates an 800 MHz, Motorola SmartZone™ system.  Limited interoperability is 
provided using gateways, radio caches, and shared channels.  The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority 
operates a SyTech Radio Inter-Operability System (RIOS) gateway, which it allows county and city agencies access 
upon request to improve interoperability among regional responders.  The mid-term strategy for the UA is to implement 
a microwave communication system and voice radio network that will provide secure communications links between 11 
county dispatch and 11 Emergency Operations Centers in the UA.

The governance structure developed by the Pittsburgh UA can serve as a model for other jurisdictions.  It is 
based on 8 years of success in working regionally across a complex mix of jurisdictions to develop published 
and active mutual aid agreements and communications interoperability solutions (e.g., Southwestern 
Pennsylvania Emergency Response Group).  The Pittsburgh UA leadership is a model for other UAs that 
include a large number of jurisdictions.  The UA has an existing plan for strategic and operational 
interoperable communications efforts.  However, no regular review process for the strategic plan has been 
established.  Public safety agencies in the Pittsburgh UA develop budgets based on strategic goals of the area 
and work to ensure that equipment purchases are compatible.  However, there is no regional solution for 
recurring and lifecycle costs because grants are the main source of funding.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Identify a regular (i.e., annual) review cycle to update regional strategic plan 
• 
Encourage regional interoperability funding strategy, including long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding

The Pittsburgh UA Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) is built on existing formal and 
informal policies and procedures for interoperable communications that have been in place for a number of 
years.  In general, the UA demonstrated some success in the use of SOPs during the TICP validation 
exercise, but a few gaps were displayed (e.g., unit identifiers not correctly used, problems with fixed and 
mobile gateways) that highlight minor weaknesses in the application of the SOPs.  The UA is currently 
addressing these issues and plans to finish documenting and disseminating updated SOPs to all agencies by 
March 2007.  Although the Pittsburgh UA first responders have not yet fully implemented the National 
Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), they are making excellent progress 
toward developing and disseminating NIMS-compliant SOPs.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider regularly exercising SOPs that test the UA’s proficiency (e.g., document shared channels), and 
distribute updated plans to all included organizations   
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

Currently, there is adequate communications interoperability within each of the 13 counties, but limited 
interoperability among the 13 counties and the State of Pennsylvania.  During the TICP validation exercise, 
Pittsburgh demonstrated the ability to regularly and successfully use existing interoperability equipment and 
showed proficiency and familiarity with some communications equipment including radio caches and shared 
channels.  However, during the TICP validation exercise, users displayed some difficulty in using specific 
interoperability solutions (e.g., deactivation procedure for gateways).  For example, the TICP validation 
exercise exposed some problems with patching the Westmoreland County public safety agencies (e.g., police 
department, fire department) 800 megahertz (MHz) system to a channel used by the incident command.  
Assessing the degree to which the local agencies in the UA can easily use interoperable communications 
equipment with state and federal agencies was not possible.  While the exercise met the stated requirements, 
the area is encouraged to build on its success by further integrating state, federal, tribal, and support agencies 
in future tests.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to train and exercise on available technology (e.g., gateway solutions) to improve familiarity of 
use, and work toward seamless integration of interoperable communications solutions 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises to continue to 
build awareness of and fluency with communications interoperability resources

The Pittsburgh UA, Pennsylvania Region 13, has 102 shared systems. The 13 counties have various systems including 
ultra high frequency (UHF), very high frequency (VHF), 800 MHz Motorola trunked systems, and 700 MHz systems.  
Currently, there is adequate communications interoperability within each of the 13 counties, but limited interoperability 
among the 13 counties and the State of Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania has a statewide 800 MHz system and a M/A-COM 
Open Sky™ System that is shared with the 13 counties in the UA.  The UA uses shared channels, gateways,  (15 
mobile, 4 fixed), and console patches (not gateways). 
Thirty-four agencies have radio caches, including 800 MHz, dual band 700 MHz and 800 MHz, UHF, and VHF High 
Band radios, for a total of around 583 cache radios.  The Pittsburg UA is planning to use shared channels, gateways, and 
radio caches to improve communications interoperability among 1,400 agencies spread out over 1,200 square miles.  
There are no additional technology initiatives planned for improving communications interoperability at this time.

Through the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCT COG) structure, a regional communications 
committee has taken key steps on communications interoperability issues since its formation in October 
2005.  One key step has been the creation of a Regional Interoperable Communications Agreement that was 
recently approved by the communications committee.  Dallas/Fort Worth officials indicated that they had 
come together to pursue regional funding; however, their communications interoperability priorities appear 
to be driven by available grants rather than a long-term funding strategy that would take into account 
diversified and sustainable funding sources.  This is an issue that the area is currently addressing.  With 
almost 300 agencies involved in interoperability efforts, it was difficult to determine whether the UA had 
coordinated all necessary published and active regional agreements to include all public safety organizations.  
Most Dallas/Fort Worth UA organizations have memoranda of understanding (MOU) in place with the state, 
and with federal agencies (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation).  Dallas/Fort Worth has also faced the 
challenge of getting all participating organizations to adopt a regional interoperability strategic plan (beyond 
the operational focus of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan [TICP]) because of the large 
number of agencies.  Given the large number of agencies that are included in the Dallas/Fort Worth UA, 
challenges exist for identifying and including all of the necessary agencies in interoperable communications 
activities (e.g., formalizing all partnerships in agreements, gaining acceptance on interoperable 
communications plans).   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to develop published and active agreements (e.g., MOUs) to facilitate interoperability with all 
public safety organizations within the UA 
• 
Develop a regional strategic plan for communications interoperability and obtain acceptance from all 
participants 
• 
Encourage the development of a regional interoperability funding strategy, including sustainable (e.g., 3 
to 5 years) funding sources (in addition to grants) that address long-term communications 
interoperability needs 
• 
Establish, as a priority across the UA, regional interoperability procedures and associated training that 
are accepted by leadership

The Dallas/Fort Worth UA TICP represents the first formal interoperable communications regional SOPs for 
the area.  Prior to the development of the TICP, the UA had informal SOPs to facilitate regionwide 
communications interoperability; these distinct SOPs were combined in the TICP.  However, as noted in the
