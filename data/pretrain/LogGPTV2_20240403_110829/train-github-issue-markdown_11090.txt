# Environment
    Windows build number: 18363.836 (ver in PowerShell returned an error)
    PowerToys version: 0.18.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
  1. maximize a window
  2. press win+left/right arrow
# Expected behaviour
Recently updated to v0.18.1 from ~v0.15ish. In previous versions, a maximised
screen could snap to a zone simply by pressing win+left/right arrow.
# Actual behaviour
In v0.18.1 I first need to press win+down to minimise the screen and then
position it with win+left/right.
# Questions
Not sure if this is an issue or just the new way it's working. Is this the
desired behaviour?
