# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
Latest webpack (4.29.4) pulls in `long@4.0.1` using Git.
long is still on 4.0.0, so 4.0.1 hasn't been published yet. This mean it is
doing so via `git`, which creates a hard dependency on `git` for projects
bundled with webpack. This creates issues w/CI pipelines that do not use
`git`.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
Simply install webpack with yarn/npm and inspect the lock files, and you
should see something like:
    long "git://github.com/dcodeIO/long.js.git#8181a6b50a2a230f0b2a1e4c4093f9b9d19c8b69"
**What is the expected behavior?**
Webpack itself should not have a dependency on `git`. This is an unnecessary
dependency for CI/build systems.
