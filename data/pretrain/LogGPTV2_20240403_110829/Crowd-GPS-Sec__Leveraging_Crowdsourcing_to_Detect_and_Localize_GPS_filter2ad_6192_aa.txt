Abstract—The aviation industry’s increasing reliance on GPS
to facilitate navigation and air trafﬁc monitoring opens new
attack vectors with the purpose of hijacking UAVs or interfering
with air safety. We propose Crowd-GPS-Sec to detect and
localize GPS spooﬁng attacks on moving airborne targets such
as UAVs or commercial airliners. Unlike previous attempts to
secure GPS, Crowd-GPS-Sec neither requires any updates of
the GPS infrastructure nor of
the airborne GPS receivers,
which are both unlikely to happen in the near future. In
contrast, Crowd-GPS-Sec leverages crowdsourcing to monitor
the air trafﬁc from GPS-derived position advertisements that
aircraft periodically broadcast for air trafﬁc control purposes.
Spooﬁng attacks are detected and localized by an independent
infrastructure on the ground which continuously analyzes the
contents and the times of arrival of these advertisements. We
evaluate our system with real-world data from a crowdsourced
air trafﬁc monitoring sensor network and by simulations. We
show that Crowd-GPS-Sec is able to globally detect GPS spooﬁng
attacks in less than two seconds and to localize the attacker up to
an accuracy of 150 meters after 15 minutes of monitoring time.
I. INTRODUCTION
Today, more than a billion devices rely on the Global
Positioning System (GPS) for various applications that re-
quire accurate positioning or precise time synchronization.
With its ubiquitous coverage, GPS has become the de facto
standard means of navigation and tracking services in outdoor
environments, where it achieves an accuracy of up to three
meters [1]. For navigation purposes, satellite systems such
as GPS are mission-critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), ranging from consumer-class mini or micro drones
to tactical and strategic UAVs.
Although GPS is commonly used in aviation, the system
is not secure,
i. e., civilian (public) GPS signals sent by
the satellites are neither authenticated nor encrypted. As a
consequence, aircraft and UAVs are vulnerable to GPS signal
spooﬁng attacks, where a malicious transmitter emits signals
similar to those from the satellites but at a higher power and,
potentially, at slightly different time delays. The aircraft’s GPS
receiver will lock on to the spoofed signal as it arrives with a
higher signal strength than the authentic signals.
By selectively varying the time offsets of the spoofed
satellite signals, attackers are able to mimic arbitrary positions.
These kinds of spooﬁng attacks are well-known [2]–[7] and
have been shown to be feasible in the real-world [5], [8]. In
fact, GPS spooﬁng has allegedly been used to hijack a CIA
stealth drone (RQ-170) in Iran in 2011 [9] or luring ships
off their course [4], [10]. Moreover, GPS spooﬁng has been
used as a defense against GPS-controlled UAVs ﬂying in the
vicinity of the Kremlin in Russia [11].
Over the years, the price to perform GPS spooﬁng attacks
has dramatically dropped. Mobile commercial off-the-shelf
GPS spooﬁng devices are available for less than $1,000 [4]
and publicly available software tools [12] allow the generation
of arbitrary GPS signals. The price fall and low-expertise
requirements raise the risk for applications relying on GPS
for safety- or security-critical decisions and processes.
The democratization of GPS spooﬁng technologies has trig-
gered the development of various countermeasures, which can
be coarsely categorized into three classes: (i) cryptographic
techniques, (ii) detection at signal level, and (iii) direction
of arrival sensing. Cryptographic techniques [13]–[16] aim at
authenticating signals from satellites with additional signals
that are unpredictable to users that do not own a secret
key. However, these techniques are not resistant to replay
attacks and would require a costly upgrade of the GPS infras-
tructure. Spooﬁng detection at signal level are based either
on anomaly checks in the physical signal waveform [17]–
[19] or on measuring the angle of arrival from which the
signal is originating [20], [21]. While these techniques do
not require a change in the structure of GPS signals, they
impose modiﬁcations on existing receivers and increase the
complexity and computational requirements of those devices.
We conclude that existing countermeasures are unlikely to
be implemented in the near future since they all require far-
reaching modiﬁcations of either the GPS infrastructure or the
receiving devices.
Driven by the increasing threat and the lack of realistic
short-term solutions, we propose Crowd-GPS-Sec, a system
that detects and localizes GPS spooﬁng attacks on aerial
vehicles without
the need to update the structure of the
GPS satellites’ signals nor the logic of the airborne GPS re-
ceivers. Crowd-GPS-Sec leverages crowdsourcing to monitor
the position advertisements derived from GPS that aircraft and
UAVs periodically broadcast for air trafﬁc surveillance. Using

those advertisements, we devise a GPS spooﬁng detection and
localization solution that analyzes the contents and the time of
arrival of these surveillance messages as received by different
sensors on the ground.
We have evaluated Crowd-GPS-Sec with simulations and
real-world data from the OpenSky Network [22], a crowd-
sourcing initiative which maintains a network of more than
700 air trafﬁc communication sensors around the world. Our
implementation of Crowd-GPS-Sec is able to globally detect
GPS spooﬁng attacks in less than two seconds and to localize
the attacker up to an accuracy of 150 meters after 15 minutes
of monitoring time.
While the problem addressed in this work is related to
spooﬁng detection and localization in classical direction ﬁnd-
ing [20], [21] and multilateration systems [23], there is one
fundamental difference and unique advantage. Instead of try-
ing to detect and localize the GPS spoofer through direct
measurements of its own signals, we rely on indirect mea-
surements from the position advertisements that the aircraft
are broadcasting. This approach enables us to detect and
localize the spoofer even when there is no direct line-of-
sight connection from a sensor to the spoofer. Maintaining
a line-of-sight connection to the aircraft
is much simpler
and thus more effective since the aircraft are in the sky and
use high transmission power levels which render the signals
receivable from the ground up to several hundred kilometers
away. Another major advantage is that Crowd-GPS-Sec relies
on data from air trafﬁc monitoring sensors that are already
widely deployed around the world. Thus, the solution does
not require a dedicated GPS signal acquisition infrastructure
for spooﬁng detection and localization. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to propose a GPS spooﬁng
countermeasure which takes advantage of considering indirect
GPS-inferred data rather than raw GPS signals.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
• We propose Crowd-GPS-Sec and elaborate on the idea to
provide security via an existing infrastructure of crowd-
sourcing sensors.
• We present algorithms for the detection of GPS spooﬁng
attacks on airborne targets by using aircraft reports and
multilateration.
• We provide a novel technique for the localization of GPS
spoofers based on position differences between pairs of
spoofed aircraft.
• We report on experiments with aircraft transponders and
assess the performance of Crowd-GPS-Sec analyzing
real-world air trafﬁc control data.
II. THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
The GPS infrastructure is a satellite-based navigation net-
work of over 30 satellites located in the medium Earth orbit,
more than 20,000 km above the Earth’s surface. GPS-capable
receivers can determine their position and time by measuring
the time of arrival (ToA) from at least four satellites. Based
on the ToA and the transmission time embedded in the
signals, receivers can calculate distances to each satellite.

Multilateration of those distances yields the position and the
local time of the receiver.
The ToA measurements are affected by a range of errors
resulting in a typical localization uncertainty of σ = 4 m
(mean error of about 7 m) [24]–[27]. While civilian (public)
GPS signals can be decoded by everyone, including airplanes,
drones, and other UAVs, military GPS signals are protected
by (at
least) secret spreading codes restricting their users
to a selected group with additional knowledge. We focus
on civilian GPS with non-authenticated signals, which is the
standard in commercial and general aviation.
A. GPS Usage in Aviation
While in the past, radar and inertial systems used to be the
two main localization technologies in aviation, GPS is today
often the preferred solution due to its superior accuracy. Mod-
ern airliners, smaller aircraft, gliders, helicopters, or UAVs
are almost all equipped with GPS receivers. GPS is typically
used by pilots or UAVs for self-localization but the technology
is also used for remote air-trafﬁc surveillance and collision-
avoidance applications. In the latter cases, aerial vehicles are
required to periodically broadcast position and velocity adver-
tisements to inform neighboring aircraft and ground controllers
about their presence. Larger aerial vehicles generally transmit
those messages over the Automatic Dependent Surveillance –
Broadcast (ADS-B) system while smaller and slower vehicles
rely on the Flarm [28] system. Irrespective of the used system,
these advertisements contain a position that is directly derived
from airborne GPS receivers as depicted in Figure 1.
In this work, we propose to leverage the position advertise-
ment messages of ADS-B and Flarm in order to detect and lo-
calize GPS spoofers. While ADS-B and Flarm rely on different
radio frequencies and message formats, the underlying concept
is the same. On regular random intervals (around twice per
second), aircraft broadcast their current position together with
their unique addresses. Neighboring aerial vehicles and ground
stations receive these messages to generate a recognized air
picture. The advertisement messages can be received over long
distances. In ADS-B, messages can be received up to distances

line-of-sight connection
of 700 km when there is a direct
between the transmitter and the receiver. In Flarm, the range
is smaller but reception ranges of up to 100 km are possible.
B. GPS Spooﬁng Attacks
GPS spooﬁng attacks exploit the lack of encryption and
authentication of civilian GPS signals by imitating the legit-
imate signals with the purpose of modifying the localization
or time result of a victim [3], [7], [25]. Technically, spooﬁng
attacks are based on fake GPS signals manipulating the ToAs
of signals that otherwise use the same payload as real signals.
In the past, incidents were reported [4], [9]–[11] where
spoofers successfully interfered with the integrity of GPS-
dependent systems,
thus rendering the spooﬁng threat far
from being only of theoretical nature. As a result, currently
marketed drones, aircraft, helicopters, or any kind of vehicles
that rely on GPS are prone to spooﬁng attacks and lack
effective countermeasures.
Based on common assumptions on attacker capabilities and
recent incidents, we assess the resulting threat model in this
section. First, we clarify our considered adversary model. Sec-
ond, we reason about key assumptions that Crowd-GPS-Sec
is based on to detect and localize spooﬁng attacks.
1) Threat Model: The attacker’s motivation to interfere
with the air safety by injecting false positioning information
into UAVs or aircraft can be manifold. An attacker may
consider hijacking the targeted victim for an own beneﬁt of
acquiring goods or circumventing ﬂying bans. Even more
severe, an attacker may participate in terrorist attacks by
manipulating the air-trafﬁc control or the collision-avoidance
systems, e. g., by spooﬁng fake position information to fool
the safety logic of these systems.
In our adversary model, the attacker is able to transmit
specially crafted signals identical
to those broadcasted by
GPS satellites but can achieve a higher power at the target
location. The attacker aims at spooﬁng a moving aircraft or
a UAV from a position on the ground. In order to conduct a
stealthy and unnoticed attack, the spoofer may use a directional
antenna1 directed towards the victim in the sky. However, due
to the target’s movement, the attacker needs to transmit signals
from a considerable distance, hundreds of meters to kilometers
away. We note that typical operating altitudes of UAVs range
from 60 m to 20,000 m and their mission radii vary from 5 km
to 200 km and beyond [30]. Hence, if the route taken by the
victim is not predictable, the attacker will be forced to use
antennas with wide-beam propagation patterns. This forces the
attacker to transmit signals of such a strength and propagation
that the spooﬁng signals most likely will not only be received
at a particular primary target location but also over a wider
area, affecting other aircraft and UAVs in the neighborhood.
Since the spoofer is targeting moving vehicles, we further
assume that the spoofer is emulating a moving track such as
a straight line or a curve with some potential acceleration.
1We focus on the common assumption that the attacker uses a single antenna
for transmitting the spooﬁng signals, but the proposed technique could also
be extended to multi-antenna attackers representing an emerging threat [29].

have an integrated GPS receiver but do not provide any protection to GPS
spooﬁng and advertise false positions when spoofed.
2) Validation of Assumptions: Crowd-GPS-Sec relies on
two key assumptions which we validate in this section. The
ﬁrst assumption is that whenever a GPS receiver locks on
to the spoofed signals,
the position advertisements of the
aircraft and UAVs will contain the spoofed GPS positions.
While commercial GPS receivers are known to be vulnera-
ble to spooﬁng attacks [2]–[5], [8], [10], [31]–[33], aviation
transponders could have additional plausibility checks to pre-
vent that spoofed GPS positions propagate to the broadcasted
position advertisements. The second assumption is that the
spoofed signals will not only affect the target victim of the
spoofer but also neighboring aircraft and UAVs. We validate
these two assumptions with controlled lab experiments and
simulations with real-world air trafﬁc data from the OpenSky
Network.
GPS Spooﬁng Experiments. We perform GPS spooﬁng
experiments with two Flarm transponders that are widely
deployed. As we could not get formal approval from our
national ofﬁce of communications to perform GPS spooﬁng
experiments in the wild with real aircraft, we rely on an
isolated experimental setup inside a shielded lab environment.
The goal of these experiments is to demonstrate that existing
transponders do not perform any checks on the derived GPS
position and that spoofers can precisely control the position
and speed of victim receivers.
Our experimental setup consists of two new-generation
Flarm transponder models from Flarm Technology: a Pow-
erFLARM Core and a PowerFLARM Portable both with an
integrated GPS receiver from u-blox, see Figure 2. More than
30,000 manned aircraft, helicopters, and UAVs over the world
are equipped today with these transponders [28]. As GPS
spoofer, we rely on a USRP B200 from Ettus Research and
the software-deﬁned GPS signal simulator gps-sdr-sim [12].
To monitor the reported Flarm position advertisements by
the transponders, we use a Raspberry Pi with an RTL-SDR
software-deﬁned radio dongle and the ﬂare open-source Flarm
decoder [34]. All devices are equipped with omnidirectional
antennas.
