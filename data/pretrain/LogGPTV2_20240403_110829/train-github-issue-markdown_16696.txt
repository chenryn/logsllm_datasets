**Chapman** opened **SPR-9454** and commented
Spring version 3.1.0.RELEASE.
A page display 2 dropdown boxes, each of them contained over 100 values. There
are two problems:
  1. Render JSP is slow, over 2 seconds to display a simple page.
  2. After running for a few days, the response time is slower, over 5 seconds to display the same page.
Verify GC log in Tomcat, there is no memory leak.  
Is there any problem in OptionTag.renderOption method?
From other forumn, it also mentioned form:select has performance issue.
