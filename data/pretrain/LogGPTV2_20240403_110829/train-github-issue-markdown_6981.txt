Subject: Issue with Axios v1.1 - Please Revert to Previous Version

Hi Team,

We have encountered an issue with the latest version of Axios (v1.1). Specifically, the `axios.get` and `axios.post` methods are not functioning as expected.

To resolve this problem, please revert to the previous version of Axios until a fix is available.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
