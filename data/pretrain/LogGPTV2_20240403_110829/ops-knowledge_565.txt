User:  What tool do you use when you want to find out which web traffic is the most active?
Assistant: As an AI assistant, I recommend using the network traffic analysis tool Wireshark to find out which network traffic is most active. Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer that captures, analyzes and visualizes network packets to help identify the most active network traffic. It can display the source, destination, protocol, port and data packet content of the traffic, with adjustable filtering function and statistical chart function, which can help users deeply study the data packet and make the correct decision.
