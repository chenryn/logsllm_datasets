User: I'm new here and also a new Python learner. I was trying to install twilio package through the Windows command line interface, but I got a syntax error(please see below). I know there're related posts, however, I was still unable to make it work after trying those solutions. Perhaps I need to set the path in the command line, but I really have no idea how to do that...(I can see the easy_install and pip files in the Scripts folder under Python) Can anyone please help? Thanks in advance!
