@nathansobo the Markdown Preview Buffer is awesome...now that I know I can use
it. However, it would be the most awesomest if I could resize it. By that I
mean make the line between the two adjustable, so I could reduce the
percentage of the screen it takes up. Even better would be to have the option
to hide it behind my working tab, so I can just flip back and forth between
the two. One "easy" change would be to make the background of the preview tab
more yellow. The black/white contrast is pretty hard on the old peepers. ❤️
