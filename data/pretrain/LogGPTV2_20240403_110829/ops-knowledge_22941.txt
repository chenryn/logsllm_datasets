User: How to identify hosts in the network and analyze their vulnerabilities through network scanning tools?
Assistant: 1. Confirm the network range: First, you need to understand the network range, that is, which hosts are in the same network. 2. Select a network scanning tool: Select an appropriate network scanning tool, such as Nmap, Metasploit, Acunetix, etc. 3. Scan the host: Use the scanning tool to scan the target network, and record the host IP address, host name, open service and port, and operating system type in the network. 4. Analyze the scan results: analyze the scan results and determine the vulnerabilities in the network, such as unauthorized access, weak passwords, system vulnerabilities, etc. 5. Formulate a vulnerability repair plan: According to the level and scope of the vulnerability, formulate a corresponding vulnerability repair plan and carry out the repair work. 6. Continuous monitoring and testing: Regularly scan and test the network to ensure the security of the network. At the same time, access control and security configuration should be strengthened to improve network security.
