Common commands include: 1. tail: It is used to display the end content of the log file, and you can view the latest log information in real time. 2. cat: used to display all or part of the contents of the log file. 3. grep: Used to find log information that meets certain conditions. 4. less: similar to cat, but can realize page turning, search and other functions. Log analysis can be done through the following steps: 1. Know the format and content of the log, and determine the key information that needs to be analyzed. 2. Use command-line tools to screen and filter to find key log information. 3. Further analyze the log information, determine the cause of the error and take solutions. It should be noted that the content of log records is various and it is difficult to analyze. Therefore, extensive experience and skills are required when troubleshooting. At the same time, some automated tools can also be used for large-scale log analysis and anomaly detection.
