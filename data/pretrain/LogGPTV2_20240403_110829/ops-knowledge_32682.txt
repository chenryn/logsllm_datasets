Question: "Why might an SoC vendor prefer updating SELinux policy in Android 8.0 and higher as opposed to earlier versions of the operating system?"
 "A": "Earlier versions of Android required modifications to `boot.img` or `system.img`, making updates more cumbersome than the separate platform and vendor policy builds in later versions."
 "B": "Android 8.0 and higher do not support SELinux, thus simplifying the update process for SoC vendors."
 "C": "In Android 8.0 and higher, the `init` process no longer needs to load SELinux policies, eliminating the need for SoC vendors to modify these policies."
 "D": "The monolithic sepolicy files in the root directory of earlier Android versions were simpler to update compared to the modularized SELinux policy files in later versions."
Answer: A
