User: How to optimize the performance of web applications, including data query, page rendering, resource caching, etc.?
Assistant: Here are some ways to optimize the performance of web applications: 1. Database query optimization: Use indexes, avoid full table scans, cache common query results, etc. to improve query efficiency. 2. Page rendering optimization: Use progressive enhancement to design pages, use CDN acceleration, streamline and merge CSS and JS files, and delay loading images to improve page loading speed. 3. Resource cache optimization: Use caching technology to reduce the number of network requests, use long-term caching to reduce resource loading time, and use compression technology to reduce resource transmission size to improve resource loading efficiency. 4. Code optimization: Avoid using complex recursive algorithms or loop nesting, use asynchronous loading and coroutines to improve code concurrency, and avoid using too many global variables to improve code execution efficiency. 5. Server optimization: Configure appropriate server hardware and software environment, use load balancing and clustering technologies to improve concurrent processing capabilities, use compression technology and caching technology to reduce the number of network requests, etc. to improve server performance. 6. Code optimization tools: use code optimization tools such as JProfiler, VisualVM, etc. to optimize the performance of web applications.
