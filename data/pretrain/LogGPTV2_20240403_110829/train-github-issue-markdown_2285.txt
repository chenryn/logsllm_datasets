When you choose to customise bootstrap before downloading it from here:  
http://getbootstrap.com/customize/
The complied CSS for both bootstrap.css and bootstrap.min.css is WRONG.
The CSS declaration for the .fade.in opacity is placed at the bottom on each
CSS script, meaning when you open the Modal this element:
Takes on this CSS :  
.fade.in {  
opacity: 1;  
}
Instead of what it is supposed to be:
.modal-backdrop.in {  
opacity: 0.5;  
filter: alpha(opacity=50);  
}
This is because the .fade.in declaration is below the modal-backdrop CSS.
With the normal bootstrap complied download (meaning non-customised version)
is fine, and works as expected. Just not the custom one.
