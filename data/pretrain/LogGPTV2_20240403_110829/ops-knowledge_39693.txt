User: Please explain what is load balancing? How to achieve load balancing in enterprise applications?
Assistant: Load balancing is a technology that distributes client requests to multiple servers or computing resources by rationally allocating network service requests to achieve optimal resource utilization, minimize response time, and avoid single point of failure. In enterprise-level applications, the following methods can be used to achieve load balancing: 1. Hardware load balancer: to achieve load balancing through dedicated hardware devices, which can provide higher performance and better reliability. 2. Software load balancer: load balancing is achieved through software applications, which can be freely customized and easy to maintain, but may not be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests. 3. DNS load balancing: By setting multiple IP addresses in DNS records, let the domain name resolver randomly select an available IP address to achieve load balancing. 4. Load balancing based on reverse proxy: By setting up a reverse proxy server, forwarding customer requests to multiple back-end servers to achieve load balancing. Regardless of the method used, load balancing in enterprise-level applications should take into account factors such as application scenarios, service scale, performance requirements, and reliability to ensure the stability and high availability of enterprise application systems.
