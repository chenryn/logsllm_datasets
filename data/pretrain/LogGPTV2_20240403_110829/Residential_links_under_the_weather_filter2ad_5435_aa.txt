## Abstract
Weather is a leading threat to the stability of critical infrastructure, and last-mile Internet connections are no exception. However, the impact of weather on residential Internet outages remains poorly understood. This study is the first to quantify the effect of weather on residential Internet outages. We address the challenges posed by the heterogeneity of residential Internet (various media types, protocols, and providers) by conducting a large-scale analysis of eight years of active outage measurements across the majority of the last-mile Internet infrastructure in the United States.

## 1. Introduction
"Severe weather is the number one cause of power outages in the United States and costs the economy billions of dollars a year in lost output and wages, spoiled inventory, delayed production, inconvenience, and damage to grid infrastructure."
— President’s Council of Economic Advisers, "Economic Benefits of Increasing Electric Grid Reliability to Weather Outages", 2013

This quote underscores the significant economic impact of weather-related damage to critical infrastructure. However, the impact of weather-induced outages on residential last-mile Internet links, which are the most pervasive form of Internet access, is not well understood. U.S. policy requires telecommunications companies to report outages to the FCC, but the reporting threshold is high: outages must last at least 30 minutes and affect tens of thousands of customers. Previous research has focused on widespread Internet failures, such as undersea cable cuts, natural disasters, and backbone router failures.

In practice, most weather events are localized and not severe enough to cause such large-scale outages. For decades, it has been known that everyday weather can lead to smaller outages in telecom infrastructure. For example, early engineering documents describe how moisture in wires can impede signal propagation, and rain can attenuate satellite signals above 10 GHz. Additionally, point-to-point wireless links can experience multipath fading due to wind. Residential links are particularly vulnerable to everyday weather because equipment and wiring are often installed outdoors, where they can be affected by wind, heat, and rain.

Surprisingly, there are no public statistics on the frequency or magnitude of outages caused by everyday weather. Such information could help Internet-based companies estimate customer losses and assist regulators in identifying areas that need attention. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive study that identifies the correlation between everyday weather and residential Internet outages. Specifically, we quantify the increase in the number and duration of outages during weather events compared to non-weather periods.

The correlation between weather and outages cannot be determined with a short-term study. Weather is seasonal, and some conditions occur only at certain times of the year. Some weather events are also rare, making them particularly interesting. Targeted probing is necessary because weather is localized, affecting specific locations at any given time. Broad observation of outages across multiple links can capture correlated outages, but it will not reveal failures of individual links. Although some systems can obtain detailed measurements at residential gateways, their limited deployment makes them inadequate for large-scale studies. Therefore, we conducted an eight-year longitudinal study with targeted measurements of residential hosts exposed to weather events.

In 2011, we introduced a measurement system called ThunderPing, which follows weather forecasts and pings a sample of 100 hosts from each last-mile provider in the area for six hours before, during, and after the forecasted weather event. The initial paper on ThunderPing focused on its probing methodology and included a preliminary study with 66 days of data. Given the limited dataset, we could not draw statistically significant conclusions, especially for rare link types or rural locations. With only one summer of data, we observed only a small subset of possible conditions.

This paper analyzes 1,811 days of data across eight years, capturing a wide range of seasonal and regional weather conditions. This large dataset enabled us to address the limitations of our preliminary study.

Quantifying the correlation between weather and outages is challenging because outages are relatively uncommon, and every outage is a significant event. This is compounded by the fact that we wish to analyze subsets of our data, such as specific link types or locations. To address this issue, we apply hazard rate estimation from epidemiology to quantify and establish statistical significance for the increase in outage probability, even though failures happen infrequently. We detail this approach in Section 3.1, as we believe it to be of general use to the community.

Another challenge is that this metric could be artificially inflated by weather conditions coinciding with network state changes, such as maintenance or renumbering. Such events would also result in previously responsive IP addresses becoming unresponsive, resulting in what we term a dropout event. Dropouts are therefore supersets of failures (including those due to planned maintenance) and IP address renumbering. We verify that weather does not appear to be positively correlated with peak diurnal dropout periods, and for recovery time analysis, we select dropout durations unlikely to suffer from address renumbering, ensuring that we are probing the same residential link before and after the outage.

We present a dataset spanning eight years, all weather conditions, and 101 billion responsive pings to 10.8 million addresses throughout the U.S. We apply techniques from epidemiology to attribute statistically significant dropout rates to individual weather conditions. Our key findings span five broad areas of analysis:

1. **Failure Rates Increase During Weather (§4.1):** Most weather conditions are accompanied by a statistically significant increase in the probability of failure, including routine weather events such as light rain and snow. Hail, thunderstorms, gale-force winds, heavy rain, and tornadoes are particularly damaging, resulting in increases in failure rates of up to one additional failure per 30 hours.
2. **Link Type Variations (Various):** Different link types experience weather in highly varying ways. For example, wireless link types (WISPs and satellite) experience orders of magnitude greater increases in failure rates than their wired counterparts (cable, DSL, fiber) during rainy conditions.
3. **Geographic Variations (§4.2):** Different geographic regions are affected to varying degrees. For instance, Midwestern U.S. states are more prone to failures in thunderstorms and rain than coastal states. Southern states are the most prone to failures in snow.
4. **Continuous Variable Analysis (§4.3):** Most link types have highly nonlinear failure rates with respect to changes in wind speed and precipitation. Wired links experience significantly larger inflations in failure rates when there is more than an inch of precipitation. On the other hand, the mere presence of precipitation results in statistically significant increases in failure rates for satellite links.
5. **Recovery Times (§5):** Wired links can experience a two-fold increase in recovery time during some weather conditions. Wireless link types’ recovery durations are less strongly correlated with weather and are often shorter during weather conditions.

Our findings have implications for how network outage detection and analysis should be performed. Limiting measurements to any particular geographic region, link type, or time of year can introduce statistically significant bias. We believe our results also have implications for network administrators and policymakers. The increased use of wireless links in rural areas, such as through the $2 billion Connect America Fund, has resulted in many short failures during weather. In this work, we studied the frequency and severity of weather-induced failures on last-mile Internet. However, our dataset allows for the investigation of other issues, including determining the root causes of weather-related outages. To this end, we have made our analyses of the ThunderPing dataset publicly available at: https://thunderping.cs.umd.edu

## 2. Measurement Methodology and Datasets
To perform our study, we use ThunderPing, a measurement infrastructure we developed to actively probe hosts within a weather event. In this section, we describe the features of ThunderPing relevant to this paper: when, where, whom, and how ThunderPing probes, as well as the datasets it uses in making these decisions. We also describe how we determine when there are "dropouts": transitions in responsiveness to pings indicative of a failure. Finally, we summarize the dataset ThunderPing has constructed through eight years of active measurement.

### 2.1 Data Collection Methodology
The primary goal of ThunderPing is to measure the responsiveness of hosts before, during, and after weather events. Unlike other active probing techniques that involve scanning virtually all networks at regular intervals, ThunderPing takes a more focused approach, probing hosts in regions where weather events are likely. Here, we explain how ThunderPing performs its probing precisely where and when it is needed.

**When and Where ThunderPing Probes:**
The U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) provides real-time "severe weather alert" forecasts. Each forecast includes metadata, but the critical information for this study is the predicted start and end times (s and t) and the affected regions, specified by FIPS code (which roughly corresponds to a U.S. county). These are predictions of future weather events. ThunderPing uses them as a best-effort guide of where and when to probe, and then follows up with ground-truth data of observed weather conditions.

ThunderPing probes during the interval [s-6, t+6]: up to six hours before the predicted start and six hours after the predicted end. This serves two purposes: it insulates against NWS prediction errors and extends data collection to capture dropouts and their recovery times.

**Whom ThunderPing Probes:**
In this study, we seek to understand how weather affects different residential providers and link types. ThunderPing probes a sample of 100 hosts from each last-mile provider in the affected region. The table below summarizes the number of IPs, airports, and states probed, along with the total dropout and responsive hours.

| Link Type | Provider | IPs | Airports | States | Dropout Hours | Responsive Hours |
|-----------|----------|-----|----------|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Cable     | Comcast  | 709,386 | 354,542 | 202,616 | 70,284 | 874,623 |
