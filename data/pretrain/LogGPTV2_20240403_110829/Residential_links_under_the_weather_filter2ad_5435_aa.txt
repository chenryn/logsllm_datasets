ABSTRACT
Weather is a leading threat to the stability of our vital infrastructure.
Last-mile Internet is no exception. Yet, unlike other vital infras-
tructure, weather’s effect on last-mile Internet outages is not well
understood. This work is the first attempt to quantify the effect of
weather on residential outages.
Investigating outages in residential networks due to weather is
challenging because residential Internet is heterogeneous: there are
different media types, different protocols, and different providers,
in varying contexts of different local climate and geography. Sen-
sitivity to these different factors leads to narrow categories when
estimating how weather affects these different links. To address
these issues we perform a large-scale study looking at eight years
of active outage measurements that were collected across the bulk
of the last mile Internet infrastructure in the United States.

1 INTRODUCTION
“Severe weather is the number one cause of power outages in the
United States and costs the economy billions of dollars a year in lost
output and wages, spoiled inventory, delayed production,
inconvenience and damage to grid infrastructure.”
– President’s Council of Economic Advisers,
“Economic Benefits of Increasing Electric
Grid Reliance to Weather Outages”, 2013
The quote above illustrates how weather-related damage to vital
infrastructure can cause significant economic harm. Yet, little is
known about the impact of weather-induced outages on the most
pervasive infrastructure for Internet access: residential last-mile
links. U.S. policy [58] requires telcos to report outages to the FCC,
but the reporting threshold is large: the outage must last at least 30

minutes and have affected tens of thousands of customers [58]. Such
widespread Internet failures have previously received attention
from researchers, who have investigated undersea cable cuts [7, 11],
natural disasters [15, 24], and backbone router failures [27].
In practice, most weather events are much more localized and
not severe enough to generate such a large outage. For decades, this
everyday weather has been known to lead to smaller scale outages
of telecom infrastructure. For example, early telephone and cable
television engineering documents describe how to avoid moisture
in wires because it impedes signal propagation [30, 55]. Also, rain
attenuates satellite signals above 10 GHz [26]. Further, point-to-
point wireless links can experience multipath fading due to objects
moving in the wind [10]. In short, residential links are vulnerable
to everyday weather because residential equipment and wiring
are often installed outdoors: wind can blow trees onto overhead
wires, heat can cause equipment to fail, and rain can seep into
underground equipment cabinets.
Surprisingly, for these everyday weather conditions, there are
no public statistics on the frequency or magnitude of the outages
they induce. Such information could help Internet-based compa-
nies determine how many customers they lose to nature and help
regulators know which conditions and geographic areas deserve
their attention. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive
study that identifies the correlation between everyday weather and
residential Internet last-mile outages. Specifically, we quantify the
increase in the number and duration of outages observed during
weather, when compared to non-weather periods.
The correlation between weather and outages cannot be deter-
mined with a short term study. Weather is seasonal: some weather
conditions occur only at certain times of the year. Some weather
events are also rare; and these rare events (e.g., snow in Louisiana)
are particularly interesting in their effects. Targeted probing is
needed because weather is localized: at any time only specific loca-
tions are exposed to interesting weather conditions. Broad observa-
tion of outages of several links will capture correlated outages of
several hosts, such as the work by Heidemann et al. [22, 46], but
it will not reveal failures of individual links as may be the case for
weather. Although some systems can obtain detailed measurements
at residential gateways [49, 56], the limited deployment of these
measurement systems make them inadequate for studying at the
scale needed to observe many different weather conditions, multi-
ple times, in different geographic areas. Therefore, we performed
an eight year longitudinal study with targeted measurements of
residential hosts exposed to weather events.
In 2011, we introduced a measurement system for this task called
ThunderPing [52], and have run this software for the past eight
years. ThunderPing follows forecasts of weather in the U.S. and
pings a sample of 100 hosts from each last-mile provider in the
area for six hours before, during, and six hours after the forecasted
weather event. The focus of the initial paper on ThunderPing was
its probing methodology, but it also included a preliminary study

that looked at 66 days of data. Given how limited the dataset was,
we could not draw statistically significant conclusions, particularly
when looking at rare link types or rural locations. With only one
summer, we saw only a small subset of possible conditions.
This paper analyzes 1,811 days of data across eight years, captur-
ing a diversity of seasonal and regional weather conditions. This
large dataset enabled us to address these significant limitations of
our preliminary study.
There is a challenge with quantifying how weather correlates
with outages: outages are relatively uncommon events, and thus
every outage is a significant event. This is compounded by the fact
that we wish to analyze subsets of our data to focus on, say, particu-
lar link types or locations. With so few outages observed compared
to the time that hosts are responsive, it is difficult to determine if dif-
ferent weather conditions cause a statistically significant increase
in outages. To address this issue, we apply hazard rate estimation
from epidemiology to quantify, and establish statistical significance
to, the inflation in outage probability, even though failures happen
infrequently. We detail this approach in Section 3.1, as we believe
it to be of general use to the community.
Another challenge is this metric could be artificially inflated by
weather conditions coinciding with network state changes such
as maintenance [48] or renumbering [43]. Such events would also
result in previously responsive IP addresses becoming unresponsive,
resulting in what we term a dropout event. Dropouts are therefore
supersets of failures (including failures due to planned maintenance)
and IP address renumbering. We verify that weather does not appear
to be positively correlated with peak diurnal dropout periods, and
to do recovery time analysis we select dropout durations unlikely
to suffer from address renumbering, allowing us to ensure that we
are probing the same residential link before and after the outage.
We present a dataset spanning eight years, all weather condi-
tions, and 101 billion responsive pings to 10.8 million addresses
throughout the U.S. We apply techniques from epidemiology to
attribute statistically significant dropout rates to individual weather
conditions. Our key findings span five broad areas of analysis:
Failure rates increase during weather (§4.1): Most weather con-
ditions are accompanied by a statistically significant increase in
the probability of failure; surprisingly, this even includes routine
weather events such as light rain and snow. Hail, thunderstorms,
gale-force winds, heavy rain, and tornadoes are particularly dam-
aging, resulting in increases in failure rates of up to one additional
failure per 30 hours.
Link type variations (various): Different link types experience
weather in highly varying ways. For example, wireless link types
(WISPs and satellite) experience orders of magnitude greater in-
creases in failure rates than their wired counterparts (cable, DSL,
fiber) during rainy conditions.
Geographic variations (§4.2): Different geographic regions are
affected to varying degrees. For instance, Midwestern U.S. states
are more prone to failures in thunderstorms and rain than coastal
states. Also, southern states are the most prone to failures in snow.
Continuous variable analysis (§4.3): Most link types have highly
nonlinear failure rates with respect to changes in wind speed and
precipitation. Wired links experience significantly larger inflations
in failure rates when there is more than an inch of precipitation.
On the other hand, the mere presence of precipitation results in
statistically significant increases in failure rates for satellite links.
Recovery times (§5): Wired links can experience a two-fold in-
crease in recovery time during some weather conditions. Wireless
link types’ recovery durations are less strongly correlated with
weather and are often shorter during weather conditions.
Our findings have ramifications on how network outage detec-
tion and analysis should be performed; limiting measurements to
any particular geographic region, link type, or time of year can
introduce statistically significant bias. We believe our results also
have implications for network administrators and policy-makers;
an increased use of wireless links in rural areas (i.e., through the $2
billion Connect America Fund) has resulted in those states having
many short failures during weather. In this work, we studied the
frequency and severity of weather-induced failures on last-mile In-
ternet; however, our dataset allows the investigation of other issues,
including determining the root causes of weather-related outages.
To this end, we have made our analyses of the ThunderPing dataset
publicly available at: https://thunderping.cs.umd.edu
2 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY AND
DATASETS
To perform our study, we make use of ThunderPing [52], a measure-
ment infrastructure we developed to actively probe hosts within a
weather event. In this section, we describe the features of Thunder-
Ping that are salient to this paper: when, where, whom, and how
ThunderPing probes, as well as the datasets it uses in making these
decision. We also describe how we determine when there are “drop-
outs”: transitions in responsiveness to pings indicative of a fail-
ure. Last, we summarize the dataset ThunderPing has constructed
through eight years of active measurement.
2.1 Data collection methodology
The primary goals of ThunderPing are to measure the responsive-
ness of hosts before, during, and after weather events. Whereas
other active probing techniques involve scanning virtually all net-
works at regular intervals [16, 46], ThunderPing takes a more fo-
cused approach, probing hosts in regions where weather events
are likely. Here, we explain how ThunderPing performs its probing
precisely where and when it is needed.
When and where ThunderPing probes: The U.S. National Weather
Service (NWS) provides real-time “severe weather alert” forecasts.
Each such forecast includes myriad metadata [52], but of critical
importance to this study are predictions of the event’s begin time
(s), end time (t), and affected regions, specified by FIPS code—which
roughly corresponds to a U.S. county. Of course, these are merely
predictions of future weather events. ThunderPing uses them as a
best-effort guide of where and when to probe, and then follows it
up with ground-truth data of observed weather conditions.
In particular, ThunderPing probes during the interval [s−6, t +6]:
up to six hours before the predicted start and six hours after the
predicted end. This serves two purposes: it insulates against NWS’s
prediction errors, and it extends data collection to capture dropouts
and their recovery times.
Whom ThunderPing probes: In this study, we seek to understand
how weather affects different residential providers and link types.
