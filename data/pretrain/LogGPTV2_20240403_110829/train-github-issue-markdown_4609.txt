##### Description of the problem
Hi Mr. Doob,
I want to play an animation like the pump.dae backwards, is there any code out
there that does this or do I have to write it myself, I believe I have to make
modifications to the Animation.js, AnimationHandler.js, and the
KeyFrameAnimation.js to do this. Please help me as I would like to be able to
do this as quick as possible and would like some good advice.
Thanks!
