User: Okay, I'm completely new to this. 
I created a python script that imports tkinter. On my Ubuntu, I can execute the program from the terminal program. Till now there is no problem. However, my friends asked if I could deliver the program to them so that they could use it on their PC. They have 0 knowledge of programming and they use Windows -.-. So my question is, how I can create an executable file from Ubuntu so that it can run under Windows? I've already read something about py2exe, but I could not manage installing it. If
Assistant: You can't use py2exe on plain Ubuntu. It needs to run from Windows. Right now, py2exe doesn't work well with Wine. Do you not have access to any Windows computers (maybe one of your friends')?
You can also get your friends to install Python on their Windows machines and teach them how to run your programs, if you're willing to put in the extra effort.
