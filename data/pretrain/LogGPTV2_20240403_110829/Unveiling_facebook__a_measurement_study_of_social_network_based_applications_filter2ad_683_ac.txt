(GL and Hugged)12, or they perform an action in the same
game instance (FC). Given this deﬁnition of interaction, we
deﬁne the interaction graph G = (V, E) such that for all
unique users performing activities on a speciﬁc Facebook ap-
plication, there ∃v ∈ V , and an undirected edge (x, y) ∈ E
for each interacting pair of users x, y. Additional concepts
needed for the analysis presented next are:
Component: Two nodes x and y belong to the same
component if ∃ (x, y) ∈ E. A component’s nodes are only
connected with other nodes in the same component.
Clustering Coeﬃcient: The clustering coeﬃcient of a
node v ∈ V is the ratio of number of edges between neighbors
x of v (such that ∃ (x, v) ∈ E) and the total number of edges
possible between those neighbors. The clustering coeﬃcient
of a graph is the average of individual nodes’ clustering co-
eﬃcients.
Community: A community in a graph is a set of nodes
such that the ratio of edges between these nodes, and edges
from these nodes to nodes outside of this community is ‘high’
[13]. That is, a community is a densely connected subgraph
of G.
Structure Coeﬃcient: Let eij be the fraction of (to-
tal) edges in the graph that connect vertices in community
i to vertices in community j, and let ai ≡ P
eij . Then
the structure coeﬃcient of the graph is
i ). Com-
munity structure in a network is said to be strong if the
structure coeﬃcient is more than 0.3 [13].

5.2 Results
For the results discussed below, we used 1-week data (sub-
set of the 3-week data) starting April 4, 2008 gathered through
FC, GL, and Hugged. This was done primarily due to com-
putationally expensive algorithms needed for the results pro-
duced here13.
Table 3 shows the number of unique interacting nodes
and edges in the interaction graphs for the 1-week trace.
Our ﬁrst consideration in attempting to relieve the scalabil-
ity concerns was to extract disconnected components from
the interaction graphs on all applications. Our results show
10Note that we were only able to geographically map a subset
of the actual active users, as discussed in Section 3.
11Due to the ﬁxed length of games on FC (15 to 48 hours),
our users focus on entering game instances as close to the
games’ end as possible. This is done in order to prevent
opponents from gaining points by hitting back in the game
instance. Due to the competitive nature of the game, this
translates into following gaming deadlines very closely, often
down to the last second.
12Individuals A and B performing activity on the same user
are said to interact as this is important with regards to scal-
ability concerns: the same data point (C) is being accessed
by the active individuals.
13The graph sizes for the 3-week trace had at least twice as
many nodes and edges as compared to the 1 week trace for
our applications. Due to CPU and memory limitations, we
focused on a smaller (representative) trace for the experi-
ments performed.

Figure 10: Community size distributions, geographical diversities, maximum number of users in same locality, and network
diversities for FC, GL and Hugged. We only display the results for the 51 largest communities in the ﬁgures above since
FC, which has the lowest number of communities, has only 51 communities. Within the results for each application, the
community IDs on the x-axes indicate measurements for the same communities.

that activity was structured on our applications such that
most users were part of a single connected component, mean-
ing component-wise segregation of activity data cannot, on
its own, provide a solution for scalability. Furthermore, we
found the percentage of total users in the largest component
to be proportional to the number of users in each applica-
tion’s trace. This implies that as we consider larger data sets
for analysis of component sizes, more and more nodes fall
into the largest component. As remarked previously in [10],
this lop-sided distribution of component sizes is an artifact
of social networks generally, and since this result holds re-
gardless of application nature in our data, we expect our
results hold for interaction on social applications as well.
Community-wise division of data seems attractive in that
OSNs have previously been shown to exhibit strong com-
munity structure [10]. However, interaction on social ap-
plications, since it goes beyond the underlying social net-
work’s friendship graph, may result in distinct community
characteristics. Furthermore, we wish to gauge the extent
to which metrics such as geographical classiﬁcation of users
might capture community structures of the interaction graph
on social applications.
To this end, we extracted community structures from the
interaction graphs derived from our applications using New-
man’s Leading Eigenvector community extraction algorithm
implemented in the iGraph library for manipulating graphs
[15]. The reader is referred to [13] for details on this algo-
rithm14. The results of community extraction on FC, GL
and Hugged are shown in Table 3. We found that although
Hugged and GL show very strong community structure, FC
lacks this property. This is indicated by the low structure
coeﬃcient for FC (which is a lot less than 0.3). As a result,
the maximum-size community for FC accounts for 72.6% of
the users, whereas that for GL and Hugged accounts for less
than 10%. Furthermore, we plot the community size dis-
tributions for FC, GL, and Hugged in Figures 10a, 10b, and
10c to show that the distribution of community sizes is quite
biased for FC, while it exhibits a wider spread for both GL
and Hugged. This result, then, clearly distinguishes FC, a
social game, from GL and Hugged. We conjecture that diﬀer-
ent Facebook applications will exhibit diﬀerent community
structures based on the nature of user interactions (e.g., so-
cial gaming vs. non-gaming applications). We discuss the
reason for the lack of community structure (in FC) later in
Section 6.
For each application, we also measure the number of dis-
tinct geographical locations (countries) whose users consti-
tute one community. We call this the geographical diver-
sity of communities. For the sizable communities extracted,
lower geographical diversity may hint at a possible solution
with regards to scalability (e.g., by having distributed local
servers). Figures 10d, 10e, and 10f show the geographical
diversity for the 51 most sizable communities for FC, GL,
and Hugged, respectively.
We found that instead of being geographically-focused,
