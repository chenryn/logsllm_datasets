### Interaction and Graph Definitions

In the context of our analysis, an interaction is defined as two unique users performing activities on the same Facebook application, either by engaging in a common game instance (FC) or through specific actions like "GL" and "Hugged." Based on this definition, we construct an interaction graph \( G = (V, E) \), where each unique user is represented as a vertex \( v \in V \), and an undirected edge \((x, y) \in E\) exists for every interacting pair of users \( x \) and \( y \).

### Additional Concepts

- **Component**: Two nodes \( x \) and \( y \) belong to the same component if there exists an edge \((x, y) \in E\). Nodes within a component are only connected to other nodes within the same component.
  
- **Clustering Coefficient**: The clustering coefficient of a node \( v \in V \) is the ratio of the number of edges between its neighbors (where \((x, v) \in E\)) to the total number of possible edges between those neighbors. The clustering coefficient of the entire graph is the average of the clustering coefficients of all individual nodes.

- **Community**: A community in a graph is a set of nodes that have a high ratio of internal edges (edges between nodes within the community) compared to external edges (edges from these nodes to nodes outside the community). This indicates a densely connected subgraph within \( G \).

- **Structure Coefficient**: Let \( e_{ij} \) be the fraction of total edges in the graph connecting vertices in community \( i \) to vertices in community \( j \), and let \( a_i \equiv \sum e_{ij} \). The structure coefficient of the graph is given by:
  \[
  \text{Structure Coefficient} = \frac{e_{ii} - a_i^2}{\sum a_i}
  \]
  A strong community structure is indicated by a structure coefficient greater than 0.3 [13].

### Results

For the results presented below, we used data collected over a one-week period (a subset of the three-week data) starting from April 4, 2008, gathered through FC, GL, and Hugged. This was primarily due to the computational intensity of the algorithms required for the analysis [13].

### Analysis and Observations

- **Component Analysis**: Most users were part of a single connected component, indicating that segregating activity data by components alone does not solve scalability issues. The percentage of users in the largest component is proportional to the number of users in each application's trace, suggesting that larger datasets will have more nodes in the largest component. This lopsided distribution is a characteristic feature of social networks [10].

- **Community Structure**: Community-wise division of data is attractive due to the strong community structure observed in OSNs [10]. However, interactions on social applications may exhibit distinct community characteristics. We used Newman’s Leading Eigenvector community extraction algorithm [15] to extract community structures from the interaction graphs. 

- **Community Characteristics**:
  - **Fighters’ Club (FC)**: Despite having a low structure coefficient (0.03), FC lacks a strong community structure. The largest community accounts for 72.6% of users, with a biased community size distribution.
  - **Got Love? (GL) and Hugged**: Both GL and Hugged show very strong community structures, with the largest communities accounting for less than 10% of users and a wider spread in community sizes.

- **Geographical Diversity**: We measured the number of distinct geographical locations (countries) in each community, termed as geographical diversity. Figures 10d, 10e, and 10f show the geographical diversity for the 51 most sizable communities in FC, GL, and Hugged, respectively. Lower geographical diversity suggests potential scalability solutions, such as using distributed local servers.

- **Network Diversity and Local User Distribution**: Figures 10g, 10h, and 10i illustrate the maximum number of local users per community, while Figures 10j, 10k, and 10l depict network diversities for the 51 largest communities in FC, GL, and Hugged.

### Conclusion

Our analysis reveals that different Facebook applications exhibit varying community structures based on the nature of user interactions. While GL and Hugged show strong community structures, FC lacks this property, which is attributed to its social gaming nature. Further, geographical and network diversities provide insights into potential scalability solutions for these applications.
