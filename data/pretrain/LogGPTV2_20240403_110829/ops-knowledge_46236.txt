User: I'm a new user of Python
I installed Python35 for Windows. Hello.py runs fine in a terminal.
When trying to run the same in Geany the path is not found.
These are the settings in Geany:
Compile: C:\Python35\python -m py_compile "%f"
Execute: C:\Python35\python  ¨%f¨
What I'm doing wrong?
Assistant: Execute: C:\Python35\python ¨%f¨

This string contains the diaeresis character (¨) (U+00A8) instead of the double quote (") (U+0022).
