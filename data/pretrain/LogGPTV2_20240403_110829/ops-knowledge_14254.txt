User: How to use cron to schedule tasks to periodically compress files in a certain directory and delete original files in Linux?
Assistant: This is a simple step: 1. Open a terminal and enter the following command: ```bash crontab -e ``` This will open a new file to write the crontab file 2. Add the following line at the bottom of the file: ```bash 0 0 * * * tar -cvzf /path/to/archive.tar.gz /path/to/folder/* && rm /path/to/folder/* ``` This command is executed daily at midnight (0:00). It will compress all files under "/path/to/folder" directory and save the compressed file in "/path/to/archive.tar.gz". It then deletes the original file to free up disk space. Make sure to substitute appropriate values in path and filename. 3. Save and close the file. 4. Now Cron will execute the task at the specified time. Note: When using Cron, make sure you have sufficient permissions to read and write to all files and directories involved.
