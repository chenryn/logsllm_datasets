User: How to use NGINX reverse proxy to improve website access speed and security?
Assistant: 1. Compress files: Nginx supports gzip compression, which compresses files on the server, thereby effectively reducing the amount of transmitted data and speeding up file loading. 2. Cache static files: For static files (such as pictures, CSS files, JS files, etc.), Nginx can cache these files, and they can be read directly from the cache the next time they are accessed, reducing server response time and improving access speed. 3. Load balancing: Through the Nginx reverse proxy technology, the traffic can be distributed to multiple servers (such as multiple application services or multiple nodes), avoiding the overload of a single node, and improving the high availability and access speed of the website. 4. HTTPS protocol: Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy and supports the HTTPS protocol to effectively guarantee the security of user information. 5. DDos prevention: Nginx can defend against DDos attacks, and ensure the availability of the website by limiting the access speed of each IP and limiting the number of simultaneous connections. 6. Preventing attacks: Nginx can use the WAF function to filter and detect access requests to prevent threats such as SQL injection and XSS attacks.
