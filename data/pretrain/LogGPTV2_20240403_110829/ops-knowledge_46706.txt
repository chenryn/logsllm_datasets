### How to Set a Public Hostname for Your Network

You have a 100/100 Mbps link with a static public IP configured on a Cisco router. On the LAN side, you have a domain controller with a DNS server and multiple computers. You want these computers to be identified by your domain name (e.g., `domain.com`) rather than their IP address when they access external services.

#### Steps to Set Up a Public Hostname

1. **PTR Record (Reverse DNS)**
   - **Purpose**: To map your public IP address to a hostname, which is often used in logging and email systems.
   - **Process**:
     - Check if your ISP allows you to set custom PTR records for your public IP. You can use the ARIN WHOIS IP Address Database to find the owner of the IP block.
     - If allowed, request your ISP to set up a PTR record that maps your public IP to your desired hostname. For example:
       ```
       34.216.184.93.in-addr.arpa. 3600 IN     PTR     domain.com.
       ```

2. **A Record (Forward DNS)**
   - **Purpose**: To map your domain name to your public IP address.
   - **Process**:
     - Add an A record in your DNS server to map your domain name to your public IP. For example:
       ```
       domain.com.                86400 IN     A       93.184.216.34
       ```

#### Example Configuration

- **PTR Record**:
  ```
  34.216.184.93.in-addr.arpa. 3600 IN     PTR     domain.com.
  ```

- **A Record**:
  ```
  domain.com.                86400 IN     A       93.184.216.34
  ```

#### Considerations

- **Email Servers (SMTP)**:
  - Ensure that the reverse DNS (PTR record) matches the SMTP banner (the name your mail server uses to introduce itself). This is important for email deliverability and spam prevention.
  - If you cannot change the PTR record, update the SMTP banner to match the existing reverse DNS.

- **Security and Privacy**:
  - Be cautious about setting up a custom PTR record, as it can reveal that the IP address is associated with your company, potentially making it a target for denial of service attacks.
  - Most organizations avoid custom PTR records for this reason.

- **Logging and Visibility**:
  - The logs on remote servers are typically only seen by technical personnel, so the visibility of your domain name in these logs is limited.
  - Custom PTR records are more relevant for technical and security purposes rather than for general visibility or marketing.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your network traffic is identified by your domain name in external logs and other systems, provided your ISP supports the necessary DNS configurations.
