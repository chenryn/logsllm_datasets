AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
Key Result: Operations and Maintenance Cost Savings 
Operations and maintenance (O&M) cost savings from remote billing and metering 
services is one of the most significant benefit streams for AMI business case analysis.  
In total, SGIG utilities using AMI for remote meter reading and meter service orders avoided 13,785,708 
meter operations truck rolls6 and 68,374,295 vehicle-miles traveled7 from the summer of 2011 to the 
winter of 2014. The reduction in truck rolls across SGIG utilities saved an estimated 15,160 tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from April 2011 to March 2015.8 On average, a utility saved about 
1.3 vehicle-miles traveled every six months for every smart meter deployed. 
The Electric Power Board of Chattanooga (EPB) and NV Energy had full-scale AMI deployments and 
conducted wholesale conversions of manual processes to automated meter reading and remote service 
order fulfillment—resulting in significant O&M cost savings. NV Energy 
also has a highly transient customer base that historically has required 
relatively frequent requests for service connections and disconnections.  
→ See Case Study: Electric 
Power Board (page 38) 
Larger smart meter deployments generally resulted in higher O&M 
cost savings from smart meter automation. However, utilities with low customer densities and 
geographically dispersed service territories have greater savings potential than those located in densely 
populated urban areas. In addition, utilities that replaced electro-mechanical meters with AMI generally 
had higher incremental cost savings than those who replaced automated meter reading (AMR) with 
AMI. The average per-meter operations and maintenance cost savings was $8.37 over a six-month 
period in 2014 for 19 SGIG projects—though actual savings vary highly by project.  
From 2011-2014, 19 projects reported a cumulative O&M cost savings of more than $316 million, 
resulting in an average of $16.6 million savings per project over three 
years. However, the range of actual per-project savings was quite large; 
three of the projects realized the majority of the total savings, with 
more than $174 million saved by one project alone.

CenterPoint Energy (page 38) 
CenterPoint Energy, for example, reported AMI cost savings of more 
than $61 million from 2012-2014. Tri-State Electric Membership 
Corporation realized a 65 percent decrease in annual meter operations 
costs from a high of about $450,000 per year in 2011, to about $156,000 
per year in 2013.

Key Result: Improved Accuracy and Customer Services 
AMI and related systems can dramatically reduce and help quickly address customer 
complaints by empowering customers and utility service representatives with access to accurate, timely, 
on-demand information about customer consumption and costs.

AMI-enabled bill generation results in fewer customer complaints about inaccurate bills and enables 
utilities to resolve billing disputes faster than before. Several SGIG projects report improvements in bill 
dispute resolution rates, because customer service representatives can now access real-time and 
historical energy use information to field customer questions. AMI improves the accuracy of meter 
readings by automating activities previously accomplished manually, minimizing human and other 
errors. For example, hand-held reads are subject to probe failures, 
manual keying errors, meter memory failures, and wiring issues that can 
cause low reads. With AMI, utilities no longer have to estimate or 
interpolate bills, or offer bill adjustments, due to meter reading errors or 
missed readings.  
→ See Case Study: 
Oklahoma Gas and Electric 
(page 30) 
Access to detailed information on consumption and costs using IHDs or web portals, and the availability 
of this information at any time of day or night, helped customers to self-diagnose causes of high 
electricity bills and develop strategies for better managing consumption and costs without needing to 
contact utility customer service representatives. Utility customer service representatives can retrieve 
customer billing details instantaneously and are better able to find causes and suggest energy efficiency 
solutions or alternative rate options.  
AMI enables utilities to proactively address customer billing issues. When appropriately programmed, 
CIS can prompt utility customer service representatives to preemptively contact customers about 
unusual usage patterns in advance of the bill being sent. Effective training of customer service personnel 
is paramount for using the enhanced information and implementing 
advanced billing and complaint-reducing features. AMI enabled unique 
proactive problem solving:

•  South Norwalk Electric and Water—a member of Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy 
Cooperative (CMEEC)—uses the service connect/disconnect switch to show customers in multi-
dwelling buildings that the meter for which they are being billed is the correct meter for their 
account. This test can be performed remotely without a meter technician on site.  
•  Before AMI, Raft River Rural Electric Cooperative in Idaho, a member of the Pacific Northwest 
Generating Cooperative (PNGC), would disconnect all irrigation accounts in the fall, and then 
leverage seasonal charges in the spring. With AMI, Raft now tracks irrigation accounts, and 
automatically determines when they are operating and if bills need to be sent. This reduces 
operating costs for truck rolls and labor. 
Utilities with AMI are now able to fulfill remote service connection and disconnection orders in hours 
instead of days. Before AMI, customers waited several days for the utility to address service requests. 
Typical of many SGIG projects, Central Maine Power (CMP) reports now 
being able to fulfill reconnection service orders remotely in under 7 
minutes.

2.2  Online Bill Payments and Pre-Pay Billing Plans 
Online bill payment provides customer convenience while eliminating traditional paper payment 
processing costs, errors, and delays. Pre-pay billing programs reduce billing fluctuations, unanticipated 
high electric bills, and service disruptions for customers on pre-pay programs by communicating usage 
on regular intervals. In addition, unpaid bill write-offs for utilities were reduced.9 Seven utilities offered 
pre-payment plans, which are used to help customers closely track their energy consumption and costs 
and help utilities to reduce the amount of unpaid bills.  
Online bill payment capabilities are common in the electric power industry, but the implementation of 
web portals in connection with AMI deployments has enhanced customer insight. Greater customer use 
of this service reduces costs of paper bills and lowers error rates from processing paper payment slips 
and checks. Online bill payments require development of secure and user-friendly web portal interfaces 
for processing payment information. While AMI is not necessary to implement online bill payments, it 
can help streamline the process and results in fewer data entry errors.  
Many utilities have developed mobile phone applications for customers to access billing information, 
receive usage alerts, submit payments, and report outages. Because mobile phone networks generally 
remain in service during power outages, the outage reporting feature is useful for timely reporting of 
outages without over-burdening customer service representatives. 
Key Result: Enhanced Revenues and Reduced Bad Debt Write-Offs 
Several utilities improved revenue collection and cost recovery by implementing pre-pay billing 
programs that help customers avoid defaulting on their bills.  
Pre-pay billing plans contributed to a reduction in bad debt write-offs10 and allowed participating 
customers to budget electricity use. Reducing debt write-offs improves revenue collection, which 
strengthens cost recovery and improves the financial health of the 
utility. These improvements ultimately benefit customers because 
utilities are better able to manage operating costs.  
→ See Case Study: Talquin 
Electric Cooperative (page 40) 
For utilities, pre-pay also reduced billing-related operational costs (because pre-pay is usually paperless) 
and reduced customer service complaints. In addition, services can be remotely disconnected or 
reconnected based on account balances, avoiding service calls and truck rolls. 
Talquin Electric Cooperative (TEC) decreased its bad debt write-offs by about 65 percent since 2011 due 
in part to its pre-pay program offering. Tri-State Electric Membership Corporation's bad debt decreased 
from almost $46,000 in 2011 when the pre-pay program started to about $21,000 in 2013. Also, 
effective bad debt fell by 97 percent, from $44,000 to just over $1,000 between 2011 and 2013.  
Pre-pay billing plans provide convenient services for customers 
needing assistance in managing consumption and costs. For customers, 
pre-pay plans reduce or eliminate service deposits, late fees, and

reconnect fees; reduce post-paid billing surprises due to unexpected or high usage (e.g., high heating or 
cooling requirements); and can help track consumption and costs using web portals and automated 
alerts by email, text message, and phone call. Pre-pay plans also offer seasonal or temporary customers 
with an improved ability to obtain and manage electricity services.  
2.3  Meter Tampering and Theft Detection 
Historically, meter readers or headquarters personnel detected electricity theft by identifying abnormal 
changes in electricity usage over long periods. Customers have been known to go to great lengths to 
steal electricity, often breaking into or attempting to bypass meters. In many cases, people tampering 
with meters risk getting burned, electrocuted, or even killed. While only small numbers of customers are 
typically involved in meter tampering and electricity theft, Forbes reported in 2013 that electricity thefts 
amount to about $6 billion annually, which would make electricity the nation’s “the third most stolen 
item, after credit card data and automobiles.”11 
SGIG funding recipients used AMI to program MDMS to detect instances of meter tampering, which 
indicated potential cases of electricity theft. Many utilities have systems that issue alarms or 
notifications when irregularities in consumption activity are identified. The SGIG utilities found that the 
tamper incidents in many instances were not always due to actual theft, but sometimes 
faulty meters.  
Key Result: Enhanced Revenue Collection 
New capabilities for tamper and theft detection through AMI deployments enhance revenue and cost 
recovery. Utilities are able to improve revenue collection and cost recovery from enhanced theft 
detection capabilities, identification of faulty meters, and registering previously unregistered (and 
therefore non-paying) meters. Additional benefits include labor hour savings, fewer truck rolls, and 
reduced time to find violators.  
Utilities on average confirmed 951 tamper detections, with six utilities reporting more than 1,000 
incidents and two utilities confirming more than 5,000 incidents (out of 29 projects reporting). One 
utility identified 600 improperly configured meters.  
CenterPoint Energy boosted revenue collections by more than $4.5 
million from 2012 to 2014 from the identification of slow meters, 
unregistered meters, and electricity theft.  
→ See Case Study: 
CenterPoint Energy (page 38) 
Tamper detection also created new technical challenges for several utilities who faced increased 
tamper detection costs when false alarms required field investigations. Several utilities are now 
working to develop better data analytics to differentiate actual theft incidents from the many different 
events that can trigger tamper alarms. Data analytics can be used to reduce the number of false 
positives and unnecessary truck rolls.

2.4  Outage Detection and Management 
AMI became an essential aspect of service restoration activities and OMS operations for the many 
SGIG projects that augmented their investments in DA implementing AMI. Smart meter data enabled 
these utilities to reduce the costs and boost the effectiveness of outage management operations. Smart 
meters with outage detection and notification automatically transmit a “last gasp” notification when 
power to the meter is lost. Smart meters enable automatic outage and restoration notification, which 
previously had to be verified by phone or service call. Last-gasp meter alerts enable grid operators to 
identify outage locations and dispatch repair crews to more precise locations where they are needed. 
The alert includes the meter number and a time stamp, which indicates the location of the meter and 
the time of the outage. Smart meters can also transmit “power on” notifications to the head-end 
systems or OMS when power is restored. This information can be used to more effectively manage 
service restoration efforts and help ensure that no other outages have occurred before repair crews are 
demobilized. Utilities can “ping” smart meters in outage-affected areas to assess outage boundaries and 
verify when power has been restored to specific customers. 
AMI enables different—but complementary—outage management functions from those enabled by DA 
technologies.12 AMI monitors outages at the customer meter to help utilities assess and characterize 
outage events, whereas DA technologies monitor outages at feeders and substations and, in some cases, 
help automate power restoration on feeders and substations. AMI and DA outage management 
functions combine effectively, particularly when AMI is integrated with DMS.13 
Key Result: More Accurate  Outage Location to Support Rapid Restoration 
AMI enables utilities to identify outages more quickly and to dispatch repair more precisely, thus 
reducing the duration of outages and producing lower outage costs and fewer inconveniences for 
customers. In addition, remote meter queries shorten service restoration times by identifying “nested” 
outages—an electrical problem that is “masked” by a larger outage. In 
these situations, which generally follow severe weather events, repair 
crews fix obvious problems and believe power has been restored to an 
entire area. Before AMI, repair crews would normally leave at this 
point, unaware of the secondary electrical problem until customers 
affected by the nested outage call to complain. Remote meter query can avoid the restoration delays 
associated with nested outage identification.

Lincoln Peoples Utility 
District (page 42) 
AMI reduces labor hours and truck rolls associated with outage 
diagnosis and restoration. In the past, customers called a hotline to 
notify the utility of an outage. Once the repair was made, the utility 
assumed all customers on the feeder had their power restored. In large-
scale outages, this is often an incorrect assumption, leading to further

customer calls and complaints. Because meter status can be checked without a truck roll, one utility 
avoided more than 300 “okay-on-arrival” truck rolls during one storm alone.  
Utilities facing regular, severe weather events and storm-induced outages have greater incentives for 
using AMI for outage management. Several of the SGIG projects implemented major recovery 
operations following Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012. SGIG projects in the Mid-
Atlantic and Northeastern states reported using AMI to support restoration efforts following these 
devastating storms.  
Not all utilities are in a position to take on the challenges and integrate AMI with OMS, DMS, SCADA, 
GIS, and other distribution operations systems. While last-gasp alerts and meter pinging capabilities are 
available for all smart meter deployments, there are systems integration issues to tackle in making full 
use of them.  
Key Result: Improved Outage Information Sharing and Customer 
Notification 
Once AMI data has been processed and integrated with CIS, OMS, and 
GIS, utility personnel have access to more accurate and timely data about 
outages and service restoration activities. New software tool and mapping 
capabilities boost overall situational awareness when outages occur, and 
enable utility officials to provide customers, first responders, local officials, and the news media with 
better information to improve customer satisfaction levels and coordination with government agencies 
and the public.  
→ See Case Study: Electric 
Power Board (page 38) 
→ See Case Study: Burbank 
Water and Power (page 58) 
Some utilities used GIS with smart meter data to create detailed outage maps, and in some cases 
posted these maps on utility websites to keep the public and local media informed with service 
restoration progress. Meter pinging enables operators to track progress 
and inform repair crews of customers still without power. All of these 
efforts measurably improved outage restoration processes and 
procedures, lowered costs, accelerated repairs, shortened outage durations, and reduced customer 
outage costs and inconveniences.  
2.5  Voltage Monitoring 
Utilities can use AMI voltage monitoring capabilities to enhance the effectiveness of automated 
controls for voltage and reactive power management, particularly for conservation voltage reduction 
(CVR) programs. Voltage monitoring is the smart meter capability to measure voltage levels and certain 
power quality parameters, which utilities can use to develop accurate voltage profiles across feeder lines 
throughout the system. For example, smart meters can be used to measure current transients and 
harmonics; this feature is most often activated for industrial customers who operate sensitive 
machinery, motors, and rotating equipment. Data on voltages can be used to diagnose customer voltage 
issues remotely and determine if the issue is related to the distribution system or is the result of factors 
occurring inside customer premises. Voltage data is processed by the DMS and can be used by grid 
operators to develop distribution system models and optimize voltages across the grid.  
26 
AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
Key Result: Enhanced Voltage and Reactive Power Management 
 With smart meter voltage monitoring, grid operators can assess voltage conditions and 
ensure CVR operations maintain voltage levels within acceptable limits. Several SGIG projects 
successfully did this. Benefits from these practices include reduced line losses and peak demands, 
improvements in power factors, and energy savings. Voltage monitoring and controls provide utilities 
with another resource option for managing grid operations, controlling costs, and maintaining adequate 
supply-demand balances. 
SGIG utilities testing voltage monitoring and reactive power 
management applications often used AMI capabilities in conjunction 
with DA technologies and systems. Project results specific to those DA 
technologies are reported separately and in greater detail in Distribution Automation: Results from the 
SGIG Program.  
→ See Case Study: Central 
Lincoln Peoples Utility 
District (page 42)  
Voltage monitoring provides another useful benefit stream to include in business case analysis of AMI 
investments. Since it is used in conjunction with other smart grid technologies and systems, such as line 
sensors, voltage regulators, and automated capacitor banks, it can be difficult to estimate the 
incremental value of AMI in evaluating investments in automated controls for voltages and reactive 
power management. Utilities are developing tools for data analytics to support such analysis, which 
would not be possible without voltage data from AMI deployments on affected substations and feeders. 
Voltage monitoring capabilities are available on smart meter deployments, but not all utilities are 
currently using them. Prior to the SGIG program, the business case for CVR using smart meters was not 
clear. Continued demonstration of CVR benefits by leading utilities and growing market adoption of DER 
is likely to drive utility interest in investments in voltage monitoring and control technologies and 
systems. Even if not used at the outset of AMI deployments, utilities can enable this capability when 
they are ready to move forward with automated controls for voltage and reactive power management.

AMI System and Communications: A combination of radio, microwave, and fiber optic technology 
support AMI. Using cellular signal boosters, WiMAX 3650-megahertz (MHz) radios, 900 MHz radios, and 
signal repeaters eliminated the need for more costly satellite services. In addition, the amalgamated 
network includes back-up cellular communications, back-up battery power, data security encryption, 
and advanced site designs for hard-to-reach areas. Two-way communications with AMI meters occurs 
via private radio network.  
AMI Cost Savings: CenterPoint Energy reported AMI cost savings in a regulatory filing of more than $61 
million from 2012-2014. Table 5 provides a breakdown of the cost savings. The availability of more 
detailed and timely data on peak electricity usage and distribution system conditions improves load 
forecasting and capital investment planning. 
Fuel Savings and Reduced Service Order Fees: Cumulative fuel savings reached about 950,000 gallons as 
of August 31, 2014. CenterPoint Energy processed almost 10 million automated service orders from 
2009-2014, saving customers approximately $24 million annually in service order fees.
