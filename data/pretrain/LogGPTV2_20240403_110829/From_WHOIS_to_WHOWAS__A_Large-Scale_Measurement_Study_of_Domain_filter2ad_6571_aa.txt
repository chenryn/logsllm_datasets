Abstract—When a domain is registered, information about the 
registrants  and  other  related  personnel  is  recorded  by  WHOIS 
databases  owned  by  registrars  or  registries  (called  WHOIS 
providers  jointly),  which  are  open  to  public  inquiries.  However, 
due  to  the  enforcement  of  the  European  Union’s  General  Data 
Protection  Regulation  (GDPR),  certain  WHOIS  data  (i.e.,  the 
records about EEA, or the European Economic Area, registrants) 
needs  to  be  redacted  before  being  released  to  the  public.  Anec-
dotally,  it  was  reported  that  actions  have  been  taken  by  some 
WHOIS  providers.  Yet,  so  far  there  is  no  systematic  study  to 
quantify the changes made by the WHOIS providers in response 
to  the  GDPR,  their  strategies  for  data  redaction  and  impact  on 
other  applications  relying  on  WHOIS  data.
In  this  study,  we  report  the  ﬁrst  large-scale  measurement 
study to answer these questions, in hopes of guiding the enforce-
ment  of  the  GDPR  and  identifying  pitfalls  during  compliance. 
This study is made possible by analyzing a collection of 1.2 billion 
WHOIS  records  spanning  two  years.  To  automate  the  analysis 
tasks, we build a new system GCChecker based on unsupervised 
learning,  which  assigns  a  compliance  score  to  a  provider.  Our 
ﬁndings of WHOIS GDPR compliance are multi-fold. To highlight 
a  few,  we  discover  that  the  GDPR  has  a  profound  impact 
on  WHOIS,  with  over  85%  surveyed  large  WHOIS  providers 
redacting  EEA  records  at  scale.  Surprisingly,  over  60%  large 
WHOIS data providers also redact non-EEA records. A variety of 
compliance ﬂaws like incomplete redaction are also identiﬁed. The 
impact on security applications is prominent and redesign might 
be  needed.  We  believe  different  communities  (security,  domain 
and  legal)  should  work  together  to  solve  the  issues  for  better 
WHOIS  privacy  and  utility.

INTRODUCTION
The  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR)  was 
established  to  set  up  new  policies  to  protect  the  privacy  of 
personal  data  within  the  European  Union.  Since  it  went  into 
effect  in  May  2018,  prominent  changes  have  been  made  by 
companies  across  sectors  to  comply  with  the  GDPR  require-
ments.  To measure  the  impact  of  the  GDPR,  previous  works 
have focused on the web space, including website cookies [42],

of privacy notices [104], [78], [79], [90], [50], [49], [27], [72].
Due to its broad scope, not only does the GDPR protect
normal users browsing websites, users setting up websites and
the associated infrastructure are also protected. One example
is domain registration. After a user registers a domain name,
e.g., example.com, its sponsoring registrar and upper-stream
registry will store his/her personal information like name and
address in the WHOIS database, and release it when receiving
a WHOIS query. Such registration data is clearly within the
GDPR’s scope and in response, ICANN proposed a Temporary
Speciﬁcation [11] to instruct its contracted registries and regis-
trars (or WHOIS providers)1 to redact the personal information
from WHOIS records.
However, redacting WHOIS records could also hamper the
utility of applications that protect Internet users. For a long
time, WHOIS serves as a critical data source for the security
community, providing clues to track malicious domain owners
and the associated cyber-attack activities. Disagreements be-
tween legal authorities and technical communities [73] on how
to align WHOIS data with the new privacy regulations were
raised. Anecdotally, some investigators complained about the
utility loss of WHOIS data, and that the time to trace cyber-
crime has been signiﬁcantly elongated [25]. By contrast, some
people insist that tracing threats using the post-GDPR WHOIS
information is still good enough [26]. Despite those anecdotal
evidence, so far there is not yet a systemic study quantifying
the impact of the GDPR on the WHOIS system, answering
questions like how many WHOIS providers redact WHOIS
data? how do they redact the data? how large is the impact
on the security applications? These knowledge gaps should
be ﬁlled so as to guide the enforcement of privacy policies
(including the GDPR and others like the CCPA [13]) in the
future, which motivates us to carry out this study.
Challenges. Analyzing WHOIS data in the lens of the GDPR
is non-trivial, and several challenges need to be addressed
ahead. 1) The domain ecosystem is very fragmented: there
are thousands of registries and registrars running WHOIS,
resulting in inconsistent data format and wide-spread data
sources. 2) The time when WHOIS providers complied with
the GDPR is never announced. Thus, WHOIS records covering

a long time-span (e.g., months before and after the GDPR
effective date) need to be collected for in-depth analysis of
the responses of WHOIS providers. 3) Due to the vagueness
of the ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation, WHOIS providers can
apply various redaction methods. Therefore, applying simple
methods like keyword matching on WHOIS records to check
their compliance will result in high error rates.
Our Study. In this paper, we report the ﬁrst comprehensive
data-driven analysis on the GDPR compliance of the domain
registration ecosystem. To address the ﬁrst and second chal-
lenges, we collaborate with an industrial partner and access a
passive WHOIS dataset containing WHOIS records collected
from Jan 2018 to Dec 2019. We are able to analyze 1.2 billion
WHOIS records about 267 million domain names in total.
Not only are the changes before and after the GDPR effective
date observed, a large number of EEA (the European Economic
Area) domains are covered (over 32 million). To address the
third challenge, We design a system named GCChecker based
on unsupervised learning and natural
language processing
(NLP). Our key insight is that a GDPR-compliant WHOIS
provider prefers to use simple and automated approaches to
replace records at scale. Therefore, for each WHOIS provider,
by analyzing the statistical distribution of its record values, we
can conclude whether it complies with the GDPR and the level
of compliance. We use DBSCAN to identify outliers (non-
compliant records) and a NER annotator to reﬁne the results.
We ﬁnd the outlier ratio can indicate the degree of GDPR-
compliance at high accuracy.
Major ﬁndings. We run GCChecker on the entire passive
WHOIS dataset and highlight the major ﬁndings below. 1) The
enforcement of the GDPR has brought a signiﬁcant impact on
the WHOIS ecosystem: over 85% large WHOIS providers
(in terms of sponsored EEA domains) we study (89 registrars
and 54 registries) are now GDPR-compliant, meaning that the
WHOIS ﬁelds containing personal information are redacted
at scale. Surprisingly, 3 registries are still not fully-compliant
as of Dec 2019, though they are direct delegates of ICANN.
To understand the impact on smaller WHOIS providers, we
adjust the parameters of GCChecker and include additional
48 registrars and 65 registries. As a result, we ﬁnd smaller
providers are more likely to be partially-compliant or non-
compliant. Besides, we discover various ﬂawed implementa-
tions of GDPR compliance. For example, 6 registrars mask
only part of the registrant’s ﬁelds, and 21 registrars do not
offer alternative channels to contact domain holders, which
are actually requested by ICANN. Regarding the scope of
protected domains, we ﬁnd in a surprise that over 60% large
WHOIS providers apply the same protection mechanism on
both EEA and non-EEA domains, though only EEA domains
are regulated by the GDPR.
Our measurement results indicate fundamental changes of
the WHOIS system in response to the GDPR. Given that
alternative channels for security researchers and practitioners
(e.g., tiered-access system) are not well-maintained (e.g., re-
quests to view WHOIS data are usually rejected [25]), we
expect many security applications have to be re-designed. To
quantify such impact, we survey 51 security papers published
at ﬁve conferences in the past 15 years that leverage WHOIS
data. Among them, 69% surveyed papers need to use redacted
WHOIS information. We believe both the security and domain

community should work closely together to address the acces-
sibility issue of WHOIS data as soon as possible.
Finally, we have been reporting our ﬁndings to providers
containing non-compliant WHOIS records. We also discussed
with ICANN staff and a few registrars about the causes behind
their reactions to the GDPR. The lessons we learned are mainly
two: 1) the vagueness of ICANN’s instructions and the short
preparation time window (the ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation
was released only 1 week before the GDPR effective date)
forced many WHOIS providers to take the “safest” approach
and sanitize all records blindly; 2) the lack of checking tools
caused many ﬂawed implementations. The lessons suggest
enforcing privacy policies is still a complex task, requiring
more efﬁcient collaboration across communities. To contribute
to the communities, we develop an online checking tool based
on GCChecker and plan to release it in the near future.

● New methodology. We design a new system named

II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide background of the domain
registration hierarchy and WHOIS database. We then introduce
basic legal requirements of the GDPR, as well as its impact
on the current WHOIS system.
A. Domain Registration (WHOIS) Database
As shown in Figure 1, the domain name space is man-
aged by registries and registrars in a hierarchical structure.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN) creates Top-Level Domains (TLDs, e.g., .com) and
delegates them to registries (e.g., Verisign) which operate
the TLD zones. Registries then delegate customer service
to registrars (e.g., GoDaddy) which sell domain names to
registrants (or domain holders). All registrars and registries
of generic TLDs (gTLD) are contracted with ICANN under
the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) [2] and Registry
Agreement (RA) [6].
Domain registration data. As required by policies of the
RAA, registrars collect and retain in their databases both
technical information (e.g., name of the authoritative servers)

and contact information (e.g., registrant information) of their
sponsoring domains. Speciﬁcally, contact information includes
the registrant’s name, postal address, email address and tele-
phone number, as well as the administrative contact (the agent
technical
appointed by the registrant or his/her company),
contact (the person responsible for maintaining the author-
itative servers) and billing contact (the person responsible
for paying the domain’s renewal fees). When a Second-Level
Domain (SLD) is registered, the registrar also submits a copy
of the registration data to upper-level registries in a model
called “thick WHOIS” [7], unless the SLD is under three
TLDs: .com, .net and .jobs. For the three TLDs, contact
information is only retained by registrars (the model is called
“thin WHOIS”), but
they are expected to move to “thick
WHOIS” by the end of 2020 [12]. According to their contracts
with ICANN, both registrars and registries should offer free
query-based access to their registration databases.
WHOIS: the lookup protocol of registration data. RFC
3912 [40] speciﬁes the WHOIS protocol as the standard
interface to query the domain registration database. To look
up the registration data (or WHOIS record) of a domain, a
WHOIS client sends a TCP request with the domain name to
port 43 of WHOIS servers of the domain’s sponsoring registrar
and registry. Alternatively, the client user can also visit the web
interfaces of WHOIS providers to fetch the WHOIS record.
WHOIS data is maintained in a semi-structured textual format
but the format is inconsistent across WHOIS providers [70],
which makes it challenging to parse at scale. Section III-A
describes how we handle the collected WHOIS records.
B. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Regulation
Protection
(EU)
The General Data
2016/679 [5], or GDPR,
is a data protection regulation
designed to “harmonize” privacy laws of the EU member
countries. Recital 6 [4] says the GDPR aims to provide a
high-level framework about protecting personal data when
the data ﬂows within the (European) Union and out to other
countries. Repealing the former Directive 95/46/EC [1], the
GDPR was adopted in April 2016 and ofﬁcially went into
effect on 25 May 2018. Below we highlight its key legal
requirements.
Processing personal data. Article 4 of the GDPR deﬁnes
personal data as “any information relating to an identiﬁed
or identiﬁable natural person”. As a result, names, location
data and online identiﬁers (e.g., email addresses, IP addresses
and browser cookies) are considered as personal data. It also
deﬁnes processing as “any operation or set of operations which
is performed on personal data”, including collection, storage
and disclosure.
Consent from user. Article 6 of the GDPR ensures the rights
of data subjects in controlling their data. In particular, data
subjects can “give consent to the processing of his or her
personal data for one or more speciﬁc purposes”. Note that
data protection is enforced by default, thus silence from the
data subjects means no consent [8].
Territorial scope. Article 3 of the GDPR deﬁnes its territorial
