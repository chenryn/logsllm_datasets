### Malware Detection Techniques
| Type                  | Scope                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Signature-based       | Byte sequence, List of DLL, Assembly Instruction |
| Behavior-based        | API Calls, System calls, CFG, Instruction trace, n-gram, Sandbox |
| Heuristic-based       | API Calls, System call, CFG, Instruction trace, List of DLL, Hybrid features, n-gram |
| Cloud-based           | Strings, System calls, Hybrid features, n-gram   |
| Learning-based        | API Calls, System call, Hybrid features          |

### Challenges in Malware Detection
- **Signature-based:**
  - Requires a large database.
  - Difficulty in detecting obfuscated samples.
  - Continuous updates by vendors are resource-intensive.
- **Behavior-based:**
  - Requires execution, posing a risk of zero-day exploits.
  - Time-consuming and labor-intensive.
  - Behavior policies can be bypassed.
- **Heuristic-based:**
  - Combines the challenges of both signature and behavior-based methods.
- **Cloud-based:**
  - Reliance on internet connectivity adds delay.
  - Less effective at monitoring and detecting heuristics.
- **Learning-based:**
  - Training datasets may not cover all variants.
  - Difficulty in identifying new or obfuscated malware.

- **Semantics-Aware Malware Detection (S&P'05):**
  - Lightweight malware template based on data reference relationships.
  - Efficiently detects similar behaviors in mutated code.
  - Zero false positives.
  - Current limitations: Conceptual framework without an available engine or source code.

### Demonstration
- **CRC32 & DLL ReflectiveLoader**
- **Process Hollowing**
- **Ransomware Detection**

### Future Works and Closing Remarks
- Ongoing research and development.
- Future enhancements and applications.
- Concluding thoughts and Q&A.
