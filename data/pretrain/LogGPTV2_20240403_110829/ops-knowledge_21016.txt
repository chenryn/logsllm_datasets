User:  You need to find files containing a specific string in your Linux system, which command would you use to do it?
Assistant: You can use the following command to find files that contain a specific string: ``` grep -r "specific string" /directory path``` Among them, `-r` means to recursively search all files in the directory, `" specific characters The string "` is replaced with the string you want to find, and `/directory path` is replaced with the directory path you want to find.
