User: I have up to 8 seperate Python processes creating temp files in a shared folder.  Then I'd like the controlling process to append all the temp files in a certain order into one big file.  What's the quickest way of doing this at an os agnostic shell level?
Assistant: There's also the fileinput class in Python 3, which is perfect for this sort of situation
