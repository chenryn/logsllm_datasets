We ﬁrst need to decide which ASes to secure. Ideally, we
could choose the smallest set of ASes that maximizes the
value of the metric. To formalize this, consider the follow-
ing computational problem, that we call “Max-k-Security”:
Given an AS graph, a speciﬁc attacker-destination pair (m, d),
and a parameter k > 0, ﬁnd a set S of secure ASes of size k
that maximizes the total number of happy ASes. Then:
Theorem 5.1. Max-k-Security is NP-hard in all three rout-
ing policy models.
The proof is in Appendix I. This result can be extended to
the problem of choosing the set of secure ASes that maximize
the number of happy ASes over multiple attacker-destination
pairs (which is what our metric computes).
5.2 Large partial deployments.
Instead of focusing on choosing the optimum set S of ASes
to secure (an intractable feat), we will instead consider a few
partial deployment scenarios among high-degree ASes S, as
suggested in practice [44] and in the literature [6, 11, 19].
Non-stub attackers. We now suppose that the set of at-
tackers is the set of non-stub ASe in our graph M(cid:48) (i.e., not
“Stubs” or “Stubs-x” per Table 1). Ruling out stub ASes is
consistent with the idea that stubs cannot launch attacks if

ity that can be achieved via IRRs [1] or even the RPKI [41],
and does not require S*BGP.
Security across all destinations.
5.2.1
Gill et al. [19] suggest bootstrapping S*BGP deployment
by having secure ISPs deploy S*BGP in their customers that
are stub ASes. We therefore consider this “rollout”:
Tier 1 & Tier 2 rollout.
Other than the empty set,
we consider three diﬀerent secure sets. We secure X Tier
1’s and Y Tier 2’s and all of their stubs, where (X, Y ) ∈
{(13, 13), (13, 37), (13, 100)}; this corresponds to securing about
33%, 40%, and 50% of the AS graph.
The results are shown in Figure 7(a), which plots, for each
routing policy model, the increase in the upper- and lower
bound on HM(cid:48),V (S) (Section 4.1) for each set S of secure
ASes in the rollout (y-axis), versus the number of non-stub
ASes in S (x-axis). We make a few important observations:
Tiebreaking can seal an AS’s fate. Even with a large
deployment of S*BGP, the improvement in security is highly
dependent on the vagarities of the intradomain tiebreaking
criteria used to decide between insecure routes. (See also
Section 4.1’s discussion on tiebreaking.) Even when we se-
cure 50% of ASes in the security 1st model (the last step
of our rollout), there is still a gap of more than 10% be-
tween the lower and upper bounds of our metric. Thus,
in a partial S*BGP deployment, there is a large fraction of
ASes that are balanced on a knife’s edge between an inse-
cure legitimate route and an insecure bogus route; only the
(unknown-to-us) intradomain routing policies of these ASes
can save them from attack. This is inherent to any partial
deployment of S*BGP, even in the security 1st model.
Meagre improvements even when security is 2nd. As
expected, the biggest improvements come in the security
1st model, where ASes make security their highest priority
and deprecate all economic and operational considerations.
When security is 1st and 50% of the AS graph is secure
(at the last step in the rollout), the improvement over the
baseline scenario is signiﬁcant; about 24%. While we might
hope that the security 2nd model would present improve-
ments that are similar to those achieved when security is
1st, this is unfortunately not the case. In both the security

HM(cid:48),C (∅) for each step in the rollout. The x-axis
is the number of non-stub, non-CP ASes in S.
2nd and 3rd models we see similarly disappointing increases
in our metric. We explain this observation in Section 6.2.
5.2.2 Focus on the content providers?
Since much of the Internet’s traﬃc originates at the con-
tent providers (CPs), we might consider the impact of S*BGP
deployment on CPs only. We considered the same rollout
as above, but with all 17 CPs secure, and computed the
metric over CP destinations only, i.e., HM(cid:48),CP (S). The re-
sults, presented in Figure 8, are very similar to those in
Figure 7(a): improvements of at least 26% 9.4%, and 4% for
