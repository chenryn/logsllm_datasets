To secure the Internet, we must first determine which Autonomous Systems (ASes) to protect. Ideally, we aim to select the smallest set of ASes that maximizes our security metric. To formalize this, we define a computational problem called "Max-k-Security": Given an AS graph, a specific attacker-destination pair (m, d), and a parameter k > 0, find a set S of k secure ASes that maximizes the total number of protected ASes.

**Theorem 5.1:** Max-k-Security is NP-hard in all three routing policy models. The proof is detailed in Appendix I. This result can be extended to the problem of selecting the set of secure ASes that maximizes the number of protected ASes over multiple attacker-destination pairs, as computed by our metric.

### 5.2 Large Partial Deployments

Instead of focusing on the intractable task of choosing the optimal set S of ASes to secure, we will consider partial deployment scenarios among high-degree ASes, as suggested in both practice [44] and literature [6, 11, 19].

#### Non-stub Attackers
We assume that the set of attackers consists of non-stub ASes in our graph M' (i.e., not "Stubs" or "Stubs-x" per Table 1). Excluding stub ASes is consistent with the idea that stubs cannot launch attacks if their providers perform prefix filtering [10, 22], a functionality achievable via Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) [1] or the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [41], and does not require S*BGP.

#### Security Across All Destinations
Gill et al. [19] suggest bootstrapping S*BGP deployment by having secure ISPs deploy S*BGP in their customer stub ASes. We therefore consider the following "rollout":

**Tier 1 & Tier 2 Rollout:**
- We secure X Tier 1 ASes and Y Tier 2 ASes, along with all their stubs, where (X, Y) ∈ {(13, 13), (13, 37), (13, 100)}. This corresponds to securing approximately 33%, 40%, and 50% of the AS graph.

The results are shown in Figure 7(a), which plots, for each routing policy model, the increase in the upper and lower bounds on HM',V(S) (Section 4.1) for each set S of secure ASes in the rollout (y-axis) versus the number of non-stub ASes in S (x-axis). Key observations include:

- **Tiebreaking Can Seal an AS’s Fate:** Even with a large S*BGP deployment, security improvements are highly dependent on the intradomain tiebreaking criteria used to decide between insecure routes. In a partial S*BGP deployment, a significant fraction of ASes remains vulnerable, with their fate determined by unknown intradomain routing policies.
- **Meagre Improvements When Security is 2nd:** The most significant improvements occur in the security 1st model, where ASes prioritize security over economic and operational considerations. When 50% of the AS graph is secure, the improvement over the baseline is about 24%. However, in the security 2nd and 3rd models, the increases are disappointingly small, as explained in Section 6.2.

### 5.2.2 Focus on Content Providers

Given that much of the Internet's traffic originates from content providers (CPs), we also consider the impact of S*BGP deployment on CPs only. We use the same rollout as above, but with all 17 CPs secure, and compute the metric over CP destinations, i.e., HM',CP(S). The results, presented in Figure 8, show similar trends: improvements of at least 26%, 9.4%, and 4% for different steps in the rollout.
