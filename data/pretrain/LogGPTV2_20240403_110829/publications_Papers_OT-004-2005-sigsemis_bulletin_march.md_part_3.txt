A decade of experience with research proposals as well as standardized query languages for the conventional
Web and the recent emergence of query languages for the Semantic Web call for a reconsideration of design
principles for Web and Semantic Web query languages. This paper argues that a new generation of versatile

Web query languages is needed for solving the challenges posed by the changing Web. It also suggests that
well-known referential transparency and novel answer-closedness are essential features of versatile query
languages. The paper mentions that the decentralized and heterogeneous nature of the Web requires
incomplete data specifications (or incomplete queries) and incomplete data selections (or incomplete answers);
the form-like query can be specified without precise knowledge of the queried data, and answers can be
restricted to contain only an excerpt of the queried data.

PAPER TWO:
A Layered Model for Building Ontology Translation Systems
Oscar Corcho, Intelligent Software Components, Spain
Asunciσn Gσmez-Pιrez, Universidad Politιcnica de Madrid, Spain
In this paper, the authors present a model for building ontology translation systems between ontology
languages and/or ontology tools, where translation decisions are defined at four different layers: lexical,
syntax, semantic, and pragmatic. As part of this model, the authors propose a method that guides in the
process of developing ontology translation systems according to this approach. The method identifies four
main activities: feasibility study, analysis of source, and target formats, design, and implementation of the
translation system, with their decomposition in tasks, and recommends the techniques to be used inside
each of them.

PAPER THREE:
A Survey on Ontology Creation Methodologies
Matteo Cristani and Roberta Cuel
Universitΰ di Verona, Italy
In this paper, the authors provide a framework for analyzing the existing methodologies that compares them
to a set of general criteria. In particular, they obtain a classification based upon the direction of
ontology construction; bottom-up are those methodologies that start with some descriptions of the domain
and obtain a classification, while top-down ones start with an abstract view of the domain itself, which is
given a priori. The resulting classification is useful not only for theoretical purposes but also in the practice of
deployment of ontologies in Information Systems, since it provides a framework for choosing the right
methodology to be applied in the specific context, depending also on the needs of the application itself.

IJSWIS CFP Special Issue on
“Semantic Web and Healthcare Information Systems Interoperability”
Call for Papers
Special Issue of the International Journal on the Semantic Web and Information Systems on
“Semantic Web and Healthcare Information Systems Interoperability”
Issue editor: Vipul Kashyap (PI:EMAIL) and Asuman Dogac
(PI:EMAIL)
Submissions due date: TBD
Scheduled Publication date: TBD
The rising cost of healthcare is a great concern in the recovering US, European and Global
economies. There is an important and pressing need to
reduce costs of delivering healthcare and information technology is being viewed as a key
enabler for introducing efficiencies into the healthcare system.
The issue of building out a National Health Information Infrastructure is gaining a lot of
attention, with the approach being to encourage linking up of
local healthcare delivery networks across institutional, regional and health boundaries. We
invite original, high quality and complete research papers
that explore the role of semantics in general and semantic web technologies in particular in
addressing problems in the Healthcare IT industry. Topics
of interest, including but not limited to below are:
• Semantics and Computerized Physician Order Entry Systems
• Semantics-based Electronic Patient Record
• Semantics-based representation of Clinical Guidelines
• Controlled Terminologies, Ontologies and Information Models
• Semantics-based Clinical Decision Support
• Issues related to Translational Medicine and Clinical Genomics, including
- Mapping the Genotype to the Phenotype
- Data Models for storing combined Genomic and Clinical Data
• Clinical Knowledge Management, including Portals, etc.
• Semantics-based representation of Clinical Order Sets and Catalogs
• Semantic approaches for Enterprise Master Patient Indices
• Role of semantics in improving healthcare quality and improving patient outcomes
The time line for the special issue is as follows:
• Manuscript submission deadline: April 1, 2005*
• Notification of review evaluation: June 1, 2005
• Author revision due by: July 1, 2005
• Notification of acceptance: August 1, 2005
• Accepted manuscripts due for editorial review: September 1, 2005
• Tentative publication date: First issue of 2006
*We may accept delayed submissions (contact guest editors) which if accepted after normal
review process will be published in a regular issue later
Researchers are invited to submit original, high-quality, and complete research papers that
provide in-depth technical discussion of one or more of the above topics. Submissions (in PDF
or WORD format) should be emailed to Vipul Kashyap (PI:EMAIL) AND
Asuman Dogac (PI:EMAIL)

MTSR’ 05 First on-Line conference on Metadata and Semantics Research
[ http://www.metadata-semantics.org
Latest news: selected papers will be considered for journal special issues. More information in the call
for papers section.
The First on-Line conference on Metadata and Semantics Research (MTSR'05) aims at bringing together
researchers and practitioners that share a common interest in metadata, its representation, its semantics and its
diverse applications to Information Systems.
Concretely, a focus is given to four interconnected research areas: Semantic Web and Information Systems, Reusable
Learning Objects applications, Knowledge Management approaches in Information Systems and concepts, and
Cultural Heritage Metadata applications and schemas. The topics covered by the conference are not limited to these
four areas, but other "metadata and semantics"-related topics are also of interest.
The on-line format of the conference encourages demonstration of systems and prototypes and it enables the provision of
artifacts that are important for discussion like schemas, ontologies, learning objects or sample metadata records. The
commitment of authors to share their artifacts or implementations with conference participants will be supported by the
on-line conferencing system.
The Conference will publish on-line pre-proceedings to maximize the possibilities of virtual interaction and discussion.
Post-proceedings including all presented papers, extended to include the eventual results of discussion, will be published
by an international editor. In addition, best papers will be selected for publishing extended versions at several
International Journals covering the diversity of topics of the Conference.
MR'05 is sponsored by AIS SIGSEMIS and AIS SIGRLO (members will benefit from reduced registration fees).
Call for Papers
The First on-Line conference on Metadata and Semantics Research (MTSR'05) focuses on four metadata research
areas:

• Learning Objects (LO) concepts and applications.
• Knowledge Management (KM) approaches to Information Systems
• Cultural Heritage (CH) issues, schemas and applications.
Selected papers will be considered for inclusion in topical special issues in The Electronic Library and Online Information
