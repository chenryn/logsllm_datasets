### Description
Adding a user defined, small text `label` field to (mapped) task instances,
which would appear in the UI
### Use case/motivation
Currently it is difficult to differentiate between mapped tasks in both the
`Grid view` and the `Browse > Task Instances` view. It requires a lot of
hunting and pecking into either the parent XCOM to find what you need, or
individually clicking through the Rendered task view.
It would be helpful to be able to mark tasks with metadata at runtime in some
fashion, to distinguish in the UI
