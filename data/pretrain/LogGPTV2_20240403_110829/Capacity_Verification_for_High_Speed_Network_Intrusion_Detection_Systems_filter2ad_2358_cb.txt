attacks and normal background traffic. On one class B network with roughly 10
web servers, this approach successfully filtered out 95% of all remote-to-local
alerts.

1   Introduction 
Intrusion detection systems are not used in isolation. They are almost always used in
conjunction  with  defensive  mechanisms  including  frequent  installation  of  software
updates  or  patches  to  eliminate  known  vulnerabilities,  firewalls,  and  vulnerability
scanning  to  find  known  vulnerabilities  on  protected  machines.  In  recent  years,  the
cost and difficulty of using these defenses has decreased dramatically and they have
become  more  widespread.  Low-cost  personal  firewalls  are  available  to  protect

individual hosts. Scanners that catalog vulnerabilities in large networks have become
more  capable  and  comprehensive  with  almost  daily  updates  in  rules  used  to  detect
vulnerabilities. In addition, software patches have become easier to install and many
modern operating systems now  include  mechanisms  to  automatically  apply  security
patches  and  other  updates.  The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  assess  the  impact  these
defensive techniques have on the utility of network intrusion detection systems.
      This paper focuses on network-based intrusion detection systems that detect
known  attacks  using  separate  signatures  for  each  attack  and  on  the  use  of  these
systems  to  detect  successful  attacks  where  remote  attackers  compromise  monitored
machines  (remote-to-local  attacks).  It  was  motivated  by  anecdotal  evidence
suggesting  that  these  important  attack  types  are  rarely  detected  by  network-based
intrusion  detection  systems.  On  well-protected  sites,  network-based  intrusion
detection  systems  detect  scans,  some  denial  of  service  (DoS)  attacks,  and  failed
remote-to-local  attacks,  but  rarely  do  they  detect  successful  remote-to-local  system
compromises.  This  occurs  even  though  there  are  many  signatures  for  such  attacks,
there are 100’s to 1000’s of unsuccessful remote-to-local attacks per day, and analysts
spend hours each day examining alerts.
This paper has two goals. The first is to analyze how defensive techniques interact
with  network  intrusion  detection  to  determine  when  these  systems  will  detect
successful  remote-to-local  attacks.  The  second  is  to  demonstrate  that  knowledge  of
the defensive posture of a site can enhance the utility of network intrusion detection
by  reducing  the  number  of  alerts  that  analysts  must  examine  to  detect  system
compromises.
The  remainder  of  this  paper  first  reviews  important  characteristics  of  the  most
common type of network-based intrusion detection system. It also describes the use
of  firewalls  to  protect  internal  machines  and  to  isolate,  in  a  Demilitarized  Zone
(DMZ),  systems  that  offer  network  services  to  the  public.  Following  this,  the
importance  of  detecting  and  responding  to  remote-to-local  attacks  is  discussed  in
relationship to the utility of detecting and responding to other types of attacks that are
commonly  found  by  network  intrusion  detection  systems,  including  DoS  and
reconnaissance or scan attacks.
The concepts of “windows of vulnerability” and “windows of visibility” are then
introduced. These represent time intervals when protected hosts can be compromised
by exploiting recently discovered vulnerabilities and when these compromises will be
detected by network intrusion detection systems. A detailed timeline analysis follows
for eight important vulnerabilities. Each timeline indicates when vulnerabilities were
announced,  when  software  patches,  intrusion  detection  signatures,  and  vulnerability
scanner rules were available, and when vulnerabilities enabled major Internet worm
incidents.  The  implications  of  these  timelines  for  well-protected  hosts  in  a  DMZ
where  no  hosts  have  known  vulnerabilities  are  then  discussed  and  statistics  on  the
frequency  of  discovery  of  serious  vulnerabilities  are  presented.  These  show  it  is
feasible to update server software whenever serious vulnerabilities are discovered for
a small number of hosts. The implications of these analyses for poorly protected sites
and  for  normal  sites  with  many  protected  hosts  are  then  discussed.  The  paper  then
The Effect of Identifying Vulnerabilities and Patching Software         309
focuses  on  an  analysis  of  intrusion  detection  alerts  at  one  site  to  demonstrate  that
knowledge of known vulnerabilities for protected hosts can be used to prioritize alerts
and  focus  on  those  that  may  represent  successful  systems  compromises.  This  is
followed by a summary and discussion of further issues. 
2   Network-Based Intrusion Detection Systems
Network-based  intrusion  detection  systems  that  use  signatures  to  detect  known
attacks are pervasive because many hosts can be monitored by one intrusion detection
system and no changes are required on monitored hosts. Descriptions and evaluations
of research, commercial, and  open-software  network-based  systems  are  available  in
[13,15,18,25]. These systems rely on signatures or rules to detect known attacks by
comparing  the  contents  of  captured  packets  to  signatures  or  rules.  For  example,  to
determine  if  an  attacker  is  attempting  to  access  a  backdoor  file  left  behind  by  the
code-red  worm  [2],  the  string  “scripts/root.exe”  could  be  searched  for  in  incoming
traffic on TCP port 80. Signature-based systems normally do not detect new attacks.
In some instances a new attack may be detected using an old signature [13,15], but
this  appears  to  be  infrequent.  It  usually  occurs  only  for  attacks  such  as  buffer
overflows that exploit similar vulnerabilities.  A new attack is typically not detected
unless a new signature is developed for that attack and this signature is downloaded
and  installed  in  the  intrusion  detection  system.  Network-based  intrusion  detection
systems also often do not distinguish between successful attacks and failed attempted
attacks.  For example, for the above code-red backdoor signature, the signature may
create an alert whenever an external user attempts to execute the backdoor “root.exe”
file whether or not the executable exists or whether it runs successfully. 
The  evaluations  of  intrusion  detection  systems  referenced  above  noted  many
practical limitations of these systems including failing to match signatures when the
network traffic load is too high, producing many false alarms, and being vulnerable to
the insertion and evasion attacks described in [20]. The initial analysis in this paper
assumes an ideal intrusion detection system without these practical limitations. It will
be assumed that a network-based intrusion detection system issues an alert whenever
an  attacker  attempts  to  exploit  a  known  vulnerability,  that  there  are  no  alerts  for
attacks that exploit novel new vulnerabilities, that there are no false alarms, and that
after a new attack signature is installed, all instances of that attack are detected. 
The  initial  analysis  of  this  paper  also  focuses  on  secure  networks  where  internal
machines  are  behind  a  well-configured  firewall,  where  only  a  small  number  of
machines  in  a  DMZ  provide  public  networked  services,  and  where  a  network
intrusion  detection  system  monitors  traffic  between  the  protected  network  and  the
Internet.  This  configuration  is  common  at  many  government,  educational,  and
commercial sites. It also influences system administrators to be concerned most about
security  for  the  small  number  of  vulnerable  machines  in  the  DMZ,  instead  of  the
many more machines located behind a firewall.

3   The Importance of Successful Remote-to-Local Attacks
The three categories of attacks shown in Table 1 are generally considered  the  most
important  types  that  can  be  detected  using  network-based  intrusion  detection.
Remote-to-local or privilege-gaining attacks permit remote users to obtain privileges
they are normally denied. The most serious remote-to-local attacks provide attackers
with  root-level  privileges  on  Unix  hosts  and  Administrator  privileges  on  Microsoft
Windows  hosts.  Denial  of  service  (DoS)  attacks  deny  access  to  a  network  service.
Episodic  DoS  attacks  send  a  small  number  of  packets  that  induce  a  software  or
protocol  fault  while  continuous  DoS  attacks  consume  a  resource  by  sending  a
continuous stream of packets. Scan or reconnaissance attacks provide an attacker with
information  about  hosts  and  network  services.  Other  important  attack  categories
including “abuse of Internet privileges” and “poor security practices” (e.g. connecting
to  restricted  web  sites,  downloading  restricted  material,  using  telnet  instead  of  ssh)
are  not  included  in  Table  1  because  these  behaviors  are  site-specific  and  can  be
detected using traffic monitoring.
Table  2  shows  the  importance  of  these  three  attack  types  by  considering  the
potential  damage,  the  most  common  local  site-specific  response,  the  response  cost,
and  the  effect  of  the  response  on  other,  future  attackers,  who  launch  an  identical
attack  against  the  same  victim.  This  table  applies  only  to  known  old  attacks  where
software patches are available to prevent exploitation of the known vulnerability. The
first row of this table analyzes successful remote-to-local and episodic DoS remote-
to-local  attacks.  Episodic  DoS  attacks  are  included  in  this  row  because  they  have
similar characteristics to remote-to-local attacks.  
This  paper  focuses  on  detection  of  successful  remote-to-local  attacks  in  the  first
row  of  Table  2  because  these  are  the  most  damaging  and  have  enabled  recent
worldwide  Internet  security  incidents  including  many  worms  and  DDoS  attacks
[2,3,6,7,8,12,23].  As  indicated,  detecting  these  attacks  as  they  occur  allows  system
administrators to react by shutting down and cleaning up the compromised  systems
and  protecting  against  future  attacks  by  installing  software  upgrades  and  patches.
Such  rapid  action  can  prevent  theft  of  corporate  data,  monetary  loss  from  theft  of
financial information, and much longer down times caused  by  further  compromises

launched from the initial compromised machine. The dollar amount of losses due to
remote-to-local attacks reported in [19] is roughly 5 to 35 times greater than that of
DoS attacks depending on whether the cost of “Theft of proprietary information” is
added  to  the  cost  of  “System  penetration  by  outsider”  when  assessing  the  cost  of
remote-to-local attacks.  While these attacks can cause the most severe damage, they
are  also  the  easiest  to  prevent  from  reoccurring.  Intrusion  detection  systems  can
detect  the  initial  remote  connection  for  these  attacks  or  post-compromise  actions
including  communications  from  the  attacker,  attempts  to  compromise  other  hosts,
scanning  from  the  compromised  host,  and  packet  streams  sent  from  compromised
hosts participating in DoS attacks. Detecting the initial remote connection simplifies
the response and lessens the damage.
The  next  two  rows  in  Table  2  contain  failed  remote-to-local  and  failed  episodic
DoS attacks (often called probes) and scan or reconnaissance attacks. Both types of
attacks provide an attacker with information about remote hosts and network services
but  do  no  damage  to  the  victim.  Responses  are  also  often  ineffective  in  preventing
future  scans  or  probes.  These  attacks  are  ubiquitous  and  are  enabled  by  many
automated tools. Our experience on three separate class B address spaces, is that it is
common  to  observe  more  than  40  separate  scans  per  day  from  as  many  different
sources  with  from  hundreds  to  thousands  of  packets  sent  from  each  source  to  non-
existent  IP  addresses.    The  Snort  intrusion  detection  system  [21]  also  often  detects
thousands of remote-to-local attacks each day. On one well-protected DMZ, careful
hand  verification  of  these  alerts  demonstrated  that  all  were  either  caused  by  failed
attacks  or  normal  background  traffic.    Detecting  scans  and  failed  remote-to-local
attacks  provides  situation  awareness  and  sometimes  indirectly  detects  previously
successful remote-to-local attacks by identifying internal compromised machines that
are scanning external hosts. The often-suggested response of blocking packets from
external scanning or probing hosts may or may not be effective. It will block a novice
attacker who scans and then attacks from the same source address but not more capa-
312         R. Lippmann, S. Webster, and D. Stetson
ble attackers who scan from compromised machines. It will also not block an attacker
who  uses  public  lists  of  IP  addresses  to  find  target  machines  or  an  attacker  who
falsifies the source IP address for probes. A non-local response not shown in Table 2
is to contact the system administrator of the external scanning machine. This can be
extremely  effective  when  possible,  but  requires  identifying  the  location  of  the
scanning  machine  and  gaining  the  cooperation  of  an  unknown  administrator.
Detecting  probes  and  scans  thus  provides  some  situation  awareness  and  protection
from  simple  attacks  from  the  same  source,  but  it  does  not  usually  protect  against
future attacks of the same type from different sources.
Continuous  DoS  attacks  are  the  third  category  in  Table  2.    Distributed  DoS
(DDoS)  attacks  where  the  attacker  first  compromises  many  hosts  using  remote-to-
local attacks and installs agents that simultaneously send packets to one victim have
become  a  major  concern  in  the  past  few  years  [6].  Although  they  don’t  typically
damage  the  target  site,  they  prevent  others  from  completing  online  purchases  and
obtaining information and can cause loss of revenue [19]. 
Intrusion detection systems are useful to detect continuous DoS attacks, however
such  attacks  are  relatively  easy  to  detect  at  the  victim  by  traffic  monitoring  tools
including  many  tools  used  for  network  management.  Blocking  packets  from  the
attack  source(s)  stops  these  attacks.  Local  blocking  at  a  victim  site  will  stop  the
current attack but not necessarily prevent future attacks of the same type. More global
responses that involve modifying the Internet infrastructure can limit the severity of
these  types  of  attacks,  but  this  requires  cooperation  across  many  sites.  Intrusion
detection  systems  are  thus  not  necessary  to  detect  DoS  attacks  and  stopping  an
ongoing  DoS  attack  provides 
little  protection  against  future  DoS  attacks.
Alternatively, detecting the original remote-to-local attacks used to create a group of
agents can prevent these attacks. 
In  summary,  remote-to-local  attacks  are  the  single  most  important  category  of
known attacks that a network-based intrusion detection system can detect. They have
the potential to inflict the most damage and installing software patches prevents other
attackers from exploiting the same vulnerability. Detecting probes and scans provides
situation  awareness,  but  these  attacks  do  no  damage.  Detecting  continuous  DoS
attacks is important, but often possible without intrusion detection systems and does
not lead to as great a financial loss as successful host compromises [19].
4   Windows of Vulnerability and Visibility
The  ability  to  detect  and  respond  to  successful  remote-to-local  attacks  depends  on
details concerning when vulnerabilities are discovered and publicized, when software
patches or other fixes are made available and installed, and when signatures are made
available  and  installed  in  intrusion  detection  systems.  Figure  1  shows  the  primary
events that determine if successful remote-to-local attacks will be detected and two of
the  many  possible  orderings  of  events.  In  both  time  lines,  a  new  vulnerability  is
discovered and an exploit is developed that makes use of this vulnerability. After this,
