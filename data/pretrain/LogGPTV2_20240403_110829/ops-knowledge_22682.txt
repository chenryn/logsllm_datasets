Question: "In the context of networking, why would an engineer choose to use an IP address instead of a MAC address to enable communication between devices in different local area networks (LANs)?"
 "A": "Because MAC addresses are only unique within a single LAN and cannot be used to route traffic between different networks."
 "B": "Because IP addresses provide a 16-bit number that allows for more devices to be addressed compared to the 48-bit MAC address."
 "C": "Because MAC addresses are primarily used for encryption and message integrity within a LAN, not for routing purposes."
 "D": "Because IP addresses are used to identify processes within a machine, allowing for multiple connections per device on different networks."
Answer: A
