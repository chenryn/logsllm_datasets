User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Stop an unstoppable openvz container I have an openvz container that is NOT stopping with the standard vz tools. How can I kill it? I tried a VZ destory but that wont work.

Thanks

Assistant: Well there is a very tricky part... You have to sort out the init process of the VPS, and kill it, see: http://forum.openvz.org/index.php?t=msg&amp;goto=27976&amp;
But... In my opinion you just have one option and that is to restart the HN.

If a VPS get's froozen; look in your syslog if there are any kernel oops, most likely they cause the processes that 'hang'. Furthermore look at the user_beancounters of that particular VPS. Sometime it hangs when installing/upgrading software and if the VPS is not a production one, leave it. It will sort itself in time.
