Here are the steps to set up and manage a remote desktop connection on Windows Server and restrict access: Step 1: Enable Remote Desktop 1. Right-click the "Start" button and select "System". 2. Select "Remote Desktop Settings". 3. Check the "Allow remote connections to this computer" option. Step 2: Configure Remote Desktop Connection 1. Right-click the "Start" button and select "Run". 2. In the "Run" box, enter "mstsc" and click "OK". 3. Enter the IP address of Windows Server and click the "Connect" button. 4. Enter the remote access credentials and click the OK button. Step 3: Restrict the access rights of remote users 1. Open the Group Policy Editor. 2. Select "Computer Configuration" -> "Windows Settings" -> "Security Settings" -> "Local Policies" -> "User Rights Assignment". 3. Right-click the "Remote Desktop User" option and select "Properties". 4. Click the "Add User or Group" button, enter the user or group name to restrict access, and click the "OK" button. 5. Under the selected user or group, select the permissions that need to be restricted, and click the "OK" button. Through the above steps, you can set up and manage the remote desktop connection on Windows Server, and limit the access rights of remote users. It should be noted that if you need to remotely connect to Windows Server, in addition to enabling the remote desktop function, you also need to grant remote users access rights. At the same time, to ensure security, you should limit remote users' access to only the necessary permissions to prevent them from accessing sensitive information or performing inappropriate operations.
