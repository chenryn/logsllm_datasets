ABSTRACT
The existence of ticket scalpers is a negative impact to all perform-
ers, audience, and primary ticket sellers. Automated ticket scalping
bots, especially, generate serious damages to the online ticketing
systems, and cause an extremely unfair competition between ma-
licious ticket scalpers and normal users. However, little work had
been done to address this security issue and propose solutions. In
this paper, we will formulate this problem, propose an evaluation
framework to systematize some known defenses, and provide sev-
eral directions that can be further researched to mitigate automated
ticket scalping bots.

1 INTRODUCTION
The advent of online ticketing systems created enormous commer-
cial value by making people more convenient to acquire tickets
to various events, like concerts, art performances, or sport com-
petitions. Since popular performers have large fan bases, and the
number of available tickets is limited, users of online ticketing
systems have to compete for tickets by completing the purchas-
ing procedures faster as soon as the ticket grabbing event starts.
However, malicious parties will try to profit from these events by
snapping up a large number of tickets and reselling them; we call
them ticket scalpers.
Ticket scalpers are people who buy a lot of tickets, using illegal
or unintended actions, and sell them to others with much higher
price to profit. Before online ticketing systems appeared, ticket
scalpers had been scalping tickets by phone. After the advent of
online ticketing systems, ticket scalpers gained even more power
by using automated ticket scalping bots, which are low-cost, fast,
and can be simultaneously launched. In the OWASP Automated
Threat Handbook, the identity code OAT-005 defines scalping as
"obtaining limited-availability and/or preferred goods/services by
unfair methods" [7]. Automated ticket scalping bots contribute
significantly to the extremely unfair competition between ticket
scalpers and normal users. In fact, Ticketmaster once claimed that

Prestige Entertainment used automated scalping bots to lock up 40
percent of available tickets for the musical Hamilton [4].
To fight against ticket scalpers, major online ticketing systems
employ various kinds of defenses to stop ticket scalpers, such as
CAPTCHA, prior detection of suspicious accounts, throttling, Proof
of Work, and paperless tickets. However, most of the known de-
fenses are not ideal, for they have disadvantages in performance,
security, usability, and/or deployability aspects. Also, ticket scalpers
will constantly invent new techniques to bypass known defenses.
The race between ticket scalpers and sellers is never ending.
The goal of our paper is to formulate this problem, propose an
evaluation framework to systematize known defenses, and pro-
vide several directions that can be further researched to mitigate
automated ticket scalping machines.
2 PROBLEM DEFINITION
2.1 Online Ticketing System
The process of purchasing a ticket varies in different online ticket-
ing systems, but most of them share common important procedures:
authentication, quantity and seat selection, payment, and optional
bot detection tests. First, the users have to enter their identity infor-
mation manually, or login their account first. Then, they have to fill
in or select the number and kind of tickets they want to buy. Usually
the maximum number of tickets a user can buy is limited. During
the process, there might be bot detection mechanisms deployed at
either frontend or backend of the website that the users have to
pass. After completing these procedures, if the requested number
of tickets are available, they will be reserved for the users and they
can take their time filling in the mailing and billing information.
Figure 1: Sample ticket purchasing procedures
2.2 Attacker Model
We consider attackers that attempt to buy a large number of tick-
ets from primary ticket sellers through online ticketing system by
launching automated scalping bots. The bots are capable of complet-
ing the ticket purchasing process much faster than manual users, by
auto filling and selecting on the browser, or sending POST requests
directly to the server with user data. More advanced bots are even
able to break or bypass defenses, such as CAPTCHAs.
Poster Session ASIA CCS '20, October 5–9, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan931Note that there are many kinds of ticket scalpers, some may
collect their tickets by hiring a large number of labors with low
cost to snap up the tickets. However, scalpers not using automated
scalping bots are not included in our attacker model, since those
are more unrelated to the information security field, and pose less
threat to the online ticket selling service itself.
3 EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
Although there are many existing defenses in ticketing systems,
they do not seem to be effective. First of all, many existing defenses
are vulnerable to targeted attacks. That is, the attacker is often able
to bypass the defenses if he know what defenses are deployed. On
the other hand, although there are some secure construction of
CAPTCHA (complicated video-based or game-based CAPTCHA,
Google’s reCAPTCHA v3), they are not chosen for deployment be-
cause of performance or usability issue. When improving a existing
defense or developing a new one, it is important to strike a balance
between different aspects. Therefore, in this section we are going
to propose an evaluation framework.
The evaluation framework consists of three different aspects to
evaluate defense measures toward automated ticket scalping bots:
security, usability and deployability. A good defense measure should
be secure against attackers, effect user experience as minimum as
possible, and can be deployed on online ticketing systems with
reasonable cost and performance.
Figure 2: The evaluation framework
3.1 Security
A good defense measure has to be secure against attackers. The
security of a defense measure is evaluated by whether it effectively
stops attackers in our attacker model. That is, a defense is secure if
it can prevent all attackers from launching successful attacks.
3.2 Usability
A good defense measure should also have high usability, meaning
that it effects user experience as minimum as possible. We classify
usability into learnability, extra operation time, and false rejects.
Learnability evaluates whether users can understand the new ticket
purchasing procedure after the defense is applied without detailed
explanation. Extra operation time evaluates how much extra time
average users have to spend to complete the new procedure. And at
last, the number of false rejects produced by the defense measure is
also essential to user experience and fairness. The usability aspect
is included in our evaluation framework to require that defense
measures strike a balance between stopping ticket scalping bots
and preserving user experience.
3.3 Deployability
Deployability contains factors that ticketing system developers may
concern, such as performance, measured by queries per second, and
deployment cost. A major difficulty of ticketing systems is to main-
tain the stability of the system when the user requests burst in
during ticket grabbing events. Defenses with high performance can
prevent scalping bots from damaging the system while providing a
reliable platform for genuine users. Deployment cost is also impor-
tant to developers, depending on extra labor, server, development
cost, and also whether there are existing services to use.
In the following section, we will evaluate some known defenses
by the evaluation framework we proposed.
4 KNOWN DEFENSES AND EVALUATION
4.1 CAPTCHA
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Com-
puters and Humans Apart) provides a high level of security if well-
implemented. One of the common practices of preventing form
submissions by scripting is to put a CAPTCHA challenge to check
whether or not the user is a human.
However, from the perspective of users, some kinds of CAPTCHA
does not provide good usability, because they interrupt and slow
down the purchasing process. Some CAPTCHAs are even too com-
plicated that genuine users may fail in passing them, causing them
unable to reserve their tickets in time. This is why Google’s re-
CAPTCHA service continues to decrease the effort required for
normal users to complete in newer versions.
Google’s reCAPTCHA service is the most mature CAPTCHA
system. However, there is a quota limit even in its enterprise version.
This is why most online ticketing systems create their own cus-
tomized CAPTCHA systems. Nevertheless, self-designed CAPTCHA
systems are often more vulnerable, and fell short in the security
aspect. Due to design flaws, some CAPTCHA systems using graphic
codes are not complicated enough, which can be responded by deep
learning algorithms, or even naive pattern recognition algorithms
easily[8]. Developing an efficient and secure CAPTCHA system
can be a good direction to mitigate automated ticket scalping bots.
Some recent researches utilize adversarial perturbation, a feature
in machine learning that is imperceptible by human but results in
great misclassification error for machine learning models, to create
"adversarial CAPTCHAs" that fool automatic CAPTCHA solvers
[3] [5]. This might be a method to increase text and image-based
CAPTCHAs’ security without sacrificing usability.
4.2 Prior Detection of Suspicious Accounts
Ticketing systems could collect user actions and profiles such as
active client IPs, contact addresses, and verification of email and
mobile phone. Based on these information, it is possible to achieve
prior detection of suspicious accounts. For example, an account is
suspicious if its contact address is not in the same country as its
mobile phone or IP address. Although there are online platforms
which provide programmable SMS and email verification, this kind
of account-based detection still forces attackers to put more effort
generating reasonable profiles for the bot accounts. Nevertheless,
this measure fells short in security and usability aspects due to the

potential risk of not detecting carefully designed bots and blocking
some genuine users. However, this measure has an advantage in
that it doesn’t modify the ticket purchasing procedures, which
preserves user experience for most users.
There are some other proposed bot detection methods, like the
web honeypot technique [2] or using website fingerprinting [6].
However, currently they are still vulnerable to targeted attacks and
hence won’t increase much security.
4.3 Throttling
To mitigate unnecessary waste of resources, ticketing systems usu-
ally adopt a throttling controller, which is responsible for regulating
the rate of resource requests from clients. It is often based on the
client IP forwarded by the CDN provider, or based on the account
ID. Throttling is good at preventing waste of resources, but there is
usually an upper limit of maximum tickets that can be bought per
account, so resubmitting the form continuously will not increase
the chance of getting more tickets. That is why most of the scalp-
ing bots don’t repeatedly replay requests. Instead, scalpers launch
several bots to perform single form requests.
This method provides little security, but it possesses high usabil-
ity and deployability, because it enhances server performance by
filtering requests, and there are various mature throttling frame-
works nowadays that can be deployed directly.
4.4 Proof of Work
Proof of work (PoW) provides high security against attackers that
aim to launch a large number of attacks. PoW is a challenge that
requires the requester prove it spent enough computational power.
PoW is a good method of defending automated scalping bots, since
it takes high computational cost to launch lots of bots that all solve
PoW challenges efficient enough. However, users with inefficient
hardware will not be able to pass PoW challenges fast enough to
reserve their tickets. Different magnitude of computational power
in personal computers, mobile devices, and ticket vending machines
should also be taken into consider. Whether the usage of PoW is
fair in the ticket purchasing process is worth exploring.
A previous work [1] proposed a geographic PoW, which increases
its difficulty with the distance between the physical location of the
requester’s IP address to the location of the concert. The author
claimed that a concert tends to attract normal users living near the
concert. Also, ticket scalpers have to either accept large computa-
tional cost, or gather fake IPs or recruit workers near the location
of every different concert, both resulting in extra cost. Although
there are several problems in this scheme, continue researching for
schemes that discourage ticket scalpers while influencing normal
users as little as possible may be a promising future direction.
4.5 Paperless Ticket
Paperless ticket is a new form of ticket, where users bring their
identity and credit cards used to purchase their tickets to the concert,
and swipe for entry. Since paperless tickets cannot be resold, it is a
method that ultimately stops ticket scalpers. Although paperless
ticket is very secure, it has low usability and deployability. For
example, users cannot enter the concert if they accidentally filled
in incorrect information. Also, the time and labor cost needed to
allow all audience to enter increases significantly.
5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we formulated the problems of automated ticket
scalping bots, propose an evaluation framework to systematize
known defenses, and provide several directions that can be further
researched to mitigate automated ticket scalping bots. In the future,
we will research on new defense measures that perform better in
the evaluation framework we proposed. Our ultimate goal is to find
an ideal method to stop automated ticket scalping bots and bring a
fair competition back to online ticketing systems.
