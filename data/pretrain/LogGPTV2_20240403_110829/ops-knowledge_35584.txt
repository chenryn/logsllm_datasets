User: We have a decent set of unit tests on our code and those unit tests run in under 2 minutes. We also use TeamCity to do a build and to run tests after each check in.  However, we still get issues where a developer "forgets" to run all the tests before a commit resulting in TeamCity failure which if this check in was done at 6PM may stay broken over night.  
"Forgets" is a generic term, there a couple other common reasons why even remembering to run the tests could result in TeamCity failure. Such as. 
-> A developer only checks in some of the modified files in his/her workspace.
-> A file was modified outside of eclipse such that eclipse's team synchronize perspective does not detect it as dirty.
How do you deal with this in your organization? 
We are thinking of introducing "check in procedure" for developers which will be an automated tool that will automatically run all unit tests and then commit all of the "dirty" files in your workspace.  Have you had any experience with such process?  Are you aware of any tools which may facilitate this process?   Our dev environment is Python using Eclipse's PyDev plugin.
Assistant: In one of the teams I was working before we had an agreement that anyone who breaks the tests buys bacon sandwiches for the whole team the next morning. Its extreme, but it works perfectly!
