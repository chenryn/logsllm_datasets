7.2 Deposit dilemma for XCLAIM vaults
Vaults in XCLAIM provide a deposit in the currency of the issuing
chain to insure against a risk on the backing chain. Exchange rate
fluctuations are external events that affect the security assumption
of a vault fulfilling a redeem request. Sudden drops in the exchange
rate results in insecure protocol states where the provided deposit
is less than the value of the coin b on the backing chain. Hence,
rational vaults have an incentive to refuse redeem requests even
under the threat of having their deposit taken away. Further, vaults
have a private valuation for the outcome of the redeem protocol. If
a vault values the backing coin b higher than the required deposit,
the vault has an incentive to not fulfil the redeem request. XCLAIM
mitigates exchange rate fluctuations and, implicitly, the potential
detrimental effects of private information through staged deposits.

gas which is equivalent to around USD 0.07. We reduce the linear
complexity of the curate function (10) to constant by executing
the assignment of agents for the next round in the update function.
The curate function updates the round counter and activates the
mapping for the next round.
8 RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, Balance is the first reputation-based
system for the dynamic adjustment of cryptocurrency deposits.
There are three discernible strands of related literature.
The first strand relates to Token Curated Registries (TCRs) [37],
inspiring the layered aspects of Balance [34]. A TCR formally rep-
resents a set R in which elements n can be included in a set through
a token-based voting mechanism. A variety of different TCR types
have been proposed [10, 16, 34, 37, 45]. Notably, ranked TCRs RO
enable agents to vote on the rank (i.e. position) of an element in a set
of elements such that ni ≺ ni+1. Further, layered TCRs are a set RL,
consisting of distinct subsets where ∪n
i=1Ri = ∅.
However, while Balance takes inspiration from a ranked and lay-
ered TCR construction, TCRs require voting by individuals with
tokens, adding significant and potentially unwarranted complex-
ity [2].
i=1Ri ⊆ RL(cid:86)∩n
The second strand concerns reputation aspects of Balance. Yu et
al. uses a notion of reputation to define a miner’s power in terms of
its work performed over the lifetime of a blockchain, as opposed to
instantaneous mining power, in order to mitigate the vulnerability
of blockchains to 51% attacks, where an adversary momentarily
possesses more than 50% of the total mining power [52]. Another
system for reputation management in decentralised systems, but
this time for users of the system as opposed to miners, is [32]. The
mechanism uses cryptocurrencies to measure trust: using deposits
between different agents, the authors construct a web-of-trust like
architecture. Balance is different, creating only direct trust rela-
tionships between agents and actions are directly evaluated through
the agreements in a smart contract. Taxonomies of reputation based
systems [22, 23, 43] indicate comparators for Balance and other
reputation based systems. Balance is a quantitative as opposed
to qualitative trust system, expressing a reputation in terms of a
deposit factor. Reputation itself is accrued by agents through direct
experience, i.e. direct interaction with a smart contract. In particular,
there is no transitive reputation between peers: the trust that others
place in an agent does not confer trust onto the agent 13. Some
13One caveat is that in one sense trust is transitive across agreements, since an agent
may participate in multiple agreements within the same smart contract, retaining the
same deposit factor.
systems such as Pisa [35] do allow for transitive trust, allowing a
reputation to be indirectly established.
A third strand of literature is pursued by [7]. Seeking to guard
against losses of users’ funds by centralised exchanges [39], the
work focuses on providing a privacy-preserving system for proving
the solvency of an exchange, i.e. that an exchange controls sufficient
reserves to settle the account of each user.
9 CONCLUSION
Balance is an application-agnostic system, intended as an exten-
sion to existing cryptoeconomic protocols, that allows for the re-
duction of cryptocurrency deposits without compromising security.
By explicitly modelling agents’ utilities, we show that it features
an incentive-compatible mechanism that rewards agents for the
performance of desired actions by reducing their required deposits,
and therefore the opportunity costs of those deposits. Moreover,
we show that the addition of Balance increases social welfare. We
also implement Balance, integrating it with XCLAIM.
The primary motivating force for agents in our construction is
the expected reduction in opportunity costs for the agent resulting
from forgone returns on deposits. If we modify the assumption of
perfect competition in Section 5, such that agents receive a positive
payment from performing a desired action, payments p could also
constitute a motivating force. For protocols where a reduction in
the deposit is not practical or not desired by the protocol designers,
the factor in each layer could be used to calculate the payment. In
this case, the factor would increase with every layer so that agents
in the lowest layer receive a payment of p f1, where e.g. f1 = 0.6.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to use a
curated registry to enable dynamic deposit requirements. One ques-
tion that arises is that given v is private information, at what level
should deposits and factors be set such that the proportion of agents
who find it incentive compatible to perform desired actions is opti-
mal for the protocol (or society) as a whole? In addition, we plan
to explore different parameter configurations such as overlapping
boundaries and restrict the number of agents per layers, as well as
extend the model to cover probabilistic formulations of the specifi-
cation.
