User: Windows Task Manager lists all running processes in the "Processes" tab.
The image name of Python scripts is always python.exe, or pythonw.exe, or the name of the Python interpreter.
Is there a nice way to change the image name of a Python script, other than changing the name of the Python interpreter?
Assistant: You could use py2exe to turn your Python program into a self-contained executable with whatever name that you choose to give it.
