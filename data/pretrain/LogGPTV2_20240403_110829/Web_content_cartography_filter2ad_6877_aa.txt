## Abstract
Recent studies have shown that a significant portion of Internet traffic is delivered through web-based applications. To meet the growing demand for web content, large-scale content hosting and delivery infrastructures, such as data centers and content distribution networks (CDNs), are being continuously deployed. The ability to identify and classify these hosting infrastructures is valuable for content producers, providers, ISPs, and the research community. For instance, it can help quantify the degree of infrastructure deployment in the Internet and the replication of web content.

In this paper, we introduce Web Content Cartography, which involves the identification and classification of content hosting and delivery infrastructures. We propose a lightweight and fully automated approach based on DNS measurements and BGP routing table snapshots. Our experimental results show that our approach is feasible even with a limited number of well-distributed vantage points. We find that some popular content is served exclusively from specific regions and autonomous systems (ASes). Additionally, our classification enables us to derive content-centric AS rankings, which complement existing AS rankings and shed light on recent observations about shifts in inter-domain traffic and the AS topology.

## 1. Introduction
The demand for web content in the Internet is immense, reflecting the value users place on content [18]. Recent traffic studies [15, 12, 22, 27] indicate that web-based applications are highly popular. To meet this demand, web-based applications and content producers use scalable and cost-effective hosting and content delivery infrastructures. These infrastructures, referred to as hosting infrastructures, have multiple options for server placement.

Leighton differentiates between three options for web content delivery [24]:
1. Centralized hosting
2. Data-center-based content distribution network (CDN)
3. Cache-based CDNs

Options (ii) and (iii) allow for scaling content delivery by distributing content across a dedicated hosting infrastructure, which can consist of a few large data centers, a large number of caches, or any combination. In many cases, DNS is used by the hosting infrastructure to select the server from which a user will obtain content [20, 37, 7, 30].

The deployment of hosting infrastructures is dynamic and flexible, involving increasing the size of existing infrastructures, changing peerings with ISPs, and placing parts of the infrastructure inside ISP networks. Therefore, being able to identify and classify hosting infrastructures in an automated manner is a step towards understanding this complex ecosystem and an enabler for many applications. Content producers can benefit from understanding the footprint of hosting infrastructures to place content close to their customer base. For CDNs, a map of hosting infrastructures can assist them in improving their competitiveness in the content delivery market. For ISPs, it is important to know which hosting infrastructures deliver specific content and at which locations to make relevant peering decisions. The research community needs a better understanding of the evolving ecosystem of hosting infrastructures, given its importance as a driver in the evolution of the Internet.

As demand drives hosting infrastructures to make content available at multiple locations, identifying a particular hosting infrastructure requires sampling its location diversity. Previous work has attempted to discover specific hosting infrastructures extensively, e.g., Akamai [36, 35, 17]. Such studies rely on the knowledge of a signature that identifies the target infrastructure, e.g., CNAMEs in DNS replies or AS numbers. Labovitz et al. [22] inferred that a small number of hosting infrastructures are responsible for a significant fraction of inter-domain traffic. However, this study only observes traffic crossing AS boundaries, not traffic delivered directly from inside monitored ISPs. As a consequence, important CDNs such as Akamai, as well as data centers deployed inside ISP networks, are under-represented.

In this paper, we introduce Web Content Cartography, i.e., the identification and classification of hosting infrastructures. We propose a lightweight and fully automated approach to discover hosting infrastructures based on DNS measurements and BGP routing table snapshots. Compared to previous work, our method can identify and classify new and existing hosting infrastructures without a priori knowledge of their operation or deployment. To achieve this, we rely on the information that hosting infrastructures expose to end-users when requesting hostnames through DNS. We construct mappings between requested hostnames and IP addresses returned and cluster the hostnames into hosting infrastructures using network information such as IP addresses, prefixes, and AS numbers.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
- **Identification of Hosting Infrastructures:** We propose a lightweight and fully automated approach to discover hosting infrastructures based on DNS measurements and BGP routing table snapshots.
- **Classification of Hosting Infrastructures:** We classify individual hosting infrastructures and their different deployment strategies based on their network and location footprint.
- **Content Replication:** We quantify the degree of content replication in the Internet and its impact on local content availability in different regions. We introduce the content monopoly index, which reflects the content an organization hosts, either replicated or exclusively hosted.
- **Revisiting AS Rankings:** We derive content-centric AS rankings that complement existing AS rankings and shed light on recent observations about shifts in inter-domain traffic and the AS topology.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We present our methodology in Section 2 and discuss our measurements in Section 3. In Section 4, we provide our results, and in Section 5, we discuss the implications of our work. We present related work in Section 6 and summarize the paper in Section 7.

## 2. Methodology
In this section, we describe our approach to identify and classify hosting infrastructures in the Internet. The key idea is to collect the IP addresses that DNS returns for various popular and unpopular hostnames from geographically diverse vantage points. We use this information for several purposes:
- To find the geographic location where popular content is available.
- To find the network locations (e.g., prefixes and ASes) where content is available.
- To determine which hosting infrastructure serves a hostname.

### 2.1 Design Goals
To achieve our goals of mapping content and identifying hosting infrastructures, we design measurements tailored to our specific needs:
- **Hosting Infrastructure Coverage:** We aim to cover popular hosting infrastructures in terms of traffic volume. Querying all possible hostnames is impractical due to the sheer size of the web. Instead, we focus on highly popular websites, which are likely to be responsible for a major part of today's Internet traffic. For example, Akamai claims to deliver about 20% of the total web traffic [30], and Labovitz et al. [22] attribute up to 10% of all Internet traffic to Google, more than 15% to the top 10 hosting infrastructures, and more than 40% to the top 100.
- **Network Footprint:** To sample the network footprint of hosting infrastructures, we run measurements from multiple vantage points. By running measurements from vantage points in different networks and countries, we benefit from the way hosting infrastructures use DNS to select the server from which a user obtains the requested content [20, 35, 36, 7]. CDNs rely on the network location of the recursive DNS resolver to determine the IP address returned by DNS [30, 28, 37]. Therefore, to sample the locations from which a given hosting infrastructure serves content, our approach relies on volunteers to sample from different networks, ASes, and countries around the world.

### 2.2 Network Features
The deployment of hosting infrastructures in the Internet is not homogeneous. We leverage the "network footprint" of hosting infrastructures to map them. The set of IP addresses returned for a particular hostname reveals the degree to which the corresponding hosting infrastructure is network-wise and geographically distributed. The natural features for our analysis are prefix, AS, and location of an IP address. For example, small data centers will be located within a single AS in a single geographic location, having a limited number of /24 subnetworks and a large number of IP addresses. A massively distributed CDN will rely on multiple ASes. These features are correlated and differ in their power to discriminate between different types of hosting infrastructures. We rely on both the granularity of BGP prefixes and /24 subnetworks. /24 subnetworks better represent the actual usage of the address space by highly distributed hosting infrastructures such as Akamai, while BGP prefixes indicate the granularity of routing and match the address space usage of centralized hosting infrastructures such as data centers.

To determine the AS for a given IP address, we use BGP routing information from RIPE RIS [4] and RouteViews [33], assuming that the last AS hop in an AS path reflects the origin AS of the prefix. To infer the geographical location of an IP address, we rely on the Maxmind geolocation database [29], which is reliable at the country-level [32].

### 2.3 Clustering Algorithm
Our goal is to detect where hosting infrastructures are located by AS and country and classify them according to their network footprint. The key idea is to cluster all hostnames that are served by the same hosting infrastructure, assuming that each hostname is served by a single hosting infrastructure. We are aware of counter-examples, such as Meebo, which runs its own meta-CDN, and NetFlix, which relies on both Level 3 and Limelight. Our approach accommodates such counter-examples by putting the respective hostnames into separate clusters.

By examining the resolved CNAME records for various hostnames, it is sometimes possible to identify the CDN that delivers the content. However, finding content providers would require an extensive a-priori database. In contrast, our clustering approach achieves the goal of identifying hosting infrastructures in the wild and could be used to help build such a database. Moreover, our agnostic approach can separate hosting infrastructures if they are maintained by the same administrative entity but treat various hostnames differently in terms of replication.

We present our algorithm that identifies hosting infrastructures based on our data. We choose a two-step algorithm:
- **Step 1: Separating Large Hosting Infrastructures.** The goal is to separate large hosting infrastructures from the rest. We rely on three network-based features: the number of IP addresses, the number of /24 networks, and the number of ASes a hostname is resolved to. We use the k-means algorithm [26] to partition the hostnames into up to k clusters in the feature space. Clusters with high feature values relate to widely-deployed infrastructures, while smaller infrastructures are found in the same cluster.
- **Step 2: Distinguishing Small Hosting Infrastructures.** The pre-clustering of hostnames does not take into account the actual network locations from where content is served but only features that reflect the size of the hosting infrastructures. The goal of the second step is to build sub-clusters within each k-means cluster by identifying the hostnames that are hosted on similar network locations in terms of IP address space. We define the similarity between two sets s1 and s2 as follows:

  \[
  \text{similarity}(s1, s2) = \frac{2 \cdot |s1 \cap s2|}{|s1| + |s2|}
  \]

  where |.| denotes the size of the set. The factor 2 stretches the image of the similarity function to the interval [0, 1]. The second step is performed for each k-means cluster separately. Initially, we put each hostname contained in the current k-means cluster into its own sub-cluster, called a similarity-cluster. We then perform a pairwise comparison of all similarity-clusters and merge them according to their similarity until convergence to a fixed point. At this stage, each similarity-cluster identifies all hostnames used by a single content delivery infrastructure.

  **Tuning:** Choosing k too high will split large hosting infrastructures into smaller clusters, while choosing it too low may result in significant overlap. We find that the interval 20 ≤ k ≤ 40 provides reasonable and similar results. We decide to choose k = 30. Extensive tests reveal that merging thresholds of 0.7 on the similarity between two similarity-clusters work well for the second phase of the algorithm.

### 2.4 Metrics: Content Potential and Monopoly
We propose metrics and rankings to compare the obtained hosting infrastructures:
- **Content Delivery Potential:** This metric provides intuition on the amount of content available for download in a geographic region or an AS. It is defined as the fraction of hostnames that can be served from either a geographic region or an AS. Values close to 1 suggest that a major part of popular content is available locally.
- **Normalized Content Delivery Potential:** This metric takes into account the total number of locations from where content is available. We calculate the normalized content delivery potential of a hostname by determining the weight of a hostname (1 divided by the number of all hostnames) and dividing it by the replication-count (the number of different ASes, subnetworks, or regions serving the content).
- **Content Monopoly Index (CMI):** This index distinguishes between locations (ASes, geographic regions) that have exclusive content and those that host replicated content. It is defined as the ratio between the normalized content potential and the non-normalized content potential. An AS with a large CMI hosts a large number of hostnames that are not available in another AS.

## 3. Measurements
In this section, we present our approach to collect traces, i.e., active DNS measurements, to evaluate our methodology. To identify hosting infrastructures, we compile a list of diverse hostnames and analyze DNS traces when resolving these hostnames as collected by end-users in commercial ISPs. Our experimental results show that our methodology can identify a significant fraction of hosting infrastructures' network footprints, even with a small number of well-distributed vantage points.

### 3.1 Hostname Selection
To obtain good coverage of the largest hosting infrastructures, we include the top-ranked ones according to Alexa [1]. Alexa determines its ranking by counting how many pages were visited by Internet users who have downloaded their toolbar. We also add hosts that are at the bottom of Alexa’s ranking to check for potential differences and to scrutinize replication of content for less popular hosts. Many web pages contain embedded content, such as images, videos, and advertisements, which the browser downloads from different servers. We take this into account by including embedded content and CNAME records. Overall, we keep the 2,000 most popular and 2,000 least popular hostnames according to the Alexa ranking, along with more than 3,400 embedded hostnames and 840 hostnames because of CNAMEs. This list leads to four subsets: TOP2000, TAIL2000, EMBEDDED, and CNAMES, respectively.

### 3.2 Measurement Approach
Our measurement approach relies on volunteers to run a program that collects DNS traces.
