As indicated by Table 4, the essential MoCA infrastructure, 
the ONT and router, were provided by the OSP. These are 
connected by either a coaxial cable via the main coaxial 
splitter, the method preferred by the OSP, or via a CAT-5e 
cable run directly from the ONT to the router. Even if the 
direct Ethernet WAN method is employed, the MoCA LAN is 
still available from the external coaxial splitter as the 
ActionTec requires its use to provision video and data feeds to 
DVR units in the home. As depicted in Figure 3, this 
propagation of the MoCA LAN to an exterior splitter provides 
an easily accessible position of influence for an attacker.

attack from outside the physical boundary 
To access the exterior splitter, the path to one of the 
connected 
coaxial 
cables 
must 
be 
interrupted, 
then 
reconnected through a splitter, as diagrammed in Figure 4. 
The other end of the splitter then connects in a new device, the 
MoCA-to-Ethernet adapter. This allows the extension of the 
MoCA LAN network and the introduction of a new Ethernet-
compatible device. To accomplish the break, the original 
coaxial cable was disconnected from the main splitter. A new 
splitter, the RCA VH606N, was introduced with a short RC-6 
coaxial cable. This splitter was then connected to the original 
coaxial cable from the home to complete the original circuit. 
The other side was then connected to the Netgear MCAB1001 
MoCA adapter via the second RC-6 coaxial cable. 
Figure 5: Color-inverted picture of components employed 
to split the coaxial connection and extend the MoCA LAN 
As Verizon does not employ the link privacy feature of 
MoCA for the LAN network, the MoCA adapter integrates to 
the MoCA LAN without additional configuration. Figure 5 
shows the successful integration of the 2-way coaxial splitter, 
additional RC-6 coaxial cables, and MoCA adapter to enable 
extension of the MoCA LAN outside the house. The picture 
was color-inverted to draw out the components and 
demonstrate the difficulty in spotting the components when 
viewed in natural light and color. 
Having gained access to the MoCA LAN, passive packet 
captures yielded Ethernet broadcast traffic but no IP datagram 
traffic. This indicates that the MoCA LAN, when reconnected 
to Ethernet on the ActionTec router, is bridged to a switch. 
This media-sensing device prevents the delivery of link traffic 
to all hosts, instead delivering addressed Ethernet frames only 
to the port associated to the indicated MAC or IP address via 
the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table [19][8, pp. 476-
482]. 
2)  Reconnaissance 
To discover more about the nodes attached to the MoCA 
LAN and its bridged Ethernet LAN, a more active approach 
was necessary to overcome the limitations established by the 
Ethernet switch. The following diagram depicts the normal 
FIOS routing operation. Data flows from MoCA LAN 
(DVRs), Ethernet, and Wireless devices to the same Ethernet 
switched router, then out over the MoCA WAN to the ONT.

The switch, as an OSI layer 2 device, was subjected to an 
ARP poisoning attack using the Ettercap attack suite [20][21]. 
ARP poisoning is the injection of ARP broadcast traffic to 
notify all hosts on an Ethernet network that an assigned IP 
address on the network is associated to a MAC address 
[22][23]. The attack promulgated false information to the 
MoCA   LAN’s   bridged   Ethernet   network   to   associate   the  
ActionTec  router’s  gateway  IP  address  to  the  attacking laptop 
computer’s  MAC  address.  Once  propagated,  all  nodes on the 
network communicated to the attacking laptop as the gateway. 
With the laptop configured to forward IP datagrams (in 
Ubuntu, ipv4_forward=true), a static gateway setting to the 
ActionTec gateway IP address, and a statically defined entry 
in the local ARP table for the ActionTec router, the entire 
network was subverted to route traffic through the attacking 
laptop.

ARP poisoning was the method of attack chosen to 
illustrate the weakness of running the internal MoCA LAN 
across a physically external hub. However, ARP poisoning is 
rather noisy and leaves detectable traces that can be captured 
by monitoring services [24]. While few of these detection 
tools would  be  running  upon  a  typical  household’s  LAN,  the  
ActionTec router also proved fallible to ARP table 
manipulation, eventually corrupting the ARP table beyond use 
and rendering the ActionTec-supported LAN unroutable. 
While ARP poisoning provides a quick and easy method to 
discover assets on the LAN in a short time, there is the 
potential to incur a fault that will be noticed by the user.  
A DHCP spoofing attack would be more stable and less 
noisy, but requires the attacker to wait for DHCP leases to be 
renewed on the network [25]. Currently there are no logging 
systems available to record DHCP spoofing unless a network 
intrusion detection system is specifically instrumented to 
detect rogue DHCP packets or IP collisions are detected on 
the network, which should not happen under a single DHCP 
scope. However, this method requires the attacker to invest 
more time in asset discovery and reliably win the race 
condition between the responding legitimate and rogue DHCP 
services. 
With both access to and command of the routing within the 
household LAN, the attacker can efficiently collect 
authentication information, commit deep packet inspection, 
profile all machines on the network to plan further intrusion, 
and   collect   information   about   the   user’s   common   activities.  
The attacker may also come across private communications 
that the user engages in the privacy of their home, which may 
provide an opportunity for embarrassment or blackmail at a 
later time.  
3)  Exploitation 
With OSI layers 2 and 3 of the local network under the 
attacker’s  control,  the  higher  layers  of  the  OSI  stack  become 
vulnerable to observation, redirection, interference, or 
injection. The MoCA LAN bridge extended the Ethernet 
private LAN outside of the home, negating the firewall and 
network address translation (NAT) barriers established by the 
ActionTec router to any attacker that can walk up and plug in 
[8,  pp. 349-352]. 
The attacker can take a couple of paths to exploiting 
discovered machines running on a network bridged to a 
MoCA LAN. Once a target host is identified, the attacker can 
engage in a direct attack, such as DNS response forgery, to 
redirect a target from their intended destination to the 
attacking host or website. This enables the attacker to engage 
in attacks germane to the host in question, but leave other 
hosts alone, which reduces the likelihood of detection. Tools 
like Metasploit can also aid in direct attacks, attempting to 
take advantage of known vulnerabilities   in   a   profiled   host’s  
offered services to gain illicit access to the machine [26].  
4)  Deepening the foothold 
With control of DNS and the traffic routing, the attacker 
can then engage in more subversive, less detectable attacks. 
These indirect attacks operate by injecting malicious scripts 
and binaries into portions of traffic streams. Because most of 
the stream is legitimate and the hosts are specifically targeted 
based on known profiles, this allows for quiet, highly likely 
compromise of the target machine. For example, the Browser 
Exploitation Framework (BeEF) could be employed to inject a 
malicious javascript into a web request for a common website 
[27][28][29]. Exploitation frameworks, such as EvilGrade, 
have been combined with active attack tools to produce highly 
effective exploitation frameworks, such as Karmetasploit 
[30][31].  
5)  Persistent pestilence 
Utilizing these powerful tools, the attacker can create 
alternate   means   of   access,   such   as   reverse   ‘administration’  
tools (RATs) that call out and provide command-and-control 
from  the  attacker’s  points  of  presence.  This  would  allow  the  
attacker to use the MoCA LAN attack as a first step for 
establishment, then disengage the physical attack after 
establishing  another  foothold  on  the  user’s  network. With an 
alternate control, the attacker can disestablish the MoCA LAN 
attack by simply removing the hardware. This allows for a 
time-limited infiltration mission to enable permanent 
establishment  of  remote  control  over  the  user’s  network.  This  
method further reduces the likelihood of detection since the 
tell-tale equipment only remains at the site for the time 
necessary to gain an alternate channel. Should the alternate 
channel be interrupted, simply reapplying the MoCA LAN 
attack hardware can re-establish  the  aggressor’s  control  over  
the  home’s  network.   
To further reduce observables, the attacker can utilize an 
embedded system rather than a laptop. Soekris boxes provide 
a compact x86 platform upon which to load the open source 
operating systems, libraries, and software that many attack 
toolkits rely on [32]. Taken further, the attacker could employ 
a commonly available hardware attack platform, the Pwnie 
[33]. Use of a generic device would reduce the amount of 
incriminating data available to implicate the attacker as most 
artifacts are common to the platform. 
Another variation of the attack would be to pair the MoCA 
LAN access with a Wi-Fi access point. Access points are 
simply Ethernet bridges to the Wi-Fi transceiver. This 
functionality can be easily established by plugging any 
commonly available Wi-Fi router to the MoCA bridge adapter 
via one of its own LAN switch ports [34]. The attacker can 
then access  the  home’s  MoCA  LAN  from  a  distance, out of 
sight of the attacked property. This attack worked well during 
the assessment, however the half-duplex nature of wireless, 
along with the limitations of propagation distance over the air, 
presented performance challenges when attempting to spoof 
responses to the much speedier MoCA LAN. 
6)  Detection 
Detection of a MoCA LAN attack can be difficult. As 
shown in Figure 8, the access points for utilities are 
commonly obscured. This provides ready cover for the 
attacker’s  equipment.  However,  the  ActionTec  router  provides  
some ways to detect a tapping aggressor. 
Under the Connection Configuration advanced menu, an 
interested user can find the Coax Connection Stats screen. 
This display presents a summary of all MoCA connections, 
including the MAC and associated IP address of each MoCA 
node. While this screen did display the IP address and MAC 
address of the MoCA bridge adapter, opening the screen is a 
manual process unsuitable for consistent monitoring. 
An easier indicator comes from the Network Status screen. 
This display is easily accessible from the initial dashboard and 
displays all LAN-connected devices, including MoCA nodes. 
The MAC reported was the bridged MAC of the attacking 
laptop’s   Ethernet   interface.   However,   the   network   indicator  
clearly   states   it   is   on   the   ‘coax’   network.   This   is   easier   to  
interpret, but may still be confusing to the lay user since most 
Blu-Ray and DVR units will appear in the same manner. This 
screen also requires manual access, making it unsuitable for 
monitoring. 
The ActionTec MI424WR also provides access to its ARP 
table from its Advanced menu. The ARP table displayed the 
attacking laptop and its Ethernet MAC connected to the 
‘Network  
(Home/Office)’  
scope.  
This  
indicates  
the  
transparent nature of the bridging done by the router between 
the MoCA LAN and Ethernet LAN layers. Again, this is a 
manually accessed screen and unsuitable for monitoring 
without a web scraping agent.  
The router also supports system and security logging. 
Disabled by default, the user can turn these options on from 
the Advanced menu under System Logging. A separate screen 
under System Monitoring displays the collected logs. While 
the log did record the attackers DHCP request and registered 
the  laptop’s  Ethernet  MAC  address  and  IP  address  issued,  it  
did not make any note of the ARP rebinding attack, duplicated 
IP address mappings of its routing IP, or the corruption of the 
router’s  ARP  table. These logs can be forwarded to a remote 
syslog server, enabling a more robust monitoring scheme with 
the necessary services and equipment. 
Figure 8: Demonstration of the obscurity of coaxial 
splitting outside the attacked home 
Due to the lack of effective logging of the ActionTec router, 
alternative methods of monitoring the MoCA LAN are 
necessary. However, since the MoCA LAN is employed as a 
simple bridging layer between Ethernet nodes, known 
Ethernet monitoring methods work to provide monitoring 
capabilities to the local LAN. 
Arpwatch is a tool that passively monitors ARP broadcasts 
for changes in the IP address allocations [19][35]. Employing 
this tool, the attacking ARP forgery attack and subsequent 
man-in-the-middle attacks were detected. At attack initiation, 
the  Arpwatch  logged  ‘changed  Ethernet  address’  alerts  for  all  
of the network nodes as the attacking MAC claimed all of the
