User: On doing 'which Python' it says '/usr/local/bin/python'. But when I go there through 'finder' there's nothing there. I can see /Library/Python through finder and on clicking Library/Python I see 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7.
The default Python currently is 2.7which I can see with --version. But all it has is /site-packages. How is this possible? I am not sure if it is the one that came with the OS or if it was installed later by someone. I am so so confused. 
OSX 10.8.4
Assistant: /usr and several other system paths are not visible in the Finder.
