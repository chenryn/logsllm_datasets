Hello,

Please see the attached screenshot.

I have encountered no issues when running the application on Windows. However, on Unix, using Atom and the TypeScript (TS) loader, I am experiencing errors. I suspect this may be due to a compiler issue. 

Windows is case-insensitive when handling file paths and strings, which might explain why the problem does not occur there.

Thank you,
