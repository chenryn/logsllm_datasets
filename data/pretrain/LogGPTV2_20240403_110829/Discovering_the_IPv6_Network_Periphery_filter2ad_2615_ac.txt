4.4 Consolidated Results and Seed Data Comparison
Although both probing campaigns began with approximately the same number
of target /48 preﬁxes in the ﬁrst probing round (130,447 and 111,670 in the BGP
and hitlist-informed seeds, respectively), only 9,684 /48s are common between
the two data sets. The number of target preﬁxes in common decreases at each
round, reaching 177 in /64 probing round. Only ∼1.6M (2.5%) last hop IPv6
addresses are present in both data sets. These results demonstrate edgy’s sensi-
tivity to seed input, and suggest that additional seed sources may aid discovery.
Of the top ten ASNs, only four are common between the two data sets – ASNs
852, 8881, 45899, and 45609. Of the top ten countries, however, six are common:
Germany, Vietnam, Canada, Brazil, India, and Japan, with Germany ranking
ﬁrst in both. While the US is the second-leading producer of last hop addresses
in the BGP-informed seed data with ∼6.9M unique last hops, it is fourteenth
in the hitlist-informed data with only 357,877 addresses. Finally, we consider
the last hop provider type using CAIDA’s AS type classiﬁcation [3]. By this
classiﬁcation, edgy’s results come overwhelmingly from transit/access networks
(99.9%) rather than content or enterprise ASes. This matches our intent for edgy
to focus on IPv6 periphery discovery.
4.5 EUI-64 Addresses
Previous studies, e.g., [7,16] identiﬁed the presence of many EUI-64 addresses in
IPv6 traceroutes, where the host identiﬁer in the IPv6 address is a deterministic
function of the interface’s Media Access Control (MAC) address. Our study sim-
ilarly found a signiﬁcant fraction of EUI-64 addresses, despite the introduction of
privacy extensions for Stateless Address Autoconﬁguration (SLAAC) addresses
in 2007 [24]. We discover slightly more than 16M EUI-64 last hop addresses,
identiﬁable from the ff:fe at byte positions 4 and 5 in an IID, using the BGP-
informed seed data, or approximately 42% of the total last hops. However, only
5.4M (34%) of the MAC addresses in these 16M last hops are unique.
The discrepancy between unique EUI-64last hop addresses and MAC
addresses appears to have two root causes. The ﬁrst is delegated preﬁx rotation.
Although 3.5M of the 5.4M unique MAC addresses observed appear in only one
last hop address, 1.9M appear multiple times. Of these, the vast majority appear
in only several addresses in the same /48, suggesting that the provider period-
ically rotates the remaining 16 bits of the network address portion [1,30,31].
We observe some providers rotating the preﬁx delegated to their customers on a
daily basis, and further examination of forced preﬁx cycling is a topic of future
work. The second cause behind the disparity between number of MAC addresses
and EUI-64 last hop addresses is due to what we believe is MAC address reuse.
14
E. C. Rye and R. Beverly
For instance, the MAC address 58:02:03:04:05:06 occurs in more than
266k BGP-informed seed last hop addresses in 76 /48s allocated to providers
throughout Asia and Africa. Because our probing took place over a period of
several weeks, we believe it is unlikely that a combination of provider preﬁx
rotation and mobility substantially contributed to these; its simple incremental
pattern in bytes 2 through 6 further suggest it is likely a hard-coded MAC
address assigned to every model of a certain device. Support forums indicate that
some models of Huawei LTE router [2,4] use 58:02:03:04:05 as an arbitrary
MAC address for their LTE WAN interface.
4.6 Comparison to the IPv6 Hitlist Service
We compare our results to an open-source, frequently updated hitlist [16]. In
mid-October 2019, the hitlist provides approximately 3.2M addresses responsive
to ICMPv6, and TCP and UDP probes on ports 80 and 443.
Both the structure and magnitude of the addresses we discover diﬀerentiate
our work from [16], which is unsurprising given our focus on ﬁnding addresses
at the network periphery. Unlike our results, the addresses in the hitlist are less
likely to be EUI-64 addresses. Only ∼441,000 EUI-64 addresses (with ∼338,000
unique MAC addresses) appear in the hitlist, representing approximately 14% of
the total responsive addresses. Figure 8 plots the normalized Shannon entropies
of the IIDs of addresses in our datasets compared with addresses in the IPv6
hitlist service. We see that the IPv6 hitlist contains a far greater proportion of
low-entropy IIDs addresses than the last hop addresses edgy discovers. As periph-
ery devices, particularly CPE in residential ISPs, are unlikely to be statically
assigned a small constant IID and instead generate a high-entropy address via
SLAAC, this reinforces edgy’s discovery of a diﬀerent portion of the IPv6 Inter-
net than prior work. Further emphasizing the complementary nature of edgy’s
probing, only 0.2% of the addresses we discover appear in this hitlist, indicating
that edgy discovers diﬀerent topology. Finally, while the last hops edgy dis-
covers overwhelmingly (99.9%) reside in access networks (Sect. 4.4), CAIDA’s
AS-type classiﬁer categorizes 1.8M of the hitlist’s IPv6 addresses as residing in
access/transit networks, 1.2M in content networks, and 48k in enterprise net-
works.
4.7 Comparison with CAIDA IPv6 Topology Mapping
We again examine a day’s worth of CAIDA’s IPv6 Ark traceroute results from
105 diﬀerent vantage points on Oct 1, 2019 [8], to understand edgy’s comple-
mentary value. Because edgy sends nearly two orders of magnitude more probes
(544M vs 8.5M), these are not directly comparable; however, we note that edgy
discovers 64.8M non-aliased, routable last hop addresses that CAIDA does not.
CAIDA ﬁnds 163,952 unique, non-aliased, routable last hop addresses. However,
despite focusing on only target networks that are dense in last hops, edgy still
discovers ∼25% of the last hop addresses that CAIDA does. Edgy similarly ﬁnds
87.1M links to the last hop address that CAIDA does not, but discovers 54,024
Discovering the IPv6 Network Periphery
15
of the 365,822 edges that contain only routable addresses from CAIDA’s prob-
ing. Edgy’s discovery of ∼37M unique periphery last hops from ∼544M targets
probed in the BGP-informed seed yields 0.068 unique last hops per target, while
the Ark traceroutes discover 0.019 unique last hops per target.
4.8 Comparison with Seed Data Source
Edgy, by design, extends topology discovery methodologies and is complemen-
tary to existing topology mapping campaigns. However, because we believe edgy
provides increased address discovery over existing mapping systems, we compare
the results obtained with edgy to the trace seeds used as input to edgy.
The BGP-informed seed source consists of traces conducted in August,
2018 to every /48 in the routed IPv6 Internet conducted from CAIDA’s
Archipelago [9]. These traces to ∼711M unique targets produce ∼5.8M unique
last edges and ∼5.4M unique last hops after removing non-routable addresses. By
contrast, edgy discovers ∼59.5M unique ﬁnal edges and ∼37.1M unique IPv6 last
hops by probing to ∼545M targets when seeded with the BGP-informed data.
Thus, edgy signiﬁcantly expands the discovered topology of an input seed.
Likewise, edgy discovers signiﬁcantly more last hop addresses and edges than
the hitlist-informed seed. The hitlist-informed seed discovers 434,560 unique last
hops and 656,849 unique ﬁnal edges, while edgy, informed by this data, discovers
∼29.2M unique last hops and ∼32.0M ﬁnal edges.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
We introduce edgy, an algorithm to discover previously unknown portions of the
IPv6 Internet, namely, the IPv6 periphery. Edgy extends and augments existing
IPv6 discovery mapping systems, and the last hop periphery addresses that it
discovers are nearly entirely disjoint from previous topology mapping campaigns.
Because of privacy concerns involved with EUI-64 addresses and the ephemeral
nature of many addresses, we are not releasing the periphery addresses edgy
discovers at this time; however, we expect our results to be reproducible.
Several topics are planned for future work. First, we observe service providers
that cycle their customers’ periphery preﬁx periodically. This rotation leads to
high levels of address discovery for these providers, but, based on examining IID
reuse, over counts the number of actual device interfaces present. We plan to: (i)
discover which networks implement high-frequency preﬁx rotation; (ii) quantify
the rates at which new preﬁxes are issued; and (iii) determine whether the preﬁx
issuing mechanism is deterministic and predictable. Second, we discover large
numbers of EUI-64 IPv6 addresses more than a decade after the introduction of
SLAAC privacy extensions [24]. Because edgy discovers periphery devices like
CPE, quantifying device types present in networks may be possible by cross-
referencing the models providers issue to customers, and through correlation with
protocols that leak model information [22]. Third, we wish to obtain more ground
truth information on the IPv6 periphery as well as explicit validation of our
16

results and algorithm. Fourth, we plan to improve edgy’s eﬃciency by training
it with historical data and leveraging multiple vantage points. For instance,
periphery networks that exhibit frequent customer preﬁx cycling may need to
be probed on a regular basis, while those with stable last hops may be re-probed
infrequently. Finally, because of the ephemeral nature of some of the addresses we
discover, we intend to couple other measurements tightly with address discovery.
For example, to further elucidate these addresses’ value, we will send ICMPv6
Echo Requests and capture service banners immediately after receiving probe
responses.
