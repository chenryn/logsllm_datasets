### 4.4 Consolidated Results and Seed Data Comparison

Although both probing campaigns began with a similar number of target /48 prefixes in the first probing round (130,447 for BGP-informed seeds and 111,670 for hitlist-informed seeds), only 9,684 /48s were common between the two datasets. The number of common target prefixes decreased in each subsequent round, reaching just 177 in the /64 probing round. Only approximately 1.6 million (2.5%) last hop IPv6 addresses were present in both datasets. These results highlight edgy's sensitivity to seed input and suggest that additional seed sources could enhance discovery.

Of the top ten ASNs, only four were common between the two datasets: ASNs 852, 8881, 45899, and 45609. However, six of the top ten countries were common: Germany, Vietnam, Canada, Brazil, India, and Japan, with Germany ranking first in both datasets. While the US was the second-leading producer of last hop addresses in the BGP-informed seed data, with approximately 6.9 million unique last hops, it ranked fourteenth in the hitlist-informed data, with only 357,877 addresses. Using CAIDA’s AS type classification, edgy’s results predominantly came from transit/access networks (99.9%) rather than content or enterprise ASes, aligning with our goal of focusing on IPv6 periphery discovery.

### 4.5 EUI-64 Addresses

Previous studies, such as [7,16], identified the presence of many EUI-64 addresses in IPv6 traceroutes, where the host identifier in the IPv6 address is a deterministic function of the interface’s Media Access Control (MAC) address. Our study similarly found a significant fraction of EUI-64 addresses, despite the introduction of privacy extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) in 2007 [24]. We discovered slightly more than 16 million EUI-64 last hop addresses, identifiable by the ff:fe at byte positions 4 and 5 in an IID, using the BGP-informed seed data, representing approximately 42% of the total last hops. However, only 5.4 million (34%) of the MAC addresses in these 16 million last hops were unique.

The discrepancy between unique EUI-64 last hop addresses and MAC addresses appears to have two primary causes. The first is delegated prefix rotation. Although 3.5 million of the 5.4 million unique MAC addresses observed appeared in only one last hop address, 1.9 million appeared multiple times. Most of these appeared in only a few addresses within the same /48, suggesting that the provider periodically rotates the remaining 16 bits of the network address portion [1,30,31]. We observed some providers rotating the prefix delegated to their customers daily, and further examination of forced prefix cycling is a topic for future work. The second cause is likely MAC address reuse. For example, the MAC address 58:02:03:04:05:06 appeared in more than 266,000 BGP-informed seed last hop addresses across 76 /48s allocated to providers throughout Asia and Africa. Given that our probing took place over several weeks, it is unlikely that a combination of provider prefix rotation and mobility substantially contributed to this. The simple incremental pattern in bytes 2 through 6 suggests it is likely a hard-coded MAC address assigned to every model of a certain device. Support forums indicate that some models of Huawei LTE routers [2,4] use 58:02:03:04:05 as an arbitrary MAC address for their LTE WAN interface.

### 4.6 Comparison to the IPv6 Hitlist Service

We compared our results to an open-source, frequently updated hitlist [16]. In mid-October 2019, the hitlist provided approximately 3.2 million addresses responsive to ICMPv6, and TCP and UDP probes on ports 80 and 443.

Both the structure and magnitude of the addresses we discovered differ from those in [16], which is unsurprising given our focus on finding addresses at the network periphery. Unlike our results, the addresses in the hitlist are less likely to be EUI-64 addresses. Only approximately 441,000 EUI-64 addresses (with approximately 338,000 unique MAC addresses) appeared in the hitlist, representing about 14% of the total responsive addresses. Figure 8 plots the normalized Shannon entropies of the IIDs of addresses in our datasets compared to those in the IPv6 hitlist service. The IPv6 hitlist contains a much greater proportion of low-entropy IIDs than the last hop addresses edgy discovers. As periphery devices, particularly CPE in residential ISPs, are unlikely to be statically assigned a small constant IID and instead generate high-entropy addresses via SLAAC, this reinforces edgy’s discovery of a different portion of the IPv6 Internet than prior work. Further emphasizing the complementary nature of edgy’s probing, only 0.2% of the addresses we discovered appeared in this hitlist, indicating that edgy discovers different topology. Finally, while the last hops edgy discovers overwhelmingly (99.9%) reside in access networks (Section 4.4), CAIDA’s AS-type classifier categorizes 1.8 million of the hitlist’s IPv6 addresses as residing in access/transit networks, 1.2 million in content networks, and 48,000 in enterprise networks.

### 4.7 Comparison with CAIDA IPv6 Topology Mapping

We examined a day’s worth of CAIDA’s IPv6 Ark traceroute results from 105 different vantage points on October 1, 2019 [8], to understand edgy’s complementary value. Because edgy sends nearly two orders of magnitude more probes (544 million vs 8.5 million), these are not directly comparable; however, we note that edgy discovered 64.8 million non-aliased, routable last hop addresses that CAIDA did not. CAIDA found 163,952 unique, non-aliased, routable last hop addresses. Despite focusing on only target networks dense in last hops, edgy still discovered approximately 25% of the last hop addresses that CAIDA did. Edgy also found 87.1 million links to the last hop address that CAIDA did not, but discovered 54,024 of the 365,822 edges containing only routable addresses from CAIDA’s probing. Edgy’s discovery of approximately 37 million unique periphery last hops from approximately 544 million targets probed in the BGP-informed seed yields 0.068 unique last hops per target, while the Ark traceroutes discover 0.019 unique last hops per target.

### 4.8 Comparison with Seed Data Source

Edgy, by design, extends topology discovery methodologies and complements existing topology mapping campaigns. However, because we believe edgy provides increased address discovery over existing mapping systems, we compared the results obtained with edgy to the trace seeds used as input to edgy.

The BGP-informed seed source consists of traces conducted in August 2018 to every /48 in the routed IPv6 Internet, conducted from CAIDA’s Archipelago [9]. These traces to approximately 711 million unique targets produced approximately 5.8 million unique last edges and approximately 5.4 million unique last hops after removing non-routable addresses. By contrast, edgy discovered approximately 59.5 million unique final edges and approximately 37.1 million unique IPv6 last hops by probing approximately 545 million targets when seeded with the BGP-informed data. Thus, edgy significantly expands the discovered topology of an input seed.

Similarly, edgy discovered significantly more last hop addresses and edges than the hitlist-informed seed. The hitlist-informed seed discovered 434,560 unique last hops and 656,849 unique final edges, while edgy, informed by this data, discovered approximately 29.2 million unique last hops and approximately 32.0 million final edges.

### 5 Conclusions and Future Work

We introduce edgy, an algorithm to discover previously unknown portions of the IPv6 Internet, specifically the IPv6 periphery. Edgy extends and augments existing IPv6 discovery mapping systems, and the last hop periphery addresses it discovers are nearly entirely disjoint from previous topology mapping campaigns. Due to privacy concerns with EUI-64 addresses and the ephemeral nature of many addresses, we are not releasing the periphery addresses edgy discovers at this time; however, we expect our results to be reproducible.

Several topics are planned for future work. First, we observe service providers that cycle their customers’ periphery prefix periodically. This rotation leads to high levels of address discovery for these providers but, based on examining IID reuse, overcounts the number of actual device interfaces present. We plan to: (i) discover which networks implement high-frequency prefix rotation; (ii) quantify the rates at which new prefixes are issued; and (iii) determine whether the prefix issuing mechanism is deterministic and predictable. Second, we discover large numbers of EUI-64 IPv6 addresses more than a decade after the introduction of SLAAC privacy extensions [24]. Because edgy discovers periphery devices like CPE, quantifying device types present in networks may be possible by cross-referencing the models providers issue to customers and through correlation with protocols that leak model information [22]. Third, we wish to obtain more ground truth information on the IPv6 periphery as well as explicit validation of our results and algorithm. Fourth, we plan to improve edgy’s efficiency by training it with historical data and leveraging multiple vantage points. For instance, periphery networks that exhibit frequent customer prefix cycling may need to be probed regularly, while those with stable last hops may be re-probed infrequently. Finally, because of the ephemeral nature of some of the addresses we discover, we intend to couple other measurements tightly with address discovery. For example, to further elucidate these addresses’ value, we will send ICMPv6 Echo Requests and capture service banners immediately after receiving probe responses.
