experiments, such remote feature extraction process re-
sulted in an EER of approximately 50%. We assume that
this is due to the change of acquisition antenna orienta-
tion and lower signal-to-noise ratio. We do not exclude
the possibility that other discriminant features could be
found that could be extracted remotely. However, this
does not appear to be the case for our features. After
obtaining the original ﬁngerprint, the attacker now needs
to produce or ﬁnd an RFID transponder with that ﬁnger-
print (i.e., such that it corresponds to the one of the origi-
nal document), which is hard given that the extracted ﬁn-
gerprints are due to manufacturing process variation. Al-
though manufacturing process variation effects the RFID
micro-controller itself, it is likely that the main source
of detectable variation lies in the RFID radio circuitry.
However, we cannot conclude with certainty which com-
ponent of the entire transponder circuit contributes most
to the ﬁngerprints. We leave this determination to future

is a challenging task in the lab, let alone in ”the wild”
environment of the attacker.
In the second use case, transponder ﬁngerprints are
measured before their deployment as in the ﬁrst case, but
are stored on the transponders instead of in a back-end
database. Here, we assume that the ﬁngerprints stored
on the transponders are digitally signed by the document-
issuing authority and that they are protected from unau-
thorized remote access; the digital signature binds the
ﬁngerprint to the document unique identiﬁer, and both
are stored on the transponder. When the document au-
thenticity is validated, the binding between the document
ID and the ﬁngerprint stored on the transponder is en-
sured through cryptographic veriﬁcation of the author-
ity’s signature. If the signature is valid, the stored ﬁn-
gerprint is compared to the measured ﬁngerprint of the
document transponder. The main advantage in this use
case is that the document authenticity can be veriﬁed
”off-line”. The main drawback is that the ﬁngerprint is
now stored on the transponder and without appropriate
access protection, it can be remotely obtained by the at-
tacker. Here, minimal access protection can be ensured
by means of e.g., Basic Access Authentication [3] al-
though, that mechanism has been shown to have some
weaknesses due to predictable document numbers [33].
As we mentioned in Section 5.4, our technique generates
compact ﬁngerprints, which can be stored in approxi-
mately 120 bytes. This means that they can easily be
stored in today’s e-passports. The ICAO standard [3]
provides space for such storage in ﬁles EF.DG[3-14],
which are left for additional biometric and future use;
transponder ﬁngerprints can be stored in those ﬁles. Our
proposal does not require the storage of a new public key
or maintenance of a separate public-key infrastructure,
since the integrity of the ﬁngerprints, stored in EF.DG[3-
14] will be protected by the existing passive authentica-
tion mechanisms implemented in current e-passports.
The closest work to ours in terms of transponder
cloning protection is the work of Devadas et al. [12],
where the authors propose and implement Physically Un-
clonable Function(PUF)-Based RFID transponders. Pro-
cessors in these transponders are specially designed and
contain special circuits, PUFs, that are hard to clone and
thus prevent transponder cloning. The main difference
between PUF-based solutions and our techniques is that
our techniques can be used with existing RFID transpon-
ders, whereas PUF-based solutions can detect cloning
only of PUF-based transponders. However, PUF-based
solutions do have an advantage that they rely on ”con-
trolled” randomness, unlike our techniques, that relies
on randomness that is unintentionally introduced in the
manufacturing of the RFID tags.
7 Related Work
Besides PUF-based RFIDs [12], that we discuss in the
previous section, the following works relate to ours.
In [41], Richter et al., report on the possibility of de-
tecting the country that issued a given passport by look-
ing at the bytes that an e-passport sends as a reply in
response to some carefully chosen commands from the
reader. This technique therefore enables classiﬁcation of
RFID transponders used in e-passports. Our technique
differs from that proposal as it enables not only classi-
ﬁcation, but also identiﬁcation of individual passports.
Equally, the technique proposed in [41] cannot be used
for cloning detection since the attacker can modify the
responses of a tag on a logical level.
The proliferation of radio technologies has triggered a
number of research initiatives to detect illegally operated
radio transmitters [44, 45, 23], mobile phone cloning
[30], defective transmission devices [48] and identify
wireless devices [20, 22, 43, 40, 39, 9] by using physi-
cal characteristics of the transmitted signals [15]. Below,
we present the most relevant work to ours in terms of
signal similarities, features and objectives.
Hall et al. [20, 21] explored a combination of features
such as amplitude, phase, in-phase, quadrature, power
and DWT of the transient signal. The authors tested on
30 IEEE 802.11b transceivers from 6 different manu-
facturers and scored a classiﬁcation error rate of 5.5%.
Further work on 10 Bluetooth transceivers from 3 manu-
facturers recorded a classiﬁcation error rate of 7% [22].
Ureten et al. [39] extracted the envelope of the instanta-
neous amplitude by using the Hilbert transformation and
classiﬁed the signals using a Probabilistic Neural Net-
work (PNN). The method was tested on 8 IEEE 802.11b
transceivers from 8 different manufacturers and regis-
tered a classiﬁcation error rate of 2%-4%. Rasmussen
et al. [40] explored transient length, amplitude variance,
number of peaks of the carrier signal and the difference
between mean and maximum value of the transient. The
features were tested on 10 identical Mica2 (CC1000)
sensor devices (approx. 15cm from the capturing an-
tenna) and achieved a classiﬁcation error rate of 30%.
Brik et al. [9] proposed a device identiﬁcation technique
based on the variance of modulation errors. The method
was tested on 100 identical 802.11b NICs (3-15 m from
the capturing antenna) and achieved a classiﬁcation er-
ror rate of 3% and 0.34% for k-NN and SVM classiﬁers
respectively.
In [11] the authors demonstrate the fea-
sibility of transient-based Tmote Sky (CC2420) sensor
device identiﬁcation with an EER of 0.24%. The same
work considered the stability of the proposed ﬁngerprint
features with respect to capturing distance, antenna po-
larization and voltage, and related attacks on the identiﬁ-
cation system.

8 Conclusion
In this work we performed the ﬁrst comprehensive study
of physical-layer identiﬁcation of RFID transponders.
We showed that RFID transponders have stable ﬁnger-
prints related to physical-layer properties which enable
their accurate identiﬁcation. Our techniques are based
on the extraction of the modulation shape and spectral
features of the response signals of the transponders to the
in- and out- of speciﬁcation reader signals. We tested our
techniques on a set of 50 RFID smart cards of the same
manufacturer and type and we showed that these tech-
niques enable the identiﬁcation of individual transpon-
ders with an Equal Error Rate of 2.43% (single run) and
4.38% (two runs). We further applied our techniques to a
smaller set of electronic passports, where we obtained
a similar identiﬁcation accuracy. We tested the clas-
siﬁcation accuracy of our techniques, and showed that
they achieve 0% average classiﬁcation error for a set of
classes corresponding to manufacturers and countries of
issuance. Finally, we analyzed possible applications of
the proposed techniques to the detection of cloned prod-
ucts and documents.
