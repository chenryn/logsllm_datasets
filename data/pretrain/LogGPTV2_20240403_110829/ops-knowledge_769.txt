This log chunk, spanning from 12-10 09:12:08 to 12-10 09:12:20, documents multiple failed SSH login attempts from the IP address 103.99.0.122. The key points are as follows:

1. **Failed Login Attempts**:
   - At 09:12:08, an attempt was made to log in with the user 'operator' from 103.99.0.122, which failed.
   - Multiple attempts were made to log in with the user 'admin' from 103.99.0.122 at 09:12:10, 09:12:12, and 09:12:16, all of which failed.
   - An attempt was also made to log in as 'root' from 103.99.0.122 at 09:12:15, which failed.

2. **Authentication Failures**:
   - The logs indicate that the authentication methods for these users (operator, admin, root) were exhausted, leading to a disconnect message: "No more user authentication methods available."

3. **PAM Authentication Logs**:
   - Several entries show that the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for SSH (sshd:auth) reported authentication failures. For example, at 09:12:10, 09:12:12, and 09:12:16, PAM reported that the user 'admin' was unknown and that the authentication failed.

4. **Summary**:
   - The log entries consistently show failed login attempts from 103.99.0.122 for the users 'operator', 'admin', and 'root'.
   - These attempts were unsuccessful due to invalid user credentials and the exhaustion of available authentication methods.
   - The system correctly identified and logged these failed attempts, indicating robust security measures in place.

In summary, this log chunk highlights a series of unauthorized and failed SSH login attempts from a single IP address, 103.99.0.122, targeting multiple user accounts.
