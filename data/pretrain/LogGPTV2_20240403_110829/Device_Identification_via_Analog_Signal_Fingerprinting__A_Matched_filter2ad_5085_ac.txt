the matched ﬁlter for the proﬁling of wireless signals. Ma-
jor challenges include adjusting the sensitivity of the ﬁlter
to handle ﬂuctuations of amplitude. Possible solutions to
this problem include signal normalization and equalization.
6. Conclusion
We have shown that the matched ﬁlter can be reliably
used to build signal proﬁles that can be used to discrimi-
nate between Ethernet cards of different models. By ap-
plying the matched ﬁlter in non-traditional ways, we have
also demonstrated that it is possible to discriminate between
seemingly identical cards, which appear to have originated
from the same manufacturing lot. Finally, we have demon-
strated that the analog signal characteristics of Ethernet de-
vices can be tracked, and are thus suitable for use in net-
work access control schemes. The techniques used in eval-
uating the effectiveness of the matched ﬁlter method have
also been given. Future work will focus on applying our
methods to the high-speed (100Mb and 1Gb Ethernet) and
wireless domains (802.11b, sensor networks, and RFID sys-
tems), as well as exploring how device behavior changes
due to environmental factors and aging.
