Repro:
  1. Start up a kube cluster.
  2. Make some API calls that result in 404 (e.g. http://apiserver/aaa or http://apiserver/api/v1/pods/aaa) or 503 (kill etcd and make some API calls).
  3. Visit http://apiserver/metrics.
Expected behavior: The metrics that have a "code" tag (e.g.
apiserver_request_count and rest_client_request_status_codes) should have
lines referring to code="404" or code="503".  
Actual behavior: No such lines exist. Only code="200" lines exist.
Happening at HEAD (`730a6a1`). This is currently blocking us from monitoring
and alerting on 5xx errors.
