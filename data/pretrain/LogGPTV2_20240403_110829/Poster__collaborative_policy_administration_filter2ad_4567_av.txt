### Actions and Their Implications

Actions, particularly in the context of their political implications, have the potential or ability to change the status quo and, as a result, influence human nature. From the perspective of the state of exception, contemporary society embodies the potential to transform current conditions and allow new norms to become mainstream. Interpreting Public Innovation Places (PIPs) in this light emphasizes how people-powered public services could evolve from niche practices to mainstream acceptance. Similarly, co-design and co-production of services could also transition from exceptions to the norm. The partner state, as an exceptional model, might eventually replace the welfare state as we know it today. PIPs, as a means to make the process of co-producing services tangible at every step, are powerful tools for creating and supporting people-powered public services. As such, they can be seen as potent instruments for the partner state to become the rule.

### Rousseau's Theory and Designers' Role

Referring back to Rousseau’s theory that changes in political paradigms affect human nature, designers and design schools play a crucial role in social innovation. They facilitate this paradigm shift by helping, supporting, and often initiating the process of co-designing services that involve both citizens and public authorities. Historically, this role was solely fulfilled by public authorities. Therefore, their work is essential in advancing this state of exception.

Design, in this context, becomes a form of political action. As design extends into the public realm, particularly in the domain of social innovation, this awareness should be further developed. The field of design, thus, takes on a political dimension.

### PIPs as Thresholds

The state of exception defines a threshold, a place on the borders of society. PIPs, as thresholds, operate within society but in a manner that differs from traditional methods. Similar to the Arcades in Walter Benjamin’s Parisian Passages—galleries of glass and steel that give the illusion of the outside world—PIPs are physical spaces of exception where the inside and outside of society and decision-making intersect.

As in-between spaces, PIPs also resemble the rhizomatic structures described by Deleuze and Guattari in "A Thousand Plateaus": a-hierarchical, a-centric, open, and capable of taking on multiple configurations. The metaphor of the "rhizome" points towards new forms of knowledge sharing and development, beyond the rigidities of former structures based on strict categories, dichotomies, and hierarchies. This metaphor can be extended to envision a society structured in an alternative, 'exceptional' way.

Characterized by their experimental and in-between nature, PIPs fit the mold of Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizomatic metaphor. However, new structures and frameworks require new evaluation methods. Do these initiatives represent genuine revolutionary power kickstarting systemic change? Could they continue to play this role, or would they be absorbed into the mainstream, reinforcing the current state of things? How can we compare and evaluate different PIP experiences globally? These questions, while not yet fully answerable, are worth asking and reflecting upon. They underscore the responsibility of designers and design schools to maintain their vocation of working towards positive societal change.

### Conclusion: A Participatory Way of Co-Designing a New Society

Previous sections have addressed how people-powered public services, embedded within local contexts, can provide added value to society. However, they also highlight risks, such as underestimating their political impact and the risk of losing their exceptional character. PIPs and similar initiatives should strive to grow and multiply, but they must remain critical in seeking new, exceptional ways to approach challenges continuously.

Time will tell whether such initiatives will bring about profound systemic change. Current global signals suggest the potential for such change, indicating a new paradigm where citizens, entrepreneurs, and the public sector join forces in a partner state model. Experimentation with people-powered public services is valuable, and PIPs offer a diverse typology for such experimentation. Learning from successes and failures, and evaluating them through a different mindset, is a challenge for the community of practice.

Co-design and co-production of people-powered public services benefit from dedicated physical spaces that support the gathering of inhabitants, civil servants, and policymakers. These spaces aid in the continuity of projects, facilitate exposure and adoption, and catalyze positive change. If PIPs support people-powered services, and the latter contribute to a paradigm shift, then PIPs can be seen as important levers in the transition towards a partner or relational state.

Further research is needed to understand PIPs and their role in societal transformation. Design schools have a key role to play in this. The DESIS Public and Collaborative cluster is already working in this direction, exploring the political value and philosophical implications of the change PIPs might bring about. This discussion will help better understand the roles and responsibilities of designers, design schools, and PIP stakeholders in today’s and tomorrow’s society.

### Implications for Design Practice, Education, and Policy

**Design Practice:**
Collaborations, such as the one with the Design Biennial of Liège (B) Reciprocity, have been valuable in showcasing the possibilities of design schools as laboratories of action-oriented social innovation. The project received international attention, contributing to a vibrant discussion on the value of such projects for society and the field of contemporary design.

**Design Education:**
In the Euregion, the project has established a local example of design for social innovation, raising awareness and providing a reference for didactical and research activities. It has also been showcased in the DESIS Showcase at the International Cumulus Conference in Santiago, Chile, in November 2012.

**Design for Policy:**
By involving policymakers and engaging the public, the project has helped sensitize the public to the use of design for social innovation. It has made abstract concepts concrete, increasing understanding and awareness of the possibilities of the approach and the roles design schools can play as agents of social change.
