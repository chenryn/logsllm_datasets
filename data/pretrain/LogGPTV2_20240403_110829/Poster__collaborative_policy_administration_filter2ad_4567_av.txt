actions: i.e. their political implications, their potential 
or ability to change the state of things and, as such, to 
affect human nature.
From the point of view of the state of exception 
contemporary society embodies the potentiality 
to change the state of things and allow them to 
become mainstream. Reading PIPs as such, would 
emphasize the way people-powered public services 
could grow from a niche - a state of exception - to 
become mainstream, as could the way of co-design 
and co-producing services. Along the same line of 
reasoning, the partner state, as a state of exception, 
could eventually ‘replace’ the welfare state as we know 
it today. The PIP, as a means to open up the possibility 
of gathering and making the process of co-producing 
services tangible in all of its steps, is a powerful 
medium to create and support people-powered 
public services, as such, could be regarded a powerful 
instrument for the partner state as the exception to 
become the rule. 
Referring back to Rousseau’s theory mentioned 
earlier63, namely that the changing of political 
paradigm affects human nature, we can see how 
designers and design schools as key actors in the 
process of social innovation have a responsibility 
here. As a matter of fact, they are facilitators of this 
paradigm shift, as they are the ones that help, support, 
and often initiate the process of co-design of services 
which involve both citizens and public authorities, 
a role that in the past used to be fulfilled solely by 
public authorities. As such, their work can help to 
propel this state of exception forward. 
Design as such becomes political 
action. As design extends 
into the public realm 
in general and soci(et)
al innovation in 
particular, this 
awareness 
could and 
should be 
developed 
further. 
The field, 
97
The state of exception defines a threshold, a place on 
the borders of society.64 PIPs as thresholds act within 
society but also in a way which differs from traditional 
modus operandi. Much like the Arcades in Walter 
Benjamin’s Parisian Passages65 - i.e. the Galleries of 
glass and steel which give the illusion of the outside 
world - PIPs are physical spaces of exception, of the 
threshold, where inside and outside of society and 
decision-making meet. 
As in-between spaces PIPs also resemble in a way 
the rhizomatic66 structures described by Deleuze and 
Guattari in their “A Thousand Plateaus”67: a-hierarchical, 
a-centric, open, able to take on a thousand different 
configurations. The metaphor of the “rhizome” also 
points towards new forms of knowledge sharing and 
development, beyond the rigidities of former structures 
based on strict categories, dichotomies and hierarchies. 
One could extend it as such to an image of society 
being structured in an alternative, ‘exceptional’ way.
Characterized by their in-between and experimental 
nature, their operating in an open, a-hierarchical, 
a-centric way, PIPs indeed seem to fit the mould of 
Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizomatic metaphor. Yet, new 
structures, new frameworks also require new ways to 
evaluate them. 
Do these initiatives represent a genuine revolutionary 
power kickstarting systemic change? Could they 
continue to play that role? Or would they instead 
soon become just another instrument to reinforce 
the current state of things, being absorbed into the 
mainstream? How can we compare and evaluating 
the different experiences of PIPs we encounter on a 
global scale? Most of  these questions can probably 
not be answered yet now, but are very much worth 
asking and reflecting upon. They further emphasize 
also the responsibility of designers and design 
schools to maintain their genuine vocation of 
representing and working towards valuable, positive 
societal change.
4 CONCLUSION
4.1 A participatory way of co-designing a new society
The previous sections have addressed many of 
the ways in which people-powered public services 
and their embedding within local contexts both 
physically and in terms of social fabric, could provide 
added value to society in view of positive change. 
Yet they also feature some risks ranging from the 
underestimation of their political impact and value 
to the risk of losing their exceptional character and 
becoming absorbed into the mainstream. The latter 
does not imply PIPs and the likes should not strive 
to grow or multiply, yet should be critical in seeking 
new alternatives, exceptional ways of approaching 
challenges continuously.
Time will tell whether initiatives such as these will 
grow powerful enough to bring about profound 
systemic change in society or not. Current signals 
which can be picked up globally however, do seem to 
signal such change or at least its potential and can 
be considered seeds of a new emerging paradigm of 
citizens, entrepreneurs and the public sector joining 
forces in a partner state kind of model. 
Most valuable in this respect today is probably 
to experiment as much as possible with what 
people-powered public services can mean to our 
contemporary society, how such experimentation can 
be supported and kept going, e.g. through the setup of 
a diverse typology of PIPs. The latter appear to contain 
valuable ingredients. Experimentation with different 
recipes will allow us to learn from successes and 
failures. If it is true what we previously stated, i.e. that 
all these phenomena belong to a rhizomatic paradigm 
of knowledge sharing and creation, we need also to 
evaluate such successes and failures, such approaches, 
through the lens of a different mindset. This is a 
challenge for the community of practice to take up.
The co-design and co-production of people-powered 
public services can benefit greatly from the presence 
of a dedicated physical space, equipped to support the 
physical gathering of inhabitants, civil servants and 
eventually policy makers to co-create new solutions. 
Moreover, they provide added value to the solutions 
developed as such by supporting continuity, facilitating 
exposure and adoption by third parties. They can aid 
in the continuity of projects started by design schools/
designers, their aftercare, but also in initiating new 
initiatives and bringing the right people and resources 
together, thereby further catalyzing positive change. 
If PIPs support people-powered services, and the 
latter contribute to a paradigm shift, as mentioned by 
Bauwens and Cottam, then we can also say that PIPs 
- as physical laboratories for social experimentation 
and innovation - can imply an important lever in the 
transition towards a partner or relational state. 
Further understanding of PIPs and how they can be a 
valuable resource towards an actual societal paradigm 
shift requires further research. Design schools as such 
definitely have a key role to play in this. Essentially this 
is the direction in which several educational partners 
within the DESIS Public and Collaborative cluster68 are 
working. Besides the ways in which they can be tools 
or platforms for change, also their political value and 
the more philosophical implications of the change 
they might bring about need to be investigated further. 
That discussion will also fuel the debate and help 
to better understand the role and responsibility of 
designers, design schools, PIP stakeholders etc. within 
today’s and tomorrow’s society.

IMPLICATIONS FOR: 
DESIGN PRACTICE
The collaboration with the Design Biennial of Liège (B) Reciprocity has been 
helpful and valuable in showcasing the possibilities provided by design schools 
as laboratories of action-oriented social innovation and the added value of such 
approaches/initiatives and collaborative settings of design for social innovation in 
the region. Although small in scale, the project received a lot of attention from the 
international press, thereby further contributing to a vivid discussion on the value of 
this kind of projects for society as well as the (sub)field(s) of contemporary design.
The collaboration with colleagues and projects within the P&C cluster through 
online meetings, conferences, papers and so on, has been stimulating, inspiring and 
informative in many ways. Especially also a more general reflection on the value of 
people-powered public services in society and the role of design schools as actors or 
catalysts in the field of social innovation has contributed significantly to a broader 
set of arguments pro and contra the adoption of certain roles by designers/design 
schools or other stakeholders within a project or specific phases.
DESIGN EDUCATION
In the Euregion the project has managed to establish a local example of design for 
social innovation, raising awareness for the field and its societal contribution. Also 
within the design schools, e.g. the Department of Product Design of MAD Faculty 
the project has been referenced as an important example of the direction in which 
didactical and research activities can be combined and reinforce one another, while 
also delivering value to the societal context of the school in the region. Furthermore, 
the project has been showcased in the DESIS Showcase at the International Cumulus 
Conference in Santiago, Chile, November 2012
DESIGN FOR POLICY
The project, by involving policy makers as stakeholders and promoters, and the 
exhibition, as a moment of public confrontation with the inhabitants of Saint-Gilles, 
have helped to inform and sensibilize the public opinion regarding the use of design 
for social innovation. It has rendered the abstract concrete for them. Increasing 
their understanding in a learning-by-doing kind of way, has made public authorities 
more aware of the possibilities of the approach as well as the various stakeholders 
involved, not in the least of the roles design schools can play as agents of social 
change and the value of local inhabitants as an asset in the co-design, co-production 
and continuation of initiatives developed.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
Virginia Tassinari, has a background in philosophy. Schooled in the critical theory tradition of the Frankfurt 
Schule, she now applies the study of criticism of society to the contemporary context, and translates its categories 
to the world of design. Actively engaged in both teaching and research activities at the MAD Faculty (Belgium) 
she develops socially relevant projects within her classes and contributes to various initiatives aimed at social 
innovation. She founded a DESIS Lab within her research group Social Spaces CUO. In her academic activities, 
through publications and lectures she mainly focusses on the relationship between social innovation and 
philosophy, practice and theory. She is actively involved in the collection and dissemination of international cases 
of social innovation through the DESIS Showcase initiative and feeds the discourse on the relationship between 
theory and practice of social innovation through the initiative of the DESIS Philosophy Talks. Besides her activities 
within DESIS, Virginia is also a member of the Executive Board of Cumulus, the international Association of 
Universities of Art, Media and Design.

 Design schools are complementary partners here and do not necessarily represent competition. They can enrich 
the work of Ngo’s and design studios. Not being “in a market situation”, gives them the freedom to experiment 
and fail. On the other side, Ngo’s and design studios can be complementary to and/or provide follow-up services 
to the work of design schools because of expertise, professional know-how, quality assurance etc.

 The initiative came from a local design event - the Design Biennial of of the city of Liège (B), called 
Reciprocity- with the support of the regional public institution for Design, Wallonie Design, and of Recentre, a 
Euregional Project for Sustainable Design.
 What we counted for instance amongst those was the scarcity of social cohesion and social control, the 
perception of danger in the neighbourhood around the local park, the lack of sense of safety, a big amount of 
squatted houses and empty buildings and shops, the problem of seasonality, and the lack of variety of shops 
and services. Many of these issues had to do with the fact that one third of the people living in Saint-Gilles 
are basically students. This disproportion can probably be considered the neighbourhood’s wicked problem.
 The students have been working with cultural and urban probes, making street performances in order to 
engage participation and collect useful information.
 For instance the creation of house restaurants, of new rituals of brushing together each evening the public 
spaces, of a collective artwork for connecting the side streets with the park and so on. For a full list of the 
projects’ description please visit the online exhibition Welcome to Saint-Gilles: http://www.designliege.be/

 The designer of the exhibition Welcome to Saint-Gilles is Thomas Lommee, that was also involved in the 
project as teacher and expert of one of the eight schools (Design Academy Eindhoven in this case). For more 
info please see: http://www.intrastructures.net
 The way in which the exhibition was designed intended to facilitate the communication of the projects and 
the possibility to empower people. A postcard format was used for the different projects so that the visitors 
could take home the ideas they intended to develop. On the cards one could find the contact of the key 
stakeholders and of the students. This encouraged the private initiative and the rise of spontaneous initiatives 
initially powered by the students.
