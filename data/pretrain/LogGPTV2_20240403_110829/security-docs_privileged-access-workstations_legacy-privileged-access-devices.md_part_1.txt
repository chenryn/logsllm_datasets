# Legacy privileged access guidance
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guidance has been replaced with updated [secure workstation](https://aka.ms/PAW) guidance that is part of a complete solution for [securing privileged access](https://aka.ms/SPA).

## Legacy guidance
Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) provide a dedicated operating system for sensitive tasks that is protected from Internet attacks and threat vectors. Separating these sensitive tasks and accounts from the daily use workstations and devices provides strong protection from phishing attacks, application and OS vulnerabilities, various impersonation attacks, and credential theft attacks such as keystroke logging, [Pass-the-Hash](https://aka.ms/pth), and Pass-The-Ticket.
## What is a Privileged Access Workstation?
In simplest terms, a PAW is a hardened and locked down workstation designed to provide high security assurances for sensitive accounts and tasks. PAWs are recommended for administration of identity systems, cloud services, private cloud fabric, and sensitive business functions.
> [!NOTE]
> The PAW architecture doesn't require a 1:1 mapping of accounts to workstations, though this is a common configuration. PAW creates a trusted workstation environment that can be used by one or more accounts.
In order to provide the greatest security, PAWs should always run the most up-to-date and secure operating system available: Microsoft strongly recommends Windows 11 Enterprise, which includes several other security features not available in other editions (in particular, [Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard) and [Device Guard](/windows/security/threat-protection/device-guard/introduction-to-device-guard-virtualization-based-security-and-windows-defender-application-control)).
> [!NOTE]
> Organizations without access to Windows 11 Enterprise can use Windows 11 Pro, which includes many of the critical foundational technologies for PAWs, including Trusted Boot, BitLocker, and Remote Desktop. Education customers can use Windows 11 Education.
>
> Windows 11 Home should not be used for a PAW.
The PAW security controls are focused on mitigating high impact and high probability risks of compromise. These include mitigating attacks on the environment and risks that can decrease the effectiveness of PAW controls over time:
* **Internet attacks** - Most attacks originate directly or indirectly from internet sources and use the internet for exfiltration and command and control (C2). Isolating the PAW from the open internet is a key element to ensuring the PAW isn't compromised.
* **Usability risk** - If a PAW is too difficult to use for daily tasks, administrators are motivated to create workarounds to make their jobs easier. Frequently, these workarounds open the administrative workstation and accounts to significant security risks, so it's critical to involve and empower the PAW users to mitigate these usability issues securely. This can be accomplished by listening to their feedback, installing tools and scripts required to perform their jobs, and ensuring all administrative personnel are aware of why they need to use a PAW, what a PAW is, and how to use it correctly and successfully.
* **Environment risks** - Because many other computers and accounts in the environment are exposed to internet risk directly or indirectly, a PAW must be protected against attacks from compromised assets in the production environment. This requires minimizing the use of management tools and accounts that have access to the PAWs to secure and monitor these specialized workstations.
* **Supply chain tampering** - While it's impossible to remove all possible risks of tampering in the supply chain for hardware and software, taking a few key actions can mitigate critical attack vectors that are readily available to attackers. This includes validating the integrity of all installation media and using a trusted and reputable supplier for hardware and software.
* **Physical attacks** - Because PAWs can be physically mobile and used outside of physically secure facilities, they must be protected against attacks that apply unauthorized physical access to the computer.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A PAW will not protect an environment from an adversary that has already gained administrative access over an Active Directory Forest.
> Because many existing implementations of Active Directory Domain Services have been operating for years at risk of credential theft, organizations should assume breach and consider the possibility that they might have an undetected compromise of domain or enterprise administrator credentials. An organization that suspects domain compromise should consider the use of professional incident response services.

### Legacy PAW hardware profiles
Administrative personnel are standard users too - they need a PAW and a standard user workstation to check email, browse the web, and access corporate line-of-business applications. Ensuring that administrators can remain both productive and secure is essential to the success of any PAW deployment. A secure solution that dramatically limits productivity will be abandoned by the users in favor of one that enhances productivity (even if it's done in an insecure manner).
In order to balance the need for security with the need for productivity, Microsoft recommends using one of these PAW hardware profiles:
* **Dedicated hardware** - Separate dedicated devices for user tasks vs. administrative tasks.
* **Simultaneous Use** - Single device that can run user tasks and administrative tasks concurrently by taking advantage of OS or presentation virtualization.
Organizations might use only one profile or both. There are no interoperability concerns between the hardware profiles, and organizations have the flexibility to match the hardware profile to the specific need and situation of a given administrator.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is critical that, in all these scenarios, administrative personnel are issued a standard user account that is separate from designated administrative account(s). The administrative account(s) should only be used on the PAW administrative operating system.
This table summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each hardware profile from the perspective of operational ease-of-use and productivity and security. Both hardware approaches provide strong security for administrative accounts against credential theft and reuse.
|**Scenario**|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|--------|---------|-----------|
|Dedicated hardware|-   Strong signal for sensitivity of tasks-   Strongest security separation|-   Extra desk space -   Extra weight (for remote work)-   Hardware Cost|
|Simultaneous use|-   Lower hardware cost-   Single device experience|-   Sharing single keyboard/mouse creates risk of inadvertent errors/risks|
This guidance contains the detailed instructions for the PAW configuration for the dedicated hardware approach. If you have requirements for the simultaneous use hardware profiles, you can adapt the instructions based on this guidance yourself or hire a professional services organization like Microsoft to assist with it.
#### Dedicated hardware
In this scenario, a PAW is used for administration that is separate from the PC that is used for daily activities like email, document editing, and development work. All administrative tools and applications are installed on the PAW and all productivity applications are installed on the standard user workstation. The step-by-step instructions in this guidance are based on this hardware profile.
#### Simultaneous use - Adding RemoteApp, RDP, or a VDI
In this simultaneous use scenario, a single PC is used for both administration tasks and daily activities like email, document editing and development work. In this configuration, the user operating systems are deployed and managed centrally (on the cloud or in your datacenter), but aren't available while disconnected.
![A diagram showing a single PC in a simultaneous use scenario used for both administration tasks and daily activities with an intermediary like VDI.](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/paw-intermediary-simultanious-use.png)
The physical hardware runs a single PAW operating system locally for administrative tasks and contacts a Microsoft or third party remote desktop service for user applications such as email, document editing, and line-of-business applications.
In this configuration, daily work that doesn't require administrative privileges is done in the Remote OS(es) and applications, which aren't subject to restrictions applied to the PAW host. All administrative work is done on the Admin OS.
To configure this, follow the instructions in this guidance for the PAW host, allow network connectivity to the Remote Desktop services, and then add shortcuts to the PAW user's desktop to access the applications. The remote desktop services could be hosted in many ways including:
* An existing Remote Desktop or VDI service like [Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop/overview), [Microsoft Dev Box](/azure/dev-box/), or [Windows 365](/windows-365/overview).
* A new service you install on-premises or in the cloud
* Azure RemoteApp using preconfigured templates or your own installation images
## Architecture overview
The following diagram depicts a separate "channel" for administration (a highly sensitive task) that is created by maintaining separate dedicated administrative accounts and workstations.
![A diagram showing a separate "channel" for administration by maintaining separate dedicated administrative accounts and workstations](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/separate-channel-administration.png)
This architectural approach builds on the protections found in the Windows 11 [Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard) and [Device Guard](/windows/security/threat-protection/device-guard/introduction-to-device-guard-virtualization-based-security-and-windows-defender-application-control) features and goes beyond those protections for sensitive accounts and tasks.
This methodology is appropriate for accounts with access to high value assets:
* **Administrative Privileges** - PAWs provide increased security for high impact IT administrative roles and tasks. This architecture can be applied to administration of many types of systems including Active Directory Domains and Forests, Microsoft Entra ID tenants, Microsoft 365 tenants, Process Control Networks (PCN), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), and Point of Sale (PoS) devices.
* **High Sensitivity Information workers** - The approach used in a PAW can also provide protection for highly sensitive information worker tasks and personnel such as those involving preannouncement merger and acquisition activity, prerelease financial reports, organizational social media presence, executive communications, unpatented trade secrets, sensitive research, or other proprietary or sensitive data. This guidance doesn't discuss the configuration of these information worker scenarios in depth or include this scenario in the technical instructions.
This document describes why this practice is recommended for protecting high impact privileged accounts, what these PAW solutions look like for protecting administrative privileges, and how to quickly deploy a PAW solution for domain and cloud services administration.
This document provides detailed guidance for implementing several PAW configurations and includes detailed implementation instructions to get you started on protecting common high impact accounts:
* [**Phase 1 - Immediate Deployment for Active Directory Administrators**](#phase-1-immediate-deployment-for-active-directory-administrators) this provides a PAW quickly that can protect on premises domain and forest administration roles
* [**Phase 2 - Extend PAW to all administrators**](#phase-2-extend-paw-to-all-administrators) this enables protection for administrators of cloud services like Microsoft 365 and Azure, enterprise servers, enterprise applications, and workstations
* [**Phase 3 - Advanced PAW security**](#phase-3-extend-and-enhance-protection) this discusses more protections and considerations for PAW security
### Why dedicated workstations?
The current threat environment for organizations is rife with sophisticated phishing and other internet attacks that create continuous risk of security compromise for internet exposed accounts and workstations.
This threat environment requires organizations to adopt an "assume breach" security posture when designing protections for high value assets like administrative accounts and sensitive business assets. These high value assets need to be protected against both direct internet threats and attacks mounted from other workstations, servers, and devices in the environment.
![Figure showing the risk to managed assets if an attacker gains control of a user workstation where sensitive credentials are used](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/attack-risk-of-compromised-asset.png)
This figure depicts risk to managed assets if an attacker gains control of a user workstation where sensitive credentials are used.
An attacker in control of an operating system has numerous ways in which to illicitly gain access to all activity on the workstation and impersonate the legitimate account. Various known and unknown attack techniques can be used to gain this level of access. The increasing volume and sophistication of cyberattacks have made it necessary to extend that separation concept to separate client operating systems for sensitive accounts. For more information on these types of attacks, visit the [Pass The Hash web site](https://www.microsoft.com/pth) for informative white papers, videos and more.
The PAW approach is an extension of the well-established recommended practice to use separate admin and user accounts for administrative personnel. This practice uses an individually assigned administrative account that is separate from the user's standard user account. PAW builds on that account separation practice by providing a trustworthy workstation for those sensitive accounts.
This PAW guidance is intended to help you implement this capability for protecting high value accounts such as high-privileged IT administrators and high sensitivity business accounts. The guidance helps you:
* Restrict exposure of credentials to only trusted hosts
* Provide a high-security workstation to administrators so they can easily perform administrative tasks.
Restricting the sensitive accounts to using only hardened PAWs is a straightforward protection for these accounts that is both highly usable for administrators and difficult for an adversary to defeat.
### Alternate approaches
This section contains information on how the security of alternate approaches compares to PAW and how to correctly integrate these approaches within a PAW architecture. all these approaches carry significant risks when implemented in isolation, but can add value to a PAW implementation in some scenarios.
#### Credential Guard and Windows Hello for Business
Part of Windows 11, [Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard) uses hardware and virtualization-based security to mitigate common credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash, by protecting the derived credentials. The private key for credentials used by [Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-identity-verification) can be protected by Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware.
These are powerful mitigations, but workstations can still be vulnerable to certain attacks even if the credentials are protected by Credential Guard or Windows Hello for Business. Attacks can include abusing privileges and use of credentials directly from a compromised device, reusing previously stolen credentials prior to enabling Credential Guard and abuse of management tools and weak application configurations on the workstation.
The PAW guidance in this section includes the use of many of these technologies for high sensitivity accounts and tasks.
#### Administrative VM
An administrative virtual machine (Admin VM) is a dedicated operating system for administrative tasks hosted on a standard user desktop. While this approach is similar to PAW in providing a dedicated OS for administrative tasks, it has a fatal flaw in that the administrative VM is dependent on the standard user desktop for its security.
The following diagram depicts the ability of attackers to follow the control chain to the target object of interest with an Admin VM on a User Workstation and that it's difficult to create a path on the reverse configuration.
The PAW architecture doesn't allow for hosting an Admin VM on a User Workstation, but a User VM with a standard corporate image can be hosted on an Admin PAW to provide personnel with a single PC for all responsibilities.
![A diagram of the PAW architecture.](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/paw-architecture.png)
#### Jump server
Administrative "Jump Server" architectures set up a small number administrative console servers and restrict personnel to using them for administrative tasks. This is typically based on remote desktop services, a 3rd-party presentation virtualization solution, or a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) technology.
This approach is frequently proposed to mitigate risk to administration and does provide some security assurances, but the jump server approach by itself is vulnerable to certain attacks because it violates the clean source principle. The clean source principle requires all security dependencies to be as trustworthy as the object being secured.
![A diagram showing a simple control relationship.](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/simple-control-relationship.png)
This figure depicts a simple control relationship. Any subject in control of an object is a security dependency of that object. If an adversary can control a security dependency of a target object (subject), they can control that object.
The administrative session on the jump server relies on the integrity of the local computer accessing it. If this computer is a user workstation subject to phishing attacks and other internet-based attack vectors, then the administrative session is also subject to those risks.
![A diagram showing how attackers can follow an established control chain to the target object of interest.](./media/legacy-privileged-access-devices/establish-attack-chain.png)
The previous figure depicts how attackers can follow an established control chain to the target object of interest.
While some advanced security controls like Multifactor authentication can increase the difficulty of an attacker taking over this administrative session from the user workstation, no security feature can fully protect against technical attacks when an attacker has administrative access of the source computer (for example, injecting illicit commands into a legitimate session, hijacking legitimate processes, and so on.)
