The `with-external-scoped-css` approach is not ideal, especially in larger systems where it can significantly increase the workload. Additionally, I believe that using `styled-jsx` is not a good solution, as it does not integrate well with other open-source UI frameworks.

Have you considered adopting `Sass` in combination with `CSS Modules` as the primary styling solution? This approach offers better integration and maintainability.
