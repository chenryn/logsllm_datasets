Assistant: This log chunk is related to the PhoneStatusBar, NotificationManager, StackScrollAlgorithm, ActivityManager, DisplayPowerController, and AudioManager software components. It appears to be related to the removal of a notification, as the PhoneStatusBar is removingNotificationChildren and the NotificationManager is marking a notification as seen. The StackScrollAlgorithm is then updating clipping and dimmed activated hide sensitive settings. The ActivityManager is getting running app processes, and the DisplayPowerController is animating brightness. Finally, the AudioManager is playing a sound effect.
