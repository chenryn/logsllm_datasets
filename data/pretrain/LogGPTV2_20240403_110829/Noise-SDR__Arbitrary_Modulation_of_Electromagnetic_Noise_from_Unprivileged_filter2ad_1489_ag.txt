APPENDIX A
BASICS OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS
Complex notation: A generic signal x(t) can be conveniently
represented as the projection on the real axis of a complex vector
with amplitude a(t) and angle θ(t) (the angle can be expressed in
terms of frequency f and phase φ(t)):
x(t)=Re{a(t)ei(2πft+φ(t))}=a(t)cos(2πft+φ(t))
θ(t)=2πft+φ(t)
(3)
Frequency domain and radio signals: A baseband signal
xbb(t) with amplitude abb(t) and angle θbb(t) carries the information
that has to be transmitted. In the frequency domain it occupies the
range −B to B, where the bandwidth B is its maximum frequency
component. This signal is shifted (up-converted) to a carrier
frequency fc, resulting into a modulated carrier:
xrf (t)=abb(t)cos(2πfct+θbb(t))
(4)
In the frequency domain, this signal occupies the range fc−B to
fc +B. In this case, the term bandwidth is often used to indicate
the occupied spectrum 2B.
Modulation: Any type of analog or digital amplitude and/or
angle (frequency or phase) modulation can be implemented with
a proper choice of the baseband signal. See Table V for a brief
list. The modulated carrier xrf(t) can be rewritten as the sum of
its in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components:
xrf (t)=I(t)cos(2πfct)+Q(t)cos(2πfct+
π
2
I(t)=abb(t)cos(θbb(t)), Q(t)=abb(t)sin(θbb(t))
)
(5)
Implementing a quadrature modulator (Equation 5) is often more
convenient than implementing a polar modulator (Equation 4).
Superheterodyne: In this two-stage architecture, the baseband
signal is first modulated on an intermediate frequency fIF , and
then further up-converted to the radio-frequency carrier fc.
Discrete time and quantization: Digital software and hardware
work with a discrete-time digital representation of signals, that is, a
sequence of samples xs[i]=x(t=i/Fs), where Fs is the sampling
rate. Each sample xs[i] is represented with a digital number that
can only take a finite number of values (quantization levels).
Modems: In short, a modem takes the input bits to transmit,
and generates the samples xs[i] = abb[i/Fs] ∗ cos(2πfIF i/Fs +
communication devices,” 2012.
