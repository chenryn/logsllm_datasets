Figure 6: Log-log plot of the outdegree versus the average indegree of friends. The scale-free metrics, included
in the legend, suggest the presence of a well-connected core.
To quantitatively explore this phenomenon, we next ex-
amine two metrics based on the joint degree distribution:
the scale-free metric s and the assortativity r.
5.5.2 Scale-free behavior
The scale-free metric s [31] is a value calculated directly
from the joint degree distribution of a graph. The scale-free
metric ranges between 0 and 1, and measures the extent to
which the graph has a hub-like core. A high scale-free metric
means that high-degree nodes tend to connect to other high-
degree nodes, while a low scale-free metric means that high-
degree nodes tend to connect to low-degree nodes.
The scale-free metric of the networks are shown in the
legend of Figure 6. All of the networks with the exception
of YouTube show a signiﬁcant s, indicating that high-degree
nodes tend to connect to other high-degree nodes, and low-
degree nodes tend to connect to low-degree nodes.
5.5.3 Assortativity
The scale-free metric is related to the assortativity coeﬃ-
cient r, which is a measure of the likelihood for nodes to con-
nect to other nodes with similar degrees. The assortativity
coeﬃcient ranges between -1 and 1; a high assortativity coef-
ﬁcient means that nodes tend to connect to nodes of similar
degree, while a negative coeﬃcient means that nodes likely
connect to nodes with very diﬀerent degree from their own
Recent work has suggested that the scale-free metric is more
suitable for comparing the structure of diﬀerent graphs [30],
as it takes into account the possible conﬁgurations of net-
works with properties including connectedness and no self-
loops. However, for completeness, we calculated the assorta-
tivity coeﬃcients for each of the networks, and found 0.202
for Flickr, 0.179 for LiveJournal, 0.072 for Orkut, and -0.033
for YouTube.
The assortativity shows yet another diﬀerence between
the social networks and other previously observed power-
law networks. For example, the Web and the Internet have
both been shown to have negative assortativity coeﬃcients
of -0.067 and -0.189, respectively [42]. On the other hand,
many scientiﬁc coauthorship networks, a diﬀerent type of
social network, have been shown to have positive r [42].
Taken together, the signiﬁcant scale-free metric and the
positive assortativity coeﬃcient suggests that there exists
a tightly-connected “core” of the high-degree nodes which
connect to each other, with the lower-degree nodes on the
fringes of the network. In the next few sections, we explore
the properties of these two components of the graph in de-
tail.
5.6 Densely connected core
We loosely deﬁne a core of a network as any (minimal) set of
nodes that satisﬁes two properties: First, the core must be
necessary for the connectivity of the network (i.e., removing
the core breaks the remainder of the nodes into many small,
disconnected clusters). Second, the core must be strongly
connected with a relatively small diameter. Thus, a “core”
is a small group of well-connected group of nodes that is
necessary to keep the remainder of the network connected.
To more closely explore the core of the network, we use an
approximation previously used in Web graph analysis [12].
Speciﬁcally, we remove increasing numbers of the highest
degree nodes and analyze the connectivity of the remaining
graph.12 We calculate the size of the largest remaining SCC,
which is the largest set of users who can mutually reach each
other.
As we remove the highest degree nodes, the largest SCC
begins to split into smaller-sized SCCs. Figure 7 shows the
composition of the splits as we remove between 0.01% and
10% of the highest-degree nodes in Flickr. The correspond-
ing graphs for the other social networks look similar, and
we omit them for lack of space. Once we remove 10% of the
highest indegree nodes,13 the largest SCC partitions into
millions of very small SCCs consisting of only a handful of
nodes.

To understand how much the network core contributes to-
wards the small path lengths, we analyzed the path lengths

degree.
of subgraphs containing only the highest-degree nodes. Fig-
ure 8 shows how path lengths increase as we generate larger
subgraphs of the core by progressively including nodes or-
dered inversely by their degree. The average path length
increases sub-logarithmically with the size of the core.
In
Flickr, for example, the overall average path length is 5.67,
of which 3.5 hops involve the 10% of nodes in the core with
the highest degrees. This suggests that the high-degree core
nodes in these networks are all within roughly four hops of
each other, while the rest of the nodes, which constitute the
majority of the network, are at most a few hops away from
the core nodes.

Figure 8: Average path length among the most well-
connected nodes. The path length increases sub-
logarithmically.
Thus, the graphs we study have a densely connected core
comprising of between 1% and 10% of the highest degree
nodes, such that removing this core completely disconnects
the graph.
The structure of social networks, with its high dependence
on few highly connected nodes, may have implications for
information ﬂow, for trust relationships, and for the vulner-
ability of these networks to deliberate manipulation. The
small diameter and path lengths of social networks are likely
to impact the design of techniques for ﬁnding paths in such
networks, for instance, to check how closely related a given
pair of nodes is in the network. Such techniques have ap-
plications, for instance, in social networks used to verify the
trustworthiness or relevance of received information [17].
5.7 Tightly clustered fringe
Next, we consider the graph properties at the scale of local
neighborhoods outside of the core. We ﬁrst examine clus-
tering, which quantiﬁes how densely the neighborhood of a
node is connected.
The clustering coeﬃcient of a node with N neighbors is
deﬁned as the number of directed links that exist between
the node’s N neighbors, divided by the number of possible
directed links that could exist between the node’s neighbors
(N (N − 1)). The clustering coeﬃcient of a graph is the
average clustering coeﬃcient of all its nodes, and we denote
it as C.
Table 4 shows the clustering coeﬃcients for all four social
networks. For comparison, we show the ratio of the observed
clustering coeﬃcient to that of Erd¨os-R´eyni (ER) random
graphs [15] and random power-law graphs constructed with
preferential attachment [9], with the same number of nodes
and links. ER graphs have no link bias towards local nodes.
Hence, they provide a point of reference for the degree of
local clustering in the social networks. Graphs constructed

using preferential attachment also have no locality bias, as
preferential attachment is a global process, and they provide
a point of reference to the clustering in a graph with a similar
degree distribution.
The clustering coeﬃcients of social networks are between
three and ﬁve orders of magnitude larger than their corre-
sponding random graphs, and about one order of magnitude
larger than random power-law graphs. This unusually high
clustering coeﬃcient suggests the presence of strong local
clustering, and has a natural explanation in social networks:
people tend to be introduced to other people via mutual
friends, increasing the probability that two friends of a sin-
gle user are also friends.

Figure 9: Clustering coeﬃcient of users with diﬀer-
ent outdegrees. The users with few “friends” are
tightly clustered.
Figure 9 shows how the clustering coeﬃcients of nodes
vary with node outdegree. The clustering coeﬃcient is higher
for nodes of low degree, suggesting that there is signiﬁcant
clustering among low-degree nodes. This clustering and the
small diameter of these networks qualiﬁes these graphs as
small-world networks [52], and further indicates that the
graph has scale-free properties.
5.8 Groups
In many online social networks, users with shared interests
may create and join groups. Table 5 shows the high-level
statistics of user groups in the four networks we study. Par-
ticipation in user groups varies signiﬁcantly across the diﬀer-
ent networks: only 8% of YouTube users but 61% of Live-
Journal users declare group aﬃliations. Once again, the
group sizes follow a power-law distribution, in which the
vast majority have only a few users each.
Note that users in a group need not necessarily link to
each other in the social network graph. As it turns out,
however, user groups represent tightly clustered communi-
ties of users in the social network. This can be seen from
the average group clustering coeﬃcients of group members,

shown in Table 5.14 These coeﬃcients are higher than those
of the corresponding network graph as a whole (shown in
Table 4). Further, the members of smaller user groups tend
to be more clustered than those of larger groups. Figure 10
shows this by plotting the average group clustering coeﬃ-
cient for groups of diﬀerent sizes in the four observed net-
works. In fact, many of the small groups in these networks
are cliques.
