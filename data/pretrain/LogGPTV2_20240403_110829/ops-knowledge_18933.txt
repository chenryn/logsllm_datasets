User:  How to install and configure Elasticsearch on Linux system to realize full-text search and distributed storage?
Assistant: Install Elasticsearch 1. Install Java Elasticsearch depends on the Java environment, so Java needs to be installed in advance. You can install Java with the following command: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre Check whether Java is installed correctly: java -version 2. Download Elasticsearch and enter Elasticsearch official website (https://www.elastic.co/cn /downloads/elasticsearch) to download the latest version of Elasticsearch: wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.14.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz 3. Unzip Elasticsearch tar -zxvf elasticsearch-7.14 .0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz Configure Elasticsearch 1. Modify the configuration file and enter the decompressed elasticsearch directory, find the elasticsearch.yml file in the config directory, and open the file with a text editor: vi config/elasticsearch.yml Modify The following parameters: cluster.name: my-cluster node.name: node-1 network.host: 127.0.0.1 http.port: 9200 Among them, cluster.name is the name of the cluster, you can specify it arbitrarily; node.name is the node The name can be specified arbitrarily; network.host is the bound host address, which is specified as the local machine here; http.port is the HTTP service port of Elasticsearch, usually using port 9200. 2. Start Elasticsearch Start Elasticsearch by executing the following command: bin/elasticsearch You can see the startup process of Elasticsearch on the console, just wait for the startup to complete. 3. Verify the installation and run the following command. If the Elasticsearch information is returned, it means that Elasticsearch is installed and started successfully: curl http://localhost:9200/ Realize full-text search and distributed storage Elasticsearch's full-text search and distributed storage are its biggest features one. It can be achieved by the following methods: 1. Create a new index After starting Elasticsearch, you can use the curl command to create a new index: curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/my_index?pretty" Among them, my_index is the name of the index, which can be specified arbitrarily. 2. Add documents To add documents to the newly created index, you can use the following command: curl -X POST "localhost:9200/my_index/_doc/1?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' {" title": "Elasticsearch Tutorial", "author": "John Doe", "content": "This tutorial will teach you how to use Elasticsearch", "price": 99.99}' Among them, my_index is the name of the index, and _doc means Type (can be customized), 1 is the ID of the document (can be customized), and other parameters indicate the content of the document. 3. Search documents Use the following command for full-text search: curl -X GET "localhost:9200/my_index/_search?q=tutorial&pretty" Among them, my_index is the name of the index, _search means to search, q=tutorial means the search keyword, you can Use other parameters for a more detailed search. 4. Distributed storage The data storage of Elasticsearch is distributed by default, and multiple nodes can be used to store data. The above steps need to be performed on each node, creating an index with the same name and adding documents. Elasticsearch will automatically allocate data to different nodes for storage, thus realizing distributed storage.
