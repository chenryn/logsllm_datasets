### What do you see as an issue?
The documentation for the template variable `data_interval_end` states simply
that its the "End of the data interval". Initially I took that to mean the
final second/microsecond (depending on precision) of the data interval, but
its actually the start of the next interval.
For example, given a schedule that runs every 5 minutes, the variables are set
as follows (for a simple test I just ran):
  * **data_interval_start** : 2022-07-28T16:15:00+00:00
  * **data_interval_end** : 2022-07-28T16:20:00+00:00
As opposed to:
  * **data_interval_start** : 2022-07-28T16:15:00+00:00
  * **data_interval_end** : 2022-07-28T16:19:59+00:00
It makes sense as implemented, but I'd like to see the documentation state the
behavior explicitly.
### Solving the problem
The documentation I read when using the template variables is
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/templates-ref.html
I'm not sure how to word it, but it would be helpful to indicate that
`data_interval_end` is effectively the `data_interval_start` of the next
interval. Or that the interval the DAG is operating on, using mathematical
interval notation, is `[data_interval_start, data_interval_end)`
### Anything else
Just an explanation of how we ran into this:
We are running DAGS periodically that pull timeseries data from some API. The
jobs query an api with filters like this:
  * timestamp >= data_interval_start
  * timestamp = data_interval_start
  * timestamp < data_interval_end
