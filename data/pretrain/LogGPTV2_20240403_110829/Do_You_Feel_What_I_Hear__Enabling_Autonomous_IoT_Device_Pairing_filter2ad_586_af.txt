machine static, while varying the stepping positions from 1-
6m. Figure 17 depicts an example plot of signals captured
at 1-4m distances between the simultaneous events. At 1m
distance, the signals differ signiﬁcantly from those generated
by the coffee machine and footsteps in isolation, while at
4m distance, the signal characteristics are closer to those of
a coffee machine in isolation. We see that many overlapping
signals will lead to new event clusters of their own, rather
than with existing event types.
Ad-hoc networking. Perceptio provides a novel solution
to secure ad-hoc connectivity among IoT devices, without
the need for a trusted home gateway. Many applications
may beneﬁt from such ad-hoc networks due to reduced
communication and computational overhead, as it no longer
requires going through a central gateway or cloud. In fact,
there is a push in the industry to shift from star to mesh
topologies, as seen by industry activities such as Thread [30].
Resourceful attackers. Through our evaluation, we
demonstrated the difﬁculty of the attacker succeeding in
Shamming–Eavesdropping attack due to the need to consis-
tently detect events inside the home. However, as deﬁned
in our threat model in Section III, if an attacker launches

Fig. 17: When events coffee and footsteps occur simultane-
ously, the combined signals are distorted signiﬁcantly enough
to possibly cluster into a new event type of its own. However,
the magnitude of this distortion also depends on distance
between event sources.
Shamming–Signal Injection attack by creating and injecting
events from outside that are consistent and loud enough
to be sensed from legitimate devices inside the house, the
attacker may succeed in fooling the legitimate device to pair.
However, due to the same attenuation factor that protects
inside events from the external attacker, it would be difﬁcult
for inside devices to consistently detect outside events unless
they are extremely loud, otherwise the ﬁngerprints would
not match. To make this attack harder, Perceptio’s Key
Strengthening Process requires multiple iterations that take
enough time that such injections would be easily noticed
by human users, making the attack extremely risky and
likely impractical. Furthermore, our threat model also deﬁnes
Shamming–Sensor Spooﬁng attack by injecting spooﬁng
signals to sensors of legitimate devices similar to prior
work [70], [72], [67], [68]. While such attacks may still be
possible, Perceptio would cluster injected signals into another
event type. Hence, the attacker would only slow down the Key
Strengthening Process. Furthermore, such injection attacks
require a high amplitude signal to be exerted to the sensor,
which is rather difﬁcult in our setting as signals attenuate
signiﬁcantly through the wall as our experiments have shown.
IX. LIMITATIONS
We present some of the limitations of our work and discuss
how they can be improved in future.
Devices located in different rooms. Perceptio is poten-
tially unable to establish trust between valid devices located
in different rooms of a smart home. A possible remedy is
to introduce a bridging device in each room to facilitate
cross-room connections. A bridging device would be like
any other IoT device, but with the additional functionality
for human-in-the-loop pairing. For example, two infrared-
and NFC-enabled motion detectors in different rooms may
be ﬁrst manually paired by the user (e.g., via NFC tagging
with a smartphone) and then deployed to each room. Devices
in each room can leverage the Transitivity-of-Trust (ToT)
protocol (Section V) via the bridging devices to pair with
devices in other rooms. Manually bootstrapping bridging
devices is reasonable because there are only as many bridging
devices as rooms in the home. This is analogous to distributed
WiFi systems that use multiple APs to provide or enhance
connectivity through a large home [28], [62], [21].
Calibration. Perceptio depends on sensor calibration and
determination with respect to appropriate threshold values
presented in Section VI-A. Thresholding is important to helps
distinguish signals from noise and is thus critical with respect
to factors such as sensor placement, sampling rate, and events
in the environment. Hence,
in practice, Perceptio would
require a calibration phase by allowing the IoT devices to
perform local sensor calibrations for a given amount of time
prior to starting the Perceptio protocol. Device manufacturers
could also provide course-grained pre-calibrated settings.
Public and Shared Spaces. Perceptio is based on the
assumption that physical boundaries draw natural barriers
between the legitimate devices and the attacker’s device
outside, which may not hold for public spaces such as
public libraries or shopping malls. However, with further
work on ﬁne tuning thresholding parameters, Perceptio can
be extended from single family housing to other multi-tenant
private ofﬁce buildings with existing access control policies.
Frequency of activity vs. Pairing time. The pairing time
between devices is directly proportional to the frequency of
activities in the house. However, there may be households
with less family members and thereby decreased sensor activ-
ity, leading to undesirably long pairing times. In such cases,
users may introduce a signal injecting device (as presented in
Section IV-A) for faster convergence. This solution, however,
trades procurement cost and usability for speed.
X. CONCLUSION
We propose Perceptio for autonomous, secure pairing
of IoT devices using context information from embedded
sensors. The novelty of Perceptio stems from its ability to
address the difﬁcult challenge of context-based pairing across
devices equipped with different types of sensors. Perceptio
achieves this goal by abstracting sensor measurements and
using timing information as an invariant property to generate
context ﬁngerprints as a source of shared entropy for cryp-
tographic key agreement. We demonstrate through proof-of-
concept experiments that Perceptio is able to securely pair
heterogeneous sensing devices co-located within the same
physical boundary, while rejecting potential attacker devices
placed outside.
