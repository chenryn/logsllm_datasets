### Machine Static and Signal Analysis

We conducted an experiment with a stationary machine, varying the stepping positions from 1 to 6 meters. Figure 17 illustrates the signals captured at distances of 1 to 4 meters between simultaneous events. At a distance of 1 meter, the signals significantly differ from those generated by the coffee machine and footsteps in isolation. In contrast, at 4 meters, the signal characteristics are more similar to those of the coffee machine alone. Our findings suggest that overlapping signals can form new event clusters rather than merging with existing event types.

### Ad-hoc Networking

Perceptio introduces a novel solution for secure ad-hoc connectivity among IoT devices, eliminating the need for a trusted home gateway. This approach reduces communication and computational overhead, as it no longer requires routing through a central gateway or cloud. The industry is increasingly moving from star to mesh topologies, as evidenced by initiatives like Thread [30].

### Resourceful Attackers

Our evaluation demonstrated the difficulty of a Shamming–Eavesdropping attack due to the requirement of consistently detecting events inside the home. However, as defined in our threat model (Section III), if an attacker launches a Shamming–Signal Injection attack by creating and injecting consistent and loud enough events from outside, they may succeed in fooling legitimate devices into pairing. The same attenuation factor that protects inside events from external attackers also makes it challenging for inside devices to detect outside events unless they are extremely loud. Perceptio’s Key Strengthening Process, which requires multiple iterations over a sufficient time, would make such injections easily noticeable by human users, rendering the attack impractical. Additionally, our threat model includes Shamming–Sensor Spooﬁng attacks, where spooﬁng signals are injected into sensors of legitimate devices. While possible, Perceptio would cluster these injected signals into a new event type, thereby only slowing down the Key Strengthening Process. High-amplitude signals required for such attacks are difficult to achieve due to significant signal attenuation through walls, as shown in our experiments.

### Limitations

#### Devices in Different Rooms
Perceptio may struggle to establish trust between valid devices located in different rooms of a smart home. A potential solution is to introduce a bridging device in each room to facilitate cross-room connections. These bridging devices, similar to other IoT devices, would have additional functionality for human-in-the-loop pairing. For example, two infrared- and NFC-enabled motion detectors in different rooms could be manually paired by the user (e.g., via NFC tagging with a smartphone) and then deployed. Devices in each room can leverage the Transitivity-of-Trust (ToT) protocol (Section V) via the bridging devices to pair with devices in other rooms. Manually bootstrapping bridging devices is reasonable, as there are typically as many bridging devices as rooms in the home. This is analogous to distributed WiFi systems that use multiple access points to provide or enhance connectivity in large homes [28], [62], [21].

#### Calibration
Perceptio relies on sensor calibration and threshold determination, as described in Section VI-A. Thresholding is crucial for distinguishing signals from noise and depends on factors such as sensor placement, sampling rate, and environmental events. In practice, Perceptio would require a calibration phase, allowing IoT devices to perform local sensor calibrations for a specified period before initiating the Perceptio protocol. Device manufacturers could also provide coarse-grained pre-calibrated settings.

#### Public and Shared Spaces
Perceptio assumes that physical boundaries create natural barriers between legitimate devices and external attackers, which may not hold in public spaces like libraries or shopping malls. However, with further fine-tuning of threshold parameters, Perceptio can be extended from single-family housing to multi-tenant private office buildings with existing access control policies.

#### Frequency of Activity vs. Pairing Time
The pairing time between devices is directly proportional to the frequency of activities in the house. Households with fewer family members and thus lower sensor activity may experience undesirably long pairing times. In such cases, users can introduce a signal-injecting device (as presented in Section IV-A) for faster convergence, though this solution trades procurement cost and usability for speed.

### Conclusion

We propose Perceptio for autonomous, secure pairing of IoT devices using context information from embedded sensors. Perceptio's novelty lies in its ability to address the challenge of context-based pairing across devices with different types of sensors. By abstracting sensor measurements and using timing information as an invariant property to generate context fingerprints, Perceptio achieves secure pairing of co-located heterogeneous sensing devices while rejecting potential attacker devices placed outside.
