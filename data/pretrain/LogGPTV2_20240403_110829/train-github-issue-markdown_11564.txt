As we transition to using Docker setup as the default for local clusters, it is important to ensure that Hyperkube is up to date.

For clarity and actionability, consider adding a specific request or task, such as:

- Could one of you please verify the current version of Hyperkube and initiate an update if necessary?
- Please also review and confirm the compatibility with our new Docker setup. 

This will help in clearly assigning responsibilities and ensuring that the necessary steps are taken.
