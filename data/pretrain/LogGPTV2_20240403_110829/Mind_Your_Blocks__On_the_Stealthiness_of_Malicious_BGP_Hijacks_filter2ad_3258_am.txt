Episode 1: From February until May 2013
(C.1) Out of 2,620 short-lived hijacked IP preﬁxes, 58
have sent spam emails to our spamtraps between February and
May 2013. Figure 6 shows the BGP announcements, spam and
blacklisted spam sources related to a sample of 25 out of 58
short-lived hijacked IP preﬁxes. The ﬁgure highlights:
•
•
the strong temporal correlation between BGP an-
nouncements and spam, and
the low number of IP address blocks (7 out of 58)
blacklisted by Spamhaus before the end of the hijack.
A total of 4,149 spam emails were received from the short-
lived hijacked IP address blocks. We extracted from this
spam all advertised URLs that were pointing to 1,174 unique

BGP announcements, spam emails and blacklisted spam sources
related to long-lived hijacked IP address ranges. For the sake of conciseness,
only the 10 out of 35 IP address ranges that sent spam to our spamtraps or
were blacklisted are depicted.
1) Long-lived hijacks
In this section we analyse more closely the 35 long-lived
hijacks (out of the total 2,655 hijacks) we identiﬁed according
to the ﬁve characteristics described above.
(C.1) Figure 5(5) shows the spam and blacklisted spam
sources along with BGP announcements related to long-lived
hijacked IP preﬁxes. Since those IP preﬁxes were not an-
nounced before or after being hijacked, the BGP announce-
ments shown here all relate to the time of the hijacks. We
can see that six out of 35 IP address ranges sent spam to
our spamtraps. A total of 815 spam emails were sent from IP
addresses scattered throughout each of the long-lived hijacked
IP address blocks. Spam was mainly received at the start of
the hijack period. No IP source was found to be blacklisted at
the time the spam was received.
networks
and
91.198.40.0/24) out of
the 35 became blacklisted by
Spamhaus within two days after they became hijacked and
we observed spam originating from them. In these cases,
blacklists appear to have reacted quickly. Four additional
networks which have not sent spam to our spamtraps also
became blacklisted, although it took more time for them to
appear on a blacklist. For two of them (61.45.251.0/24 and
115.85.133.0/24) it took 2 weeks and the hijack was over
by the time they appeared on a blacklist. For the other two
(91.220.63.0/24 and 192.12.131.0/24) it took one month and
2 months respectively before they appeared on a blacklist.

(C.2) 26 IP preﬁxes out of 35 were never announced on the
Internet before they were hijacked. The 9 others were hijacked
on average one year after remaining unadvertised for at least
one day, and maximum three years and two months.
5Disclaimer: IP address blocks and ASes were likely abused in hijacks
between January 2013 and June 2014 and, therefore, might now be legitimately
used.

Episode 2: From June 2013 until June 2014
While examining the short-lived hijacks in the ﬁrst pe-
riod, we uncovered an intriguing phenomenon in the hijacks
performed during the second period, between June 2013 and
June 2014. This phenomenon is signiﬁcant since it includes
2,562 short-lived hijacks representing 97.8% of all short-lived
hijacks identiﬁed. Figure 7 depicts a sample of 87 (out of
2,562) hijacks that occurred in June 2014 and shows that:
