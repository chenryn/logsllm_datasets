### Title: Fuzzing and Exploiting Virtual Channels in Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol for Fun and Profit

**Abstract:**

The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, enabling users to remotely control Windows systems with a graphical user interface (GUI) over a network. RDP is widely used by IT administrators and non-technical users for remote access and management of Hyper-V virtual machines. Due to its extensive use, the RDP client is included by default in most Windows operating systems (from XP onwards) and is also available on other platforms such as Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.

In this presentation, we will share our experience in applying coverage-based fuzzing to the RDP client, with a specific focus on virtual channels. Virtual channels in RDP handle complex functionalities such as sound, graphics (GDI and RemoteFX), USB, filesystem, and smart card operations, which often involve parsing and allocating dynamic data. Given the complexity of these functions, we targeted virtual channels with the goal of discovering numerous crashes.

To achieve this, we first analyzed the binary of Microsoft's official RDP client (mstsc.exe) to understand how virtual channels and the RDP server-client interaction work. We then adapted WinAFL, a popular fuzzer, to efficiently fuzz virtual channels while leveraging code-coverage feedback. This approach led to the discovery of several exploitable crashes, and we successfully achieved remote code execution (RCE) on Windows clients by exploiting the identified vulnerabilities.

In addition to detailing the construction of the fuzzer and demonstrating the exploitation process, we will also discuss a heap memory management technique called "RDP Heap Feng Shui." This technique is essential for exploiting heap overflow vulnerabilities in the RDP client.

**Key Points:**
1. **Introduction to RDP:**
   - Overview of the Remote Desktop Protocol.
   - Common use cases and platforms supported.

2. **Fuzzing Setup:**
   - Analysis of mstsc.exe binary.
   - Adaptation of WinAFL for efficient fuzzing of virtual channels.
