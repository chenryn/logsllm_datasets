### Title: BlackHat US-19: Process Injection Techniques - Gotta Catch Them All

**Abstract:**

In the realm of Windows process injection, it was commonly believed that only 6-7 fundamental techniques existed. However, our research in late 2018 revealed a much more extensive landscape. We identified and analyzed over 20 distinct techniques, gathered from various sources including websites, blogs, and academic papers. This led us to ask: where is the ultimate, comprehensive collection of "Windows process injection" techniques?

In this presentation, we present the most exhaustive and up-to-date collection of Windows process injection techniques. This resource is the first of its kind, covering nearly all known true injection methods. Our focus is on Windows 10 x64, specifically addressing injections from one running 64-bit medium-integrity process to another, without privilege elevation. We also pay special attention to new Windows protection technologies such as Control Flow Guard (CFG) and Code Integrity Guard (CIG).

We differentiate between memory write primitives and execution techniques, and discuss various memory allocation strategies. Each technique in our collection has been curated, analyzed, and tabulated, with straightforward, research-grade Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code. We have tested each technique against Windows 10 x64, both with and without protections, and provide detailed reports on the requirements, limitations, and unique characteristics of each method.

Additionally, no BlackHat presentation would be complete without introducing new attacks. We describe a novel memory writing primitive that is agnostic to CFG. We also introduce a new "stack bombing" execution method, which, despite the inherent risks of stack overwriting, is designed to be inherently safe.

Finally, we offer a mix-and-match library of all memory write primitives and execution methods, allowing users to create customized process injection solutions tailored to their specific needs.
