**Is there an exception in the log, what is the reason for the exception, and how can it be resolved?**

**Log Entry:**
```
Jun 14 15:16:02 combo sshd(pam_unix)[19937]: check pass; user unknown
```

**Analysis:**

- **Exception Detected:** Yes
- **Exception Type:** Security Exception (User Not Found)
- **Description:** The log entry indicates that at 15:16:02 on June 14, the SSH daemon (sshd) encountered an issue during the authentication process. Specifically, the system attempted to authenticate a user who does not exist in the system. This could be an indication of an unauthorized access attempt.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Review User Accounts:**
   - Verify all user accounts on the server to ensure that no unauthorized accounts are present.
   - Remove any accounts that are not recognized or should not have access.

2. **Check SSH Configuration:**
   - Review the SSH configuration file (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to ensure it is properly configured.
   - Consider implementing additional security measures such as:
     - Disabling root login via SSH.
     - Limiting access to specific users or groups.
     - Enforcing strong password policies or using key-based authentication.

3. **Monitor and Audit:**
   - Enable and review SSH logs regularly to detect and respond to any suspicious activity.
   - Consider setting up alerts for failed login attempts and other security events.

By taking these steps, you can enhance the security of your server and prevent unauthorized access.
