### System Information
- Playwright Version: v1.33.0
- Operating System: M1 macOS 13.3.1 (a)
- Browser: WebKit (Safari)
- Other Info: The issue appears to be related to the browser running in full-screen mode.

### Issue Description
I am encountering two related issues when running tests with Playwright on Safari (WebKit). 

1. **Browser Context Closure Failure**: When running the test, the `after` hook fails to close the browser context.
2. **Segmentation Fault in Debug Mode**: When running the test in debug mode, a segmentation fault error occurs. This happens approximately half the time.

The application under test is expected to run in full-screen mode, which I believe contributes to these errors. The test should run in headless mode, but it always runs with the browser window open. For comparison, other tests on different websites run headless without any issues.

#### Config File (`playwright.config.ts`)
```javascript
module.exports = defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests/e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: 'html',
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Test File (`test.spec.ts`)
```javascript
test('should pass intros', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://roar-swr-demo.web.app/');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Continue' }).click();
  await page.getByText('Press ANY KEY to continue').press('ArrowRight');
  await page.getByText('Press ANY KEY to continue').press('ArrowRight');
  await page.getByText('Press ANY KEY to practice').press('ArrowRight');
  const arrows = page.getByAltText('arrow-key');
  expect(arrows).toBeDefined();
});
```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a new app using `npx create-roar-app@latest my-roar-app` (refer to [Create Roar App documentation](https://yeatmanlab.github.io/create-roar-app/developer-guide/installation/)).
2. Install Playwright with `npm init playwright@latest`.
3. Add an e2e folder with the test.
4. Run the tests with `npx playwright test` and `npx playwright test --debug`.

### Expected Behavior
- **Normal Test Command (`npx playwright test`)**: The test should pass, run in headless mode, and successfully close the browser context.
- **Debug Test Command (`npx playwright test --debug`)**: The test should pass, run in headless mode, and successfully close the browser context.

### Actual Behavior
- **Normal Test Command**: The test runs in headful mode (should be headless) and hangs until the timeout occurs. The same behavior is observed both in and out of full-screen mode.
- **Debug Test Command**: The test passes but hangs on a black screen (due to being in full-screen mode). Pressing escape generates the HTML report and shows the segmentation fault error.
