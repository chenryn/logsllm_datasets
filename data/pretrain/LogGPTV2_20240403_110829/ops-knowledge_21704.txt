User: Please introduce the transaction in SQL database in detail, including the definition, characteristics, isolation level of transaction, concurrency control of transaction and how to ensure data consistency.
Assistant: A transaction is an operation unit in the database, which is a complete work task and can be composed of multiple sub-operations. The characteristics of transactions include atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. Transaction isolation levels include read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read, and serialization. Concurrency control of transactions can be realized through lock mechanism, concurrency control algorithm, etc. In order to ensure data consistency, SQL databases can also use techniques such as constraints, triggers, and logs.
