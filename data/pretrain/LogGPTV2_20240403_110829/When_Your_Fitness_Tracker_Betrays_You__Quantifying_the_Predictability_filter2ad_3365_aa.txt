Abstract—Attacks on behavioral biometrics have become in-
creasingly popular. Most research has been focused on pre-
senting a previously obtained feature vector to the biometric
sensor, often by the attacker training themselves to change
their behavior to match that of the victim. However, obtaining
the victim’s biometric information may not be easy, especially
when the user’s template on the authentication device is
adequately secured. As such, if the authentication device is
inaccessible, the attacker may have to obtain data elsewhere.
In this paper, we present an analytic framework that en-
ables us to measure how easily features can be predicted based
on data gathered in a different context (e.g., different sensor,
performed task or environment). This framework is used to
assess how resilient individual features or entire biometrics
are against such cross-context attacks. In order to be able
to compare existing biometrics with regard to this property,
we perform a user study to gather biometric data from 30
participants and ﬁve biometrics (ECG, eye movements, mouse
movements, touchscreen dynamics and gait) in a variety of
contexts. We make this dataset publicly available online.
Our results show that many attack scenarios are viable
in practice as features are easily predicted from a variety of
contexts. All biometrics include features that are particularly
predictable (e.g., amplitude features for ECG or curvature
for mouse movements). Overall, we observe that cross-context
attacks on eye movements, mouse movements and touchscreen
inputs are comparatively easy while ECG and gait exhibit
much more chaotic cross-context changes.
1. Introduction
Biometric authentication is a popular approach to ad-
dress the shortcomings of passwords (e.g., bad memorability
and password reuse). The most common approaches are
ﬁngerprint scanning and face recognition, both of which
are used in scenarios ranging from smartphone security to
border controls. However, both can easily be observed and
replicated by an attacker, resulting in a security vulnerabil-
ity. Fingerprints are easily lifted off smooth surfaces (such
as coffee mugs) or captured through high-resolution pho-
tographs. 2D photos of a victim’s face are readily available
through social media proﬁles. In addition, ﬁngerprints in
particular require specialized sensors.
In recent years, behavioral biometrics using commodity
sensors have become a popular research subject. The oldest
examples are keystroke dynamics (distinctive typing pat-
terns) and mouse movement biometrics. With the increasing
prevalence of smartphones and tablets, the distinctiveness
of touchscreen usage patterns has been investigated. Human
gait has also been demonstrated to be distinctive, its partic-
ular appeal lies in the fact that it is easily captured through
cheap accelerometers which are nowadays provided in most
smartphones and smartwatches.
threat model,
While these biometrics are often initially evaluated un-
der a zero-effort
the research community
has recently been more focused on active attacks. Typical
attacks are two-fold: (i) the attacker obtains the victim’s
biometric information and (ii) presents it to the authenti-
cation system. The second step can be achieved through
the attacker using the system as intended while modifying
their own behavior (manual imitation attack) or by using
some technical contraption (robotic imitation attack). Most
documented attacks have been focused on the second part
of the attack (i.e., presenting previously obtained data to the
authentication system). In this paper, we more thoroughly
investigate challenges involved in the attacker obtaining the
victim’s biometric information in the ﬁrst place.
Lots of attention has been given to the protection of
biometric templates, not only for security but also for
privacy reasons (templates are sensitive user data). As a
result, most biometric authentication systems implement
strong measures to protect the user’s template. A classic
example is using secure enclaves to store the templates (e.g.,
Apple Touch ID1). As secure elements offer good security
guarantees (i.e., they are hard to bypass), attackers will
likely need to obtain the victim’s biometric data elsewhere.
The key challenge lies in the fact that the distribution of
biometric features strongly depends not just on the user, but
also on the context of the measurement. We use the term
context to refer to all the factors that inﬂuence the outcome
of a biometric signal measurement. Some of these factors

have been already identiﬁed by Jain et al. [1]: the authors
ﬁnd that sensor limitations, type of task and environmental
changes all inﬂuence the measurement, making it noisier.
Figure 1a shows how the context of the gait biometric is
expressed through the location of the sensor on the user’s
body (pocket or arm) and walking style (walk or jog). Sim-
ilarly, Figure 1b shows the difference in the voltage of ECG
waves when the measurement occurs in different contexts:
depending on the placement of electrodes on the user’s body
(either wrist, arms and legs, or chest), or the type of activity
(rest or walk). Due to these feature differences, an attacker
using an arbitrary source of biometric information for their
attack (akin to a replay attack in network security) will be
unlikely to succeed. However, differences between contexts
may be partly systematic, i.e., consistent and predictable for
a large number of users.
Key Research Questions.
• How can attackers obtain biometric information without
compromising the template on the authentication device?
• Are context-speciﬁc changes in features systematic and
can they be predicted?
• How does this predictability impact the security of bio-
metric authentication?
To answer these questions, we generalize the methodology
of [2] to formalize an approach to automatically derive a
cross-context feature mapping based on population data. The
mapping then enables us to score both individual features
and biometrics with regard to their predictability across
contexts. Unpredictable features contribute to the overall
biometric’s security guarantees, as the attacker struggles
to collect useful biometric information outside the context
where the authentication occurs. The unpredictability score
gives more information than the attack success rate, which
depends on the speciﬁc implementation of a biometric sys-
tem (e.g., matching algorithm, decision thresholds). Instead,
this measure of security enables not just the comparison of
different biometrics, but also to harden feature-sets to be
more resilient against this attack. We use our methodology
to assess and compare the security of ﬁve biometrics: gait,
touchscreen dynamics, ECG, eye movements and mouse
movements. We collect data through a user study involving
30 participants providing data for all biometrics in different
contexts across two sessions. We choose contexts to reﬂect
a variety of real-world threat scenarios.
Contributions.
• We identify a number of scenarios that enable attackers
to gain access to sources of biometric information.
• We provide an analytical framework that measures to
what degree biometric features can be predicted across
different contexts.
• We conduct a two-sessions study on 30 users in order to
collect ﬁve behavioral biometrics (gait, touch dynamics,
ECG, eye and mouse movements) across a variety of
contexts. We make this dataset publicly available2.
• Based on this dataset, we use our framework to quantify
the predictability of the ﬁve biometrics’ features and
discuss the resulting security implications.
Organization. The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows: In Section 2 we summarize related work dealing
with biometric authentication systems and attacks on these.
Section 3 outlines the threat model we use throughout the
paper. Section 4 details how our data collection methodol-
ogy is built on the threat model. Section 5 describes the
mathematical foundation of the cross-context mapping; the
results of applying this mapping to our dataset can be found
in Section 6. We conclude the paper in Section 7.

2.1. Biometric Authentication
Frank et al. were amongst the ﬁrst to investigate the
feasibility of using touchscreen input patterns for user au-
thentication on smartphones [3]. They collect data through
an image comparison game which requires users to swipe
between images, with each swipe (or stroke) generating a
single feature vector. The feature-set is composed of the
pressure distribution across the swipe, the start and stop
coordinates, the swipe’s curvature as well as speed and
acceleration. The authors consider (horizontal) swipes and
(vertical) scrolls but argue that individual taps do not provide
meaningful biometric information. Bo et al. show that a
device’s micro-movements generated by the user’s operation
of the touchscreen [4] contribute further identifying infor-
mation. A recent survey of research on touchscreen input
biometrics can be found in [5].
Electrocardiography (ECG) is the process of measuring
the electrical activity of the heart. While the ECG waveform
follows a typical pattern for all healthy humans, there are
subtle differences between individuals. There is a growing
body of work investigating ECG as a biometric; recent
surveys can be found in [6], [7], [8]. The ECG signal is sub-
divided into P, Q, R, S and T waves. The main features focus
on the (relative) amplitudes of the waves, their duration
and the spacing between their peaks. Research on ECG
biometrics has also resulted in a commercial product, the
Nymi Band3, which serves as a multi-factor authenticator.
Human gait (walking style) has garnered increased inter-
est by the research community in recent years. Information
about a person’s gait can either be obtained through videos
or accelerometers carried by the person. The latter is par-
ticularly compelling for continuous authentication on per-
sonal electronics, as accelerometers are near-ubiquitous in
smartwatches, smartphones and a plethora of wearables. For
accelerometer-based gait biometrics, the signal is typically
ﬁrst divided into cycles to isolate individual steps. Following
that, features are obtained by dividing the reference cycle
into segments, with each feature representing the accelera-
tion within the corresponding segment [9]. Often, dynamic
time warping is used to adjust for noise in the movement
before template matching [9]. An overview of state-of-the-
art approaches to gait recognition can be found in [10].
Optical eye trackers are available as stand-alone devices,
but are also increasingly integrated in mobile devices. Track-
ing is typically achieved by shining a pattern of infrared light
on the user’s eyes and capturing the reﬂection of the cornea.
Therefore, an eye tracker only requires a standard webcam
with an attached source of infrared light, although a higher
number of frames per second is needed for higher sampling
rates. While eye tracking has been used in the past for
medical diagnosis (for disorders such as Alzheimer’s [11]
and schizophrenia [12]), it has recently attracted signiﬁcant
interest as a biometric. Earlier work authenticates users
while they are being shown controlled stimuli, such as
images [13] or moving shapes [14]. Eberz et al. authenticate

users while they perform standard computer tasks (reading,
typing, browsing and watching videos) [15]. Their feature-
set consists of temporal features reﬂecting short-term speed
and acceleration, spatial features that measure the steadiness
of the gaze and the changes of the pupil diameter. Their
results show that
training and operating the system on
different tasks is possible, but that features show varying
degrees of task dependence which leads to higher error rates.
Using distinctive mouse movements for authentica-
tion has garnered signiﬁcant attention due to the near-
ubiquitousness of mice in desktop environments. A survey
of mouse movement biometrics can be found in [16]. Key
features reﬂect the speed of mouse movements, their cur-
vature and properties of mouse clicks (e.g., click duration).
The click duration in particular has been shown to depend
on the physical device [17].
2.2. Imitation Attacks
Typically, biometrics are evaluated under a zero-effort
threat model, any successful attacks are then a result of the
attacker’s biometric features being sufﬁciently similar to the
victim’s template. With the growing interest in behavioral
biometrics, researchers have turned towards more sophisti-
cated attacks. These imitation (also known as mimicry [23])
attacks can be divided into two categories: manual imitation
attacks and robotic imitation attacks. The former involves an
attacker using the system as intended while modifying their
own behavior to match that of the victim. For the latter,
the attack is not carried out by a human but is instead
automated. This approach may make it necessary to defeat
any liveness detection a system may have and is also usually
trivial to spot by a human observer. A summary of attacks
on biometric systems is given in Table 1.
Tey et al. demonstrate a manual imitation attack against
password authentication that has been hardened through
keystroke dynamics [18]. As such, the user has to type in
the correct password with the correct inter-key timings. The
authors assume the attacker has full knowledge of the model
(i.e., possesses both the password and the timing template).
Users are trained to act as attackers and are provided with a
training interface that gives positive and negative feedback
depending on their closeness to the actual victim’s timings.
Khan et al. develop a similar system to attack touch-
screen input authentication [19]. They investigate two sce-
narios,
the ﬁrst one involves the attacker observing the
victim’s template via shouldersurﬁng, the second assumes
perfect information gained by the attacker tricking the victim

on population data that accounts for device-speciﬁc feature

context mapping presented in Section 5.

into using a compromised device. Similar to Tey et al.’s
work, attackers are trained through an interface giving them
feedback before they carry out the actual attack.
Serwadda et al. showcase a robotic imitation attack
against the touchscreen biometric [20] (see Figure 2). The
swipes on the victim’s phone are not carried out by a
human, but by a purpose-built Lego Mindstorm robot. For
the original attack, the feature vectors imitated by the robot
are derived from population data, rather than the speciﬁc
victim. This approach signiﬁcantly increased the system’s
false accept rate, although the baseline equal error rate is
already much higher than that of related work. The authors
also consider a targeted attack, for which they assume the
attacker has obtained a perfect copy of (some) of the victim’s
feature vectors [21].
Rajesh et al. develop a manual imitation attack against
the gait biometric [22]. They assume that the attacker has
obtained the victim’s biometric template. Using a treadmill,
the attacker can modify step length, step width, speed and
thigh lift while carrying out the attack. As most gait features
are highly dependent on these four gait characteristics, the
use of the treadmill makes the attack very effective.
The previous attacks assume that the attacker has ob-
tained a perfect copy of the victim’s template (see Table 1).
However, assuming the actual template is stored securely,
this may not always be a safe assumption as the attacker may
only be able to sample the victim’s biometric in a different
context (e.g., different device or environment). Eberz et al.
demonstrate an attack on ECG biometrics that considers
different sources of information for the attacker, including e-
health and medical devices [2]. The victim’s data is injected
into the authentication system by using a standard audio
player as a signal generator. Their work shows that the
distribution of ECG features depends on the measurement
device and that the success rate of the attack drops when
data is not obtained on the actual authentication device. To
mitigate this, the authors propose a mapping function based
In this paper we focus on adversaries that attempt to
bypass a biometric authentication system using incomplete
biometric information about the victim from another context
and combining it with population data.
Overview. Figure 3 shows an example of such a scenario.
The victim is enrolled into a gait authentication system
through their phone. We refer to the system and the context
used by the system as target. The system maintains a
conﬁdence in the user’s identity based on their gait patterns
and allows certain sensitive operations (e.g., authorising
payments) only when the conﬁdence is above a threshold.
The victim’s biometric template is stored on the phone in a
trusted module that cannot be accessed by the adversary.
The adversary knows that the victim uses a smartwatch
that monitors their gait, for example for health or sport
reasons. We refer to the context of the smartwatch as source.
Either the smartwatch, its connected smartphone application
or the wireless link are insecure and the adversary exploits
the smartwatch to obtain the victim’s gait data. However,
as previously illustrated in Figure 1a, the smartwatch data
cannot be used directly to impersonate the user at the target
system, because of feature differences caused by the differ-
ent context. Therefore, the adversary collects biometric data
from a population (which excludes the victim), reproducing
the source and target contexts. Using only population data,
the adversary attempts to learn how to transform gait data
from source to target and uses this information to transform
the stolen victim’s gait. The transformed data allow the
adversary to impersonate the victim at target.
Assumptions. The victim is enrolled into a biometric au-
thentication system (target). The biometric data used by the
target system is measured in a pre-deﬁned context (target
context). The attacker wants to impersonate the victim at
target system. We assume the following:
• Obtaining the victim’s biometric data usable in target
context is hard, because the devices that process target
system data are highly protected;
892

• The victim uses another system that makes use of the
same type of biometric data as target, we refer to this
as source system. Data from source are more easily
obtainable, but are measured in a different context
(source context);
• The adversary can obtain biometric data from a popu-
lation for source and target contexts (i.e., same sensor,
task, environment, etc.);
• The adversary knows the biometric features used for
recognition by target system, but does not know any
other detail used by the recognition algorithm;
• The adversary can reconstruct biometric signals from
biometric templates and can inject forged biometric
data into target system.
It should be noted that the biometric data for source and
target can either be raw biometric signals or vectors of
biometric features. In fact, since the adversary knows the
feature extraction algorithm used by the system, they can
easily compute features from raw signals.
The adversaries may obtain population data in different
ways. As an example, they could ask their friends to provide
their biometric samples, or invite members of the general
public for a lab study. For some biometrics, it might also
be possible to use publicly available data (e.g., medical
databases for ECG). Although the adversary may need to
invest time and effort in collecting the population data, it is
a worthwhile investment. In fact, once the universal transfor-
mation is learned, the adversary can use it to impersonate
potentially anyone. In the case of local authentication the
adversary will have to obtain physical access to the device
and, depending on the method of injection, bypass liveness
detection. On the other hand, if authentication is performed
remotely (i.e., on a server), the adversary can perform the
attack in a more scalable way.
In the following subsections, we motivate the threat
model by presenting different scenarios for each of the bio-
metrics. In each scenario, we outline how different factors
contribute to the feature differences between contexts.
3.1. Gait
Little attention is being given to the conﬁdentiality of
accelerometer-based gait data. At the time of writing, ac-
cessing the accelerometer does not require a permission in
the Android Manifest ﬁle (Android v8.0), and can be ac-
cessed directly by websites, through the DeviceMotion API.
This means that adversaries might obtain control of an ap-
plication (or make an application or website themselves) and
silently collect data from oblivious users. Furthermore, most
ﬁtness trackers have been proven vulnerable to exploits, both
in the wireless channel [24] or in the ﬁrmware [25].
With the adversary being more likely to obtain data from
a ﬁtness tracker (or a ﬁtness application running on the
smartphone), two main factors should be considered. The
ﬁrst one is the on-body location of the accelerometer sensor
and the second one is the type of movement: either walking
or running. The rationale behind the location is that different
