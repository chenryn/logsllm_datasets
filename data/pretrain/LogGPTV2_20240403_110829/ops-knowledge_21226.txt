User: I'm trying to run a sample Theano code that uses GPU on windows.
My python (with python-dev and Theano and all required libraries) was installed from Anaconda.
This is the error I run into:
Cannot open include file: 'Python.h': No such file or directory
My Python.h is actually in c://Anaconda/include/
I'm guessing that I should add that directory to some environmental variable, but I don't know which.
Assistant: If you are using Visual Studio in Windows, right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and navigate as follows: Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories -> Add C:/Anaconda/include/ (or wherever your Anaconda install is located)
