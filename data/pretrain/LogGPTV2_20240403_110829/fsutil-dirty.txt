Parameters

Queries the specified volume's dirty bit.
set
Sets the specified volume's dirty bit.

Remarks
A volume's dirty bit indicates that the file system may be in an inconsistent state. The dirty bit can be set because:
The volume is online and it has outstanding changes.
Changes were made to the volume and the computer was shut down before the changes were committed to the disk.
Corruption was detected on the volume.
If the dirty bit is set when the computer restarts, chkdsk runs to verify the file system integrity and to attempt to fix any issues with the volume.

Volume C: is dirty
If the volume isn't dirty, the following output displays: Volume C: is not dirty
