biometric data which are no more accurate or considered to be incomplete are
erased, canceled or rectiﬁed.
Minimization and Limitation. Minimization determines both the amount of
the biometric data and the scope of the biometric applications. Data usage should
be limited to what is necessary while biometrics must be collected for speciﬁed,
explicit and legitimate purposes. The biometric references should be adequate,
relevant and limited to what is necessary. For example, the use of images for facial
recognition and the use of templates, even if they are encrypted, which include
complete ﬁngerprint information instead of minutiae points (minimal data)
are prohibited, Gray [79], Palanichamy and Marimuthu [161]. The principle
of limitation prohibits processing for the purpose of uniquely identifying a
natural person if consent has not been given explicitly. However, this procedure
is allowed in the ﬁeld of employment, social security, social protection law and
for reasons of public interest in the area of public health if the principle of
minimization is preserved. This means that if consent is not feasible for a group
of users, then additional steps are taken to address the concept of minimization
either by minimizing the use and impact of the examined biometric technology
CRYPTOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS FOR BIOMETRIC DESIGNS
37
or if this not possible by using minimal data as biometric references for user
recognition.
Anonymity. To reduce the privacy issues of linking transactions or identity
references across DBs or applications, the legal framework determines the
principle of anonymity. Anonymity can be achieved in practice by combining
the security recommendations of non-invertibility, unlinkability, cancelability
and renewability. Regarding the user, anonymity stands for the fact that he
should be indistinguishable within a set of subjects or a particular group of
individuals. The term also refers to the parties and recipients of biometric
and identity references involved in a biometric system to jointly compute a
matching process. It characterizes an unknown authorship, lacking distinction
or recognizability within the anonymity set by reducing the likelihood to be
identiﬁed as an originator, Breebaart et al. [33].
To conclude, it is underlined that the term of privacy for biometric designs is
characterized by the eﬀectiveness of the users’ control over their own personal
data. This fact is related to the properties of biometric data and to both the
security requirements and the privacy principles and how these are addressed
in a biometric architecture. Although a complete evaluation framework is still
not available, our analysis in Section 2.6 can be used as a guidance tool.
3.3 Cryptographic Mechanisms for Biometric De-
signs
This section presents the cryptographic approaches that have been proposed
to enhance the security of biometric designs. The objective of the applied
cryptography in biometric architectures is to protect pieces of personal data.
This biometric reference has to be used for comparison with another similar
yet diﬀerent template which includes the binary form of the extracted user’s
information created after the enrollment procedure, Hao et al.
[86] and
Menezes et al. [142]. However, at the matching process it should be possible to
compare unprotected with encrypted data. This fuzziness of biometric features
renders the traditional data protection techniques ineﬀective for biometric
computations, Kanade et al. [109] and Tuyls et al. [216]. Recent reports evaluate
the applicability, usability and security issues of widely used approaches (e.g.,
implicit authentication protocols) and they discuss why they are considered
impractical for high security and privacy-preserving biometric recognition
systems, Bringer et al. [35], Kaur and Khanna [111], Khan et al. [114], Pagnin
et al. [157], Safa et al. [184] and Saraswat et al. [185]. Biometric data protection
is a well covered topic in the literature. Below, we present a compact survey
38
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
on cryptographic mechanisms for secure unimodal and multimodal biometric
deployments. The overview is by no means exhaustive but it is important to
provide the reader with the background that is necessary for the remaining of
this thesis.
3.3.1 Basic Protection Techniques for Unimodal Schemes
It is noted that many authors adopt the term biometric template protection
to describe all the methodologies that can be used to protect the templates
of biometric information. However, we believe that this classiﬁcation is not
exclusive since a method can draw upon more than one approach (hybrid
protection model) in order to comply with the security requirements and privacy
principles discussed in Section 3.2. In this thesis, we use the term cryptographic
mechanisms to categorize the state-of-the-art research on secure biometric
technologies according to their functionality and purposes to eﬀectively address
the vulnerabilities presented in Section 3.1. Figure 3.2 illustrates the basic
techniques to protect the biometric references. These approaches were initially
introduced for the protection of unimodal biometric templates. We proceed
to analyze their functionality and discuss their applicability in multimodal
architectures.
Figure 3.2: Categories of the approaches for the encryption of biometrics.
Features Transformation. Biometric template protection refers to the
encryption of biometric templates including the user’s biometric references
to preclude attacks at the level of the DB, Jain et al. [100] and Ngo et al. [151].
During the enrollment phase, an algorithm transforms the data extracted
from the captured biometric features before their transfer and storage. The
transformation may have diﬀerent characteristics and use secret parameters
such as auxiliary data (AD) (e.g., key, password or PIN code). Thus, the
template stored in the DB is strongly protected in order to make it infeasible to
CRYPTOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS FOR BIOMETRIC DESIGNS
39
retrieve the genuine biometric feature from the template, Campisi [39]. For user
authentication, the new template is also transformed in the same way as the
stored template and the matching process occurs in the transformed domain.
Depending on the characteristics of the transformation, the approaches can be
further divided into non-invertible and salting methods, Choudhury et al. [52].
The ﬁrst category applies a one-way function to the unprotected data such that
it is computationally hard to recover the initial user’s biometric data. This is
also true even if some of the parameters of the transformation function would
be revealed, Lim et al. [124]. Salting transforms combine a user-speciﬁc key with
the biometrics such that the protected template cannot be obtained without
the knowledge of the key. This implies that identical biometric data sets may
lead to multiple templates. Salting methods are multi-factor approaches by
deﬁnition and the literature oﬀers several works that aim to reduce the security
issues of a potential compromise of the AD, Karabat and Topcu [110].
Cancelable Biometrics. The security requirement of cancelability in biometric
systems, is related to the privacy of the user, while it implies that the biometric
architecture should provide a mechanism for authentication even when the
biometric template is compromised or stolen, Kindt [115]. Cancelable or
revocable biometrics were introduced as the ﬁrst privacy-preserving mechanism
for biometric schemes that respect several properties for the protection of
user privacy, Ratha et al. [171]. The philosophy is more or less the same as
the non-invertible approaches of the features transformation technique. The
original biometric features are distorted intentionally and a deformed version
of the template is stored in the DB. In contrast to features transformation,
the mechanism of cancelable biometrics allows the generation of multiple
transformed biometric templates, oﬀering higher security levels and addressing
the practical issues and concerns related to linking users across diﬀerent
applications as analyzed by Bhattasali et al. in [21], Cavoukian et al. [46]
and Rathgeb and Uhl [174].
Biometric Cryptosystems. Biometric cryptosystems or crypto-biometrics
belong to the second category of privacy-preserving techniques for the protection
of biometric information. The two main models are named after their role as
key-generation and key-binding schemes, Uludag et al. [217]. In both approaches,
some public information known as helper data (HD) is transmitted and stored
to set up not only a protected storage of the templates but the complete process
of extraction and transmission. HD consist of a key bounded to a biometric
template and some supplementary information. HD are not always required
to be secret since it is computationally hard to derive any private information
about the user’s biometrics. However, their authenticity has to be protected,
Adamovic et al. [6]. For key-generation schemes, biometric features are used
to directly create a digital secret. In this approach, HD are derived from the
40
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
extracted biometric feature set and the cryptographic key is generated from
both the HD and the biometric template. The generated keys are shared with
the involved entities and they are used to secure all the communication channels.
The state-of-the-art presents a variety of approaches under the names of as
fuzzy extractors, Dodis et al. [65] and secure sketches, Linnartz and Tuyls [125]
and Sutcu et al. [201]. Key-binding cryptosystems allow only the transmission
and storage of information coming from the combination of biometric data with
randomly independent external keys. In this case, the keys are non-biometric
elements, such as a PIN, a password or a credential with certiﬁed attributes.
Crypto-biometrics rely heavily on the use of error-correcting codes to correct
errors from noise and intra-class variations, Li et al. [121]. Further analysis is
outside the scope of this thesis and we refer the interested readers to the works
of Davida et al. in [59], Sarier in [186] and Simoens et al. in [195]. It is noted
that research into this direction has oﬀered promising results regarding security
and overall performance. Key-binding approaches appear in the literature as
fuzzy commitment schemes, Ignatenko and Willems [89], fuzzy vault designs,
Juels and Sudan [107] and shielding functions, Li and Jain [122].
Pseudonymous Biometric Identities (PIs). In 2008, the partners of
TURBINE European Project [215] proposed the technique of Pseudonymous
Biometric Identities (PIs). The mechanism has been considered as a privacy-
by-design cryptographic approaches for biometric designs, Breebaart et al. [33].
It utilizes non-invertible functions, to create PIs from the user’s extracted
biometric data. For higher levels of security, the scheme requires the presence of
a password or a credential that are used as supplementary auxiliary data (AD).
Figure 3.3 presents the architecture of the extraction of the PIs from biometric
data and how the security requirements of renewability is addressed, adapted
from Delvaux et al. [62].
Figure 3.3: Pseudonymous biometric identities derived from biometric samples.
During the enrollment phase, a biometric device captures the user’s biometric
CRYPTOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS FOR BIOMETRIC DESIGNS
41
features while the user provides a password. Subsequently, an encoder generates
the PI and creates additional non-biometric helper data (HD), using as an
input only the user’s AD. This process is inspired by the functionality of crypto-
biometrics. The initial biometric information and AD are destroyed. The design
involves the parameters for the separation and individualization of the elements,
preventing impersonation and improving the security of users with very similar
characteristics, Ngo et al. [122]. HD and PI references are securely stored as
diﬀerent templates in the encrypted domain, such as a DB, card or token. During
the authentication procedure, the PI expires, while the scheme can create a
new PI for a second recognition. The authentication process can be divided
into two diﬀerent approaches, Gafurov et al. [69]. The scheme can proceed to a
direct veriﬁcation of the PI. The user presents his biometrics at the sensor and
enters the password that was presented during the enrollment phase. Given the
stored templates of the HD and the PI, a veriﬁer deﬁnes the decision result that
is communicated to the parties involved in the application. After a successful
authentication, user’s fresh biometrics and the AD are destroyed. According
to the second approach, the user presents his biometric data and provides AD.
This information and the stored template of HD are transmitted to a PI recoder,
allowing the generation of a new PI. The user’s biometric data and the given AD
are destroyed. The generated PI and the stored template of the initially created
PI are both provided to the application’s PI comparator. The ﬁnal decision is
determined by the comparison of the two PIs and the result is communicated to
the involved parties. The complete technical analysis can be found on page 100.
3.3.2 Basic Techniques in Multibiometric Schemes
As described in Section 2.5, multimodal biometrics improve the reliability of
the recognition systems and oﬀer improved levels of security; this enhances user
conﬁdence and increases public acceptance of biometric technologies. However,
the protection of multibiometric templates and the complete evaluation of
multimodal schemes in terms of user security and privacy is a challenging task,
Sasidhar et al. [188]. The applied fusion models and the embedded cryptographic
techniques aﬀect the performance accuracy which renders the systems vulnerable
to attacks and may lead to further security and privacy threats, Ross et al. [182].
Focusing on the basic approaches for the encryption of unimodal templates,
Rathgeb and Busch evaluated the incorporation of multimodal biometrics to
template protection and biometric cryptosystems techniques analyzing the
advantages and limitations of the proposed strategies [172].
Furthermore, when a user presents his biometric characteristics on a biometric
sensor, the scanned template might be distorted and misaligned. Depending
on the fusion strategy and the matching algorithm, the biometric system
42
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
should ensure that the generated templates are properly aligned. An alignment
correction algorithm can be applied before or after the feature extraction
procedure and prior to the selection of the cryptographic technique, Li and
Jain [122] and Theodorakis [204]. State-of-the-art presents studies focused
on the alignment issues in order to eﬀectively address the multimodal
template generation and representation, evaluated on diﬀerent fusion levels
and combinations of biometric data, Kelkboom et al. [112] and Sutcu et
al. [200] among others. Bolle et al. [30] described how cancelable biometrics
can be used as a protection mechanism for multibiometric references taking
into account the error ratio, Stoianov [199]. Nandakumar and Jain [148] and
Yang et al. [226] proposed novel protection schemes based on the technique of
biometric cryptosystems, using alignment methods to increase their applicability
in multimodal templates. Sutcu et al. in [201] emphasized the complexity of the
crypto-biometric algorithms, proposing solutions to decrease the computation
time in order to make multimodal solutions more practical for real-world
deployments. To conclude, experimental analyses that have been carried out
in diﬀerent combinations of biometric samples using several cryptographic
approaches report a signiﬁcant improvement of the reliability of multimodal
designs, Rathgeb and Busch [173]. However, the practicality of secure and
privacy-aware multibiometric schemes is still seen as an open research problem,
Wang et al. [221]. This is mainly due to the selection of the optimal fusion
rules and the overall performance setting in order to allow secure multimodal
recognition, Peng et al. [164] and Islam et al. [170].
Currently, research is focused on the possibilities to establish a cryptographic
technique that can oﬀer the security requirements of non-invertibility,
unlinkability, and cancelability, Natgunanathan et al. [150]. However, basic
protection approaches for multimodal templates have not managed to completely
address the properties of renewable biometric templates from multimodal
data, Nandakumar and Jain [149]. The design of a generalized encryption
framework applied on multibiometric data could be the ﬁrst step towards
this direction, Jagadeesan and Duraiswamy [97]. Several ideas of using a set
of multiple biometric features within protection schemes have been proposed.
Figure 3.4 summarizes the objectives of these eﬀorts, illustrating a framework for
multimodal recognition architectures, adapted from Rathgeb and Busch [172].
The major goal of the design is to eﬀectively address the performance and to
apply cryptographic mechanisms that will not be aﬀected by the embedded
biometric extraction algorithms, representation techniques and the selected
fusion approaches. Additionally, the scheme should allow the extraction of
multiple references to maintain unlinkability while oﬀering the advantages of
revocability and renewability. One of the limitations that the current design
presents is the selection of the fusion strategy. The existing research concludes

that fusion at the feature level, as presented in Section 2.5.1, is the most
suitable approach, Rathgeb et al. [175]. In this way, the system is capable of
incorporating n templates, addressing the necessity to follow complex fusion rules
and a normalization technique for the template generation, where k diﬀerent
binary representations of the biometric feature sets may be involved. After the
features extraction and representation the fusion process continues with an
applicable fusion algorithm and the selection of a basic or hybrid cryptographic
technique. The protection model can be based on template protection and
crypto-biometric schemes that are applied to the ﬁnal fused biometric feature
sets and generate the encrypted multimodal templates.
Our contribution. In our work [210], we presented a detailed study on the
protection mechanisms for multimodal recognition designs. We discussed the
eﬃciency of the proposed approaches and addressed the security and privacy
issues that may arise. We focused on the advantages and limitations of template
protection and crypto-biometric techniques, discussing their functionality and
practical implementation to multimodal systems. As [210] is not included in
Part II of this thesis, we proceed to summarize our ﬁndings. Fusion techniques
and rules are important factors that aﬀect the performance accuracy and
consequently the robustness of a multimodal system. Hence, their selection
should be thoroughly evaluated before applying the cryptographic mechanism.
The alignment of the multimodal templates is also a non-trivial task. The use
of algorithms to improve the alignment of the biometric templates requires
some additional primitives. However, the exposure of the parameters of these
primitives may compromise the biometric references. Any approach to handle
this issue should be carefully selected in order to avoid any information loss and
to preserve the protection of biometric data. Moreover, error-correction codes
