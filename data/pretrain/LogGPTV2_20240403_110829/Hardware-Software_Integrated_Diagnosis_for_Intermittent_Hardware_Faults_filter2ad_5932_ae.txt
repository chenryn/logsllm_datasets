### Diagnosis of Intermittent Faults in Processors

#### Introduction
Intermittent faults in processors can lead to erroneous data, and diagnosing these faults accurately is crucial for maintaining system reliability. Our technique uses a combination of non-faulty and faulty resources to speculate on the correctness of data before the failure point. However, this approach can sometimes misdiagnose non-faulty resources as faulty.

#### Main Source of Diagnosis Inaccuracies
One way to improve diagnosis accuracy is to record the output of every instruction, thereby eliminating the need for speculation. However, this method imposes significant performance overhead. Figure 7 illustrates the performance overhead of storing the destination register values for both 32-bit and 64-bit instructions across three SPEC 2006 programs. The overhead for storing the results of 32-bit and 64-bit instructions is 2X and 3X, respectively, compared to the overhead of storing only resource usage information. Therefore, we chose not to record the output of every instruction for diagnosis.

#### Enhancing Diagnosis Accuracy with SIED
SIED (Software-based Intermittent Error Detector) enhances diagnosis accuracy by using information from multiple occurrences of intermittent faults. Let \( RN \) denote the number of recurrences of the failure after which the diagnosis is performed. As shown in Figure 6, the diagnosis accuracy increases with \( RN \), but beyond \( RN = 4 \), the increase in accuracy is marginal.

#### Deconfiguration Overhead
The number of resources suggested by SIED as most likely to be faulty is denoted by \( N_{\text{deconf}} \). For the accuracies reported in Figure 6, \( N_{\text{deconf}} \) is chosen to be 5. The processor is deconfigured by disabling these \( N_{\text{deconf}} \) resources. Increasing \( N_{\text{deconf}} \) increases the likelihood of fixing the processor but also makes the diagnosis more coarse-grained, leading to more non-faulty resources being disabled. Figure 9a shows the diagnosis accuracy as \( N_{\text{deconf}} \) varies from 1 to 5, with an accuracy of 84% for \( N_{\text{deconf}} = 5 \). Figure 9b shows the average slowdown due to disabling 5 resources, ranging from 1% to 2.5%, with an average of 1.6%. This modest performance overhead justifies our choice of \( N_{\text{deconf}} = 5 \).

#### Performance, Power, and Area Overhead of SCRIBE
SCRIBE (Systematic Recording Infrastructure for Bug and Error Characterization) incurs a performance overhead of 14.7% on average across three processor configurations: narrow, medium, and wide. The wide configuration has a higher overhead (GeoMean = 23.21%) compared to the medium (GeoMean = 11.88%) and narrow (GeoMean = 11.53%) configurations. The power overhead of SCRIBE is 9.3% on average, including both active and idle power. Figure 11 breaks down the power consumption, showing that only 7.9% of the extra power is used by SCRIBE components. The rest is due to extra D-Cache accesses and additional cycles.

#### Trade-offs in Diagnosis Accuracy
There is a trade-off between diagnosis accuracy and the number of failure recurrences (\( RN \)). Early diagnosis can be less accurate, while postponing diagnosis to gather more information from subsequent failures can achieve higher accuracy. Figure 8 shows how changing \( RN \) affects diagnosis accuracy. We choose \( RN = 4 \) as a balance between accuracy and overhead.

#### Related Work
- **Bower et al.** [5] propose a hardware-only diagnosis mechanism by modifying the processor pipeline to track resource usage. Their scheme requires fine-grained checkers, limiting its applicability.
- **Li et al.** [9] use a hybrid hardware-software approach for permanent fault diagnosis. Their method relies on deterministic faults and may not work for non-deterministic intermittent faults.
- **IFRA** [11] records the footprint of every instruction during execution. Unlike IFRA, SCRIBE writes gathered information to memory during regular operation and does not require additional detectors.

#### Conclusion
We proposed a hardware/software integrated scheme for diagnosing intermittent faults in processors. Our scheme, consisting of SCRIBE and SIED, correctly diagnoses the faulty resource in 84% of cases on average, with a 12% performance overhead and 9% power consumption overhead. The performance loss after disabling the suggested resources is 1.6% on average.
