the response is either application/octet-stream or
contains the keyword “video”.
It follows that we miss
video downloads for content providers whose domain name
appears in neither the Host nor the Referer part of an
HTTP request. We ﬁnd that YouTube transfers video us-
ing both video and application/octet-stream.
The other three providers, however, only transfer video
using a video content-type (and sometimes employ
application/octet-stream for content such as CSS
and fonts).
• Porn Providers: Accurately attributing porn bandwidth re-
quires a more generic approach, since there are too many
providers (≈ 3,800 seen in our traces) to allow us to craft
individual signatures. Since a porn site can embed content
from other porn sites, when we see a transfer for which both
the Host domain and the Referer domain are labeled as
porn in our dataset, we give priority to the former. Speciﬁ-
cally, we use the rule: if Host has porn domain X, add the
corresponding bytes to X; else if Referer exists and has a
porn domain Y , add corresponding bytes to Y . Otherwise,
do not attribute the transfer to any domain.
6. CHANGES IN USER BEHAVIOR
The intrusive nature of Internet censorship will naturally lead
to some users altering their behavior in its aftermath. In this sec-
tion we quantify several perspectives regarding user demand for

blocked content before censorship, and their persistence and ap-
proaches in accessing blocked content after censorship comes into
place. While we cannot rule out other factors leading to some of
the changes we have observed, the broad scope of the censorship
events we consider makes it quite likely that our observations in-
deed reﬂect responses to censorship.
6.1 Changes in Trafﬁc
For video trafﬁc, we observe in Table 7(a) that on average
video trafﬁc comprised 50% of HTTP trafﬁc before the YouTube
block, consistent with global trends (videos comprised 57% of
user-generated trafﬁc in 2012 [8]). The overall (unencrypted) video
consumption rate drastically declines after the YouTube block, sub-
sequently comprising only 12% of total HTTP trafﬁc in 18Sep12,
and declining further to 5.5% in 02Aug13. The decline in video
trafﬁc coincides with a decrease of nearly 90% in the HTTP to
SSL8 ratio in 18Sep12, corresponding to the YouTube block day.
The ratio remained fairly consistent on this day as viewed hour-
to-hour (on average ≈ 3.25), indicating that SOHO users quickly
switched to SSL-based circumvention technologies. The trace for
this day does not reﬂect a clear learning phase, suggesting such had
already occurred by the time the capture began. The overall trend
for SSL trafﬁc remained consistent 11 months later in 02Aug13.
This steep increase in SSL trafﬁc post-YouTube-block highlights
that most users likely use encrypted tunnels to watch video content
after the block. As we note below, the SSL trafﬁc heavily corre-
lates with the use of proxy services, suggesting that it indeed arises
due to employment of circumvention measures. Our user study
substantiates this conjecture: 57% of the survey participants state
they used SSL-based VPN software (UltraSurf, OpenVPN, Hotspot
Shield) to access YouTube content.
If we look at direct video requests (either via user navigation,
or mediated by clicking on search results), per Table 8(b) we ﬁnd
that the vast majority of direct video requests prior to the block
correspond to YouTube (average 98%).
Immediately after block
(18Sep12), YouTube still receives the highest portion (though re-
duced by 27%) of direct requests, but the proportion sharply drops
11 months later in 02Aug13 to 46%, with users dispersing the rest
of the requests among alternate providers. The decrease in direct
YouTube video requests matches our survey results: 40% of re-
spondents mentioned that they do not bother to click on YouTube
links due to the blocking; 39% will access the link using a circum-
vention mechanism; while 17% access the video via an alternate
provider.
Table 7 shows that before the blocking, the average porn band-
width ranged from 8.4–11.5% for residential and SOHO users, re-
spectively. These numbers lie below global estimates that porn
comprises 30% of Internet trafﬁc [21]. That we ﬁnd more porn
bandwidth consumed at SOHOs than at homes likely occurs be-
cause of higher bandwidths available in SOHO networks. After
8We cannot conclusively say if the SSL trafﬁc corresponds to VPNs
or HTTPS.
