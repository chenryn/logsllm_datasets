### Response Content-Type and Video Downloads

The response content type is either `application/octet-stream` or contains the keyword "video." Consequently, we may miss video downloads for content providers whose domain names do not appear in either the `Host` or `Referer` parts of an HTTP request. Our findings indicate that YouTube transfers video using both `video` and `application/octet-stream` content types. In contrast, the other three providers exclusively use the `video` content type for video transfers, occasionally employing `application/octet-stream` for non-video content such as CSS and fonts.

### Pornographic Content Attribution

Accurately attributing bandwidth to pornographic content requires a more generic approach due to the large number of providers (approximately 3,800 observed in our traces). Given that a porn site can embed content from other porn sites, we prioritize the `Host` domain over the `Referer` domain. Specifically, if the `Host` domain is labeled as porn, we attribute the corresponding bytes to that domain. If the `Host` domain is not labeled as porn but the `Referer` domain is, we attribute the bytes to the `Referer` domain. If neither domain is labeled as porn, the transfer is not attributed to any domain.

### Changes in User Behavior

The intrusive nature of internet censorship naturally leads some users to alter their behavior. In this section, we quantify several perspectives on user demand for blocked content before and after censorship, including their persistence and methods for accessing blocked content. While other factors may contribute to the observed changes, the broad scope of the censorship events makes it likely that our observations reflect responses to censorship.

#### Changes in Traffic

For video traffic, Table 7(a) shows that, on average, video traffic comprised 50% of HTTP traffic before the YouTube block, consistent with global trends (57% of user-generated traffic in 2012 [8]). After the YouTube block, unencrypted video consumption declined sharply, comprising only 12% of total HTTP traffic on 18Sep12 and further declining to 5.5% by 02Aug13. This decline coincided with a nearly 90% decrease in the HTTP to SSL ratio on 18Sep12, indicating a rapid switch to SSL-based circumvention technologies. The trace for this day did not show a clear learning phase, suggesting that SOHO users had already adopted these technologies. The trend for SSL traffic remained consistent 11 months later on 02Aug13, highlighting that most users likely used encrypted tunnels to watch video content post-block. The SSL traffic heavily correlates with the use of proxy services, supporting the idea that it arises from circumvention measures. Our user study confirms this: 57% of survey participants reported using SSL-based VPN software (UltraSurf, OpenVPN, Hotspot Shield) to access YouTube content.

Table 8(b) shows that the vast majority of direct video requests before the block were for YouTube (average 98%). Immediately after the block (18Sep12), YouTube still received the highest portion of direct requests, though reduced by 27%. By 02Aug13, the proportion of direct YouTube requests dropped to 46%, with users dispersing the remaining requests among alternate providers. This aligns with our survey results: 40% of respondents stated they no longer click on YouTube links due to the blocking, 39% use circumvention mechanisms, and 17% access videos via alternate providers.

Table 7 indicates that before the blocking, the average porn bandwidth ranged from 8.4% to 11.5% for residential and SOHO users, respectively. These numbers are below global estimates that porn comprises 30% of internet traffic [21]. The higher porn bandwidth at SOHOs compared to homes is likely due to the higher available bandwidth in SOHO networks.

### DNS Resolver Usage

Before the YouTube block, the primary DNS resolver for SOHO traffic was the local ISP, with Google, Level3, and others handling a small percentage of queries. After the block, the usage of local ISPs decreased, while the usage of Google, Level3, and other resolvers increased, reflecting a shift towards alternative DNS services.
