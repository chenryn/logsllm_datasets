User: Is it possible to retrieve an entity from google appengine using their numerical IDs and if so how?
I tried using:
key = Key.from_path("ModelName", numericalId)
m = ModelName.get(key)
but the key generated wasnt correct.
Assistant: Turns out I needed to do 
key = Key.from_path( Application_ModelName, numeric_id )
wasn't clear till i looked at the dict() of an entity
