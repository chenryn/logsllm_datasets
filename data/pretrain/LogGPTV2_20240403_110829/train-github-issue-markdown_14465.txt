In version r69, the `Raycaster` object is incorrectly detecting an intersection with a parallel line that has been shifted 3 units along the x-axis (and thus does not overlap).

**Browser:**  
Chromium Version 38.0.2121.0 (288663)  

**Operating System:**  
Windows 7  

**Graphics Card:**  
AMD Radeon HD 7570M  

**Reproduction Steps:**  
- [JSFiddle Example](#) (Please provide the actual JSFiddle link)

**Actual Outcome:**  
The `intersectObject` method returns `true` for the parallel, non-overlapping line.

**Expected Outcome:**  
The `intersectObject` method should return `false` for the parallel, non-overlapping line.
