pipelined is a subset of persistent and same packet is a subset of pipelined. Thus, the
bars are not stacked, but overlay each other. Note the different scale on the y-axis.
Again, we ﬁnd the 30 % from Figure 3 for the combination of the persistent method
with the Conns metric for JUN10.
Looking at persistent requests (solid bars in Figure 4), we do not observe signiﬁcant
changes over time/traces. The fraction of connections with persistent requests increases
slightly from 25 % to 30 %. While the fraction of persistent requests is fairly constant
around 60 %, the volume transferred in persistent requests is around 25 % with the ex-
ception of JUN10 where it is over 30 %.
Summary. When only considering the ﬁrst request in a HTTP connection, one would
miss around two thirds of the request, and one third of the volume transferred.
3.2 Pipelined Requests
Pipelined requests (shaded bars in Figures 4 and 5) exhibit considerably lower values
for all metrics. While the fraction of connections with pipelined requests increases from
4 % to 6 % from SEP08 to JUN10, the contribution in terms of volume of pipelined
requests decreases from 4 % to below 2 %.
If a HTTP trafﬁc analysis does look at multiple request in HTTP connections, but
only includes those that are at the beginning of a packet, it would miss around 4 % of
the requests and up to 4 % of the volume. Similarly, if the analysis assumes only one
request per packet and just greps for the last string that matches a certain header ﬁeld
in the packet, 4 % of the requests would be affected.

3.3 Impact of Browser
Common wisdom4 suggests that pipelining is disabled by default in the most popu-
lar browsers. Our traces on the other hand show a non-negligible amount of pipelined
requests. We therefore drill down into the data and analyze it across browser fami-
lies, operating systems, and content-types. In addition we select a number of—in our
dataset—popular and high-volume web services for comparison.
We expect that browsers have a signiﬁcant impact on the number of persistent and
pipelined requests. While the server needs to support HTTP/1.1 for persistent and
pipelined request, the browser ultimately has to issue the request. Callahan et al. [2]
observed a drastic change in the number of requests per connection and attributes the
change to a different default browser version in the environment they monitor.
In Figure 6, we show per browser results for the persistent and pipelined request
marking methods for JUN10, as in Figure 4. We observe that the variance among the dif-
ferent browser categories is limited. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (MSIE), has around
10 % more persistent bytes than Firefox. Together, they account for 70 % of the vol-
ume and 80 % of the requests. Opera does stand out with an unusually high fraction of
pipelined requests, which is expected as it is the only browser that has HTTP pipelining
enabled by default. Yet, it comprises only about 2.5 % of the total requests and volume.
We do ﬁnd similar results for the per OS analysis. Linux and MacOS X have lower
fractions of persistent bytes than Windows, although the fraction of requests is similar.
3.4 Impact of Web Service
We now select the 30 most requested and/or highest volume second level domains from
our dataset and calculate our metrics as for the browser categories. We then group to-
gether domains from (i) the same web service (e. g., facebook.com and fbcdn.com)
and (ii) similar types of pages when the results are similar: “OSN” consists of three
locally popular online social networks (Jappy, Mein/StudiVZ, and Schueller.cc) with
similar results and “Adult” consists of three video portals offering adult content. The
fraction of persistent and pipelined requests and bytes of the resulting 18 web services
are shown in Figure 7 for JUN10.
The plot shows more variations across web services compared to across browsers
versions in Figure 6. Web services have a stronger inﬂuence on persistence and pipelin-
ing. The fraction of persistent requests ranges from 11 % (Uploaded.to) up to 88 %
(WindowsUpdate), and the fraction of bytes in persistent requests even ranges from
<1 % (MegaVideo and MegaUpload) to 95 % (again WindowsUpdate). In terms of
pipelined requests we see maxima at 33 % for Microsoft and 11 % for RapidShare for
requests and volume, respectively. These fractions are signiﬁcantly higher than those
we observe for Opera, which achieved the highest fraction so far. We do not observe
a strong relation between the type of web service and persistence/pipelining. Consider
for example the One-Click Hosters MegaUpload, RapidShare, and Uploaded.to. While
MegaUpload has more than 70 % of persistent requests, the other two have barely more
the 10 %. Moreover, all request that are persistent are also pipelined for RapidShare,
