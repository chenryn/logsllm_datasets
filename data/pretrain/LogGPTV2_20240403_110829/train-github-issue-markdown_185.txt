**What is the current behavior?**  
Webpack crashes when using `MinChunkSizePlugin` with the following error:
    pair[2].integrate(pair[3], "min-size");
                                            ^
    TypeError: pair[2].integrate is not a function

Using the following options: `new
webpack.optimize.MinChunkSizePlugin({minChunkSize: 40000}),`
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
As this seems to have been fixed in master (`915c150`), I'm not going to spend
time on creating a repro. Still think it might be good to create this issue
for other people running into this.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
No crash.
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**
