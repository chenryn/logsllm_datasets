User: How to use the thread pool in the Java application to improve the concurrent processing capability of the system?
Assistant: Java provides the java.util.concurrent package to support concurrent programming, which includes a thread pool framework. Using the thread pool can reduce the overhead of thread creation and destruction, and can control the number of concurrent threads to prevent excessive resource occupation. You can use the thread pool through the following steps: 1. Create a thread pool object. You can use the static factory method of the Executors class to create different types of thread pools, such as newFixedThreadPool, newSingleThreadExecutor, and newCachedThreadPool. 2. Submit the task to be executed to the thread pool, and you can use the submit or execute method provided by the thread pool to submit the task. 3. The thread pool will automatically allocate idle threads to execute tasks. After the execution is completed, the threads will return to the thread pool and wait for the allocation of the next task. 4. At the end of the program, the shutdown method needs to be called to close the thread pool and release the thread pool object and all its resources. For example, the following is a code sample that uses the thread pool to complete the sum of Fibonacci numbers: ``` import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.Future; public class FibonacciThreadPool { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2); Future<Integer> future1 = executor.submit(new Fibonacci(10)); Future<Integer> future2 = executor .submit(new Fibonacci(20)); System.out.println(future1.get() + future2.get()); executor.shutdown(); } static class Fibonacci implements Callable<Integer> { private int n; public Fibonacci(int n) { this.n = n; } public Integer call() throws Exception { if (n <= 0) { return 0; } else if (n == 1) { return 1; } else { return call (n - 1) + call(n - 2); } } } } ``` In this example, a fixed thread pool with a size of 2 is created, and two threads are used to calculate different Fibonacci numbers and, and output the result. The thread pool automatically allocates threads to perform tasks in the submit method. Finally, call the shutdown method to close the thread pool.
