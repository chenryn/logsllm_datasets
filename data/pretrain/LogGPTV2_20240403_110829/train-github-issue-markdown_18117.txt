Hi,  
When a modal is shown on a smaller device resolution (iPhone) and it contains
more content in the body than can fit on screen, the footer of the modal is
cut off from view and unreachable.
iPhone dimensions:

Desktop dimensions:

I would assume that the height of the modal body is suppose to adjust so that
the header and footer are always shown?
Thanks.
