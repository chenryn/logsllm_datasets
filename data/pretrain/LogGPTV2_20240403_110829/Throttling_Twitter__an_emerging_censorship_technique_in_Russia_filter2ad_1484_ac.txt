### 6.7 Longitudinal Analysis

Our longitudinal measurements reveal that the throttling is sporadic and inconsistent over time. For example, on March 19, we observed that throttling was lifted on our OBIT vantage point for approximately two days. This observation aligns with an article reporting OBIT’s service outages, which indicated that OBIT had to exclude TSPU devices from the routing path to restore operation [18].

Additionally, we find that the throttling on some vantage points is stochastic, influenced by potential routing changes and load balancing. Figure 7 illustrates these findings. Notably, OBIT and Tele2 lifted the throttling much earlier than the official announcement on May 17, after which all other landline networks also ceased to throttle Twitter.

### 7 Circumvention Strategies

Based on insights obtained through reverse engineering the throttler, we have identified and verified several circumvention strategies:

1. **Prepending Client Hello Records**: Adding other TLS records, such as Change Cipher Specs, to the Client Hello record can bypass the throttling (refer to § 6.2).
2. **Splitting Sensitive Client Hellos**: Splitting sensitive Client Hellos into multiple TCP packets, either by decreasing the Window Size [19, 58] or by inflating the packet with padding extensions [25] (refer to § 6.2).
3. **Idle Connections and Fake Packets**: Leveraging the fact that the throttler discards inactive and unrecognized sessions, by keeping connections idle for around ten minutes or prepending a fake, random packet with a lower TTL of more than 100 bytes (refer to § 6.2, 6.6).
4. **Encrypted Proxies and VPNs**: As expected, encrypted proxies or VPNs can also bypass the throttling.

While these strategies are effective, they are likely to be known and adopted only by power users. Therefore, we recommend that browsers and websites implement measures to encrypt the SNI, such as using TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), to make it more challenging for censors to throttle based on SNI.

### 8 Discussion and Conclusion

The throttling of Twitter in Russia marks the first acknowledged use of targeted throttling as a means to pressure social media sites. Twitter's compliance [45] demonstrates the success of this censorship technique. At the time of this paper's submission, Russia had already moved to pressure Google to remove anti-government content from YouTube [40], using the threat of throttling.

This emerging censorship technique sets a dangerous precedent for countries seeking to discourage citizens from accessing prohibited resources. The proliferation of "dual-use" technologies like DPI devices has equipped censors with a more sophisticated toolkit, enabling them to implement advanced techniques beyond outright blocking. From the censor's perspective, the noisy nature of throttling makes it both effective and economical, while being challenging for users to attribute and difficult for researchers to measure. Current censorship detection platforms [33, 35, 50] that focus on blocking are not yet equipped to monitor throttling. We hope that our findings serve as a wake-up call to censorship researchers and encourage future work in detecting and circumventing this emergent censorship technique.

### A.1 Timeline of the Event

- **March 10, 2021**: Russia began throttling access to Twitter-related services. Roskomnadzor issued an official explanation, stating that the government had “taken measures to protect Russian citizens from the influence of unlawful content,” referring to Twitter’s non-compliance with Russian content takedown requests [42]. The slowdown was implemented on 100% of mobile services and 50% of landline services. Internet user ValdikSS disclosed that the relaxed regular expression matching rule *t.co* was causing collateral damage to non-Twitter sites [34].
- **March 11, 2021**: The *t.co* matching rule was patched to match only t.co. Roskomnadzor issued a press release confirming that Twitter was being throttled as expected [43]. We began collaborating with local activists and started running measurements.
- **March 30, 2021**: Russian police detained four members of the Vesna movement who were protesting the throttling of Twitter by carrying flags with the Roskomnadzor logo [31].
- **April 2, 2021**: The regex matching rule *twitter.com was restricted to twitter.com. Roskomnadzor fined Twitter 8.9 million rubles for failing to respond to content takedown requests.
- **April 5, 2021**: Following a talk with Twitter on April 1st, Roskomnadzor acknowledged that Twitter had increased the speed of removing prohibited materials but extended the throttling to May 15th [44].
- **April 28, 2021**: Roskomnadzor stated that Twitter was complying with demands to remove banned content and agreed to establish a direct line of communication between the watchdog and Twitter’s moderation service [47].
- **May 14, 2021**: Twitter informed Roskomnadzor that it had fulfilled the requirements to remove prohibited content and requested the lifting of throttling [45].
- **May 17, 2021**: Our measurements indicate that the throttling was lifted for landlines at around 16:40 Moscow time. Roskomnadzor issued an official statement appreciating Twitter’s efforts and removed throttling for landlines while continuing to throttle mobile operators [46].
- **May 24, 2021**: Roskomnadzor pressured Google to remove anti-government content from YouTube within 24 hours, using the same threat of throttling [40].

By providing a clear and detailed timeline, we aim to highlight the evolving nature of this censorship technique and its broader implications.
