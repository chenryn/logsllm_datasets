6.7 Longitudinal Analysis
The throttling is sporadic and inconsistent over time: From our
longitudinal measurements, we observe that the throttling occurs
sporadically on some vantage points, suggesting that the system is
still under active testing and development. For instance, on March
19, we notice that throttling was lifted on our OBIT vantage point
for about two days. This correlates with an article about OBIT’s
service outages which also reported that OBIT had to exclude the
TSPU devices from the routing path to restore operation [18].
We also find that on some vantage points the throttling is sto-
chastic in nature, depending on possible routing changes and load
balancing. Figure 7 illustrates our findings. Note that OBIT and
Tele2 lifted the throttling much earlier before the official announce-
ment on May 17, after which all other landline networks also ceased
to throttle Twitter.
7 CIRCUMVENTION
We find and verify several circumvention strategies that can bypass
the throttling, based on the insights we obtain by reverse engineer-
ing the throttler. Prepending Client Hello records with other TLS
records, such as Change Cipher Specs, which is semantically valid,
allows us to bypass the throttling (refer to § 6.2). Another strategy
is splitting sensitive Client Hellos into multiple TCP packets, either
by decreasing Window Size [19, 58] or by inflating the packet with
padding extension [25] (refer to § 6.2). Moreover, we can lever-
age the fact that the throttler discards inactive and unrecognized
sessions, by keeping connections idle for around ten minutes or
prepending a fake, random packet with lower TTL of size more
than 100 bytes (refer to § 6.2, 6.6). Finally, encrypted proxies or
VPNs can bypass the throttling, as expected.
While these strategies are effective, only power users are likely
aware and capable of adopting them. Therefore, we recommend
browsers and websites implement efforts to encrypt the SNI such as
using TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), to make it more difficult
for censors to throttle based on SNI.
8 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The throttling of Twitter in Russia marks the first acknowledged
use of targeted throttling as a means to put pressure on social media
sites. Twitter’s compliance [45] proves the success of throttling as a
censorship technique. At the time of submission of this paper, Russia
already moved to pressuring Google to remove anti-government
content from YouTube [40], using the threat of throttling.
The emerging censorship technique of throttling sets a danger-
ous precedent for all countries that seek to discourage citizens
from accessing prohibited resources. The proliferation of “dual-use”
technologies such as DPI devices has equipped censors around the
world with a more complex toolkit to implement more advanced
techniques than outright blocking. From the censor’s perspective,
the noisy nature of throttling makes it effective and economical to
implement, but challenging for users to attribute and difficult for re-
searchers to measure, especially since current censorship detection
platforms [33, 35, 50] that focus on blocking are not yet equipped
to monitor throttling. We hope that our findings serve as a wake-
up call to censorship researchers and encourage future work in
detecting and circumventing this emergent censorship technique.

A APPENDIX
A.1 Timeline of the event
• Starting from March 10, 2021, Russia has started throttling
access to Twitter-related services. At 10:30 AM local time,
Roskomnadzor issued an official explanation for the throt-
tling, saying that the government had “taken measures to
protect Russian citizens from the influence of unlawful con-
tent”, alluding to Twitter’s non-compliance with Russian
content takedown requests [42]. According to the statement,
the slowdown was be implemented on 100% of mobile ser-
vices and 50% of landline services. On the same day, internet
user ValdikSS disclosed that the relaxed regular expression
matching rule *t.co* was being used, which caused consid-
erable collateral damage [34] to non-Twitter sites such as
microsoft.co and reddit.com.
• On March 11, more than 24 hours after the onset of the event,
the *t.co* matching rule was apparently patched and only
an exact match of t.co can trigger throttling. Shortly after
the patch, Roskomnadzor issued a press release that stated
“Twitter is throttled as expected” [43]. Later that day, we
began collaboration with local activists, obtained access to
local vantage points and started running measurements to
study the event.
• On March 30, Russian police detained four members of the
Vesna movement who were carrying flags with the Roskom-
nadzor logo to protest the throttling of Twitter [31].
• On April 2, the regex matching rule *twitter.com was re-
stricted to twitter.com, possibly in response to our initial
report. On the same day, a statement from Roskomnadzor
disclosed that Twitter was fined 8.9 million rubles for failure
to respond to content takedown requests.
• On April 5, following a talk with Twitter that took place on
April 1st, Roskomnadzor issued another statement acknowl-
edging that Twitter has “increased the speed of removing
prohibited materials” [44]. However, since the content re-
moval speed was still not aligned with Russia’s law, the
throttling was extended to May 15th.
• On April 28, Roskomnadzor said Twitter was “complying
with demand to remove banned content” and that it and
Twitter agreed to establish a direct line of communication be-
tween the watchdog and Twitter’s moderation service [47].
• On May 14, Twitter informed Roskomnadzor that it had
fulfilled the requirements to remove content prohibited in
Russia and requested the throttling to be lifted [45].
• Our continual measurement indicates that the throttling was
lifted for landlines on May 17 around 16:40 Moscow time. On
17:00, Roskomnadzor issued an official statement in which
it “appreciates the efforts of Twitter to comply with the
requirements of Russian legislation” and therefore removed
throttling of Twitter on landlines while continued throttling
Twitter on mobile operators [46].

• On May 24, Roskomnadzor pressured Google to remove anti-
government content from YouTube [40] within 24 hours,
using the same threat of throttling Google’s traffic inside the
country.
