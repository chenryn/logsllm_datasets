User: I would like to know if it's possible to run Python application subprocess in such way that there wouldn't be duplicate process in task manager?
Assistant: Are you sure this "subprocess" needs to actually be a process?  Maybe you could do the work inside of a thread instead of forking a new process.  I'm not sure if that would accomplish your goals though, since you're not specific about what you need multiple processes for.
