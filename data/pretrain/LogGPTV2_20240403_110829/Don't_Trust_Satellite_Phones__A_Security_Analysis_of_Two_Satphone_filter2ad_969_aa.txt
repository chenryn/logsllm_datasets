Abstract—There is a rich body of work related to the
security aspects of cellular mobile phones, in particular with
respect to the GSM and UMTS systems. To the best of our
knowledge, however, there has been no investigation of the
security of satellite phones (abbr. satphones). Even though a
niche market compared to the G2 and G3 mobile systems, there
are several 100,000 satphone subscribers worldwide. Given the
sensitive nature of some of their application domains (e.g.,
natural disaster areas or military campaigns), security plays a
particularly important role for satphones.
In this paper, we analyze the encryption systems used in
the two existing (and competing) satphone standards, GMR-1
and GMR-2. The ﬁrst main contribution is that we were able
to completely reverse engineer the encryption algorithms em-
ployed. Both ciphers had not been publicly known previously.
We describe the details of the recovery of the two algorithms
from freely available DSP-ﬁrmware updates for satphones,
which included the development of a custom disassembler
and tools to analyze the code, and extending prior work on
binary analysis to efﬁciently identify cryptographic code. We
note that these steps had to be repeated for both systems,
because the available binaries were from two entirely different
DSP processors. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we found that
the GMR-1 cipher can be considered a proprietary variant of
the GSM A5/2 algorithm, whereas the GMR-2 cipher is an
entirely new design. The second main contribution lies in the
cryptanalysis of the two proprietary stream ciphers. We were
able to adopt known A5/2 ciphertext-only attacks to the GMR-
1 algorithm with an average case complexity of 232 steps. With
respect to the GMR-2 cipher, we developed a new attack which
is powerful in a known-plaintext setting. In this situation, the
encryption key for one session, i.e., one phone call, can be
recovered with approximately 50–65 bytes of key stream and
a moderate computational complexity. A major ﬁnding of our
work is that the stream ciphers of the two existing satellite
phone systems are considerably weaker than what is state-of-
the-art in symmetric cryptography.

I. INTRODUCTION
Mobile communication systems have revolutionized the
way we interact with each other. Instead of depending on
landlines, we can talk to other people wherever we are and
also send data from (almost) arbitrary locations. Especially
the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) has
attracted quite a lot of attention and with more than four
billion subscribers in 2011, it is the most widely deployed
standard for cellular networks. Many other cellular network
standards like Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS), CDMA2000 (also known as IMT Multi-Carrier
(IMT-MC)), or 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) exist and
are continuously enhanced to meet the growing customer
demands.
Cellular mobile networks require a so called cell site
to create a cell within the network. The cell site provides
all the necessary equipment for transmitting and receiving
radio signals from mobile handsets and the radio network.
For example, the cell site contains one or more sets of
transmitter/receivers, the necessary antennas, digital signal
processors to perform all computations, a GPS receiver for
timing, and other control electronics. Within GSM, the cell
site is called Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and other
cellular networks also require this kind of equipment. The
cells within a network have only a limited operating distance
and thus a certain proximity to a cell site is necessary to
establish a connection to the mobile network.
In practice, however, it is not always possible to be close
to a cell site and there are many use cases in which no cover-
age is provided. Workers on an oil rig or on board of a ship,
researchers on a ﬁeld trip in a desert or near the poles, people
living in remote areas or areas that are affected by a natural
disaster, or certain military and governmental systems are a
few of many uses cases where terrestrial cellular networks
are not available. To overcome this limitation, satellite
telecommunication systems were introduced that provide
telephony and data services based on telecommunications
satellites. In such systems, the mobile handset (typically
called satellite phone, abbr. satphone) communicates directly
with satellites in orbit and thus coverage can be provided
without the need of an infrastructure on the Earth’s surface.
At this point, there are two satphone standards that were
both developed in the past few years:
• Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) Mobile Radio Inter-
face (better known as GMR-1) is a family of ETSI
standards that were derived from the terrestrial cellular
standard GSM. In fact,
the speciﬁcations of GMR
are an extension of the GSM standard, where certain
aspects of the speciﬁcation are adjusted for satphone
settings. This protocol family is supported by several
providers and the de-facto standard in this area and has
undergone several revisions to support a broader range
of services.

• The GMR-2 family is also an ETSI standard that
is even closer to GSM. It deviates from the GMR-
1 speciﬁcations in numerous ways, most notably the
network architecture is different.
The speciﬁcations of GMR-1 and GMR-2 are available
since both are ETSI standards. However, the speciﬁcations
do not provide any information about implementation details
of security aspects. More precisely, it is for example not
publicly known which encryption algorithm is actually used
to secure the communication channel between a satphone
and a satellite. This implies that the security aspects of
both standards are poorly documented and proprietary. This
is problematic due to the fact that an attacker can easily
eavesdrop on the communication channel since the radio
signal can be captured with antennas even at some distance
to the satphone. At
is thus unclear what
effort would be needed by an attacker to actually intercept
telephony and data services for common satphone systems.
In this paper, we address this problem and perform a
security analysis of the two satphone standards GMR-1 and
GMR-2. More speciﬁcally, we are interested in the stream
ciphers A5-GMR-1 and A5-GMR-2 implemented on the sat-
phones since they are responsible for providing conﬁdential
communication channels. To assess the attack surface, we
analyzed two popular satellite phones that represent typical
handsets:
this point,
it
1) The Thuraya SO-2510 phone implements the GMR-1
standard. It was released in November 2006 and one
of the most popular handsets sold by Thuraya.
2) The Inmarsat IsatPhone Pro implements the GMR-
2 standard1 and supports functions such as voice
telephony and text/email messaging. It was introduced
in June 2010 by Inmarsat.
In principle, satphones implement a hardware architec-
ture similar to typical mobile phones used in terrestrial
networks. However, since satphones operate according to
different standards, we had to reverse-engineer the phones
in detail to understand the algorithms implemented in them.
More speciﬁcally, we developed our own set of tools to
disassemble the machine code and to perform typical binary
analysis tasks such as control and data ﬂow analysis. This is
challenging since satphones do not use the Intel x86 instruc-
tion set architecture but typically a combination of an ARM-
based CPU and a digital signal processor (DSP). Recently,
several techniques were introduced to detect cryptographic
code within a binary in a generic way [1]–[3]. While such
techniques can also be leveraged for our analysis, it turned
out that these methods have certain limitations in practice
since signal processing code and speech encoding algorithms
exhibit patterns similar to crypto code. To overcome this
problem, we developed our own set of heuristics and pro-
gram analysis techniques to isolate the cryptographic algo-
rithms of the GMR-1 and GMR-2 standards implemented

in the phones. We are the ﬁrst to publish these algorithms,
thus disclosing which crypto algorithms are actually used to
secure the communication channel in satphone systems.
Based on our analysis results, we also performed crypt-
analysis of both algorithms. We introduce different variants
of known and novel attacks and successfully break both
algorithms. More speciﬁcally, GMR-1 uses a stream-cipher
that
is a modiﬁed version of the A5/2 cipher used in
GSM, for which we develop both a known-keystream and
a ciphertext-only attack. Furthermore, we propose an attack
against a speciﬁc GMR-1 channel which has some properties
that we can take advantage of. In contrast, GMR-2 uses a
proprietary cipher, for which we present a known-plaintext
attack whose parameters can be tuned with a time/keystream
trade-off. Effectively, we thus demonstrate that current sat-
phone systems are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks and
the results of this paper can be used to build an interceptor
for satellite telecommunication systems.
In summary, we make the following contributions:
• We are the ﬁrst to perform an empirical security analy-
sis of the satellite phone standards GMR-1 and GMR-
2, focusing on the encryption algorithms implemented
in the handsets. This includes reverse-engineering of
ﬁrmware images to understand the inner working of
the phones, developing our own disassembler and tools
to analyze the code, and extending prior work on binary
analysis to efﬁciently identify cryptographic code.
• We perform a formal cryptanalysis of the extracted
algorithms and extend a known attack on GSM for
GMR-1 and introduce an entirely new attack for GMR-
2. Thus we are able to break the encryption in both
standards. The attacks can be tuned by a time/ciphertext
trade-off for GMR-1 and a time/keystream trade-off for
GMR-2. We thus demonstrate that the current satphone
standards are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
We now introduce the necessary background information
to understand the basics of satellite telephone systems, their
security mechanisms, and the architecture of the mobile
handsets. More information about these topics can be found
in the literature [4]–[8]. Furthermore, we discuss related
work in this area.
A. Satellite Telecommunication Systems
A geostationary orbit telephone network consists of a
set of satellites and terrestrial gateway/control stations, as
depicted in Figure 1. Gateway stations provide the con-
nectivity to any tethered networks, e.g., telephone calls to
a landline are forwarded to the public switched telephone
network (PSTN). Satellite operators also run additional con-
trol facilities for maintenance and conﬁguration purposes.
Both types of transmissions employ conventional wavelength
(C-Band) signals. Each satellite serves a speciﬁc region,

with each region being further subdivided by several spot
beams. This mainly allows to transfer multiple signals from
different regions on equal frequencies. The system uses long
wavelength transmission (L-Band) for spotbeams.

In this paper, we focus on the communication channel
between end user devices and satellites. This is the only
part of the system that is (partially) publicly documented
by the GMR speciﬁcation [6], [9]. The ofﬁcial speciﬁcation
discusses topics relevant to signaling, encoding, and similar
aspects of the system. However, no implementation details
about
the actual cryptographic algorithms that are used
between satphones and satellites are disclosed.
The frequency band in GMR systems is divided into
different channels and just like in GSM the Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA) time slot architecture is employed
which divides each channel into TDMA frames with mul-
tiple time slots. Several logical channels (called channels
from now on) are mapped on these time slots. There are
different types of channels, but all are either trafﬁc channels
(TCH) for voice- or fax-data, or control channels (CCH).
Data which is sent over any channel is encoded to add
redundancy and protect against transmission failures. For
some channels, the encoded data is subsequently encrypted.
The encoded (and encrypted) data is ﬁnally modulated
accordingly before it is transmitted via the phone’s antenna.
The encoding scheme differs from channel to channel and
is dependent on the respective reliability requirements as
deﬁned in the various standards.
Figure 2 provides a highly abstract sketch of the authen-
tication and encryption protocol used by GMR-1 and GMR-
2. In this protocol, the satellite initiates authentication by
sending a request to the phone shortly after the phone has
established a connection. This request contains a random
number RAND, which is sent to the phone’s SIM card. On
the SIM card, the A3 and A8 algorithm are implemented
that generate a session key Kc and an authentication token
SRES. Both algorithms are not disclosed in the speciﬁcation
and use the SIM card speciﬁc key Ki as second input. After
authentication, the encryption is switched on and all subse-
quent communication on the relevant channels is encrypted
by a stream cipher denoted as A5-GMR, which is also not
publicly documented. Due to the limited computing power
of the SIM card and the limited bandwidth of the physical
connection, the stream cipher is typically implemented on
the satphone2. The cipher is used to generate a keystream
speciﬁc for blocks of data, which we will denote as frames.
In this protocol, the keystream is dependent on the frame’s
number N and Kc, which was derived from RAND. Due to
this architecture, only the stream cipher is responsible for
conﬁdentiality which is why we focus on this algorithm in
the rest of this paper.
B. Satellite Telephone Architecture
We now brieﬂy elaborate on the general architectural
structure of satellite phones and the hardware behind such
devices. In a later section, we provide more details on the
speciﬁc phones we studied during our analysis, including a
