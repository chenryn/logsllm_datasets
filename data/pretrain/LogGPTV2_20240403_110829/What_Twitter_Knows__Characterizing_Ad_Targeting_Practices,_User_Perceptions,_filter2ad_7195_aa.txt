**Abstract:**
Targeted advertising has garnered significant attention from privacy researchers, yet many empirical questions remain unanswered. While a few targeting mechanisms used by major platforms are well understood, many others are not. Studies on user perceptions of ad targeting often rely on hypothetical scenarios, and the effectiveness of existing transparency mechanisms, such as data-access rights and ad explanations, is unclear. This paper uses the Twitter data of 231 participants to provide a deeper understanding of the current targeted advertising ecosystem. We find that many understudied targeting mechanisms, including advertiser-uploaded lists of specific users, lookalike audiences, and retargeting campaigns, are widely used on Twitter. Participants found these practices to be among the most privacy-invasive. Additionally, participants preferred ad explanations designed for this study over Twitter’s current explanations, finding them more useful and comprehensible. Our findings highlight the benefits of data access, characterize understudied facets of targeted advertising, and suggest directions for improving transparency.

**1. Introduction**
Social media companies derive a significant portion of their revenue from highly targeted advertising, which leverages both directly and indirectly collected user data. Prior research indicates that while users may find well-targeted ads useful, they also perceive them as "creepy" and potentially embarrassing. There are also concerns about discrimination and the accuracy of user categorizations. Moreover, users have a limited understanding of the scope and mechanics of targeted advertising.

Many studies have focused on demographic or interest-based targeting, but platforms like Twitter and Google offer numerous, more precise targeting mechanisms. These include data provided by users (e.g., followed accounts), inferred by the platform (e.g., potential future purchases), and provided by advertisers (e.g., PII-indexed lists). Due to the lack of detailed information in users' advertising profiles, prior work often relies on hypothetical scenarios.

We leverage data subjects' right of access to their data, strengthened by laws like GDPR and CCPA, to gain a comprehensive and ecologically valid view of targeted advertising. Twitter provides users with granular data about their account, including all ads displayed in the last 90 days, associated targeting criteria, interests, and advertisers.

In this study, we explore the discrete targeting mechanisms offered on Twitter, how they are used, and users' perceptions of these practices and existing transparency mechanisms. A total of 231 Twitter users downloaded and shared their advertising-related data, and completed an online survey incorporating this data. We analyzed Twitter's targeting ecosystem, measured participants' reactions to different types of ad targeting, and conducted a survey-based experiment on potential ad explanations.

**2.1 Targeted Advertising Techniques**
Web tracking dates back to 1996, and the online ad ecosystem has become increasingly sophisticated. Companies track users' browsing activity to create profiles for targeted advertising. Many studies have examined tools to block tracking and targeted ads, but tracking companies can still observe some user activities. Social media platforms collect rich data, including sensitive categories, and use it to develop extensive user profiles. Recent techniques, such as custom audience targeting and lookalike-audience targeting, combine online and offline data, raising new privacy concerns.

**2.2 Transparency Mechanisms**
Ad and analytics companies offer transparency tools, such as ad preference managers and ad explanations. However, there is a disparity between the information available to advertisers and what is visible to users. Researchers have developed reverse-engineering tools to extract information about targeting mechanisms, but these tools face scalability and interface change challenges.

**2.3 Perceptions of Targeting & Transparency**
Users do not fully understand advertising data collection and targeting processes, relying on imprecise mental models. While some appreciate relevant content and understand the role of ads in supporting free content, many find browser tracking invasive and are concerned about discrimination and inaccurate inferences. Studies show that learning about targeted advertising can lead to more negative feelings towards personalization. Improving the design of transparency tools is crucial, as vague explanations decrease trust in personalized advertising.

**3. Method**
To examine Twitter ad targeting data, we designed an online survey-based study with two parts. First, participants requested and uploaded their Twitter data. The survey included sections on participants' reactions to different targeting types and a within-subjects experiment measuring reactions to six potential ad explanations. We iteratively developed the survey through cognitive interviews and pilot testing.

**3.1 Study Recruitment**
We recruited 447 participants from Proliﬁc, paying $0.86 for requesting their Twitter data. Participants were required to be at least 18 years old, live in the US or UK, have a 95%+ approval rating on Proliﬁc, use Twitter at least monthly, and be willing to upload their Twitter ad data.
