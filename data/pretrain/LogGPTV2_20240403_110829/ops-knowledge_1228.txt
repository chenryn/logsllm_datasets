User: How to set up a failover cluster to ensure automatic switchover to a standby node if the primary node fails
Assistant: To set up a failover cluster, you can follow the steps below: 1. Select an appropriate cluster management software or tool, such as Pacemaker, Keepalived, etc., and install and configure according to the corresponding documentation. 2. Add the primary node and the standby node to the same cluster, and determine the method of synchronizing data between the primary node and the standby node. Technologies such as shared storage, file synchronization, and database synchronization can be used to ensure data synchronization between the active and standby nodes. 3. Specify the priority of the primary node and standby node, and set the way to monitor the status of the primary node. For example, heartbeat detection, ping, etc. can be used to detect whether the master node is working normally. If the primary node fails, the backup node will be started automatically. 4. According to the characteristics of application services, set up concepts such as resource groups, resources, and services, and configure the state transition conditions of resources and the startup sequence of services. For example, you can set the virtual IP of the web service, the data directory of the database service, etc. 5. Test the failover capabilities of the cluster. You can test whether the failover cluster can work normally by simulating different scenarios such as downtime and restart of the master node. 6. Regularly inspect and maintain the cluster, discover and eliminate faults in time, and ensure the reliability and availability of the cluster. The above are the general steps for setting up a failover cluster. The specific implementation can be adjusted and optimized according to different application environments and technical requirements.
