Frequency (MHz)
Fig. 1: Spectra around 2000 MHz in the case of using AMD
Radeon RX 580: (A) when GPU memory clock frequency is
600 or 4000 MHz, and (B) when frequency is 2000 MHz
Figure 1 (A) shows that we can barely see any signal energy
around 2000 MHz if RX 580 memory clock is not set to the
corresponding level. On the other hand, Figure 1 (B) shows
that we can clearly observe the EM signal of RX 580 memory
clock in the frequency-domain when the clock is set to 2000
MHz. Moreover, we can see that the signal has a large number
of spectral components in the frequency range below 2000
MHz. The reason for such a phenomenon is due to the use
of a hardware feature called spread spectrum clocking (SSC)
for meeting electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations.
EMC standards impose allowable limits on EM signal energy
at any frequency above 30 MHz, and many clock signals (e.g.,
the GPU memory clock) are strong enough to violate such
legal limits. To achieve EMC, SSC uses FM-modulation to
vary the clock frequency over a range so that the time spent
by the clock signal at a particular frequency is reduced and
the energy is spread over that range of frequencies [18].
4The power spectral density (PSD) is computed using the Welch’s method.
The FFT size is 8192, and a Hamming window is used. Ten segments without
overlap are averaged.

Note that, since GDDR5, GPU memory operates with two
types of clocks. One type is referred to as command clock
(CK) that is used for sending commands and addresses, and
the other one is referred to as write clock (WCK) that is used
for data reads and writes. The EM emanations of interest are
speciﬁcally generated by the WCK. In the case of GDDR5, the
frequency of WCK is half the data rate [35]. In the cases of
GDDR5X and GDDR6, the frequency of WCK is half the data
rate if the operating mode is set as double data rate (DDR), or
one fourth the data rate if the operating mode is set as quad
data rate (QDR) [36].
Since many GPUs have different sets of WCK frequencies,
an attacker may exploit this fact to ﬁnd out what GPU is being
used by a victim if this knowledge is unknown to the attacker
beforehand. Essentially, the attacker monitors the spectrum at
all of the possible WCK frequencies and uses the appearance
of the EM signals similar to the one shown in Figure 1 (B) to
determine which WCK frequencies the target GPU has. Such
reconnaissance information can be used to pinpoint potential
GPUs.
B. Activity Identiﬁcation
exploitable,
To be
the EM emanations
should be
computation-dependent so that high-level activities can be
inferred to reveal certain sensitive information. We notice that
the performance level of a modern GPU is usually changed
rapidly to seek a balance between performance and power
consumption. Given a computational activity that creates some
GPU workloads, there can be multiple GPU performance level
switches during the activity. As different activities potentially
impose different loads on GPU at different times, distinct per-
formance level switching behaviors should be induced, which
can thus serve as activity signatures. In the above discussion,
we have learnt the correlation between the performance level
switches and the appearance/disappearance of targeted EM
signals, which implies that the EM emanations of interest can
be leveraged to identify different activities.
To fully capture the behavior of performance level switch-
ing, we may try to monitor all of the frequency ranges where
the GPU memory clock signals can arise in a synchronized
manner. However, our experiments show that such a heavy-
weight approach to gaining a complete picture of switching
behavior is not necessary, but a partial picture concentrating
on when a speciﬁc performance level is switched on/off suf-
ﬁces to distinguish different activities. For instance, Figure 2
demonstrates the spectrograms when launching three different
programs, that are Chrome, Firefox, and LibreOfﬁce Writer, on
a system equipped with an AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU. (The
OS is Ubuntu 18.04 and the GPU driver is AMDGPU 20.20.)
The frequency range on which we focus corresponds to the
second lowest WCK level (c.f. Table I and Figure 1). As we
can see from the ﬁgure, the patterns of stripe appearance on the
spectrograms are distinguishable from each other and we have
also veriﬁed that they are fully repeatable. Thus, such patterns
can be treated as ﬁngerprints to help infer which program is
being launched.

Therefore, we need only to consider one speciﬁc frequency
of WCK and keep track of when the corresponding EM
signal energy appears and disappears in the focused frequency
range to gain knowledge (e.g., in the form of spectrogram)
that can be exploited for activity identiﬁcation. Theoretically,
we may choose any of the possible WCK frequencies, but
empirically, we ﬁnd that
the second lowest one generally
yields the optimal exploitation results. The reasons for the
second lowest WCK frequency being a better choice than
others include: (1) this frequency is reached much more often
than the other higher ones, especially when an activity does
not use the GPU intensively; and (2) we notice that it normally
has a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than the lowest one.
Thus, in the following, if not otherwise speciﬁed, we focus on
the EM emanations generated by the WCK when switched to
its second lowest level.
Note that, to further substantiate the tight correlation be-
tween the patterns of stripe appearance on the spectrograms in
Figure 2 and the WCK frequency switching behavior, we also
obtain the traces of GPU memory clock frequency changes via

Figure 4. We can see that 0° is deﬁned as when the antenna is
orthogonal to the case side from which the motherboard and
GPU are installed, and 90° is deﬁned as when the antenna is
perpendicular to the front side of the case.

an interface exposed by the AMD GPU driver5 and compare
the traces with the spectrograms. The experiments verify that
the patterns well match the frequency change traces, and
Figure 3 shows such an example corresponding to Figure 2
(A), i.e., launching Chrome. In Figure 3, we can see that the
WCK frequency is switched among its three possible levels
(namely the blue dashed line), and we make the line segments
solid and bold when the WCK frequency is switched to its
second lowest one, namely, 2000 MHz. For each of the spectra
constituting the spectrogram in Figure 2 (A), we plot the
average of the magnitudes in the frequency range from 1990
MHz to 2000 MHz (namely the red solid line). As we can see
from the ﬁgure, the local peaks of the averaged magnitude
match closely with the line segments indicating that the WCK
is switched to 2000 MHz.
C. Propagation Distance and Wall Penetration
To exploit a physical side-channel in an air-gapped setting,
we also need to consider how far it can propagate and whether
it can go through obstacles like a wall. To this end, we have
performed several experiments on the GPUs listed in Table I
and found that the EM emanations of interest have a desirable
wall-penetrating property and can be measured by an attacker
from a distance long enough to carry out attacks practically.
The experiments are performed using an SDR device, USRP
B210, and an ultra-wideband directional antenna, RFSPACE
UWB-3. (We also tried a much cheaper device, LimeSDR,
and derived very similar results.) More details about
the
corresponding setup can be found in Appendix A.
Fig. 4: The deﬁnition of directions used in this paper
Figure 5 shows the distances with respect to the directions
from which the EM emanations of interest can still be “picked
up” when there is no obstacle in between the GPU machine
and the antenna. Here we deﬁne “pick up” as that the SNR
after applying the technique described in Section V is at least
7 dB. In general, we can ﬁnd that the longest measurement
distance changes with the direction. Note that, due to our
ofﬁce space limitation, the maximum distance we can reach

580, we need to double the reading to get the current WCK frequency.

Figure 5 shows two scenarios in which two types of
computer cases are used. In the ﬁrst scenario, a modern-
looking computer case with a translucent side panel is used
(as shown in Figure 4), and in the second scenario, a computer
case whose every side is made of metal is used. Comparing
Figure 5 (A) and (B), we can observe that the translucent
side panel in the ﬁrst scenario beneﬁts the propagation of
the exploitable EM signals. As illustrated by Figure 5 (A),
when a modern-looking case is used, we can capture the EM
emanations of our interest from more than 3 meters away in
