Hello!
I noticed that in my Google Chrome and IE Bootstrap's labels and badges
contain strange padding. In Firefox all looks OK.  
Please find attached a screenshot of official Bootstrap web site in my
browsers.  
P.S. I thought there is some problem with my computer or OS (Windows 7,
1366x769 resolution), but anyway I'd like to share this issue
Alex
