Subject: Issue with Padding in Bootstrap Labels and Badges on Google Chrome and IE

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well.

I have noticed an issue with the padding in Bootstrap's labels and badges when using Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. In Firefox, everything appears as expected. 

For your reference, I have attached a screenshot from the official Bootstrap website, which demonstrates the discrepancy in my browsers. The issue is visible on both Google Chrome and Internet Explorer, while it does not occur in Firefox.

Here are the details of my setup:
- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **Screen Resolution:** 1366x769

Initially, I thought the problem might be related to my computer or operating system, but I wanted to bring this to your attention in case it is a more widespread issue.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Alex
