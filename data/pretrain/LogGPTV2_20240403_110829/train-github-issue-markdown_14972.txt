Hi, I'm trying to use _getAllDisplays()_ API under Windows and I have a very
strange behaviour.
Code:
    const screen = require('electron').screen
    const arr = screen.getAllDisplays()
    console.log(arr)
Use case:
  1. Start the electron app
  2. Call the above code
  3. I get the monitor array in the output
  4. I change the resolution/disable external monitor/etc
  5. I re run the code of above ( **without relaunching** the electron app)
  6. I obtain the same output of the point 3), nothing changed. (in some case I get duplicate monitors)
Under OSX there's no problem.  
I guess this problem is related to #3075.
In conclusion, work with the screen API under Windows is basically impossible.
  * Electron version: 0.37.4
  * Operating system: Windows
