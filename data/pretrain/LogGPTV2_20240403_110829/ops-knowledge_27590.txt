User: I have an application on app engine, and this application has an entity called Appointment. An  Appointment has a start_time and a end_time. I want to fetch appointments based on the time, so I want to get all appointments for a given day, for example.
Since app engine doesn't support inequality query based on two fields, what can I do?
Assistant: You could add another field for the date. A ComputedProperty would probably make sense for that.
Or you could fetch from the start of the day, in batches, and stop fetching once you reach the end of your day. I'd imagine you could come up with a sensible default based on how many appointments you'd typically have in one day to keep this reasonably efficient.
