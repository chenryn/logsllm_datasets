Application Activity Distribution List PCF Group Header Structure
If the MQOPEN function opens a distribution list, then the MQOPEN parameters includes one
AppActivityDistList PCF group for each of the queues in the distribution list up to the number of structures
numbered in RecsPresent. The Ap-pActivityDistList PCF group combines information from the MQOR, and
MQRR structures to identify the queue name, and indicate the result of the open operation on the queue.
An AppActivityDistList group always starts with the following MQCFGR structure:
