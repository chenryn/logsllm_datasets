2)  Active  Mass  Degradation/Shedding.  It  contains  many 
complex aging processes in the positive active mass (PAM) and 
the  negative  active  mass  (NAM).  It  leads  to  a  change  in  the 
microstructure (e.g. active mass softening, recrystallization, loss 
of  surface  of  active  mass,  etc.  [25]).  The  AM  shedding 
represents  the  active  mass  is  permanently  removed  from  the 
electrode. The AM degradation/shedding are usually accelerated 
by a high Ah throughput, very low states of charge (SOC) and 
fast temperature changes.  
3) Irreversible Formation of Lead Sulfate. It is also known 
as  sulphation.  When  the  electrodes  are  discharged,  the  active 
masses  (PbO2  and  Pb)  are  transformed  into  PbSO4  [16]. 
However, if a battery is not recharged timely, sulphate crystals 
can grow almost linearly with the solubility of sulphate ions and 
temperature.  In  this  case,  the  active  masses  are  irreversibly 
in 
converted 
electrochemical reactions [26]. This process is accelerated if a 
battery keeps running at low SOC.  
to  PbSO4  and  can  no 
longer  participate 
4)  Loss  of  Water.  In  a  valve-regulated  lead-acid  (VRLA) 
battery, water can gradually diminish due to extensive gassing. 
In  a  VRLA  battery,  water  cannot  be  re-filled  and  the  aging 
process  is  called  drying  out  [27].  Over-charging  and  high 
battery temperature can affect the loss rate of water. 
5) Electrolyte Stratification. The vertical distribution of the 
electrolyte  density  in  battery  is  different,  which  leads  to  a 
preferred discharge at the bottom and preferred charge at the top 
of  the  electrolyte.  The  heterogeneous  distribution  accelerates 
sulphation  at  the  bottom  of  the  electrodes.  The  stratification 
aging occur on the battery that is rarely fully recharged and the 
cells  are  deeply  discharged  with  very  low  current  [28].  It 
reduces the available capacity of a battery. 
In general, the aging of battery is a synergistic effect of the 
above  factors.  Without  careful  management,  cyclically  used 
batteries  can  age  quickly.  They  are  often  the  hidden  cause  of 
undesired  load  shedding  (for  green  datacenters  that  have 
stringent  power  budget)  and  unnecessary  renewable  energy 
feedback (sold at an unprofitable energy price to the utility grid, 
e.g., 40% of the whole sale price [5]).  
As  shown  in  Figure  3,  over  a  continuous  operation  of  six 
months, the terminal voltage of a battery (fully charged) in our 
system  can  be  decreased  by  approximately  9%.  Although  the 
average  server  loading  is  relatively  the  same,  the  voltage 
dropping rate increases as battery ages (0.1V/Month from Apr. 
to Jun. and about 0.3V/Month from Jul. to Sep.). Low terminal 
voltage often triggers emergency handling as the under-voltage 
battery  cannot  sustain  high-current  drawn  and  may  be 
disconnected from the system [29]. In addition, the effectively 
stored energy in each charging cycle has also dropped by 14% 
under  aggressive  usage  (Figure  4).  Typically,  a  battery  unit  is 
considered at end-of-life (i.e., not suitable for backup purpose in 
mission  critical  systems)  when  it  fails  to  deliver  80%  of  its

initial  capacity  [30].  If  used  as  green  energy  buffer,  such  an 
aged  battery  can  cause  degraded  energy  efficiency.  Our 
historical  record  shows  that  after  six  months  the  round-trip 
efficiency has decreased by 8%, as shown in Figure 5.  
III.  MODELING AND QUANTIFYING BATTERY AGING  
  Battery operating conditions (different voltage, current and 
temperature) largely determine the rate of aging processes. If we 
pose  battery  in  different  operating  conditions  and  use  it  for  a 
long term, it will lead to distinct aging processes. In this section, 
we calibrate the impact of different operating conditions using 
five  metrics.  Figure  6  shows  the  correlation  between  these 
metrics  and  different  aging  mechanisms.  These  metrics 
quantitatively  reflect  battery  aging  progresses  and  allow  us  to 
devise power management policies for handling various battery 
aging issues at the computer architecture level. 
A.  Normalized Ah Throughput (NAT)  
The  Ah  throughput  is  defined  as  the  ratio  between  the 
cumulative  ampere-hour  (Ah)  output  of  a  battery  and  the 
nominal total discharge capacity [27]:

In Eq-1, QAT is the cumulative ampere-hour (Ah) output of 
battery from time t0 to T. CAPnom is the nominal life-long output 
of  the  battery.  It  has  been  shown  that  the  aggregated  electric 
charge that can be cycled from a battery (before it wears out) is 
almost  constant  [31,  32].  Therefore,  prior  work  has  used  Ah 
throughput  for  predicting  battery  lifetime  under  different 
charge/discharge conditions [4]. This factor can also be used to 
distinguish between backup battery operations (low NAT) and 
full  cycling  operations  (high  NAT).  A  high  NAT  value 
increases active mass degradation and shedding [32]. 
B.  Charge Factor (CF) 
The charge factor is expressed as the ratio of cumulative Ah 
throughput between battery charging and discharging:

the  operating 
conditions  of  a  battery  (e.g.,  partial  discharging  or  float 
charging). Typically the charge ratio is between 1~1.3 [27]. In 
normal partial cycling conditions, the charge factor is close to 1. 
If the battery frequently receives float charge, its charge factor 
can increase dramatically. When the charge  factor is too low, 
sulphation  and  stratification  may  become  the  major  causes  of 
fast  aging.  If  the  charge  factor  is  above  its  normal  range,  the 
following  aging  mechanisms  may  be  accelerated:  active  mass 
shedding, water loss, and corrosion. 
C.  Partial Cycling (PC)  
PC reflects how a battery is used. The state of charge (SoC) 
of battery is divided into four ranges: A (100%-80%), B (79%-
60%), C (59%-40%) and D (39%-0%). The probability of the 
Ah output being in range X is given by:

(D)
(cid:117)
(cid:117)
(cid:117)
3+PC
2 + PC
1 +PC
(cid:117)
PC = (PC
In Eq-3, the numerator is the cumulative Ah output during 
the time the battery falls into SoC range X. The partial cycling 
value is then calculated by weighting functions as below: 
4)/4
(cid:3)
(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:23)(cid:12)(cid:3)
In Eq-4, the linear weighting factors reflect that the cycling at 
high SoC has less damaging for battery aging than the cycling 
at  low  SoC  [28].  The  higher  value  of  PC  will  accelerate  the 
battery aging such as corrosion and electrolyte stratification. 
D.  Deep Discharge Time (DDT) 
This  factor  expresses  the  percentage  (%)  of  the  entire 
period (from t0 to T) within which the battery operates below 
40% SoC. It can be calculated as:

In Eq-5, H is the Heaviside Step Function (H(x)=0, if x<0; 
H(x)=1, if x≥0). Staying at a low SoC accelerates irreversible 
sulphation.  In  contrast  to  PC,  this  factor  is  based  only  on  the 
time and not on the Ah throughput. 
E.  Discharge Rate (DR) 
Low  discharge  rate  (Ampere)  has  little  impact  on  battery 
aging  processes.  But  high  discharge  rate  during  low  SoC 
duration  can  significantly  accelerate  aging.  For  example,  the 
high discharge rate which exceeds the tolerable range can cause 
increased  battery  temperature.  Taking  the  battery  lifetime  at 
20℃ as a baseline, a 10 ℃ temperature increase will result in a 
reduction of the lifetime by 50% [26].  
IV.  HIDING, SLOWING DOWN, AND PLANNING 
BATTERY AGING IN A GREEN DATACENTER  
This  section  discusses  how  to  alleviate  the  deleterious 
effect of battery aging. We first present the detailed design of 
our battery anti-aging treatment (BAAT) framework. We then 
elaborate  how  to  hide  aging,  slow  down  aging,  and  plan  the 
aging speed of battery in green datacenters. 
A.  BAAT Framework Overview 
Figure  7  depicts  the  schematic  diagram  of  BAAT.  Our 
framework  contains  a  sensor-table  based  power  monitoring 
architecture  and  a  workload  scheduler,  which  are  built  on  the 
emerging  distributed  energy  storage  architecture  [1-3].  BAAT 
supports two types of distributed energy storage architectures: 1) 
each server is equipped with a separate battery (similar to that in 
Google  datacenters  [1])  and  2)  several  racks  share  a  pool  of 
batteries (akin to Facebook’s Open Rack design [3]).
