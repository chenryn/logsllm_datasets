ABSTRACT
As Internet users have become more savvy about the potential for
their Internet communication to be observed, the use of network
traffic encryption technologies (e.g., HTTPS/TLS) is on the rise.
However, even when encryption is enabled, users leak information
about the domains they visit via DNS queries and via the Server
Name Indication (SNI) extension of TLS. Two recent proposals to
ameliorate this issue are DNS over HTTPS/TLS (DoH/DoT) and
Encrypted SNI (ESNI). In this paper we aim to assess the privacy
benefits of these proposals by considering the relationship between
hostnames and IP addresses, the latter of which are still exposed.
We perform DNS queries from nine vantage points around the
globe to characterize this relationship. We quantify the privacy
gain offered by ESNI for different hosting and CDN providers using
two different metrics, the k-anonymity degree due to co-hosting
and the dynamics of IP address changes. We find that 20% of the
domains studied will not gain any privacy benefit since they have
a one-to-one mapping between their hostname and IP address. On
the other hand, 30% will gain a significant privacy benefit with a
k value greater than 100, since these domains are co-hosted with
more than 100 other domains. Domains whose visitors’ privacy
will meaningfully improve are far less popular, while for popular
domains the benefit is not significant. Analyzing the dynamics of
IP addresses of long-lived domains, we find that only 7.7% of them
change their hosting IP addresses on a daily basis. We conclude
by discussing potential approaches for website owners and host-
ing/CDN providers for maximizing the privacy benefits of ESNI.

1 INTRODUCTION
As users become more aware of the importance of protecting their
online communication, the adoption of TLS is increasing [60]. It is
indicative that almost 200M fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs)
support TLS [38], while Let’s Encrypt [3] has issued a billion cer-
tificates as of February 27, 2020 [4]. Although TLS significantly
improves the confidentiality of Internet traffic, on its own it cannot
fully protect user privacy, especially when it comes to monitoring
the websites a user visits.
Currently, visited domain names are exposed in both i) DNS
requests, which remain unencrypted, and ii) the Server Name Indi-
cation (SNI) extension [56] during the TLS handshake. As a result,
on-path observers can fully monitor the domain names visited by
web users through simple eavesdropping of either DNS requests or
TLS handshake traffic. Several recent proposals aim to improve the
security and privacy of these two protocols. Specifically, DNS over
HTTPS (DoH) [53] and DNS over TLS (DoT) [55] aim to preserve
the integrity and confidentiality of DNS resolutions against threats
“below the recursive,” such as DNS poisoning [32], while Encrypted
Server Name Indication (ESNI) [89] aims to prevent “nosy” ISPs and
other on-path entities from observing the actual visited domain of
a given TLS connection.
In this paper, we quantify the potential improvement to user
privacy that a full deployment of DoH/DoT and ESNI would achieve
in practice, given that destination IP addresses still remain visible to
on-path observers. Although it is straightforward to reveal a user’s
visited site if the destination IP address hosts only that particular
domain, when a given destination IP address serves many domains,
an adversary will have to “guess” which one is being visited.
We use two properties to quantify the potential privacy benefit
of ESNI, assuming the provider of the DoH/DoT server used is fully
trusted (as it can still observe all visited domains): the k-anonymity
property and the dynamics of hosting IP addresses. Assuming that
k different websites are co-hosted on a given IP address (all using
HTTPS with ESNI supported), the privacy of a visitor to one of
those sites increases as the number of k-1 other co-hosted sites
increases. In addition, the more dynamic the hosting IP address is
for a given site, the higher the privacy benefit of its visitors is, as
the mapping between domain and hosting IP address becomes less
stable, and thus less predictable.
To quantify these two properties, we conducted active DNS mea-
surements to obtain the IP addresses of an average of 7.5M FQDNs
per day drawn from lists of popular websites [7, 70] (§4). To account
for sites served from content delivery networks (CDNs) which may
direct users differently based on their location, we performed name
resolutions from nine locations around the world: Brazil, Germany,
India, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, United
States, and South Africa. Our measurements were conducted in
two months to investigate how much a network observer can learn
about the domains visited by a user based solely on the IP address
information captured from encrypted traffic.
We find that 20% of the domains studied will not benefit at
all from ESNI, due to their stable one-to-one mappings between
domain name and hosting IP address. For the rest of the domains,
only 30% will gain a significant privacy benefit with a k value
greater than 100, which means an adversary can correctly guess
these domains with a probability lower than 1%. The rest 50% of
the domains can still gain some privacy benefits, but at a lower
level (i.e., 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). While sophisticated website fingerprinting
attacks based on several characteristics of network packets (e.g.,
timing and size [45, 68, 74, 78, 79, 101]) can be used to predict the
visited domains, our study aims to provide a lower bound of what
an attacker can achieve.
Moreover, we observe that sites hosted by the top-ten hosting
providers with the highest privacy value (k > 500) are far less
popular (§5.2). These are often less well-known sites hosted on
small hosting providers that tend to co-locate many websites on a
single IP or server. In contrast, the vast majority of more popular
sites would gain a much lower level of privacy. These sites are often
hosted by major providers, including Cloudflare (k = 16), Amazon
(3 ≤ k ≤ 5), Google (k = 5), GoDaddy (k = 4), and Akamai (k = 3).
In addition, we find that frequently changing IP addresses (at
least once a day) are limited to only 7.7% of the domains that we
were able to resolve each day of our study. As expected, dominant
providers in terms of more dynamic IP addresses include major
CDN providers, such as Amazon, Akamai, and Cloudflare (§5.4).
Finally, we validate and compare our main findings by repeat-
ing part of our analysis using two different public DNS datasets
(§6), and provide recommendations for both website owners and
hosting/CDN providers on how to maximize the privacy benefit
offered by the combination of DoH/DoT and ESNI (§7). In particular,
website owners may want to seek hosting services from—the un-
fortunately quite few—providers that maximize the ratio between
co-hosted domains per IP address, and minimize the duration of
domain-to-IP mappings. Hosting providers, on the other hand, can
hopefully aid in maximizing the privacy benefits of ESNI by increas-
ing the unpredictability of domain-to-IP mappings.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide an overview of the shortcomings of DNS
and TLS when it comes to user privacy, along with the suggested
improvements of DNS over HTTPS/TLS (DoH/DoT) and Encrypted
Server Name Indication (ESNI).
2.1 DNS and DoH/DoT
The DNS protocol exposes all requests and responses in plaintext,
allowing anyone with the privilege to monitor or modify a user’s
network traffic to eavesdrop or tamper with it. For example, a man-
on-the-side attacker can send spoofed DNS responses to redirect a
victim to malicious websites [32], while state-level organizations
can manipulate DNS responses to disrupt connections for censor-
ship purposes. The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [36] were
introduced in 1997 to cope with these and other security issues by
assuring the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses (but not
their confidentiality). However, DNSSEC is still not widely deployed
due to deployment difficulties and compatibility issues [23, 29, 44].
As an attempt to enhance the security and privacy of the DNS
protocol, two emerging DNS standards were recently proposed:
DoH [53] and DoT [55]. These technologies aim to not only ensure
the integrity and authenticity of DNS traffic, but also its confidential-
ity to some extent. Using DoH/DoT, all DNS queries and responses
are transmitted over TLS, ensuring their integrity against last-mile
adversaries who would otherwise be in a position to launch man-
in-the-middle (MiTM) and man-on-the-side (MoTS) attacks. In this
work, we specifically characterize the protection of user privacy
from nosy ISPs and other last-mile entities provided by DoH/DoT.
Although the benefits of DoH/DoT against last-mile adversaries
are clear, this comes with the cost of fully trusting a third-party op-
erator of the DoH/DoT resolver on which users have outsourced all
their DNS resolutions [51]. Several companies already offer public
DoH/DoT resolvers, including Google [42, 43] and Cloudflare [108].
In fact, we later show in §5.2 that these two companies are also
the most dominant hosting providers of domains in the top lists
of popular sites. Popular browsers have also started introducing
support for DoH/DoT, e.g., Mozilla Firefox since version 62 [72]
(which is now enabled by default).
2.2 SSL/TLS and ESNI
During the TLS handshake [31], the two communicating parties
exchange messages to acknowledge and verify the other side using
digital certificates, and agree on various parameters that will be
used to create an encrypted channel. In a client-server model, the
client trusts a digital certificate presented by the server as long as
it has been signed by a trusted certificate authority.
Ideally, private or sensitive information should be transmitted
only after the TLS handshake has completed. This goal can be easily
achieved when a server hosts only a single domain (known as IP-
based virtual hosting). Name-based virtual hosting, however, which
is an increasingly used approach for enabling multiple domains
to be hosted on a single server, necessitates a mechanism for the
server to know which domain name a user intends to visit before the
TLS handshake completes, in order to present the right certificate.
The Server Name Indication (SNI) extension was introduced in
2003 as a solution to this problem. The SNI extension contains a
field with the domain name the client wants to visit, so that the
server can then present the appropriate certificate. Unfortunately,
since this step is conducted prior to the completion of the TLS
handshake, the domain name specified in SNI is exposed in plaintext.
Consequently, all the privacy risks associated with the traditional
design of DNS discussed above also apply to the SNI extension. For
instance, Internet authorities in several countries have been relying
on the SNI field for censorship purposes [21, 49].
ESNI has recently been proposed as part of TLS version 1.3 [89] to
resolve the issue of SNI revealing the domain visited by a user. Using
ESNI, clients encrypt the SNI field towards a given server by first
obtaining a server-specific public key through a well-known ESNI
DNS record. Obviously, due to this reliance on DNS, any privacy
benefits of ESNI can only be realized when used in conjunction with
DoH/DoT—otherwise any last-mile observer would still be able to
observe a user’s plaintext DNS queries and infer the visited TLS
server. In September 2018, Cloudflare was among the first providers
to announce support for ESNI across its network [83].
3 THREAT MODEL
We assume an idealistic future scenario in which both DoH/DoT and
ESNI are fully deployed on the Internet. Under this assumption, an
on-path observer will only be able to rely on the remaining visible
information, i.e., destination IP addresses, to infer the sites being
visited by the monitored users. The extent to which this inference
