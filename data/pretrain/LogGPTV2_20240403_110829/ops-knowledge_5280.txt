User: Ubuntu (10.10) came installed with Python2.6, 2.7, and 3. In addition, I have installed the Enthought Python Distribution. Is there any way to manage Python packages within these distributions intelligently?
For compatibility, I'd imagine switching between these distributions occasionally. If I install PyBlah, I'd like it to be available under all of the distributions. Can I do better than installing PyBlah under each distribution?
Assistant: Virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper make managing packages very nice!
