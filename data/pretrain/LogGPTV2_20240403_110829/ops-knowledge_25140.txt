User: How to use the Git version control management tool to realize multi-person collaborative development and code merging? Please explain the basic principle and specific operation steps.
Assistant: Git is a powerful version control management tool that supports multi-person collaborative development and code merging. Its basic principle is to copy a copy of the developer's code file to the Git local warehouse, each developer modifies and submits in his own local warehouse, and then uses the Git tool to merge the code, and finally the code of all developers Merged into a shared repository. The following are the specific steps: 1. Install Git and create a local warehouse. Create an empty Git repository in a local folder using the "git init" command. 2. Associate the local warehouse with the remote warehouse. Use the "git remote add origin remote warehouse address" command to associate the local warehouse with the remote warehouse. 3. Create a new branch in the local repository. Use the "git branch new branch name" command to create a new branch in the local repository. 4. Switch to the new branch. Use the "git checkout new branch name" command to switch to the new branch. 5. Development and modification. Develop and modify in the new branch. 6. Commit your changes. Use the "git add file name" command to add the modified file to the temporary storage area, and then use the "git commit -m commit information" command to submit the modified file to the local warehouse. 7. Push the code in the local branch to the remote warehouse. Use the "git push origin branch name" command to push the code in the local branch to the remote warehouse. 8. Merge the branches. When multiple developers are developing in different branches, you need to use the "git merge branch name" command to merge the code in different branches together. 9. Resolve conflicts. When the code in different branches has conflicts, you need to manually resolve the conflicts, and then submit the code again. The above is the basic principle and specific operation steps of Git multi-person collaborative development and code merging. It is important to note that Git is a highly flexible and powerful tool that requires proficiency in order to effectively manage a codebase.
