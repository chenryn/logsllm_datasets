User: How to set up Nginx load balancing and ensure high availability?
Assistant: To achieve Nginx load balancing and ensure high availability, you can follow the steps below: 1. Prepare multiple servers: You need to prepare multiple servers that provide the same service, and each server needs to install the corresponding software and configuration. 2. Install Nginx: Choose one of these servers to install Nginx, and configure Nginx load balancing strategies, such as polling, IP-hash, least_conn, etc. 3. Configure Nginx: To ensure high availability, you need to specify a backup server in the Nginx configuration file. If the primary server fails, Nginx will automatically redirect traffic to the backup server. 4. Configure health check: Nginx provides a health check mechanism that can periodically check whether the server can respond to requests. If a server fails to respond, Nginx removes it from the load balancing pool, ensuring that requests are not forwarded to the failed server. 5. Configure automated operation and maintenance: You can use automated operation and maintenance tools, such as Ansible, Saltstack, etc., to automatically manage Nginx configuration files and server status, improving operation and maintenance efficiency and reliability. Through the above steps, Nginx load balancing can be achieved and high availability can be ensured, thereby improving application performance and reliability.
