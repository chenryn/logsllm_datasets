### [Life review](life_review.md)
* New: [Thoughts on the reviews themselves.](life_review.md#thoughts-on-the-reviews-themselves)
    - Keep It Simple: It's important for the process to be light enough that you want to actually do it, so you see it as a help instead of a burden. It's always better to do a small and quick review rather than nothing at all. At the start of the review analyze yourself to assess how much energy do you have and decide which steps of the review you want to do.
    - Review approaches: In the past I used the [life logging](life_logging.md) tools to analyze the past in order to understand what I achieved and take it as a base to learn from my mistakes. It was useful when I needed the endorphines boost of seeing all the progress done. Once I assumed that progress speed and understood that we always do the best we can given how we are, I started to feel that the review process was too cumbersome and that it was holding me into the past.
      Nowadays I try not to look back but forward, analyze the present: how I feel, how's the environment around me, and how can I tweak both to fulfill my life goals. This approach leads to less reviewing of achievements and logs and more introspection, thinking and imagining. Which although may be slower to correct mistakes of the past, will surely make you live closer to the utopy.
      The reviews below then follow that second approach.
    - Personal alive reviews: Reviews have to reflect ourselves, and we change continuously, so take for granted that your review is going to change.
      I've gone for full blown reviews of locking myself up for a week to not doing reviews for months.
      This article represent the guidelines I follow to do my life review. It may
      seem a lot to you or may be very simple. Please take it as a base or maybe to
      get some ideas and then create your own that fits your needs.
* New: [Update the Month review process.](life_review.md#month-review-tools)
* New: [When to do the trimester reviews.](life_review.md#when-to-do-the-trimester-reviews)
    As with [moth reviews](life_review.md#month-review), it's interesting to do analysis at representative moments. It gives it an emotional weight. You can for example use the solstices or my personal version of the solstices:
    - Spring analysis (1st of March): For me the spring is the real start of the year, it's when life explodes after the stillness of the winter. The sun starts to set later enough so that you have light in the afternoons, the climate gets warmer thus inviting you to be more outside, the nature is blooming new leaves and flowers. It is then a moment to build new projects and set the current year on track.
    - Summer analysis (1st of June): I hate heat, so summer is a moment of retreat. Everyone temporarily stop their lives, we go on holidays and all social projects slow their pace. Even the news have even less interesting things to report. It's so hot outside that some of us seek the cold refuge of home or remote holiday places. Days are long and people love to hang out till late, so usually you wake up later, thus having less time to actually do stuff. Even in the moments when you are alone the heat drains your energy to be productive. It is then a moment to relax and gather forces for the next trimester. It's also perfect to develop *easy* and *chill* personal projects that have been forgotten in a drawer. Lower your expectations and just flow with what your body asks you.
    - Autumn analysis (1st of September): September it's another key moment for many people. We have it hardcoded in our life since we were children as it was the start of school. People feel energized after the summer holidays and are eager to get back to their lives and stopped projects. You're already 6 months into the year, so it's a good moment to review your year plan and decide how you want to invest your energy reserves.
    - Winter analysis (1st of December): December is the cue that the year is coming to an end. The days grow shorter and colder, they basically invite you to enjoy a cup of tea under a blanket. It is then a good time to get into your cave and do an introspection analysis on the whole year and prepare the ground for the coming year. Some of the goals of this season are:
      - Think everything you need to guarantee a good, solid and powerful spring start.
      - Do the year review to adjust your principles.
    The year is then divided in two sets of an expansion trimester and a retreat one. We can use this information to adjust our life plan accordingly. In the expansion trimester we could invest more energies in the planning, and in the retreat ones we can do more throughout reviews.
* New: [The principle documents.](life_review.md#the-principle-documents)
    Principle documents for me are [orgmode](orgmode.md) documents where I think about the principle itself. It acts both as a way of understanding it and evolving my idea around it, and to build the roadmap to materialize the principle's path.
    Without ever having created one I feel that it makes sense to make the reflection part public in the blue book, while I keep for myself the private one. This may also change between principles.
* New: [The life path document.](life_review.md#the-life-path-document)
    The life path document is an [orgmode](orgmode.md) document where I think about what I want to do with my life and how. It's the highest level of abstraction of the life management system.
    The structure so far is as follows:
    ```orgmode
    * Life path
    ** {year}
    *** Principles of {season} {year}
        {Notes on the season}
        - Principle 1
        - Principle 2
        ...
    **** Objectives of {month} {year}
         - [-] Objective 1
           - [X] SubObjective 1
           - [ ] SubObjective 2
         - [ ] Objective 2
         - [ ] ...
    ```
    Where the principles are usually links to principle documents and the objectives links to tasks.
* New: [Trimester prepare.](life_review.md#trimester-prepare)
    The trimester review requires an analysis that doesn't fill in a day session. It requires slow thinking over some time. So I'm creating a task 10 days before the actual review to start thinking about the next trimester. Whether it's ideas, plans, desires, objectives, or principles.
    Is useful for that document to be available wherever you go, so that in any spare time you can pop it up and continue with the train of thought.
    Doing the reflection without seeing your life path prevents you from being tainted by it, thus representing the real you of right now.
    On the day to actually do the review, follow the steps of the [Month review prepare](life_review.md#month-prepare) adjusting them to the trimester case.
## Task Management
### [Org Mode](orgmode.md)
* New: [Start working on a task dates.](orgmode.md#start-working-on-a-task-dates)
    `SCHEDULED` defines when you are plan to start working on that task.
    The headline is listed under the given date. In addition, a reminder that the scheduled date has passed is present in the compilation for today, until the entry is marked as done or [disabled](#how-to-deal-with-overdue-SCHEDULED-and-DEADLINE-tasks).
    ```org
    *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
        SCHEDULED: 
    ```
    Although is not a good idea (as it promotes the can pushing through the street), if you want to delay the display of this task in the agenda, use `SCHEDULED: ` the task is still scheduled on the 25th but will appear two days later. In case the task contains a repeater, the delay is considered to affect all occurrences; if you want the delay to only affect the first scheduled occurrence of the task, use `--2d` instead.
    Scheduling an item in Org mode should not be understood in the same way that we understand scheduling a meeting. Setting a date for a meeting is just [a simple appointment](#appointments), you should mark this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown on the date where it applies. This is a frequent misunderstanding by Org users. In Org mode, scheduling means setting a date when you want to start working on an action item.
    You can set it with `s` (Default: `ois`)
* New: [Deadlines.](orgmode.md#deadlines)
    `DEADLINE` are like [appointments](#appointments) in the sense that it defines when the task is supposed to be finished on. On the deadline date, the task is listed in the agenda. The difference with appointments is that you also see the task in your agenda if it is overdue and you can set a warning about the approaching deadline, starting `org_deadline_warning_days` before the due date (14 by default). It's useful then to set `DEADLINE` for those tasks that you don't want to miss that the deadline is over.
    An example:
    ```org
    * TODO Do this
    DEADLINE: 
    ```
    You can set it with `d` (Default: `oid`).
    If you need a different warning period for a special task, you can specify it. For example setting a warning period of 5 days `DEADLINE: `.
    If you're as me, you may want to remove the warning feature of `DEADLINES` to be able to keep your agenda clean. Most of times you are able to finish the task in the day, and for those that you can't specify a `SCHEDULED` date. To do so set the default number of days to `0`.
    ```lua
    require('orgmode').setup({
      org_deadline_warning_days = 0,
    })
    ```
    Using too many tasks with a `DEADLINE` will clutter your agenda. Use it only for the actions that you need to have a reminder, instead try to using [appointment](#appointments) dates instead. The problem of using appointments is that once the date is over you don't get a reminder in the agenda that it's overdue, if you need this, use `DEADLINE` instead.
* New: [How to deal with overdue SCHEDULED and DEADLINE tasks.](orgmode.md#how-to-deal-with-overdue-scheduled-and-deadline-tasks.)
* New: Introduce org-rw.
    [`org-rw`](https://github.com/kenkeiras/org-rw) is a Python library to process your orgmode files.
    Installation:
    ```bash
    pip install org-rw
    ```
    Load an orgmode file:
    ```python
    from org_rw import load
    with open('your_file.org', 'r') as f:
        doc = load(f)
    ```
## [Habit management](habit_management.md)
* New: Introduce habit management.
    A [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit) is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.
    A [2002 daily experience study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.83.6.1281) found that approximately 43% of daily behaviors are performed out of habit. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are hard to break and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns that humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.
    When behaviors are repeated in a consistent context, there is an incremental increase in the link between the context and the action. This increases the automaticity of the behavior in that context. Features of an automatic behavior are all or some of: efficiency, lack of awareness, unintentionality, and uncontrollability.
    Mastering habit formation can be a powerful tool to change yourself. Usually with small changes you get massive outcomes in the long run. The downside is that it's not for the impatient people as it often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold that unlocks a new level of performance.
* New: [Why are habits interesting.](habit_management.md#why-are-habits-interesting)
    Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Habits are a series of automatic resolutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.
    As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what you look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.
    Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. Habits reduce the cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so they can be carried on with your nonconscious mind and you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
* New: [Identity focused changes.](habit_management.md#identity-focused-changes)
    Changing our habits is challenging because we try to change the wrong thing in the wrong way.
    There are three levels at which change can occur:
    - Outcomes: Changing your results. Goals fall under this category: publishing a book, run daily
    - Process: Changing your habits and systems: decluttering your desk for a better workflow, developing a meditation practice.
    - Identity: Changing your beliefs, assumptions and biases: your world view, your self-image, your judgments.
    Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
    The first path of change is doomed because maintaining behaviours that are incongruent with the self is expensive and will not last. Even if they make rational sense. Thus it's hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behaviour. On the other hand it's easy to find motivation once a habit has changed your identity as you may be proud of it and will be willing to maintain all the habits and systems associated with it. For example: The goal is not to read a book, but to become a reader.
    Focusing on outcomes may also bring the next problems:
    - Focusing on the results may lead you to temporal solutions. If you focus on the source of the issue at hand you may solve it with less effort and get you to a more stable one.
    - Goals create an "either-or" conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are disappointed. Thus you only get a positive reward if you fulfill a goal. If you instead focus on the process rather than the result, you will be satisfied anytime your system is running.
    - When your hard work is focused on a goal you may feel depleted once you meet it and that could make you loose the condition that made you meet the goal in the first place.
    Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. This of course is a double-edged sword. Identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, identity change can be a curse.
* New: [Changing your identity.](habit_management.md#changing-your-identity)
    Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.
    Your habits and systems are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. The more you repeat a behaviour, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behaviour. To the point that your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.
    Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.
    Once you start the ball rolling things become easier as building habits is a feedback loop. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.
    The most practical way to change the identity is to:
    - [Decide the type of person you want to be](habit_management.md#decide-the-type-of-person-you-want-to-be)
    - Prove it to yourself with small wins
    Another advantage of focusing in what type of person you want to be is that maybe the outcome you wanted to focus on is not the wisest smallest step to achieve your identity change. Thinking on the identity you want to embrace can make you think outside the box.
* New: [Decide the type of person you want to be.](habit_management.md#decide-the-type-of-person-you-want-to-be)
    One way to decide the person you want to be is to answer big questions like: what do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become?
    As we're more result oriented, another way is to work backwards from them to the person you want to be. Ask yourself: Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?
* New: [How to change a habit.](habit_management.md#how-to-change-a-habit)
    The process of building a habit from a behaviour can be divided into four stages:
    - **Reward** is the end goal.
    - **Cue** is the trigger in your brain that initiate a behaviour. It's contains the information that predicts a reward.
    - **Cravings** are the motivational force fueled by the desire of the reward. Without motivation we have no reason to act.
    - **Response** is the thought or action you perform to obtain the reward. The response depends on the amount of motivation you have, how much friction is associated with the behaviour and your ability to actually do it.
    If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won't have enough motivation to act. Make the behaviour difficult and you won't be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.
    We chase rewards because they:
    - Deliver contentment.
    - Satisfy your craving.
    - Teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.
    If a reward is met then it becomes associated with the cue, thus closing the habit feedback loop.
    If we keep these stages in mind then:
    - To build good habits we need to:
        - Cue: Make it obvious
        - Craving: Make it attractive
        - Response: Make it easy
        - Reward: Make it satisfying
    - To break bad habits we need to:
        - Cue: Make it invisible
        - Craving: Make it unattractive
        - Response: Make it difficult
        - Reward: Make it unsatisfying
