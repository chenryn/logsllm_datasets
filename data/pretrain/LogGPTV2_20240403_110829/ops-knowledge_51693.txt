Assistant: There are at least a couple ways you could achieve that.

I've seen examples of using iptables with its string/bytes-matching functionality to look for recursive queries coming from outside, and then dropping them. I've a colleague that did that on an authoritative non-recursive server for a number of years and he said it works well.

I've also seen people using something like fail2ban to look at the logs, determine that an evil IP/subnet was doing something undesirable, and let it put in rules to block the client at the firewall.
