auditpol remove

The auditpol remove command removes the per-user audit policy for a specified account or all accounts.
To perform remove operations on the per-user policy, you must have Write or Full Control permissions for that object set in the security descriptor. You can also perform remove operations if you have the Manage auditing and security log (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right allows access that isn't necessary to perform the overall remove operations.
