- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `auditpol remove` command is used to delete the per-user audit policy for a specified account or for all accounts.

**Permissions:**
To perform removal operations on the per-user policy, you must have either Write or Full Control permissions for the object as set in the security descriptor. Additionally, you can perform these operations if you have the "Manage auditing and security log" (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right grants more access than is necessary for the removal operations.

**Syntax:**
```shell
auditpol /remove [/user:<SID|username>] [/allusers] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/user:** Specifies the security identifier (SID) or username of the user for whom the per-user audit policy is to be removed.
- **/allusers:** Removes the per-user audit policy for all users.
- **/? :** Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

1. **Remove the per-user audit policy for a specific user by name:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /remove /user:mikedan
   ```

2. **Remove the per-user audit policy for a specific user by SID:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /remove /user:{S-1-5-21-397123471-12346959}
   ```

3. **Remove the per-user audit policy for all users:**
   ```shell
   auditpol /remove /allusers
   ```

This command allows administrators to manage and maintain the per-user audit policies effectively, ensuring that only necessary policies are in place.
