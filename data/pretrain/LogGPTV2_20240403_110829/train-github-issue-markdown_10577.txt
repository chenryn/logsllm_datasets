When using mysql as URI scheme in caravel_config.py, everything works fine.  
I could add druid cluster. When I try to refresh druid metadata, it throws
following error:
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: This Session's transaction has been rolled
back due to a previous exception during flush. To begin a new transaction with
this Session, first issue Session.rollback(). Original exception was:
(_mysql_exceptions.IntegrityError) (1452, 'Cannot add or update a child row: a
foreign key constraint fails (`caravel`.`columns`, CONSTRAINT `columns_ibfk_1`
FOREIGN KEY (`column_name`) REFERENCES `datasources` (`datasource_name`))')
On debugging, I figured out that while calling sync_to_db, DruidDatasource is
trying to modify DruidColumn which I understand is not allowed.
Could some one help me if I am doing something wrong or is it a valid issue.
OS: Ubuntu 14.04  
Druid: 0.9  
Caravel: 0.9
Steps to reproduce.
  1. Change URI scheme to mysql as instructed in tutorial. Follow tutorial.
  2. Add Druid cluster.
  3. Do Druid Refresh Metadata.
