When I change the selection in a dropdown menu, two-way data binding fails to function properly in Firefox version 44.0.2. However, it works as expected in Chrome. 

For reference, you can see an example of this issue here: [Angular Forms Example](https://angular.io/resources/live-examples/forms/ts/plnkr.html)

Could you please help me resolve this problem?
