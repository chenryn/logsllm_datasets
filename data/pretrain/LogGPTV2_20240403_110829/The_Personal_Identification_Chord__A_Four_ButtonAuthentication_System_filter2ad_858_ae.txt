enter. For example, a PIC consisting of “2+3, 2+3, 1, 2” re-uses
“2+3.” If such selection behaviors are common, an attacker could
try to create rules based on repetitive tap selection patterns, and
perform smarter guessing attacks on PICs. To measure the severity
of such attacks, we counted the number of PICs that consist of a
tap used twice or more (see Table 8). Unexpectedly, all PIC policies,
PIC-free (26.67%), PIC-dual (36.67%), and PIC-dual-rand (30%),
contained smaller percentages of PICs consisting of a repeating
tap compared to PINs (46.67%). We surmise that PICs may be more
robust against rule-based attacks that guess using repeating taps.
To further analyze the patterns of repeated taps in PIC poli-
cies, we classified taps into the categories of single (S) and dual
(D) tap. Table 9 shows the results. There were 16 PIC-free pass-
words (53.33%) including at least 3 consecutively repeating taps
(i.e., DDDD, SSSS, DDDS, DSSS, SSSD and SDDD patterns), which is sub-
stantially greater than the 6 PIC-dual passwords (20%) and the
12 PIC-dual-rand passwords (40%). This implies that PIC-free
users more frequently used the same finger(s) to select taps in their

6 PIC AND PIN SECURITY
This section presents security results for PINs and PICs, including
guessing entropy and per tap or item usage frequencies.
6.1 PIC taps and PIN items used
Biases in PIC tap and PIN item selection could weaken their secu-
rity. To study their security implications, we analyzed the usage
frequencies of each of the ten PIC taps and PIN items. Figure 6
shows the usage ratios of all ten taps and items across the four poli-
cies arranged in descending (usage frequency) order. Overall, the
usage frequencies of the taps used in PIC-free were more evenly
distributed than those in other policies. We also analyzed the usage
frequencies of the start/end taps and items (see Figure 8 and 9 in
Appendix A). Appendix A shows the most frequently used start taps
in PIC-dual and PIC-dual-rand were ‘2+3’ (26.67%) while ‘3’ was
the most frequently used in PIC-free (23.33%). In PIN-original,
‘0’ was the most frequently used item and ‘5’ and ‘6’ have never
been used as a start tap. The usage frequencies of end taps and
items seem evenly distributed except for PIC-dual. The most fre-
quently used end tap in PIC-dual is ‘4’ (26.67%). Interestingly, the
most frequently used end item for PIN-original was ‘0’ which
is same for the case of the start PIN item. To better understand
the characteristics of tap selection in PICs, we also categorized the
PIC taps into four groups and normalized the proportions. They
were: Single = {1, 2, 3, 4}, vertical = {1+3, 2+4}, horizontal = {1+2,
3+4}, and diagonal = {1+4, 2+3}. Usages frequencies are shown in
Table 7. Unexpectedly, the diagonal taps were most popularly used
in all PIC policies (30.21–37.16%). Figure 7 shows the frequency
ratio of each tap group being used in each of the four PIC positions
(indexes). These graphs indicate that diagonal taps are used more
often in the first and second positions for all PIC policies.
6.2 Repeated use of PIN items and PIC taps
One security concern with PICs is that users could repeatedly use
one or two taps to create chords that are easy to remember and

PICs (because switching between ‘S’ and ‘D’ types may require
switching between one- and two-finger inputs).
6.3 Guessing entropy
To compare the robustness of the four policies against guessing
attacks, we calculated partial guessing entropy estimates [3] because
some attackers may only be interested in stealing just a fraction of
an entire password set. This is a popular technique for estimating
the average number of trials needed to successfully guess a fraction
(α) of an entire password set. Because our collected samples of PICs
and PINs only represent a small portion of the theoretically possible
password space, we employed the 2-gram Markov model [23] to
estimate the occurrence likelihood of every possible PIC or PIN.
To cover rare n-gram cases, we used the Laplace smoothing – the
frequency of each n-gram is incremented by one.
For more intuitive comparison of entropy estimates, entropy es-
timates can be represented in “bits of information.” The converted
results are shown in Table 10. Overall, PIC-free showed the highest
partial guessing entropy estimates in bits of information. Contrary
to our expectations, mandating the use of dual-taps (PIC-dual
and PIC-dual-rand) did not increase guessing entropy estimates,
achieving lower entropy estimates compared to PIC-free. There
is a impactful difference between PIC-free and other three poli-
cies. As α increases, the differences between PIN-original and
PIC-free decreases slightly but remains considerable. These re-
sults indicate that PIC-free PICs are more robust against guessing
attacks compared to PINs even when α is large.
6.4 Remembrance techniques
After PIN or PIC setup, the participants were asked about the use of
special techniques to create their PINs (Q3 of Table 2). Remembrance
techniques were widely used, but varied considerably in type – PINs
tended to be numerical and PICs spatial or rhythmic. We grouped
use of special dates (e.g., birthday), student IDs, phone numbers, and
SAT scores into a category of personal information, data that can
be exploited to perform more effective guessing attacks (e.g., [5]).
We analyzed the use of techniques in this category across all
policies revealing that they were significantly more common with
PIN than any PIC policy: 15 out of 30 PIN participants used personal
information to create PINs compared to just 0, 1, and 2 in policies
PIC-free, PIC-dual, and PIC-dual-rand, respectively. These dif-
ferences were all significant (p < 0.05, FET with CI adjustment).
We argue these differences are due to the compound dual-tap labels
(e.g., 1+2 or 2+3) making it difficult for PIC participants to integrate
semantically meaningful numerical content into their PICs. Inher-
ently, PIC’s four buttons prevent use of personal info (e.g. dates,
IDs) in most cases, and we argue this enhances security against
informed guessing attacks using personal information [5].
However, PICs are rich enough to support a range of novel re-
membrance techniques: shapes (e.g., hourglass, symmetrical shape),
tapping rhythms, and ease of transition between touch poses. 9 par-
ticipants of PIC-free, 10 participants of PIC-dual, and 10 partici-
pants of PIC-dual-rand used those techniques in the PIC policies,
respectively.

6.5 2-gram tapping sequence frequencies
To investigate how the PIC remembrance techniques mentioned
above may be exploited to perform guessing attacks on PICs, we
analyzed the frequencies of all possible 2-gram tapping sequences
(see Appendix B). In general, the distribution of 2-gram tapping
sequence probabilities were similar between all four policies. From
PIC-free, the top four frequently used 2-gram sequences were “1,
2,” “3, 2,” “1+2, 1+4,” and “1+3, 2+4” (all with probability of 0.24).
This indicates that the use of a single-tap was often followed by
another single-tap, and the use of a dual-tap was often followed by
another dual-tap. Such characteristics may be exploited to perform
an informed guessing attack but we would need to collect more
PIC data in the future to firmly establish this. In contrast, with
PIC-dual and PIC-dual-rand, we noticed higher probabilities of
2-gram sequences consisting of both single- and dual-tap. As for
PIN-original, “1, 0,” and “8, 1” were the top two frequently used
2-gram sequences. In general, digit “1” was popularly used as the
second digit.
7 DISCUSSION
7.1 PIN performance
PIN performed well in all studies. In the prolonged input tests in the
second study, and in the practice sessions of the third study, perfor-
mance in the shown conditions was rapid and accurate: task times
and error rates of approximately 800ms and 2%. This highlights a
contrast between users’ doubts about their ability to acquire small
targets on watches (as noted in the initial interviews) and their
performance in this task. The low error rates are also striking when
compared with prior studies. Hara [13], for example, reports error
rates of 12.96% with 7mm targets that drop to 2.22% errors with
10mm targets. With the 9.65 × 5.63mm targets in our PIN system,
we expected figures between these values. Possible explanations for
the improved performance in our system are that wide, rectangular
targets may be easier to select than expected, or the customized
touch input system we used increased accuracy. The strong perfor-
mance of shown PIN input was maintained in the third study: it
led to rapid, accurate authentication sessions. Again this data is in
contrast to the lower performance reported in recent work. In more
purely usability focused work, Nyugen and Menon [25] report error
rates in watch PIN authentication to be 7.5%, while Zhao et al. [35]
indicate this may be as high as 11%. These differences highlight
the importance of conducting studies of authentication that closely
match real life use. Both these prior studies use multiple policies per
participant in studies that involve just one session – performance
in these atypical situations may not match performance in more
realistic settings like the single policy multi-day method used in
this paper.
PIN performance in the hidden conditions was split. Both usabil-
ity tests highlight poor accuracy (errors of 8–11%), but these differ-
ences were not maintained in authentication sessions in the third
study. This speaks to the importance of using multiple methods for
evaluating authentication input performance – the prolonged input
sessions and reliable performance data captured by usability stud-
ies can accurately highlight challenging input conditions, but the
impact these variations have on real authentication performance
(i.e., in short, sporadic input sessions) is not clear. However, we
argue that the usability costs of PIN in the hidden conditions, as
observed by the usability studies, will ultimately (over time) impact
its viability in these settings.
7.2 PIC performance
PIC performance in the usability sessions was also good: quick
(overall mean: 910ms) and reasonably accurate (4.8%). Although
prior authors have examined both multiple simultaneous taps [21]
and area-based input [26] on smartwatches, this study is the first
to combine these techniques with a set of inputs requiring a range
of different poses: single finger tap, double finger tap, and finger
flat. The data from this study indicates that participants were able
to switch between those poses with a very limited cost to input
efficiency. PIC performance was also maintained between shown
and hidden conditions: in contrast to the sharp increase in error
rate with PIN, data are almost flat in both studies. High accuracy
with PICs was also maintained in the authentication study: we note
no significant differences in recall rates across the four recall tests.
This data supports the claim that PIC is a reliable technique for
authenticating on smartwatches, and that it may be a particularly
useful approach in GUI-free situations, such as authenticating on
a screen in power saving mode (as in LG’s Knock Code [30]) or
on a watch-face. The participants’ responses to the question about
input difficulty in recall tests also suggest that PICs may be easier
to enter when GUIs are hidden (see Figure 5). We argue this data
indicates that PICs satisfy the second requirement from the initial
interview study: they work well in GUI-free conditions. While this
conclusion may also apply to eyes-free conditions, we acknowledge
that further studies would be required to formally establish this.
PIC led to weaker results in terms of the key usability metric of
setup time – the three policy conditions in the third study logged 23-
45 seconds vs 11 seconds for PIN. While this is likely due to a range
of factors (e.g., novelty effects), this difference may be sufficient
to dissuade users from adopting PIC in practice. Additionally, we
note that PIC entry times were lower than PIN entry times (by up
to 1.47 seconds) in the majority of recall tests, suggesting that PIC
entry may modestly more difficult (e.g., laborious, challenging, or
unfamiliar) than PIN entry. Future work should target reducing PIC
setup and recall times.
7.3 Comparing PIC and PIN security and recall
rate
The third study sought to establish the recall-rate and security of
PICs compared to PINs. The results are positive. Our results failed
to show statistically significant difference in recall rates between
the two schemes. Furthermore, the PIC-free policy outperformed
PINs in terms of guessing entropy, showing that PICs may be more
