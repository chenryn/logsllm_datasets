### Analysis of Personal Identification Chord (PIC) and PIN Security

#### 6.67% Repeated Taps in PICs
In the context of Personal Identification Chords (PICs), a common pattern is the re-use of specific tap combinations, such as "2+3, 2+3, 1, 2." If such repetitive patterns are frequent, attackers could exploit these by creating rules based on the observed tap selection patterns to perform more effective guessing attacks. To assess the severity of such attacks, we analyzed the number of PICs that included at least one tap used twice or more (see Table 8). Surprisingly, all PIC policies—PIC-free (26.67%), PIC-dual (36.67%), and PIC-dual-rand (30%)—had a lower percentage of PICs with repeating taps compared to PINs (46.67%). This suggests that PICs may be more resistant to rule-based attacks that rely on repeated taps.

To further investigate the patterns of repeated taps, we categorized taps into single (S) and dual (D) tap types. The results, presented in Table 9, show that 16 PIC-free passwords (53.33%) included at least three consecutive repeating taps (i.e., DDDD, SSSS, DDDS, DSSS, SSSD, and SDDD patterns). This is significantly higher than the 6 PIC-dual passwords (20%) and the 12 PIC-dual-rand passwords (40%). This indicates that PIC-free users more frequently used the same finger(s) to select taps, which could be a potential vulnerability.

### Security Results for PINs and PICs

#### 6.1 PIC Taps and PIN Items Used
Biases in the selection of PIC taps and PIN items can weaken their security. To analyze these biases, we examined the usage frequencies of each of the ten PIC taps and PIN items. Figure 6 shows the usage ratios of all ten taps and items across the four policies, arranged in descending order of usage frequency. Overall, the usage frequencies of the taps in PIC-free were more evenly distributed compared to other policies. We also analyzed the usage frequencies of the start and end taps and items (see Figures 8 and 9 in Appendix A).

- **Start Taps/Items:**
  - In PIC-dual and PIC-dual-rand, the most frequently used start tap was '2+3' (26.67%).
  - In PIC-free, the most frequently used start tap was '3' (23.33%).
  - In PIN-original, '0' was the most frequently used item, and '5' and '6' were never used as start items.

- **End Taps/Items:**
  - The usage frequencies of end taps and items were generally evenly distributed, except in PIC-dual, where '4' was the most frequently used end tap (26.67%).
  - For PIN-original, '0' was the most frequently used end item, the same as the start item.

To better understand the characteristics of tap selection in PICs, we categorized the PIC taps into four groups and normalized the proportions:
- **Single:** {1, 2, 3, 4}
- **Vertical:** {1+3, 2+4}
- **Horizontal:** {1+2, 3+4}
- **Diagonal:** {1+4, 2+3}

The usage frequencies are shown in Table 7. Diagonal taps were the most popularly used in all PIC policies (30.21–37.16%). Figure 7 illustrates the frequency ratio of each tap group being used in each of the four PIC positions (indexes), indicating that diagonal taps are more frequently used in the first and second positions across all PIC policies.

#### 6.2 Repeated Use of PIN Items and PIC Taps
A security concern with PICs is that users might repeatedly use one or two taps to create chords that are easy to remember but potentially vulnerable to guessing attacks. To address this, we compared the bits of information with α across all policies (Table 10). PIC-free showed the highest partial guessing entropy estimates in bits of information, contrary to our expectations. Mandating the use of dual-taps (PIC-dual and PIC-dual-rand) did not increase guessing entropy estimates, achieving lower entropy estimates compared to PIC-free. As α increases, the differences between PIN-original and PIC-free decrease slightly but remain significant, indicating that PIC-free PICs are more robust against guessing attacks compared to PINs even when α is large.

#### 6.3 Guessing Entropy
To compare the robustness of the four policies against guessing attacks, we calculated partial guessing entropy estimates using a 2-gram Markov model [23] and Laplace smoothing. The results, shown in Table 10, indicate that PIC-free had the highest partial guessing entropy estimates in bits of information. Mandating the use of dual-taps (PIC-dual and PIC-dual-rand) did not increase guessing entropy estimates, achieving lower entropy estimates compared to PIC-free. As α increases, the differences between PIN-original and PIC-free decrease slightly but remain considerable, suggesting that PIC-free PICs are more robust against guessing attacks compared to PINs even when α is large.

#### 6.4 Remembrance Techniques
After setting up their PIN or PIC, participants were asked about the use of special techniques to create their codes. Remembrance techniques varied, with PINs tending to be numerical and PICs spatial or rhythmic. We grouped the use of special dates, student IDs, phone numbers, and SAT scores into a category of personal information, which can be exploited for guessing attacks. Our analysis revealed that the use of personal information was significantly more common with PINs (15 out of 30 participants) compared to PIC policies (0, 1, and 2 for PIC-free, PIC-dual, and PIC-dual-rand, respectively). These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05, FET with CI adjustment). We argue that the compound dual-tap labels in PICs make it difficult to integrate semantically meaningful numerical content, enhancing security against informed guessing attacks. However, PICs support novel remembrance techniques such as shapes, tapping rhythms, and ease of transition between touch poses.

#### 6.5 2-gram Tapping Sequence Frequencies
To investigate how remembrance techniques might be exploited for guessing attacks, we analyzed the frequencies of all possible 2-gram tapping sequences (see Appendix B). The distribution of 2-gram tapping sequence probabilities was similar across all four policies. In PIC-free, the top four frequently used 2-gram sequences were “1, 2,” “3, 2,” “1+2, 1+4,” and “1+3, 2+4” (all with a probability of 0.24). This indicates that single-taps were often followed by another single-tap, and dual-taps were often followed by another dual-tap. Such patterns could be exploited for informed guessing attacks. In contrast, PIC-dual and PIC-dual-rand showed higher probabilities of 2-gram sequences consisting of both single- and dual-taps. For PIN-original, the top two frequently used 2-gram sequences were “1, 0” and “8, 1,” with digit “1” being popularly used as the second digit.

### Discussion

#### 7.1 PIN Performance
PINs performed well in all studies. In the prolonged input tests and practice sessions, task times and error rates were approximately 800ms and 2%, respectively. This contrasts with users' initial doubts about acquiring small targets on watches. Possible explanations for the improved performance include the ease of selecting wide, rectangular targets and the customized touch input system. The strong performance of PIN input was maintained in the third study, leading to rapid and accurate authentication sessions. However, PIN performance in hidden conditions was poor, with errors ranging from 8% to 11%. This highlights the importance of using multiple methods for evaluating authentication input performance, as real-world performance may differ from controlled settings.

#### 7.2 PIC Performance
PIC performance in usability sessions was also good, with an overall mean of 910ms and an accuracy rate of 4.8%. This study combined multiple simultaneous taps and area-based input with a range of different poses, and participants were able to switch between these poses with minimal impact on input efficiency. PIC performance was consistent between shown and hidden conditions, maintaining high accuracy in the authentication study. This supports the claim that PICs are reliable for smartwatch authentication, especially in GUI-free situations. Participants also reported that PICs were easier to enter when GUIs were hidden (see Figure 5).

However, PICs had longer setup times (23-45 seconds) compared to PINs (11 seconds). While this difference may be due to novelty effects, it could dissuade users from adopting PICs. Additionally, PIC entry times were lower than PIN entry times in most recall tests, suggesting that PIC entry may be more challenging. Future work should focus on reducing PIC setup and recall times.

#### 7.3 Comparing PIC and PIN Security and Recall Rate
The third study aimed to establish the recall rate and security of PICs compared to PINs. The results were positive, showing no statistically significant difference in recall rates between the two schemes. Furthermore, the PIC-free policy outperformed PINs in terms of guessing entropy, indicating that PICs may be more secure.
