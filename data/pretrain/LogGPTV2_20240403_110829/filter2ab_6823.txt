title:blackhat:us-22 Leveraging the Apple ESF for Behavioral Detections
Since its 2019 introduction in macOS Catalina, we have used the Apple Endpoint Security Framework (ESF) as an event source to fuel behavioral-based detections. In this talk, we will focus on the difference between the old and new ways of detecting malicious activity on macOS, speaking to why both are relevant today. We will break down how we use ESF data, both in its basic form, as well as a pivot point to perform more advanced detections. The Endpoint Security Framework provides many different fields that get overlooked in detection scenarios. We will show how we can use these clues to piece together a story about malicious activity that has taken place on a system. Finally, we will discuss examples where ESF has helped us identify that exploitation has taken place, including the detection of multiple 0-days.
