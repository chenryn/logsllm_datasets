User: I have a script on my machine that I want to start running as the machine boots and will attempt run again should it crash or otherwise fail.
Would this mean turing it into a service?  I realise I could use the crontab and use @reboot, but that doesn't fix the issue should the script crash
Assistant: I would start it using init and monitor at interval with a seperate script using crontab watching for a PID file it creates.
Alternatively, if you can find the PID ID using your crontab script (using ps) and re-init the script if it doesn't exist.
My 2 Cents..
