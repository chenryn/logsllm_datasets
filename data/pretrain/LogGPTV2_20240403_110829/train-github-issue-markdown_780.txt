Every node on GCE by default has cAdvisor, fluentd-es running as pod. We are
going to put etcd server into a pod soon, and other master components into
pods later. Those pods are pre-provisioned, and not through apiserver, and
scheduler, I called them "static" pods.
Today, kubelet does generate events related to those static pods, and push
them to etcd. But there is no way to query those pods config from clients, and
static pods in crashloop cannot be detected easily because apiserver doesn't
aware of them.
Also those pods do consume resources, and without awareness of static pods on
a node, scheduler might overcommit a node easily.
We should have a mechanism defined for kubelet to sync back to master with
those static Pods.
