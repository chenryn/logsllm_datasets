DIY Nukeproofing: Outline
● Why technologies like SILEX / AVLIS / MLIS 
are democratizing nuclear proliferation (FUD)
● Identifying risk and requirements to mitigate it
● Getting “shovel-ready”
● Taking “data-mining” very literally
Atomic Dominoes: Baryons to Bombs
● Neutron discovered in 1932
● Fissile nuclei split when hit!
● ...and give off more neutrons
         such radiation
                                                    much explosion
very fission product
                                          wow
Pitchblende and the Manhattan 
Project
● Fissile material is not naturally occurring
● ...but pitchblende is, with up to 20% U
● Enter $26B of inflation-adjusted defense
research and development during World War II
Separation Anxiety
● Mining and refining proved to be easy (sort of)
● ...enrichment, not so much.
● 13,300,000kg of Silver and
nothing to show for it
Centrifuges proved practical...
● Sort of, aside from needing 1,000s
rotating near the speed of sound
● Has remained defacto standard for enrichment
It had some wicked deliverables...
● Plutonium implosion-type
● “Fat Man” 21kt, 14lbs Pu
● Uranium gun-type
● “Little Boy” 13kt 140lbs U
Little Boy's closest survivors...
● Eizo Nomura at 170m from ground zero in the 
basement of the Hiroshima Prefecture Fuel 
Rationing Union
● Akiko Takakura at 300m from ground zero in 
Bank of Hiroshima's Vault
Heating up the Cold War
● Teller-Ulam devices making use of tritium
● Yields as high as 50MT (USSR)
● Lots of centrifuges spinning 24/7
● Ultimately we find a Nash Equilibrium...
● tl;dr MAD for Superpowers, why aren't all dead
● A whole lot of “hot” glass caverns left at the 
Nevada Test Site, data on blast protection
Loose Nukes
● Old bomb cores remain unaccounted for/lost
● Most thefts have been by small time criminals
● No recorded instances in bomb-size quantity
● Successfully smuggling strategy limited to 
submarines, tunnels, low flying drones
● Proliferation has thus far eluded non-state actors 
Asymmetric Warfare: The Mouse 
That Roared
● Best Korea's Nuclear Necrocracy
● Skirting the lines of a “nation state”
● The smallest known nuclear program to date
● Kim Jong-Un's battle with Uric Acid
● ...poster-child of 21st century proliferation, 
“trickling down” to non-state actors
Laser Isotope Separation
● Ongoing clandestine development
(AVLIS / MLIS / SILEX)
● Increasingly efficient processes
● Extremely compact by comparison
● Depreciates centrifuges
● Greatly reduces barrier of entry to proliferation
● Threat mounts with laser diode development
Systematic Decomposition of 
NUDET Protection
● Broad-spectrum radiation
● Blast over-pressure
● Seismic shock
● Fallout, decay products
● Secondary radioactivity
● Widespread conflagration
● Potential civil unrest
The Mineshaft Gap
● The solution is below your feet... or can be
● Civilian bunkers – newly popular in the '50s
● Switzerland – bunkers mandatory since '63
● Interest waned with stockpile reductions
● Resurgence after 9/11
Location, Location, Location
● Estimate nearby hazards/targets
● Use NukeMap for blast and radiation data
● Above the water table and/or in an aquiclude
● Avoid loose rock, sand, flood prone areas, etc
● Hard rock increases complexity, protection
● Clays offer high strength and plasticity 
Determine Project Scope
● Primarily limited by time and money
● Yes you can copy Cheyenne Mountain...
● ...but not cheaply or quickly
● For exercise and a hobby, keep it manual
● For speed, keep it under 2,000 ft3 (56m3)
● You can always go deeper...
Soil Stability
● “I like my soil how I like my women, type A”
● 4:1 benching without support
● Trench and tunnel support minimized
● Much easier to excavate than hard rock
● OSHA's “thumb test”
● Extreme care must be taken near karst, in sand
Don't forget to call 811
● Hitting a buried gas line will probably kill you
● Vacuum excavation for exposing utilities
Diggin', dig it up!
● Preferred excavation method varies
● Cut and cover is easier, compromises rock
● Shaft & Adit / Trench & Tunnel confined areas
● “Sortie rate” limits excavation, except hard rock
● Operating gas/diesel equipment underground
Excavation methods
● Think of it like a small mining operation
● Optimize Loading, Hauling, Dumping phases
● Type B&C soil require continuous support
● Fracturing type A soil: mattock, rotary hammer
● Fracturing soft rock: jackhammer
● Fracturing hard rock: hydraulic breaker 
hammer, blasting
Haulage
● In confined spaces, consider 5 gal buckets
● Wheelbarrows work well on shallow grades, 
can be winched uphill or vertically (headframe)
● Mini-loaders like the Toro Dingo fairly well work 
in long trenches with a shallow slope
● Continuous haulage systems are expensive
Headframes on Shafts
● Primarily used for mine shafts
● Well suited to replace a rental crane
● Ideal for operations with a small footprint
● Expect $400 total for ~500kg capacity DIY
● Ends up being the “limiting reagent” in sortie rate
Taking a Dump
● Disposing of spoil is usually expensive
● You can use craigslist and give it away
● Filling in nearby low lying areas is easier
● Keep in mind overall “sortie rate” in terms of 
tonnage efficiency
Temporary Support Systems
● Spot shoring is sufficient in hard soil/soft rock
● Large cracks and kettlebells are extremely 
dangerous, cracked dikes can be unstable
● On a small scale, wood falsework is practical
● Leveling jacks and schedule 40 pipe are great
● Remaining alert to ground deformation is critical
Permanent Support
● Glass fiber reinforced concrete
● 4” rebar spacing is ideal for NUDET protection
● Egg-shaped tunnels most collapse resistant
● Worst case scenario involves bedrock fracture
● Waterproofing is required below the water table!
Ventilation
● Breathing silicates will cause silicosis
● P100 respirator offers protection, taxing
● Wetting dust is an option, issues with humidity
● Tethered SCBAs are very effective
● If operating an engine, large blowers required
● Tape and LDPE sheeting is cheaper than ducts
Utilities
● Keeping a server online underground is easier
● Cooling generally not an issue in small scale
● Best to run waterproof conduit
● Battery operated sump pump for dewatering
● No substitute for a trash pump in a flood
