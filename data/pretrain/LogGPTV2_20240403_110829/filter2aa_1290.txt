## Outline
- **Why Technologies Like SILEX, AVLIS, and MLIS Are Democratizing Nuclear Proliferation (FUD)**
- **Identifying Risks and Requirements to Mitigate Them**
- **Getting “Shovel-Ready”**
- **Taking “Data-Mining” Very Literally**

## Atomic Dominoes: From Baryons to Bombs
- **Neutron Discovery in 1932**: The discovery of the neutron led to the understanding that fissile nuclei can split when struck by neutrons.
- **Fission Process**: When a fissile nucleus splits, it releases more neutrons, leading to a chain reaction and significant energy release.

## Pitchblende and the Manhattan Project
- **Fissile Material**: Fissile material is not naturally occurring, but pitchblende, which contains up to 20% uranium, is.
- **Manhattan Project**: During World War II, $26 billion (inflation-adjusted) was invested in defense research and development to enrich uranium and create nuclear weapons.

## Separation Anxiety
- **Mining and Refining**: These processes were relatively straightforward, but enrichment proved to be much more challenging.
- **Silver Enrichment Failure**: Despite using 13,300,000 kg of silver, no significant progress was made.
- **Centrifuges**: Centrifuges became the practical method for enrichment, requiring thousands of them to rotate near the speed of sound.

## Deliverables from the Manhattan Project
- **Plutonium Implosion-Type**: The "Fat Man" bomb, with a yield of 21 kilotons and 14 pounds of plutonium.
- **Uranium Gun-Type**: The "Little Boy" bomb, with a yield of 13 kilotons and 140 pounds of uranium.

## Survivors of the Hiroshima Bombing
- **Eizo Nomura**: Survived at 170 meters from ground zero in the basement of the Hiroshima Prefecture Fuel Rationing Union.
- **Akiko Takakura**: Survived at 300 meters from ground zero in the Bank of Hiroshima's vault.

## The Cold War and Nuclear Deterrence
- **Teller-Ulam Devices**: Utilized tritium and achieved yields as high as 50 megatons (USSR).
- **Nash Equilibrium**: The concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) maintained a balance of power.
- **Nevada Test Site**: Many "hot" glass caverns remain, providing data on blast protection.

## Loose Nukes
- **Unaccounted Bomb Cores**: Some old bomb cores remain unaccounted for or lost.
- **Thefts**: Most thefts have been by small-time criminals, with no recorded instances of bomb-size quantities.
- **Smuggling Strategies**: Successful smuggling has been limited to submarines, tunnels, and low-flying drones.
- **Non-State Actors**: Proliferation has so far eluded non-state actors.

## Asymmetric Warfare: The Mouse That Roared
- **North Korea's Nuclear Program**: North Korea, despite its small size, has developed a nuclear program, becoming a poster-child for 21st-century proliferation.
- **Kim Jong-Un's Health Issues**: His battle with uric acid highlights the challenges of maintaining such a program.

## Laser Isotope Separation
- **Ongoing Development**: Technologies like AVLIS, MLIS, and SILEX are being clandestinely developed.
- **Efficiency and Compactness**: These methods are increasingly efficient and compact, reducing the barrier to entry for nuclear proliferation.
- **Threats**: The development of laser diodes further exacerbates these threats.

## Systematic Decomposition of NUDET Protection
- **Radiation and Blast Over-Pressure**: Broad-spectrum radiation and blast over-pressure are primary concerns.
- **Seismic Shock and Fallout**: Seismic shock and fallout, including decay products and secondary radioactivity, also pose significant risks.
- **Conflagration and Civil Unrest**: Widespread fires and potential civil unrest must be considered.

## The Mineshaft Gap
- **Underground Solutions**: Civilian bunkers, popular in the 1950s, and mandatory in Switzerland since 1963, offer protection.
- **Resurgence**: Interest in bunkers resurged after 9/11, following a decline with stockpile reductions.

## Location, Location, Location
- **Hazard Estimation**: Use tools like NukeMap to estimate nearby hazards and targets.
- **Geological Considerations**: Choose locations above the water table, avoiding loose rock, sand, and flood-prone areas.
- **Rock Types**: Hard rock increases complexity and protection, while clays offer high strength and plasticity.

## Determine Project Scope
- **Time and Money**: Projects are primarily limited by time and money.
- **Cheyenne Mountain**: While replicating Cheyenne Mountain is possible, it is neither cheap nor quick.
- **Manual and Small-Scale Projects**: For hobbies and exercises, keep projects manual and under 2,000 cubic feet (56 cubic meters).

## Soil Stability
- **Soil Types**: Type A soil is preferred, allowing for 4:1 benching without support.
- **Excavation**: Trench and tunnel support should be minimized, and extreme care must be taken near karst and in sandy areas.
- **OSHA Guidelines**: Follow OSHA’s “thumb test” for soil stability.

## Call 811 Before You Dig
- **Utility Safety**: Hitting a buried gas line can be fatal. Use vacuum excavation to expose utilities safely.

## Excavation Methods
- **Cut and Cover**: Easier but compromises rock integrity.
- **Shaft & Adit / Trench & Tunnel**: Suitable for confined areas.
- **Sortie Rate**: Limits excavation, especially in hard rock.
- **Equipment**: Operating gas/diesel equipment underground requires caution.

## Haulage
- **Confined Spaces**: Use 5-gallon buckets for confined spaces.
- **Wheelbarrows and Mini-Loaders**: Wheelbarrows work well on shallow grades, and mini-loaders like the Toro Dingo are effective in long trenches.
- **Continuous Haulage Systems**: These systems are expensive but efficient.

## Headframes on Shafts
- **Mine Shaft Applications**: Primarily used for mine shafts and can replace rental cranes.
- **DIY Options**: A DIY headframe with a 500 kg capacity can be built for around $400.
- **Sortie Rate Limitation**: The headframe often becomes the limiting factor in sortie rate.

## Spoil Disposal
- **Cost and Alternatives**: Disposing of spoil is usually expensive, but you can use Craigslist to give it away or fill in nearby low-lying areas.
- **Tonnage Efficiency**: Keep overall tonnage efficiency in mind.

## Temporary Support Systems
- **Spot Shoring**: Sufficient in hard soil and soft rock.
- **Large Cracks and Kettlebells**: Extremely dangerous, requiring careful attention.
- **Wood Falsework**: Practical for small-scale projects.
- **Ground Deformation**: Remaining alert to ground deformation is critical.

## Permanent Support
- **Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete**: Ideal for NUDET protection.
- **Rebar Spacing**: 4-inch rebar spacing is optimal.
- **Tunnel Design**: Egg-shaped tunnels are the most collapse-resistant.
- **Waterproofing**: Essential below the water table.

## Ventilation
- **Silicosis Risk**: Breathing silicates can cause silicosis.
- **Respirators and Dust Control**: P100 respirators, wetting dust, and tethered SCBAs are effective.
- **Blowers**: Large blowers are required if operating an engine.
- **Ducting Alternatives**: Tape and LDPE sheeting are cheaper than ducts.

## Utilities
- **Server Operation**: Keeping a server online underground is easier.
- **Cooling**: Generally not an issue in small-scale projects.
- **Conduit and Pumps**: Waterproof conduit and battery-operated sump pumps are recommended. Trash pumps are essential in floods.
