I have to admit that I don't understand the formal properties of the type
system well enough to tell whether this could cause trouble, and also not
clear whether this could be done in a 1.x release at all. With those caveats:
The current behavior, that any subtype check with `Union{}` on the left hand
side will return `true` (no matter what) was surprising to me and makes it
kind of cumbersome to write code that really does what at least I want it to
do when I'm checking for a subtype relationship. I've always assumed that if I
write say `T <: AbstractString`, that I really only can get a `true` if `T` is
some sort of string, but it turns out that if I want that behavior I need to
write `T <: AbstractString && T !== Union{}`.
This came up in queryverse/TableTraits.jl#21.
