This  workshop  will  continue  the  initiative,  which  started  four  years  ago,  of  bringing  together  the  international 
communities of dependability and software architectures. The first workshop on Architecting Dependable Systems 
was  organised  during  the  International  Conference  on  Software  Engineering  2002  (ICSE),  and  since  then  five 
workshops  were  organised  and  three  books  were  published  (http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/wads).  This  activity  has 
culminated in 2004 with the organisation of the Twin Workshops that were held at ICSE 2004 and DSN 2004. This 
series of workshops have shown to be a fertile ground for both communities for clarifying approaches that have been 
previously tried and succeeded, as well as those that have been tried but have not yet shown to be successful. This 
not only helps avoid the reinvention of the wheel, but also clarifies and promotes areas where the most promising 
research may lie.  
The  program  of  the  workshop  will  promote  the  discussion  in  the  area  of  architecting  dependable  systems  by 
focusing  on  two  basic  questions:  what  are  the  architectural  principles  involved  in  building  dependable  systems? 
How should these architectures be evaluated? 
Objectives and Topics. The aim of the workshop is to bring together the communities of software architectures and 
dependability to discuss the state of research and practice when dealing with dependability issues at the architecture 
level.  We  are  interested  in  submissions  from  both  industry  and  academia  on  all  topics  related  to  software 
architectures for dependable systems. These include, but are not limited to:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
dependability modeling in software architectures;  
verification and validation (including model checking) of dependable software architectures;  
adaptable architectures for achieving dependability;  
architectural support for self-healing, self-repairing, self-stabilizing systems;  
run-time checks of architectural models;  
dependability evaluation in software architectures;  
architectural patterns for dependable systems;  
exception handling in software architectures;  
redundancy and diversity at the level of architectures;  
dependable architectures and implementation.
