ABSTRACT
A random beacon provides a continuous public source of ran-
domness and its applications range from public lotteries to zero-
knowledge proofs. Existing random beacon protocols sacrifice ei-
ther the fault tolerance or the communication complexity for se-
curity, or ease of reconfigurability. This work overcomes the chal-
lenges with the existing works through a novel communication
efficient combination of state machine replication and (Publicly)
Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS/VSS).
For a system with 𝑛 nodes in the synchronous communication
model and a security parameter 𝜅, we first design an optimally
resilient Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication protocol
with 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) bits communication per consensus decision without
using threshold signatures. Next, we design GRandPiper (Good
Pipelined Random beacon), a random beacon protocol with bias-
resistance and unpredictability, that uses PVSS and has a communi-
cation complexity of 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) always, for a static adversary. However,
GRandPiper allows an adaptive adversary to predict beacon values
up to 𝑡 + 1 epochs into the future. Therefore, we design BRandPiper
(Better RandPiper), that uses VSS and has a communication com-
plexity of 𝑂(𝜅 𝑓 𝑛2), where 𝑓 is the actual number of faults, while
offering a strong unpredictability with an advantage of only a single
round even for an adaptive adversary. We also provide reconfigura-
tion mechanisms to restore the resilience of the beacon protocols
while still maintaining quadratic communication complexity per
epoch. We implement BRandPiper and compare it against the state-
of-the-art practically deployed beacon protocol, Drand, and show
that we are always better than or equal to it in performance.

1 INTRODUCTION
Public digital randomness is essential across a large spectrum of
security applications ranging from e-voting to blockchains. Its prac-
tical relevance is further evident from NIST’s Randomness Beacons
project [21] and from the recent emergence of Drand Organiza-
tion [25]. In addition, several other proposals [16, 20, 24, 29, 30,
43, 44, 47] and implementations [18, 28, 39] offer random beacons
protocols [40].
A random beacon protocol emits a new random value at inter-
mittent intervals such that the emitted values are bias-resistant,
i.e., no entity can influence a future random beacon value, and un-
predictable, i.e., no entity can predict future beacon value. Clearly,
we cannot trust a single node to offer such a service — the node
can easily affect both bias-resistance and unpredictability of the
beacon. A series of recent works have instead relied on distributing
the trust across multiple nodes such that even if a subset of nodes
gets compromised, the beacon is still secure [16, 30, 44, 47].
In a system consisting of 𝑛 nodes, tolerating 𝑡 Byzantine faults,
with security parameter 𝜅, an ideal distributed randomness bea-
con protocol, in addition to being bias-resistant and unpredictable,
should have the following properties: (i) optimal resilience, (ii) low
communication overhead, (iii) reconfiguration friendliness (allow-
ing efficient addition and removal of nodes), and (iv) use efficient
cryptographic schemes as opposed to computationally expensive
schemes such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Verifiable Delay Func-
tions (VDFs). Existing works trade one or the other of the above fea-
tures expected from a random beacon. For instance, HydRand [44]
sacrifices optimal resilience (𝑡 < 𝑛/3) for better communication
complexity (𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) in the best case and 𝑂(𝜅𝑛3) in the worst case)
with minimal setup assumptions. Cachin et al. [16] provide a pro-
tocol with communication complexity of 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2), but it requires

configuration of the system without changing the threshold setup
through proactive secret (re-)sharing techniques. Several other so-
lutions [24, 43] use computationally expensive mechanisms such
as VDFs1 [12] where nodes compute VDF function constantly to
ensure security of the beacon.
In this work2, we ask whether we can design an optimally re-
silient random beacon protocol that achieves good communica-
tion complexity while using efficient cryptographic schemes and
a re-usable setup, i.e., avoiding setups such as those of threshold
signatures where the entire setup needs to be re-generated when
a participating node is replaced. To answer this question, we first
design an optimally resilient Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state
machine replication (SMR) protocol with 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) communication
complexity per consensus decision while requiring a structured
reference string (SRS) [34] setup that allows any bounded reconfigu-
ration. Next, we present two random beacon protocols GRandPiper
(Good Pipelined Random beacon) and BRandPiper (Better Pipelined
Random beacon) using our BFT SMR protocol as a building block
and provide similar guarantees. GRandPiper is communication ef-
ficient (𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) in the best and worst case) but allows an adaptive
adversary to predict 𝑡 + 1 epochs into the future. BRandPiper offers
stronger unpredictability guarantees, but has a communication com-
plexity of 𝑂(𝜅 𝑓 𝑛2) where 𝑓 is the actual number of faults. Finally,
we present a communication efficient reconfiguration protocol to
add nodes to the system while maintaining quadratic communica-
tion complexity per round.
1.1 Efficient State Machine Replication Without
Threshold Signatures
There has been a long sequence of work in improving communi-
cation complexity of consensus protocols [1, 4, 14, 26, 33, 35, 49].
In the synchronous SMR setting, the optimal communication com-
plexity per consensus decision of an SMR protocol is 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) bits [1,
3, 35, 46]. However, all of these solutions use threshold signatures.
Our first result improves upon the communication complexity in
the absence of threshold signatures. Specifically, we show the fol-
lowing:
Theorem 1.1. Assuming public-key infrastructure and a univer-
sal structured reference string setup under 𝑞-SDH assumption, there
exists a state machine replication protocol with amortized 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2)
communication complexity per consensus decision tolerating 𝑡 < 𝑛/2
Byzantine faults.
To be precise, the protocol incurs 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) communication com-
plexity under 𝑞-strong Diffie-Hellman (SDH) assumption [13] (Can
be generated using distributed protocols) or 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2 log 𝑛) without
it. Getting rid of threshold signatures allows for efficient reconfigu-
ration of the participating nodes and does not require generating
threshold keys each time a new node joins the system. It is in this
sense that our system is reconfiguration-friendly. Thus, an efficient
BFT protocol in this setting is also of independent interest. We re-
duce communication by making use of efficient erasure coding [41]
and cryptographic accumulators [8] to efficiently broadcast large
messages at the expense of increase in latency of SMR protocol.
As we will see, the increase in latency does not affect our random
beacon protocols adversely.
1.2 RandPiper – Random Beacon Protocols
RandPiper is a suite of random beacon protocols that use our SMR
protocol as a building block. We present two protocols: GRand-
Piper (Good Pipelined Random beacon) and BRandPiper (Better
Pipelined Random beacon) which differ in unpredictability and
communication complexity. In both protocols, we use secret shar-
ing schemes to privately commit random numbers ahead of time.
This ensures bias-resistance as the random number once shared
cannot be changed. For unpredictability, we ensure that the beacon
outputs are generated using inputs from 𝑡 + 1 nodes (where 𝑡 is the
threshold of Byzantine nodes) at least one of which is truly random,
and therefore the output is truly random.
GRandPiper. In GRandPiper, we explore how to build a communi-
cation optimal random beacon protocol with bias-resistance and
strong unpredictability, i.e., allowing a static adversary to predict
up to a security parameter number of epochs into the future. In
particular, we show the following:
Theorem 1.2 (Informal). Assuming public-key infrastructure
and a universal structured reference string setup under 𝑞-SDH as-
sumption, there exists a reconfiguration friendly, bias-resistant, and
𝑂(min(𝜅, 𝑡))-absolute unpredictable (see Definition 2.2) random bea-
con protocol tolerating 𝑡 < 𝑛/2 Byzantine faults with 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) com-
munication per beacon output.
Our GRandPiper protocol outputs a random beacon with 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2)
communication complexity per beacon output, where 𝜅 is the secu-
rity parameter. The output of the beacon protocol is bias-resistant
and satisfies strong unpredictability against a static adversary, i.e.,
the probability of a static adversary predicting 𝑐 rounds into the fu-
ture is less than 2−𝑐 (in expectation this is 2 rounds into the future).
For cases when 𝜅 is smaller than 𝑡, waiting 𝜅 rounds is sufficient.
After 𝑡 + 1 epochs, an adversary can never predict beacons into the
future except with negligible probability. We concisely term this
as 𝑂(min(𝜅, 𝑡))-absolute unpredictable protocol. We also do not
need any threshold setups, which allows nodes to join and leave
the system easily without stopping our protocol.
At a high-level, our protocol uses Publicly Verifiable Secret Shar-
ing (PVSS) schemes, and allows a leader to input an 𝑂(𝜅𝑛)-sized
PVSS encryptions PVSS.(cid:174)𝐸 into the SMR to share a single secret per
epoch. This secret will be reconstructed when the same node is
chosen as the leader again. To ensure that eventually there is an
honest leader, a leader does not repeat for the next 𝑡 epochs. This
also ensures that our BFT SMR protocol decides on the proposed
shares once we get an honest leader. Our construction ensures that
we always have a communication complexity of 𝑂(𝜅𝑛2) for the
beacon, as the beacon keeps outputting values based on buffered
PVSS shares, and we remove Byzantine nodes to avoid the buffer
from ever being empty.
However, an adaptive adversary can predict3 𝑡 + 1 epochs into
