I'm from the moment.js (http://github.com/moment) team, and some of our users
that are also your users voice concerns that because of the way webpack is
implemented all moment locale files (currently 104) are bundled together, and
that increases the size of what is downloaded to the browser.
Recently there was a suggested "fix" in the moment code (moment/moment#3344),
but then we figured it broke the require mechanism for other environments.
Also we happen to have no instructions on how to use moment and webpack (like
here: http://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/).
Can you please give us a hand by saying what is the right way to use moment
with webpack, so it won't include all locale files if the user wants so. I
hope this will decrease number of issues sent to both projects :)
Note: A webpack user suggested the following: moment/moment#1435 (comment) but
nobody has documented it yet: moment/momentjs.com#269
