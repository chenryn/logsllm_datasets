### 4.2.1 Last-Hop Delay and Jitter in Cable and DSL Networks

#### Figure 10: Last-Hop Delay and Jitter in Cable and DSL Networks
- **Observations**:
  - **DSL Networks**: Show higher last-hop Round-Trip Time (RTT) compared to cable networks. Specifically, 75% of DSL hosts have last-hop delays greater than 10 ms, and 15% have delays exceeding 20 ms.
  - **Cable Networks**: Exhibit lower last-hop RTTs but higher jitter.
  - **Jitter Calculation**: The jitter was estimated by subtracting the 10th percentile RTT from the 90th percentile RTT using small-TCP trickle measurements.

#### Analysis
- **Propagation Delays**: The high propagation delays in DSL networks are surprising, given that many last-hop routers are located in the same city as their end hosts.
- **Jitter Differences**: The higher jitter in cable networks is attributed to the characteristics of upstream cable links, which we will examine further.

### 4.2.2 Transmission Delays in Cable and DSL Networks

#### Transmission Delay
- **Definition**: The time elapsed between a router starting to transmit a packet and ending its transmission. It is typically calculated by dividing the packet length by the link bandwidth.
- **Cable Links**: Use a reservation policy for upstream transmission, which can introduce additional delays.

#### Low Network Load
- **Experiment**: We used large-ICMP trickle to measure last-hop delays and compared them with small-packet delays.
- **Results**:
  - **DSL Networks**: Transmission delays are significant, on the same order of magnitude as propagation delays.
  - **Cable Networks**: Transmission delays are surprisingly low, with 99% of hosts showing an increase of less than 1 ms to send an extra 1,388 bytes.
- **Explanation**: The time-slotted nature of cable links ensures that both large and small packets experience similar waiting times for a time slot. Once a slot is granted, packets are transmitted at full link speed (10.24 Mbps according to DOCSIS 1.0 specification).

#### High Network Load
- **Experiment**: Used small-TCP flood to saturate the upstream link with a large number of small packets.
- **Results**:
  - **DSL Networks**: Show minimal burst sizes.
  - **Cable Networks**: Can concatenate up to 19 or more packets in a single burst.
- **Concatenation Jitter**: Estimated by using the link’s speed and the number of packets in a burst. The mean concatenation jitter for cable networks is about 5 ms, with some links experiencing 10 ms or more of jitter.
- **Impact**: High jitter in cable networks can cause protocols like TCP Vegas and PCP to enter congestion avoidance too early, leading to poor performance.

### 4.2.3 Broadband Queueing Delays

#### Queue Lengths
- **Common Rule of Thumb**: Router queues’ lengths should be equal to the RTT of an average flow through the link.
- **Measurement Method**:
  - **Downstream Queues**: Calculated the difference between the minimum RTT and the 95th percentile highest RTT using large-TCP flood probe trains.
  - **Upstream Queues**: Measured the difference between the minimum RTT and the 95th percentile highest RTTs of large-ICMP flood probe trains, then subtracted the downstream queue length estimate.

#### Results
- **Figures 13(a) and 13(b)**: Cumulative distributions of downstream queue lengths for different cable and DSL providers. Most cable ISPs and two DSL ISPs (PacBell and SWBell) show a sharp rise at 130 ms, consistent with ITU G.114 standard for maximum end-to-end latency (150 ms).
- **Figures 13(c) and 13(d)**: Cumulative distributions of upstream queue lengths. Upstream queues are very large, with most DSL links exhibiting queues of 600 ms or higher, and many cable links allowing queues to grow to several seconds.

### 4.3 Packet Loss in Residential Broadband Networks

#### Observations
- **Loss Rates**: Both DSL and cable paths show similar loss rates, with 95% of all hosts having loss rates of less than 1%.
- **Diurnal Variations**: Loss rates are generally low but show heavy diurnal variations with intermittent spikes.

#### Impact
- **Interactive Traffic**: Excessive upstream queue lengths can negatively affect interactive traffic like VoIP, especially when users upload content using BitTorrent.

This section provides a detailed analysis of the last-hop delay, jitter, transmission delays, and queueing delays in residential broadband networks, highlighting the differences between cable and DSL technologies and their implications for network performance.
