User: How to design a high-availability system architecture to ensure that the system does not interrupt services?
Assistant: Designing a high-availability system architecture requires consideration of many aspects. The following are some main design principles: 1. Remote disaster recovery: deploy the system in different geographical locations to ensure that even if a certain area fails, other areas can still provide normal services. 2. Load balancing: Through load balancing technology, traffic is distributed to multiple servers to avoid service unavailability due to overload or downtime of a certain server. 3. Data backup and recovery: regularly back up important data to avoid system unavailability due to data loss or damage. At the same time, the ability to quickly restore data is required. 4. Front-end monitoring and processing: To detect and handle system abnormalities in time, monitoring tools can be used to realize real-time monitoring of the interactive video wall. 5. Fault tolerance and automation: Improve the stability of the system through measures: such as setting configuration files to prevent improper operations; using automated tools to avoid manual errors, etc. 6. Network Security: Security measures such as encryption technology and vulnerability scanning tools can be used to protect the system from hackers. 7. Capacity Planning: The system is vulnerable to traffic bursts, so capacity planning is required to expand server capacity and storage resources when needed. The above are only the basic design principles of high-availability architecture, and specific situations need to be analyzed. Therefore, the actual situation should be fully considered to design a most suitable system architecture.
