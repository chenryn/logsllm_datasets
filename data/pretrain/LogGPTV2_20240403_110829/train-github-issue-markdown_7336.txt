`choices` can be a nested array, there is also a `group_by` option in `entity`
type, those can be used to group entities in HTML `optgroup` tags, but this
only work for `select` widgets.
Shouldn't this also be applied to `checkboxes` and `radios` (with a fieldset
and a legend)?
Might help for the use case described in #5286.
