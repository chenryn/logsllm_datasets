ABSTRACT
Many rural areas in developing regions remain largely dis-
connected from the rest of the world due to low purchas-
ing power and the exorbitant cost of existing connectiv-
ity solutions. Wireless Rural Extensions (WiRE) is a low-
power rural wireless network architecture that provides inex-
pensive, self-sustainable, and high-bandwidth connectivity.
WiRE relies on a high-bandwidth directional wireless back-
bone with local distribution networks to provide focused IP
coverage. WiRE also provides cellular connectivity using
OpenBTS-based GSM microcells. It supports a naming and
addressing framework that inter-operates with traditional
telecom networks and enables a wide range of mobile services
on a common IP framework. The entire WiRE network can
be built by integrating a range of oﬀ-the-shelf components
and existing open source tools.

INTRODUCTION
The existing cellular connectivity model is not economi-
cally viable in rural settings due to two fundamental chal-
lenges: a) rural regions lack stable grid-based power sources,
and b) low density and purchasing power of the users leads
to insuﬃcient revenue to cover the high capital and opera-
tionsl expenses.
Wireless Rural Extensions (WiRE) is a low-cost and low-
power rural network architecture that extends data and voice
connectivity from the closest city/town to nearby rural re-
gions. Unlike cellular networks which provide universal cov-
erage at high power consumption, WiRE provides focused
coverage at low power consumption using a highly direc-
tional wireless backhaul network to eﬃciently reach out to
sparsely spread out rural regions. WiRE uses OpenBTS-
based GSM microcells (1–2km radius) and small-scale wire-
less mesh networks to provide cellular and Internet services
within each rural region. The low-power consumption allows
the entire WiRE network to be completely solar-powered

with no dependence on the grid or oil. WiRE leverages and
integrates a large-body of prior work into a uniﬁed rural net-
work connectivity solution for extending cellular and Inter-
net services. Achieving this objective requires us to address
several non-trivial challenges, the following of which are il-
lustrated in this demo: a) builing a back-haul network using
low-cost and low-power hardware, b) using the naming and
addressing layer to manage end-user identities in the face of
network partition and churn, c) enabling low-power cellu-
lar base stations using OpenBTS, and d) end-to-end system
integration.
2. WiRE NETWORK
There are two main components of a WiRE network: a)
local distribution mesh networks that cover small regions
(ROMA [1]), and b) long distance point-to-point links (WiLD-
Net [3]) that form the backbone that connects the regions
together. Each region has an egress point through which
it connects to the back-haul. A region may also leverage
OpenBTS, a software-based GSM base station that oper-
ates over USRP radio boards.
It allows GSM phones to
make calls and terminates calls on the same box, and for-
wards the voice data to the open-source Asterisk PBX sys-
tem via Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX). The advantages are:
a) end-users can use their existing cellular phones, b) it can
be made to inter-operate with existing telephony networks
(§3.2), and c) the power required to run the entire setup
is less than 100W, which is more than an order of magni-
tude lower than traditional GSM base stations, though the
coverage area is restricted to 1 − 2 kms in outdoor settings.
In order to enable telephony, there are PBX servers at the
egress point of each region and at the main gateway to the
city, where the WiRE network connects with the outside
world.
3. NAMING AND ADDRESSING
End-users have unique identities; we need to discover and
locate identities, for telephony and other applications. Let
us say that the network is trying to route a call to an identity
John, and therefore ﬁrst needs to ﬁnd John.
When a client m associates with an infrastructure node p
(the publisher), the information pertaining this client needs
to be disseminated. Inspired by SEATTLE[2], address reso-
lution in WiRE works through a DHT mechanism, with con-
sistent hashing. The underlying routing layer provides the
address resolution layer with the current list of infrastruc-
ture nodes K that are alive and reachable in the network.
For every node k ∈ K, the publisher calculates H(k), where
462H is a standard hash function.
It then calculates H(m),
and the resolver ˆk is chosen as that node k that minimizes
H(k) − H(m). The publisher p then sends a message (over
TCP) to the resolver ˆk, telling it that m is now reachable
through publisher p. The querier uses the identical hashing
mechanism to ﬁnd m. If the publisher p and the querier x
are in the same connected component, we are guaranteed
that they will hit the same resolver node.
3.1 Partitions and Recovery
Say an identity m published by p has been stored at re-
solver r. At some point of time, the network becomes parti-
tioned into P1 and P2, such that p ∈ P1 and r ∈ P2. If any
node in P1 now tries to ﬁnd m, the query will fail because
the querier will choose a diﬀerent resolver s. This resolver s
knows nothing about m because p has not registered m with
it. To overcome this issue, each publisher keeps a local list of
identities that it is the publisher of, along with the resolver
at which this entry is stored. The publisher p periodically
monitors the network topology for changes. Suppose it is the
publisher for identity m and the entry was stored at resolver
r. If r is unreachable from p, it immediately re-hashes m by
choosing a new resolver s (from its present partition) and
stores the entry there. The old resolver r similarly ensures
that it does not store values published by nodes that are not
in its present partition. Finally, when two or more partitions
become reconnected, re-hashing takes place to maintain con-
sistency.
3.2 Voice Calls and Interoperability
We now describe how WiRE enables telephony and inte-
grates with existing telephony providers.
WiRE to WiRE: Assume that an identity m is trying
to call another identity n. Suppose the PBX servers (pub-
lishers) of the region containing m and n are P BX(m) and
P BX(n) respectively. First, m contacts P BX(m) stating
its intention to call n. P BX(m) then uses the address res-
olution layer and queries for n, whereupon it learns that it
needs to tunnel the call to P BX(n). Finally at P BX(n),
the call is again tunnelled through to n.
Outside World to WiRE: An existing cellular net-
work user who wants to also use the WiRE network sets up
call forwarding to a WiRE speciﬁc phone number Ngateway,
which is associated with the PBX gateway. When this user
receives a call on the cellular network but is not reach-
able, the cellular network forwards to Ngateway. Once the
call reaches the WiRE PBX gateway, the destination phone
number is resolved to the particular WiRE identiﬁer (say,
m). This registration (phone number to IMSI number pair-
ing) is done one-time, when the user signs up for WiRE
service. The network then needs to ﬁnd the location of m,
which is done using the techniques discussed above.
WiRE to Outside World: When a WiRE user wants
to make a call to the outside world, the call is simply for-
warded to the PBX gateway at the main gateway of the
WiRE network. This gateway then routes the call through
to the existing telephone service provider.
4. EVALUATION
We expect a WiRE deployment to experience churn; end-
users will enter and exit the network. On our 12-node testbed,
we measure how long it takes for a user identity to be discov-
erable by all other users in the network, after it has joined

the network. Figure 1 is a box-and-whisker plot of the con-
vergence times, as a function of the number of identities at
each of the 12 publishers.
Figure 1: Convergence time varies linearly with the
number of identities published at each node.
Due to many failure scenarios, we would like the network
to be partition tolerant. We artiﬁcially kill nodes to create
partitions, and then measure how long it takes the naming
and addressing layer to re-hash and recover. From Table 1,
we see that in all cases, the convergence time is within ac-
ceptable limits.
In order to study the quality of voice calls, we plot the
PESQ scores over diﬀerent backbone path lengths in Fig-
ure 2. A reference point is given by hop-count 0, which
shows the PESQ score through a wired ethernet connection
is 2.95. Even over long multi-hop wireless paths, the PESQ
scores remain comparable with that of a wired connection.
Figure 2: PESQ scores indicate that the speech quality
is good, even with longer path lengths.
