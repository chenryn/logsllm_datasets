7.3 Evaluation
We implemented the defense logic within the simulator. We
emulate the video tracking by using the ground truth value
of the location and adding Gaussian noise to it with a mean
of 2 meters. We augmented the application with the defense
by following the mitigation steps discussed above. Fig. 13
demonstrates that with the defense in place, the attack im-
pact is mitigated from all attacks other than the fake obstacle
attack where it has a minor effect. The effect is due to the
delay in conﬁrmation from the RSU, during which the safe
mode reduces performance whether there is a real obstacle
or not. This mitigation’s approach will also be able to stop
the dangerous attacks described in Section 6.1. This is due
to the fact that those attacks are bases on the basic attacks
demonstrated in Section 5 but used in speciﬁc scenarios.

9 Related work
A concern with any defense strategy that requires additional
operations is delays in making decisions, while information is
validated. However, we believe that the redundant information
can be prepared proactively so that the check is often local.
Moreover, it is critical to deploy the safe backup operation
while decisions are being taken in any cyber-physical system,
prioritizing safety over performance.
The approach heavily relies on the visual tracking system
and sensors for more reliable decision, which may not be
available in all vehicles and in some areas. Thus, we accept
that it is a strong assumption on our part to assume that such
redundant data will always be available to the decision mak-
ing system. We can see from Fig. 13 that safe mode does
not signiﬁcantly degrade performance in CACC application.
Nevertheless, we will carry out analysis and performance mea-
surements on other CV applications to justify this statement
in the future. In the future work, robust algorithms may be
employed to detect all the different attacks in the early stages.
8 Vulnerabilities in other protocols
In this section, we analyze other protocols and classify the
vulnerabilities using the attack vectors deﬁned in Table 1. We
performed code reviews of two protocols available on the US
DOT open source CV protocol repository [13]: (1) Intelligent
Intersection Management and (2) Eco-Trafﬁc Signal Timing.
Intelligent Intersection Management has shown great po-
tential in improving transportation efﬁcacy especially for au-
tonomous vehicles where it connects with them wirelessly
and schedules their intersection crossing steps. In [17], they
proposed to use existing infrastructure-side sensors to stop
malicious messages. For example, vehicle detectors buried
underneath the stop bar of each lane can be used to measure
aggregated trafﬁc information. After analyzing the scheme,
we found out that malicious messages can still be sent to ma-
nipulate the application and increase total delay time. This is
due to inadequate identiﬁer binding (V3) vulnerability, where
sensors do not correlate the messages with the vehicles and
do not give the exact location for each vehicle.
Eco-Trafﬁc Signal Timing application aims to improve
trafﬁc signals delays thus reducing environmental impact. It
processes real-time and historical CV data at signalized in-
tersections to reduce fuel consumption and overall emissions.
In this application, we discovered that vehicle trajectory data
can be subjected to fake message contents (V1) and inade-
quate identiﬁer binding (V3) vulnerabilities. We were able to
implement exploits to manipulate the timing phase for any
lane based on sending malicious vehicles information.For
both applications, the defense principles we introduced can
be adapted to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
Chen et al. [17] performed a security analysis on a system
called Intelligent Trafﬁc Signal System (I-SIG). In this sys-
tem, a real-time vehicle trajectory data is sent through the
dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology
that is acquired by any CV. This data is then used to control
the sequence and duration of trafﬁc signals. The system that
was attacked includes real deployments at road intersections
in some cities such as Anthem, AZ, and Palo Alto, CA. In
these deployments, it enhanced the trafﬁc by reducing total ve-
hicle delay by 26.6%. The paper presented an attack that can
cause the trafﬁc mobility to be 23.4% worse than that without
adopting I-SIG. The attack consists of a packet spoofed to
tell the I-SIG of a vehicle approaching from a long distance,
causing the trafﬁc light to wait for it, while holding up traf-
ﬁc from other directions. The authors suggested a possible
defense that considers scheduling over multiple periods.
Amoozadeh et al. [14] performed a security and vulnera-
bilities risks analysis related to the VANET communication
in CV in speciﬁc applications including cooperative adaptive
cruise control application (CACC). They focused mainly on
how to attack a single platoon. They considered a CACC ve-
hicle stream that is moving in a straight single-lane highway
where all the vehicles use a simple one vehicle look-ahead
communication scheme. They did not consider the security
credential management system (SCMS) in their simulation.
In their work, they examined existing countermeasures, and
explored the limitations of these methods and possible ways
to lighten negative effects.
Dominic et al. [18] presented a risk assessment framework
for autonomous and cooperative automated driving was con-
ducted to deﬁne a reference scheme for automated vehicles,
and to describe the new attack surfaces and data ﬂow. They
used recent automotive threat models and introduced a novel
application based threat enumeration and analysis approach
that is able to address different automated vehicles applica-
tions across all levels of automation. They also established a
framework with an example application assessment. In their
work, they concluded that their results would guide the de-
sign of the secured automated driving architectures that will
certainly and quickly become necessary.
The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Of-
ﬁce (ITS JPO) [7] worked with its partners with a fund nearly
$25 million to support a foundational vehicle cyber security
threat assessment for CV applications. Their work includes
designing, developing, and operating the security credential
management system (SCMS) for the CV Safety Pilot eval-
uations were conducted in some cities such as Ann Arbor,
Michigan, as well as the current US DOT CV pilot studies in
NYC [11], Tampa [12], and Wyoming [10]. They developed
certiﬁcation practices to check equipment prior to implementa-
tion in the Safety Pilot to ensure that they meet cyber security
requirements. The program is also working to ease provid-

one of the goals is to improve the best practices for handling
foundational electronics control and reliability cyber threat
information for existing vehicle ﬂeets.
10 Concluding Remarks
Connected Vehicles (CVs) is an emerging ﬁeld in transporta-
tion that is garnering interest from the US DOT because it
promises to bring about a new age of transportation where ve-
hicles and transportation infrastructure are all interconnected
wirelessly. However, many applications are still not consider-
ing their security vulnerabilities. This paper shows that one
of the most complete reference implementations of a CVs
protocol (for Cooperative Automatic Cruise Control) is vul-
nerable to attacks of many types, even under a threat model
that considers the state-of-the-art SCMS certiﬁcate based se-
curity standard being developed for these applications. These
attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities of these communica-
tion protocols, may lead to a complete reversal of the beneﬁts
made by CVs, and as such, they have a ways to go before it is
reliably safe from attacks. We demonstrated these attacks in
simulation and showed their impact on safety, performance,
and economy of the trafﬁc.
It also introduces a defense scheme that places vehicles
in a safe mode while they check the consistency of received
information against an estimate of the local trafﬁc state con-
structed through video analytics at the road side unit. Finally,
we showed that the proposed defenses are able to mitigate all
the attacks we introduced, making it a promising approach to
support security in CV applications.
