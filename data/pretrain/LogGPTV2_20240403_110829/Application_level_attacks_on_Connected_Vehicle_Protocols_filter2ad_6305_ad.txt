### 7.3 Evaluation

We implemented the defense logic within the simulator to evaluate its effectiveness. To emulate video tracking, we used the ground truth location values and added Gaussian noise with a mean of 2 meters. The application was augmented with the defense mechanism by following the mitigation steps discussed in the previous sections. As shown in Fig. 13, the defense significantly mitigates the impact of all attacks except for the fake obstacle attack, where it has a minor effect. This minor effect is due to the delay in confirmation from the Road Side Unit (RSU), during which the safe mode reduces performance, regardless of whether there is a real obstacle or not. This mitigation approach is also effective against the dangerous attacks described in Section 6.1, as those attacks are based on the basic attacks demonstrated in Section 5 but applied in specific scenarios.

### 7.4 Discussion

#### 9. Related Work

A concern with any defense strategy that requires additional operations is the potential for delays in decision-making while information is being validated. However, we believe that redundant information can be prepared proactively, allowing for local checks to minimize these delays. Moreover, it is critical to deploy a safe backup operation in any cyber-physical system to prioritize safety over performance during decision-making.

Our approach heavily relies on the visual tracking system and sensors for more reliable decisions, which may not be available in all vehicles and in some areas. Therefore, it is a strong assumption on our part to assume that such redundant data will always be available to the decision-making system. As shown in Fig. 13, the safe mode does not significantly degrade performance in the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) application. Nevertheless, we plan to conduct further analysis and performance measurements on other CV applications to validate this statement. In future work, robust algorithms may be employed to detect various attacks at an early stage.

### 8. Vulnerabilities in Other Protocols

In this section, we analyze other protocols and classify their vulnerabilities using the attack vectors defined in Table 1. We performed code reviews of two protocols available in the US DOT open source CV protocol repository [13]: (1) Intelligent Intersection Management and (2) Eco-Traffic Signal Timing.

**Intelligent Intersection Management:**
This protocol has shown great potential in improving transportation efficiency, especially for autonomous vehicles, by connecting wirelessly and scheduling intersection crossing steps. In [17], the authors proposed using existing infrastructure-side sensors, such as vehicle detectors buried under stop bars, to prevent malicious messages. However, our analysis revealed that malicious messages can still manipulate the application and increase total delay time. This vulnerability is due to inadequate identifier binding (V3), where sensors do not correlate messages with vehicles and do not provide exact vehicle locations.

**Eco-Traffic Signal Timing:**
This application aims to reduce traffic signal delays and environmental impact by processing real-time and historical CV data at signalized intersections. We discovered that vehicle trajectory data in this application is susceptible to fake message contents (V1) and inadequate identifier binding (V3) vulnerabilities. We were able to implement exploits to manipulate the timing phase for any lane based on sending malicious vehicle information. For both applications, the defense principles we introduced can be adapted to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

**Chen et al. [17] Analysis:**
Chen et al. conducted a security analysis on the Intelligent Traffic Signal System (I-SIG). This system uses dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology to send real-time vehicle trajectory data, which is then used to control traffic signals. Deployments in cities like Anthem, AZ, and Palo Alto, CA, showed a 26.6% reduction in total vehicle delay. However, the paper presented an attack that could worsen traffic mobility by 23.4%. The attack involved spoofing packets to make the I-SIG wait for a non-existent vehicle, causing delays in other directions. The authors suggested a possible defense that considers scheduling over multiple periods.

**Amoozadeh et al. [14] Analysis:**
Amoozadeh et al. performed a security and vulnerability risk analysis related to VANET communication in CVs, focusing on the CACC application. They examined how to attack a single platoon and considered a CACC vehicle stream moving in a straight single-lane highway. Their simulation did not include the Security Credential Management System (SCMS). They explored existing countermeasures and their limitations, as well as ways to mitigate negative effects.

**Dominic et al. [18] Analysis:**
Dominic et al. presented a risk assessment framework for autonomous and cooperative automated driving. They defined a reference scheme for automated vehicles and described new attack surfaces and data flows. Using recent automotive threat models, they introduced a novel application-based threat enumeration and analysis approach. Their framework included an example application assessment, concluding that their results would guide the design of secure automated driving architectures.

**ITS JPO [7] Work:**
The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) worked with partners to support a foundational vehicle cybersecurity threat assessment for CV applications, funded with nearly $25 million. Their work included designing, developing, and operating the SCMS for the CV Safety Pilot evaluations in cities like Ann Arbor, Michigan, and current US DOT CV pilot studies in NYC, Tampa, and Wyoming. They developed certification practices to ensure equipment meets cybersecurity requirements and are working to provide certification services for different industries. One of their goals is to improve best practices for handling foundational electronics control and reliability cyber threat information for existing vehicle fleets.

### 10. Concluding Remarks

Connected Vehicles (CVs) are an emerging field in transportation, garnering significant interest from the US DOT due to their potential to revolutionize transportation by interconnecting vehicles and infrastructure wirelessly. However, many applications still lack consideration for security vulnerabilities. This paper demonstrates that even one of the most complete reference implementations of a CV protocol (for CACC) is vulnerable to various types of attacks, even under a threat model that considers state-of-the-art SCMS certificate-based security standards. These attacks can reverse the benefits of CVs, making it clear that there is still much work to be done to ensure reliable security.

We introduced a defense scheme that places vehicles in a safe mode while checking the consistency of received information against an estimate of the local traffic state constructed through video analytics at the RSU. Our results show that the proposed defenses can mitigate all the attacks we introduced, making it a promising approach to enhance security in CV applications.
