supply chain.  
Outputs and Post Conditions  
Within the scope of [NIST SP 800-39], the output of the risk framing step is the risk 
management strategy that identifies how enterprises intend to assess, respond to, and monitor 
risk over time. This strategy should clearly include any identified C-SCRM considerations and 
should result in the establishment of C-SCRM-specific processes throughout the agency. These 
processes should be documented in one of three ways: 
1. Integrated into existing agency documentation, 
2. Described in a separate set of documents that address C-SCRM, or 
3. Utilizing a mix of separate and integrated documents based on agency needs and 
operations. 
Regardless of how the outputs are documented, the following information should be provided as 
an output of the risk framing step: 
• C-SCRM policy; 
• Criticality, including prioritized mission and business processes and [FIPS 199] impact; 
• Cybersecurity supply chain risk assessment methodology and guidance; 
• Cybersecurity supply chain risk response guidance; 
• Cybersecurity supply chain risk monitoring guidance; 
• C-SCRM mission and business requirements; 
• Revised mission and business processes and enterprise architecture with C-SCRM 
considerations integrated;  
• Operational level C-SCRM requirements; and 
• Acquisition security guidance/requirements. 
Outputs from the risk framing step enable prerequisites to effectively manage cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain and serve as inputs to the risk assessment, risk response, and risk 
monitoring steps. 
Assess  
Inputs and Preconditions 
Assess is the step where assumptions, established methodologies, and collected data are used to 
conduct a risk assessment. Numerous inputs (including criticality, risk appetite and tolerance, 
threats, vulnerability analysis, stakeholder knowledge, policy, constraints, and requirements) are 
combined and analyzed to gauge the likelihood and impact of a supply chain cybersecurity

compromise. Assess step activities are used to update the enterprise’s long-term risk-framing 
assumptions to account for near-term variations and changes.  
A cybersecurity supply chain risk assessment should be integrated into the overall enterprise risk 
assessment process. C-SCRM risk assessment results should be used and aggregated as 
appropriate to communicate potential or actual cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain 
relevant to each risk management framework level. Figure G-6 depicts the Assess step with its 
inputs and outputs along the three levels.

Criticality, vulnerability, and threat analyses are essential to the supply chain risk assessment 
process. The order of activities begins with updating the criticality analysis to ensure that the 
assessment is scoped to minimally include relevant critical mission and business processes and to 
understand the relevance and impact of supply chain elements on these mission and business 
processes. As depicted in Figure G-5, vulnerability and threat analyses can then be performed in 
any order but should be performed iteratively to ensure that all applicable threats and

vulnerabilities have been identified to understand which vulnerabilities may be more susceptible 
to exploitation by certain threats and – if and as applicable – to associate identified 
vulnerabilities and threats to one or more mission and business processes or supply chain 
elements. Once viable threats and potential or actual vulnerabilities are assessed, this information 
will be used to evaluate the likelihood of exploitability – a key step to understanding impact. 
This is a synthesis point for criticality analysis, vulnerability analysis, and threat analysis and 
helps to further clarify and contextualize impact to support an informed and justifiable risk 
decision. 
Activities 
CRITICALITY ANALYSIS 
TASK 2-0: Update the criticality analysis of mission and business processes, systems, and 
system components to narrow the scope (and resource needs) for C-SCRM activities to those 
most important to mission success. 
Supplemental Guidance 
Criticality analysis should include the supply chain for the enterprise and applicable suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers, as well as relevant non-system services and products. Criticality analysis 
assesses the direct impact that each entity has on mission priorities. The supply chain includes 
the SDLC for applicable systems, services, and components because the SDLC defines whether 
security considerations are built into the systems/components or added after the 
systems/components have been created.  
Enterprises should update and tailor criticality established during the Frame step of the risk 
management process, including the [FIPS 199] system. For low-impact systems, enterprises 
should minimally assess criticality regarding interdependencies that systems may have with 
moderate or high-impact systems. If systems are used extensively throughout the enterprise, 
enterprises should determine the holistic impact of component failure or compromise in the low 
impact system.  
In addition to updating and tailoring criticality, performing criticality analysis in the Assess step 
may include the following: 
• Refining the dependency analysis and assessment to understand which components may 
require hardening given the system or network architecture; 
• Obtaining and reviewing existing information that the agency has about critical 
systems/components, such as locations where they are manufactured or developed, 
physical and logical delivery paths, information flows and financial transactions

associated with these components, and any other available information that can provide 
insights into the supply chain of these components;67 and 
• Updating information about the supply chain, historical data, and the SDLC to identify 
changes in critical supply chain paths and conditions. 
The outcome of the updated criticality analysis is a narrowed, prioritized list of the enterprise’s 
critical processes, systems, and system components, as well as a refined understanding of 
corresponding dependencies within the supply chain. Enterprises can use the criticality process 
in Task 1-1 to update their criticality analysis. 
Because more information will be available in the Assess step, enterprises can narrow the scope 
and increase the granularity of a criticality analysis. When identifying critical processes and 
associated systems/components and assigning them criticality levels, consider the following: 
• Functional breakdown is an effective method for identifying processes and associated 
critical components and supporting defensive functions.  
• Disaster recovery and continuity of operations plans often define critical systems and 
system components, which can be helpful in assigning criticality.  
• Dependency analysis is used to identify the processes on which other critical processes 
depend (e.g., defensive functions, such as digital signatures used in software patch 
acceptance).  
• The identification of all access points helps identify and limit unmediated access to 
critical functions and components (e.g., least-privilege implementation).  
• Value chain analysis enables the understanding of inputs, process actors, outputs, and 
customers of services and products.  
• Malicious alteration or other types of supply chain compromise can happen throughout 
the SDLC. 
The resulting list of critical processes and supply chain dependencies is used to guide and inform 
vulnerability analysis and threat analysis in determining the initial C-SCRM risk, as depicted in 
Figure D-4. Supply chain countermeasures and mitigations can then be selected and 
implemented to reduce risk to acceptable levels.  
Criticality analysis is performed iteratively and may be performed at any point in the SDLC and 
concurrently by level. The first iteration is likely to identify critical processes and systems or 
components that have a direct impact on mission and business processes. Successive iterations 
will include information from the criticality analysis, threat analysis, vulnerability analysis, and 
mitigation strategies defined at each of the other levels. Each iteration will refine the criticality 
analysis outcomes and result in the addition of defensive functions. Several iterations will likely 
be required to establish and maintain criticality analysis results. Enterprises should document or 
67 This information may be available from a supply chain map for the agency or individual IT projects or systems. Supply chain 
maps are descriptions or depictions of supply chains that include the physical and logical flow of goods, information, processes, 
and money upstream and downstream through a supply chain. They may include supply chain entities, locations, delivery paths, 
or transactions.

record the results of their criticality analysis and review and update this assessment on an annual 
basis, at minimum.  
THREAT AND VULNERABILITY IDENTIFICATION  
TASK 2-1: Identify threats to and vulnerabilities in enterprise information systems and the 
environments in which the systems operate. 
Supplemental Guidance 
In addition to threat and vulnerability identification, as described in [NIST SP 800-39] and 
[NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1], enterprises should conduct supply chain cybersecurity threat analysis 
and vulnerability analysis. 
Threat Analysis 
For C-SCRM, a threat analysis provides specific and timely characterizations of threat events 
(see Appendix C), potential threat actors (e.g., nation-state), and threat vectors (e.g., third-party 
supplier) to inform management, acquisition, engineering, and operational activities within an 
enterprise.68 A variety of information can be used to assess potential threats, including open 
source, intelligence, and counterintelligence. Enterprises should include, update, and refine the 
threat sources and assumptions defined during the Frame step. The results of the threat analysis 
will ultimately support acquisition decisions, alternative build decisions, and the development 
and selection of appropriate mitigations to be applied in the Respond step. The focus of supply 
chain threat analysis should be based on the results of the criticality analysis.  
Enterprises should use the information available from existing incident management activities to 
determine whether they have experienced a supply chain cybersecurity compromise and to 
further investigate such compromises. Agencies should define criteria for what constitutes a 
supply chain cybersecurity compromise to ensure that such compromises can be identified as a 
part of post-incident activities, including forensics investigations. Additionally – at agency-
defined intervals – agencies should review other sources of incident information within the 
enterprise to determine whether a supply chain compromise has occurred.  
A supply chain cybersecurity threat analysis should capture at least the following data: 
• An observation of cybersecurity supply chain-related attacks while they are occurring; 
• Incident data collected post-cybersecurity supply chain-related compromise; 
• An observation of tactics, techniques, and procedures used in specific attacks, whether 
observed or collected using audit mechanisms; and 
• Natural and human-made disasters before, during, and after occurrence. 
68 Note that the threat characterization of suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers may be benign.

Vulnerability Analysis 
For C-SCRM, a vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security 
procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat 
source [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5].  
A vulnerability analysis is an iterative process that informs risk assessments and countermeasure 
selection. The vulnerability analysis works alongside the threat analysis to help inform the 
impact analysis and to help scope and prioritize the vulnerabilities to be mitigated.  
Vulnerability analysis in the Assess step should use the approaches defined during the Frame 
step to update and refine assumptions about supply chain cybersecurity vulnerabilities. 
Vulnerability analysis should begin by identifying vulnerabilities that are applicable to critical 
mission and business processes and the systems or system components identified by the 
criticality analysis. An investigation of vulnerabilities may indicate the need to raise or at least 
reconsider the criticality levels of processes and components identified in earlier criticality 
analyses. Later iterations of the vulnerability analysis may also identify additional threats or 
opportunities for threats that were not considered in earlier threat assessments.  
Table G-8 provides examples of applicable supply chain cybersecurity vulnerabilities that can be 
observed within the three levels.

Level 
Vulnerability Consideration 
Methods 
Level 1 – 
Enterprise 
1) Deficiencies or weaknesses in 
enterprise governance 
structures or processes, such as 
the lack of a C-SCRM Plan 
2) Weaknesses in the supply chain 
itself (e.g., vulnerable entities, 
over-reliance on certain 
entities) 
1) Provide guidance on how to consider 
dependencies on external enterprises 
as vulnerabilities. 
2) Seek out alternative sources of new 
technology, including building in-
house and leveraging trustworthy 
shared services and common 
solutions. 
Level 2 – 
Mission and 
Business 
1) No operational process in place 
for detecting counterfeits 
2) No budget allocated for the 
implementation of a technical 
screening for acceptance 
testing of supplied system 
components entering the SDLC 
as replacement parts  
1) Develop a program for detecting 
tainted or counterfeit products, and 
allocate an appropriate budget for 
resources and training. 
2) Allocate a budget for acceptance 
testing (technical screening of 
components entering the SDLC).
