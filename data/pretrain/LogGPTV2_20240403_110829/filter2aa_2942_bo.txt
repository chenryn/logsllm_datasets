### Supply Chain

#### Outputs and Post Conditions
Within the scope of [NIST SP 800-39], the output of the risk framing step is a risk management strategy that outlines how enterprises plan to assess, respond to, and monitor risks over time. This strategy should clearly incorporate any identified C-SCRM (Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management) considerations and should result in the establishment of C-SCRM-specific processes throughout the agency. These processes can be documented in one of three ways:
1. Integrated into existing agency documentation.
2. Described in a separate set of documents that address C-SCRM.
3. Utilizing a mix of separate and integrated documents based on the agency's needs and operations.

Regardless of the documentation method, the following information should be provided as an output of the risk framing step:
- C-SCRM policy.
- Criticality, including prioritized mission and business processes and [FIPS 199] impact.
- Cybersecurity supply chain risk assessment methodology and guidance.
- Cybersecurity supply chain risk response guidance.
- Cybersecurity supply chain risk monitoring guidance.
- C-SCRM mission and business requirements.
- Revised mission and business processes and enterprise architecture with C-SCRM considerations integrated.
- Operational-level C-SCRM requirements.
- Acquisition security guidance/requirements.

Outputs from the risk framing step enable the prerequisites for effectively managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and serve as inputs to the risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring steps.

#### Assess
##### Inputs and Preconditions
The "Assess" step involves using assumptions, established methodologies, and collected data to conduct a risk assessment. Numerous inputs, such as criticality, risk appetite and tolerance, threats, vulnerability analysis, stakeholder knowledge, policy, constraints, and requirements, are combined and analyzed to gauge the likelihood and impact of a supply chain cybersecurity compromise. The "Assess" step activities are used to update the enterpriseâ€™s long-term risk-framing assumptions to account for near-term variations and changes.

A cybersecurity supply chain risk assessment should be integrated into the overall enterprise risk assessment process. C-SCRM risk assessment results should be used and aggregated as appropriate to communicate potential or actual cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain relevant to each risk management framework level. Figure G-6 depicts the "Assess" step with its inputs and outputs along the three levels.

**Figure G-6: C-SCRM in the Assess Step**

Criticality, vulnerability, and threat analyses are essential to the supply chain risk assessment process. The order of activities begins with updating the criticality analysis to ensure that the assessment is scoped to minimally include relevant critical mission and business processes and to understand the relevance and impact of supply chain elements on these processes. As depicted in Figure G-5, vulnerability and threat analyses can then be performed in any order but should be performed iteratively to ensure that all applicable threats and vulnerabilities have been identified.

**Inputs and Outputs at Different Levels:**

**Enterprise Level:**
- **Inputs:**
  - Enterprise and C-SCRM risk assessment methodologies.
  - Breadth and depth requirements for risk analysis.
  - Guidance for aggregating risk to the enterprise-level.
  - Output of Level 1 C-SCRM.
- **Outputs:**
  - Aggregated enterprise-level C-SCRM risk profile.
  - Enterprise-level supply chain cybersecurity risk assessment results.

**Mission/Business Process Level:**
- **Inputs:**
  - Mission/business-specific C-SCRM risk assessment methodologies.
  - Output of Level 2 C-SCRM.
  - Guidance for aggregating risk to the specific mission/business.
  - Level 2 and 3 C-SCRM Assessments.
  - C-SCRM risk monitoring outputs.
  - Supplier inventory.
  - Asset inventory.
- **Outputs:**
  - Aggregated mission/business-specific C-SCRM risk profile.
  - Mission/business-specific supply chain cybersecurity risk assessment results.

**Operational Level:**
- **Inputs:**
  - Operational-level C-SCRM requirements.
  - Operational business impact analyses for supported missions/businesses.
  - System component inventory.
  - Supplier inventory.
  - Operational C-SCRM risk monitoring outputs.
- **Outputs:**
  - Operational-level risk assessment results.

**Activities:**

**Criticality Analysis (Task 2-0):**
- **Objective:** Update the criticality analysis of mission and business processes, systems, and system components to narrow the scope (and resource needs) for C-SCRM activities to those most important to mission success.
- **Supplemental Guidance:**
  - Criticality analysis should include the supply chain for the enterprise and applicable suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers, as well as relevant non-system services and products.
  - Enterprises should update and tailor criticality established during the Frame step of the risk management process, including the [FIPS 199] system.
  - Additional activities may include refining dependency analysis, obtaining and reviewing existing information about critical systems/components, and updating information about the supply chain, historical data, and the SDLC.

**Threat and Vulnerability Identification (Task 2-1):**
- **Objective:** Identify threats to and vulnerabilities in enterprise information systems and the environments in which the systems operate.
- **Supplemental Guidance:**
  - For C-SCRM, a threat analysis provides specific and timely characterizations of threat events, potential threat actors, and threat vectors to inform management, acquisition, engineering, and operational activities within an enterprise.
  - A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5].
  - Vulnerability analysis is an iterative process that informs risk assessments and countermeasure selection, working alongside the threat analysis to help inform the impact analysis and to help scope and prioritize the vulnerabilities to be mitigated.

**Table G-8: Examples of Supply Chain Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Mapped to the Enterprise Levels**

| Level | Vulnerability Consideration | Methods |
|-------|-----------------------------|---------|
| **Enterprise** | 1) Deficiencies or weaknesses in enterprise governance structures or processes, such as the lack of a C-SCRM Plan. <br> 2) Weaknesses in the supply chain itself (e.g., vulnerable entities, over-reliance on certain entities). | 1) Provide guidance on how to consider dependencies on external enterprises as vulnerabilities. <br> 2) Seek out alternative sources of new technology, including building in-house and leveraging trustworthy shared services and common solutions. |
| **Mission and Business** | 1) No operational process in place for detecting counterfeits. <br> 2) No budget allocated for the implementation of a technical screening for acceptance testing of supplied system components entering the SDLC as replacement parts. | 1) Develop a program for detecting tainted or counterfeit products, and allocate an appropriate budget for resources and training. <br> 2) Allocate a budget for acceptance testing (technical screening of components entering the SDLC). |

This structured approach ensures that the C-SCRM process is comprehensive, well-documented, and aligned with the overall risk management strategy of the enterprise.
