bution of lengths between 50 and 600 m as given to us by a
large telco. We use two diﬀerent service proﬁles: (i) the ﬁrst
with plan downstream bit rate of 30 Mbps, (ii) the second
with plan downstream bit rate of 62 Mbps.
6.3 Results
Based on the average bit rate measured as we vary the
number of active lines, we compute the average per-line
speedup as the relative bit rate gain w.r.t.

rate of having all lines active. Fig. 14 presents the average
and standard deviation of the per-line performance increase,
computed over all random sequences each of which is mea-
sured twice to account for the non-deterministic nature of
the measured medium.
Considering the proﬁle at 62 Mbps, it can be seen that
there is an increase in bit rate of 1.1-1.2% for each modem
that becomes inactive. When half of the modems are oﬀ,
the remaining modems can obtain 13.6% more bandwidth,
whereas when increasing the powered oﬀ modems to around
75% the speedup climbs to 25%.
7. RELATED WORK
Improving the energy eﬃciency of
Greening networks.
the Internet is currently a very active area of research (see
[43] for a detailed survey). Most of the eﬀorts have focused
on backbone networks. For instance, Chabarek et al. [6] pre-
sented an energy-aware network design methodology. Vasi´c
et al. [7] proposed a traﬃc engineering scheme that matches
active network devices to the current traﬃc load. Heller et
al. [44] discussed a similar approach for datacenter networks.
Arguing for hardware support of energy-aware capabili-
ties, Nedevschi et al. [5] quantiﬁed the savings that can be
achieved by shaping traﬃc into bursts to enable putting net-
work components to sleep during idle times and by adapting
the rate of network operation to the oﬀered load. Applying
such techniques to DSL is not straightforward due to two
main issues: (i) putting a DSL modem to sleep would tear
347down the connection and restoring it with the current DSL
speciﬁcations would require a new synchronization phase
that can last tens of seconds, and (ii) rate adaption may
lower the transmission power to the point where crosstalk
from other active lines becomes a severe impairment.
Greening access networks. Approaches for saving en-
ergy in access networks include those that advocate network
re-engineering and works that improve energy eﬃciency of
broadband technologies. Bianco et al. [45] provided an anal-
ysis of the energy consumption trends in Telecom Italia and
discussed the deployment of VDSL2 in FTTx architectures.
Tsiaﬂakis et al. [46] and Guenach et al. [47] suggested a refor-
mulation of dynamic spectrum management for minimizing
power consumption of DSL. These works showed that adding
objectives or constraints for limiting the transmit power in
DSL modems ultimately reduces date rate performance and
may render active lines less stable.
Looking at the enterprise environment, Jardosh et al. [33]
proposed an approach for powering oﬀ APs in enterprise
wireless networks. Although the underlying ideas and objec-
tives are similar to BH2, the two settings are substantially
diﬀerent. Jardosh et al. assumed a centralized controller
that can map terminals to APs in a setting where APs com-
municate through a shared backbone. In our case, assum-
ing a centralized controller would be challenging in terms
of both scalability and amount of change to the existing ar-
chitecture. However, we consider this work complementary
and some of its techniques may be utilized to provide a cen-
tralized solution to the problem BH2 solves.
Exploiting neighbor’s wireless. Building on the obser-
vation of increasingly frequent high-density wireless deploy-
ments, several schemes have been proposed to aggregate
bandwidth from neighboring wireless networks. Systems like
FatVAP [31] and THEMIS [30] demonstrated the feasibility
of aggregating the backhaul capacity of multiple APs using
a single virtualized wireless card. PERM [38] discussed how
to schedule ﬂows across accessible APs based on predicting
of ﬂow round-trip time or traﬃc volume. CUBS [26] and
Link-alike [39] focused on sharing the idle upload bandwidth
of neighbors to improve P2P applications and ﬁle uploads.
COMBINE [32] presented a system for collaborative down-
loading and speciﬁed a framework of incentives that could
also help address several practical issues in our proposal.
While diﬀerent in their speciﬁcs all of them are in essence
trying to maximize the transmission capacity. Our work is
dual to that objective as it attempts to minimize the com-
mitted energy for carrying a given amount of traﬃc. At the
same time, BH2 takes advantage of some of these techniques
to carry traﬃc on diﬀerent gateways.
Network connectivity proxies. Tackling the problem of
reducing power consumption from a diﬀerent angle, several
works (e.g., Nedevschi et al. [8], Reich et al. [9], Agarwal et
al. [10]) argued that putting end hosts to sleep yields sub-
stantial energy savings that, however, are diﬃcult to obtain
because users keep unused end hosts fully powered-on only
to maintain their network presence. They suggested using
network connectivity proxies that allow idle hosts to sleep
and still maintain full network presence. Unlike our pro-
posal, such proxies cannot be used when the user is actively
using its terminal. By maintaining the connections, they
also eliminate energy saving opportunities at the ISP.
8. CONCLUSION
The biggest fraction of wired network energy is consumed
by the access network, even though the individual access
devices themselves have small power requirements. Unfor-
tunately, straightforward techniques for sleeping during idle
periods are ineﬃcient in this environment because of the
continuous lightweight traﬃc, and the absence of alterna-
tive paths that could carry the traﬃc.
In this paper, we formalize the problem of saving energy in
the predominantly DSL-based access networks, and describe
two simple techniques: (i) wireless user traﬃc aggregation
that enables access devices to ﬁrmly sleep, and (ii) switch-
ing at the ISP side that signiﬁcantly increases the number
of power-hungry line cards that can sleep. Our thorough
evaluation using trace-based simulation and a live prototype
shows that for typical urban settings it is possible to save
66% of access network energy on average, while being within
7-35% of the computationally-hard optimal aggregation and
impractical optimal switching. Moreover, our results show
that both of our proposed techniques signiﬁcantly contribute
to the overall savings, which argue for their individual im-
portance. Finally, we demonstrate using live experiments
that energy-saving in the access network brings a surprising
speedup in achievable access link bit rates due to reduced
crosstalk.

APPENDIX
We investigate if there is any correlation between the ge-
ographical distance of two customers and the relative dis-
tances of their ports in the DSLAM. We collect information
from two production ADSL2+ DSLAMs of a large ISP in
two major cities. We discuss one of them, since both yield
similar results. Fig. 15 shows the distribution of the port
attenuations measured in each of the 14 active line cards of
72 ports each. We plot the attenuations from n to n + 100,
where n is not disclosed to protect sensitive information.
It is important to know that the attenuation measured
for a line indicates the reduction in signal strength on that
line, and represents the natural deterioration of the signal
over distance from the MDF. We assume that there are no
other external sources of attenuation, such as poor/unequal
quality of the copper wires or the MDF connections. The
production DSLAMs we measure are being actively main-
tained, and the ISP routinely discards lines that show sub-
par quality. In ADSL2+, a diﬀerence of 1dB in attenuation
corresponds to a cable length of roughly 230 feet (70 m).
Fig. 15 shows that across all line cards the attenuation has
a similar Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation
of one mile with minimal variations in mean. Given this
randomness in the attenuation distribution, we assume that
the assignment of gateways to DSLAM ports is random, and
does not depend on their geographical proximity.
