do not reply back to our probes, and evaluate the exact
match rate again. With this approach, our exact match rate
raises to 94.9% and 97.3% for Internet2 and GEANT, re-
spectively. In the third approach, we use each of the subnet
preﬁx lengths in the original topology as a point in an n-
dimensional euclidean space and measure the percentage of
similarity of the collected topology to the original topology.
This approach allows us to asses the amount of deviation
from the original topology rather than looking upon it as a
binary match/not-match value. Results show that the sub-
net preﬁx length similarity including unresponsive subnets
for Internet2 and GEANT are 0.83 and 0.900 respectively.
Our fourth approach is also based on the similarity in eu-
clidean space, however, we use subnet size instead of preﬁx
length as the coordinate space. We obtain similarity rates of
0.86 and 0.907 for Internet2 and GEANT respectively again
including unresponsive subnets.
We ﬁrst derive original Internet2[2] and GEANT[1] subnet
topologies as our ground truth. Tracenet collects a subnet
on-the-ﬂy while tracing towards a destination if it appears
on the end-to-end path. However, we cannot control the
path taken by a packet and make it to pass through a cer-
tain subnet or router. Thus, we build destination IP address
sets for Internet2 and GEANT by selecting a random IP ad-
dress from each of their original subnets. Below we present
the details of the experiments in the context of the afore-
mentioned approaches.

tables the ﬁrst row (orgl ) show the original subnet preﬁx
distribution. The second row (exmt) shows the distribution
of the subnets collected exactly as in the original topology.
The third (miss) and ﬁfth (undes) rows respectively show
missing subnets that could not be discovered at all and un-
derestimated subnets that inferred to be smaller than the
originals. We further divide missing and underestimated
distributions into two sets shown in fourth (miss\unrs) and
sixth (undes\unrs) rows in order to observe whether the
missing or underestimated subnets result from unresponsive
hosts or incompetence of our heuristics. We believe that
this distinction is important to show that a misinferred sub-
net which is behind a ﬁrewall that is ﬁltering out our probe
packets, e.g., totally unresponsive subnet, or utilizing only a
sub-portion of its capacity, e.g., partially unresponsive sub-
net cannot be attributed as drawback of tracenet. The
seventh (ovres), eighth (splt), and ninth (merg) rows show
the overestimated subnets that are inferred to be larger than
the original subnet, split, and merged subnets, respectively.
Given two subnets Sa and Sb that have their IP addresses
from two consecutive address ranges, if the two subnets are
incorrectly inferred to be a single subnet Sab with the cor-
responding IP addresses, then they are considered to be
merged. On the other hand, if one of them is collected ac-
curately and the other one is collected as Sab then the ﬁrst
one is considered to be an exact match and the second one
is considered to be an overestimation.
The exact match rate of tracenet over Internet2 is 73.7%
including unresponsive subnets and is 94.9% excluding to-
tally unresponsive subnets. Internet2 topology is a special
topology that consists of many small sized (mostly point-
to-point) subnets at the backbone and a few larger subnets

behind some ﬁrewall that ﬁlters out ICMP messages or con-
ﬁgured not to respond to any direct probe. After collecting
the subnets we further probed every IP address within the
address range of the missing and underestimated subnets to
identify the unresponsive subnets. The results show that 19
out of 22 of the underestimated and 21 out of 24 of the miss-
ing subnets are caused by partially and totally unresponsive
subnets, respectively. When we analysed the two underes-
timated /28 subnetworks shown in Table 1, we found that
only 2 IP addresses were observed to be utilized in the ﬁrst
network and only 5 are observed to be utilized in the second
network. Besides, the utilized IP addresses of the IP address
range of the second network have large gaps, so line 19 of
algorithm 1 stops growing the subnet prematurely.

The exact match rate of tracenet over GEANT is 53.5%
including unresponsive subnets and is 97.3% excluding to-
tally unresponsive subnets. Published GEANT topology
mostly consists of /30 and /29 subnets. Although trace-
net’s success rate with /30 networks is high, it misses most
of /29 and /28 subnets. Studying those missed or underes-
timated subnets further by probing each and every possible
IP address in the original subnet reveals the fact that those
subnets mostly do not respond to the probes. That is, ei-
ther our probe packets or their responses were ﬁltered out
or those subnets are not realized despite they are published
to exist.
4.1.2 Similarity Rate Evaluation
To have an idea on the success rate other than exact
match rate, we analyze the divergence of the collected In-
ternet2/GEANT subnet topologies from the original ones.
One can regard each subnet as a feature of the topology and

subnet preﬁx as the value of that feature. Therefore, we can
measure the similarity of the collected topology to the origi-
nal topology in an n-dimensional euclidean space, where n is
the number of subnets, by deﬁning a proper distance func-
tion. We compute the distance factor of a given subnet Si
simply by taking the absolute value of the diﬀerence between
its original and collected preﬁx lengths. Below is the preﬁx
distance factor function:

for subnet i, pu and pl are upper and lower preﬁx values
found in the original or collected topology. Original In-
ternet2 network has upper and lower boundary values of
pu = 31, pl = 24 respectively and GEANT has pu = 30,
pl = 28. For missing subnets we take the maximum of dis-
tances to the boundaries in favor of dissimilarity. Hereby,
the dissimilarity of the topologies can be evaluated by the
well known Minkowski distance of order k as

Based on equation (3) the similarity rate for Internet2 and
GEANT are 0.83 and 0.900 respectively while zero means to-
tally dissimilar and one means exactly the same. Compared
to Internet2, GEANT, having a smaller preﬁx length range
inherently makes its similarity to be larger.
Although equations (1), (2), and (3) present valuable in-
sights related to similarity, they are not sensitive to the dif-
ferences in the sizes of subnets (e.g., |/29 subnet|−|/30 subnet|
= 4 vs |/23 subnet| − |/24 subnet| = 256 though both have
a diﬀerence of one in terms of preﬁx length). To reﬂect this
diﬀerence, we compute the distance factor of a given sub-
net Si simply by taking the absolute value of the diﬀerence
between its original and collected subnet sizes. Below, we
deﬁne a new distance factor function called as size distance
factor function:
(cid:12)d(Si) =

distances to the boundaries in favor of dissimilarity.
Based on the equation (5), the subnet size similarities be-

topologies are 0.86 and 0.907 respectively while zero means
totally dissimilar and one means exactly the same.
