# Deploy Azure Data Explorer cluster into your Virtual Network
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consider moving to an Azure Private Endpoint based solution for implementing network security with Azure Data Explorer. It is less error-prone and provides [feature parity](security-network-overview.md#private-endpoint-vs-virtual-network-injection).
This article explains the resources that are present when you deploy an Azure Data Explorer cluster into a custom Azure Virtual Network. This information will help you deploy a cluster into a subnet in your Virtual Network (VNet). For more information on Azure Virtual Networks, see [What is Azure Virtual Network?](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview)

Azure Data Explorer supports deploying a cluster into a subnet in your Virtual Network (VNet). This capability enables you to:
* Enforce [Network Security Group](/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) (NSG) rules on your Azure Data Explorer cluster traffic.
* Connect your on-premises network to Azure Data Explorer cluster's subnet.
* Secure your data connection sources ([Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) and [Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/overview)) with [service endpoints](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview).
## Access your Azure Data Explorer cluster in your virtual network
You can access your Azure Data Explorer cluster using the following IP addresses for each service (engine and data management services):
* **Private IP**: Used for accessing the cluster inside the virtual network.
* **Public IP**: Used for accessing the cluster from outside the virtual network for management and monitoring, and as a source address for outbound connections started from the cluster.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The default NSG rules block access to public IP addresses outside the virtual network. To reach a public endpoint, you must add an exception for your public IP addresses in the NSG.
The following DNS records are created to access the service:
* `[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net` (engine) `ingest-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net` (data management) are mapped to the public IP for each service.
* `private-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net` (engine) `ingest-private-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net`\\`private-ingest-[clustername].[geo-region].kusto.windows.net` (data management) are mapped to the private IP for each service.
## Plan subnet size in your virtual network
The size of the subnet used to host an Azure Data Explorer cluster can't be altered after the subnet is deployed. In your virtual network, Azure Data Explorer uses one private IP address for each VM and two private IP addresses for the internal load balancers (engine and data management). Azure networking also uses five IP addresses for each subnet. Azure Data Explorer provisions two VMs for the data management service. Engine service VMs are provisioned per user configuration scale capacity.
The total number of IP addresses:
| Use | Number of addresses |
|--|--|
| Engine service | 1 per instance |
| Data management service | 2 |
| Internal load balancers | 2 |
| Azure reserved addresses | 5 |
| **Total** | **#engine_instances + 9** |
> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Make sure that you plan the subnet size before deploying Azure Data Explorer. Once deployed, the subnet size cannot be changed.
> - Make sure that you don't deploy any other Azure resources or services in the Subnet where you plan to deploy Azure Data Explorer. Doing so will prevent Azure Data Explorer starting when resuming from a suspended state.
## Service endpoints for connecting to Azure Data Explorer
[Azure Service Endpoints](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) enables you to secure your Azure multitenant resources to your virtual network.
Deploying the cluster into your subnet allows you to set up data connections with [Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) or [Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/overview) while restricting the underlying resources for Azure Data Explorer subnet.
## Private Endpoints
[Private Endpoints](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) allow private access to Azure resources (such as [storage/event hub](vnet-endpoint-storage-event-hub.md)/Data Lake Gen 2), and use private IP from your Virtual Network, effectively bringing the resource into your virtual network.
Create a [private endpoint](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) to resources used by data connections, such as event hub and storage, and external tables such as Storage, Data Lake Gen 2, and SQL Database from your virtual network to access the underlying resources privately.
 > [!NOTE]
 > Setting up Private Endpoint requires [configuring DNS](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-dns), We support [Azure Private DNS zone](/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone) setup only. Custom DNS server isn't supported.
## Configure Network Security Group rules
[NSGs](/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) give you the ability to control network access within a virtual network. You must configure NSGs for your Azure Data Explorer cluster to work in your virtual network.
### Configure Network Security Group rules using subnet delegation
[Subnet delegation](/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview) is the default method for configuring Network Security Group rules for Azure Data Explorer clusters deployed into a subnet in your virtual network. When using subnet delegation, you must delegate the subnet to *Microsoft.Kusto/clusters* before creating the cluster in the subnet.
By enabling subnet delegation on the cluster's subnet, you enable the service to define its pre-conditions for deployment in the form of Network Intent Policies. When creating the cluster in the subnet, the NSG configurations mentioned in the following sections are automatically created for you.
> [!WARNING]
> Changing your subnet delegation configuration will eventually disrupt the normal operation of your cluster. For example, after stopping the cluster you may not be able to start your cluster, run management commands, or apply health monitoring on your cluster.
### Configure Network Security Group rules manually
Alternatively, you can manually configure your NSG. By default, deploying a cluster into a virtual network enforces subnet delegation for "Microsoft.Kusto/clusters" to be configured. Opting out of this requirement is possible using the [Preview features](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Resources/PreviewFeaturesBlade) pane.
 > [!WARNING]
 > Manually configuring NSG rules for your cluster is not trivial and requires you to constantly monitor this article for changes. We highly recommended using subnet delegation for your cluster or, if you prefer, consider using a [Private Endpoint](security-network-private-endpoint.md) based solution.
#### Inbound NSG configuration

| Ports that are used for `sql\_request` and `http\_request` plugins | *YourAzureDataExplorerSubnet* | Internet:Custom | TCP |
The following sections list the relevant IP addresses for management and health monitoring.
> [!NOTE]
> You can disregard the following lists if your subnet is delegated to *Microsoft.Kusto/clusters* as described in [Configure Network Security Group rules using subnet delegation](#configure-network-security-group-rules-using-subnet-delegation). In this scenario, IP addresses may be not be up to date but will be automatically updated when the required NSG rules are assigned to the cluster.
#### Azure Data Explorer management IP addresses
> [!NOTE]
> For future deployments, use AzureDataExplorer Service Tag
