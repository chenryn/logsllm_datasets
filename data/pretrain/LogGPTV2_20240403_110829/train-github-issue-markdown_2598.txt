I am using Axios in my most of my react native projects but I have never met
this strange error. I am trying to do a post request to my server but it
always giving me Network Error. I tried to do with curl and it worked
perfectly and I also tried to visit the IP address from my mobile using a
browser and it worked there too. When I try to run the server locally it works
perfectly (via reverse TCP)
