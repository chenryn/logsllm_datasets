I frequently use Axios in my React Native projects, but I've recently encountered a peculiar issue. When attempting to send a POST request to my server, I consistently receive a "Network Error." However, when I use `curl` to make the same request, it works without any issues. Additionally, I can successfully access the server's IP address from my mobile browser. Furthermore, running the server locally and accessing it via reverse TCP also works perfectly.

Could you please help me identify what might be causing this "Network Error" with Axios?
