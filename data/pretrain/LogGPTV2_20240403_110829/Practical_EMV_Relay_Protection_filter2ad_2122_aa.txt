from a locked iPhone to any EMV shop reader (with non-
transit merchant codes), for any amount; we tested up to
£1000. For Mastercard, we found that relays from locked
phones were only possible to readers with a transit merchant
code. We formally model these protocols and verify the results,
using the Tamarin prover; we extend the state-of-the-art EMV
models from [2] to support mobile apps in different modes.
We disclosed this attack to both Apple and Visa, and
discussed it with their security teams. Apple suggested that
the best solution was for Visa to implement additional fraud
detection checks, explicitly checking Issuer Application Data
(IAD) and the Merchant Category Code (MCC). Meanwhile,
Visa observed that the issue only applied to Apple (i.e., not
Samsung Pay), so suggested that a ﬁx should be made to
Apple Pay. We verify Apple’s and Visa’s possible solutions
in Tamarin and show that either would limit the impact of
relaying. At the time of writing neither side has implemented
a ﬁx, so the Apple Pay Visa vulnerability remains live.
We found that Samsung Pay did not use “magic bytes”,
instead it was always possible to perform an EMV transac-
tion with a locked Samsung phone. However, we found that
locked Samsung-Pay would only allow a zero-value payment,
requiring the transport providers (currently only TfL) to have
an arrangement with their banks to charge for tickets based
on these zero value transactions. This makes it impossible to
relay Samsung Pay to shop readers to buy goods, but it is still
possible to relay Samsung Pay to other transport readers.
It seems unlikely that transport modes will be removed from
phones so, as relaying attacks are still possible, there is a need
for general EMV relay-countermeasures. Visa have proposed a
relay-countermeasure [3]; their protocol binds the ISO 14443
Level 1 data to the Level 3 protocol on the presumption
that (relay) attackers cannot easily tamper with Level 1 data.
This protocol has yet to be fully speciﬁed and implemented.
Mastercard speciﬁcations include a Relay Resistance Protocol
(RRP) [1]. This has been in the speciﬁcations since 2016, but
as far as we are aware it is not yet implemented in commercial
readers, or on customers’ cards. RRP operates at the EMV
application layer. In this protocol, the reader times a nonce
exchange with the card. If the time taken to communicate
with the card is within the bounds provided by the card, it is
likely that the card is close to the reader and no relay attack
is taking place. If the time taken is outside these bounds then
the nonce exchange is repeated. If three nonce exchanges fail,
then payment is rejected as a possible relay.

Abstract—Relay attackers can forward messages between a
contactless EMV bank card and a shop reader, making it possible
to wirelessly pickpocket money. To protect against this, Apple Pay
requires a user’s ﬁngerprint or Face ID to authorise payments,
while Mastercard and Visa have proposed protocols to stop such
relay attacks. We investigate transport payment modes and ﬁnd
that we can build on relaying to bypass the Apple Pay lock screen,
and illicitly pay from a locked iPhone to any EMV reader, for
any amount, without user authorisation. We show that Visa’s
proposed relay-countermeasure can be bypassed using rooted
smart phones. We analyse Mastercard’s relay protection, and
show that its timing bounds could be more reliably imposed at
the ISO 14443 protocol level, rather than at the EMV protocol
level. With these insights, we propose a new relay-resistance
protocol (L1RP) for EMV. We use the Tamarin prover to model
mobile-phone payments with and without user authentication,
and in different payment modes. We formally verify solutions to
our attack suggested by Apple and Visa, and used by Samsung,
and we verify that our proposed protocol provides protection
from relay attacks.
I. INTRODUCTION
Contactless Europay, Mastercard, and Visa (EMV) pay-
ments are a fast and easy way to make payments and are
increasingly becoming a standard way to pay. However, if
payments can be made with no user input,
this increases
the attack surface for adversaries and especially for relay
attackers, who can ferry messages between cards and readers
without the owner’s knowledge, enabling fraudulent payments.
Payments via smart-phone apps generally have to be conﬁrmed
by a user via a ﬁngerprint, PIN code, or Face ID. This makes
relay attacks less of a threat.
Apple Pay uses the EMV standard, however, for usability,
iOS 12.3 (May 2019) introduced the “Express Transit/Travel”
feature that allows Apple Pay to be used at a transport-ticketing
barrier station without unlocking the phone. In October 2019,
Samsung introduced the same feature. We refer to this feature
as “Transport mode”. We found that a non-standard sequence
of bytes is broadcast by Transport for London (TfL) ticket-gate
readers, and that these “magic bytes” bypass the Apple Pay
lock screen. Apple Pay then checks that its other requirements
are met (different for Visa and Mastercard) and if so it allows
a transaction to be performed with no user interaction.
For Apple Pay Visa we alter, replay and relay both ISO
14443 Level 11 messages, as well as EMV protocol Level 3
messages; with this, we are able to make a fraudulent payment
1In EMV terminology [1], Level 1 is the ISO 14443 protocol, Level 2 is
the exchange of bytes encoded as Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs),
and Level 3 corresponds to the EMV application protocol. We cover the ISO
14443 protocol in Appendix A and the EMV protocol in Section II-A. We do
not manipulate the APDUs and so they are not detailed further.
We show that the previously proposed relay-protection pro-
tocol from Visa can be defeated with standard hardware: the
Level 1 data they bind into Level 3 can be forged. The Level 1

data used comes only from the card, without involvement
from, or timing by, the reader. This leaves the protocol open
to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. When contacted, Visa
stated that their proposal provides protection against off-the-
shelf smart phone relays. However, we show that a replay/relay
is possible with standard phones, if one of them is rooted.
To test the Mastercard RRP, we measured the timings of
responses coming from a test RRP-capable card, provided by
ICC Solutions, as well as a range of other payment cards.
We ﬁnd that the distance of the card from the reader has a
noticeable effect on the response times for the card’s Level 3
messages, including the timed nonce-exchange on the RRP
card. The Level 1 messages, which require less processing,
show much shorter and more consistent response times. As
users will commonly place payment cards at a range of
distances and angles from the reader, it may be difﬁcult for
the reader to tell the difference between a card at the optimum
position being relayed, and a legitimate card in the worst
position. In the case of our test RRP-capable card, we show
that this difference is enough to make a relay possible. While
other card implementations may have regular enough timing
to make a relay more difﬁcult, relays are also becoming faster,
even with cheap off-the-shelf hardware [4]. Requiring the user
to place their card in a ﬁxed position would mitigate this
problem, but it would not be a usable solution.
We propose the L1RP protocol that combines elements from
both Visa’s and Mastercard’s relay protections. We leverage
the timed nonce-exchange as proposed by Mastercard, yet we
move it to the ISO 14443 Level 1 part of the EMV protocol,
which –as we show– gives stable round trip time (RTT)
measurements. From Visa, we take the idea of tying together
data from Level 1 with the EMV application authentication.
By having a nonce-exchange and not just a one-directional
message as in Visa’s case, we solve the replay/relay issue with
Visa’s proposal. Our L1RP protocol satisﬁes the requirements
of the ISO 14443 speciﬁcations and can be made backwards
compatible, allowing both cards and readers to complete a
transaction with a legacy reader or card (i.e., one without our
relay protection).
We formally verify our L1RP protocol, and prove it se-
cure using Tamarin. For relay-security, we rely on a pre-
viously published method in [5]. Concretely, we show that
no downgrade attacks (to the EMV protocol without relay
protection) are possible, and that our design provides the relay
protection, as described in the threat model section below. We
also implement our protocol’s Level 1 nonce-exchange using
Proxmarks [6], providing some evidence that our protocol is
practical.
Novelty & Positioning: There have been a range of
attacks against contactless EMV (e.g., [7], [2], [8]). Most of
these attacks make use of a relay to alter messages going
between a card and a reader, i.e., the relay aspect of our
work is not new. However, we note that (1) None, of these
past attacks work against EMV payments from mobile devices
that require strong user-authentication, (2) None of these past
attacks would work if good relay-protection protocols were
in place, and we are the ﬁrst to show that neither Visa, nor
Mastercard’s current relay-protection solutions are reliable.
Our work on mobile payments and transit modes adds im-
portant new insights to the ﬁeld. For instance, Basin et. al. [2]
present an attack that bypasses the contactless-transaction limit
for Visa plastic cards by making it look like the card has
used user authentication (CDCVM) when the card is not even
capable of it, and they suggest changes to Visa’s protocol to ﬁx
this. However, we show that the CDCVM status of a capable
device is recorded in the IAD ﬁeld in Visa’s protocol, and this
ﬁeld may be authenticated by the bank, so all Visa need to
do to stop this attack is to check this existing ﬁeld in their
protocol. So, we delay discussion of related work until the
end of the paper, after we have presented our new ﬁndings.
The contributions of this paper are:
1) Explaining how Transit/Transport mode and the Issuer
Application Data work and are used in EMV.
2) Showing how to bypass the Apple Pay lock screen take
any amount of money from a Visa on an iPhone.
3) Showing that Visa’s Level 1-relay-protected protocol is
insecure against an attacker with rooted phones
4) Showing that EMV distance bounding can be done more
reliability at Level 1 than Level 3.
5) Proposing a Level 1 distance bounding protocol for EMV.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Overview of EMV
The EMV standard includes many different protocols, with
many variations. We present the versions of Mastercard’s Pay-
Pass and Visa’s PayWave that we observed in mobile phone
transaction traces. All of the annotated traces we collected can
be found in [9]. We summarise the most important acronyms
used by EMV in Appendix D.
1) Mastercard’s Protocol: The version of PayPass we
observed is shown in Fig 1. It runs after the Level 1 ISO
14443-3 anti-collision protocol; the relevant parts of the ISO
14443 protocol are described in Appendix A.
The card and the bank share a symmetric key KM , and
the card has a certiﬁcate chain for a public key, which the
reader can verify. The ﬁrst two messages exchanged select the
payment application (i.e., Mastercard). Next, the reader sends a
Get Processing Options (GPO) message with terminal-speciﬁc
information, and the payment device answers with a list of the
records available on the card (the Application File Locator
(AFL)) and a list of the card’s capabilities (the Application
Interchange Proﬁle (AIP)). The AIP indicates whether the
device is capable of user authentication, but does not indicate
whether user authentication has actually been used.
The reader will then request all of the records listed in
the AFL, which includes “Track 2” (the user’s account in-
formation) and the Card Risk Management Data Object List 1
(CDOL1), which lists all of the information the card needs to
complete the transaction. The information requested may vary
between cards; however, for mobile devices using Mastercard
this always includes the amount of the transaction, a unique
number/nonce from the reader (Unpredictable Number (UN))
