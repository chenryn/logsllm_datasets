**Current behavior**
Not sure if this is a bug or a feature request, but PI:EMAIL
suggested me to file an issue.  
When there is a list of primitives, let say booleans `let list: Array
= [true, true, false, true]`, *ngFor is not capable to track it correctly.
It's clear from documentation, that it is required to use some tracking
function, but it looks overkilled to implement a tracking function that looks
like this:
    track(i: number): number {
      return i;
    }
**Expected behavior**
Is it possible to add a predefined variable `index` as a tracking parameter?  
`*ngFor="let item of list; let i = index; trackBy: index"`

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Get rid of unnecessary tracking function.
