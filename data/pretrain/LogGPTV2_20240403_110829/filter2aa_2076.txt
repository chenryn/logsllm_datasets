WarBallooning Concept
 Thanks for coming!
 WarDriving limited visibility in the city
 $4.00 / Gallon gas means driving less
 Balloon – better platform than rocket
 Perfect for covering 5 - 10 mile Urban
Areas
 Questions during talk welcome…

 New Platform:
Balloon vs. Rocket
 The Rocket was a novel concept, but…
– Explosives permits req’d
– Launch only in rural areas
– Stumbling limited to parachute drift time
 Balloon
– Helium cost $20/ lb. payload lift
– More accepted by authorities
– Still restricted near airports

IP Based Robotics
 DLINK 5220 consists of a CCD camera,
web server, and pan & tilt controller
 As the Pan motor is quite strong, we’re
using it to aim the high gain antenna @
stumbling targets
 Speed, camera focus, snapshots, MPEG
video’s all controllable via the web-
interface

Network Sketch
Balloon Network
• WRT54G – Passive Monitoring Only, Data
streamed to Kismet Server on ground Hard
Drive (HD)
 DLINK 5220 Camera & AP:
– Web Server used to Control Camera & Antenna
Movement
– Camera AP -> Disabled
– Video Streamed -> Ground  HD
– Verizon Aircard –> Possible EVDO link to Internet
– Cell phone Browsing of  Aerial Pics
Balloon Network - Security
 Security Considerations:
– Closed Network - Fiber Optic Transmission
– SSH  & Certificates – Command Line
Access to WRT54G
– AP Not Possible in Drone Mode (IDS)
– DDNS Use
Flying the WarBalloon
 Biggest Challenge:
– Not building the WarBalloon
– FAA Approval
 Letter to Las Vegas Terminal Radar
Approach Control (TRACON)
Flying the WarBalloon
 Subject:  Proposed Balloon Display over the Riviera Hotel.
 Sent By:  PI:EMAIL    On: May 12, 2008
 To: PI:EMAIL      (FAA Las Vegas ATC)
Sir:  Thanks for taking time to talk to me (FRI) concerning FAA
regulations for Moored Balloons. As we discussed, my group
would like to fly a Balloon during the annual DEFCON convention
to be held at the Riviera Convention Center, AUG 8-10, 2008. We
understand that safety is of paramount importance as the Riviera
is located < 5 miles from Las Vegas Airport (LAS).
As you requested, following is the Balloon Description & Tentative
Operating Plan:  Balloon to be flown is a maximum 6 ft. diameter
unit with a 113 cu. ft. Helium capacity, (to be purchased from
Southern Balloon Works.  Note this is a commercial advertising
Balloon similar to the ones flown by Car Dealerships…
Flying the WarBalloon
 Operation:  the Balloon (unmanned) is to be moored via the
supplied tether line from the edge of the Riviera convention
center, monitored at all times, and flown at less than 150 ft. AGL,
daylight operation only.  Balloon will have a 3.5 lb. payload. For
safety it is equipped with a self-deploying parachute capable of
lowering the payload gently to the ground in case of Balloon
failure (bursting.)  You also mentioned that nearby building
heights could be important:  I did some research & found that
Turnberry Towers - (adjacent to our flight location) comes in at
477 ft., while Wynn down the street in the other direction is 614 ft.
in height.
If you would, please review our plan and let us know if you think
the proposed operation is feasible, (& legal per FAA 101
regulations.) Appreciate your time and any advice you can offer.
Regards,
Rick Hill

 OK, so a Laptop & Lawn Chair did come
to mind.  (I do NOT recommend)

Summary
 Aerial platforms do provide superior LOS to
WIFI targets.
 Wind is not your friend:
– No Wind: perfect for directional antenna
– 5 MPH:    OK
– 10 MPH:  Use the OMNI
– 15 MPH: Forget It!
 DEFCON Results: TBD
