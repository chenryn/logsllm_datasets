## Abstract
In traditional IT environments, communication between physical servers is controlled by specialized machines that manage network traffic based on address information. With the advent of hypervisors, which virtualize and distribute IT resources, the industry has continued to rely on address-based control, despite the potential for more intelligent and secure methods. This paper identifies the limitations of current secure network virtualization practices and proposes a new approach that leverages the capabilities of hypervisors to work with the identities of virtualized IT resources. By integrating cryptographic techniques, this approach enhances the security and control of network virtualization, enabling applications such as secure multi-tenancy in cloud computing.

## Introduction
Cloud computing is fundamentally a multi-tenant environment, where compute, storage, and network resources are shared among multiple client organizations (tenants). Virtualization is the key technology that enables resource sharing, and ensuring secure multi-tenancy requires enhancing security in virtualized environments. In this position paper, we focus on the challenges and opportunities in secure network virtualization.

To illustrate the problem, consider the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend, where employees use personal devices at work. While BYOD can provide cost savings and attract tech-savvy employees, it also raises significant security concerns, such as data leakage, malware, and intrusions. Traditional approaches to securing BYOD, such as scanning and inspecting the software environment of employee devices, may be ineffective and intrusive.

### CPU Virtualization and Network Security
CPU virtualization technologies, like VMware Workstation, can create isolated computing environments. For example, an employer can set up a guest OS on an employee's device, which is owned and managed by the employer, while the host OS remains under the employee's control. However, this setup faces a critical challenge: the network traffic from the guest OS is still routed through the host OS, making it difficult to differentiate and secure the traffic.

### The Power of Cryptography in Secure Network Virtualization
Cryptography can enable secure network virtualization by allowing the creation of a secure communication channel between the guest OS and the organization. For instance, the hypervisor can use identity data within the guest OS to establish an IPsec tunnel with the organization. This ensures that the payload data from the guest OS is protected, preventing the host OS from forging or accessing it. The result is a clear separation of the physical network into two virtual networks: one for the guest OS and one for the host OS.

## Network Virtualization for Secure Multi-tenancy in Cloud Computing: Problem Identification
Cloud computing is a service-oriented model where tenants expect all technical and security aspects to be managed by the cloud provider. This includes firewall configuration, virus control, intrusion detection, and data loss prevention. Tenants should not be burdened with these responsibilities, and the phrase "Security as a Service" aptly describes this expectation.

Moreover, in today's interconnected world, cloud computing should support a distributed and hybrid model. Tenants may choose to use multiple cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure redundancy. This necessitates robust and secure virtualization technologies to manage and protect the distributed resources.

### Conclusion
By leveraging the intelligence and distributed power of hypervisors, and integrating cryptographic techniques, we can significantly enhance the security and effectiveness of network virtualization. This approach not only addresses the limitations of current practices but also opens up new possibilities for secure multi-tenancy in cloud computing.
