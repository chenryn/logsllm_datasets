 When turning ON/OFF Secure Boot, it should change 
Hmm.. but there is no SecureBootEnable variable 
 Where does the BIOS store Secure Boot Enable flag? 
Should be NV  somewhere in SPI Flash.. 
 Just dump SPI flash with Secure Boot ON and OFF

Issue was co-discovered with Corey Kallenberg, Xeno Kovah, John Butterworth and Sam Cornwell from MITRE 
All Your Boot Are Belong To Us, Setup for Failure: Defeating SecureBoot 
Demo 
(Bypassing Secure Boot via Image Verification Policies) 
How To Avoid These? 
1.
Do not store critical Secure Boot configuration in UEFI variables 
accessible to potentially compromised OS kernel or boot loader 
Remove RUNTIME_ACCESS attribute (reduce access permissions) 
Use authenticated variable where required by UEFI Spec 
Disabling Secure Boot requires physically present user 
2.
Set Image Verification Policies to secure values 
Use Platform Configuration Database (PCD) for the policies 
Using ALWAYS_EXECUTE,ALLOW_EXECUTE_* is a bad idea 
Especially check PcdOptionRomImageVerificationPolicy 
Default should be NEVER_EXECUTE or DENY_EXECUTE 
Recap on Image Verification Handler 
SecureBoot EFI variable doesn’t exist or equals to 
SECURE_BOOT_MODE_DISABLE? EFI_SUCCESS 
File is not valid PE/COFF image? EFI_ACCESS_DENIED 
SecureBootEnable NV EFI variable doesn’t exist or equals to 
SECURE_BOOT_DISABLE? EFI_SUCCESS 
SetupMode NV EFI variable doesn’t exist or equals to SETUP_MODE? 
EFI_SUCCESS 
EFI Executables 
 Any EFI executables other then PE/COFF? 
 YES! – EFI Byte Code (EBC), Terse Executable (TE) 
 But EBC image is a 32 bits PE/COFF image wrapping byte 
code. No luck  
 Terse Executable format: 
   In an effort to reduce image size, a new executable image header (TE) 
was created that includes only those fields from the PE/COFF headers 
required for execution under the PI Architecture. Since this header 
contains the information required for execution of the image, it can 
replace the PE/COFF headers from the original image.  
 http://wiki.phoenix.com/wiki/index.php/Terse_Executable_Format  
TE is not PE/COFF 
 TE differs from PE/COFF only with header: 
PE/TE Header Handling by the BIOS 
 Decoded UEFI BIOS image from SPI Flash 
PE/TE Header Handling by the BIOS 
CORE_DXE.efi: 
PE/TE Header Confusion 
 ExecuteSecurityHandler calls GetFileBuffer to 
read an executable file.  
 GetFileBuffer reads the file and checks it to have a valid 
PE header. It returns EFI_LOAD_ERROR if executable is not 
PE/COFF. 
 ExecuteSecurityHandler returns EFI_SUCCESS (0) 
in case GetFileBuffer returns an error 
 Signature Checks are Skipped! 
PE/TE Header Confusion 
BIOS allows running TE images w/o signature check 
 Malicious PE/COFF EFI executable (bootkit.efi) 
 Convert executable to TE format by replacing PE/COFF 
header with TE header 
 Replace OS boot loaders with resulting TE EFI executable 
 Signature check is skipped for TE EFI executable 
 Executable will load and patch original OS boot loader 
Demo 
(Secure Boot Bypass via PE/TE Header Confusion) 
Other Secure Boot Problems 
• CSM Module Allows Legacy On UEFI Based Firmware 
• Allows Legacy OS Boot Through [Unsigned] MBR 
• Allows Loading Legacy [Unsigned] Option ROMs 
• Once CSM is ON, UEFI BIOS dispatches legacy OROMs then boots MBR 
• CSM Cannot Be Turned On When Secure Boot is Enabled 
• CSM can be turned On/Off in BIOS Setup Options 
• But cannot select “CSM Enabled” when Secure Boot is On 
CSM Enabled with Secure Boot 
• Force CSM to Disabled if Secure Boot is Enabled 
• But don’t do that only in Setup HII 
• Implement isCSMEnabled() function always returning FALSE in Secure Boot 
• Never fall back to legacy boot through MBR if Secure Boot verification of UEFI 
executable fails 
Mitigations 
Clearing Platform Key… from Software 
“Clear Secure Boot keys” takes effect after reboot 
 Switch that triggers clearing of Secure Boot keys is in UEFI 
Variable (happens to be in ‘Setup’ variable) 
But recall that Secure Boot is OFF without Platform Key 
PK is cleared  Secure Boot is Disabled 
Install Default Keys… From Where? 
Default Secure Boot keys can be restored [When there’s no PK] 
Switch that triggers restore of Secure Boot keys to their default 
values is in UEFI Variable (happens to be in ‘Setup’) 
Nah.. Default keys are protected. They are in FV 
But we just added 9 hashes to the DBX blacklist  
Did You Notice Secure Boot Config. Changed? 
The system protects Secure Boot configuration from modification but has 
an implementation bug 
Firmware stores integrity of Secure Boot settings & checks on reboot 
Upon integrity mismatch, beeps 3 times, waits timeout then… 
Keeps booting with modified Secure Boot settings

Do BIOS Attacks Require Kernel Privileges? 
To attack BIOS, exploit 
needs access to HW: 
PCIe config, 
I/O ports, 
physical memory, 
etc. 
So, generally, yes. 
Kernel privileges are 
required..
