The EAR(1) process, detailed below, exhibits correlated inter-arrival times with an exponential marginal distribution. For brevity, specific parameter settings are omitted. Figure 1 presents results for various probing streams, all sharing the same average inter-probe interval and using zero-sized probes. This ensures that there is no intrusiveness—probes do not impact the system—and no inversion, as we directly measure the desired metric. Therefore, sampling bias can be analyzed in isolation.

In Figure 1, the grey curve on the left shows the true Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the delay of zero-sized probes, calculated from Equation (2). As expected, the CDF for Poisson probes aligns with the true CDF, confirming the applicability of PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) to this system. Interestingly, the other five probing schemes also closely match the true CDF. In this non-intrusive scenario, the lack of sampling bias observed with Poisson probing is shared by many other probing methods. The right plot in Figure 1 further supports this, showing that the estimated delays agree with the true values in each case. In Section 3, we will prove that a broad class of processes shares this desirable property, even for more complex systems than the simple M/M/1 queue.

Figure 2 examines the same probing arrival streams but allows the probes to have a non-zero service time \( x \) (for simplicity, \( x \) is constant, though this is not essential). This introduces intrusiveness, as the probes now affect the system's load and more detailed characteristics. To avoid dealing with inversion issues, our goal is to determine the true delay of the full system, combining cross-traffic and non-virtual probes, for a packet with service time \( x \). In other words, we aim to measure the same metric we have direct access to through probing.

The mean estimates in the right-hand plot of Figure 2 show that each probing stream results in different system behavior (despite equal loads), and each now provides a biased estimate of its respective \( E[D] \), except for Poisson. Thus, PASTA continues to hold, while the other probing schemes, which were unbiased when \( x = 0 \), now exhibit bias due to intrusiveness. The corresponding CDFs in the left-hand plot provide a more detailed view of how the systems differ for each stream and how the bias varies with delay. These results illustrate that PASTA holds in the intrusive case. In Section 4, we will state the general conditions under which PASTA can be expected to hold.

Next, we study inversion bias in isolation by using only Poisson streams, which have zero sampling bias in all cases. We set the probe service time \( X \) to be exponentially distributed with the same parameter \( \mu_T \) as the cross-traffic packets. This results in a probe+traffic system that remains M/M/1, with rate \( \lambda = \lambda_T + \lambda_P \) and average service time \( \mu_T \), allowing the use of Equation (1).

Figure 3 illustrates the significant fact that increasing the probing load by increasing \( \lambda_P \) causes the overall system to deviate increasingly from the original unperturbed system where \( \lambda_P = 0 \). Consequently, even if an estimate of the true mean (or CDF) is unbiased, it is an estimate of the full (probe + cross-traffic) system, not the unperturbed (cross-traffic only) system. Thus, "what we want is not what we directly measure." To obtain the unperturbed delay from the perturbed one requires a separate inversion step, which is highly non-trivial even in this simple example. For other common active probing objectives, such as using packet-pair methods to estimate bottleneck bandwidth, the required inversion and its potential impact are even greater. Another way to see this is that probes sent as a Poisson process at the sender will not arrive as a Poisson process at the bottleneck link in general and will also be affected by their onward passage from that link to the receiver. Thus, the probes are "sampling" the bottleneck link, but not in a Poisson manner and not in isolation.

We make two contributions to the inversion issue. First, we highlight that inversion can be extremely challenging and, more importantly, is a generic difficulty for which PASTA offers no solution. Indeed, it has been shown recently [10] that, even in a simple 1-hop system, unless the cross-traffic follows specific restrictive assumptions, full knowledge of the cross-traffic process feeding the hop is unobservable. In such cases, strict inversion is impossible even in principle, corresponding to an extreme form of the inversion problem related to fundamental issues of system non-identifiability, which PASTA cannot mitigate. Second, despite these difficulties, there is a general approach, the rare probing of Theorem 4, to address inversion bias in the intrusive case, which we explore in Section 4.

### Bias versus Variance

In Section 2.1, we focused on the bias of estimators based on a simple average of delays experienced by probes. In this section, we examine the variance of these estimators. When bias is non-zero, we consider the tradeoff between bias and variance using the mean squared error (MSE) formula: \( \text{MSE} = \text{bias}^2 + \text{variance} \).

So far, we have considered cross-traffic packets arriving as a Poisson process. However, in general, cross-traffic will interact with probe traffic in ways that depend on the correlation or "burstiness" structure of each, and estimation variance will be a function of these interactions. To clearly demonstrate this, we need a richer context than the simple memoryless structure of the Poisson process. We use the Exponential (first-order) AutoRegressive process (EAR(1)) [5] to generate a point process for CT arrivals with a well-defined correlation time scale \( \tau^* \), below which autocorrelation is significant but above which it decays rapidly to zero. Like the Poisson process, it consists of exponentially distributed inter-arrival times, but with a correlation structure.

Figure 4 shows the bias and variance of delay with correlated cross-traffic in the non-intrusive case (\( x = 0 \)). The left plot displays the bias of mean estimates seen by different probing streams as a function of the EAR(1) parameter \( \alpha \) of the cross-traffic, using 100,000 probes. The right plot shows the corresponding estimates of standard deviation. Although all probing schemes are unbiased, their variances differ, and Poisson is not the smallest.

Figure 5 further explores the bias and variance of delay in the intrusive case. The left plot shows the bias of mean estimates as a function of the load ratio (probe load/cross-traffic load) for various probing schemes. The right plot shows the corresponding estimates of standard deviation. These results highlight the tradeoffs between bias and variance in the presence of correlated cross-traffic and varying probe loads.
