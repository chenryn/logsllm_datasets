### Location and Altitude

The fission chamber counter must be deactivated when the server is out of the beam to prevent underestimation of the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF).

### Confidence Intervals of MTTF Induced by Neutron Flux

**Table 3. Confidence intervals of MTTF induced by the neutron flux (a.u. – arbitrary units)**

| Confidence Level | 80%           | 90%           |
|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 20 upsets        | 52, 103 a.u.  | 44, 110 a.u.  |
| 30 upsets        | 56, 97 a.u.   | 50, 103 a.u.  |
| 40 upsets        | 58, 91 a.u.   | 53, 96 a.u.   |

Note: The calculations in this study are based on [17]. It is important to note that MTTF decreases significantly with altitude due to the shielding effect of the Earth's atmosphere and varies slightly with geographical location due to the Earth's magnetic field. Annex E of [17] provides two procedures for calculating the cosmic-ray-induced neutron flux at any altitude and location.

### Experimental Results

This section presents the results of neutron Single Event Rate (SER) characterization of Intel Itanium® microprocessors. The experiments were conducted using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and a Linpack benchmark [3]. Although the Linpack benchmark is designed to measure the performance of matrix computations, it also calculates residues, which can capture possible numerical errors, such as silent data corruption. Square matrices of sizes 1000 and 800 were used in the experiments. All runs were interrupted by upsets (failures) induced by the neutron flux, meaning the number of runs equaled the number of failures. The main types of failures observed were blue screens and server hangs.

Figure 3 illustrates the MTTF as a function of the number of runs. Each data point, representing an MTTF value, is derived using Equation (1). Fcp and U increase with the number of runs, while Nc and Nf remain constant. Significant variations in the MTTF calculated after the Linpack benchmark were observed, attributed to the wide range of run durations, from about 10 seconds to 5 minutes. Consequently, MTTF stabilizes only after approximately 40 runs (Figure 3).

Table 3 shows the 80% and 90% confidence intervals of MTTF after 20, 30, and 40 upsets (failures). As expected, the confidence intervals narrow as the number of upsets increases. For example, after 40 upsets, we are 80% confident that the MTTF lies within the (58, 91) interval. Experiments may be terminated when the MTTF confidence interval is sufficiently narrow for the desired confidence level.

Only one silent data corruption (SDC) event was observed, which is not statistically significant for determining the frequency of SDC. No latch-up events occurred during the experiments.

The experimental results discussed here are specific to terrestrial operating conditions. In space environments, heavy ions and proton radiation are commonly used for SER characterization, resulting in significantly lower microprocessor MTTF. Detailed SER evaluation techniques and estimated failure rates for space applications are provided in [18].

### Conclusions

This report has discussed the impact of semiconductor technology scaling on neutron-induced SER and described the technique used for SER characterization of the Intel Itanium® microprocessor. Accelerated measurements conducted at LANSCE provided statistically significant estimates of the MTTF due to high-energy neutrons.

**Footnote:**
- Blue screens provide limited information on error type and location. No error data is available in the case of server hangs.

### Future Directions

As the level of integration and complexity in integrated circuits, particularly microprocessors, continues to increase, so does their sensitivity to particle-induced errors. Techniques for fault avoidance and fault tolerance are expected to become more prevalent. Silicon on Insulator (SOI), especially fully depleted SOI, has proven to be an effective fault avoidance solution [1, 5]. Triple-well [4, 24, 31] and circuit design [13, 38, 40] also reduce sensitivity to high-energy particles. Fault tolerance techniques, such as space redundancy [2, 6, 33] and time redundancy (primarily multithreading [28, 29, 30]), are gaining traction. Reducing instruction vulnerability time [37] and reusing designs to lower SER [23] are also expected to become more common. Firmware and software recovery [27], along with error detecting and correcting codes [7, 8, 11, 19, 21], will continue to expand.

As the impact of soft errors becomes more significant, both manufacturers and customers need accurate SER measurements. Manufacturers need to characterize their products from a SER standpoint to validate pre-silicon, model-based estimates and compare new designs against competitors and previous products. Users, on the other hand, need to choose from a wide range of products that employ different circuit design techniques and manufacturing processes. As a result, accelerated SER measurements are becoming an important element of dependability benchmarking. The approach presented in this report can be used for characterizing microprocessors and other complex semiconductor devices, without requiring proprietary data about the circuits under evaluation, making it accessible to independent evaluators.
