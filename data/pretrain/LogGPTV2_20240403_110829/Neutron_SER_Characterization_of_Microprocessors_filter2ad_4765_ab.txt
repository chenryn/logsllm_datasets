significantly decreases with altitude (earth atmosphere
plays a shielding role) and slightly varies with
geographical location (due to earth magnetic field).
Two procedures for calculating the cosmic-ray induced
neutron flux, at an arbitrary altitude and location, are
provided in Annex E of [17].
4. Experimental results
The results of neutron SER characterization of the
Intel Itanium® microprocessors are presented herein.
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and a Linpack benchmark
[3] were running on the server. Although designed to
measure performance of matrix computations,
this
benchmark also derives the residues. The value of the

Figure 3 shows the MTTF as a function of the
number of runs. Each data point, i.e. MTTF value, is
derived using Equation (1). Fcp and U are increasing
with the number of runs, while Nc and Nf remain
constant. Significant
the MTTF,
calculated after
Linpack
benchmark, were observed. This is explained by the
fact that duration of each run varied in a very wide
range, from about 10 sec to 5 min. As a result, MTTF
approaches a stable value only after 40 runs (Figure 3).
Table 3 shows the 80% and 90% confidence intervals
of MTTF, after 20, 30 and 40 upsets (failures). As
expected, the confidence intervals are narrowing as the
number of upsets, i.e. the duration of the experiment,
increases. An example of interpreting data in Table 3
is: after 40 upsets we are 80% confident that MTTF is
in the (58, 91) interval. Experiments may be stopped
when MTTF confidence interval is considered narrow
enough for the desired confidence level.
Only one silent data corruption (SDC) event was
observed. This unique event cannot provide statistically
significant data on the frequency of occurrence of SDC.
No latch-up events occurred.
Experimental results discussed in this section are
specific to terrestrial operating conditions. Heavy ions
and proton radiation are commonly used for SER
characterization in a space environment. Significantly
lower microprocessor MTTF is observed in that case.
Details on SER evaluation techniques and estimated
failure rates,
specific to space applications, are
provided in [18].
