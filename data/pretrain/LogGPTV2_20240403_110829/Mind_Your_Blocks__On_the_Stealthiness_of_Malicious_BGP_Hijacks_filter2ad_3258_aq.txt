Spammers have access to automated tools that facilitate the creation of new email templates and automate the registration of new domains, which are used for disposable, one-time URLs. Figure 9(7) provides a visual representation of a large-scale spam campaign involving multiple hijacked IP prefixes, illustrating the typical modus operandi of agile spammers operating such stealthy campaigns. Key observations from this example include:

- Over 662 spam emails were sent from 12 different hijacked IP prefixes (represented by yellow nodes). Each prefix was used in turn to distribute spam using a series of one-time URLs, most of which included domain names (blue nodes) registered at ENOM (large pink node) with privacy-protected email addresses provided by whoisprivacyprotect.com (red nodes).
- The URLs advertised in the spam emails shared the same server IP addresses (light grey nodes).
- The campaign lasted for 84 days, but only 24 of those days were active (purple nodes laid out in a clockwise fashion). During these active days, spammers frequently switched between hijacked IP prefixes, effectively circumventing IP-based spam filters and reputation systems.

To our knowledge, these findings provide a novel insight into the behavior of agile BGP hijacking spammers. First, we observe that stealthy spam campaigns can be conducted by exploiting multiple hijacked IP address blocks. Secondly, the same invalid direct upstream providers were involved in all these hijacks, suggesting potential countermeasures. Finally, all URLs advertised in spam emails share a common hosting infrastructure and were registered in a similar manner, indicating that WHOIS registration data could be leveraged in prevention systems. This root cause analysis enables us to link different hijacked prefixes, showing they are used by the same spamming actors over an extended period in a highly covert manner.

### Summary

**Finding 1:**
We identified two types of hijack phenomena: long-lived and short-lived. Long-lived hijacks can persist from a week to several months, while short-lived hijacks last from a few minutes to several days.

**Finding 2:**
Attackers were found to stealthily hijack properly registered but unannounced IP address space using two different techniques: prefix hijacking and AS hijacking. In prefix hijacking, the attacker announces an IP address block using an invalid BGP origin AS via a valid direct upstream provider (first hop) AS. In AS hijacking, the attacker announces an IP address block using a valid BGP origin AS but via an invalid direct upstream provider (first hop) AS.

**Finding 3:**
In the 2,454 prefix hijacks, we found only six different invalid BGP origin ASes. In the 201 AS hijacks, for 195 different valid BGP origin ASes, only three different invalid upstream provider ASes were observed. One AS, involved in the hijack of 793 IP address blocks over 16 months, was first seen as an invalid upstream provider AS and then as an invalid BGP origin AS. These 793 hijacks were later confirmed by the ISP providing transit to that AS, who subsequently terminated the contract with the abusive customer.

**Finding 4:**
Using hijacked IP prefixes for spamming appears to be an effective technique for evading known protections.
