Transceiver latency plays an important role in our implementa-
tion. It is required to determine the turnaround time for the receiver
at the broadcast node. Usually for any practical transceiver, the
minimum time that is required for the MAC/PHY to receive the
last symbol of a frame at the air interface process the frame and
respond with the ﬁrst symbol on the air interface of the response
frame is of great interest. This includes receiver side PHY layer
processing delay + MAC processing delay + Transmitter side pro-
cessing delay + PCI transfer delay for both Rx and Tx + Front-end
radio hardware delay. If we disregard the MAC processing delay
and the PCI transfer delay then we can summarize the following:
1. Receiver side:
Difference between the last symbol received at the air inter-
face to last bit transferred to host = 14.83μsec.
2. Transmitter side:
Difference between the FIFO read signal to the ﬁrst analog
sample out from the DAC = 11.68 μsec.
3. Key note: The FFT/IFFT module consumes the bulk of the
latency = 7.4 μsec. x 2 (for Tx and Rx) = 14.8μsec.
It is observed that most clock cycles are consumed by the FFT/IFFT
unit and other than that the latency is attributed largely to various
buffering elements required for proper functioning of the pipeline.
in order to further reduce latency we need to use better pipelined
cores with faster cycle times. This is purely a limitation of our pro-
totyping hardware, and not of the method – any commercial WiFi
chipset is already capable of the processing needed to implement
our technique.
The receiver side of the broadcast node comprises of an FFT
engine coupled with the energy detection blocks as shown in Figure
6. This design can form a part of the standard receiver chain [9]
and the mode of operation (depending on if the node is operating
as a client of AP) can be easily selected using software controlled
registers.
As explained in §5.2, triggering the FFT is a key design chal-
lenge. Given our hardware design and its inherent latencies, we
Figure 7: Floor-map of experimental setup
ﬁnd that the total time required for an ACK to reach the AP is
(Trxlatency + Ttxlatency) = 26.51μs. Since ACK transmission
control logic is done in hardware, no MAC processing delay or
PCI/USB data transfer delays are introduced. In order to accom-
modate any propagation delays and other eventualities we further
add a cushion of 2.49μs to the above latency. Thus we trigger
the FFT exactly 29μs after the last sample of the broadcast packet
transmitted to air interface. This time difference ensures that all the
ACK tones from client nodes are available with sufﬁcient energy at
the AP to be able to use a simple threshold test to detect them.
The transceiver is operated in the 2.4GHz ISM band with a
20M Hz bandwidth in order to co-exist with other 802.11a/g
transmissions. The 20M Hz spectrum is split into 64 subcarriers
including the 0th subcarrier (d.c.). The 0th subcarrier is never used
as it will introduce unwanted DC offset at the receiver which has
to be removed using suitable algorithms. The output of the energy
detector is typically a bit mask of 63 (except the dc subcarrier) sub-
carriers. This 63 bit mask is read by the MAC layer routine using
two software addressable registers. The bit mask for −ve subcarri-
ers are numbered MSB = -32 to LSB = -1 while the +ve subcarriers
are numbered MSB = 1 to LSB = 33 (which happens to be always
zero as we are using 32 subcarriers). For example, if subcarriers [-
26, -16, -6, +6, +11, +16] are being used to transmit ACKs then the
bit mask for the −ve frequencies is given by 0x2008020 and that of
the +ve frequency is 0x4210000. The presence of a ’1’ in the bit
mask indicates that subcarrier index is used to transmit the ACK.
Thus a reliable and fairly simple detection of acknowledgment has
been accomplished using a software deﬁned radio.
7. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In this section, we describe our experimental setup and method-
ology to understand how feasible subcarrier detection mechanism
is in reality.
For compatibility with existing 802.11 compliant networks, our
clients would have to transmit an acknowledgment within the SIFS
period of the broadcast packet to avoid collision with any other
transmissions. However, hidden terminals are not immune to this
scenario and may cause collision at the client nodes. However, if
the receiver receives the packet and transmits the tone, the chances
of collision are very low at the AP. Either a client will transmit a
tone due to reception of the broadcast packet, or fail to transmit
tones due to the loss of the broadcast packet. Other nodes not par-
ticipating in the broadcast that are outside the transmission range
of the AP will back-off after they sense the broadcast signal trans-
mitted by the AP due to normal carrier sense mechanisms. Thus,
coexistence with existing 802.11 networks will not be a problem if
stations transmit tones within the SIFS period. The 2.4GHz band
is also shared by 802.15 Zigbee nodes as well, but they use similar
CSMA/CA sensing mechanism before transmission, which will en-
sure successful coexistence with our network. Any protocol using
a carrier sense media access will similarly be compatible.
20Our prototype system, as described in §6, cannot transmit the
tone within the SIFS period. Hence, setting up experiments in the
presence of other 802.11 networks would induce erroneous results
in our protocol evaluation. So, we have used 2.484GHz as the
carrier frequency for our experiments. Closest to the IEEE 802.11
channel 11 (2.462GHz), this band of 20M Hz is free from any
transmissions generated by WiFi cards, but has very similar propa-
gation properties to those used by the 802.11 network. This chan-
nel is also affected by microwave ovens, and other spurious trans-
missions generated by different electrical devices (all of which oc-
curred during our prototype evaluation).
Figure 7 shows a ﬂoor-plan of our indoor setup, with 6 tone
transmitters and 1 receiver/detector. The distances between the
transmitters and the receiver in our testbed can be extended, and
experiments with longer distances and more number of nodes re-
main as future work.
8. RESULTS
To maximally utilize 7 available radios, we decided to show the
performance of our protocol in two steps. The ﬁrst set of experi-
ments demonstrate the efﬁciency of the subcarrier detection mech-
anism, as described in §8.1. The second set of experiments demon-
strate actual transmission of a broadcast packet, followed by tone
transmission from two nodes on successful reception of broadcast
packet, as detailed in §8.2. We used 3 Nallatech Virtex IV PCI
boards as 3 client nodes or the tone transmitters. The rest of the
4 boards were Nallatech Virtex II boards equipped with a USB in-
terface. Each of the 6 clients were set in transmit mode, equipped
with one radio and a transmitter antenna, continuously transmit-
ting tones in a pre-assigned subcarrier. The detector node is setup
in receive mode and repeatedly triggers the detection mechanism
to realize the performance of the energy detection scheme. Three
of the client nodes were in line-of-sight (LOS) of the detector an-
tenna, and the rest were purposefully positioned in non-line-of-
sight nLOS to introduce sufﬁcient signal distortion. The maximum
distance between the transmitter and the receiver antenna was ap-
proximately 5m. Antennas were placed at a height of approxi-
mately 2m from ground level. All the results shown in Figure 9, 10,
11 and 12 are averaged over ﬁve individual experiments at different
times of the day, each experiment was performed 10,000 times to
detect the tones. This is done to show the robustness of the detec-
tion mechanism in presence of ambient noise.
It is to be noted that since we are performing signal processing
at baseband using digitized samples, units of various parameters
are not important because they are represented using ﬁxed-point
precision once converted from the analog domain. For baseband
processing, absolute values as quantized by the ADC are important
and not the true measured values in units of current or voltage. The
actual values in units of current or voltage will depend on the num-
ber representation in the design and the dynamic range of the ADCs
and other electrical components prior to the ADC. Therefore, with-
out loss of generality and integrity, the units of all our variables are
to be interpreted as absolute values.
8.1 Efﬁciency of Tone Detection
In this section, we determine the performance of our protocol,
which is based on tone detection in different subcarriers. Initially,
we aim to show the variation of signal in both time and frequency
domain and how the variation affects the selection of threshold.
Then, we have chosen three different setups to analyze the effect
of spectral leakage around the desired subcarriers. In experiment
1, evenly spaced subcarriers have been assigned to minimize any
spectral leakage. In experiment 2, every alternate subcarrier has
been chosen to detect the effect of spectral leakage in the interme-
diate unassigned subcarriers. Experiment 3 has been designed to
assign contiguous subcarriers for transmission, such that spectral
leak may affect detection at the two extremities of the set of sub-
carriers.
8.1.1 Threshold Selection
To demonstrate the variability of the spectrum over time and
its effect on detection percentage, we collected spectrum data in
the same indoor setup as shown in Figure 7. The receiver gath-
ered 204.8μs of signal, which indicates data for 64 successive FFT
computations, each of duration 3.2μs. In this way, we collected
the composite signal at three different times of the day, resulting
in (64 × 3) = 192 FFT computations. Figure 8 shows the vari-
ation of spectrum energy in both frequency and time. There are
three regions of signal in time ([1-64], [65-128] and [129-192]), all
plotted sequentially. Since coherence time of the channel is more
than 64 FFT computations, we do not notice any major change
in signal power within a single region. However, individual sub-
carriers undergo fading at different times of the day, as we move
from the region of [1-64] FFT computations to the region of [65-
128] computations. Figure 8 also shows that there is a considerable
amount of variation from −47.93dBm to −57.26dBm, in signal
power among different subcarriers at the same FFT computation
time. However, these variations are not enough to create a problem
in selecting a single threshold, −65dBm as shown in the ﬁgure.
Although individual subcarriers undergo attenuation over time the
average signal energy envelope remains almost constant. This helps
us in maintaining a steady threshold for tone detection.
8.1.2 Experiment #1 - Evenly Spaced Subcarriers
In order to benchmark our system performance we used an Ag-
ilent 89600S Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) to compute the spec-
tral components while we present our computation using the FPGA
based FFT engine. For this experiment we have chosen subcarriers
[−26, −16, −6, +6, +11, +16] which are widely spaced not to
interfere with each other. Figure 9(a) and 9(b) shows the similarity
in the FFT computations by the VSA and our hardware. How-
ever it is to be noted that although the measurements are spaced
in time and have different subcarrier amplitudes, they provide the
same spectral components which have been seen to be consistent
over prolonged duration of time. Figure 9(c) shows high detection
percentage at lower thresholds, while the percentage of detection
of heavily attenuated subcarrier +11 reduces only 2% at the maxi-
mum threshold. We notice that the threshold can be easily chosen
from a broad range of 6 to 10.
8.1.3 Experiment #2 - Closely Spaced Subcarriers
Subcarriers [+6, +8, +10, +12, +14, +16] have been used to
demonstrate the effect of spectral leakage of detection percentage.
Again, Figure 10(a) and 10(b) shows identical spectral components.
A drop in detection percentage for subcarrier +14 at threshold 8
can be attributed to instantaneous deep fading during the measure-
ment phase. Figure 10(d) shows that even at low thresholds the
number of false positives are low. This really shows that energy in
other subcarriers which forms the noise ﬂoor for the threshold test
is very low.
8.1.4 Experiment #3 - Contiguous Subcarriers
Transmitting tones on contiguous subcarriers, for example, [+8,
+9, +10, +11, +12, +13], is representative of a pathological case.
With results in shown in Figure 11(c) and 11(d) we argue that even
with contiguous subcarriers there is very limited inter-subcarrier in-
21Figure 8: Variation of spectrum over time
terference. The detection percentage and false positives show sim-
ilar trends to that of experiment #1, which shows that even under
the most critical case the spectral components are easily detected
by performing simple Fourier transform.
The detection percentage together with the false positives and
false negatives in all three experiments show that with our experi-
mental setup and resources, it is not hard to determine an optimal
threshold, which is 8 in this case. Threshold test is applied at the
output of the FFT engine, using the absolute value of the FFT re-
sult on a linear scale. The threshold values show in the Figure 9,
10, 11 are scaled and adjusted numbers to suit the output signals
levels of our ﬁxed point FFT engine. The important thing to note
is how the detection mechanism performs with changing threshold,
rather than the actual number in the threshold axis.
8.2 Complete System Performance
To demonstrate the correctness of the detection mechanism and
the timing requirements mentioned in §5.2 and §6 we setup a test-
bench using three nodes equipped with our SDRs. One of the nodes
is setup as the broadcaster, transmitting broadcast packets at regu-
lar intervals using BPSK 1/2 rate modulation, and performing an
FFT to detect subcarrier energy after 29μs as described in §5.2.
The other two responder nodes placed at 5m line-of-sight from the
broadcaster, and are setup to transmit tones at subcarriers +12 and
−12 respectively. The nodes only transmit the tone if they receive
a broadcast packet correctly.
Figure 12 shows the overall performance of the complete setup.
We notice that with only two subcarriers, the noise ﬂoor is very low
and percentage of detection is high. The subcarrier −12 has been
transmitted at a higher transmit power than subcarrier +12. We
notice the effect in our results as well. False Detection is calculated
per subcarrier, any false detection in positive frequencies has been
considered to be the outliers caused by subcarrier +12, and vice-
versa. Threshold 3 appears to be a low threshold for subcarrier
−12, with percentage false positive of 2.5%. We notice detection
of both the subcarriers −11 and −13 frequently. Since subcarrier
+12 has a lower energy, we see that at threshold 12, percentage
of detection deteriorates.
In this scenario, threshold can be kept
anywhere between 5 to 10 for optimum results.
Experimental results in this section not only prove that we can
use simple Fourier transform to detect multiple tone transmissions
no matter how dense the subcarrier spacing is, but also show that
implementing such mechanism using reconﬁgurable radio to meet
the timing constraints is indeed feasible.
9. DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we discuss the robustness of our scheme to low
client SNR and SNR variations across clients. In our experiments,
the minimum client SNR is measured to be 15.65dB and the max-
imum as 27.07dB. In networks larger than our testbed, the client
SNRs may be lower and span a wider range. Our conjecture is
that such scenarios can be addressed as follows: although the max-
imum and the minimum SNR values will reduce, the power control
mechanism, as described in §4.1, should be able to keep the varia-
tion within the limits of our current measured SNR range. Despite
the fact that the minimum SNR from the weakest client will be less
than the minimum shown in our experiments, we argue that if a
modulated packet can be decoded from that client, which requires
both amplitude and phase detection, our detection mechanism will
be able to detect the existence of energy in that subcarrier. How-
ever, in low SNR regime, unlike single user OFDM transmission,
our multi-user protocol will have different inter-subcarrier interfer-
ence properties. The effect of such interference in our protocol
needs to be evaluated by further experiments.
