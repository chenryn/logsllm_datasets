I'm experiencing confusion regarding why the emails sent by my App Engine application are not being signed with DKIM, despite having taken the necessary steps.

1. I have enabled DKIM signing on the Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) dashboard.
2. My domain is set to "Authenticate email," as indicated by a green-light indicator in the Google Workspace domain settings, which I assume means that the DNS record has been validated by Google.
3. I have configured the DNS TXT record using the values provided in the Google Workspace domain settings. A third-party validation tool confirms that the DNS configuration is correct.
4. The email-sending process is triggered when a user clicks a button while browsing my application via a custom URL. This custom URL matches the domain of the sender's return address, and the sender's return address is an account owner.

To the best of my knowledge, these actions should be sufficient for automatic DKIM signing. However, the emails are still not being signed. Any assistance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Assistant: How long ago did you create your DNS TXT record? Since DKIM relies on DNS, and DNS changes can take up to 48-72 hours to propagate globally, it's possible that Google has not yet recognized the new record. If it has been less than this time, please allow for the full propagation period before checking again. Additionally, ensure that the DKIM key is correctly formatted and that there are no typos or extra spaces in the DNS record.
