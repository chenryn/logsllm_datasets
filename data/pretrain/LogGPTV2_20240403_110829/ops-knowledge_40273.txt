User: Please list common network attack methods and explain the corresponding defense measures
Assistant: 1. Sniffing attack: Attackers use network sniffing tools to intercept data packets transmitted over the network and obtain sensitive information on the network. Defensive measures: encrypted communication protocols and data encryption, VPN technology, use of strong passwords, use of network firewalls. 2. DDoS attack: The attacker sends a large number of invalid requests or traffic to the target server or network device, which degrades the service quality of the target or even paralyzes it. Defensive measures: Use network firewalls, web application firewalls, intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems, traffic analysis and filtering, reverse proxy servers. 3. Phishing attack: Attackers lure users to disclose their personal identity information, financial information, etc. by forging legitimate and credible emails, websites, login pages or other methods. Defensive measures: establish user education and training, use anti-phishing technologies, such as spam filters for mailboxes, security identification technologies for fake websites, and firewalls. 4. Virus attack: destroying, tampering or stealing data by spreading virus programs to user computers or network devices. Defensive measures: Install up-to-date antivirus software, use anti-malware software, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and securely update the operating system. 5. Trojan horse attack: The attacker uses programs hidden in legitimate software or applications to gain control of the target device, steal sensitive information, and change the configuration of the device. Defensive measures: install timely updated anti-virus software and anti-malware software, use security protection software, do not install software from unknown sources, and do not open unknown files. 6. Data leakage attack: Steal sensitive information and disclose it to hackers through various means, such as attacking consoles or online databases with weak passwords. Defense measures: use encryption technology, access control and monitoring system, password control, access control, log monitoring to improve system security. 7. ARP spoofing attack: The attacker uses the loopholes in the ARP protocol to disguise his own MAC address and deceive the target computer or router to send information. Defensive measures: Use ARP spoofing detection tools, minimize use of public WiFi, turn off multicast forwarding, and install app updates. 8. XSS attack: Attackers inject malicious codes into web pages to obtain sensitive data such as users' personal information and login credentials. Defensive measures: Use web application firewalls, filter user input and output data, use secure programming techniques and components. 9. SQL injection attack: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in applications to inject malicious SQL codes to steal or destroy data in the database. Defensive measures: use a web application firewall, restrict the input of SQL data terminal parameters, change the default user and password, and use certified coding techniques.
