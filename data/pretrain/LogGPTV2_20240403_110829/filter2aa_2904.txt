## Corporate Formation
### Making Your Hackerspace a Legal Entity
#### Why Incorporate?
- **Avoiding incorporation** may seem appealing due to:
  - Minimal paperwork
  - Avoiding perceived bureaucratic constraints
- **Benefits of incorporating**:
  - Protection from personal liability
  - Clear distinction between personal and organizational responsibilities

### Types of Legal Entities
#### Nonprofit Corporation
- **Purpose**: Not for profit
- **Stock and Dividends**: Does not issue stock; cannot pay dividends
- **Reinvestment**: All funds must be reinvested into the nonprofit's mission
- **Governance**: Subject to state laws on director, officer, and member meetings
- **Tax Benefits**: Donations may be tax-deductible

#### Traditional Corporation
- **Purpose**: For-profit
- **Stock and Dividends**: Issues shares of stock; can pay dividends
- **Governance**: Subject to state laws on director, officer, and shareholder meetings
- **Taxation**: Both the entity and shareholders' profits are taxed

#### Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- **Purpose**: For-profit
- **Structure**: Hybrid of corporation and partnership
- **Liability**: Limits personal liability of partners
- **Taxation**: Partners' shares of the company's assets are taxed; no taxation at the entity level
- **Complexity**: Can become complex with multiple investors
- **Considerations**: Consult a local tax lawyer if choosing between a corporation and an LLC

### Steps to Incorporate
- **Articles of Incorporation**: Each state has its own form, usually available on the Secretary of State's website. For nonprofits, include an addendum from IRS Publication 557.
- **IRS Employer Identification Number (EIN)**: Obtain an EIN from the IRS website.
- **Bylaws**: Essential for operation, though not typically filed with the state.

### Officers and Directors
- **Requirement**: Both nonprofit and for-profit corporations must have officers and directors.
- **State Regulations**: States specify the number and qualifications of officers and directors.
- **Selection**: Officers should be involved in day-to-day operations; some directors should also be actively involved.
- **Authority**: Clearly define the authority of directors in the bylaws.

## Nonprofit Considerations
### Maximizing Your Nonprofit Hackerspace
#### Reinvestment
- **Core Principle**: Nonprofits must reinvest all received funds into the organization to advance its mission.
- **Funding**: Can collect membership fees and donations but cannot distribute them as profit.

#### Nonprofit Purposes
- **State and Federal Requirements**: Must have a recognized nonprofit purpose to qualify for legal benefits.
- **Tax-Exempt Status (ยง501(c)(3))**:
  - **Definition**: Section of the tax code defining requirements for tax-deductible donations.
  - **Requirements**: Organized for a recognized nonprofit purpose; no political campaign activity.
  - **Application**: Expensive ($750) but beneficial to file within 15 months of incorporating.
  - **Deductions**: Dues are not deductible; donations are.

### State Law Considerations
- **Charitable Registrations**
- **Sales Tax Exemptions**
- **Charitable Immunity**
- **Liability Shield Provisions**: Decisions on paying directors.

## Securing a Physical Space
### Key Considerations
- **Zoning**: Understand city ordinances governing land use and ensure compliance with planned activities.
- **Leasing**:
  - **Transparency**: Be upfront with the landlord.
  - **Review Lease**: Read the lease carefully and have a lawyer review it.
  - **Negotiate Terms**: Protect your hackerspace through favorable lease terms.
  - **Naming**: Ensure the lease is in the hackerspace's name.

## Liability and Risk Management
### Insurance
- **Coverage**: Personal injury and property damage.
- **Necessity**: Often required by lease agreements and essential even if not specified.
- **Honesty**: Be candid with the insurer about the nature of the space and activities.

### Waivers
- **Participants**: Members and non-members.
- **Content**: Acknowledge the space's dangers, take personal responsibility for safety, hold the hackerspace harmless, and confirm competence to sign.
- **Language**: Use plain English.
- **Supplemental**: Waivers do not replace a culture of safety.

## Conclusion
- **Enjoyment**: Despite the legal complexities, hackerspaces are a lot of fun.
- **Leadership**: As a leader, addressing legal foundations will help you focus on the creative and enjoyable aspects of running the space.
