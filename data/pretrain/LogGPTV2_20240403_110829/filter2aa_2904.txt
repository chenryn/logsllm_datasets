disclaimer...or, what this talk isn't
● This talk is for informational purposes, and is 
not personal legal advice.  It does not create an 
attorney-client relationship between me and 
any of you who are listening to it.  
● Even though I have made every effort to make 
the content as accurate as possible, there is no 
way I can address all the legal issues that may 
ever come up.  
● Also, the way to best address each issue often 
varies by state or jurisdiction.  I am only 
licensed in Illinois.
what this talk is
● introduce you to the 
most common issues 
that arise when 
starting hackerspaces
● introduce you to 
common ways states 
treat them
● equip you to ask the 
right questions as you 
start and plan your 
hackerspace.
corporate formation
making your hackerspace 
a real, live legal entity
why incorporate?
● not incorporating may 
be tempting
– paperwork
– giving in to “the man”
● however, 
incorporating 
protects you!
– personal vs. 
organizational liability
corporate and corporate-like forms
● nonprofit corporation
– not for profit
– does not issue stock, and cannot pay dividends
– all money must be reinvested into nonprofit purpose
– subject to state laws governing director, officer, and 
member meetings
– donations may be eligible for tax deductions
corporate and corporate-like forms
● traditional corporation
– for-profit entity
– issues shares of stock, and may pay dividends on 
those shares
– subject to state laws governing director, officer, and 
shareholder meetings
– entity is taxed, as well as shareholders' profits
corporate and corporate-like forms
● limited liability company
– for-profit entity
– hybrid between corporation and partnership
– limits the personal liability of partners
– entity itself is not taxed, but partners' shares of the 
company's assets are taxed
– gets complicated with more than a few investors
● can't issue stock certificates as evidence of owners
● consult a local tax lawyer if you decide to go 
for-profit and need to decide between a 
corporation and an LLC.
making your hackerspace a legal 
entity
● articles of incorporation
– each state has its own form, which is normally on 
the Secretary of State's website
– addendum from IRS Publication 557, for nonprofits
● IRS Employee ID Number
– http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=10
2767,00.html
● bylaws
– generally not filed with the state, but necessary to 
operate
officers and directors
● corporations, both nonprofit and for-profit, must 
have officers and directors
– state corporations codes prescribe how many are 
necessary, and minimum qualifications
● who should your officers and directors be?
– officers really need to be involved day-to-day
– at least some directors should be involved day-to-
day
● how much authority should  directors have?
– decide this early, and put it in your bylaws!
nonprofit issues
getting the most out of your
nonprofit hackerspace
reinvestment:  the core of a 
nonprofit
● nonprofit organization 
must put the money it 
receives back into the 
organization to 
advance its purpose
● can collect 
membership fees and 
donations; cannot 
distribute them to 
investors as profit.
nonprofit purposes
● both state and federal governments require a 
nonprofit purpose in order to get the legal 
advantages of a nonprofit
tax-exempt status under §501(c)(3)
● §501(c)(3) is the section of the tax code that 
defines the requirements for organizations to 
which donations are federally tax-deductible
● must be organized for a recognized nonprofit 
purpose, and not engage in political campaign 
activity
● expensive ($750), but beneficial to file within 15 
months of incorporating
● dues are not deductible; donations are
state-law considerations
● charitable 
registrations
● sales tax exemptions
● charitable immunity
● liability shield 
provisions:  to pay the 
directors, or not to 
pay the directors?
getting a physical space
finding a nice space is exciting,
but take time to protect yourself.
zoning
● city ordinance 
governing how each 
parcel of land may be 
used
● know what activities 
your hackerspace is 
planning to do
● nonconforming use 
fines
leasing
● be up-front with the 
landlord
● read the lease, and 
get a lawyer to read it 
as well
● negotiate lease terms 
to protect your 
hackerspace
● get the lease in your 
hackerspace's name
liability
hackerspaces are dangerous.
plan for the worst.
insurance
● insure against
– personal injury
– property damage
● often a requirement of 
a lease contract—and 
necessary even if it is 
not a term of the 
lease
● be candid with the 
insurer
waivers
● members and non-members
● make sure the waiver covers:
– acknowledging that the space is dangerous
– personal responsibility for safety
– holding the hackerspace harmless if anything 
happens
– competence to sign the waiver
● use plain English
● not a replacement for a culture of safety
in conclusion...
● despite the fact that i am a professional killjoy, i 
know as well as you do that hackerspaces are 
a lot of fun!
● as a leader of the space, it'll be a lot easier for 
you to set aside your stress and have fun 
building things if you make sure to cover the 
legal bases as you go through the process of 
starting your space.
in the words of my Constitutional 
Law professor...
