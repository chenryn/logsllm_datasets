them using a professional pretext, as dictated by scope. Their home
address is valuable if I want to phish them from HR, citing a mis-
take in their details. Sometimes you may need to know little else
about a person other than the country they live in. For instance, if I
know a target lives in the UK, an SMSish from Royal Mail is a solid
bet for a click. In the United States, the US Postal Service is a likely
candidate to get a click. For a phish, I mainly just need their email
address to be factual. I can use almost any other information I come
across to build into a phish, taking personal and professional infor-
mation and tying it back to the objective.
Simply knowing where someone works is a great start to mak-
ing a tieback— you can check online forums to search for records
about the hardware or software the company uses and call when IT
is citing issues with it.
For physical jobs, you will need to know the location, and you
might want to know the shifts of guards to make getting in and out
that much easier—t hat tieback of that information to the objective is
easy. You might also want to look at the entries, exits, underground
access points, aerial views, and surveillance spots— you should be
able to tie all that back to the objective and work out how to use all
that information. The rest will be specific to the location, includ-
ing terrain, surroundings, staff numbers, likelihood of visitors, and
likelihood of unfamiliar people going unnoticed or unchallenged.
Most information you come across that exists in part outside of the
organization, such as vendor or contractor information, is typically
easier to weaponize and leverage.
I once broke into a large warehouse with the help of a very gifted
pentester and social engineer who has asked never to be named.
Our job was to get inside and access any computer terminal, tak-
ing photos as evidence. For this, we needed to know employee shift
times and attempted to gain information on the types of locks they
used and the type of computers through recon.
No matter the type of job, the same principle applies: you need
to gather information, weaponize it, and leverage it.
The weaponization of information in the moment is also a vital
skill that cannot be overvalued with regard to an ethical attacker’s
The Laws 77
performance. There’s a certain amount of opportunistic ability and
situational agility that an EA must be able to apply when executing
an attack. It is what I refer to as an attacker’s opportunistic­apti-
tude. It’s the ability of the EA to see and act on opportunity in the
moment, never letting their target(s) know it’s haphazard. A level
of opportunistic aptitude can be taught, but building it up into a
deft skill will fall to the EA themselves. This ability to pivot while
maintaining character and to focus on the objective falls under the
umbrella of mental agility, specifically, “persuasive performance.”
Agile, persuasive performance provided by an EA is the effective
exploitation of human weakness through covert adversarial behav-
ior. Bit of a mouthful, but broken down, it means that the attacker
mindset, when executed properly, is versatile and adaptable and
doesn’t falter from the objective.
The critical finding here is that a plethora of information may
exist for any one client you get. Your job is to be able to parse that
information by applying it to the objective, both prior to the attack
and when executing it. To parse information effectively and effi-
ciently, I tend to think of it as a puzzle of sorts: if I can’t get the
information to fit to the central piece (the objective), I disregard it
and move on.
In summation, the weaponization of information that is com-
monplace to everyone else is the true mark of a security expert with
a strong, effective AMs—i n both the act of attacking and the plan-
ning of it. The information you gather will go into three buckets:
(a) useful for recon and building familiarity, (b) useful for pretext,
and (c) not useful at all. But I am now getting ahead of myself. We
will cover more about information processing in a later chapter,
in Chapter 6, “Information Processing: Observation and Thinking
Techniques.”
Law 3: Never Break Pretext
Now we move to pretexts. A persuasive performance is crucial in
defeating an unwitting target. To be effective under your pretext,
78 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
two things must be true. The first is that you must be able to play
the part of your pretext accordingly—for instance, it would likely
be detrimental to most operations for me to show up as a repair
technician. I don’t know enough about repairs of any kind to pull
that off, nor do I easily fit the part of a repair technician. I could go
as an inspector from a repair company, though— there to take notes
and inspect some items.
With a pretext, you must be able to see clearly what other people
think of you and lean into it when beneficial. This self-a wareness
will allow you to know your shortcomings, and it will allow you to
play the parts that suit you. Attacker behavior is not politically cor-
rect, and neither are the biases you must play into.
The second thing is that pretexts must be built off of infor-
mation. You cannot pull a pretext out of thin air and hope for the
best. Just knowing that most companies have vendors doesn’t give
you the vendor pretext card. It certainly doesn’t permit it without
detailed searches of your target company’s specific vendors.
Sure, there are times you will have to go in blind because the
information doesn’t exist. These are rare and extreme cases. How-
ever, inferences can still be made, and you will likely need to employ
hardier recon tactics— likely military-l evel recon. Military- level
recon takes into consideration the effects of forces like weather
on the target terrain, and determines at what point the enemy can
observe them. It also takes into account the target’s known recon
capabilities, typically things like infrared, thermal, light enhance-
ment, and enlarging capabilities.
Military- level recon also takes into consideration route inves-
tigation: an attempt to obtain detailed information of a specified
route and all terrain from which the target could influence move-
ment along the route. Most often this is beyond the range of a job,
with only the very immediate surroundings of the target envi-
ronment being investigated. Some jobs, perhaps for government
engagements, will require this level of recon.
Military “reconnaissance-i n- force” is a deliberate combat oper-
ation designed to discover or test the enemy’s strength, dispositions,
and reactions or to obtain other information.
The Laws 79
Whether your job dictates that you direct effort to military-l evel
recon or red-t eam/social- engineer–level recon, the common thread
still remains: information is key. A scrap is not ideal, but it will do.
And if you use laws 1 and 2 against that scrap of information, you
will end up with more than you started out with.
A pretext is one of the most powerful and unique laws of the
four. It exists to serve the others, but the others cannot function
without it. Delving back into the world of spies, a good spy could
know their desired goal, gather and weaponize information, and
attempt to apply that information for the good of the objective. They
would immediately be in Guantanamo if they wandered into their
target’s environment and laid the truth out. Pretexting is important.
Take Adolf Tolkachev. He was a chief engineer at the Soviet
Radar Design Bureau, which focused on the development and pro-
totyping of advanced aero-n avigational systems. Tolkachev had the
highest- level access to Soviet state secrets. He approached a CIA
agent in 1977 at a gas station in Moscow and slipped him a note
stating that he wanted to become an American spy. The CIA was
naturally suspicious of a KGB trap, so they said no to Tolkachev— on
multiple occasions. Finally, his attempts met with success and the
CIA gave him the codename “Sphere.”
Tolkachev was stable and believable in his role— he fit it per-
fectly. He remained an engineer, and so the KGB never suspected
him of being a spy. Tolkachev used his own devices and procedures
to get information to the CIA since he realized many of the pro-
cedures provided were simply ineffectual. For example, he modi-
fied a civilian camera and used it instead of the camera provided
to him for his endeavors. He knew it would not fit his pretext and
would actually be a point of potential failure. Through his pretexts,
Tolkachev revealed top secret research documents on weapons to
be created years into the future, including details such as air-t o- air
missiles, surface-t o- air missiles, and fighter aircraft information.
As a source for the CIA, he reported detailed data on new Soviet
weapon systems that would not have been available for years, if
ever. Tolkachev provided complete documentation before the sys-
tems were even fully operational.
80 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Tolkachev never broke character and would have likely never
been caught. He used all the laws together and had skills beyond
reckoning. He never gave anyone pause for thought. Despite being
very careful, he was captured by KGB in 1985 after CIA officer
Edward Lee Howard, who defected from the United States to the
Soviet Union, outed him.
As ethical attackers, we cannot quite operate like spies. There
must be demarcations set that you cannot use your sexuality, looks,
or compelling or coercive promises and lies to gain entry—a ctual
network pentesting being the exception to the rule. In all other cases,
a pretext whereby you talk with another human must be ethically
aboveboard; otherwise, you become unable to teach someone what
they should’ve done in a situation where they failed. As an exam-
ple, I would likely let someone into a building if they threatened to
kill my family. There is no teachable moment there, and we must
operate well above that to prove vulnerabilities in an organization’s
security. It’s also ethically wrong and absurd to flirt your way into a
building. By nonparticipation in these sorts of actions, you are not
ignoring they might work and leaving the client open to that risk.
Your job is to get past security defenses and then implement or sug-
gest processes that keep all others out that may try— however they
may try. Your pretext doesn’t have to be nasty. You prove a better,
stronger, more valid point by using more vanilla pretexts, showing
that if something as weak as a “new employee” without their card
can get through their defenses, anyone can.
Law 4: Every Move Made Benefits the Objective
This is a very straightforward law. You do not deviate from your
given course. You cannot switch directions, physically or figura-
tively for your own personal gain, for your own personal curiosity,
or for any other reason. Like a spy, you can apply the first two laws
to your mission, but if 3 and 4 are not also applied to the mission,
you face an internal conflict and mission failure.
The Laws 81
Everything you do has to be for the good of the mission. It might
be for the short-t erm good, like switching pretexts or exiting a build-
ing or even a network before it is optimal. This could be so that
you appear to be operating like your supposed peers—l eaving at the
end of the day if you cannot hide in plain sight or actually hide.
You might need to switch pretexts depending on where you are in
the mission; a network pentester has to disguise their traffic when
exfiltrating data, which is likely done differently compared to how
they first gained access to the network. In the same way, a physi-
cal pentester has to hide their real self the deeper they get into an
environment and the longer they are there. They might gain access
as a cleaner at night but transform into a nightshift worker when
entering the server room. Like Tolkachev, you might modify or even
forgo equipment altogether if it will prove to be a distraction from
your pretext and so to the good of the objective.
No matter if the gain is for long or short term, you must not do
anything just for the sake of doing it. You must at least believe that
each step you take will move you in the right direction—t he direc-
tion of achieving the objective.
Summary
• Working from the end of an attack backward as a way of plan-
ning, designing, and executing an attack is paramount to suc-
cess and one of the best cognitive skills an attacker can have.
• If you are already inclined to act and think this way, it might
appear as though there’s no other way to perform an attack.
However, it is not uncommon for people to only think linearly,
asking how to get into something rather than first thinking
about where they are going when they enter.
• There are two fundamentals to look at when forming an attack:
your objective and what your cover story will be. Let all your
efforts be directed to that objective, and let your mind keep that
end in view at all times.
82 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
There are four rules of the mindset. They must all work together
in order to obtain success.
Key Message
An attack should be kept to its simplest form. Starting from the end
of the attack and backing into it is the most efficient, clarifying pro-
cess and strategy you can use.
Chapter 5
Curiosity, Persistence,
and Agility
Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for
granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.
—Francis Bacon
W
hat’s the one thing persistence needs to exist?
It’s a goal.
Persistence needs a pursuit. It could be argued that it
also needs curiosity as its momentum, although I can concede there
are exceptions to that rule— not all persistence is fueled by curiosity.
Some forms of persistence rely on dogged beliefs and unwavering
prejudice or narrow-m indedness. For instance, malicious attackers
do not use curiosity as a tool. Instead, they team their persistence
up with malevolent intent and pedal their beliefs that way. These
two things— curiosity and persistence— don’t always go hand in
hand, but the combination is vital for the mindset we are seeking.
83
84 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Curiosity itself is a driving force of progress within an attack
scenario, but it will not pay off without persistence. There’s also
another point that can’t go unmentioned here: you will have noth-
ing to persist in if you cannot take in information and leverage even
the most ordinary information properly. If you jump on the wrong
pieces of information and try to use them persistently to your
advantage, the operation will misfire early on. This is where another
cognitive skill intersects: mental agility. There are two times it is
pertinent. One is when you’ve leveraged good information against
a target or environment but still end up with a less-t han- adequate
result and need to pivot quickly. The other is when you’ve leveraged
the wrong information and need to pivot quickly. I will lay out an
example of each, which should help you conceptualize.
There are times when you will have gathered solid data. You
will know everything about your target in order to get you in the
door and on the way to achieving your objective, but something out
of your control will thwart you, and you will have to pivot. Imagine
lining up the perfect vishing call for a target. You have her name,
number, department and position, job details and responsibilities,
the times she works, and her clearance level. All you have to do is
call her office and convince her to give you portal access. You finally
dial the number, spoofing your number to appear as if internal to
the very organization you’re trying to penetrate. The ringing stops
and someone picks up. But it’s not your target. For one thing, the
voice sounds as if it’s the wrong gender. Then they introduce them-
selves and sure enough, the person you are talking to is not the per-
son you were hoping for. However, they are within scope.
If it were me, imagining a proxy for my target answered, I would
springboard into my new attack on the same call. I would explain
the predicament through the veil of my pretext and push on, wrap-
ping my new target into the same web and aiming for the same out-
come. “Oh, I wonder if you can help— I still need my portal access
reset. When I talked to her a few days ago, she said it takes a while,
but I need in today!”
There’s a chance this approach will work, and the odds will be
far more in my favor if I am agile enough to twist the information
Curiosity, Persistence, and Agility 85
to suit the new set of circumstances I’ve found myself in this hypo-
thetical situation.
Of course, there are also times where you inadvertently leverage
the wrong information. Imagine entering a target’s workplace with
the information they are enjoying time off. Let’s say you were pos-
ing as maintenance, there to fix something in the target’s office that
they’d scheduled you for. Imagine your surprise if it turned out they
were in their office at that very moment, and the receptionist was
calling them to verify you were indeed supposed to be there.
GULP.
Well, you would have to be agile enough to produce an issue of
your own. You might enlist the help of a teammate by calling them
in front of the receptionist and/or target to say you’d ran into an
issue. You’d have to explain it like someone confused about why
you’d been sent out at the wrong time. You might even go as far as
to get “new information” from your office, perhaps stating you had
been scheduled by someone else at the company and had confused
the situation. I’d apologize and I’d likely act quietly mortified.
I’d push this as far as I could and likely have a teammate spoof
a call from a legitimate source within the company that fits the role
of maintenance scheduler. Without an ounce of fear or unease, I’d
ask if they still wanted me to perform the work or if they wanted to
book me at a later time. If they opted for a later time, I would make
sure it was within the timeframe the scope allowed and I’d go back
