User: How to configure and manage a complex network topology including multiple routers, switches, firewalls and servers? Please provide a network topology diagram and configuration file.
Assistant: Since this question is very complex, I can only provide a simple example of network topology and configuration file to provide some reference. The network topology is as follows: Internet | Firewall (F1) + Router (R1) | +--+----------+----------+--+ | | | | | Switch (S1) Router (R2) Switch (S2) | | | | | Web Server Database Server configuration file is as follows: Firewall (F1): ----------------- interface eth0 ip address 10.0.0.1/24 interface eth1 ip address 192.168.0.1/24 access-list inbound permit tcp any any eq www access-list inbound permit tcp any any eq ssh access-list outbound permit ip any any ip route 0.0.0.0 0. 0 .0.0 10.0.0.254 Router (R1): ---------------- interface eth0 ip address 10.0.0.254/24 interface eth1 ip address 172.16.0.1/24 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0 .0.0 10.0.0.1 Router (R2): ---------------- interface eth0 ip address 172.16.0.2/24 interface eth1 ip address 192.168.1.1/24 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0 .0.0 172.16.0.1 Switch (S1): ------------------ interface gigabitethernet0/1 switchport mode access switchport access vlan 10 interface gigabitethernet0/2 switchport mode access switchport access vlan 10 Switch (S2): ------------------ interface gigabitethernet0/1 switchport mode access switchport access vlan 20 interface gigabitethernet0/2 switchport mode access switchport access vlan 20 Web Server: -- --------------- interface eth0 ip address 192.168.1.10/24 default gateway 192.168.1.1 Database Server: ------------------ interface eth0 ip address 172.16.0.10/24 default gateway 172.16.0.1 Please note that this is just a simple example, and the actual network topology and configuration files need to be adjusted according to specific needs and device performance.
