For code that builds a UI has to be readable. I understand that Dart is kind
of like a simple version of Java, but it is not really a programming language
for building a UI. For example, it doesn't have a closing tag. As a result, It
is very hard to build a picture in mind with this unreadable code.
Moreover, Flutter was inspired by React. How can Flutter doesn't have JSX but
has this kind of unreadable code? I am very scared that Flutter is going to
die very soon as the early days of AnglurJs.
I understand people who work in Google are smart, but we also have some people
who are not really smart choose React instead of Dart, and this is one of the
reasons why Dart was dead in the past.
