User: I have a python script which takes a while to finish its executing depending on the passed argument. So if I run them from two terminals with different arguments, do they get their own version of the code? I can't see two .pyc files being generated.
Terminal 1 runs: python prog.py 1000 > out_1000.out
Before the script running on terminal 1 terminate, i start running an another; thus terminal 2 runs:  python prog.py 100 > out_100.out
Or basically my question is could they interfere with each other?
Assistant: Each Python interpreter process is independent. How the script reacts to itself being run multiple times depends on the exact code in use, but in general they should not interfere.
