User: How to Configure the IP Address (IP Configuration) Using the Command Line in the Linux System?
Assistant: You can use the following steps to configure the IP address using the command line in the Linux system: 1. Open the terminal/command line interface (Terminal). 2. Enter the following command to view the information of the current network interface: `ifconfig` 3. Find the network interface that needs to be configured (such as eth0), and use the following command to disable the network interface: `sudo ifconfig eth0 down` 4. Use the following command to configure The IP address and subnet mask to use: `sudo ifconfig eth0 <IP address> netmask <subnet mask>` For example, the command to configure eth0 with an IP address of 192.168.1.100 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is as follows : `sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0` 5. Enable the network interface: `sudo ifconfig eth0 up` 6. Check that the network interface is configured correctly using the following command: `ifconfig` Confirm that the new IP address has been configured successfully. 7. To make these configurations permanent, edit the network settings file and add the following: `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces` This will open the editor and allow you to add IP address information to the interface configuration file . Add the following information at the end of the interface configuration file: ``` iface eth0 inet static address <IP address> netmask <subnet mask> gateway <gateway address> ``` For example: ``` iface eth0 inet static address 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 ``` Note that the gateway address is usually the IP address of the router. When you're done, save your changes and exit the editor. 8. Restart the network service: `sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart` This command will restart the network service and write the configuration to the file, ensuring that the new IP address and subnet mask will still exist on the next boot.
