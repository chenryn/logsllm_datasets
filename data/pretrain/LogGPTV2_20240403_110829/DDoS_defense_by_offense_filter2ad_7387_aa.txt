**Abstract:**
This paper presents the design, implementation, analysis, and experimental evaluation of Speak-Up, a defense mechanism against application-level distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In such attacks, malicious actors overwhelm a server with legitimate-looking requests that consume computational resources (e.g., CPU cycles, disk). Speak-Up encourages all clients, within resource limits, to automatically send higher volumes of traffic. We assume that attackers are already using most of their upload bandwidth and thus cannot react to this encouragement. However, good clients typically have spare upload bandwidth and will respond by significantly increasing their traffic. This increased traffic from good clients crowds out the bad ones, allowing good clients to capture a larger fraction of the server's resources. Our experiments under various conditions show that Speak-Up causes the server to allocate resources in proportion to the aggregate upload bandwidth of the clients, making the defense viable and effective for real-world attacks.

**Introduction:**
Our goal is to defend servers against application-level DDoS attacks, where attackers mimic legitimate client behavior by sending proper-looking requests via compromised hosts. These attacks exploit the fact that many Internet servers have "open clientele," making it difficult to distinguish between good and bad clients. The appeal of these attacks over traditional ICMP floods is that they require less bandwidth and are harder to detect, as the traffic appears legitimate. Examples include bots attacking web sites by requesting large files, making search engine queries, and issuing computationally expensive requests.

Current DDoS defenses focus on slowing down bad clients. While we share the goal of limiting the service that attackers receive, our approach is different. We rely on encouragement, where the server prompts clients to automatically send more traffic, provided they have the resources. By encouraging all clients to increase their traffic, good clients, who typically use only a small fraction of their available bandwidth, will drastically increase their traffic volume. This results in good clients capturing a larger portion of the server's resources, effectively crowding out the bad clients.

In this paper, we provide a detailed description of the design, prototype implementation, and evaluation of Speak-Up, a defense against application-level DDoS attacks. We also place our approach in the context of other DDoS defenses, including over-provisioning, detection and blocking, and charging clients in a currency. Speak-Up is a currency-based approach that uses bandwidth as the currency.

**Applicability of Speak-Up:**

Before delving into the design of Speak-Up, we discuss the conditions under which it is useful and the extent of its effectiveness. We address four commonly asked questions and characterize our threat model and the range of applicability.

**2.1 Four Questions:**

1. **How much aggregate bandwidth do legitimate clients need for Speak-Up to be effective?**
   - Speak-Up helps good clients regardless of their bandwidth. It either ensures that good clients get all the service they need or increases the service they receive compared to an attack without Speak-Up. The ratio of available bandwidth to current usage is expected to be high. Additionally, Speak-Up raises the bar for attackers, requiring a much larger botnet to inflict the same level of service-denial.

2. **How much aggregate bandwidth do legitimate clients need to remain unharmed during an attack?**
   - The answer depends on the server's spare capacity. For a server with 50% spare capacity, good clients can retain full service if they have the same aggregate bandwidth as the attacking clients. For a server with 90% spare capacity, good clients need only 1/9th of the aggregate bandwidth of the attacking clients.

3. **Could small web sites still be harmed even if defended by Speak-Up?**
   - Yes, small web sites may still be vulnerable to large botnets. However, we expect future botnets to be smaller due to better bot detection by ISPs. This will make Speak-Up more broadly applicable.

4. **Does the encouragement to send more traffic damage the network?**
   - Speak-Up inflates traffic only to servers currently under attack, a small fraction of all servers. The core network is heavily over-provisioned and can absorb the additional traffic. Moreover, the additional traffic is congestion-controlled and shares fairly with other traffic.

**2.2 Threat Model and Applicability Conditions:**

- **Threat Model:**
  - Speak-Up aims to protect a server with scarce computational resources from an attacker trying to deplete those resources with legitimate-looking requests.
  - Attackers use many compromised hosts, and the traffic follows all protocols, making it difficult for the server to identify malicious requests.
  - The attacker can intentionally send difficult requests.

- **Applicability Conditions:**
  - **C1: Adequate link bandwidth.** The protected service needs enough link bandwidth to handle the incoming request stream, which will be inflated by Speak-Up.
  - **C2: Adequate client bandwidth.** Good clients must have, in total, roughly the same order of magnitude (or more) bandwidth as the attacking clients.
  - **C3: No pre-defined clientele.** If the server has a pre-defined clientele, it can use filters or capabilities to permit only known clients.
  - **C4: Non-human clientele.** If the clientele is exclusively human, proof-of-humanity tests can be used.

By addressing these conditions and questions, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the applicability and effectiveness of Speak-Up in defending against application-level DDoS attacks.
