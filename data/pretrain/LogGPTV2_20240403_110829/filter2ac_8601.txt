### Title: Another Way to Communicate with the Browser: Exploiting Chrome at the Network Layer

Networking is a critical and complex task for web browsers, encompassing everything from high-level JavaScript APIs to the management of individual socket connections. Remote servers can control every byte sent to the browser during communication, which can lead to memory safety issues when the browser processes these inputs. However, beyond these data processing security concerns, are there other logic flaws that can be exploited? How can such bugs be identified and leveraged?

In this presentation, we will explore how we discovered and exploited several vulnerabilities in the Chrome network stack. These vulnerabilities allowed us to compromise the renderer process and escape the Chrome sandbox. We will delve into the design flaws related to resource fetching and caching, as well as one of the transport layer protocols embedded in Chrome. We will also demonstrate how server-side responses can influence browser behavior, leading to security vulnerabilities. Finally, we will detail the exploitation strategies we used to win the Chrome category in the Tianfu Cup 2021 Cybersecurity Contest.
