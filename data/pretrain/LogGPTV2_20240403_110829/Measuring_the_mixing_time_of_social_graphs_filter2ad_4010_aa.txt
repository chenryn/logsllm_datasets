ABSTRACT
Social networks provide interesting algorithmic properties that can
be used to bootstrap the security of distributed systems. For exam-
ple, it is widely believed that social networks are fast mixing, and
many recently proposed designs of such systems make crucial use
of this property. However, whether real-world social networks are
really fast mixing is not veriﬁed before, and this could potentially
affect the performance of such systems based on the fast mixing
property. To address this problem, we measure the mixing time
of several social graphs, the time that it takes a random walk on
the graph to approach the stationary distribution of that graph, us-
ing two techniques. First, we use the second largest eigenvalue
modulus which bounds the mixing time. Second, we sample ini-
tial distributions and compute the random walk length required to
achieve probability distributions close to the stationary distribution.
Our ﬁndings show that the mixing time of social graphs is much
larger than anticipated, and being used in literature, and this im-
plies that either the current security systems based on fast mixing
have weaker utility guarantees or have to be less efﬁcient, with less
security guarantees, in order to compensate for the slower mixing.

INTRODUCTION
Popularity of social networks have stimulated many ideas for us-
ing these networks to build revolutionary systems in many areas,
including security and communication [24, 31, 3, 30, 12, 32, 11,
23, 25, 22, 29]. The systems built on top of social networks ex-
ploit algorithmic properties of the social graph, as well as the social

trust. For instance, some security designs exploit the “fast mixing”
property, an indicator of how quickly a random walk on a graph ap-
proaches the stationary distribution, to build Sybil [4] defenses [31,
3, 30, 12, 32, 11, 23]. Some other designs use node betweenness,
an indicator of how a node is well-situated on the path between
other nodes in the graph, for building Sybil defense as well [19].
There are also designs which use betweenness and similarity for
building routing algorithms in disconnected networks [2], among
many other designs based on different assumptions.
The applicability and effectiveness of these designs are critically
dependent on the quality or degree of these properties in under-
lying social graphs. But, while they base their constructions and
designs on these properties—assuming a high quality of the prop-
erties in the social graphs, they do not give conclusive evidences
of the quality of these properties. It is claimed that these proper-
ties hold, based on mathematical models and indirect experiments,
but it is hard to ﬁnd a single work that evaluates the qualities of
such properties directly in actual social networks. But doing that, it
will be then possible to determine the exact quality of the property
required for these designs to work.
For example, the mixing time of the social graph, which mea-
sures how quick a random walk on the graph reaches the stationary
distribution, is claimed to be fast. Such claim implies that social
graphs are well-enmeshed and any arbitrary destination in the so-
cial graph is reachable, with a probability driven according to the
stationary distribution—a distribution that is proportional to nodes’
degrees, from each possible source with a relatively small number
of intermediaries. Furthermore, this property has been used widely
without careful measurement of the mixing time [31, 3, 30, 12]. For
example, Yu et al. [31] proposed SybilGuard, a Sybil defense pro-
tocol that exploits the fast mixing property of social graphs. Even
though they performed experiments on social networks, their ex-
periment was not about actual measurement of the mixing time
of these graphs (see Section 2). Danezis and Mittal [3] proposed
SybilInfer to detect Sybil nodes in social graph basing their design
on the fast mixing property of social graph and cited [18] as an ev-
idence to prove that social networks are fast mixing. We notice,
however, that ﬁndings in [18] do not support the mixing time with
the guarantees needed by SybilInfer. Lesniewski-Laas et al. [12]
introduced Wh¯anau, a Sybil-proof routing protocol that uses the
fast mixing property and, while citing the existence of the property
to a large body of previous work, they have attempted to estimate
the mixing time in a few social graphs. However, their evidence is
only circumstantial and it does not directly follow that these social
graphs are really fast mixing (see Section 2).
In this paper, we evaluate the mixing time of social graphs. We
systematically measure the mixing time of social graphs in a vari-
ety of real-world small to large-scale social networks (see Table 1),
383with designs based on these properties in mind. We use two meth-
ods for measuring the mixing time. First, we compute the Second
Largest Eigenvalue Modulus (SLEM) of the social graphs which
bounds the mixing time. Also, we sample initial points and com-
pute the random walk with varying walk lengths. We ﬁnd that in
many actual large-scale social networks, the mixing time is much
larger than suggested by those papers, which apply the fast mix-
ing of social networks to design security systems. By experiment-
ing with one of these systems—SybilLimit [30], we unveil that the
quality of the mixing time required for such design is not as being
claimed, yet in some real-world social graphs higher than antic-
ipated, which calls for further investigation of the theory beyond
these designs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we re-
view some of the related work in literature. In section 3, we review
the preliminaries including the network model, the random walk,
and the mixing time. In section 4, we introduce the main results
followed by discussion in section 5. Finally, in section 6 we draw
concluding remarks and future work.
2. RELATED WORK
There are many systems built on top of social graphs and their
properties. Daly et al. [2] proposed a social network-based scheme
for routing in disconnected delay-tolerant mobile ad-hoc networks
which uses both of the betweenness and similarity properties. Quer-
cia et al. [19] used the betweenness property to defend against the
Sybil attack in mobile networks. Yu et al. [30, 31] used the fast
mixing property of a graph to build a defense mechanism against
the Sybil attack. Danezis and Mittal [3] used the fast mixing prop-
erty to build an inference (detection) mechanism for Sybil nodes
in peer-to-peer Systems. Lesniewski-Laas et al. [12] introduced
a routing protocol that uses the fast mixing property of the social
graph. Kaustz et al. introduced ReferralWeb [7], a referral sys-
tem that combines social networks and collaborative ﬁltering and
assumes a well-connected social network graph, a property that is
very tied to the mixing time of the graph [6].
Schemes like SybilGuard [31] and SybilLimit [30] of Yu et al.,
and Wh¯anau of Lesniewski-Laas et al. [12] are based on the fast
mixing property of social networks, and they did perform experi-
ments on some real social networks. But their experiments did not
directly measure or estimate the mixing time of these social net-
works. Let us summarize contents of their experiments as follows.
Yu et al. [30] performed some experiments based on real-world
social graphs. They ran their scheme with ﬁxed, small walk length
(e.g., 10 or 15), and checked whether their scheme works as well
as expected (thereby indirectly trying to conﬁrm that the graph is
fast mixing). But, there are some deﬁciencies in their methodology.
First, they manipulated the social graphs by trimming lower degree
nodes in order to improve the mixing time. Second, their method
used several parameters chosen heuristically without showing how
these parameters are related to the mixing time. Last, they evalu-
ated only three social graphs which would be too small for making
a general conclusion for all social graphs. We would also like to
point out that they measured only the false acceptance rate (i.e., the
rate of accepted sybil nodes per honest nodes) and not other char-
acteristics, like the rejection rate of honest nodes, which would be
expected to increase with insufﬁcient walk lengths. Experiments
done in the SybilGuard [31] paper are similar.
Lesniewski-Laas et al. [12] also performed experiments on four
large-scale social graphs. They produced CDF of tail edges of ran-
dom walks with varying walk lengths, and expected that as the walk
length approaches O(log n), probabilities that a random walk ends
at a certain edge tend to approach 1/m, the uniform probability
over edges. But the convergence is very loose; they claim that as
the walk length approaches 801, each CDF approaches the ideal
uniform distribution, but among the social networks in their mea-
surement, at least the LiveJournal result shows the distribution is
very far from uniform at the walk length 80. The other three results
also allow a lot of deviations from the uniform distribution which
make it unlikely that the total variation distance between the dis-
tribution and the uniform distribution is close to 0. In short, they
provided raw measurements but did not relate the distribution of
the sampled tails to the stationary distribution itself, in terms of the
variation distance.2
Recently, and concurrent to this work, Viswanath et al. con-
ducted an experimental analysis of sybil defenses based on social
networks in [27]. Their study aimed at comparing different de-
fenses (namely, SybilGuard [32], SybilLimit [30], SybilInfer [3],
and SumUp [23]) independent of the data sets being used, by de-
composing these defenses to their cores. They show that the dif-
ferent Sybil defenses work by ranking different nodes based on
how well-connected are these nodes to a trusted node (the veriﬁer).
Also, they show that the different Sybil defenses are sensitive to
community structure in social networks and community detection
algorithms can be used to replace the random walk based Sybil de-
fenses.
In conclusion, results on the poor performance of Sybil
defenses when applied to community structure possessing social
graphs agree with our ﬁndings, where we show that such networks
are slow mixing.
3. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we formalize the network model. We deﬁne the
mixing time of a random walk on a graph, and we also deﬁne the
fast mixing property of a graph.
3.1 Network model
The social network can be viewed as an undirected graph G =
(V, E) where V is the set of nodes (social actors) in the graph and
E is the set of edges (relationships or interdependencies) between
the nodes. The size of the graph n = |V | and the number of edges
in G is m = |E|. We deﬁne the degree of a node vi ∈ V as the
number of nodes in V adjacent to vi and denote it by deg(vi). For
G, we deﬁne the stochastic transition probability matrix P = [pij]
of size n × n where the (i, j)th entry in P is the probability of
moving from node vi to node vj deﬁned as
(cid:2)
pij =
1
deg(vi)
0
if vi is adjacent to vj,
otherwise.

3.2 Mixing time
In this subsection we recall deﬁnitions of some notions about
random walks on graphs. For more detailed exposition, see [21].
The “event” of moving from a node to another in the graph is
captured by the Markov chain which represents a random walk over
the graph G. A random walk R of length k over G is a sequence
of vertices in G begining from an initial node vi and ending at
vt, the terminal node, following the transition probability deﬁned
in (1). The Markov chain is said to be ergodic if it is irreducible
and aperiodic. In that case, it has a unique stationary distribution
π and the distribution after random walk of length k converges to
1While 80 is much larger than log n when n is close to one million,
one possibility is that this may be due to the hidden constant.
2While [12] uses a different measure, called the separation dis-
tance, and does not require  to be too small, the necessary quality
of the mixing time is not measured in [12].

a probability distribution that is invariant to the transition matrix
P (i.e., πP = π). The mixing time of the Markov chain, T is
deﬁned as the minimal length of the random walk in order to reach
the stationary distribution. More precisely, Deﬁnition 1 states the
mixing time of a Markov chain on G parameterized by a variation
distance parameter .

(MIXING TIME). The mixing time (parameter-
ized by ) of a Markov chain is deﬁned as

T () = max

t|1  λ2 ≥ ··· ≥
λn−1 ≥ λn > −1 holds. We deﬁne the second largest eigen-
value μ as μ = max (|λ2|,|λn−1|). Then, the mixing time T () is
bounded by:

Mixing time versus connectivity: The mixing time is tightly re-
lated to the connectivity of the graph. This is, strongly-connected
graphs are fast mixing (i.e., have small mixing time) while the
weakly connected graphs are slow mixing and have large mixing
time [21]. Also, the second largest eigenvalue used for measuring
the mixing time bounds the graph conductance, a measure for the
community structure [27]. In short, the conductance is Φ ≥ 1 − μ.
3.3 Measuring the mixing time of social graphs
Measuring the mixing time, especially of large graphs, is a cum-
bersome task and that might be the reason why fewer efforts are
made to measure this essential property in large social graphs. In
order to measure the mixing time of a social graph, we begin by the
deﬁnition itself in (2). We follow the deﬁnition, by starting from
an initial distribution concentrated on a node vi, and compute the
distribution after the random walk of length t with t large enough
so that the variation distance between the distribution after random
walk and the stationary distribution is within . We repeat this for
different initial points. This approach is feasible for not too small ,
because we may then expect long walk length for this computation.
Since the mixing time is deﬁned as the maximum necessary walk
length to achieve  distance for different initial states, one such
random walk would be enough to establish a lower bound of the
mixing time. Since we are interested in how large the mixing time
should be, in principle only one random walk could be enough, if
the walk length is sufﬁciently large. But in order to understand the
general tendency and distribution of walk lengths, we repeat this
many times (i.e., 1000) by picking an initial node randomly and
perform the above computation. The end result obtained using this
technique gives intuition about the tendency of the mixing time.
As a complementary method for bounding the mixing time (for
even smaller  and also for comparing with the previous results), we
also use the method described in Theorem 2. First, we compute the
second largest eigenvalue modulus (SLEM) of the transition matrix
P . Given that the matrix P is sparse, we found that the computation
of SLEM is feasible for graphs with a million nodes (as is the case
for largest graphs we used). Once we compute SLEM, we use the
lower bound in (4) to bound the mixing time of the graph.
3.4 Social graphs—the data sets
The social graphs used in our experiments are in Table 1. These
graphs are selected to feature two models of knowledge between
nodes in the social networks. These networks are categorized as
follows. (1) social networks that exhibit knowledge between nodes
and are good for the trust assumptions of the Sybil defenses; e.g.,
physics co-authorships and DBLP. These are slow mixing, as we
will see later. (2) Graphs of networks that may not require face-to-
face knowledge but require interaction; e.g., Youtube and Livejour-
nal. Closely related to those is the set of graphs that may not require
prior knowledge between nodes or where the social links between
nodes are less meaningful to the context of the Sybil defenses; e.g.,
Facebook and wiki-vote, which are shown to be fast mixing.
