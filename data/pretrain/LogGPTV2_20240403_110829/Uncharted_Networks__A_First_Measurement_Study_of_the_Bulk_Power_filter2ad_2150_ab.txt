only supports 54. In addition, an ASDU also contains the
Cause Of Transmission (COT), such as periodic (e.g., a
periodic reporting of the voltage), spontaneous (e.g., the cur-
rent exceeded a pre-configured threshold), or interrogation
(exchanging values based on a request by the other party). In
short, ASDU typeID specifies "what" type of data/command
is being sent and COT specifies "why" it is being sent.
S-Format APDUs are basically acknowledgments after a spe-
cific (but configurable) number of I-Format APDUs have
been received.

U-Format APDUs provide three connection control functions:
(1) they can start the transmission of I-Format APDUs via
a STARTDT act message (which is acknowledged with a
STARTDT con message); (2) stop the transfer of I-Format
APUDs with the STOPDT act message (also acknowledged
with a STOPDT con message), and (3) send keep-alive con-
nection requests with the TESTFR act message (which is ac-
knowledged with a TESTFR con message). Newly established
(or switchover) connections are by default in a "STOPDT"
state.
talking with the control center of the power company via the ICCP
industrial protocol). The substations that use IEC 101 or IEC 104 to
connect directly with the system operator, do so because to allow
AGC control of their generators. In this paper we focus on these
substations; in particular the ones with IEC 104 (we cannot observe
the substations that use IEC 101 because they do not show up in
our network tap).
Figure 4: Primary and Secondary Connections in IEC 104.
In high reliability networks, IEC 104 typically maintains a pri-
mary connection between a server and an RTU and a secondary
(redundant connection) with another server as illustrated in Fig. 4.
The primary connection is used to send I messages, which also
include S messages (acks) and occasionally U messages. The sec-
ondary connection only sends periodic U TESTFR messages to test
the status of the connection (a keep-alive message). If at any point
in time the backup control server C2 sends the U STARTDT con
message, then the connection to server C2 becomes the primary
connection or the RTU and the connection to C1 becomes the sec-
ondary connection. This behavior and the establishment of a TCP
flow is determined by four timers.
• T0: Timeout of connection establishment (default at 30 sec).
Expiration of this timer will trigger a TCP-SYN request to
establish a new connection.
• T1: Timeout of send or test APDUs (default at 15 sec). Expi-
ration of this timer will trigger an active close request, or a
connection change request by a controlling station, resulting
in the start of a new redundant connection and an automatic
switch over.
• T2: Time out for acknowledgements (default at 10 sec and
T2 ). To our surprise, when we attempted to measure the
