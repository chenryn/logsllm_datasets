Abstract. A new interesting research area is the representation and
analysis of the networked economy using Open Semantic Service Net-
works (OSSN). OSSN are represented using the service description lan-
guage USDL to model nodes and using the service relationship model
OSSR to model edges. Nonetheless, in their current form USDL and
OSSR do not provide constructs to capture the dynamic behavior of
service networks. To bridge this gap, we used the General System The-
ory (GST) as a framework guiding the extension of USDL and OSSR
to model dynamic OSSN. We evaluated the extensions made by apply-
ing USDL and OSSR to two distinct types of dynamic OSSN analysis:
1) evolutionary by using a Preferential Attachment (PA) and 2) ana-
lytical by using concepts from System Dynamics (SD). Results indicate
that OSSN can constitute the first stepping stones toward the analysis
of global service-based economies.

1 Introduction
Networks have been playing an increasingly important role in many fields. The

life of many people. Service networks are another class of networks of emerging
interest since worldwide economies are becoming increasingly connected.
To address the growing importance of service systems, we have introduced
the concept of Open Semantic Service Network (OSSN)[2]. OSSNs are global
service networks which relate services with the assumption that firms make the

information of their service systems openly available using suitable models. Ser-
vice systems, relationships, and networks are said to be open when their mod-
els are transparently available and accessible by external entities and follow an
open-worldassumption.Theobjectiveofopenservicesisverysimilartotheone
explored by the linked open data initiative: exposing, sharing, and connecting
pieces of data and information on the Semantic Web using URIs and RDF.
One limitation of OSSNs is that they were conceived without accounting for
the dynamic behavior of service networks. In other words, they can only cap-
ture static snapshots of service-based economies. In this paper, our objective is
to bridge this gap by bringing dynamic modeling capabilities to OSSNs. Our
approach explores the General System Theory (GST)[3], a theory successfully
applied in many fields of research (e.g. by John Von Neumann in computing
and Ed Yourdon in structured analysis and structured design), to identify im-
portant requirements to model dynamic service networks. From these require-
ments, we studied the suitability of using USDL1 (Unified Service Description
Language)[4,5,6]andOSSR2 (OpenSemanticServiceRelationship)[7]torep-
resent dynamic service networks. USDL is a language which provides machine-
processable descriptions for service systems. With the introduction of USDL
there is a paradigm shift which sees that business services can be represented
and controlled using guiding specifications. OSSR systematizes key elements to
establish rich relationships between service systems such as the role of services
(e.g. consumer, competitor, and complementor), the strength of relationships,
and the level at which service systems are related (e.g. activities and actors).
Based on our study of GST, both USDL and OSSR models were extended
with primitives to capture the dynamic behavior of open semantic service net-
works. Three extensions were identified: 1) attractiveness, 2) cause-effect rela-
tionships,and3)timebounding.Wevalidatedourapproachwithtwoscenarios.

(PA)[8], while the second used System Dynamics (SD)[9] to forecast the behav-
iorofanOSSN.Therelationsbetweenthevarioustheoriesandmodelsexplored

opments – such as USDL, OSSR, and OSSN – have reached a maturity stage
which enables the implementation of algorithms and simulation models to gain
insights on the evolution of global service networks.

2 Motivation Scenario
A service network can be defined as a graph structure made up of service sys-
tems which are nodes, connected by one or more specific types of relationships.

The dynamic nature of service networks indicates that their topology might
be shaped according to some intrinsic property, e.g. service cost, availability, or
extrinsic property, e.g. perceived customer preference. This dynamic behavior
has been verified in many fields. For example, the world-wide web forms a large
directed graph with an apparent random character. Nonetheless, the topology
of this graph has evolved to a scale-free network [10] by preferential attachment
[8],i.e.whenestablishinghyperlinks,documentspreferthe’popularity’ofcertain
documents (of ’popular sites’) which overtime become hubs.
In service networks, we can hypothesize that a similar mechanism to the
one describing the evolution of the web can also explain their evolution. Ser-
vice networks are appropriate models of networked societies whereby consumers
adopt a service system on the basis of its value proposition (e.eg a preferen-
4 Jorge Cardoso et al.
tial attachment) since it was argued that networks are an implicit element of a
service-dominant logic [11]. Thus, the competition between one type of network

eventually leads the service network to some stable fixed point, to a cyclic,

Finding the mechanisms, laws, and properties of dynamic service networks can
enable to better understand and explain why some service networks survive,
prosper, decline or die.
3 Related Work
e3service and e3value [12, 13] provide ontologies to represent e-business mod-
els, services, and the value exchanged within companies. The e3value model
places emphasis on wants, benefits, needs, and demand. Nonetheless, to model
networks, a more detailed description of services is needed and should include
aspects such as pricing, quality levels, and legal constraints. On the other hand,
e3service targets to represent very simple relations between services from an in-
ternalperspective,e.g.core-enhancing,core-supporting,andsubstitute.Froman
external perspective, the value chains proposed do not capture explicitly service
networks across agents and do not try to analyse quantitatively the effect of
relationships. Therefore, service network analysis is not possible. The e3service
and e3value approaches fail to adhere to service-dominant logic and focus too
much inward the company instead of the large-scale network they belong to.
In [14], the authors look at service networks from a Business Process Man-
agement (BPM) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) perspectives, and
present the Service Network Notation (SNN). SNN provides UML artifacts to
model value chain relationships of economic value. These relationships take the
form of what we can call ’weak’ relationships since they only capture offerings
and rewards which occur between service systems. The focus is on composition,
processes, and on establishing how new services can be created using BPM to
describe the interactions of existing SOA-based services. On the other hand,

Allee [15] uses a graph-based notation to model value flows inside a network
of agents such as the exchange of goods, services, revenue, knowledge, and in-
tangible values. The approach only takes into account value flows and does not
consider other types of relationships that can be established between agents.
Furthermore, the automatic machine-processing of services and flows was not
a concern, hence limiting the applicability of the approach to the analysis of
distributed large-scale networks.

4 Theoretical Foundations
Due to its wide applicability to various domains, we used the General System
Theory as a guiding framework to represent service systems and networks. We
first analysed the properties proposed by the GST, i.e. wholeness, interdepen-
dence, hierarchy, self-regulation and control, interchange with the environment,
balance/homeostasis, change and adaptability, and equifinality. Our analysis
identified three important requirements: internal service relationships (R1), ex-
ternal relationships with other service systems (R2), and system dynamics and
change (R3).
Internal Relationships (R1). A service modeling language needs to establish
cause-effectrelationsbetweentheinternalelementsofthemachineryofaservice
system that range from participants, to information, to resources, to legal as-
pects,andtopricing.Theseelementsareinterdependent.Forexample,achange
in the quality level of one activity of a service’s business process can produce
changes in the cost of another related activity.
External Relationships (R2). A comprehensive modeling requires facility in es-
tablishing cause-effect relations between internal- and external service systems.
For example, if two services have established a relationship at the operational
level and one service depends on the other, then the quality level delivered by
one of the services depends on the quality level of the other.
Understanding Change (R3). To ignore the centrality of change overtime is to
limit the modeling of service networks as snapshots that are alienated from
reality. Time needs to be an integral modeling element. Another aspect is the
attractiveness of a service (see Chapter 10 of [18]). It is relevant since it has
been shown in other areas (e.g. the Web, business, and social networks) that a
network may grow by adding relationships - not randomly, but by attraction or
