**Abstract:**
The representation and analysis of the networked economy using Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSNs) is an emerging research area. OSSNs are modeled using the Unified Service Description Language (USDL) for nodes and the Open Semantic Service Relationship (OSSR) model for edges. However, USDL and OSSR in their current forms do not capture the dynamic behavior of service networks. To address this, we employed General System Theory (GST) as a guiding framework to extend USDL and OSSR for dynamic modeling. We evaluated these extensions by applying them to two types of dynamic OSSN analysis: 1) evolutionary analysis using Preferential Attachment (PA) and 2) analytical methods using System Dynamics (SD). Our results indicate that OSSNs can serve as a foundation for analyzing global service-based economies.

### 1. Introduction

Networks have become increasingly significant across various fields, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, social networks, and Linked Open Data (LOD). Service networks, which represent the interconnectedness of worldwide economies, are of particular interest. To address this, we introduced the concept of Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSNs), which are global service networks where firms make their service system information openly available using suitable models. These systems, relationships, and networks are considered open when their models are transparently available and accessible, following an open-world assumption. The goal of open services is similar to that of the linked open data initiative: exposing, sharing, and connecting data and information on the Semantic Web using URIs and RDF.

One limitation of OSSNs is their inability to account for the dynamic behavior of service networks, capturing only static snapshots of service-based economies. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing dynamic modeling capabilities to OSSNs. We use General System Theory (GST) to identify key requirements for modeling dynamic service networks. Based on these requirements, we extended USDL and OSSR to capture dynamic behavior. Three extensions were identified: attractiveness, cause-effect relationships, and time bounding. We validated our approach with two scenarios: one based on an evolutionary analysis using Preferential Attachment (PA) and the other using System Dynamics (SD) to forecast OSSN behavior. Our findings suggest that USDL, OSSR, and OSSN have reached a maturity stage that enables the implementation of algorithms and simulation models to gain insights into the evolution of global service networks.

### 2. Motivation Scenario

A service network is a graph structure consisting of service systems as nodes, connected by specific types of relationships. A service system is a self-contained representation of a repeatable business activity, aggregating people, processes, resources, regulations, and equipment to create value for both consumers and providers. Service systems can rely on other service systems to operate, interacting via value propositions and shared information.

The dynamic nature of service networks suggests that their topology may be shaped by intrinsic properties (e.g., service cost, availability) or extrinsic properties (e.g., perceived customer preference). For example, the World Wide Web has evolved into a scale-free network through preferential attachment, where documents prefer linking to more popular sites. Similarly, in service networks, the competition between providers for consumer attention, mediated by preferential attachment, drives an emergent dynamic process leading to stable, cyclic, or chaotic topologies. Understanding the mechanisms, laws, and properties of dynamic service networks can help explain why some service networks survive, prosper, decline, or fail.

### 3. Related Work

**e3service and e3value:**
These ontologies represent e-business models, services, and the value exchanged within companies. While e3value focuses on wants, benefits, needs, and demand, it lacks detailed descriptions of services, such as pricing, quality levels, and legal constraints. e3service, on the other hand, represents simple internal relations but fails to capture external service networks and quantitative relationship effects, limiting its applicability to large-scale network analysis.

**Service Network Notation (SNN):**
SNN provides UML artifacts to model value chain relationships, focusing on composition and process interactions. However, it only captures weak relationships (offerings and rewards) and does not describe how services relate in service markets.

**Allee's Graph-Based Notation:**
This approach models value flows within a network of agents, but it does not consider other types of relationships and lacks machine-processing capabilities, limiting its applicability to distributed large-scale networks.

**Other Models:**
Researchers have formalized models to capture business networks, such as those by Weiner and Weisbecker, which address value networks, market interfaces, and financial aspects. However, these models focus on textual or conceptual representations and do not explore automatic machine-processing.

### 4. Theoretical Foundations

We used General System Theory (GST) as a guiding framework to represent service systems and networks. GST proposes several properties, including wholeness, interdependence, hierarchy, self-regulation, interchange with the environment, balance/homeostasis, change, and adaptability. Our analysis identified three key requirements:

1. **Internal Relationships (R1):** A service modeling language must establish cause-effect relationships between the internal elements of a service system, such as participants, information, resources, legal aspects, and pricing. These elements are interdependent, and changes in one can affect others.

2. **External Relationships (R2):** Comprehensive modeling requires establishing cause-effect relationships between internal and external service systems. For example, if two services are operationally related, the quality level of one service depends on the quality level of the other.

3. **Understanding Change (R3):** Ignoring the centrality of change over time limits the modeling of service networks to static snapshots. Time must be an integral part of the model. Additionally, the attractiveness of a service is relevant, as it has been shown in other areas (e.g., the Web, business, and social networks) that networks grow by adding relationships, not randomly, but by attraction.
