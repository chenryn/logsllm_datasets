Need for Post Exploitation 
• The most important part of a penetration test. 
• Guy who will pay you $$$ do not understand 
technology (neither he wants to). A “shell” is 
not what he wants from you. 
• IMHO, this differentiates a good pen tester 
and one-click-i-pwn-you-omg pen tester. 
• Etc Etc

PowerShell 
• A shell and scripting language present by 
default on new Windows machines. 
• Designed to automate things and make life 
easier for system admins. 
• Based on .Net framework and is tightly 
integrated with Windows.

Why PowerShell? 
• Provides access to almost everything in a 
Windows platform which could be useful for an 
attacker. 
• Easy to learn and really powerful. 
• Trusted by the countermeasures and system 
administrators. 
• Consider it bash of Windows. 
• Less dependence on msf and 
-to-executable libraries.

Powerpreter - Introduction 
• A post exploitation tool written completely in 
powershell. 
• To be a part of Nishang, powershell based post 
exploitation framework, written by the 
speaker. 
• The name is similar to meterpreter. 
Powerpreter wants to be like meterpreter 
after growing up :)

Powerpreter - Architecture 
• Powerpreter is a powershell module and/or 
script depending on the usage. 
• Payloads and features in powerpreter are 
structured as functions. Separate function for 
each functionality. 
• A bare bones powerpreter is also included 
which downloads the functionality as and 
when required.

Powerpreter – Usage 
• Powerpreter is best used from a Powershell 
Remote Session. 
• It could be imported as a module and the 
functionalities get loaded in the current 
session. 
• It could also be used from meterpreter.

Limitations 
• Yet to undergo community testing. 
• Keylogger does not work from powershell 
remote session. 
• Backdoors can be detected with careful traffic 
analysis.

Conclusion 
• Powershell provides much control over a 
Windows system and Windows based network 
• Powerpreter has been designed its power 
from above fact and provides (or at least 
attempts to) a useful set of features for 
penetration testers.
