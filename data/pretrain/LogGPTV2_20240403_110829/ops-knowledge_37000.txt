User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do you force an update to a user's group membership in Windows 7? I am writing a web application that uses .NET Windows Authentication and relies on a user's group membership to Authorize them to various areas of the website.  Right now I'm on a dev machine that IS NOT part of a domain and is not using AD, instead I'm just using local user groups.  In general this is working fine as is.

However, as I test the application I need to add and remove roles in my user account to verify things are working.  When I add a role it doesn't seem to propagate until I log out of Windows and login again.

Is it possible to force an update to Group membership without having to log off?

Assistant: taskkill.exe /F /IM explorer.exe
runas /user:%USERDOMAIN%\%USERNAME% explorer.exe


This will kill explorer, then reopen with your user account... It will prompt you for your password and that will get you a new token, thereby updating your membership.
