the use of similar metrics to those of Space Syntax. Carefully
vetted traceroute measurements allow us to derive partial
AS-level connectivity graphs that highlight the actual routes
traversed by data packets. Given that the popularity
of a route on the Internet can serve as an informative
proxy for the volume of traﬃc it carries, we argue that
by concentrating on all the AS-level paths that traverse
a speciﬁc AS, the application of graph structural metrics
can help us identify the popular links connected to those
networks.
We would not expect, however, that the direct application
of these metrics to just any undirected AS-level graph of the
Internet (such as one derived from BGP data) would yield
similar results.
Indeed, as we show in Section 7.1, using
a non-uniform line representation of AS-level connectivity
and analyzing it by measures that are essentially topological
ignores too much contextual
information to be useful.
The mere direct connectivity between two ASes says little
about the utilization of those links for carrying traﬃc
between diﬀerent parts of the Internet, especially when
many important deciding factors such as routing policy are
ignored. After all, as has been pointed out, there are dangers
in taking available data at face value while ignoring domain-
speciﬁc context [47].
3.3 Connectivity Graphs and Metrics
At a high-level, Network Syntax metrics are applied to
connectivity graphs generated for speciﬁc ASes by extracting
the set of AS-level paths present in a traceroute dataset that
traverse each individual AS. Each of the diﬀerent AS-level

while the intersection between AS-links (the Autonomous
Systems they interconnect) are represented as edges.
paths is broken down into pairs of hops which represent a
link between those ASes. The connectivity graph is gener-
ated by adopting a dual representation where each AS-link
is transformed into a node, while the intersection between
AS-links (the Autonomous Systems they interconnect) are
represented as edges. Figure 2 shows a connectivity graph
for a subset of important AS-links.
Metrics. The diﬀerent metrics take a speciﬁc meaning
in the context of the dual representation of the AS-level
connectivity-graph.
Connectivity.
In this context, captures the number of
diﬀerent AS-links that precede or succeed each AS-link in
the graph. A high connectivity indirectly captures the
diversity of the diﬀerent end-to-end AS-level paths that
traverse the link.
Control value of an AS-link is deﬁned as the sum of
the reciprocal of its neighbors’ connectivity.
Similar to
connectivity, it captures the diversity of the AS-level paths
that traverse the AS-link by considering the diﬀerent AS-
links that precede or follow its directly connected links.
Global choice measures the popularity of a link by looking
at how likely it is to be passed through on all shortest paths
from all other AS-links in the network. Important links will
lie on a high proportion of paths between other AS-links in
the network.
Integration attempts to capture link popularity by looking
at the average distance from each AS-link to every other AS-
link in the connectivity graph. Using this metric, important
links are identiﬁed as those that are typically “close” (on
average) to other AS-links in the network.
ALTP-frequency. In our context, the popularity of an AS-
link can also be captured by the number of diﬀerent end-to-
end AS-level paths (discovered by the probes of a traceroute
campaign) that traverse the particular link. That is, the
frequency of AS-link Traversing Paths, or ALTP-frequency.
This metric is speciﬁc to Network Syntax and seems to have
no obvious or commonly known parallel in either graph
theory or Space Syntax. We describe how to compute
ALTP-frequency in Section 4.3.

4. FROM NETWORK SYNTAX TO INTER-
DOMAIN TRAFFIC
In this section, we start with a description of our datasets:
a collection of traceroutes launched from topologically di-
verse vantage points and the traﬃc datasets we rely on for
ground truth. We describe then how we leverage the AS-
level paths gathered by the probes of traceroute datasets to
derive a connectivity graph upon which core Network Syntax
metrics can be applied.
4.1 Datasets
We evaluate Network Syntax using a traceroute dataset
and traﬃc data, our ground-truth, from two large network
entities: a large European IXP and a global ISP.
Traceroutes. Our traceroute datasets consist of data
collected in two diﬀerence campaigns by topologically di-
verse vantage points.
It contains the probes launched
towards randomly selected IP addresses from the Ono
BitTorrent extension [18]. Ono peers perform measurements
to randomly selected destinations from the set of connections
established through BitTorrent. The datasets consist of all
the measurements gathered between two 30-day periods in
two diﬀerent years – April 1 to 30, 2011 and April 1 to 30,
2013. Table 1 shows a summary of both datasets. The ﬁrst
one consists of ≈12.9 million probes launched by 116,978
distinct vantage points located in 2,143 unique ASes. The
second dataset includes ≈13.8 million probes launched from
51,884 diﬀerent vantage points located in 1,351 diﬀerent
networks.
Traﬃc. To validate our approach, we perform our analysis
in the context of a large European IXP (IXP ) and a
global Tier-1 Internet Service Provider (ISP ). Ground-
truth traﬃc data for IXP consists of sFlow [30] records,
collected over 1-week periods in April 2011 and April 2013,
capturing the traﬃc exchanged over the public peering fabric
of the IXP. Using a random sampling of 1/16K packets, the
resulting traﬃc matrix contains the estimated number of
bytes exchanged between pairs of ASes peering at the IXP.
This detailed information allows us to rank the peerings
based on the volume of (bi-directional) traﬃc they exchange.
The ground-truth data for ISP consists of the traﬃc
exchanged between the ISP and all
its customer ASes.
The data contains per-customer link utilization from SNMP
records for April 2011 and April 2013, and includes the 95th
percentile utilization during the course of the month of the
hourly port utilizations. Traﬃc data is summarized on a
per-customer basis using link aggregation across diﬀerent
physical interfaces for customers with multiple links.
4.2 Methodology
This traceroute-derived AS-level graph is “partial” in that it
does not capture the complete connectivity graph. Since an
AS-level path is a sequence of AS-level links, we call such
AS-level paths ALTPs, for AS-link Traversing Paths.
The following paragraphs formally deﬁne ALTPs and
describe how they are extracted from traceroute datasets
and how they are used to generate a partial connectivity
graph.

AS-link Traversing Paths (ALTPs). Formally, an AS-
level path can be deﬁned as a sequence of unique AS-level
links, each connecting a pair of ASes. We denote an AS-
level path as (cid:104)as1, as2, ..., ask(cid:105). We deﬁne an ALT P (x, y)
as an AS-level path that traverses the AS-link (cid:104)x, y(cid:105), i.e.,
(cid:104)as1, ..., x, y, ..., ask(cid:105). Note that (cid:104)as1, ..., x, y, ..., ask(cid:105) and
(cid:104)ask, ..., y, x, ..., as1(cid:105) are considered two diﬀerent ALTPs.
Figure 3 shows an example of such a path. The ALTP
abstraction is directly applicable to paths that traverse an
IXP whose presence is identiﬁed by the preﬁx assigned by
the responsible Internet Registry. The set of all unique
ALTPs found in a dataset that traverse a speciﬁc AS-link is
called the ALTP-set of that link.
From probes to AS-level paths. We extract AS-level
paths from diﬀerent traceroute datasets using public IP-to-
AS mapping and correcting for inconsistencies with BGP
information [17].
For paths that traverse an IXP, we
follow [10] to assign conﬁdence levels to the discovered IXP-
peerings.
We ﬁrst prune our dataset by eliminating loops and cycles
and ﬁltering private and reserved IP ranges and remove the
associated hops if they appear at the ends of the probe. We
convert IP-level to AS-level paths using the AS mapping
derived from publicly available BGP information. From the
derived set we then conservatively remove any probes with
unknown AS-hops in the path, probes for which the source
or destination AS cannot be mapped3, and probes for which
the ﬁnal AS-level path is too short (probes within the same
AS).
We then apply known heuristics [17] to correct the set of
AS-level paths, but preserving the IP addresses belonging to
known IXP hops. IXP mapping requires a complete list of
preﬁxes assigned to the diﬀerent IXPs and the list of their
AS members which we obtain from centralized databases
like PCH [2], PeeringDb [3] and EuroIX [1], and websites
maintained by the IXPs themselves. We remove obsolete
We generate the partial connectivity graph for a particular
ASX from the total set of AS-level paths that include ASX,
i.e., paths that include AS-level links that connect to ASX.
3Since the removed links appear only in the discarded paths,
they are not popular and their removal has no impact on our
ﬁndings.

names that represent the same entity. We assign conﬁdence
levels to the discovered IXP peerings following the approach
in [10] labeling as high-conﬁdence those peerings for which
we have probes traversing the peering in both directions
or those for which the ASes at both sides of the peering
have been identiﬁed as members of the IXP from BGP data
collected at the IXP. For our analysis we consider only these
high-conﬁdence peerings.
AS-Link connectivity graphs. To generate the connec-
tivity graph for the various Autonomous Systems we extract
the set of ALTPs present in the dataset that traverse links
connected to each speciﬁc AS. As described in Section 3.2,
each diﬀerent ALTP is broken down into pairs of hops which
represent a link between those ASes, and a dual-connectivity
graph is generated where each AS-link is transformed into a
node, while the intersection between links (the Autonomous
Systems they interconnect) are represented as edges.
4.3 Computing ALTP-frequency
Having introduced partial connectivity graphs and for-
mally deﬁned ALTPs, we can now describe how to compute
the Network Syntax ALTP-frequency metric. Using the
derived set of AS-level paths, we compute the ALTP-sets
for all the AS-links of interest found in those paths.
The relative cardinality of the ALTP-set of an AS-link, in
a set S, is the cardinality of its ALTP-set divided by the
sum of the cardinalities of the ALTP-sets of every AS-link
in S. This relative cardinality is what we refer to as ALTP-
frequency.
5. EVALUATION
In this section, we apply the approach outlined in Sec-
tions 3 and 4 to the links of IXP and ISP present in our
2011 and 2013 traceroute datasets, we then analyze the rela-
tion between the diﬀerent Network Syntax metrics and the
links’ traﬃc volumes. Note that the idea of route popularity
applies equally well to physical and logical AS-links between
ASes. As a result, the Network Syntax approach can be
applied in both our IXP and ISP scenarios for which the
available measurements provide ground truth about traﬃc
traversing physical and logical AS-links, respectively.
In our analysis, we rely on a number of statistical tech-
niques that assume normally distributed variables. However,
as we show next, this assumption does not necessarily
hold for all the variables we are interested in. A well-
known remedy for failure of normality expected by many
parametric tests [9, 28, 44] is to apply appropriately-chosen
transformations.
In our analysis, whenever necessary, we
use the most appropriate transformation for the diﬀerent
variables.
5.1 Trafﬁc distribution
We ﬁrst look at the traﬃc distribution for the subset of
AS-links discovered by the diﬀerent traceroute campaigns
for both ISP and IXP . We extract from the corresponding
traﬃc matrix (derived from the ground-truth traﬃc data)
the amount of traﬃc each link carries, and generate a
histogram of their traﬃc distribution. Figure 4 shows this
histogram for the links of IXP discovered by the April 2011
