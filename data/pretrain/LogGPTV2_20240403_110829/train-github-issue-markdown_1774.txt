The `DatePickerDialog` is a well-designed date picker component that is currently only utilized internally within the `DatePicker` component. It would be beneficial to make this component accessible to users of `material-ui`, rather than restricting its use to internal purposes.

Additionally, I propose that the `open` state of the `DatePickerDialog` should be controlled via a prop. Relying solely on instance methods to open and close the dialog can be cumbersome and less flexible. By allowing the `open` state to be managed through a prop, we can provide a more user-friendly and versatile experience for developers.
