The `DatePickerDialog` is a very nice date picker component. Currently, it's
only available to be used internally in the `DatePicker` component. It would
be nice to have it as a component that can be used by consumers of `material-
ui`, not just internally.
I also think that the `open` state should be controlled via a prop. It's
pretty nasty to have the component only be able to opened / closed via
instance methods.
