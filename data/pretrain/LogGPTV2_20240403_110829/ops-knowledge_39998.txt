Assistant: The following are the steps to configure Nginx reverse proxy server on one server to support multiple virtual hosts: 1. Install Nginx Install Nginx on the server and make sure the Nginx service is started. 2. Create two virtual hosts Create two virtual hosts in the Nginx configuration file. Each virtual host needs to have its own server_name and proxy_pass configuration. For example, the configuration for the first virtual host might look like this: server { listen 80; server_name example1.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; } } The configuration for the second virtual host is similar, but server_name and proxy_pass need to be configured according to your needs. 3. Reload the configuration After completing the configuration, use the following command to reload the Nginx configuration: sudo nginx -s reload 4. Test the reverse proxy Now you can test whether the reverse proxy is working properly. Visit your web hosting domain name in a browser and you should be able to successfully access your web application. If you have multiple virtual hosts, you can access them using different domain names or subdomains. The above are the steps to configure the Nginx reverse proxy server on one server to support multiple virtual hosts.
