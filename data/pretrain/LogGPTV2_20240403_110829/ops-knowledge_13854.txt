User: Please design a reliable network topology to ensure that the company's business will not be affected by network failures.
Assistant: reliable network topology should take into account the following aspects: 1. High availability: The network topology should adopt a redundant design to ensure that the entire network can automatically switch to a backup trunk line when a trunk line fails to ensure business continuity. continuity. 2. Security: Ensure the security and integrity of sensitive data in the network by using firewalls, access control, and encryption technologies. 3. Optimizing network performance: Network topology design should be based on different business needs, select the most suitable network protocol, equipment and technology, and optimize network performance. 4. Stability: The network topology should be able to automatically detect and repair faults to ensure stable network operation and reduce manual intervention by administrators. A common reliable network topology diagram is as follows: ![image-20210910112436667](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daniel-34/typora_img/main/img/image-20210910112436667.png) The network topology consists of the following Parts: 1. Edge layer: This is the first layer that connects terminal devices to the network. Devices at this level usually include switches, routers, and firewalls. The main job of the edge layer is to provide functions such as terminal device access and access control. 2. Core layer: The core layer is the center of the network, which is responsible for connecting the edge layer and the data center layer, ensuring fast data transmission and failover. 3. Data center layer: The data center layer is the data storage, processing, and distribution center, including servers, storage devices, and load balancers. 4. Redundant links: In order to improve the availability and fault tolerance of the network, redundant links can be set between different network layers to ensure that when the main link fails, the backup link can automatically switch and take over the data traffic. This network topology has the advantages of high availability, security, optimized network performance, and stability, and can be applied to network environments such as large enterprises, data centers, and cloud platforms.
