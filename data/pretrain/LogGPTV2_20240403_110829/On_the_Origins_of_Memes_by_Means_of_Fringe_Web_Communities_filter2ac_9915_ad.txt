hence covering a relatively good sample of our datasets. Donald
Trump [29], Smug Frog [47], and Pepe the Frog [40] appear in the
top 20 for all three communities, while the Happy Merchant [32]
only in /pol/ and Gab. In particular, Donald Trump annotates the
most clusters (207 in /pol/, 177 in The_Donald, and 25 in Gab). In
fact, politics-related entries appear several times in the Table, e.g.,
Make America Great Again [36] as well as political personalities
like Bernie Sanders, Obama, Putin, and Hillary Clinton.
When comparing the different communities, we observe the most
prevalent categories are memes (6 to 14 entries in each community)
and people (2-5). Moreover, in /pol/, the 2nd most popular entry,
related to people, is Adolf Hilter, which supports previous reports
of the community’s sympathetic views toward Nazi ideology [20].
Overall, there are several memes with hateful or disturbing content
(e.g., holocaust). This happens to a lesser extent in The_Donald and
Gab: the most popular people after Donald Trump are contemporary
politicians.
Finally, image posting behavior in fringe Web communities is
greatly influenced by real-world events. For instance, in /pol/, we
find the #TrumpAnime controversy event [50], where a political
individual (Rick Wilson) offended the alt-right community, Donald
Trump supporters, and anime fans (an oddly intersecting set of
interests of /pol/ users). Similarly, on The_Donald and Gab, we find
the #Cnnblackmail [27] event, referring to the (alleged) blackmail
of the Reddit user that created the infamous video of Donald Trump
wrestling the CNN.
4.1.2 Memes’ Branching Nature. Next, we study how memes evolve
by looking at variants across different clusters. Intuitively, clusters
that look alike and/or are part of the same meme are grouped
together under the same branch of an evolutionary tree. We use the

chosen based on the frogs analysis above (see red horizontal line
in Fig. 5). In particular, we select this threshold as the majority of
the clusters from the same meme (note coloration in Fig. 5) are
hierarchically connected with a higher-level cluster at a distance
close to 0.45. To ease readability, we filter out nodes and edges that
have a sum of in- and out-degree less than 10, which leaves 40%
of the nodes and 92% of the edges. Nodes are colored according to
their KYM annotation. NB: the graph is laid out using the OpenOrd
algorithm [58] and the distance between the components in it does
not exactly match the actual distance metric. We observe a large
set of disconnected components, with each component containing
nodes of primarily one color. This indicates that our distance metric
is indeed capturing the peculiarities of different memes. Finally,
note that an interactive version of the full graph is publicly available
from [1].
4.2 Web Community-based Analysis
We now present a macro-perspective analysis of the Web communi-
ties through the lens of memes. We assess the presence of different
memes in each community, how popular they are, and how they
evolve. To this end, we examine the posts from all four communi-
ties (Twitter, Reddit, /pol/, and Gab) that contain images matching
memes from fringe Web communities (/pol/, The_Donald, and Gab).
4.2.1 Meme Popularity. We start by analyzing clusters grouped by
KYM ‘meme’ entries, looking at the number of posts for each meme
in /pol/, Reddit, Gab, and Twitter. (We also include the analysis for
‘people’ entries in the extended version [73].)
Figure 6: Visualization of the obtained clusters from /pol/,
The_Donald, and Gab. Note that memes with red labels are anno-
tated as racist, while memes with green labels are annotated as pol-
itics (see Section 4.2.1 for the selection criteria).
custom distance metric introduced in Sec. 2.3, aiming to infer the
phylogenetic relationship between variants of memes. Since there
are 12.6K annotated clusters, we only report on a subset of variants.
In particular, we focus on “frog” memes (e.g., Pepe the Frog [40]);
as discussed later in Sec. 4.2, this is one of the most popular memes
in our datasets.
The dendrogram in Fig. 5 shows the hierarchical relationship
between groups of clusters of memes related to frogs. Overall, there
are 525 clusters of frogs, belonging to 23 different memes. These
clusters can be grouped into four large categories, dominated by
different memes that express different ideas or messages: e.g., Apu
Apustaja depicts a simple-minded non-native speaker using broken
English, while the Feels Bad Man/Sad Frog (ironically) expresses
dismay at a given situation. The dendrogram also shows a variant
of Smug Frog (smug-frog-b) related to a variant of the Russian Anti
Meme Law [46] (anti-meme) as well as relationships between clus-
ters from Pepe the Frog and Isis meme [33], and between Smug Frog
and Brexit-related clusters [51], as shown in Appendix E in [73].
The distance metric quantifies the similarity of any two variants
of different memes; however, recall that two clusters can be close
to each other even when the medoids are perceptually different
(see Sec. 2.3), as in the case of Smug Frog variants in the smug-frog-
a and smug-frog-b clusters (top of Fig. 5). Although, due to space
constraints, this analysis is limited to a single “family” of memes, our
distance metric can actually provide useful insights regarding the
phylogenetic relationships of any clusters. In fact, more extensive
analysis of these relationships (through our pipeline) can facilitate
the understanding of the diffusion of ideas and information across
the Web, and provide a rigorous technique for large-scale analysis
of Internet culture.
4.1.3 Meme Visualization. We also use the custom distance metric
(see Eq. 1) to visualize the clusters with annotations. We build a
graph G = (V , E), where V are the medoids of annotated clusters
and E the connections between medoids with distance under a
threshold κ. Fig. 6 shows a snapshot of the graph for κ = 0.45,
In Table 4, we report the top 20 memes for each Web community
sorted by the number of posts. We observe that Pepe the Frog [40]
and its variants are among the most popular memes for every plat-
form. While this might be an artifact of using fringe communities as
a “seed” for the clustering, recall that the goal of this work is in fact
to gain an understanding of how fringe communities disseminate
memes and influence mainstream ones. Thus, we leave to future
work a broader analysis of the wider meme ecosystem.
Sad Frog [31] is the most popular meme on /pol/ (4.9%), the 3rd on
Reddit (1.3%), the 10th on Gab (0.8%), and the 12th on Twitter (0.5%).
We also find variations like Smug Frog [47], Apu Apustaja [24],
Pepe the Frog [40], and Angry Pepe [23]. Considering that Pepe
is treated as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League [53]
and that is often used in hateful or racist, this likely indicates that
polarized communities like /pol/ and Gab do use memes to incite
hateful conversation. This is also evident from the popularity of the
anti-semitic Happy Merchant meme [32], which depicts a “greedy”
and “manipulative” stereotypical caricature of a Jew (3.8% on /pol/
and 1.1% on Gab).
By contrast, mainstream communities like Reddit and Twitter
primarily share harmless/neutral memes, which are rarely used in
hateful contexts. Specifically, on Reddit the top memes are Manning
Face [37] (2.2%) and That’s the Joke [48] (1.3%), while on Twitter
the top ones are Roll Safe [45] (5.9%) and Evil Kermit [30] (5.4%).
Once again, we find that users (in all communities) post memes
to share politics-related information, possibly aiming to enhance
or penalize the public image of politicians (see Appendix E of the
paper’s extended version [73] for an example of such memes). For
instance, we find Make America Great Again [36], a meme dedicated
