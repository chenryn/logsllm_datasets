User: How do you diagnose and resolve network failures under high load?
Assistant: 1. Analyze bandwidth utilization: Use network monitoring tools to check network bandwidth utilization. High bandwidth utilization may cause problems such as network delay and packet loss, which can be solved by increasing bandwidth or adjusting bandwidth allocation. 2. Check the network topology: a reasonable arrangement of the network topology can reduce network congestion and failures. Are there single points of failure, loops, congestion or bloat. 3. Check the configuration of routers and switches: check whether there are security incidents caused by attacks, such as DDoS attacks, etc., to see if security measures need to be strengthened, and useless ports are banned. 4. Check the health status of network devices: Check hardware (memory, cpu, fan, etc) and software (firmware, driver, update, etc) problems, such as fan failure, insufficient memory, firmware upgrade problems, etc. 5. Optimizing network settings: Using efficient protocols, optimizing cache, network QoS, etc. can improve network performance and efficiency, and can also solve problems such as network congestion. 6. Replace equipment: When all solutions fail to improve network performance problems, equipment and components may need to be replaced to improve network reliability and performance.
