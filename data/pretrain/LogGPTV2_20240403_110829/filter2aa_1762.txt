Our entire defense strategy is reactive, which often leads to failure. Here are some key issues:

- **Fixes Known Issues**: We only address known vulnerabilities.
- **Already Compromised**: The system may already be breached.
- **In Production**: Vulnerabilities are often discovered after the product is in use.
- **Patch Management**: Reduces vulnerabilities but is expensive and not always effective.
- **Secure Development**: Introduces new vulnerabilities and can create a false sense of security (security theater).

### What is Missing?
If these methods aren't working, we need to fight back.

### Attackers Are Human Too
Attackers have:
- **Finite Time**
- **Imperfect Tools**
- **Emotions, Ego, Bias**
- **Risk**

Target their weaknesses.

### Ambiguity
- **Server Banners**
- **File Extensions**
- **Default Files**

Why leave these up? Remove unnecessary information.

### Deception
**"Convince the enemy we are going to do something other than what we are really going to do."**

- **Lie about the rest**: Reduce what they can know.
- **Blatantly lying**: Increase the noise by adding misleading information.

### Tempo
- **Awareness and Action**: Act sooner rather than react.
- **Perceived vs. Actual Attack Surface**: Create a misleading attack surface.

### Mistrust
- **Shutting Down Tools**: Increase awareness and reduce the attack surface.
- **So Far, We've Shown**: Can we break it?

### Recap
- **Stop Acting Like This**: Reactive and vulnerable.
- **Start Acting Like This**: Proactive and deceptive.

### Capture the Flag
**The winner takes all.**

By adopting a proactive and deceptive approach, we can better protect our systems and outmaneuver potential attackers.
