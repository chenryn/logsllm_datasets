    import seaborn as sns
    import pandas as pd
    train_X = pd.read_csv("./train/X_train.txt", delim_whitespace=True, header=None)
    train_y = pd.read_csv("./train/y_train.txt", delim_whitespace=True, header=None)
    with open('./features.txt') as file: 
        header = []
        for line in file:
            header.append(line.strip().split()[1])
    train_X.columns = header
    train_X['labels'] = train_y
    train_X['labels'] = train_X['labels'].astype('category')
    sns.set_style("whitegrid")
then this fails with a `cannot label index with a null key` message from
pandas
    ax = sns.boxplot(x="labels", y="tBodyAcc-mean()-X", data=train_X)
while this works
    ax = sns.boxplot(x=train_X["labels"], y=train_X["tBodyAcc-mean()-X"])
The failing code is the same as the one written in the documentation and if I
load the "tips" dataset everything works exactly the same as in the
documentation. But I can not for the life of me see what the difference is
between my DataFrame and "tips" loaded from seaborn.
