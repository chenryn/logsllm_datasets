  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
  * Data urls should be left unmodified
## Current Behavior
  * `filter: url('data:image/svg+xml;...` gets mangled into `filter: url("http://localhost:3000//'data:image/svg+xml;...`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Clone https://github.com/agurtovoy/nextjs-css-substitution-bug
  2. `npm install`
  3. `npm dev`
  4. Open http://localhost:3000/ in Firefox, go to dev console's Style Editor tab, select "Show original sources" option to see the compiled CSS:

## Context
Note that **the issue has more severe impact in production** : a side-effect
of this bug is that the browser ignores the rest of the CSS line in question
due to unmatched `"`; because in production the CSS is likely to be minimized
into a single line of text, that means that all styles following the `filter:
drop-shadow` property will be silently ignored.
You can see that effect in the repo with the reproduce: if you do `npm build
&& npm start`, you'll see that the "Hello" text loses its red styling.
