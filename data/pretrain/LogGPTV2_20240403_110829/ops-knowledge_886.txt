Question: You are reviewing a piece of code that processes user input for a web application. The application needs to handle a variety of text inputs, including some with special characters. You're tasked with implementing strategies to prevent encoding errors that could lead to security vulnerabilities. Which of the following strategies would be effective in mitigating potential encoding errors? (Select two)
"A": "Allow only a list of predefined acceptable inputs that match business rule logic, rejecting or transforming any input that does not conform.",
"B": "Use dynamic query strings that combine control and data, ensuring the use of special characters is limited to alphanumeric and whitespace.",
"C": "Decode and canonicalize inputs to a consistent internal representation before validation, avoiding double-decoding to prevent bypassing validation.",
"D": "Implement a denylist of malicious inputs and rely on it as the primary method of input validation to ensure security."
Answer: AC
