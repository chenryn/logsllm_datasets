Scrapy docs recommends using PEP8 coding convention when writing code for
inclusion in Scrapy, with the exception of 79 character line length rule . A
quick run of `pep8` utility shows me that there are several occurrence of PEP8
violation in the master branch. If given the nod from the maintainers, I would
like to work on resolving this.
