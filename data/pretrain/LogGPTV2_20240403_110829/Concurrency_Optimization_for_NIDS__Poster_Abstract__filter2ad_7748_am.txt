**Abstract:**
The integration of liquid chromatography with drift tube ion mobility and mass spectrometry (LC-DTIM-MS) enhances the characterization and identification of lipid species by providing an additional dimension for separating structural isomers. This is particularly beneficial for the analysis of oxylipins, which are challenging to detect due to their low physiological abundance and narrow mass range. To address these challenges, we developed a combined analytical-computational method for the identification of oxylipins and their precursor fatty acids.

In this study, we focus on the computational aspects of our workflow. Accurate mass, collision cross-section values in nitrogen (DTCCSN2), and retention times were obtained for 47 oxylipin and fatty acid standards through triplicate acquisitions using a reversed-phase LC-DTIM-MS workflow. These data were compiled into an internal library, which was then used to identify these compounds in biological samples. Our method not only directly identifies oxylipins and fatty acids but also flags similar species, reducing the number of annotations from external databases and guiding further characterization and discovery of potentially novel species.

We applied this method to several datasets, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-infected murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages and thrombin-activated human platelets. The results were consistent with the literature and improved the identification of features that would otherwise be annotated with a vast number of compounds.

**Abstract:**
Over a decade ago, the New Nordic Diet (NND) was designed by chefs and scientists, emphasizing sustainable, local, and nutritious foods, primarily consisting of vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, fish, shellfish, and game meat. The NND has been shown to benefit overweight individuals by reducing body weight, lowering blood pressure, and improving blood lipids.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the NND on the human urine metabolome and compared it with the Average Danish Diet (ADD). Urine samples from 142 centrally obese Danes were collected at baseline, after 6 months, and 12 months of intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to either the NND or ADD. Untargeted 1H-NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze the urine samples, and the acquired spectra were converted into a metabolite table using the Signature Mapping (SigMa) approach.

Multivariate data analysis methods were employed to examine the effects of diet, season, gender, and body weight change. NND samples showed higher concentrations of glycine, betaine, glucose, TMAO, and creatinine, while ADD samples had greater levels of tartrate, dimethyl sulfone, and propylene glycol. Propylene glycol was also associated with the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA) in the NND group. These findings support previous research on the NND, indicating different effects on protein and carbohydrate metabolism, and provide insights into its impact on human health and gut microbiota.

**Abstract:**
Cadmium (Cd) exposure, whether occupational or through cigarette smoking, can cause adverse health effects. Low-level environmental Cd exposure, primarily from food, is a global health concern due to its long biological half-life (10-30 years) in humans and animals. While high-dose Cd toxicity is well-documented, the effects of low-level dietary Cd exposure have only recently been characterized.

Our previous study demonstrated that lung Cd burden in non-smokers caused changes in the mouse lung metabolome, affecting airway reactivity, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and profibrotic signaling. We also observed potentiated adverse reactions to H1N1 influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as worsened microbiome disruption by a high-fructose diet.

In the current study, we examined the effects of Cd on the lung mitochondrial metabolome using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry-based high-resolution metabolomics (HRM). Mitochondria isolated from lungs were analyzed for metabolome and metabolic pathway alterations, and metal concentrations were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The results showed that Cd caused significant changes in mitochondrial metabolites, including fatty acids, carnitines, and CoA, disrupting fatty acid oxidation and energy metabolism. These findings suggest that dietary Cd accumulation could pose a potential pulmonary health risk by disrupting mitochondrial function, specifically in fatty acid and energy metabolism, and enhancing inflammation through mitochondrial H2O2 signaling.

**P-3: Integration of Proteomics and Metabolomics Data to Stratify Severe Septic Shock Patients**

**Abstract:**
In this study, we examined the plasma metabolome and proteome in patients with severe septic shock enrolled in the multicenter ALBIOS study (Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis study, NCT007071225). The objective was to identify changes in metabolites involved in septic shock progression and integrate this information with protein variations. Targeted metabolomics and untargeted proteomics were used to quantify absolute metabolite concentrations and relative protein abundances. The fold change D7/D1 was computed to account for variations from day 1 (D1) to day 7 (D7) after shock diagnosis.

Patients were divided into two groups based on 28-day mortality. Two elastic net logistic regression models were built: one using only metabolites and another combining metabolites and proteins. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis were also implemented, and a filter strategy was used to reduce the number of features. All models correctly classified the observations in the testing set.

Our findings confirmed that non-survivors have different trends in plasma lipid levels compared to survivors, aligning with previous studies. The key proteins in stratifying patients were those related to the inflammatory response and coagulation cascade, confirming the feasibility and robustness of our integrative approach. Combining metabolomics and proteomics data highlighted key features associated with patient outcomes.

**P-4: New Insights in Metabolomics-Based Study of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Lipoprotein Profile and Patient Follow-Up**

**Abstract:**
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in people aged 50 and older. Late-stage AMD, known as exudative AMD, is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and results in severe visual impairment and legal blindness. Current AMD diagnosis relies on ophthalmologic exams, and treatments for exudative AMD use anti-angiogenic drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF).

Despite these advances, identifying therapeutic treatments and related biomarkers remains essential. In this study, we applied an NMR-based metabolomics approach to a cohort of AMD patients and a laser-induced murine CNV experimental model that mimics the pathology's angiogenesis phase. Sera from controls and AMD patients (in active and non-active phases) and from induced and non-induced mice were collected and subjected to a metabolomics study using a multivariate approach.

This approach allowed differentiation between active and non-active AMD patients and between laser-induced and control mice. The discriminating spectral zones were consistent in both human and mouse models, leading to the identification of putative biomarkers for exudative AMD. Among these, the lipoprotein profile is particularly interesting, as some studies have highlighted the roles of HDL cholesterol and oxidized LDL in early and para-inflammatory AMD stages. Our preliminary studies show similar lipoprotein profile evolution across different human and mouse groups, suggesting that investigating the lipoprotein profile could provide insights into the pathologic processes occurring during the development of CNV.

**P-5: Confirming the Key Role of Glutathione in the Mechanism of Drug Resistance to Artemisinin-Based Antimalarials**

**Abstract:**
Artemisinin and its analogues, in combination with partner drugs, are the mainstay of malaria treatment. However, emerging resistance of Plasmodium falciparum parasites to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) reduces clinical effectiveness and threatens global malaria control efforts. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of resistance is crucial.

It has been shown that slow parasite clearance following artemisinin treatment is associated with mutations in the PfKelch13 gene. Metabolomics analysis of PfKelch13-mutant parasites revealed increased levels of glutathione (GSH) and gamma-glutamyl cysteine compared to artemisinin-sensitive lines. GSH plays a pivotal role in anti-oxidative defense and other cellular processes within the parasite.

In this study, we investigated the role of GSH in PfKelch13-mediated artemisinin resistance by inhibiting GSH biosynthesis pathways. Resistant parasites were pre-incubated with buthionine sulphoximine (a gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor) and sulfasalazine (a cysteine transport inhibitor), which restored sensitivity to artemisinin to levels comparable to sensitive lines (40% survival decreased to 18%, p < 0.05). These results confirm the key role of GSH in artemisinin resistance and highlight the potential of targeting GSH biosynthesis to combat drug-resistant malaria.

**Abstract:**
Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in the elderly and can lead to serious health issues. Elevated serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels are a reliable marker for B12 deficiency. In this study, we developed and validated a UPLC-MS/MS method for the multiplex urine analysis of MMA and creatinine in a cohort of 112 elderly participants (aged >70 years) from the NuAge cohort, with serum MMA levels ranging from 165 to 15285 nmol/L.

The method involves mixing 30 µL of urine with 60 µL of water containing MMA-D3 and creatinine-D3 as internal standards. A 2-minute reverse-phase chromatographic method was used to separate MMA from succinic acid, a major isomeric interference. The Acquity I-Class UPLC system (Waters Inc.) and Xevo TQ-S Micro tandem mass spectrometer (Waters) were employed for the analysis.

Our results show a significant correlation between urinary MMA/creatinine ratios and serum MMA levels (Spearman r = 0.59). This UPLC-MS/MS method for measuring urinary MMA is promising for diagnosing B12 deficiency and could be applicable as a second-tier test for newborn urine screening.
