Improved oxylipins and fatty acids identification by using LC-DTIM-MS
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sonia Liggi, Department of Biochemistry and Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Christine Hinz, John Fjeldsted, Julian L. Griffin
The use of liquid chromatography coupled with drift tube ion mobility and mass spectrometry (LC-DTIM-MS) can help the characterization and identification 
of lipid species, reflecting the additional dimension provided by ion mobility which can improve separation of the numerous structural isomers in these 
molecular classes Nonetheless, the analysis of oxylipins is particularly challenging given their physiological low abundance in biological samples and 
the narrow mass range occupied by this lipid category To overcome these limitations, we developed a combined analytical-computational method for 
the analysis and identification of oxylipins and their precursor fatty acids Herein, we focus on presenting the computational part of the workflow More 
specifically, accurate mass, collision-cross section values in nitrogen (DTCCSN2) and retention times of 47 oxylipins and fatty acids standards were 
obtained after triplicate acquisition on a reversed-phase LC-DTIM-MS workflow, and integrated in an internal library subsequently used for the identification 
of these compounds in biological samples Aside from directly identifying oxylipins and fatty acids, we were also able to flag species as similar to those in 
the internal library These flags not only reduce the number of annotations from external databases, providing a lead for further characterization analyses, 
but also guide discovery studies of potentially novel species The method was applied to several datasets of biological samples, such as Salmonella 
enterica serovar Typhimurium infected murine bone-marrow derived macrophages and thrombin activated human platelets, providing results in agreement 
with the literature and improving the identification of features otherwise annotated with a vast number of compounds

The impact of the Healthy New Nordic diet on the human urine metabolome as measured by 1H-NMR spectroscopy
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alessia Trimigno, University of Copenhagen, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Bekzod Khakimov, Søren Balling Engelsen
More than a decade ago, chefs and scientists designed the New Nordic diet (NND) This diet was based on sustainable, local and nutritious foods It 
mainly consisted in vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, fish, shellfish and game meat NND was proved beneficial on overweight people, ie decreasing 
body weight, reducing glycaemia, lowering blood pressure, and improving blood lipids In this study, we investigated how the healthy NND affects 
the human urine metabolome and compared it with the effect of the Average Danish Diet (ADD) Urine samples from 142 centrally obese Danes 
were collected at baseline, after 6 months and 12 months of intervention Subjects were randomly assigned to ADD or NND Urine samples were 
analyzed through untargeted 1H-NMR spectroscopy and the acquired spectra were converted into a metabolite table using the novel Signature 
Mapping (SigMa) approach The urine metabolite table was scrutinized using multivariate data analysis methods to reveal the impact of the different 
study design factors including diet, season, gender, and bodyweight change NND samples revealed higher concentrations of glycine, betaine, 
glucose, TMAO and creatinine, whilst ADD urine had greater levels of tartrate, dimethyl sulfone and propylene glycol The latter was also found to 
be associated in the NND group with the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA) Results from this study corroborate previous 
information on the NND, indicating different effects on the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and help in better understanding its actual 
impact on human health (eg glycaemia, inflammation) and on the gut microbiota metabolism

Cadmium (Cd) causes adverse health effects from occupational exposures and cigarette smoking  Lower level of environmental Cd exposure, 
principally from food, is a global health concern because of the long biological half-life of Cd (10-30 years) in humans and animals Despite Cd 
toxicity at high dose exposures being well documented, the impacts of Cd exposures at low levels through dietary intake has only recently been 
characterized Our previous study showed that lung Cd burden found in non-smoker’s lung caused changes in the mouse lung metabolome with 
effects on airway reactivity, glycolysis and lipid metabolism, inflammation and profibrotic signaling Our data further showed potentiated adverse 
reaction to H1N1 influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus and worsened microbiome disruption by high-fructose diet In the current study, we 
examined the effects of Cd on lung mitochondrial metabolome using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry-based high-resolution metabolomics 
(HRM) Mitochondria (250 mg) isolated from lungs were analyzed for metabolome and metabolic pathway by HRM, and concentrations of Cd and 
other metals by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry The results showed that Cd caused alterations in large numbers of mitochondrial 
metabolites including fatty acids, carnitines and CoA, and disrupted fatty acid oxidation and energy metabolism The results suggest that Cd 
accumulation by dietary exposure could be a potential pulmonary health risk involving disruption of mitochondria as a central mechanism in lung, 
specifically in fatty acid and energy metabolism and enhanced inflammation by mitochondrial H2O2 signaling

Integration of proteomics and metabolomics data to stratify severe septic shock patients
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Manuela Ferrario, Politecnico di Milano, Italy
CO-AUTHORS: Alice Cambiaghi, Eliandre de Olivera, Laura Brunelli, Roberta Pastorelli
In this work, we examined plasma metabolome and proteome in patients with severe septic shock enrolled in the multicenter ALBIOS study 
(Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis study, NCT007071225) The objective was to identify changes in the levels of metabolites involved in septic 
shock progression and to integrate this information with the variation occurring in proteins Mass spectrometry based targeted metabolomics and 
untargeted proteomics allowed us to quantify absolute metabolites concentration and relative proteins abundance We computed the fold change 
D7/D1 to take into account their variation from day 1 (D1) to day 7 (D7) after shock diagnosis Patients were divided into two groups according to 28-
day mortality Two different elastic net logistic regression models were built: one on metabolites only and one on metabolites and proteins Linear 
Discriminant Analysis and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis were also implemented A filter strategy was adopted to reduce the number 
of features All the obtained models correctly classified the observations in the testing set Our findings confirmed that non-survivors have different 
trend in plasma levels of lipid species in comparison to survivors, in line with previous works Our approach showed that the proteins decisive in 
stratifying the patients are those related to the inflammatory response and the coagulation cascade, which are known to play an important role in 
septic shock progression, thus confirming the feasibility and robustness of our integrative approach Integrating metabolomics data with proteomics 
one enabled to highlight key features associated with the outcome

New insight in Metabolomics based study of Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Lipoprotein profile and  
patients follow-up

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is common disease and leading causes of vision loss among people aged 50 and older Late-stage AMD 
(called exudative) is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and results in complete loss of central vision acuity leading to severe 
visual impairment and legal blindness Currently, AMD diagnosis relies on ophthalmologic exams and treatments of the exudative form using anti-
angiogenic drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) Despite these advances, the identification of therapeutic treatments and 
related biomarkers are essentials In this study, we applied a NMR-based metabolomics approach on a cohort of AMD patients and on a laser-
induced murine CNV experimental model that mimics the pathology angiogenesis’s development phase Sera from controls and AMD patients (in 
active and non-active pathology’s phases) and from induced and non-induced mice have been collected and submitted to a metabolomics study, 
using a multivariate approach This approach allows differentiation between active and non-active AMD patients and between laser-induced and 
the control mice groups Moreover, the discriminating spectral zones are the same in both human and mice’s models, leading to the emergence 
of putative biomarkers of the exudative AMD Among those, lipoprotein profile is interesting while some studies highlighted HDL cholesterol 
and oxidized LDL with early and para-inflammatory AMD stages Our primary studies show similar evolution in lipoprotein profile through the 
different human and mice’ groups These data suggest that investigate lipoprotein profile could be the turning point in the pathologic process’s 
comprehension occurring during the apparition and/or the development of pathologic CNV process

Confirming the key role of glutathione in the mechanism of drug resistance to artemisinin-based antimalarials
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dovile Anderson, Monash University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Ghizal Siddiqui, Amanda De Paoli, Darren J. Creek
Malaria treatment is reliant on artemisinin and its analogues in combination with partner drugs Emerging resistance of Plasmodium falciparum 
parasites to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) reduces clinical effectiveness and threatens global malaria control efforts Therefore 
investigations of the mechanisms of resistance are urgently required It has been shown that slow parasite clearance following artemisinin treatment 
is associated with mutations in the PfKelch13 gene Metabolomics analysis of these PfKelch13-mutant parasites has revealed increased levels of 
glutathione (GSH) and gamma-glutamyl cysteine compared to the artemisinin-sensitive line GSH is known to play a pivotal role in anti-oxidative 
defence and other cellular processes within the parasite In this study, the role of GSH in PfKelch13-mediated artemisinin resistance was investigated 
by inhibiting GSH biosynthesis pathways Inhibition of GSH biosynthesis was achieved by pre-incubating resistant parasites with buthionine 
sulphoximine (a gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor) and sulfasalazine (a cysteine transport inhibitor), which restored sensitivity towards 
artemisinin to levels comparable to sensitive lines (40% survival decreased to 18%, p 70 years) from the NuAge cohort 
with serum MMA levels varying from 165 to 15285 nmol/L A reliable UPLC-MS/MS method for the multiplex urine analysis of MMA and creatinine 
was developed and validated Briefly, 30 µL of urine was mixed with 60 µL of water containing MMA-D3 and creatinine-D3 as internal standards 
A 2-minute reverse phase chromatographic method allowed the separation of MMA from succinic acid, a major isomeric interference The Acquity 
I-Class UPLC system (Waters Inc) was used The absolute quantitation of MMA and creatinine was achieved by tandem mass spectrometry (Xevo 
TQ-S Micro, Waters) using the multiple reaction monitoring mode Our results show a significant correlation between urinary MMA/creatinine ratios 
and MMA serum levels (Spearman r=059) Urine MMA measured by this UPLC-MS/MS method is promising for diagnosing B12 deficiency This 
method could also be applicable as a 2nd tier-test for MMA newborn urine screening
