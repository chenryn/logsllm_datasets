User: Please provide a scenario that can be used to monitor server load and adjust accordingly.
Assistant: common solution is to use a load balancer, which distributes traffic across multiple servers, thereby relieving the pressure on a single server. The following is a more detailed solution example: 1. Use a load balancer (such as Nginx or HAProxy) to distribute traffic to multiple servers to ensure that the load of each server is relatively balanced. 2. Configure monitoring tools (such as Zabbix or Prometheus) to monitor the CPU, memory, and disk usage of the server, and set alarm rules. 3. Use automated operation and maintenance tools (such as Ansible or Puppet) to automatically deploy, upgrade, and configure servers to improve efficiency and consistency. 4. For application performance bottlenecks, use performance monitoring tools (such as New Relic or AppDynamics) to analyze and optimize code, database queries, etc. 5. Dynamically adjust the number of servers according to the server load. You can use the auto-scaling function of cloud service providers (such as AWS or Alibaba Cloud) to automatically increase or decrease servers according to the load. Through the above solutions and implementation steps, you can effectively monitor the server load and make corresponding adjustments.
