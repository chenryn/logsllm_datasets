Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-add-your-javascript-
slot-machine-slots has an issue.
I am allowed to continue to the next challenge with the single condition still
in a state of failure. I can skip along without adding a return statement or
modifying the existing return statement.
Additionally, the state of the condition appears to randomly alternate between
pass/fail without actually having changed the code in any way (see attached
screenshots). I couldn't reproduce the behaviour with a specific set of steps,
but moving the caret around would eventually cause it (doesn't take long) as
would highlighting different text selections (seems to be only when a line
feed is included in the selection).
~~Finally, it seems like we are short-circuiting our function here by adding
the return statement in the specified area in the code. All of the code
below`// Only change code above this line.` never executes and includes a
redundant return statement that would have returned a completely different
data type. This may be irrelevant to the intent of the exercise, but it feels
like it could be confusing.~~
After moving to the next challenge, I see that I had missed the point entirely
and I should have copied the conditional verbatim from the description into
our code. I guess I was freestyling. I was confused by the statement `If all
three numbers match, we should change the value of win to the number that we
have three of or leave it as null.` in the description and thought I was to
add a variable called `win` and set it to either `null` or the winning number.
Sorry for wasting anyones time reading through that. The first two paragraphs
may still be relevant, though.
I'm fairly new at this so please tell me if protocol decrees that I should
have broken this report up into separate reports.
