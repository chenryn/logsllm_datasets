**ATT&CK ID:** S0408  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** FlexiSpy

**Description:**
FlexiSpy leverages root access to establish reboot hooks, enabling the application to reinstall itself from the `/data/misc/adn` directory upon system startup.[8] During the boot process, FlexiSpy initiates several daemons responsible for process monitoring, call monitoring, call management, and system-level operations.[8]

This ensures that the malware remains persistent and can continue its malicious activities even after a system reboot.
