which will be described in the next two sections.
B. Quantitative data collection and analysis
To answer our ﬁrst two research questions and to test the
corresponding hypotheses, we used the following measures. A
full overview of all used scales can be found in Appendix B.
Usability (SUS). We measured usability (α = .80) with the
10-item System Usability Scale (short SUS) from Brooke [42].
Participants stated their level of agreement or disagreement for
the 10 items based on their experience with the authentication
method. The resulting scores are between 0 and 100 whereby
higher scores indicate a higher/better usability.
Acceptance. Acceptance (α = .90) was measured with the
scale from van der Laan et al. [47]. This scale measures
acceptance with 9 semantic differentials. The resulting scores
are between 1 and 5 whereby higher scores indicate a high-
er/greater acceptance.
Afﬁnity for Technology Interaction (ATI). We measured
Afﬁnity for Technology Interaction (α = .92) using the scale
from Franke et al. [50], which measures the construct on a
9-item scale. The resulting scores are between 1 and 6 where
higher scores indicate a higher/greater afﬁnity.
Privacy Concern (PC). The participants’ privacy concern
(α = .82) was measured by a 4-item scale taken from Langer
et al. [57]. The resulting scores are between 1 and 7 whereby
higher scores indicate higher/more privacy concerns.
Demographic Questions. To gain further insight into our
study sample, participants answered questions regarding their

age, gender, highest educational degree, computer science
background, and ﬁeld of study/work.
C. Qualitative data collection and analysis
While standardized measuring instruments allow a compar-
ison between our two authentication methods, they are limited
in their ability to fully capture individual perception, thoughts,
and concerns of users. Therefore, we collected additional
qualitative data to answer our third research question.
Our participants answered open-ended text questions about
their general impression of the authentication methods, the
advantages and disadvantages they see, as well as their willing-
ness to use the method in their personal lives. Our open-ended
questions about general impressions were inspired by closest
related work [40] and adapted to our speciﬁc study setting
using best-practices from commercial user experience test-
ing [58] and literature [59] (e.g., recommendations for question
form and wording). The open-ended questions about the ad-
vantages and disadvantages were added to gain further insights
into encouraging and hindering factors in the adaptation of the
authentication methods. Additionally, it was of interest to us
to ﬁnd out more about reasons for (un-)willingness to use
the authentication methods. The questions were successfully
evaluated in a pilot study with ﬁve participants, which did
not mention any issues. The corresponding questions can be
found in Appendix B. Subsequently, we used inductive coding
(see [59], [60], [61], [62]) to analyze their answers.
In a ﬁrst step, three researchers independently read all open-
ended text answers of our participants and marked all state-
ments that might contain information related to our general
research questions. The results were discussed and an initial
coding scheme was developed. In the next step, the initial
categories were merged by axial coding to category clusters
and topics. After this step had been carried out independently
by three researchers,
they merged their category systems,
discussed inconsistencies and created the ﬁnal code book.
Based on this code book, all answers were coded again by two
independent researchers. The coders achieved a good mean
inter-rater reliability (correspondence between the coders) of
Krippendorff’s Alpha = .817 [63]. A complete overview of the
coding system can be found in Table VI in Appendix C.

Participant recruiting took place via social media groups as
well as in lectures and with ﬂyers on our campus.
A. Sample and participant demographics
Our ﬁnal sample included N = 94 participants, 56.4%
(n = 53) of whom identiﬁed themselves as female and the
mean age was 24.91. The participants’ educational background
met the expectations of a university sample. Table II presents
descriptive data for both groups. The second to last column
indicates whether there were signiﬁcant differences between
the groups. We found differences for our dependent variables
as well as for some control variables which we will discuss in
more detail in our statistical analysis. In general, there were
no differences in the demographic composition of the groups.
D. Ethical concerns
B. Quantitative results
The study design and protocol were reviewed and approved
by the ethical review board of our university. We did not col-
lect any personal information, such as username and password.
We temporarily stored participants’ email address to reimburse
them with an Amazon voucher ($12 for ≈45 minutes of partic-
ipation) and deleted the email addresses after that. All server-
side software (i.e., a Limesurvey Community Edition software)
was self-hosted on a maintained and hardened university server
to which only researchers involved in this study have access.
VI. RESULTS
Our data were collected from mid-December 2018 to end-
February 2019 in a laboratory on the campus of our university.
Usability: Regarding H1, an unpaired two-sample t-tests
showed signiﬁcant higher SUS scores in Group1FA (M = 81.74)
than in GroupPass (M = 71.77); t(92) = 4.116, p < .001, Cohen’s
d = .85 These results provide support for our hypothesis:
FIDO2 passwordless authentication is perceived as more
usable than traditional password-based authentication.
However, when comparing the SUS scores in our study with
other systems and the descriptions provided by Bangor et
al. [64] and Sauro et al. [65], both authentication methods
are evaluated positively (as "Good", receiving a B grade).
Acceptance: With respect to H2 an unpaired two-sample
t-tests showed signiﬁcant higher acceptance scores in Group-
1FA (M = 4.29) than in GroupPass (M = 3.41); t(92) = 6.522,

p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.35. In other words: Passwordless
authentication with the Yubico Security Key was more
accepted by our participants than traditional password-
based authentication.
In a next step we assessed the acceptance of the authen-
tication methods with a regression analysis to include the
potential effects of the control variables. Stepwise we built
regression models including: 1) the control variables, 2) SUS,
3) authentication type (GroupPass is the base line against which
Group1FA is compared) and 4) all possible interactions between
all those variables. We used robust regression techniques [66]
to calculate the standard error for all estimates in our mod-
els, as the Breusch-Pagan test [67] indicated a violation of
homoscedasticity (χ2 = 11.949, df = 5, p-value < .05) for our
models. Before the analysis, all metric predictor variables were
grand-mean centered to facilitate the interpretation later on.
Considering the complexity of the models, Model 3 contain-
ing the ﬁrst three types of predictor variables mentioned above
could explain our empirical data best (see Appendix D for
model comparison). This model explained 48.8% (R2 = .488)
of the total variance in users’ acceptance scores. Table III
gives an overview of the predictors in this model. Our results
showed that the SUS score (b = .02, p < .001), an individual’s
computer science background (b = -.33, p = .025), and the
predictor representing the difference between the two groups
had a signiﬁcant effect on the acceptance of the authentication
methods by the users (b = .76, p < .001).
Neither ATI nor Privacy Concerns showed a signiﬁcant
effect on the acceptance of the authentication method. A post-
hoc relative importance analysis showed that the predictor
representing the group differences accounted for the majority
(51.5%) of the explained variance while SUS accounted for
another 42.8%. Although computer science background is
a signiﬁcant predictor of acceptance, its contribution to the
explained variance is very limited (3.7%). The remaining 2.0%
can be statistically attributed to the non-signiﬁcant factors
ATI and Privacy Concerns. Overall,
these results suggest
that: (a) The more usable users perceive an authentication
method, the more they will accept that speciﬁc authentication
method; (b) Even when the control variables are taken into
account,
the FIDO2 1FA authentication method is widely
more accepted than the traditional password-based method;
(c) Moreover, we found that people with a computer science
background showed in general lower acceptance scores than
people without such a background,
independently of the
authentication method. This is in contrast to recent results
about usability of biometrics [68], where experts more readily
adopted new technology than non-experts. However, our post-
hoc relative weight analysis showed that this effect is minimal
and negligible compared to other signiﬁcant predictors.
C. Qualitative Results
Qualitative analysis of the free text responses revealed ﬁve
major concepts for perception, acceptance, and possible use.
a) Shift from cognitive to physical effort: The vast
majority (74; 79% both groups) of our study participants

mentioned in one way or another the effort associated with
the usage of the speciﬁc authentication methods, but in both
groups different forms of effort were mentioned. For tradi-
tional passwords, primarily the cognitive efforts associated
with the use were described. Participants found the creation of
secure and unique passwords (5; 10% GroupPass) but also their
memorization (16; 33% GroupPass) a difﬁcult and demanding
task. According to them, the ever-increasing number of ac-
counts that users have to manage are a very burdening factor,
as users frequently forget their passwords, resulting in losing
access to their accounts. Regarding passwordless authentica-
tion, cognitive effort was not an issue for our participants. In
fact, the reduction of cognitive effort compared to password-
based authentication was seen as a great (if not the greatest)
advantage of passwordless technology (44; 96% Group1FA).
"No recalling of the password. For [a] new account,
one need not [to] worry to come up with a password
and remember it for later use."(P92, Group1FA)
In addition to mental efforts of an authentication method,
our participants also described physical efforts associated
with these methods. Corresponding topics were particularly
evident for passwordless authentication. Eighteen (39%) of the
participants in Group1FA criticized that this method requires
carrying a device to be able to authenticate. It was seen as
problematic and annoying that it is not possible to use web
services if the security key is not present, which restricts
spontaneous and ad hoc use.
"I think the only problem with this kind of authenti-
cation system is that the user[s] have to carry their
Yubikey [Yubico Security Key] everywhere with them
[...]" (P62, Group1FA)
This physical effort was perceived as one of the major
disadvantages of passwordless authentication and led to further
concerns which we will discuss later. In contrast to pass-
wordless authentication, only a few of our participants saw
a physical effort in classical password-based authentication.
Solely the fact that typing passwords can be annoying was
mentioned (5; 10% GroupPass) as a disadvantage in this area.
Comparing both authentication methods, the switch from
password-based to passwordless authentication was associated
with a clear shift in the participants’ perception from cognitive

275
to physical effort. This reﬂects the paradigm shift underlying
the switch to FIDO2 1FA—away from ‘something I know’,
over to ‘something I have.’
b) Changes in threat model: Participants from both
groups thought about factors and problems that could affect
the security of their accounts (59; 63% both groups), although
the prevailing threat models differed greatly. In GroupPass
participants (25; 51%) were primarily worried that weak
passwords, password reuse, or phishing attacks could lead to
an attacker gaining access to their accounts and abusing them.
The participants of Group1FA (28; 61%) were mainly afraid
that someone else could gain access to their accounts with a
lost or stolen security key. They were particularly worried as
they considered their accounts to be completely unprotected as
soon as their key fell into the wrong hands (8; 17% Group1FA).
“I just have one concern: What if someone steal[s]
my Yubikey [Yubico Security Key]? Does that mean
he can access all my accounts just inserting it [to]
his computer?” (P66, Group1FA)
For this reason, some of our participants wanted an addi-
tional layer of protection, such as biometrics, to protect the
security key against unauthorized use.
"[...] I would prefer a ﬁnger print veriﬁcation rather
than a push of a button because it is unique only for
me." (P91, Group1FA)
Moreover, our participants (11; 24% Group1FA) were wor-
ried about a point that was no issue in GroupPass: The loss of
control over one’s own account and thus one’s own data if the
security key is lost, stolen, forgotten, or damaged.
“If I forget the YubiKey [Yubico Security Key], I
can’t get into my accounts.” (P63, Group1FA)
"If my Yubikey [Yubico Security Key] gets broken
(let’s say my coffee spilled on it) I won’t be able to
login to my accounts." (P54, Group1FA)
Thereby, several participants raised the question how to
"revoke" and "recover" account access in such a case. These
concerns went so far that they expressed a desire for a backup
authentication method.
“There should be a way to use your accounts without
