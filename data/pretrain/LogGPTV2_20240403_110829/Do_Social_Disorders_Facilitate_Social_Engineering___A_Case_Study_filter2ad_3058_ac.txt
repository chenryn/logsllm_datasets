calculated the accuracy and response times corresponding to the
detection of the legitimacy of only the familiar websites. We con-
sidered both real and fake versions of the websites deemed familiar
by the users. Table 4 summarizes our results. The overall accuracy
of correctly identifying a familiar website is around 77%, which is
better than random guessing (50%). We observe that the accuracy
of identifying the easy fake website is higher than other websites
from table 4, we did not find statistically significant difference in
mean accuracies and response time across real, fake, easy fake and
difficult fake websites on the Friedman’s test.

5.2 Participants with Autism
In this section, we analyze the accuracy and response time we
measured during our study for the participants with the autism.
The group of participants with autism serves as a target class for
our study.
5.2.1 Performance Analysis: All Websites. For this analysis, simi-
lar to the analysis of the control participants, we consider all the
websites (familiar and unfamiliar websites) presented in the experi-
ment. We then calculated the percentage accuracy and the response
times related to different types of websites. Table 5 summarizes our
results.

From Table 5, we see that the overall accuracy of phishing de-
tection is around 74%, which is better than random guessing (50%).
Also, we observe that the accuracy of identifying real websites is
more than the accuracy of identifying fake websites. However, we
did not find statistically significant differences among the mean
accuracies of real, fake, easy fake and difficult fake websites on
using Friedman’s test.
5.2.2 Performance Analysis: Familiar Websites. To enable website
familiarity analysis, we had asked participants, in the post-experiment
phase to answer if they had an account with the websites presented
in the study. In this analysis, we calculated the accuracy and re-
sponse times corresponding to the detection of the legitimacy of
only familiar websites. We considered both real and fake versions
of the websites deemed familiar by the users. Table 6 summarizes
our results. As seen in Table 6, the overall accuracy of phishing
detection for familiar websites was around 75%, which is only better
than a random guess. We assumed that the users might be better
at detecting the phishing attacks against the websites they were
familiar with. However, our results do not show much difference.
We did not observe statistically significant difference in mean
accuracies across Real, Fake, Easy Fake and Difficult Fake websites
on the Friedman’s test. However, the Friedman’s test showed a
statistically significant difference in mean response time across
2(3) = 13.8, p < .005). On further contrasting the response times
(χ
across different types of websites with WSRT, we found that the
participants spent statistically significantly higher time on real
websites than the fake websites (p<.005).

5.3 Performance Comparison: Participants
with Autism vs. Control Participants
To analyze the differences in the performance of the participants
with and without autism in phishing detection task, we performed
Mann-Whitney U Test. Mann-Whitney U Test is a non-parametric
test used to compare if two sample means from two different groups
of the same population are equal or not. In our analysis, on Mann-
Whitney U Test, we did not observe statistically significant differ-
ence in the mean accuracy of identifying phishing websites between
the participants with autism and without autism. This shows that
the participants with autism may not be more susceptible to phish-
ing attacks.
On further inspection, we found that the previous studies [4, 8]
have reported that the users with autism are methodical. Also,
Carper et al. [11], in their neuroscience study, reported that the
symmetry in the brains of users with autism might make them more
detail oriented. Also, cybersecurity practitioners have reported that
the people with autism have strengths including cognitive pattern
recognition, attention to detail, logical and methodical thinking,
focus and integrity which might help corporate and/or intelligence
sector [3, 6]. In light of these aspects, the participants with autism
might have been careful, and might have noticed the differences
in URL in making their decisions, and might have identified many
of the websites correctly. Indeed, in the post-test questionnaire
(see Section 6), the participants with autism reported that they
noticed differences in URL, and differences in logo on the websites
presented to them. Nevertheless, our study concludes that the users
with autism might not be more vulnerable to phishing attacks
compared to typical users without autism.
5.4 Correlation: Autism Quotient vs.
Accuracy and Response Time
We investigated how the autism scores drawn from AQ score cor-
relates to the accuracy and the response time of detecting the real,
fake, easy fake, and difficult fake websites. We used the Spearman’s
correlation coefficient to calculate the correlation of these metrics
in both categories of websites – all websites, and only the familiar
websites.. And we did not observe any statistically significant cor-
relation between the AQ score, and the accuracy and the response
time of the websites presented to the participants. This means that
the ability of detecting phishing website may be independent of
the autism condition of the participants.
6 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
To recall, after completing the phishing detection experimental task,
the colorblue both the participants with and without autism were
asked to fill out a post-test questionnaire. This questionnaire was
designed to determine participants’ knowledge of computer security
and privacy. We asked the participants about phishing, spam, and
the browser indicators. We had also asked them regarding their
strategy implemented to identify the phishing websites presented
to them during the phishing detection. Our post-test survey was
deliberately presented at the end of the actual experiment to prevent
any explicit priming due to our asking security-pertinent questions.
We summarize the responses of the participants to the questions
they were asked in the post-test questionnaires below:
473
ACSAC ’18, December 3–7, 2018, San Juan, PR, USA
A. Neupane et al.
• Concern of Security and Privacy on the Web: Since our study
was a security study, we started our post-test questionnaire
with basic security questions. One of these questions polled
for participants’ concern regarding the security and the pri-
vacy on the Internet. It might be correlated with the amount
of attention the users pay while identifying malicious web
activities and attack. 100% of our participants (both with and
without autism) reported that they were concerned about
their security and privacy on the web. Also, 100% of the
participants (both with and without autism) mentioned that
they were concerned about the leakage of the passwords
they use on the Internet websites.
• Web Browsing Behavior: To ensure that participants relate
themselves with the brands of the websites presented in our
study, we asked them how often they browse the Internet
and for what purposes. 100% of the participants (both with
and without autism) reported that they browse Internet daily
for making online purchases, online bill payments, reading
news articles, online banking and social networking. Most
of the phishing websites are targeted to the brands involved
in these domains. We also asked the participant familiarity
to these websites, and found that on average, the partici-
pants with autism were familiar to 90% of these websites,
and had account in 28% of them. However, the participants
without autism were familiar with 90% of the websites, and
had account in 47% of them.
• Knowledge of Secure connection and certificates: To measure
the participants’ knowledge of secure connection, we had
asked them if they had heard about secure shell and/or con-
figured firewall. Only 6.6% of the users (2 out of 30 partici-
pants) knew how SSH and firewall were configured. Inter-
estingly both these participants had autism, and these users
also turned out to be the best performers of the phishing
detection task with the accuracy above 95%. None of the
participants without autism in our study had heard about
secure shell and/or configured the firewall.
• Computer Skills: We wanted to compare the computer skills
of the users with their phishing detection performance. Com-
puter skills relate to programming and designing of websites,
among other things. The average self-rating of the com-
puter skill of the participants with autism was about 7 on a
scale of 10, and the participants without autism was 6 out of
10. We did not find any statistically significant correlation
between computer skill, and the users phishing detection
performance, however. Also, to know the extent of their tech-
nical capacity, we had asked the participants if they had ever
registered a domain or ever designed a website. Only 15%
of the participants (all belonging to the group with autism)
had registered a domain, and had designed the website. We
did not have sufficient data to perform statistical analysis.
• Knowledge and Experience with Spam and Phishing: The par-
ticipants had to answer if they had ever seen a spam email
and explain why they are sent. 20% of the participants with
autism and 6% of the participants without autism reported
474
that they had never seen any spam email and do not know
why they are sent. The rest of the participants (both with and
without autism) mostly explained spam as emails sent to try
to get users’ information. Some of them mentioned: “spam
emails are sent to trick other people in believing in them”;
“shotgunning – if you send out enough, you’ll eventually
get a hit (a person will click on it)”; “people want to trick
other people”. One of the participants believed that spams
represent the bugs on the Internet. Upon using pearson’s
correlation, we observed strong statistically significant corre-
lation between their knowledge of spam and their phishing
detection performance in our study (r = .63, p < .05).
We also asked the participants if they knew what phish-
ing was and why phishing emails are used. 60% of the par-
ticipants with autism, and 94% of the participants without
autism reported that they had heard of phishing and prop-
erly defined phishing attacks. Some reported phishing as: “an
email that will send you a link to go to a fake website to try to
steal your information”, while some defined phishing as: “a
fake website that looks like a real one to get a person’s infor-
mation and steal/sell that info”. Some even defined phishing
as an impostor: “where someone poses as an established
company in order to gain access to credentials under false
pretenses”. We performed pearson’s correlation test to under-
stand relationship between phishing detection accuracy and
the phishing knowledge among all of the participants, and
observed strong statistically significant correlation between
them (r = .65, p < .05).
• Strategies of Phishing Detection: We had asked the partici-
pants if they had noticed any differences in the websites
as they were repeatedly presented to them in the experi-
ment. This would help us know if the participants actually
noticed the differences in the websites presented to them or
were randomly marking them as real and fake. 80% of the
participants with autism reported that they detected some
differences on the websites repeatedly shown to them. They
said: “some did not have the same logo’,“URLs and logos
were different”,“sometimes they have different certificates,
URLs”. 90% of the participants without autism also reported
that they had detected some differences. Some of them said:
’the logo on the tab of the browser, and the logo included in
the website were different’,’some websites were secure, and
