### 5.1.2 Performance Analysis: Familiar Websites

In this analysis, we calculated the accuracy and response times for detecting the legitimacy of only familiar websites. Both real and fake versions of the websites deemed familiar by the users were considered. Table 4 summarizes our results.

**Table 4: Control Participants: Average (µ) and Standard Deviation (σ) of Accuracy and Response Time Across Familiar Websites**

| Trial   | Real         | Fake         | EFake        | DFake        | Overall      |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Accuracy| 76.2 (20.4)  | 78.2 (19.2)  | 83.4 (15.1)  | 72.8 (29.1)  | 77.2 (14.1)  |
| Response Time | 1.9 (0.5)  | 1.9 (0.5)    | 2.1 (0.5)    | 1.8 (0.7)    | 1.9 (0.3)    |

The overall accuracy of correctly identifying a familiar website is around 77%, which is better than random guessing (50%). We observe that the accuracy of identifying easy fake websites is higher than other types of websites. However, the Friedman’s test did not reveal statistically significant differences in mean accuracies and response times across real, fake, easy fake, and difficult fake websites.

### 5.2 Participants with Autism

In this section, we analyze the accuracy and response times measured during our study for participants with autism. This group serves as the target class for our study.

#### 5.2.1 Performance Analysis: All Websites

Similar to the analysis of control participants, we consider all websites (familiar and unfamiliar) presented in the experiment. Table 5 summarizes our results.

**Table 5: Participants with Autism: Average (µ) and Standard Deviation (σ) of Accuracy and Response Time Across All Websites**

| Trial   | Real         | Fake         | EFake        | DFake        | Overall      |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Accuracy| 80.6 (17.4)  | 68.9 (25.1)  | 72.6 (21.2)  | 64.9 (30.8)  | 74.8 (19.0)  |
| Response Time | 2.0 (0.5)  | 1.7 (0.5)    | 1.8 (0.5)    | 1.6 (0.6)    | 1.8 (0.4)    |

From Table 5, the overall accuracy of phishing detection is around 74%, which is better than random guessing (50%). The accuracy of identifying real websites is higher than that of identifying fake websites. However, the Friedman’s test did not show statistically significant differences among the mean accuracies of real, fake, easy fake, and difficult fake websites.

#### 5.2.2 Performance Analysis: Familiar Websites

To enable website familiarity analysis, we asked participants in the post-experiment phase whether they had an account with the websites presented in the study. Table 6 summarizes the results for familiar websites.

**Table 6: Participants with Autism: Average (µ) and Standard Deviation (σ) of Accuracy and Response Time Across Familiar Websites**

| Trial   | Real         | Fake         | EFake        | DFake        | Overall      |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Accuracy| 86.6 (16.0)  | 69.1 (29.9)  | 69.6 (29.0)  | 63.4 (39.7)  | 75.2 (22.9)  |
| Response Time | 2.3 (0.8)  | 1.6 (0.7)    | 1.6 (0.7)    | 1.6 (1.0)    | 1.9 (0.7)    |

The overall accuracy of phishing detection for familiar websites was around 75%, which is only slightly better than a random guess. The Friedman’s test did not show statistically significant differences in mean accuracies across real, fake, easy fake, and difficult fake websites. However, there was a statistically significant difference in mean response time (χ²(3) = 13.8, p < .005). Further analysis using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (WSRT) showed that participants spent significantly more time on real websites compared to fake websites (p < .005).

### 5.3 Performance Comparison: Participants with Autism vs. Control Participants

To analyze the differences in performance between participants with and without autism in the phishing detection task, we performed the Mann-Whitney U Test. This non-parametric test compares the means of two samples from the same population. Our results did not show a statistically significant difference in the mean accuracy of identifying phishing websites between the two groups. This suggests that participants with autism may not be more susceptible to phishing attacks.

Previous studies [4, 8] have reported that individuals with autism are methodical and detail-oriented. Carper et al. [11] found that the symmetry in the brains of individuals with autism might make them more detail-oriented. Cybersecurity practitioners have also noted that people with autism possess strengths such as cognitive pattern recognition, attention to detail, logical and methodical thinking, focus, and integrity, which can be beneficial in corporate and intelligence sectors [3, 6]. In light of these aspects, participants with autism might have been careful and noticed differences in URLs, leading to accurate identification of many websites. Indeed, in the post-test questionnaire, participants with autism reported noticing differences in URLs and logos. Our study concludes that individuals with autism may not be more vulnerable to phishing attacks compared to typical users without autism.

### 5.4 Correlation: Autism Quotient vs. Accuracy and Response Time

We investigated the correlation between the autism scores (AQ score) and the accuracy and response time in detecting real, fake, easy fake, and difficult fake websites. Using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, we found no statistically significant correlation between the AQ score and the accuracy or response time for both all websites and only familiar websites. This suggests that the ability to detect phishing websites may be independent of the autism condition of the participants.

### 6 Qualitative Analysis

After completing the phishing detection task, both participants with and without autism were asked to fill out a post-test questionnaire. This questionnaire aimed to determine participants’ knowledge of computer security and privacy, including their strategies for identifying phishing websites. Below, we summarize the responses:

- **Security and Privacy Concerns:** 100% of participants (both with and without autism) reported being concerned about their security and privacy on the web and the leakage of passwords.
- **Web Browsing Behavior:** 100% of participants browse the Internet daily for various purposes, including online purchases, bill payments, news reading, online banking, and social networking. On average, participants with autism were familiar with 90% of the websites and had accounts in 28% of them, while participants without autism were familiar with 90% of the websites and had accounts in 47% of them.
- **Knowledge of Secure Connections and Certificates:** Only 6.6% of participants (2 out of 30, both with autism) knew how to configure SSH and firewalls. These participants also had the highest accuracy in the phishing detection task (above 95%).
- **Computer Skills:** The average self-rated computer skill of participants with autism was 7 out of 10, while for those without autism, it was 6 out of 10. There was no statistically significant correlation between computer skills and phishing detection performance. Additionally, 15% of participants with autism had registered a domain and designed a website.
- **Knowledge and Experience with Spam and Phishing:** 20% of participants with autism and 6% of those without autism had never seen spam emails. The rest defined spam as emails sent to trick users into providing information. Pearson’s correlation test showed a strong, statistically significant correlation between knowledge of spam and phishing detection performance (r = .63, p < .05). Similarly, 60% of participants with autism and 94% of those without autism had heard of phishing and could define it. Pearson’s correlation test also showed a strong, statistically significant correlation between phishing knowledge and detection accuracy (r = .65, p < .05).
- **Strategies of Phishing Detection:** 80% of participants with autism and 90% of those without autism reported noticing differences in the websites, such as different logos and URLs, which helped them in making their decisions.
