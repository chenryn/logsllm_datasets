4 METHODOLOGY
To evaluate Double Patterns (DPatts), we developed an online,
browser-based survey and recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk
(MTurk). Using their own personal mobile devices, participants
completed the survey by creating/recalling a DPatt, as well as an-
swering questions about their experience. For the main study, we
recruited n = 634 participants in three treatments: a control treat-
ment and two blocklist treatments. The complete survey material
can be found in Appendix A.
4.1 Survey Outline
There are 12 sections to the survey. Participants are first informed
about DPatts and allowed to practice creating DPatts, before being
tasked to select one that they might use to unlock their smartphone.
Following, participants answer questions about their experience
selecting a DPatt and the perceived usability and security, before
being asked to recall their selected DPatt. It took participants, on
average, 7.3 minutes to complete the survey; the survey, in its
entirety, can be found in Appendix A. The protocol for the study
was approved by the IRB of our institution(s).
(1) Purpose of Study/Informed Consent: Participants were in-
formed about (and consented to) the study before proceeding,
this included details that participants would be asked to se-
lect/recall a Double Pattern and answer questions about their
experiences.
(2) Device Usage: Participants were asked to provide background
on the number of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) they
currently use, as well as which mobile authentication method
they currently use to unlock their devices. For those that
indicated that they use a biometric, we provided a follow
up question asking how the participant unlocks their device
following a phone reset, or when their biometric fails. Details
of the device usage can be found in Table 1, and just over
25% of our participants use a Android pattern to secure their
smartphone.

(3) Android Patterns/Double Patterns Background: As not all par-
ticipants were familiar with Android patterns, we provide
information about them as well as how they related to Dou-
ble Patterns, such as:“Double Pattern Locks are the same as
Pattern Locks but require you to ‘draw’ two shapes on the
same 3x3 grid of contact points. The combination of the two
patterns entered in the same order is now used to unlock
your smartphone.”
(4) Practice: Participants were presented with the DPatt interface
and asked to practice using it by creating (and confirming)
a DPatt before proceeding. This provided familiarity and
ensured that participants’ first interaction would not be used
as part of the analysis.
(5) Instructions: Now familiar, participants were informed that
the next DPatt selected would be used as part of the study.
They were asked to “create a Double Pattern you would
likely use for a personal device unlock, such as you would
use on your smartphone.” They were also instructed that
“you will need to recall this Double Pattern later in the sur-
vey, so choose something that is secure and memorable.”
Two confirmations were requested at this point: (a) that the
participant understood that they are supposed to create a
Double Pattern for a personal device unlock, and (b) that
they should not write down their Double Pattern or use other
aids to help them remember it.
(6) Selection: Participants were then instructed to select a DPatt,
and the instructions to select something for unlocking their
smartphone were also included on this page (see Figure 1).
During selection, a participant may experience an enforcing
blocklist, which disallows a predetermined set of DPatts. We
describe the treatments below in Section 4.2.
(7) Post-Entry: After selection participants are asked Likert agree-
ment for two statements: if the DPatt provides adequate
security for unlocking their device, and their difficulty in
selecting the DPatt. As well, participants were asked an open-
text response regarding their strategy in selecting the DPatt
they chose.
(8) SUS: The 10 question System Usability Scale was then ad-
ministered to determine the perceived usability of DPatt.
(9) Recall: After the distractor tasks above, participants were
asked to recall their selected DPatt. After five attempts, if
they were unable to recall their DPatt, participants were al-
lowed to indicate that they could not remember and proceed
with the survey.
(10) Security Comparison: Participants were then asked about
the perceived security of DPatt itself, and to compare it
to Android patterns, 4-digit PINs, 6-digit PINs, and alpha-
numeric passwords using a Likert agreement scale.
(11) Use Double Pattern from Survey: Then, participates could
indicate and explain if they would use the DPatt selected
in the survey as their own unlock authentication, if Double
Patterns were used, or if they would choose a different DPatt
(or were unsure.)
(12) Demographics: Finally, participants were asked to provide
demographic information, such age, identified gender, domi-
nant hand, education, and technical background.

4.2 Treatments
Each participant was randomly assigned a treatment:
intervention when selecting/recalling a Double Pattern.
• Control: In the control treatment participants received no
• BL-First: In the blocklist first (or BL-First) treatment, a block-
list of first component patterns (the first of the two patterns
in a DPatt) was used to restrict the choices of Double Patterns.
After entering the first pattern, and before proceeding to se-
lect the second pattern, the participant would be prompted
to change their pattern if the first pattern is blocklisted, and
would need to continue to select first patterns until one is
chosen that is not blocklisted, after which they proceed to
selecting their second pattern.
• BL-Both: In the blocklist both (or BL-Both) treatment, a block-
list is used to match both patterns of a DPatt against a block-
list of disallowed Double Patterns. If the participants selec-
tion is blocklisted, they are required to select a different
DPatt until they select one that is not blocklisted.
To determine the blocklists, we relied on data collected during
prototyping of the survey with n = 286 participants. During the
prototype, we asked participants to select two different Double
Patterns (572 total), one for two different scenarios as described in
Loge et al. [18], either a shopping cart, banking account, or mobile
unlock. Participants always select a mobile unlock, and then either
shopping cart or banking account.
For the BL-First treatment, we used the top 20 most common first
pattern occurrences, and for the BL-Both pattern, we constructed a
blocklist from the 20 most common Double Patterns. There is not
prior work on blocklist sizes for patterns, and so we focused on a
short blocklist rather than an expansive one. The blocklists used
can be found in Appendix B. A visual for the blocklist message can
be found in Figure 2, which matches the blocklist message from
iOS [19], modified for patterns.
The main study differed from the prototype in three main ways.
First, as we did not observe major differences between the scenarios,
we elected to have participants focus on just the smartphone unlock
