### Double Patterns (DPatts) Evaluation: Methodology and Survey Design

#### 4. Methodology
To evaluate the usability and security of Double Patterns (DPatts), we designed an online, browser-based survey and recruited participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants used their personal mobile devices to complete the survey, which involved creating and recalling a DPatt, as well as answering questions about their experience. For the main study, we recruited 634 participants across three treatment groups: a control group and two blocklist groups. The full survey materials are provided in Appendix A.

#### 4.1 Survey Outline
The survey consists of 12 sections, designed to guide participants through the process of creating and evaluating a DPatt. Below is a detailed outline of each section:

1. **Purpose of Study/Informed Consent**:
   - Participants were informed about the study's purpose and provided consent. They were told that they would be asked to select and recall a Double Pattern and answer questions about their experiences.

2. **Device Usage**:
   - Participants provided information on the number of mobile devices they use and their current authentication methods. For those using biometrics, a follow-up question was asked about how they unlock their device after a reset or when biometrics fail. Approximately 25% of participants use an Android pattern to secure their smartphones.

3. **Android Patterns/Double Patterns Background**:
   - To ensure all participants understood the concept, we provided an explanation of Android patterns and introduced Double Patterns: "Double Pattern Locks are similar to Pattern Locks but require you to draw two shapes on the same 3x3 grid. The combination of the two patterns in the same order is used to unlock your smartphone."

4. **Practice**:
   - Participants were given the opportunity to practice creating and confirming a DPatt. This step ensured familiarity with the interface and prevented the first interaction from being part of the analysis.

5. **Instructions**:
   - After the practice, participants were instructed to create a DPatt they would likely use for unlocking their personal device. They were reminded to choose something secure and memorable and confirmed that they understood the instructions.

6. **Selection**:
   - Participants selected a DPatt, with the option to experience an enforcing blocklist that disallows certain predetermined patterns. The specific treatments are described in Section 4.2.

7. **Post-Entry**:
   - Participants rated their agreement on two statements: the DPatt's perceived security and the difficulty in selecting it. They also provided an open-text response on their selection strategy.

8. **System Usability Scale (SUS)**:
   - The 10-question SUS was administered to assess the perceived usability of the DPatt.

9. **Recall**:
   - Participants were asked to recall their selected DPatt. If unable to recall after five attempts, they could indicate that they could not remember and proceed with the survey.

10. **Security Comparison**:
    - Participants compared the perceived security of DPatt to other authentication methods (e.g., Android patterns, 4-digit PINs, 6-digit PINs, and alphanumeric passwords) using a Likert scale.

11. **Use Double Pattern from Survey**:
    - Participants indicated whether they would use the DPatt they selected in the survey for their own device and explained their reasoning.

12. **Demographics**:
    - Finally, participants provided demographic information, including age, gender, dominant hand, education, and technical background.

#### 4.2 Treatments
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments:

- **Control**:
  - No blocklist intervention was applied.

- **BL-First**:
  - A blocklist of the first component patterns (the first of the two patterns in a DPatt) was used. If the first pattern was blocklisted, participants had to select a different first pattern before proceeding to the second pattern.

- **BL-Both**:
  - A blocklist was used to match both patterns of a DPatt against a list of disallowed Double Patterns. If the selected DPatt was blocklisted, participants had to choose a different DPatt until one was selected that was not blocklisted.

#### Blocklist Determination
The blocklists were determined based on data from a prototype survey with 286 participants. Participants were asked to select two different Double Patterns for different scenarios (e.g., shopping cart, banking account, or mobile unlock). For the BL-First treatment, the top 20 most common first patterns were used. For the BL-Both treatment, the 20 most common Double Patterns were used. The blocklists are provided in Appendix B, and a visual representation of the blocklist message is shown in Figure 2, adapted from iOS [19].

#### Differences from Prototype
The main study differed from the prototype in three key ways:
1. Focus on smartphone unlock only, as no significant differences were observed between scenarios.
2. Use of a short, focused blocklist rather than an extensive one.
3. Enhanced instructions and feedback mechanisms to improve participant understanding and compliance.
