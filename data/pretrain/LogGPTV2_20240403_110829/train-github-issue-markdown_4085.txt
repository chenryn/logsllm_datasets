Hi!  
I test some `big` images which `exifRotation` is 90.  
When using okhttp, it showed very very slow, about `5 - 10` seconds.  
But, showed fast if not using okhttp!
When using okhttp:  
If set `diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.SOURCE)`, it will show faster!  
If set `override()` with a smaller size, it is also showed faster!  
If `exifRotation` is 0, it is also showed faster!
My test images is: (put into sdcard, load from sdcard)
