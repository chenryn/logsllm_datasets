Subject: Assistance Required: Obtaining SHA-1 Certificate for Firebase Auth Integration with Flutter

Hello,

I am currently working on integrating Firebase Authentication into a Flutter application. As part of this process, I need to register my Android app with Firebase, which requires the SHA-1 certificate for enabling Google Sign-In.

In a typical Android project, I would obtain the SHA-1 certificate by accessing the **Gradle Panel** located on the right-hand side of Android Studio and then executing the **`signingReport` Gradle task**. However, in a Flutter project, I cannot find this panel or an equivalent method to generate the signing report.

I have already attempted to seek help through a Stack Overflow question, but after two days, I have not received any responses. 

Could you please provide guidance on how to conveniently retrieve the SHA-1 certificate for a Flutter application? If there is an existing solution or a recommended approach, I would greatly appreciate your assistance.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
