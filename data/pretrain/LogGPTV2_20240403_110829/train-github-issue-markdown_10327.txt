Hi. I'm trying to integrate Firebase Auth with Flutter. For that I need to
register my Android App with Firebase. For Google Sign-In, I require the SHA-1
Certificate of my Android App.
On a regular app, this used to be possible by going to the **Gradle Panel** on
the right hand side and executing the **`signingReport` Gradle Task**. However
on the flutter app, there is no such Panel, and I can't find any way to show
it.
I've also posted a StackOverflow Question, which has been there for 2 days but
has no response. Please allow for a way to get a flutter app's SHA-1
certificate conveniently. If a solution to this already exists, please let me
know.
