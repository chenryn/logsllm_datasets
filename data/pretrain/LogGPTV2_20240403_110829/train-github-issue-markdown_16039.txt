Is there a reason why allow-env does not support a whitelist?
I like the idea of knowing explicitly what environment variables the program
can access. Often a program should only be able to access a few variables such
as `DEBUG`.
Example invocation
    DEBUG=* deno run --allow-env=DEBUG,TEST main.tsx
Of course the current alternative is something like this:
    env -i HOME=$HOME PWD=$PWD PATH=$PATH DEBUG=* TEST=$TEST deno run --allow-env main.ts
