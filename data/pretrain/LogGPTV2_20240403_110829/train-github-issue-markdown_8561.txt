We converted our RDF dataset into nodes and relationships and then used the `neo4j-import` tool to import this data. To optimize performance, we modified the `_JVM_size_`, `_dbms.memory.heap.initial_size_`, and `_dbms.memory.heap.max_size_` parameters in the `neo4j.conf` file. The available resources after these adjustments are as follows:

- Total machine memory: 125.52 GB
- Free machine memory: 122.06 GB
- Max heap memory: 26.67 GB
- Processors: 32
- Configured max memory: 85.86 GB

However, during the import process, specifically when processing the relationship counts, the import failed with the following error:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
```

This error indicates that the Garbage Collection (GC) overhead limit has been exceeded, which is related to the heap memory. We attempted various methods to resolve this issue, but they were unsuccessful. Additionally, we observed that the memory usage remained consistently high throughout the import process.

**How can we overcome this problem? Is it possible that Neo4j, even with 128 GB of memory, cannot handle the import of such a large dataset?**

### Possible Solutions

1. **Increase Heap Memory**: Ensure that the heap memory settings are optimized. You may need to increase the `dbms.memory.heap.initial_size` and `dbms.memory.heap.max_size` further, but be cautious not to exceed the total available memory.

2. **Tune Garbage Collection Settings**: Adjust the garbage collection settings to better handle large datasets. This might involve changing the garbage collector type or tuning specific GC parameters.

3. **Batch Import**: Consider breaking the dataset into smaller batches and importing them sequentially. This can help manage memory usage more effectively.

4. **Use a Different Import Tool**: If `neo4j-import` continues to fail, you might want to explore other tools or methods for importing large datasets, such as using APOC procedures or the Neo4j ETL framework.

5. **Optimize Data Structure**: Review the structure of your data and ensure that it is optimized for import. Reducing the number of relationships or optimizing the node and relationship properties can sometimes help.

By exploring these options, you should be able to identify a solution that allows you to successfully import your dataset into Neo4j.
