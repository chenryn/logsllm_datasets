We convert our RDF data set to Nodes and Relationships. And then we use
`neo4j-import` to import this data set.  
Since we have change the _JVM_size_ and _dbms.memory.heap.initial_size_ and
_dbms.memory.heap.max_size_ in `neo4j.conf`, and the available resources
output is shown below:
> Total machine memory: 125.52 GB  
>  Free machine memory: 122.06 GB  
>  Max heap memory: 26.67 GB  
>  Processors: 32  
>  Configured max memory: 85.86 GB
However, when it comes to _Relationship counts_ , **import failed** because of
the following Error:
> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit
> exceeded
We know it's about Garbage Collection and Heap Memory, and we try our methods
to overcome this error but failed. Also, when the import is running, the
memory used is full all the time.
**So, how could we overcome this problem? Or neo4j with 128GB memory can't
import so much a data set?**
