and the second is an Active Tuned Mass Damper (ATMD) where
the mass is connected to the structure through an actuator, a spring,
and a damping device [73]. The latter is known as Hybrid control
because it is a combination of an active component (actuator) and
a passive component (spring and damping) that increase the reli-
ability of the system if there is a malfunction of the actuator, an
energy outage, or, in this case, a cyberattack.

tends to disable the actuators located in the top floors. This is in-
tuitive as actuators in the top floors can compensate better the
vibrations in the building.
To show that our attacks are optimal, we compare our results
with random disconnections of actuators. Fig. 20 shows that our
optimal attack is considerably more effective.
7 ATTACKING A BUILDING WITH ACTIVE
DAMPERS
We use the same 20-story benchmark building but the control sys-
tem is replaced by two different mass damper systems as shown in
Fig. 21. The first one is an Active Mass Damper (AMD) where an
auxiliary mass is connected to the structure through an actuator,
Figure 21: a) Benchmark 20-story high-rise building with a
mass damper, b) AMD model, c) and ATMD model.
The state variables of the vector x for this case are the displace-
ment and velocity of each of the 20 stories, as well as the displace-
ment and velocity of the auxiliary mass. Similar to the previous
case study, the output vector z in Eq. (1) is a vector of the ISD for
each floor.
First the AMD is considered with a mass ratio of 2% of the first
modal mass, corresponding to 332 tons, an actuator with maximum
capacity of 2MN, a maximum stroke of 50 cm, and an LQR control
algorithm [47]. The LQR is designed with the identity matrix and
a control force weight as ùëÖ = 10‚àí14. The ATMD is considered
with the same mass ratio, actuator and LQR controller as the AMD,
and the optimal tuning of the spring and damping is evaluated

limited by the stroke of the actuator, this state is bounded during
the simulation by generating a stopping force [19].
Our study shows that i) a DoS attack to the single actuator can
compromise the integrity of the structure, and additionally, the
attacks are more successful on the AMD than the ATMD thanks
to the additional reduction of vibrations provided by the passive
component of the ATMD; and ii) FDI attacks that are able to inject
energy to the system causing similar or worse damages than those
caused by natural hazards. Contrarily to the DoS results, the FDI
is more effective on the ATMD than the AMD because the passive
component assists the oscillation of the attacking signal.

Figure 22: Maximum ISD ratio per floor for the AMD and
ATMD systems controlled and under a DoS attack
The system was subjected to a Kobe earthquake disturbance,
with a scaling factor of 0.4. In Fig. 22, the maximum ISD per floor
can be seen when the Kobe disturbance was applied to the ATMD
and AMD systems, both controlled and attacked. Note that the
DoS attack generates higher ISD ratios for the AMD system. This
can be explained by the passive dynamics involved in the ATMD
model. When the AMD actuator is disconnected, the system is
essentially left as if no preventive measure was installed. On the
contrary, when the ATMD actuator is disconnected, there still is
a passive component mitigating the effect of the disturbance by a
small margin. However, the DoS attack is highly effective in both
cases, where floors 15 and 18 surpass de 1% limit even when they
were within safe ranges on the controlled system
A more detailed effect of the DoS attack can be seen in Fig. 23.
Even though the maximum ISD ratio of the roof is higher than 1%
for the four simulated systems, it is still considerably higher when
the DoS attack is performed. It is also notable how other ISD ratio
values are mitigated in other instants of the time response by the
control system, which reduce the oscillations performed by the
system, diminishing the overall damage to the structure during the
earthquake. All of this proves the effectiveness of the DoS attack,
and while it may be slightly more effective in the AMD system,
disabling the actuator causes high damage in both systems.
7.2 FDI Attack
The FDI attack was designed by using the two step process from
section 4.3. We obtained the frequency response in Fig. 24 from
the singular value decomposition of the systems. The specified ùêª‚àû
norm is the maximum value seen in the plot. The frequencies for
both systems are very similar: ùêªùúîùêπ ùê∑ùêº = 0.2847Hz for the AMD
and ùêªùúîùêπ ùê∑ùêº = 0.2787Hz for the ATMD. Despite this similarity, we
can predict that the FDI attack will be more effective on the ATMD
system, since the ùêª‚àû norm is higher for this case.
Figures 25 and 26 present the Maximum ISD ratios per floor and
the ISD ratio of the roof during the attack for the injected signal. As
predicted by the SVD analysis, the attack has a significantly higher
impact for the ATMD system, where the ISD ratios are over 1% for
every floor, and as high as 3% on the roof. This means that a critical
damage is achieved for the entire building structure. As for the FDI
attack on the AMD system, it has less significant effects. In spite
of this, permanent damage is achieved on the structure on floors
15 and 20, which shows that this attack still can have devastating
consequences on both systems.

Figure 26: Time response of the roof ISD ratio during the FDI
attack.
Fig. 26 reveals that the system has repeated oscillations over
the maximum ISD ratio. This means that every additional oscilla-
tion will be even more damaging. While ISD ratios above 1% are
achieved for only a few instants during an earthquake (even when a
DoS attack is performed), values above 1% are achieved repeatedly
during the FDI attack. Furthermore, this attack requires no external
disturbance to generate damage to the structures. Consequently,
for active dampers, an FDI attack poses a greater danger than a DoS
attack.
