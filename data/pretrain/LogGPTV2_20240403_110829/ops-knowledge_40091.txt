User: So, I am trying to run a Shell script from Python and I double checked that the location of the script.sh is all correct (because when I run it from sublime, the script.sh opens). What I have to call script.sh is:
subprocess.call("script.sh", shell=True)
When I run that, the function returns 0. However, the script is supposed to create a file in my folder and write into it, which it is not doing. It does work when I run the script from cygwin command prompt.
What could be wrong?
Assistant: Please ensure you have added:
!/bin/bash
as the first line and also make sure that the file script.sh has executable permission.
chmod u+x script.sh
then try specifying the complete path:
subprocess.call("/complete/path/script.sh", shell=True)
