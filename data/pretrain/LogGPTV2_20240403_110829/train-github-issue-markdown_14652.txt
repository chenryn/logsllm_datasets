### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**  
v5.0.1
  * **Operating System:**  
Linux Mint 19.1, using the Cinnamon desktop environment
### Expected Behavior
When creating a tray and setting a click event (but no context menu) it was
expected that the event would trigger when clicking directly on the tray icon.
### Actual Behavior
Instead the tray displays a context menu with a normal menu item that uses as
label the tray tooltip (or the project name if no tooltip has been set). The
click event is triggered when clicking on the menu item, not on the tray icon.  
Also since the tooltip is used to create a menu item, none appears when
hovering the tray icon.
### To Reproduce
Here's the repo for my project :
PI:EMAIL:chrisalexandrepena/googledrive_linux.git  
The index.js only creates a tray with click event that opens a window.  
All that is needed to run the code is:  
$ git clone PI:EMAIL:chrisalexandrepena/googledrive_linux.git  
$ npm install  
$ npm start
