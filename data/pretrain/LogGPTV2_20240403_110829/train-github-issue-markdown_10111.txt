According to the YAML specification at <http://yaml.org/type/merge.html>, it is possible to overwrite keys in merged maps. However, since the update in issue #10902, this functionality no longer works as expected, which significantly reduces the utility of merging with anchors.

Here's an example YAML to illustrate the issue:

```yaml
- key-with-duplicate: &alias1
    foo: bar
    foo: ignore  # This key should be ignored, as 'foo' is already defined

- key-without-duplicate: &alias2
    foo: other

- changed-value-before-merge:
    foo: overwrite
    <<: *alias1  # The 'foo' key should remain 'overwrite'

- changed-value-after-merge:
    <<: *alias1
    foo: overwrite  # The 'foo' key should be 'overwrite', but it may not be

- multiple-merges-as-repeat:
    <<: *alias1
    <<: *alias2  # The 'foo' key from *alias2 should overwrite the one from *alias1

- multiple-merges-as-array:
    <<: [*alias1, *alias2]  # The 'foo' key from *alias2 should overwrite the one from *alias1
```

I tested the following online YAML parsers, and none of them correctly handle the overwriting of keys during the merge process:
- <http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/>
- <http://yamltojson.com/>
- <http://nodeca.github.io/js-yaml/>

This inconsistency in behavior makes it difficult to rely on the merge feature for complex configurations.
