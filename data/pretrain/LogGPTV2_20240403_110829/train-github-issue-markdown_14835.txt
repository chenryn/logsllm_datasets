Maybe I'm misunderstanding, or doing something wrong, but I don't think
Secrets should be available in clear text by means of `kubectl describe
secrets` even if they are created using `kubectl apply -f`
# Example
my-secret.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: tls
    type: Opaque
    data:
      tls.crt: BASE64...
      tls.key: BASE64...
Commands:
    kubectl apply -f my-secret.yaml
    kubectl describe secrets my-secret
`kubectl describe` will have an "Annotations:" field which contains the entire
yaml file (as JSON), including my base64 encoded secrets:
    Name:       tls
    Namespace:  default
    Labels:     
    Annotations:    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration={"kind":"Secret","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"tls","creationTimestamp":null},"data":{"tls.crt":"BASE64...","tls.key":"BASE64..."},"type":"Opaque"}
    Type:   Opaque
    Data
    ====
    tls.key:    1565 bytes
    tls.crt:    1234 bytes
I appreciate that it's hard to `apply` something without storing last-applied-
configuration, but maybe Secrets should be treated as a special case?
