**Title: BotConf2020 - A Proposed Civil Liability Framework for Disrupting Botnets, with a Particular Focus on Smart Devices**

This paper introduces a legal framework designed to disrupt botnets, particularly those whose nodes are primarily composed of smart devices. The proposed methodology assigns civil liability to both the manufacturers and users of these smart devices if they become part of a botnet due to either the failure to develop a patch for a known vulnerability or the failure to apply an available patch. 

The paper also delineates a role for regulatory bodies, though it does not mandate their involvement for initiating a civil action. For a civil claim to be brought, the only requirement is that damage has occurred as a result of a cyberattack conducted by a botnet, and that the exploited vulnerability was known within the software industry.
