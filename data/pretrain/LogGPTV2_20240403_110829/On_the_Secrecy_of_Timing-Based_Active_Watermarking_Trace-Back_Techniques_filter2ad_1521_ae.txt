for the next packet. The values of A and B are determined
by the pre-selected false negative rate α and false positive
rate β for the SPRT algorithm: A = log((1 − β)/α) and
B = log(β/(1 − α)).
We have run simulations to validate the usefulness of
the SPRT algorithm. For ﬂows with normal network delays
with μ = 0 and σ = 10ms, we embed different watermarks
with θ changing from 0 to 0.5. S is set at 400ms. The
thresholds are chosen as θ0 = 0.05 and θ1 = 0.15. There-
fore to attackers, the watermarks with θ  1 and embedding packets are still reused.
The identiﬁed embedding packets will be processed by our
clustering algorithm and the embedding packets used for the
same watermark bits are grouped together. Then the average
IPDs between adjacent clusters are computed to decode the
watermark bits. The result is shown in Tables 6 and 7. In
this case, the recovery rates are slightly lower than Case I,
and there is no signiﬁcant variation for the different values
of S, M, L tested.
6.4. Watermark Duplication for Case III
In this experiment, a watermark bit is embedded on 1
IPD and the embedding packets are not reused. The du-

plication algorithm ﬁrst computes possible ﬁrst packets for
each watermark bit. We then generate a Tcplib [2] synthetic
trace, ﬁnd the optimum delays for all identiﬁed embedding
packets, and duplicate the watermark. Finally the real wa-
termark decoder decodes watermark W1 from the synthetic
trace and compares it with the real watermark W0. The du-
plication rate is the percentage of matched bits between W0
and W1. Figure 9 shows the duplicate rate changing with
S and K, and Figure 10 shows the duplicate rate changing
with L and K. Clearly K has negative impact on dupli-
cation. A larger K increases the number of possible ﬁrst
packets, thus reduces the duplication rate. On the contrary,
a larger S reduces the number of possible ﬁrst packets and
helps duplication. The impact of L on duplication is not
very signiﬁcant.
6.5. Watermark Duplication and Removal
for Case IV
In this experiment, we embed a watermark bit using mul-
tiple IPDs and embedding packets are not reused. The gen-
eral procedure is similar to Case III, except here we search
for multiple ﬁrst packets for each watermark bit. The dupli-
cation results are shown in Figures 11 and 12. We can see
K and M signiﬁcantly affect the duplication result. Good
duplication rates only appear for small M and K. When
M and K increase, the number of possible combinations of
