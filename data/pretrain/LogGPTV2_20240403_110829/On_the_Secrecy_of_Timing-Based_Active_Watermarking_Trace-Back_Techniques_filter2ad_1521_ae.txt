### Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) Algorithm

The values of \( A \) and \( B \) in the SPRT algorithm are determined by the pre-selected false negative rate \(\alpha\) and false positive rate \(\beta\):
\[ A = \log\left(\frac{1 - \beta}{\alpha}\right) \]
\[ B = \log\left(\frac{\beta}{1 - \alpha}\right) \]

### Simulation Validation

We conducted simulations to validate the effectiveness of the SPRT algorithm. For network flows with normal delays, where \(\mu = 0\) and \(\sigma = 10\) ms, we embedded different watermarks with \(\theta\) varying from 0 to 0.5. The parameter \( S \) was set to 400 ms, and the thresholds were chosen as \(\theta_0 = 0.05\) and \(\theta_1 = 0.15\). For attackers, the watermarks with \(\theta < 1\) and the embedding packets are still reused.

The identified embedding packets are processed by our clustering algorithm, and the packets used for the same watermark bits are grouped together. The average Inter-Packet Delays (IPDs) between adjacent clusters are then computed to decode the watermark bits. The results are shown in Tables 6 and 7. In this case, the recovery rates are slightly lower than in Case I, and there is no significant variation for the different values of \( S \), \( M \), and \( L \) tested.

### Watermark Duplication for Case III

In this experiment, a watermark bit is embedded in one IPD, and the embedding packets are not reused. The duplication algorithm first computes possible first packets for each watermark bit. We then generate a Tcplib [2] synthetic trace, find the optimum delays for all identified embedding packets, and duplicate the watermark. Finally, the real watermark decoder decodes watermark \( W_1 \) from the synthetic trace and compares it with the real watermark \( W_0 \). The duplication rate is the percentage of matched bits between \( W_0 \) and \( W_1 \).

- **Figure 9** shows the duplication rate changing with \( S \) and \( K \).
- **Figure 10** shows the duplication rate changing with \( L \) and \( K \).

Clearly, \( K \) has a negative impact on duplication. A larger \( K \) increases the number of possible first packets, thus reducing the duplication rate. Conversely, a larger \( S \) reduces the number of possible first packets and aids in duplication. The impact of \( L \) on duplication is not very significant.

### Watermark Duplication and Removal for Case IV

In this experiment, we embed a watermark bit using multiple IPDs, and the embedding packets are not reused. The general procedure is similar to Case III, except that here we search for multiple first packets for each watermark bit. The duplication results are shown in Figures 11 and 12. We can see that \( K \) and \( M \) significantly affect the duplication result. Good duplication rates only appear for small \( M \) and \( K \). As \( M \) and \( K \) increase, the number of possible combinations of first packets increases, leading to a decrease in the duplication rate.

- **Figure 11** shows the watermark duplication rate for \( M = 4 \).
- **Figure 12** shows the watermark duplication rate for different values of \( L \) and \( K \).

### SPRT Detection Rate

Table 8 summarizes the SPRT detection rates for both the original and modified SPRT algorithms.

| \( K \) | \( M = 1 \) | \( M = 4 \) | \( M = 6 \) | \( M = 8 \) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2       | 0.986       | 0.986       | 0.989       | 0.984       |
| 4       | 0.986       | 0.986       | 0.989       | 0.984       |
| 6       | 0.997       | 0           | 0           | 0           |

- **Original SPRT**: The detection rates are generally high but drop significantly for large \( M \) and \( K \).
- **Modified SPRT**: The detection rates are consistently high across all values of \( M \) and \( K \).

This analysis provides insights into the performance and robustness of the SPRT algorithm under different conditions.
