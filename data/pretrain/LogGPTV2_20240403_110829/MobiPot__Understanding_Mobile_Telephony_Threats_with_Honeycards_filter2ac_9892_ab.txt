• Mobile telephony fraud is a serious problem in China.
The Ministry of Public Security in China conﬁrmed
that over 400,000 users reported to be victims of tele-
phony abuse, and accounted for a loss of 10.7 billion
RMB (≈ 1.67 billion USD) in 2014 [28].
• The recording of calls is regulated in many countries,
making it hard to perform a similar study.
In US,
for example, the Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC) dictates a one-party consent for most of
its states, with the exclusion of California and few oth-
ers [3]. However, in China, there is no speciﬁc law for

publish on these sites on false pretexts, like free services or
highly discounted articles [1]. However, the challenge here is
that the fake proﬁle should be popular enough to be chosen
by the fraudsters.
The process of faking proﬁles and popularizing them is
slower as compared to commenting on popular posts/videos
as the fraudsters are highly likely to be already scraping
the popular sites and blogs. Honeycards can be posted as
comments on existing popular sites and blogs.
We identiﬁed social networking websites in China that
are expected to be crawled by cybercriminals. In particular,
we advertised our numbers via three of the most popular
social networking platforms, namely a micro-blogging site
Weibo (Chinese version of Facebook)2, a video streaming site
Youku (Chinese version of Youtube)3, and a blogging site
Baidu Space (discussion forum)4. We publicly advertised
honeycards with a message simulating a change of number
on these websites.
For example, we promoted on Weibo our “change of num-
ber” by embedding popular hashtags in our tweets. Mandela,
the ﬁrst anniversary of the death of the ### my cell phone
is lost, replaced with a new phone number: 18757194227.
For Youku, we used a script to automatically comment pop-
ular videos – one of this has been rendered over 5 million
times5.
Seeding Private Honeycards– Mobile Malware (mal1
and mal2).
Private honeycards are deﬁned as tokens which are not
seeded in the public domain but directly to fraudsters.
The popularity and adoption of smartphones has greatly
increased the spread of mobile malware, especially popular
platforms like Android. According to a recent threats re-
port [24], almost 800,000 new mobile malware are observed
per quarter. At the end of 2014, over 6 million samples are
known to be in the wild and 10% of them come from Asia,
in particular China. In a study of 1,200 Android malware
apps [36], the authors show that more than 50% of these
malicious apps steal personal information including phone
numbers and contacts.
Our second seeding technique consisted of running mobile
malware on a testing device which we conﬁgured with the
honeycards in the contact list. We tracked the leakage of the
contact list in two ways: a) by conﬁguring the handset with
the TaintDroid analysis framework [15]; b) by collecting the
network traﬃc generated by the malware samples that, e.g.
connected to C&C servers controlled by the attackers.
We obtained from 369 unique samples of malicious An-
droid applications (from 60 families) known to be leaking
private information from Trend Micro. Out of the 60 fam-
ilies, one half consisted of trojanized versions of legit soft-
ware (i.e., repackaged with malware) and the other half were
“standalone” malicious applications oﬀering for example fake
messaging, free wallpapers, ring tones, games, and sexual
content. We ran each malware on a Nexus 4 running An-
droid 4.3 for 5 minutes with manual interactions in order to
trigger possible leakages by, e.g., registering with the appli-
cations or engaging in gaming.
The samples were given to us in batches of three with
220, 140, and 9 samples respectively. We ran the ﬁrst batch
on Nov 19th 2014 and Dec 2th 2014 (repeating), the second
batch on Dec 11th 2014, and the third batch on Feb 19th
2015. The third batch consisted of malware used in the
sextortion campaign that was ongoing at the time when we
conducted the experiments [25]. Out of the 369 samples,
248 samples (i.e., 67%) successfully executed on our testing
device. By analyzing the 438MB of network traﬃc collected
at the gateway and the alerts generated by TaintDroid, we
identiﬁed 264 leakages towards 140 unique C&C servers. All
leakages occurred over the HTTP protocol.
Seeding Private Honeycards– Abuse Lists (abs1 and
abs2).
There are large number of web sites publishing suspicious
caller numbers, e.g., http://800notes.com. Making calls to
those numbers from the numbers associated with honeycards
is another approach to seed the honeycards.
We extracted 2,236 unique numbers (1,683 of which are
mobiles) from Lajidianhua6 – the largest provider of abuse
call lists in China – and contacted them with two honey-
cards. We used one of the two to send them an engaging
SMS message and the other to make a one-ring call to them.
Our engaging SMS message reads as I am ﬁne with our dis-
cussion. How do we proceed?
In Section 6, we discuss some other seeding methods that
we leave as future work.

In this section, we present the results of our deployment
of MobiPot in China over seven months from August 22th,
2014 to March 27th, 2015. We collected 1,021 SMS mes-

We also received 66 MMS messages that we ignored because
they were not supported by the GSM-VoIP gateway. We
ﬁrst describe our pre-processing of the collected data to ﬁl-
ter out noise. We also provide volume and temporal charac-
teristics of unsolicited calls/SMS messages. Thereafter, we
discuss the eﬀectiveness of our seeding techniques. Finally,
we present a few interesting case studies as results of our
analysis.
4.1 Unsolicited Calls and SMS Messages
We set up MobiPot to understand the ecosystem behind
unsolicited SMS messages and calls that potentially come
from fraudsters who abuse the telephony channel. However,
not all the calls and SMS messages received on MobiPot are
unsolicited. There are multiple reasons why some of them
are not. a) The calls and SMS messages received could be
the result of misdialing by legitimate users. b) honeycards
could have been previously assigned to another legitimate
entity, which may lead to SMS messages and calls received
during our experiments which are meant for those entities.
To decide if a call or SMS message is unsolicited, we adopted
a semi-automated approach. Note that in our deﬁnition of
unsolicited, we included unwanted content like spam or robo-
calls that are not necessarily malicious per-se, but are gen-
erally annoying to the user and not wanted.
We ﬁrst transcribe all calls with an external transcription
service called Wanbo Steno [33]. With all calls transcribed
into Chinese text, we translated SMS and call content into
English using Google Translate. Before the classiﬁcation
into unsolicited and benign which is a manual process that
is tedious and error prone, we automatically cluster the SMS
messages and calls into groups to aid the manual process.
We used a hierarchical clustering algorithm with Leven-
shtein as the distance metric and Dunn index to cut the
dendrogram. In cases where a URL is embedded in an SMS
message, we adopted the web-reputation service oﬀered by
Trend Micro to classify it. We automatically labeled all SMS
messages as unsolicited that include malicious URL. Calls
and the remaining SMS messages were manually classiﬁed
by two researchers with the aid of the automatic clustering
results.
Using this approach, we classiﬁed 847 (82.95%) SMS mes-
sages and 366 (57.73%) calls as unsolicited. In total, there
were 215 sources who sent messages to at-least one of the
honeycards.
4.2 Volume and Temporal Characteristics
In this subsection, we provide insights into the temporal
calls and SMS messages patterns received on MobiPot (see
Figure 2). We show the diurnal volume for both benign and
unsolicited SMS messages and calls. As it can be noticed,
on almost all days, MobiPot received more unsolicited calls
and SMS messages as compared to the benign ones.
We collected on average 3.88 unsolicited SMS messages
and 1.68 unsolicited calls per day. There was an increase
in daily SMS message volume from December 2014 onward
during which we performed various seeding exercises on the
honeycards (see Figure 2(a)). We explain the eﬀects of seed-
ing in the following subsections in more detail.
An interesting observation of the benign SMS message
and call volume is that it was very high on two occasions
– much higher than that for unsolicited one. These sharp

(c) Hourly Volume (SMS)
(d) Hourly Volume (Call)
Figure 2: Overall volume
increases also coincide with the dates of our seeding, espe-
cially with seeding of the two honeycards with abuse lists
abs1 and abs2. By checking the sources of these benign
SMS messages and calls, we conﬁrm that almost all of them
are from the abuse lists that we called during the seeding
period. They were not classiﬁed as unsolicited because the
content appears to be benign. This suggests that a large
portion of the numbers on the abuse lists are actually be-
nign. We further investigate this suspicion and discuss it in
Section 4.8.
Figure 2(c) and 2(d) report the hourly distribution of calls
and SMS messages. We observe that most of the traﬃc
was made during business hours. This conﬁrms the ﬁndings
reported by [13] that most attack sources blend in with the
normal telephony traﬃc to appear legitimate.
4.3 Honeycards
In this section, we provide details of the unsolicited SMS
messages and calls received on each of the honeycards. Ta-
ble 2 shows a breakdown of the SMS messages and calls
received over the period when the MobiPot was running.
The ﬁrst interesting result is that there is a higher likeli-
hood of getting an unsolicited message as compared to unso-
licited call. As we can see from Table 2(a), all the messages
received on nsd1, mal1 and mal2 were unsolicited. Moreover,
there were 664 out of 679 messages (97.79%) received on six
out of eight honeycards (excluding abs1 and abs2, due to
reasons explained in Section 4.2) were unsolicited. On the
other hand, 241 out of 286 (84%) calls were unsolicited after
excluding abs1 and abs2.
During the entire timeframe when the MobiPot was run-
ning, soc1 received the largest number (and percentage) of
abuse calls and messages – 303 out of 317 or 95.58% of the
hits on soc1 were unsolicited. On the other hand, abs1 re-
ceived the smallest number of unsolicited calls and messages
(49 out 190, or 25%). abs1 was also the worst performer
in terms of percentage of unsolicited calls and messages re-
ceived.
As we can notice, the two numbers seeded in the same way
diﬀer considerably in the messages and calls received. We
