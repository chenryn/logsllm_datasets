Attempt to run a python program using a single line problem matcher. For
example, use the tasks.json from
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29987840/how-to-execute-python-code-from-
within-visual-studio-code, except make it a test command or build command so
you can run with a shortcut. Run on an app.py file containing some error, like
it only contains the code `1.foo`.
The problem matcher defined in the task.json only works with single line error
output, but Python delivers multiline output. I assume this is what is causing
VSCode to freeze. It (at least for me) can't be closed except by killing the
process.
I'm running the latest VSCode version on Windows 10.
