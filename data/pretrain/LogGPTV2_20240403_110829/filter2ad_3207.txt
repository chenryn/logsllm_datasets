ABSTRACT
Security and privacy in smartphones and mobile devices is
an emerging area which has received signiﬁcant attention
from the research community during the past few years.
The SPSM workshop was created to bring together these re-
searchers and practitioners. Following the success of the two
previous editions, we present this third edition of the work-
shop which has attracted signiﬁcantly more submissions and
beneﬁted from the expertise of an expanded international
program committee.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile devices such as smartphones and Internet tablets
have achieved computing and networking capabilities com-
parable to traditional personal computers. Their successful
consumerization has also become a source of pain for adopt-
ing users and organizations. For example, the widespread
presence of information-stealing applications raises substan-
tial security and privacy concerns. The operating systems
supporting these new devices have both advantages and dis-
advantages with respect to security. On one hand, they use
application sandboxing to contain exploits and limit privi-
leges given to malware. On the other hand, they routinely

collect and organize many forms of security- and privacy-
sensitive information and make that information easily ac-
cessible to third-party applications. Recognizing smartphone
security and privacy as an emerging area, this workshop
was launched three years ago to provide a venue for in-
terested researchers and practitioners to get together and
exchange ideas. We set out to organize the third workshop
in the series, building on the success of the two previous
well-attended editions.
2. TOPICS OF INTEREST
Authors were invited to submit either Full Research Pa-
pers (of up to 12 pages) or Short Papers (of up to 6 pages).
Full Research Papers that present relatively complete and
mature research results on security and privacy in smart-
phones and mobile devices were solicited. Short Papers that
deﬁne new problems in security and privacy related to smart-
phones and mobile devices or provide inspiring visions were
also solicited. The call for papers highlighted the following
topics of interest.
• Device/hardware security
• OS/Middleware security
• Application security
• Authenticating users to devices and services
• Mobile Web Browsers
• Usability
• Privacy
• Rogue application detection and recovery
• Vulnerability detection and remediation
• Secure application development
• Cloud support for mobile security
We especially encouraged novel paradigms and controver-
sial ideas that are not on the above list. The workshop
is to act as a venue for creative debate and interaction in
security- and privacy-sensitive areas of computing and com-
munication impacted by smartphones.

We received a record 54 submissions this year. They came
from 19 diﬀerent countries in Europe, North America, Asia
and Africa. The program committee accepted 5 full papers
and 8 short papers that cover a variety of topics, includ-
ing detecting malware on smartphones, attacks and defenses
against mobile devices, and authentication and privacy is-
sues of mobile users. We are especially pleased to have a
keynote speech by Jon Geator, Chief Technology Oﬃcer of
Trustonic. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a
valuable reference for security researchers and developers.
We put together a larger program committee this year,
and invited several mobile security experts from outside
North America to lend an international ﬂavor to the PC.
Every paper received at least three expert reviews. We like
to thank the PC members (listed below) for their dedication
and hard work for their timely reviews and active discussion.
