User: I have a python script that basically runs forever and checks a webpage every second and notifies me if any value changes. I placed it on an AWS EC2 instance and ran it through ssh. The script was running fine when I checked after half an hour or so after I started it. 
The problem is that after a few hours when I checked again, the ssh had closed. When I logged back in, there was no program running. I checked all running processes and nothing was running. 
Can anyone teach me how to make it run forever (or until I stop it) on AWS EC2 instances? Thanks a lot. 

Edit: I used the Java SSH Client provided by AWS to run the script
Assistant: You can run the program using the nohup command, so that even when the SSH session closes your program continues running.
Eg: nohup python yourscriptname.py &
For more info you can check the man page for it using
man nohup.
