Hi,  
I have a requirement that model should search for relevant documents before
answering the query. I found RAG from Facebook AI which perfectly aligns with
my requirement . Also saw this blog from HF and came to know that HF
implemented RAG which is awesome!
My doubt is whether I could extend HF's implementation of RAG so that the
model should retrieve documents from local directory rather than HF's
wikipedia corpus.  
Are there any notebooks to refer..?
