User: Please explain the common inter-process communication methods, including pipes, message queues, semaphores, etc.
Assistant: 1. Pipeline (pipe) Pipeline is a half-duplex communication method that can only be used between processes with a common ancestor. It is a special file that realizes one-way data transmission by reading and writing, and data flows from one end (output) to the other end (input). 2. Message queue (message queue) Message queue is a way to realize communication between unrelated processes. It is a message container stored in the kernel, and messages can be delivered on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. The sender puts the message at the end of the queue, and the receiver takes the message from the front of the queue. 3. Shared memory (shared memory) Shared memory is a memory sharing technology. It enables multiple processes to access the same piece of physical memory, thereby avoiding the overhead of data replication and greatly improving the efficiency of inter-process communication. Multiple processes can read and write the same memory area at the same time. 4. Semaphore (Semaphore) Semaphore is a common process synchronization and mutual exclusion mechanism. It is a counter used to record the number of processes that can simultaneously access a shared resource. When a process wants to access the resource, first execute the P operation to decrement the semaphore by 1. When the value of the semaphore is less than 0, the process is blocked; when a process finishes accessing the resource, execute the V operation to make Add 1 to the semaphore to wake up other blocked processes. 5. Socket (socket) Socket is a common communication mechanism, which can realize inter-process communication between different computers. It is a basis for network communication and can be used to implement client/server applications. Sockets can realize different communication methods such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many, and are flexible and highly cross-platform.
