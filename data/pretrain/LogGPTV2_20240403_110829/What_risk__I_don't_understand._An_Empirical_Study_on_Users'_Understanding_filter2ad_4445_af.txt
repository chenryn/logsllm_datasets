A FIGURES.
A.1 History analysis of technical terms.
We compare the empirical CDFs of the terms in 7 of our categories.
Since most of the terms in the general category are common and
ordinary, we use the CDF of the general category as the baseline. In
Fig.13, we show that the terms were first coined after the year 400,
and the number of the terms increase slowly until the year 1300.
The empirical CDFs in computer security technique/monitoring,
cryptography/authentication, and threat/attack are close to each
other, which indicates a similar history between the terms related to
‘security’ and ‘attack’. Besides, the figure shows that over 85% terms
in software/application and about 90% terms in protocol/standard
appeared after the invention of the first computer in 1946. Similarly,
there are rapid increases after 1946 for computer security tech-
nique/monitoring, cryptography/authentication, and threat/attack.
Since the first cyberattack happened in the 1980s, computer secu-
rity/attacks have received very high attention with exponential
growth in the types and number.
Except for the general category, the empirical CDF of the com-
munication/network is higher than the others. About 30% of the
terms in the communication/network category emerged before the
nineteenth century. That is because communication is an old con-
cept, and some terms (e.g., transmit, session, and route) have been
used since the middle ages. After a two-hundred-year stable phase,
the number of the terms in communication/network suddenly in-
creases following the first invention of the telephone, which is also
the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution.
