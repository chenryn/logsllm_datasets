is too much technical ....
While migrating the FormatterBundle to Symfony2.3, some small details can take
a bit longer to fix than expecting. There is one main issue with the Form
Component which makes it pretty impossible for a FormType to access the
different fields.
Let's explain how we try to avoid a BC break in the SonataFormatterBundle:
The Formatter Bundle provides a easy way to convert raw markup (markdow,
textile, ...) into a final state. The visual representation is
![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/43b630ad8ad2b7813b8b15e5f6a6bbca1295937674b9d66ae7194c6b06804ad5/687474703a2f2f736f6e6174612d70726f6a6563742e6f72672f62756e646c65732f666f726d61747465722f6d61737465722f646f632f5f696d616765732f666f726d61747465725f776974685f636b656469746f722e706e67)
In order to make it work a FormatterType is used. The type allows to define a
format (mardown, html, etc ...) to be applied on a target field by reading the
data from a source field. So if you have a Post entity, the entity will have :
  * a content field : the transformed field
  * a rawContent field : the source field
  * a contentFormatter field: the format field
As config->getInheritData()) {
            if (!$this->parent) {
                throw new RuntimeException('The form is configured to inherit its parent\'s data, but does not have a parent.');
            }
            return $this->parent->getData();
        }
        if (!$this->defaultDataSet) {
            $this->setData($this->config->getData());
        }
        return $this->modelData;
    }
After digging into the Form Component source code, the internal event
dispatcher is set per FormBuilder and while a FormType::buildForm is called,
the callee method does not copy the event dispatcher from the FormatterType
builder to the parent (when inherit_data is set to true). This can be the
expected behavior as inherited_data means "Sets whether the form should read
and write the data of its parent.", we can expect the event dispatcher being
shared. By looking at the code, this change is not as easy as it might look.
While a Form is being built by using the FormBuilder and the FormType the
options are not always available.
So in order to find a solution and keep going, we introduce a BC break in the
FormatterType.
The solution: pass the parent event dispatcher to the form type. This might
not be the best solution, but at least it will work as before and might break
on some edge cases (can someone point me to an edge case?)
The BC break and the fix: sonata-project/SonataFormatterBundle@`2d1a412`
