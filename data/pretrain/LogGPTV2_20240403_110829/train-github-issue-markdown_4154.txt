## Expected Behavior
When developing an app, with or without a third-party server (`express`, for
instance), the app should reload without "clearing" the terminal. When
starting with `next dev --preserve-log`, the log should not be obscured. This
option should also be available when starting programmatically with `const app
= next({ dev, preserveLog: true });`.
## Current Behavior
The log scrolls offscreen every time the app rebuilds.
## Context
I will often start troubleshooting code with `console.log`. Having to take my
hands off the keyboard to scroll back through the logs slows me down and
breaks my flow.
