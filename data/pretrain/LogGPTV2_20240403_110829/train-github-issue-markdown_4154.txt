### Issue Report: Terminal Log Preservation During App Rebuilds

#### Search Verification
I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and am confident that this issue has not been previously reported.

#### Expected Behavior
When developing an application, whether or not a third-party server (e.g., `express`) is used, the app should reload without clearing the terminal. Specifically, when using the `next dev --preserve-log` command, the terminal log should remain visible and not be obscured. This functionality should also be available when starting the application programmatically, for example, with `const app = next({ dev: true, preserveLog: true });`.

#### Current Behavior
Currently, every time the application rebuilds, the log scrolls off the screen, making it difficult to track previous output.

#### Context
During development, I frequently use `console.log` statements to debug and troubleshoot code. Having to manually scroll back through the logs each time the app rebuilds disrupts my workflow and slows down the debugging process.

#### Environment
- **Next.js Version:** v4.1.1
- **Node.js Version:** v8.7.0
- **Operating System:** macOS 10.13

This enhancement would significantly improve the developer experience by maintaining a persistent and readable log during the development process.
