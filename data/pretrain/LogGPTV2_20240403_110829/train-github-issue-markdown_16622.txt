### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
We have a number of node14 projects that we are in the process of upgrading to
16 (and if we aren't careful, the LTS train will have moved on before we get
there!).
Can anyone explain what has changed in npm 8(?), that could cause git+ssh
dependencies to fail? I have a (fairly) minimal repro here, but almost no
theory as to what could cause it. I don't know if it is related to docker, or
npm, or some combination of the two.

    executor failed running [/bin/sh -c npm i]: exit code: 128
    make: *** [Makefile:7: build] Error 1
I have a workaround, to move the `chown` after `npm i`, but that takes my
build time from ~1 min to ~12 mins. which isn't ideal.
### Expected Behavior
I would expect it to work the same as npm6
### Steps To Reproduce
see above
### Environment
