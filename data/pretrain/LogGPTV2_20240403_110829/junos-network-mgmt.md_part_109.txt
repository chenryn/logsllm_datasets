### Configuring TLS Syslog Protocol

To configure the TLS syslog protocol, follow the steps below. These instructions require navigating through various levels in the configuration hierarchy. For more detailed guidance on using the CLI editor in configuration mode, refer to the *Using the CLI Editor in Configuration Mode* section in the CLI User Guide.

#### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Set the Log Mode to Stream:**
   - Navigate to the `[edit security]` hierarchy.
   - Enter the following command:
     ```shell
     user@host# set log mode stream
     ```

2. **Specify the Structured System Log (sd-syslog) Format:**
   - Ensure you are still in the `[edit security]` hierarchy.
   - Enter the following command:
     ```shell
     user@host# set log format sd-syslog
     ```

3. **Set the Source Interface:**
   - Still in the `[edit security]` hierarchy, enter:
     ```shell
     user@host# set log source-interface ge-0/0/1.0
     ```

4. **Specify TLS as the Security Log Transport Protocol:**
   - In the `[edit security]` hierarchy, enter:
     ```shell
     user@host# set log transport protocol tls
     ```

5. **Specify the TLS Profile Name:**
   - In the `[edit security]` hierarchy, enter:
     ```shell
     user@host# set log transport tls-profile ssl-i-tls
     ```

6. **Configure the Log Stream for Server 1:**
   - In the `[edit security]` hierarchy, enter:
     ```shell
     user@host# set log stream server1 format sd-syslog
     ```

7. **Set the Logging Category for Server 1:**
   - In the `[edit security]` hierarchy, enter:
     ```shell
     user@host# set log stream server1 category all
     ```

8. **Specify the Server Host Parameters:**
   - In the `[edit security]` hierarchy, enter:
     ```shell
     user@host# set log stream server1 host 192.0.2.100
     ```

9. **Define the Protocol Version for the SSL Initiation Access Profile:**
   - Navigate to the `[edit services]` hierarchy.
   - Enter the following command:
     ```shell
     user@host# set ssl initiation profile ssl-i-tls protocol-version all
     ```

10. **Attach All CA Profile Groups to the SSL Initiation Profile:**
    - In the `[edit services]` hierarchy, enter:
      ```shell
      user@host# set ssl initiation profile ssl-i-tls trusted-ca all
      ```

11. **Configure the SSL Initiation Access Profile to Ignore Server Authentication Failures:**
    - In the `[edit services]` hierarchy, enter:
      ```shell
      user@host# set ssl initiation profile ssl-i-tls actions ignore-server-auth-failure
      ```

#### Verification

After completing the configuration, verify it by using the `show security log` and `show configuration services ssl initiation` commands. If the output does not match the intended configuration, repeat the steps to correct it.

- **Verify Security Log Configuration:**
  ```shell
  [edit]
  user@host# show security log
  ```

  Expected Output:
  ```shell
  mode stream;
  format sd-syslog;
  source-interface ge-0/0/1.0;
  transport {
      protocol tls;
      tls-profile ssl-i-tls;
  }
  stream server1 {
      format sd-syslog;
      category all;
      host 192.0.2.100;
  }
  ```

- **Verify SSL Initiation Profile Configuration:**
  ```shell
  [edit]
  user@host# show configuration services ssl initiation
  ```

  Expected Output:
  ```shell
  profile ssl-i-tls {
      protocol-version all;
      trusted-ca all;
      actions {
          ignore-server-auth-failure;
      }
  }
  ```

If the configuration is verified and correct, commit the changes from configuration mode:
```shell
[edit]
user@host# commit
```

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

#### Monitor System Log Messages

**Purpose:**
Display system log messages to investigate issues with interfaces on the switch.

**Action:**
Use the `show log messages` command to view system log messages:
```shell
user@switch1> show log messages
```

**Sample Output:**
```shell
Nov 4 11:30:01 switch1 newsyslog[2283]: logfile turned over due to size>128K
Nov 4 11:30:01 switch1 newsyslog[2283]: logfile turned over due to size>128K
Nov 4 11:30:06 switch1 chassism[952]: CM ENV Monitor: set fan speed is 65 percent for Fan 1
...
Nov 4 12:10:24 switch1 mgd[2293]: UI_CMDLINE_READ_LINE: User 'jsmith', command 'exit '
```

**Meaning:**
- A new log file was created when the previous file reached 128 KB.
- The fan speed for Fans 1, 2, and 3 is set at 65%.
- Health monitoring activity is detected.
- CLI commands were entered by the user `jsmith`.

#### Ping Hosts

**Purpose:**
Verify network connectivity to a host using the `ping` command.

**Action:**
Send four ping requests to `host3`:
```shell
user@switch> ping host3 count 4
```

**Sample Output:**
```shell
PING host3.site.net (192.0.2.111): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.0.2.111: icmp_seq=0 ttl=122 time=0.661 ms
...
--- host3.site.net ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.619/0.634/0.661/0.017 ms
```

**Meaning:**
- Size of the ping response packet.
- IP address of the responding host.
- Sequence number of the ping response.
- Time-to-live (TTL) value.
- Round-trip time in milliseconds.
- Number of packets sent and received.
- Packet loss percentage.
- Round-trip time statistics (min, avg, max, stddev).

#### Monitor Traffic Through the Router or Switch

**Purpose:**
Display real-time statistics about traffic passing through all interfaces on the router or switch.

**Action:**
Use the `monitor interface traffic` command:
```shell
user@host> monitor interface traffic
```

**Sample Output:**
```shell
host name Seconds: 15 Time: 12:31:09
Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps)
so-1/0/0 Down 0 (0) 0 (0)
so-2/0/0 Up 211035 (1) 36778 (0)
...
Bytes=b, Clear=c, Delta=d, Packets=p, Quit=q or ESC, Rate=r, Up=^U, Down=^D
```

**Meaning:**
- Displays traffic data for active interfaces.
- Shows the amount that each field has changed since the command started or since the counters were cleared.

**Monitor Traffic for a Specific Interface:**

**Action:**
Use the `monitor interface <interface-name>` command:
```shell
user@host> monitor interface so-0/0/1
```

**Sample Output:**
```shell
Interface: so-0/0/1, Enabled, Link is Up
Encapsulation: PPP, Keepalives, Speed: OC3
Traffic statistics:
Input bytes: 5856541 (88 bps)
Output bytes: 6271468 (96 bps)
Input packets: 157629 (0 pps)
Output packets: 157024 (0 pps)
...
```

**Meaning:**
- Displays input and output packets for the specified interface.
- Includes common interface failures and error conditions.

**Output Control Keys:**
- `N`: Display information about the next interface.
- `I`: Display information about a different interface.
- `F`: Freeze the display.
- `T`: Thaw the display.
- `C`: Clear delta counters.
- `Q`: Stop the command.

### Dynamic Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) Overview

**Applications Using Dynamic TCAM Infrastructure:**
- **Firewall Filter:** All firewall configurations.
- **Implicit Filter:** RE demons using filters for functionality (e.g., connectivity fault management, IP MAC validation).
- **Dynamic Filters:** Applications using filters at the PFE level (e.g., logical interface level fixed classifier, RFC 2544).
- **System-Init Filters:** Filters required at the system level or during boot (e.g., Layer 2 and Layer 3 control protocol trap, default ARP policer).

**Features Using TCAM Resource:**
- **inet-firewall, bridge-firewall, connectivity fault management, link fault management, etc.**

**Monitoring TCAM Resource Usage:**
- Use the appropriate CLI commands to monitor and troubleshoot TCAM resource usage.

**Example: Monitoring and Troubleshooting TCAM Resource:**
- Follow the specific steps and commands provided in the documentation to monitor and troubleshoot TCAM resource usage.

**Service Scaling on ACX Series Routers:**
- Understand the dynamic allocation of TCAM resources to achieve higher service scaling based on application demand.
