**Title: TiYunZong: An Exploit Chain for Remotely Rooting Modern Android Devices (2015-2020)**

As more security mitigations have been introduced into Android, modern devices have become increasingly difficult to root, especially remotely. This is particularly true for Google's Pixel devices, which receive the latest updates and security patches. In this presentation, we will explore why Pixel devices are challenging targets and provide an analysis of the attack surface for remotely compromising Android.

We will introduce an exploit chain, named TiYunZong, which can be used to remotely root a wide range of Qualcomm-based Android devices, including Pixel devices. The exploit chain leverages three newly discovered vulnerabilities: CVE-2019-5870, CVE-2019-5877, and CVE-2019-10567. We will also present an effective and stable method for chaining these vulnerabilities for exploitation without relying on Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), despite ROP being the most common technique for exploiting complex vulnerabilities.

TiYunZong is the first reported one-click remote root exploit chain for Pixel devices and has earned the highest reward in any Google Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) for a single exploit chain.
