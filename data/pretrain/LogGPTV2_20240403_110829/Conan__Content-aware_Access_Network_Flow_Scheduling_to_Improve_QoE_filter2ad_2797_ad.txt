To evaluate the impact of storage size on average hit ratio and average transmission delay, simulations were conducted with varying storage sizes. The parameters used in the simulations are as follows: the number of F-APs (M) is 5, the number of MUs (K) is 10, and the dwell time of each MU (τu) is 10 slots. The storage size (N) was varied from 5 to 25. 

**Figure 6** shows the average hit ratios of different caching policies for varying storage sizes. As the storage size increases, the average hit ratios for all caching policies also increase. For each storage size, the proposed caching policy consistently achieves a higher hit ratio compared to other policies.

**Figure 7** illustrates the average transmission delays of different caching policies for varying storage sizes. As the storage size expands, the average transmission delays for all caching policies decrease. The proposed caching policy outperforms other policies, achieving lower average transmission delays. This is because a larger storage capacity allows more requested content to be stored locally, reducing the need to fetch content from remote servers.

The influence of the number of MUs on the average hit ratio and average transmission delay was also investigated. The simulation results are depicted in **Figures 8 and 9**. The parameters used in these simulations are: M = 5, N = 15, τu = 10, and K varies from 5 to 25.

**Figure 8** shows that as the number of MUs increases, the average hit ratios of all caching policies gradually decrease. However, the proposed caching policy still maintains a higher hit ratio compared to other policies for each value of K.

**Figure 9** indicates that as the number of MUs increases, the average transmission delays for all caching policies rise. The proposed caching policy, however, consistently achieves lower average transmission delays compared to other policies. This is due to the fact that as the number of MUs increases, the variety of requested content also increases, leading to a decrease in the number of cache hits if the storage size remains constant.

It is important to note that the dwell times of different MUs are set to the same value in **Figures 6-9**. In reality, the dwell times of different MUs may vary due to their random behaviors. To simulate this, **Figures 10 and 11** show the average hit ratios and average transmission delays for varying storage sizes, with different dwell times for MUs. The dwell times for 10 MUs were set to {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100} slots. Despite the unpredictable user mobility, the dueling DQN-based caching policy still performs well, providing superior average hit ratios and lower average transmission delays compared to traditional policies.

### Conclusions
- As the storage size increases, the average hit ratios of caching policies increase, while the average transmission delays decrease.
- As the number of MUs increases, the average hit ratios of caching policies decrease, while the average transmission delays increase.

### Summary
- The proposed caching policy can effectively operate in various scenarios with different storage sizes, user densities, and mobility patterns.
- The proposed policy outperforms traditional caching policies (FIFO, LRU, LFU) in terms of both average hit ratio and average transmission delay.
- Even with denser MU populations and arbitrary, ruleless movements, the proposed policy demonstrates superior performance.

### Future Work
- Investigate a radio resource-efficient cache update policy to better utilize time-varying and diverse user demands.
