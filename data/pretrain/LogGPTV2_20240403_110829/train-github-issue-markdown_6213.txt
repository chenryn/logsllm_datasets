### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Currently the GeneralizedLinearRegressor module only allows a scalar `alpha`
regularization parameter to be used for all parameters. However, sometimes the
modeler would like to input different amounts of regularization on certain
parameters, either for interpretation or some other prior knowledge.
### Describe your proposed solution
The alpha parameter can take either a scalar value or an iterable of the same
length as the number of parameters in the input matrix.
The optimization algorithm will then flow as normal with the line below in
glm.py naturally doing a vector to vector dot product instead of a scalar
vector multiplication.
    coef_scaled = alpha * coef[offset:]
I believe the alpha parameter passed to `scipy.optimize.minimize` in the
`args` parameter isn't being used anywhere.
For QA, I plan to output regression results in R or statsmodels for the same
data and model specs

### Additional context
I modified this as part of my dayjob and also doing this as part of my
programming work at my university. This is my first PR so please let me know
if I'm missing anything.
