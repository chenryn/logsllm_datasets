Cast renders an anonymous alias contrary to the documentation
The example used in the documantation
    from sqlalchemy import cast, Numeric, select
    stmt = select([
                cast(product_table.c.unit_price, Numeric(10, 4))
            ])
renders as
    SELECT CAST(product_table.unit_price AS NUMERIC(10, 4)) AS anon_1 FROM product_table
instead of
    SELECT CAST(unit_price AS NUMERIC(10, 4)) FROM product
I've tried sqlalchemy version 1.2.7 and 1.2.16 and both return the same result
