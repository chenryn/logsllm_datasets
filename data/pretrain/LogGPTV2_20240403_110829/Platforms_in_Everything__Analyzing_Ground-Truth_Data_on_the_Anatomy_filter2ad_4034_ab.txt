IP addresses, ﬁnancial transactions, and type of payment in-
struments used and available over time.
Communications between MaxiDed operators, customers,
merchants, and upstream providers were captured as CRM
system tickets. Ticket contents and email communications
also include instances of abuse complaint emails that MaxiDed
administrators received and forwarded to their customers. We
should note that the operators also operated a live-chat chan-
nel for customers on the site. They were also known to use
ICQ, Jabber and Skype contact channels at some point in
time. These communications were not stored on the seized
servers, if they were stored at all. Communications data, often
the most sensitive, have not been analyzed in favor of the
ethical principles that we followed.
Overall, the retrieved data represents information over the
course of MaxiDed’s life span from Jan.- 2011 to May-2018,
when its operation was disrupted. High level statistics and
descriptions of the ground-truth data is presented in Table 2.
To enrich the ground-truth data, we deployed several addi-
tional data sources. Domain-based resources operating from
the customer IPs, were identiﬁed using historical passive DNS
data collected via Farsight Security’s (DNSDB [18]). To iden-
tify upstream providers of servers and IPs, we used historical
WHOIS IP allocation data from Maxmind [19]. A set of do-
main and IP-based blacklists have been used to gain further
insights into abuse emanating from customer servers.
5 Data Integrity
Since we did not gather the information ourselves, we need
to evaluate its accuracy and authenticity: how do we know
that MaxiDed admins did not manipulate data, for reasons of
operational security or otherwise?
Our data resulted from the legal seizure of servers, in close
coordination with apprehension of two individuals who had

administrative control over these systems. This ensured that
the data was not manipulated during or after the seizure. To en-
sure that data was not manipulated in the course of MaxiDed’s
operation, we have examined data integrity in several ways.
We ﬁrst discuss the correspondence of the seized data with
external (third-party) data. Next, we analyze the internal con-
sistency of the seized data itself.
The strongest indicator of integrity is that the seized server
data was consistent with the data that was collected via legal
intercept prior to the takedown. A wiretap had been running
for over two years on the backend CRM server.
We also compared the data to snapshots of MaxiDed’s web-
shop archives on Internet Archive between 2015-2018. We
extracted all server package IDs that were on offer. All these
IDs were present in our back-end data as well.
For a sample of over 50 server packages on sale in April
2018, we compared the internally recorded price with the
prices of the entities listed as the upstream providers. These
included packages from a Dutch and a German upstream
hosting provider. For each package, we visited the supplier’s
website, customized a server package to match, and found its
price to be correctly reﬂected by the internal price.
For the payment data, we were able to compare the
WebMoney transactions logged in the database with data that
was subpoenaed by Dutch law enforcement from WebMoney
on transactions during a period of 10 days involving one par-
ticular WebMoney wallet address. Of 31 internally recorded
transactions during this period via WebMoney, 17 were
matched with the external data.
Together, these external checks provide conﬁdence that the
internal data has not been manipulated. Multiple internal data
consistency checks were also carried out. We cross referenced
customer order placements against server package data, to
determine if all order placements consistently point to an
existing package. Of the 14,702 customer orders for servers,
we found 431 referencing package IDs that were not listed,
indicating a 2.9% proportion of inconsistent order placement
records. These references point to a set of 306 unique server
packages (a 0.5% proportion of all server packages).
We also cross referenced MaxiDed operators’ payments to
their merchants, against server package data. These indirectly
referenced speciﬁc server packages, thereby indicating what
each payment is for. Of the 33,124 outgoing payments, we
found 345 referencing packages that were not listed among
the set of offered server packages (a 1.0% proportion of in-
consistent payment records). Cross referencing the same pay-
ment data against customer orders, we found 474 outgoing
payments referencing servers that were not listed among the
orders of customers (a 1.5% of inconsistent payment records).
The timestamps of order placement and transactions were
also analyzed, to check for suspicious gaps in the timeline.
The longest gap was observed to be 76 days from 2011-03-
31 to 2011-06-15. All remaining gaps (37) were at most 2
days long. Approximately an average number of 26 order
placements per day were observed. For payment events, the
longest timeline gap was observed to be 135 days pertaining
to the data from the period between 2011-01-29 and 2011-06-
13. The remaining gaps (5) were no longer than 1 day. An
average number of 24 transactions per day were observed in
the payment data.
The minor inconsistencies and timeline gaps for the most
part relate to records from 2011 and 2012, a period cor-
responding to the initial set up and early growth phase of
MaxiDed. A certain amount of inconsistency in database
records is to be expected, but more so during the initial set up
and growth phase of any organization. All in all, the internal
and external consistency of the data merits conﬁdence in its
validity for the purposes of characterizing the overall anatomy
and economics of MaxiDed ’s BPH operation.
6 Anatomy of MaxiDed ’s business
Figure 1: MaxiDed in a glance.
Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of MaxiDed ’s
anatomy and business model. We take a close look at each of
its components.
6.1 Hosting Business Components
(Marketplace) MaxiDed was a marketplace which connected
merchants offering server packages that allowed abuse, with

a ﬁxed 20% fee from each sale between a merchant and a
customer. Customers did not see the merchants’ identities or
even that an offer came from a separate entity. All they knew
was that they contracted with MaxiDed. The merchants adver-
tised server packages from legitimate upstream providers and
put these on the MaxiDed market with a markup. Server pack-
ages speciﬁed default server conﬁgurations that were further
customizable by customers. In addition to the technical spec-
iﬁcation, each package indicated what type of abuse, if any,
was allowed. The majority of the packages explicitly allowed
certain forms of abuse. MaxiDed itself also put server pack-
ages from certain upstream providers for sale in the webshop,
de facto operating as merchant on its own platform. For its
own packages, proﬁts varied between 0 to 40% of the cost of
packages at the upstream providers. What’s more, MaxiDed
also operated as a customer on its own platform, acquiring of-
fers from merchants for its side business, a highly permissive
and lucrative ﬁle sharing service called DepFile. This ﬁle
sharing service was a major hub for distributing child sexual
abuse material.
The platform approach means MaxiDed can externalize the
cost and risks of acquiring and supplying upstream server
infrastructure to third-party merchants. As such it is decou-
pled from the upstreams. The advantage for merchants, on
the other hand, was that they could externalize the responsi-
bility and risks of acquiring customers and processing their
payments. Beside the fee that MaxiDed charged on top of the
merchant’s price, it also charged customers for performing
additional administrative tasks, like re-installing servers af-
ter a takedown by the upstream provider. From these fees, it
needed to recoup the cost of its staff and backend systems.
The main components of the marketplace were a fron-
tend webshop, a backend Customer Relationship Manage-
ment (CRM) system, accounts for merchants who could offer
server packages on in the webshop, and payment handling
of customers paying to MaxiDed and, in turn, MaxiDed pay-
ing the merchants when their offers resulted in a sale. The
CRM, a series of webpages implemented in PHP, was used
by both MaxiDed and merchants to create the server pack-
ages displayed on the webshop. It was also used to facilitate
communications between customers and merchants through
customer tickets. Merchants were responsible for handling
customer tickets of their own server packages. Communi-
cations also took place through multiple MaxiDed support
email addresses which were automatically imported into the
backend database and live-chat functionality which was not
retrievable from our data.
Different payment options have been supported over time
by MaxiDed; 23 in total. Some from third-party payment
providers like Paypal and WebMoney to cryptocurrencies
such as Bitcoin and Zcash.
(Merchants) Third-party merchants supplied server pack-
ages that were re-branded and sold, with a mark-up, un-
der MaxiDed’s name. Many offered packages were directly
scraped by the merchants from retail auction sites run by
certain upstream providers. As far as we could tell, most
merchants had no established reseller relationship with the up-
stream provider and no delegation was visible in IP WHOIS.
(We explore this more systematically in S.7.3.) This inval-
idates a key assumption in prior work, i.e., that agile BPH
providers operate on the basis of established reseller relation-
ships that are visible in sub-allocations. In some cases, mer-
chants did establish reseller relationships with an upstream
provider. This allowed them to hook into an API and automate
the importing and advertising process of upstream packages,
rather than having to manually scrape other hosting provider’s
websites, in addition to receive certain discounts.
(Upstream Providers) These are legitimate hosting com-
panies that offer server packages, via retail channels, auctions
or reseller programs, which are put into the MaxiDed market-
place by the merchants. Once sold, the merchant acquires
the package from the upstream provider. In S.7.3, we use
WHOIS IP allocation information to infer from which up-
stream providers the merchants bought their packages.
(Customers) Customers were elicited for their preferences
and guided towards server packages upon visiting MaxiDed’s
webshop. This occurred via standard search ﬁlters or via live
chat with administrators. Customers were able to request more
powerful hardware, additional IP addresses, pre-installation
of a speciﬁc OS, and decide on the physical location of the
servers. Figure 15 (see S.14 Appendix-A) provides an excerpt
of a live chat conducted by one of the authors with MaxiDed
operators prior to its takedown demonstrating this process.
Customers would ﬁrst deposit funds into a USD denomi-
nated “wallet” and then use these wallet funds to pay for the
invoices that MaxiDed issued to them. In other words, pur-
chases were prepaid. This structure allows merchants to place
orders only after receiving payments and to shift the risks
of premature contract termination to customers as they have
received payments in full. Customers were not reimbursed for
lost server-day usage due to premature service suspension at
the upstream.
6.2 Side Business
MaxiDed’s administrators also operated a ﬁle sharing plat-
form, known as DepFile [13, 20], run on servers which
they rented through the MaxiDed marketplace. Some of these
servers were also seized during the law enforcement action.
Data shows that DepFile infrastructure was acquired using
a single MaxiDed customer account which never paid its in-
voices. Over time, the account accrued approximately 400,000
USD in debt. DepFile allowed its customers to host and
access content, some of which included child sexual abuse
material, on a monthly subscription basis. Our separate anal-
ysis of internal DepFile data, suggest that it resembled a so
called “afﬁliate program” [15, 21, 22] with afﬁliates bring-
ing in new subscribers. The proﬁts from subsequent sign-ups

were shared between DepFile (a.k.a. MaxiDed) and the afﬁli-
ates. As an aside: these proﬁts were much higher than those
of MaxiDed. One could argue that the MaxiDed was more
valuable to its owners as a way to acquire cheap and risk-free
server infrastructure than as its own proﬁt model.
6.3 Examples of Bullet-Proof Behavior
Figure 2a shows a screenshot of one of MaxiDed’s publicly
advertised server packages along with descriptions of its loca-
tion, network/IP-address information, price, in addition to ex-
plicit descriptions of abusive activities that were (dis-)allowed
upon purchasing. Figure 2b illustrates a conversation (lightly
edited for spelling) that took place between an admin and a
customer in the context of a CRM ticket. XRumer is a tool
aimed at boosting search engine rankings by auto-registering
accounts and posting link spam. It demonstrates that MaxiDed
operators were not only explicitly tolerating abuse, but that
they were informed about the abusive activities of their cus-
tomers and actively supported them. This is also the case for
DepFile. It knows the ﬁle sharing service is supporting illegal
content, including child sexual abuse material. The customer
interaction also shows the admin ignoring abuse complaints,
then assisting the customer by migrating resources to a dif-
ferent network location. Figure 2c is another example of a
(lightly-edited) conversation excerpt, demonstrating that cer-
tain customers were asked to pay an ‘abuse fee’ to continue
accessing their rented server upon receiving abuse complaints.
7 Supply and Demand for BPH
MaxiDed’s operations deviate from certain assumptions un-
derlying recent detection techniques. This warrants a more
detailed analysis of its characteristics to understand if this
new form of agile BPH exhibits chokepoints that allow for
disruption. Most disruption strategies rely either on taking
down the provider as a whole or on cutting off the supply of
resources that it needs: servers, connectivity, payment instru-
ments, customers. In MaxiDed’s case, the former occurred.
These kinds of takedowns however, are rare and hard to scale.
This section explores the alternative strategy: squeezing po-
tential chokepoints in the supply chain.
7.1 Merchants
In a period of seven years, merchants offered 56,113 different
server packages. Around a quarter of all packages (14,931)
explicitly allowed certain kinds of abuse. We refer to these as
bullet-proof (BP) packages. Note that non-BP packages were
also abused, as we learned from customer tickets when servers
were suspended. Admins frowned on this practice. Not be-
cause of the abuse itself, but because these customers should
have purchased a more expensive abuse-allowing package.
