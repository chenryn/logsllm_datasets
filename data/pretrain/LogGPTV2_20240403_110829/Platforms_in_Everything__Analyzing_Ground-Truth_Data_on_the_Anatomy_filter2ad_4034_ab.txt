### IP Addresses, Financial Transactions, and Payment Instruments

The dataset includes IP addresses, financial transactions, and the types of payment instruments used and available over time. Communications between MaxiDed operators, customers, merchants, and upstream providers were captured as CRM system tickets. These tickets and email communications also included instances of abuse complaint emails that MaxiDed administrators received and forwarded to their customers. Additionally, the operators provided a live-chat channel for customers on the site and were known to use ICQ, Jabber, and Skype at various points in time. However, these communications were not stored on the seized servers, if they were stored at all. For ethical reasons, the most sensitive communication data was not analyzed.

### Data Timeline and Enrichment

The retrieved data spans MaxiDed’s operational period from January 2011 to May 2018. High-level statistics and descriptions of the ground-truth data are presented in Table 2. To enrich this data, we utilized several additional sources. Historical passive DNS data from Farsight Security’s DNSDB [18] was used to identify domain-based resources operating from customer IPs. Historical WHOIS IP allocation data from Maxmind [19] was employed to identify upstream providers of servers and IPs. We also used domain and IP-based blacklists to gain further insights into abuse emanating from customer servers.

### Data Integrity

Since we did not gather the information ourselves, it was essential to evaluate its accuracy and authenticity. The data was obtained through the legal seizure of servers, coordinated with the apprehension of two individuals who had administrative control over these systems. This ensured that the data was not manipulated during or after the seizure. We examined data integrity in several ways, including correspondence with external (third-party) data and internal consistency.

#### External Consistency Checks
- **Legal Intercept Data**: The seized server data was consistent with data collected via legal intercept prior to the takedown.
- **Webshop Archives**: Data was compared with snapshots of MaxiDed’s web-shop archives on the Internet Archive between 2015-2018.
- **Price Verification**: For a sample of over 50 server packages on sale in April 2018, the internally recorded prices were verified against the prices listed by the upstream providers.
- **Payment Data**: WebMoney transactions logged in the database were compared with data subpoenaed by Dutch law enforcement from WebMoney.

#### Internal Consistency Checks
- **Order Placement**: Of the 14,702 customer orders for servers, 431 referenced package IDs that were not listed, indicating a 2.9% inconsistency.
- **Payments to Merchants**: Of the 33,124 outgoing payments, 345 referenced packages that were not listed, indicating a 1.0% inconsistency.
- **Timestamp Analysis**: The longest gap in order placement was 76 days, and the longest gap in payment events was 135 days, primarily occurring in 2011 and 2012.

### Anatomy of MaxiDed’s Business

Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of MaxiDed’s anatomy and business model. We will examine each component in detail.

#### Hosting Business Components
- **Marketplace**: MaxiDed functioned as a marketplace connecting merchants offering server packages that allowed abuse with customers seeking an abuse-tolerant provider. It charged a fixed 20% fee from each sale.
- **Merchants**: Third-party merchants supplied server packages, often scraped from retail auction sites run by upstream providers, and sold them under MaxiDed’s name with a markup.
- **Upstream Providers**: Legitimate hosting companies offered server packages, which were then put into the MaxiDed marketplace by the merchants.
- **Customers**: Customers could request customized server configurations and pre-installation of specific OSs. They deposited funds into a USD-denominated wallet to pay for invoices, shifting the risk of premature contract termination to them.

#### Side Business
MaxiDed’s administrators also operated a file-sharing platform called DepFile, which was a major hub for distributing child sexual abuse material. DepFile infrastructure was acquired using a single MaxiDed customer account, accruing approximately $400,000 in debt.

#### Examples of Bullet-Proof Behavior
Figure 2 illustrates examples of MaxiDed’s bullet-proof behavior, including explicit tolerance of abusive activities and support for customers involved in such activities.

### Supply and Demand for BPH

MaxiDed’s operations deviate from certain assumptions underlying recent detection techniques. This section explores potential chokepoints in the supply chain, such as merchants, upstream providers, and payment instruments, to understand if this new form of agile BPH can be disrupted.

#### Merchants
In seven years, merchants offered 56,113 different server packages, with around a quarter (14,931) explicitly allowing certain kinds of abuse. Non-BP packages were also abused, but admins frowned on this practice because customers should have purchased more expensive abuse-allowing packages.
