From its academic inception in 1969 to its current status as a global digital network interconnecting most of humanity and facilitating nearly all commerce, the Internet has experienced explosive growth. As an innovation platform, the Internet is unparalleled in human history for the value it has created and the tools it has made available to people worldwide. The level of freedom afforded to innovators on the Internet is unprecedented—virtually any individual or team can test almost any idea, with a built-in global audience and potentially an immediate global market.

However, this rapid growth and innovative value creation come at a cost. Much of the software running on our connected devices has been widely distributed and often forgotten by its creators, without undergoing rigorous "red team" testing to identify vulnerabilities. The challenge for the Internet is that today, there is more assurance that a UL-listed toaster oven will not burn down a house than there is that many of our more expensive and powerful Internet-connected devices are secure against becoming tools for online criminals.

The economics of this situation are also challenging. In the fast-paced, high-growth, Internet-driven economy, success is characterized by short time-to-market, low costs, and high volume. Innovators may not always have the time or resources to address potential security issues, leading to a culture of "patching it later." For example, during the preparation of these remarks, I read news reports about an Internet-enabled light bulb, part of the "Internet of Things," that was found to be vulnerable to a simple attack, exposing the local wireless network password to anyone who asked. It is highly unlikely that these flawed light bulbs can be patched, or that their owners will be informed of the need to return the product for a refund or exchange. Thus, while the world benefits from the Internet's economic and innovative powers, the cost is that millions of connected devices can easily become tools for criminals. Some companies are addressing this issue, but much work remains.

The pace of innovation and adaptation on the Internet is matched by the pace of innovation and adaptation by criminal botnet operators. Once a software flaw is discovered and publicized, it is quickly exploited for criminal purposes. The first step is to use the flaw to install software that allows the new computer to be managed as part of a botnet. Subsequent steps include installing specific tools to facilitate various types of online crime, such as DDoS attacks, spamming, keylogging, credential theft, or identity theft. The primary role of each member of a botnet is to find and infect more victims. Consequently, virtually all software flaws are exploited indirectly, using other infected computers. Criminals can operate through multiple layers of proxies and intermediaries, making it nearly impossible to trace most criminal acts back to their perpetrators. Therefore, it is safe to say that (1) most Internet crime relies on botnets, and (2) botnets depend on a continuous stream of software flaws in Internet-connected devices.

This is not a call for regulatory intervention. The Internet's success has come organically, without a central plan. No national government or international body should attempt to regulate the Internet. Instead, we must recognize the long-invisible costs and make informed decisions as a society on which costs we should accept and which are too high, necessitating cheaper alternatives. The primary ways to lower these costs are the same as in any other field: (1) understand the situation, (2) make informed choices, and (3) invest where it will reduce long-term costs.

Finally, I would like to quote a 2002 report from the ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC):

"With the advent of high-speed 'always on' connections, these PCs add up to either an enormous global threat, or a bonanza of freely retargetable resources, depending upon one's point of view."

Unfortunately, the major trend over the past twelve years has been growth—more Internet-connected devices, more software flaws, more botnets, and more crime.

### Steps for the Future

Next, I will describe some practical and effective next steps we can take toward short and medium-term goals. I believe we can achieve the most significant impact by addressing the causes, enablers, and attractions of botnets, rather than just improving our ability to take them down.

Awareness campaigns have played a crucial role in slowing the spread of human diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV. Given the danger that an unpatched and undefended Internet-connected device poses to the global economy and to the privacy and safety of its owner and others, why should we do less to stop the spread of botnets? I hope to see a day when every Internet user knows that if their device is out of date and slow, it is likely infected with malicious software that can steal their identity, send spam, and participate in DDoS attacks.

The U.S. Government is one of the world's largest buyers of Information Technology (IT). Any technical requirement that becomes part of the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) stands a good chance of becoming a de-facto standard globally. Since DDoS attacks often rely on the lack of Source Address Validation (SAV) by ISPs, perhaps we should consider requiring SAV by a specific date for all ISPs and hosting or cloud service providers who wish to sell services to the U.S. Government.

Ensuring the security of critical infrastructure is a high priority for both government and industry. It may be useful to form a blue-ribbon committee to identify and recommend best practices for securing network and server architecture, especially for industrial control systems. Some of the Conficker-infected computers we tracked in 2008 and 2009 turned out to be industrial controllers for medical equipment, including life/safety monitors used in surgical operating theatres. While there may be complexities involved in patching these embedded computers without triggering full recertification, it is clear that these computers should not be connected to the open Internet. We need to find more ways to front-load security protections into Internet-connected services and offerings. To this end, the government should continue to support and encourage industry-led groups like M3AAWG, which publishes reports and develops voluntary practices aimed at strengthening and facilitating botnet detection and remediation, and public/private partnerships like NCFTA.

### Conclusion

I have provided a brief overview of the botnet problem, its causes, its impact, and its likely future if we allow nature to take its course. I leave you with the following thoughts:

1. The Internet is the greatest invention in recorded history, in terms of its positive impact on human health, education, freedom, and national economies.
2. We have cut corners on device and software safety and quality to innovate at breakneck speed from 1969 to now—time-to-market, not resistance to takeover, has often been our overriding engineering principle.
3. The Internet is also the greatest invention in recorded history in terms of its negative impact on human privacy and freedom, as evidenced by the massive and continuing illicit transfer of wealth from productive people and countries to unproductive ones.
4. Our democratic commitment to the rule of law has little traction on the Internet compared to how it works in the real world. The Internet is borderless and lawless, yet it carries more of the world's commerce each year.
5. These problems manifest as "botnets," which are networks of robots using our connected devices in ways we never agreed to.
6. Takedown of criminal infrastructure, including botnets, must be approached not just as a reactive measure but also as a preventive strategy by addressing the underlying causes.
7. Takedown is not the responsibility of a single agency or company; cooperation and multilateralism must guide our efforts.
8. The U.S. Department of Justice is a model for its approach to takedown and its awareness of the technical and social subtleties involved, with special recognition for NCFTA, a public/private partnership with strong FBI ties.
9. No legislative or regulatory relief is sought in these remarks. The manner in which government and industry have coordinated and cooperated on botnet takedown efforts underscores the effectiveness of public/private partnerships that provide the necessary flexibility and adaptability to face and eliminate botnet threats.

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the subcommittee, this concludes my written statement. Thank you again for this opportunity to speak on this important topic, and I would be happy to answer your questions.
