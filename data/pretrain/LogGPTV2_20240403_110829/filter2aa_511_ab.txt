From its humble academic origins in 1969 to the present planetary-scale digital fabric
interconnecting most humans and facilitating almost all commerce, the Internet has seen
continuous wildcat growth. As a platform for innovation, the Internet is unequaled in all
of human history for the value it has created and the tools it has made available to every
person in every nation. The level of freedom allowed to innovators on the Internet is
unprecedented – pretty much any smart person or team can try out almost any idea, with
a built-in global audience and perhaps an immediate global market as well.
The invisible cost of this growth and innovative value creation is that much of the
software we run on many of our connected devices was given wide exposure and perhaps
forgotten by its maker without receiving “red team” testing to check for vulnerabilities.
The challenge for the Internet is that today there is perhaps more assurance that a U.L.
Listed toaster oven will not burn our house down than there is that some of our vastly
more expensive and powerful Internet-connected devices are insulated from becoming a
tool of online criminals.
The economics of this situation also can be challenging, since in the fast-changing, high-
growth Internet-enabled economy the winners are characterized by short time to market,
low cost, and high volume. Innovators may not always have the time or resources to
address potential security issues, so we live in a culture of “patching it later.” During the
preparation of these remarks, I read news reports of an Internet-enabled light bulb, part of
the “Internet of things,” that was found to be vulnerable to a simple attack in which it
would expose the local wireless network password to anyone who asked. It is extremely
unlikely that any of these flawed light bulbs can be patched or that their owners can or
will be informed of the need to return the product for a refund or exchange. So while the
world needs the Internet and the Internet’s powers of economic growth and innovation,
the cost to the world is that many tens of millions of connected devices can easily and
quite often do become tools for criminals. Some companies know this and are addressing
it, but much work remains.
But the pace of innovation and adaptation on the Internet is being matched by the pace of
innovation and adaptation by criminal bot masters. After a software flaw leading to
vulnerability is found and circulated, it is quickly exploited for criminal purposes. The
first step is to use the flaw to install software used by criminals to manage the new
computer as part of a botnet. Later steps will be to install specific software tools to
facilitate various kinds of online crime like DDoS attacks, spamming, key logging,
credential theft, or identity theft. The most important role of every member of a botnet is:
find and infect more victims. Thus virtually all software flaws are exercised indirectly,
using other infected computers. Criminals can operate their infrastructure through so
many layers of proxies and middle-men that it’s almost impossible to trace most criminal
acts back to their actors. As corollaries, it’s safe to say two things: (1) Most Internet
crime could not exist without botnets; and (2) Botnets could not exist absent a never-
ending series of software flaws in Internet connected devices.
This is not a call for regulatory relief. The Internet’s success has come organically; that
is, not just without a plan but precisely because there was no plan. No national
government or super-national governance body could, or should try to, put this genie into
a bottle. Rather, we must take stock of some long-invisible costs and make informed
decisions as a nation and as a society on which of the Internet’s costs we should just live
with versus which costs are high enough that we should seek out cheaper alternatives.
The primary ways to lower these costs are no different than any non-Internet field: (1)
Understand our situation; (2) Make our choices with eyes wide open; and (3) Invest or
front-load wherever it will reduce costs in the long run.
Finally, I’d like to quote an ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)
report from 2002:
With the advent of high speed "always on" connections, these PCs
add up to either an enormous global threat, or a bonanza of freely
retargetable resources, depending upon one's point of view.4
Regrettably, the major trend in the twelve years since that report was written is growth –
more Internet connected devices, more software flaws, more botnets, and more crime.
IV.
STEPS FOR THE FUTURE
Next, I’d like to describe what I think are some practical and effective next steps we can
take toward some short and medium term goals. As you’ll see, I believe that we can get
the most traction by going after the causes, enablers, and attractions of botnets, rather
than just beefing up our ability to take down botnets.
Awareness campaigns have played a notable role in slowing the spread of human
diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV. Given the danger that an unpatched and
undefended Internet connected device can pose to the world’s economy as well as to the
privacy and safety of its owner and other humans, why would we do less to stop the
spread of botnets? I hope to see the day when every user of the Internet knows that if
their device is out of date and terribly slow, it is probably infected with malicious
software that makes the device steal their identity, send spam, and participate in DDoS
attacks.
The US Government is one of the world’s largest buyers of Information Technology (IT).
Any technical requirement that becomes part of the Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) stands a good chance of becoming a de-facto standard for the world.
Since DDoS attacks often rely on the lack of Source Address Validation (SAV) by an
ISP, perhaps we should investigate requiring SAV by date-certain for all ISPs and hosting
or cloud service providers who wish to sell services to the US Government.
Ensuring the security of critical infrastructure is a high priority for both government and
industry. It may be useful to explore empaneling a blue ribbon committee to identify and
recommend best practices for securing network and server architecture operating
industrial control systems, especially as it relates to connected devices, connections
between the hot side and the outside, and software testing and patching protocols for
those systems. Some of the Conficker-infected computers we tracked in 2008 and 2009
turned out to be industrial controllers for medical equipment including in some cases
human life/safety monitors used in surgical operating theatres. While there may be some
subtleties involved in getting these embedded computers patched without triggering full
recertification, there’s no question that these computers should not be connected to the
open Internet, or that the staff’s first clue that they have a problem should not be a phone
call from the Conficker Working Group. We are now a connected society, and we need to
find more ways to front-load security protections into Internet-connected services and
offerings. To this end, government should continue to support and encourage industry-led
groups like M3AAWG – which has been active in publishing reports and developing
voluntary practices aimed at strengthening and facilitating botnet detection and
remediation – and public/private partnerships like NCFTA.
V.
CONCLUSION
I’ve given a very brief overview of the botnet problem, its causes, its impact, and its
likely future assuming we allow nature to take its course. I’d like to leave you with the
following thoughts:
1. The Internet is the greatest invention in recorded history, in terms of its positive
impact on human health, education, freedom, and on every national economy.
2. We have necessarily cut some corners on device and software safety and quality
in order to innovate at breakneck speed from 1969 to now – time-to-market, not
resistance to takeover, has often been our overriding engineering principle.
3. The Internet is also therefore the greatest invention in recorded history in terms of
its negative impact on human privacy and freedom, as evidenced by the massive
and continuing illicit transfer of wealth from productive people and countries
toward unproductive people and countries.
4. Our democratic commitment to the rule of law has very little traction on the
Internet compared to how the rule of law works in the real world. The Internet is
borderless and lawless, but carries more of the world’s commerce every year.
5. These problems manifest as “botnets” which are networks of robots, where the
robots in question are using our connected devices in ways we never agreed to.
6. Takedown of criminal infrastructure including “botnets” must be approached not
just as reactions after the fact but also as prevention by attacking the underlying
causes.
7. Takedown is no single agency’s or any single company’s job, and unilateralism
never ends well in any case – so, cooperation and multilateralism must be our
guiding lights.
8. The US Department of Justice is the envy of the world in its approach to
takedown and its awareness of the technical and social subtleties involved, with a
special shout-out to NCFTA, a public/private partnership with strong FBI ties.
9. No legislative or regulatory relief is sought in these remarks – the manner in
which government and industry have coordinated and cooperated on botnet
takedown efforts have underscored the effectiveness of public/private partnerships
that afford all affected parties the necessary degree of flexibility and adaptability
to face and eliminate botnet threats.
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Graham and Members of the subcommittee, this
concludes my written statement. Thank you again for this opportunity to speak before
you today on this important topic, and I would be happy to answer your questions.
