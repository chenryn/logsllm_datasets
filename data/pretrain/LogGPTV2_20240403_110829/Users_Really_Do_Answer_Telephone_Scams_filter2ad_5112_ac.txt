the scam during the survey process. This metric, which we
call Possibly Tricked, provides a reasonable estimate of the
actual number of recipients that fell for the scam by entering
the last four digits of their Social Security number. Compared
to the previous metrics, this metric provides a good balance
of conservativeness and sample size, and, therefore, we use
this metric for our analysis.

entering their real SSN information
of their Social Security number. Experiment 5 (202 area code,
unclaimed tax return) had the lowest success rate among all
experiments, with an estimate of only 0.33% (1/300) of recip-
ients possibly tricked into entering the last four digits of their
Social Security number.

Figure 4 presents a view of the number of possibly tricked
recipients for each experiment, ranked from most successful to
least successful. The tabulated data is in Table 3. Comparing
the possibly tricked result between experiments, experiment
E9 (spoofed caller ID) had the highest possibly tricked rate
among all experiments, with an estimate of 10.33% (31/300)
of recipients possibly tricked into entering the last four digits
The next step is to decide on an appropriate method of data
analysis on the chosen metric. With a myriad of possible data
analysis methods, we decided to use both linear regression
and statistical hypothesis testing analysis. Linear regression
is a model-based analysis can produce a model that can ﬁt
an optimal mapping of attribute properties to the results (i.e.
possibly tricked). However, such method tend to overﬁt the
spurious correlations that occur in training data since it is a

Furthermore, the attribute properties
used in our experiments are also not conditionally indepen-
dent. Nonetheless, the results of linear regression analysis are
shown in Table 4 and Figure 5.
Alternatively, we used a statistical hypothesis testing ap-
proach for analysis. Before doing statistical hypothesis testing,
we asked, “what are the hypothesis questions that our data
can provide an answer for?” We will provide a discussion
on the hypothesis questions we decided to ask and how we
applied a data analysis method to provide a contextual answer
to the hypothesis questions. Because we are testing several
hypotheses, we perform the Holm-Bonferroni step-down cor-
rection [30] on the signiﬁcance tests. The results are shown
in Table 5 sorted by the individual p-value.
Can manipulating the area code have a signiﬁcant effect
on the attack success of a telephone scam?
In the real world, we observed that telephone scammers
used area code manipulation in many instances (in particular
in Neighbor Spooﬁng scams [16]). To provide an answer
to this question, we can compare the number of possibly
tricked between similar experiments that used different area
codes, i.e., E1, E2, and E3. We see that E1 had 0.67% possibly
tricked, E2 had 4% possibly tricked, and E3 had 2% possibly
tricked.
In our question concerning the signiﬁcance of area code,
since E1 and E2 have the greatest difference in the number
of possibly tricked recipients, we test if using a toll-free area
code is signiﬁcantly more effective than Washington, DC area
code in the context of the IRS scam example. So we perform a
right-tailed p-value hypothesis testing approach on the chosen
experiment groups (E1 vs. E2) using the adjusted p-value
corrected with Holm-Bonferroni’s step-down method [30].
The use of right-tailed p-value statistical hypothesis testing
approach is a method to answer if it is "likely" or "unlikely"
to observe the improved alternative hypothesis (i.e. E2 pos-
sibly tricked) – assuming that the null hypothesis is true (i.e.
probability distribution of E1 possibly tricked).
With regards to the choice of using Bayesian vs. Frequentist
methods, since we are aware of no similar prior experiments,
we can only use Frequentist methods to calculate the statistical
signiﬁcance on the underlying truths using only data from the
current experiment.
In addition, not only do we want to know if the improve-
ment to attack success is signiﬁcant, it is also important to
know the magnitude of improvement. To avoid making state-
ments such as “E2 is 5 times more effective than E1”, instead
of measuring the relative difference, we calculated Cohen’s
d to measure the effect size for comparison between the two
groups.
Using the right-tailed p-value approach, we have a χ2 statis-
tic of 7.314 and an adjusted p-value of 0.00684. Using an
arbitrary conﬁdence level of 95%, it is very likely that using
a toll-free area code can result in a more successful attack
than using a Washington, DC area code in the context of the
IRS scam example. The two groups also have a Cohen’s d of
0.222, which suggests it has a small effect according to Co-
hen [31] and has a somewhat educationally signiﬁcant effect
according to Wolf [32]. Therefore, we could say that the area
code can have a statistically signiﬁcant yet somewhat minor
effect on the attack success of telephone phishing scam.
Can manipulating the type of voice production have a sig-
niﬁcant effect on the attack success of a telephone scam?
To provide an answer to this question, we can compare the
number of possibly tricked between similar experiments that
used different types of voice production, i.e., E1 and E6. In
our question concerning the signiﬁcance of voice production,
we test if using a recorded human voice is signiﬁcantly more
effective than using synthesized voice in the context of the
IRS scam example.
Using the same right-tailed p-value approach, we have a
χ2 statistic of 2.027 and an adjusted p-value of 0.155. Using
an arbitrary conﬁdence level of 95%, we cannot conclude that
using a recorded human voice can result in a more successful
attack than using synthesized voice in the context of the IRS
scam example. The two groups have a Cohen’s d of 0.117,
which also suggests the effect size is very small and not edu-
cationally signiﬁcant. Therefore, we are not able to conclude
at this time if the type of voice production has a signiﬁcant
effect on the attack success of a telephone phishing scam.
Can manipulating the voice gender have a signiﬁcant ef-
fect on the attack success of a telephone scam?
For the telephone scammer, the voice gender of the voice
synthesizer can be easily changed with a simple option click
in the autodialer. To provide an answer to this question, we
compare the number of possibly tricked between similar ex-
periments that used different voice genders, i.e., E1 and E4. In
our question concerning the signiﬁcance of voice gender, we
test if using a female synthesized voice is signiﬁcantly more
effective than using male synthesized voice in the context of
the IRS scam example.
Using the same right-tailed p-value approach, we have a
χ2 statistic of 5.442 and an adjusted p-value of 0.0197. Using
an arbitrary conﬁdence level of 95%, it is unlikely that using
