### 4.1 User Profile Pollution

To evaluate the impact of profile pollution, we create multiple copies of each user's profile and load them under different pollution settings. The user web traces are replayed to generate profiles that are polluted by forwarding the request to the profile polluter after visiting the fraudulent publisher. We also create clean profiles by replaying user web traces while bypassing the profile polluter. To eliminate the influence of time and location on the distribution of ads, each user's profiles are generated by replaying her web trace at the same time from the same IP address. This approach allows us to measure the extent to which pollution affects the type of ads targeted at the user. For every experiment in the following sections, we record the ads targeted at the user with and without profile pollution.

### 4.2 Pollution Content

As described in Section 3.1, user profiles are polluted to mislead the ad exchange and advertisers into targeting ads from more lucrative verticals at users visiting the fraudulent publisher's webpage. We pollute each user by generating camouflaged visits to three websites from the top three most expensive display ad categories: Health, Business, and Education. Additionally, we select two less valuable ad categories, Sports and Shopping, to study the attack on these categories.

#### Polluting for Behavioral Targeting

To find websites that alter the user’s interest profile towards the specified categories, we first filter websites from the corresponding Alexa category that contain the DoubleClick tracking script. For each website in this list, we use the Google Ad Preferences Dashboard [7] to build a map between the websites and categories consistent with DoubleClick. Table 1 lists the three websites selected for each category.

#### Polluting for Re-Marketing Targeting

Similarly, we filter websites in the Alexa category that host the re-marketing script from DoubleClick. We verify that the category matches and that the re-marketing campaign is active. Table 1 also lists the websites used for re-marketing pollution for each category.

| **Google Category** | **Alexa Category** | **Re-marketing Pollution Contents** | **Behavioral Pollution Contents** |

### 4.3 Ad Crawler Overview

The ad crawler consists of several main modules:

#### DOM Parser/Preprocessor

This module parses the DOM structure of the page and extracts specific attributes of display ads that reveal the landing page (the website visited by clicking the ad). Display ads are often embedded in nested iframe tags, spanning multiple levels. To bypass the same-origin policy enforced by modern web browsers, we disable the web security mechanism of the PhantomJS headless browser. The DOM Parser reads the `src` or `href` attributes for image or flash ads and aggregates this information for further processing. It also logs DoubleClick elements (re-marketing scripts and cookies) on the page, detected by searching for unique DoubleClick JavaScript code and monitoring outgoing HTTP requests.

#### Ad Landing Page Extractor

For each identified ad element, this module infers the landing page by parsing the value of the attributes extracted by the DOM parser and searching for specific patterns in the URL like `adurl=`, `redirect_url=`, etc. In our experiments, approximately 80% of the ads have a landing page encoded by these patterns, while the remaining ads require following HTTP redirects. We do not follow these redirects to avoid artificially inflating click-through rates and biasing the user profile inferred by DoubleClick.

#### Semantic Categories of the Ad URL

The landing domains of the ads are categorized into one of the 13 top-level Alexa web categories. For each landing domain, we query www.alexa.com to find its corresponding category. If no results are returned, we query www.similarsites.com, which provides a similar categorizer using the Alexa taxonomy for a larger catalog of URLs. Finally, if both queries fail, we manually categorize the URL.

#### Verifying the Ad Crawler

We verify the end-to-end implementation of the ad crawler by setting up our own re-marketing ad campaign on Google AdWords and driving fake traffic to the website using a traffic emulator. During the campaign, we confirmed that the ad crawling framework could capture our re-marketing ads across various websites, and the number of ad impressions closely matched the number reported by Google AdWords.

### 4.4 Ad Revenue Estimation

The final component of our setup is to estimate the ad revenue generated by the fraudulent publisher. We use the publicly available report provided by Google, which ranks the CPM cost of different ad verticals and associates each vertical with a relative cost index [26]. The index for the three most expensive categories—Health, Business, and Job & Education—are 257, 221, and 200, respectively. The least expensive category is Law & Government, with an index of 46. We manually map each of the 13 top-level Alexa categories to one of the ad verticals used in the published Google report. Our revenue estimation analysis always compares the revenue generated by the pollution attack with the baseline revenue computed by running the exact same experiment without pollution.

### 5. Validation and Effectiveness of the Attack

In this section, we evaluate the impact of profile pollution on the ads by deploying the attack on a controlled publisher webpage. The primary metric used for evaluation is the relative change in ads from the desired ad category (behavioral pollution) or domain (re-marketing pollution) with and without pollution. For both user profile sets, the trace emulator first visits every website in a user’s trace to ensure that all users have an online interest profile. We then pollute one set of user profiles and subsequently have users from both sets visit the controlled publisher page once every hour for 50 hours. For each visit, the ad crawler captures all the ads.

#### 5.1 Pollution Using Re-Marketing Campaigns

Figure 5 shows the fraction of ads received with and without profile pollution across all users. As expected, only the polluted users receive ads from the category used in the pollution. Surprisingly, re-marketing ads aggressively target users, both in terms of the time between the pollution and the first ad shown, and the number of ads. Across all categories, users receive ads from the intended advertisers immediately in the very first visit to the publisher’s webpage, and approximately 40-50% of all display ads are from these advertisers. We also verified the distribution of ads across users and found that all users received ads from the re-marketing campaigns used for pollution.

Next, we characterize the extent to which the polluter can increase the number of ad impressions served from the re-marketing advertisers by varying the number of advertisers used for pollution. Table 2 shows the fraction of re-marketing ads delivered to the users who are polluted by increasing the number of re-marketing campaigns from one to five. With two re-marketing campaigns, the polluter can modify an average of 61% of ad impressions (min=26%, max=85%), and with three campaigns, the average increases to 80% (min=40%, max=97%). Beyond three advertisers, the increase in the fraction of ads delivered from the compromised campaigns is much lower. This indicates that the aggressive targeting performed by re-marketing campaigns enables the polluter to control a large fraction of ads displayed to the user.

While the pollution is highly effective once triggered, advertisers may set up specific rules to trigger the campaign that can impact the publisher’s ad revenue. For example, advertisers can set up time-based triggers, frequency caps, or pause the campaign. Additionally, the advertiser may set up the campaign with a more complex control flow of user actions and trigger the campaign only when a user completes all the steps. Thus, the primary challenge in effectively exploiting re-marketing campaigns is to select pollution content that accounts for such specific trigger rules.

#### 5.2 Pollution Using Behavioral Targeting Campaigns

##### Impact on Ad Categories

We characterize how the pollution attack alters the distribution of ads across different semantic categories. Intuitively, polluting a user’s profile towards a specific category (e.g., Health) should increase the number of ads delivered in that category, while decreasing the number of ads from other categories. This relative change impacts the publisher’s net revenue.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of ads across the 13 top-level Alexa categories for user profiles that were not polluted. We observe that the ad distribution spans multiple categories as users have diverse online interests. We use this baseline distribution to compute the relative change in the distribution of ad categories after pollution. Figure 7 shows the relative change in the ad categories across users, validating the effectiveness of our pollution attack. There is a clear increase in ads in the polluted category, with a maximum increase of 12% for the Shopping category. Moreover, the pollution manages to increase the number of ads in categories that a user already received prior to pollution. For example, the fraction of ads in the Health category increases from 23% to 31%.

##### Temporal Impact

Finally, we study the temporal effect of the pollution. Figure 8 shows the relative increase in the fraction of ads received from the category used for pollution. We observe that the effect of the pollution is immediate and leads to an increase in ads from the desired category. The effect of the pollution persists over the entire time duration of the experiment, indicating that categories introduced artificially as an effect of the pollution have a lasting influence on the ads received by the user.

### Summary of Behavioral Pollution

The results above indicate that our approach for behavioral pollution does indeed impact the ads targeted at the user. The effectiveness of the pollution depends on factors such as the user’s existing profile and the context of the publisher.
