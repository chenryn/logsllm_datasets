User: In Python, am using the LightBlue module for Bluetooth connectivity. How do I get the speed at which I am sending file to my phone from my laptop (Ubuntu)?
Assistant: You need a binding for the Bluetooth driver/OS service that handles the Bluetooth device.
Most drivers are written in C, some in C++. If you can get the source code/API or if it's provided you might be able to access it from python. You might need to code some custom binding to your OS service to do so.
