Scaling
Database scaling is the ability to increase database throughput by
utilizing additional resources such as I/O, memory, CPU, or
additional computers.
However,the high concurrency and write requirements of
database servers make scaling a challenge. Sometimes scaling is
only possible with multiple sessions, while other options require
data model adjustments or server configuration changes.
