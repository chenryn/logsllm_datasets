I've noticed some odd behavior with the syntax colourisation for template
strings in Visual Studio 2013 (using TypeScript 1.4 plugin). It occurs when
the string "#/" is present within the template string **after** at least one
placeholder is present. I realise reading that is as clear as mud so look at
the screenshot below for clarification:

As you can see the first 2 examples colourise in the fashion you would hope.
The 3rd example behaves in an unexpected fashion after the "#/". Here's the
code you can use to reproduce it with:
    class highlightingBug {
        demo() {
            var urlWithoutHash =
                `i_look_kind_of_normal_${"I_think"}`;
            var urlWithHash =
                `and_so_do_I_even_with_#/_in_place_${"I_think"}`;
            var urlWithHashAfterFirstPlaceHolder =
                `${"But_me_"}_well_things_look_a_little_odd_colour_wise_after_the_#/_${"That_is_what_I_think_anyway"}`;
        }
    }
