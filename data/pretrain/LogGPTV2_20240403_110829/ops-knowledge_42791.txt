User: After going through hell trying to install the latest version of postgresql and psycopg2 today I'm going for a complete reinstall of Leopard.
I've been sticking with macpython 2.5 for the past year but now I'm considering macports even 2.6
For me it's most important for Twisted, PIL and psycopg2 to be working without a problem.
Can anyone give some guidelines for what version I should choose, based on experience? 
Edit:
Ok I've decided to go without reinstalling the os. Hacked around to clean up the bad PostgresPlus installation and installed another one. The official python 2.6.1 package works great, no problem installing it alongside 2.5.2. Psycopg2 works. But as expected PIL wont compile. 
I guess I'll be switching between the 2.5 from macports and the official 2.6 for different tasks, since I know the macports python has it's issues with some packages.
Another Edit:
I've now compiled PIL. Had to hide the whole macports directory and half the xcode libraries, so it would find the right ones. It wouldn't accept the paths I was feeding it. PIL is notorious for this on leopard.
Assistant: I use both Twisted and Psycopg2 extensively on OSX, and both work fine with Python 2.6.  Neither has been ported to Python 3.0, as far as I know.
Several of Python 3.0's features have been back-ported to 2.6, so you gain quite a bit by moving from 2.5 to 2.6.  But I wouldn't switch to 3.0 until all of your thirdparty libraries support it; and this may not happen for some time.
