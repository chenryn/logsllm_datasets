Much more extensive research, which is beyond the scope of
this paper, is needed in order to understand the relative merits of
survey-based and behavioral data-based approaches to eliciting
privacy preferences and learning about data sensitivity. For
example, our survey results present some supportive evidence
that gender may affect sensitivity perception and sharing
comfort. The survey results suggest that women may be more
comfortable writing about Friendship with their real names
than men – 20.5% vs 12.8% (p-value 0.02), while men may
be more willing to discuss Prostitution anonymously than
women – 3.8/7 vs 3.3/7 (p-value 0.02). We leave an in-depth
investigation of factors affecting sensitivity perceptions and
comparison between approaches to future work.
VIII. RELATED WORK
1) Understanding User Privacy Preferences via Surveys:
Online surveys and personal
interviews are the predomi-
nant method currently used for learning about user privacy
expectations, and identifying problems in existing privacy-
related offerings. They have been used to examine privacy
preferences in e-commerce [53], understanding concerns related
to disclosure of health information online [54], learn about
privacy expectations in location based systems [55], [56], [57]
and in social networks [58], [59]. Surveys have also been used
to understand why people regret posting online and identify
sensitive topic themes [20], or to capture user preferences about
anonymity and data sensitivity online [60].
Survey-based learning of privacy preferences is more difﬁcult
and more expensive than our proposed approach when it needs
to be adopted to a speciﬁc product, to potential cultural, loca-
tion, language or demographic-based differences in preferences
among users, or to shift in preferences over time. However, they
are a useful complementary approach to that of the behavioral

data-driven one we propose, and can help in formulating
questions or hypotheses, providing illustrative examples, etc.
The survey-based work with the goal most similar to ours by
Wang et al [20] identiﬁes anecdotal examples of user sharing
regrets from many of the same themes we discover: personal
and family issues, religion and politics, work and company,
sex, and illegal drug use.
2) Understanding Privacy Risks of Product Usage: Under-
standing how users use product features with potential privacy
implications can help identify and mitigate potential privacy
risks. [27] studies the security and privacy of private browsing
modes in web browsers and how installed plugins and browser
extensions may undermine the security of private browsing.
[61] performs a large-scale quantitative analysis of delete tweet
feature in Twitter, and highlights the privacy ramiﬁcations of
availability of deleted tweets outside of Twitter. [62] performs
a quantitative study of the amount and kinds of personally
identiﬁable information disclosed in Twitter messages and
potential privacy implications of such disclosures.
3) Minimizing Regret When Sharing: Recent work has begun
to make steps towards understanding and minimizing user
regret when sharing on social networks. Via a combination
of surveys, interviews and log analyses, [26] investigates how
active users organize and select audiences for sharing content
on the Google+ social network. [63] studies deleted bullying
tweets on Twitter, and proposes building a regrettable tweets
predictor to warn users if a tweet might cause user regret later.
[64] proposes a template for the design of a social networking
privacy wizard, that builds a machine learning classier to
learn from a small sample of user’s privacy preferences,
and then uses this classiﬁer to conﬁgure the user’s privacy
settings automatically. Our work, particularly in Section VI,
complements these efforts and provides evidence in support of
feasibility of product features aimed at minimizing regret.
4) Other Work Studying Quora: Our work is not the ﬁrst
in using Quora to gain insights into individuals’ behavior. For
example, [42] makes an attempt to understand what drives the
growth of question-and-answer websites like Quora, and how
does it attract and motivate visitors to contribute, while [41]
studies the reputation mechanisms in Quora, i.e., how users
judge the authoritativeness of other users and content, build
reputation, and identify and promote high quality content.
IX. CONCLUSION
We performed a large-scale analysis of user anonymity
choices during their activity on Quora, a popular question-and-
answer site, to determine user content sensitivity preferences.
We enumerated different analysis methodologies on contexts,
topics, and words, and identiﬁed sensitive themes that are not
included in the common characterizations of content sensitivity.
We built several machine learning models able to predict user
anonymity choices better than a ﬁxed guess would, suggesting
a possibility for features improving user experience.
Although much more in-depth research is needed, our work
makes the ﬁrst step to show that data-driven analysis of users’
use of privacy-enhancing product features can improve our
ability to understand user privacy preferences and expectations
at scale, and enable online services to develop policies and
features that better protect their users.
