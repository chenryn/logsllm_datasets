### Complementary Research Approaches
User surveys and behavioral data can complement and support each other in research. For instance, survey-based data can provide insights into user preferences and perceptions, while behavioral data can offer a more granular and real-time understanding of actual user behavior.

### Survey Results on Anonymity and Real Name Usage
The following figure illustrates the percentage of respondents who indicated they would be comfortable writing about various topics anonymously versus using their real names.

| Topic                     | Anonymous (%) | Real Name (%) |
|---------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Recreational Drugs        | 7.8           | 4.5           |
| Prostitution              | 7.2           | 4.8           |
| Legal Topics              | 7.3           | 6.4           |
| Depression                | 10.7          | 6.9           |
| Poverty                   | 9.7           | 8.2           |
| Superhero Films           | 9.6           | 10.9          |
| Religion & Beliefs        | 14.1          | 12.1          |
| Government Leaders        | 14.2          | 13.2          |
| Mobile Phones             | 11.6          | 13.3          |
| Friendship                | 16.1          | 19.1          |

### Need for Further Research
Extensive research is needed to fully understand the relative merits of survey-based and behavioral data-based approaches in eliciting privacy preferences and learning about data sensitivity. For example, our survey results suggest that gender may influence sensitivity perception and sharing comfort. Women appear to be more comfortable discussing "Friendship" with their real names (20.5% vs. 12.8% for men, p-value 0.02). Conversely, men are more likely to discuss "Prostitution" anonymously (3.8% vs. 3.3% for women, p-value 0.02). A deeper investigation into factors affecting sensitivity perceptions and a comparison between different approaches is left for future work.

#### 1. Understanding User Privacy Preferences via Surveys
Online surveys and personal interviews are the predominant methods used to learn about user privacy expectations and identify issues in existing privacy-related offerings. These methods have been applied to various contexts, such as e-commerce [53], health information disclosure online [54], location-based systems [55, 56, 57], and social networks [58, 59]. Surveys have also been used to understand why people regret posting online and to identify sensitive topic themes [20], or to capture user preferences about anonymity and data sensitivity [60].

Survey-based learning of privacy preferences can be more difficult and expensive, especially when tailored to specific products, cultural, location, language, or demographic differences, or when preferences shift over time. However, surveys are a useful complementary approach to the behavioral data-driven method we propose. They can help in formulating questions, providing illustrative examples, and generating hypotheses. The survey-based work by Wang et al. [20] identifies anecdotal examples of user sharing regrets from themes similar to those we discovered: personal and family issues, religion and politics, work and company, sex, and illegal drug use.

#### 2. Understanding Privacy Risks of Product Usage
Understanding how users utilize product features with potential privacy implications can help identify and mitigate privacy risks. For example, [27] studies the security and privacy of private browsing modes in web browsers and the impact of installed plugins and browser extensions. [61] performs a large-scale quantitative analysis of the delete tweet feature on Twitter, highlighting the privacy ramifications of deleted tweets being available outside of Twitter. [62] quantitatively examines the amount and types of personally identifiable information disclosed in Twitter messages and the potential privacy implications of such disclosures.

#### 3. Minimizing Regret When Sharing
Recent work has begun to explore ways to minimize user regret when sharing on social networks. [26] investigates how active users organize and select audiences for sharing content on Google+ through a combination of surveys, interviews, and log analyses. [63] studies deleted bullying tweets on Twitter and proposes building a predictor to warn users if a tweet might cause regret later. [64] proposes a template for designing a social networking privacy wizard that uses machine learning to configure users' privacy settings based on a small sample of their preferences. Our work, particularly in Section VI, complements these efforts and provides evidence supporting the feasibility of product features aimed at minimizing regret.

#### 4. Other Work Studying Quora
Our work is not the first to use Quora to gain insights into individual behavior. For example, [42] attempts to understand what drives the growth of question-and-answer websites like Quora and how it attracts and motivates visitors to contribute. [41] studies the reputation mechanisms in Quora, including how users judge the authoritativeness of other users and content, build reputation, and promote high-quality content.

### Conclusion
We conducted a large-scale analysis of user anonymity choices on Quora, a popular question-and-answer site, to determine user content sensitivity preferences. We employed various analysis methodologies to identify sensitive themes not commonly characterized. We built several machine learning models that predict user anonymity choices better than a fixed guess, suggesting the potential for features that improve user experience.

Although more in-depth research is needed, our work takes the first step in showing that data-driven analysis of users' use of privacy-enhancing product features can improve our ability to understand user privacy preferences and expectations at scale. This can enable online services to develop policies and features that better protect their users.
