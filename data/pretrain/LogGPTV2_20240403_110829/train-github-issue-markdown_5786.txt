Hi,
I have created HiddenEntityType (https://gist.github.com/kl3ryk/5781916), to
transform value of hidden field into Entity. I was using
FormBuilderInterface::getParent() to get Entity class. But in Symfony 2.3
function FormBuilderInterface::getParent was removed. So is there any way to
retreive parent form data_class name
