User: Background
I would like my Python script to pause before exiting using something similar to:
raw_input("Press enter to close.")
but only if it is NOT run via command line. Command line programs shouldn't behave this way.
Question
Is there a way to determine if my Python script was invoked from the command line:
$ python myscript.py
verses double-clicking myscript.py to open it with the default interpreter in the OS?
Assistant: This is typically done manually/, I don't think there is an automatic way to do it that works for every case. 
You should add a --pause argument to your script that does the prompt for a key at the end.
When the script is invoked from a command line by hand, then the user can add --pause if desired, but by default there won't be any wait.
When the script is launched from an icon, the arguments in the icon should include the --pause, so that there is a wait. Unfortunately you will need to either document the use of this option so that the user knows that it needs to be added when creating an icon, or else, provide an icon creation function in your script that works for your target OS.
