### Incident Report and System Analysis

#### Attacker Intent
- **Tank Underflow and Damage**: The attacker aims to cause underflow in tanks, leading to potential damage to pumps (P-101, P-301, P-302).
- **Backwash Process Disruption**: The backwash process is repeatedly started, disrupting normal operations and causing a decrease in the water level of Tank 401.
- **UV Shutdown and Pump Control**: The attacker attempts to shut down the UV system and turn off Pump P-501, but these actions are not always successful.
- **Tank Overflow**: The attacker also aims to cause overflow in various tanks.

#### Detection Accuracy
- **OC-SVM Detection Accuracy**:
  - **Tank Overflow**: 100%
  - **Tank Underflow**: 66.66% (for Tank 101 underflow and Tank 301 overflow)
  - **Tank 101 Underflow and Tank 301 Overflow**: 37.5%

#### Summary
- The attacker's primary goals include causing tank underflow and overflow, disrupting the backwash process, and manipulating the UV system and pumps.
- The OC-SVM detection accuracy for tank overflow is 100%, while for tank underflow, it varies.
- Detailed timelines and actions taken during each incident are provided to help understand the sequence of events and the response to each attack.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the incidents, their impacts, and the measures taken to detect and respond to the attacks.
