TL;DR : I think this can be done in the **density tests** , we just need to
vary them so that there are **collisions** (dupe pods) being submitted.
... In a real kube system, there is a likliehood that 10 or 20 RC's might be
created simultaneously.
We should ensure that the if we submit, say 100 concurrent pod creation
requests,
  * (consistency) The systems state is consistent such that _duplicate_ pods aren't created, and at least some requests are _rejected_.
  * (availability) every unique submission is eventually created.
