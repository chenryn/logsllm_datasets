### Optimized Text

**Current Setup:**
- 4 servers running a single RethinkDB instance in a cluster (4 shards, 3 replicas per table).
- 2 application servers (Tornado + RethinkDB proxy).
- Clients connect only to their local proxy.

**Objective:**
- Specify both the local and other proxies so that clients can fail over to the other proxies if their local proxy crashes or experiences issues.

**Solution:**

To achieve high availability and failover, I recommend using HAProxy instead of the RethinkDB local proxy. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

1. **HAProxy Configuration:**
   - Install and configure HAProxy on each application server.
   - Configure HAProxy to run in TCP mode and forward requests to the RethinkDB cluster.
   - Use Consul Template to dynamically update the HAProxy configuration when a RethinkDB node joins or leaves the cluster. This ensures that the HAProxy configuration is always up-to-date.

2. **Failover Mechanism:**
   - HAProxy supports various routing and failover scenarios, including backup backends. You can configure HAProxy to automatically switch to another proxy if the primary one fails.
   - Ensure that HAProxy is configured to monitor the health of the RethinkDB nodes and the local proxy. If a node or proxy becomes unresponsive, HAProxy will automatically redirect traffic to a healthy node or proxy.

3. **Process Monitoring:**
   - Use a process monitor like `systemd` to ensure that the HAProxy service is always running. If HAProxy crashes, `systemd` will automatically restart it.

**Benefits:**
- **Lightweight and Robust:** HAProxy is lightweight and highly reliable, making it an excellent choice for proxying requests.
- **Versatility:** HAProxy can be used for proxying other services such as MySQL and Redis, providing a unified solution for your infrastructure.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Using Consul Template, HAProxy can dynamically update its configuration, ensuring that it always reflects the current state of your RethinkDB cluster.

By implementing this setup, you can ensure that your clients can seamlessly fail over to another proxy in case their local proxy experiences issues, thus maintaining high availability and reliability.
