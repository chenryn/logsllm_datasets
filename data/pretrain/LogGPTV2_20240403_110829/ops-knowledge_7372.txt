User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I trace the IP address of person in chat? Is it possible to trace my IP address when I am chatting with others (with gtalk or Facebook)? If so, how could someone do that?

Assistant: Set up a web server and send them a link to something on it. Once they click the link, their IP address will be logged in your web server's access logs. 

You could also host an image on said web server and trick a user into loading it through a third party's website. Some social networking sites allow you to upload snippets of HTML including image tags.

Note, when I say "their IP address" I am referring to whatever the address is after any NAT and proxying.
