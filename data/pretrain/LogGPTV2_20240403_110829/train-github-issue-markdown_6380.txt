### Issue Report

#### I have verified that:
- [x] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
Importing specific components and types from `material-ui` should be possible directly from the top-level folder.

#### Current Behavior
The following imports produce a TypeScript error: `.../material-ui/index has no exported member`.

- `InputAdornment` (I believe this issue has already been resolved, see #8959)
- `Theme`
- `StyleRulesCallback`
- `TableFooter`
- `TablePagination`

#### Environment
| Tech        | Version   |
|-------------|-----------|
| Material-UI | @next     |
| React       | 16.2.0    |

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are further steps I can take to resolve this issue.
