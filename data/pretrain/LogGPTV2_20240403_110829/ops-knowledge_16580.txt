### Issue: Unable to Activate Virtual Environment on Windows

**Environment Details:**
- **Python Version:** 3.7
- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Virtualenv Version:** 20.2.x

**Steps Taken:**
1. Created a virtual environment named `venv` using the command:
   ```sh
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
   ```
2. Attempted to activate the virtual environment using the command:
   ```sh
   c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>source venv/bin/activate
   ```

**Error Encountered:**
```sh
'source' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

### Solution

The `source` command is specific to Unix-based systems (like Linux and macOS) and is not available in the standard Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. On Windows, you should use the following steps to activate the virtual environment:

1. **Using Command Prompt:**
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```sh
     cd c:\testdjangoproj\mysite
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment using:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

2. **Using PowerShell:**
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```sh
     cd c:\testdjangoproj\mysite
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment using:
     ```sh
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate
     ```

3. **Using Git Bash:**
   - If you are using Git Bash, you can use the `source` command with the correct path:
     ```sh
     source venv/Scripts/activate
     ```

### Additional Notes

- The `--no-site-packages` flag is deprecated and is now the default behavior in recent versions of `virtualenv`.
- Ensure that the `venv` directory and its `Scripts` subdirectory exist and contain the necessary activation scripts.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide any additional error messages or details for further assistance.
