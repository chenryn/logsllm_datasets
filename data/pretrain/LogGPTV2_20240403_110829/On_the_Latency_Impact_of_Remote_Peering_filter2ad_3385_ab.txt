### 3. Challenges in Inferring Remote Peering

Our method requires identifying which networks connect via remote connections at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). However, there are two distinct notions of remote peering.

#### Notions of Remote Peering

Conversations with IXP and reseller representatives revealed that the understanding of remote peering varies. Some consider remote peering based on the type of AS connection (e.g., using shared ports via resellers), regardless of the physical location, even if the AS is in the same city as the IXP. Others view remote peering based on the geographical distance to the IXP.

Figure 2 illustrates different ways ASes can connect to IXPs. Local ASes (A, B, C) connect directly to an IXP switch using a router deployed in the same facility. ASes can also connect via resellers, which provide ports and transport to the IXP, usually connecting the routers of the remote ASes to the IXP switches via layer-2 transport. ASes located close to the IXP (D, E) use resellers to reduce peering equipment and installation costs. Resellers can also bridge large geographical distances by connecting members far from the IXP (F, G). Finally, an AS may connect remotely without any reseller, using its own port at the IXP and purchasing transport to the port from the remote location (H).

#### Available Data Limits Accuracy of Remote Peering Inferences

The current state-of-the-art methodology for inferring remote peering, proposed by Giotsas et al. [27], identifies remote peering through a reseller and/or geographically distant from the IXP. The method combines delay measurements with additional features such as port capacity and AS presence at colocation facilities. If an AS is not present in one of the feasible IXP facilities, the method infers that the AS is remotely connected.

We used available ground truth data for four IXPs (LINX, PTT-SP, PTT-RJ, and PTT-CE) and applied their method to all interfaces connected to these IXPs. We implemented the four steps from the Giotsas et al. [27] method:

1. **Ping Measurement Campaign**: Measures the latency to IXP member interfaces from a vantage point within the IXP. Using scamper probers on RouteViews collectors, we performed delay measurements every two hours for two days, discarding measurements where replies had an IP-TTL value that appeared to have been decremented (i.e., not 64 or 255).
2. **Colocation-Informed RTT Interpretation**: Computes a geographical area where the IXP member router could be located using an AS to colocation facility mapping obtained from PeeringDB and IXP websites.
3. **Multi-IXP Router Inference** and **Finding Remote Peers via Port Capacities and Lack of Private Connectivity**: These steps complete the methodology.

Figure 3 shows the results we obtained. In [27], public information about AS presence at colocation facilities was missing for approximately 25% of remote peers and 18% of local peers. For LINX, the number of unknown inferences was low, and the fraction of remote and local interfaces inferred was similar to the published work [27]. This was likely due to the high PeeringDB coverage for LINX members (83.0%). However, for Brazilian IXPs (PTT-SP and PTT-CE), only 27.0% of the members had PeeringDB entries reporting both the IXP and facilities, leading to only 17.1% of the interfaces being classified. This low classification was due to the limited sharing of information in PeeringDB by ASes connected to Brazilian IXPs.

Additionally, 5.3–10.3% of the interfaces inferred as local peerings were actually remote, according to ground truth. This misclassification was related to incorrect information about AS presence in colocation facilities. In many cases, an AS using a reseller recorded the facility their reseller connected to in their PeeringDB record, leading the method [27] to infer the AS was locally connected. The other 1.0–4.3% of interfaces inferred as remote were correct but did not observably connect to the IXP via a reseller. In summary, the methodology of [27] may not be suitable for accurately inferring remote peering for IXPs with incomplete or inaccurate publicly available data.

### 4. Remote Peering at IXPs

Inferring remote peering (RP) based solely on reseller connections is imprecise, as it ignores geographically distant ASes not using reseller ports, which also incur a latency penalty. Conversely, examining only geographically distant peers overlooks RP through resellers. This diversity led us to evaluate RP by (1) connection type (Reseller RP) and (2) geographical distance to the IXP (Geographical RP).

To identify members using Reseller RP, we used ground truth data for four IXPs. To infer Geographical RP at all eight IXPs, we used the method in [15], which uses latency measurements and empirically obtained thresholds as a proxy for physical distance. For each IXP, we associated IXP member ASes and their assigned IXP IP addresses using the datasets mentioned in Section 2.2. We performed latency measurements to these addresses on May 5-6, 2021. From each RouteViews scamper instance, we probed each interface every two hours for two days, using the minimum latency for each address to account for transient congestion. We discarded measurements where the replies had an IP-TTL value that appeared to have been decremented (i.e., not 64 or 255). If the minimum latency from a given interface was 10 ms or higher, we classified the member’s router as remotely connected to the IXP; a latency of 10 ms corresponds to a distance of up to 1000 km from the IXP [33,49].

To further assess the correctness of our inferences, we obtained the colocation facilities of each of the eight analyzed IXPs from public data sources (IXP websites and PeeringDB) and computed the distance between them. Equinix Ashburn has the largest distance between facilities (80 km), corresponding to a latency of ≈1 ms. Therefore, any IXP peer interface with latency consistently higher than 10 ms is unlikely to be a local peer at the IXPs we examined.

### 4.1 Remotely Connected Members

Tables 2 and 3 summarize the number and percentage of interfaces connected via remote peering at each IXP.

#### Reseller RP

We observed a significant percentage of Reseller RP at the three Brazilian IXPs, representing more than 37.2% of their member base (Table 2).
