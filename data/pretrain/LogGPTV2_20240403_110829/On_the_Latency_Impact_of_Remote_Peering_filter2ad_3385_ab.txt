path as we selected diﬀerent IXP members. We provide further details about the
measurement methodology in the sections describing our results (Sect. 4, 5, 6).
3 Challenges in Inferring Remote Peering
Our method needs to know which networks connect via remote connections at
IXPs. However, there are two diﬀerent notions of remote peering.
Notions of Remote Peering. Conversations with IXP and reseller represen-
tatives revealed that notions of remote peering varied. Some considered remote
peering based on the AS connection type (e.g., using shared ports via resellers),
regardless of location (even those in the same city as the IXP). Other represen-
tatives viewed remote peering based on the geographical distance to the IXP.
Figure 2 shows diﬀerent ways that ASes can connect to IXPs. Local ASes
connect directly to an IXP switch using a router deployed in the same facility as
the switch (ASes A, B, C). ASes can also connect via resellers. Resellers provide
ports and transport to the IXP, usually connecting the routers of the remote ASes
to the IXP switches via layer-2 transport. ASes located close to the IXP (ASes
D, E) use resellers to lower peering equipment and installation costs. Resellers

Fig. 2. ASes connect to IXPs via local (ASes A, B, C) and remote connections, either
via a reseller (ASes D, E, F, G) or by purchasing transport from the remote location
to the IXP switch (AS H). Remote networks can be physically located near the IXP
(ASes D, E) or be geographically distant (ASes F, G, H).
can also bridge large geographical distances by connecting members located far
from the IXP (ASes F, G). Finally, an AS may also connect remotely without
any reseller ports, using its own port at the IXP and purchasing transport to
the port from the remote location (AS H).
Available Data Limits Accuracy of Remote Peering Inferences. The
current state-of-the-art methodology for inferring remote peering proposed by
Giotsas et al. [27] infers remote peering (1) through a reseller and/or (2) geo-
graphically distant from the IXP. The method combines delay measurements
with additional features, such as port capacity and AS presence at colocation
facilities; if an AS is not present in one of the feasible IXP facilities, their method
infers the AS is remotely connected. We used available ground truth (Sect. 2.2)
for four IXPs (LINX, PTT-SP, PTT-RJ, and PTT-CE) and applied their method
to all interfaces connected to these IXPs.
We implemented the four steps from the Giotsas et al. [27] method. The
ﬁrst step (ping measurement campaign) measures the latency to IXP member
interfaces from a VP within the IXP. Using the scamper probers on the Route-
Views collectors (Sect. 2.3), we performed delay measurements to the peering
interfaces of IXP members every two hours for two days, and discarded measure-
ments where the replies might have come from outside the peering infrastructure
because they had an IP-TTL value that appeared to have been decremented (i.e.,
the received IP-TTL was not 64 or 255). The second step (colocation-informed
RTT interpretation) computes a geographical area where the IXP member router
could be located using an AS to colocation facility mapping obtained from Peer-
ingDB and IXP websites. Then, we obtained publicly available RIPE Atlas IPv4
traceroute measurements collected on the same days as our ping campaign and

Fig. 3. Classiﬁcation of interfaces we obtained when we applied our implementation of
the current state-of-the-art methodology for inferring remote peering [27]. The high per-
centage of no inference for the three Brazilian IXPs was a consequence of the method’s
high reliance on public information (PeeringDB) which was not widely available for
members of Brazilian IXPs.
applied step 3 (multi-IXP router inference) and step 4 (ﬁnding remote peers via
port capacities and lack of private connectivity) to complete the methodology.
Figure 3 presents the results we obtained. In [27], public information about
AS presence at colocation facilities was missing for ≈25% of remote peers and
≈18% of local peers. When we reproduced the study, the number of unknown
inferences for LINX was low and the fraction of remote and local interfaces
inferred was similar with the published work [27], which we hypothesize was
because the PeeringDB coverage for LINX members that had valid information
about presence in IXP facilities was high (83.0%). The case for Brazilian IXPs
was diﬀerent. For PTT-SP and PTT-CE, only 27.0% of the members had Peer-
ingDB entries that reported both the IXP and facilities where they were present,
leading the current state-of-the-art method to only classify 17.1%, on average, of
the interfaces at the Brazilian IXPs. This low classiﬁcation was because few ASes
connected to the Brazilian IXPs shared their information in PeeringDB. Openly
publishing peering data has only recently been encouraged by IXP operators in
Brazil as best practice [39].
In addition, 5.3–10.3% of the interfaces inferred as local peerings were actually
remote, according to ground truth. We believe the misclassiﬁcation was related to
incorrect information about the presence of ASes in colocation facilities. In many
cases, an AS using a reseller recorded the facility their reseller connected to in their
PeeringDB record, leading the method [27] to infer the AS was locally connected.
The other 1.0–4.3% of interfaces inferred as remote were correct, but they did not
observably connect to the IXP via a reseller. In summary, the methodology of [27]
may not be suitable for accurately inferring remote peering for IXPs that have
incomplete or inaccurate publicly available data.

4 Remote Peering at IXPs
Inferring remote peering (RP) based solely on reseller connections is imprecise,
as it ignores geographically distant ASes not using reseller ports which also incur
a latency penalty. However, examining only remote peers that are geographically
distant overlooks RP through resellers. This diversity in the notion of RP led us
to evaluate RP both by (1) connection type (Reseller RP), and (2) geographical
distance to the IXP (Geographical RP).
To identify members using Reseller RP, we used ground truth that identiﬁed
members connected to an IXP using a reseller for four IXPs (Sect. 2.2). To infer
members using Geographical RP at all eight IXPs, we used the method in [15],
which uses latency measurements and empirically obtained thresholds as a proxy
of physical distance, with the following approach. For each IXP, we associated
IXP member ASes and their assigned IXP IP addresses using the datasets men-
tioned in Sect. 2.2. We performed latency measurements to these addresses on 5-6
May 2021. From each RouteViews scamper instance, we probed each interface
every two hours for two days, and used the minimum latency for each address
to account for cases of transient congestion. To ensure that the ping replies
returned directly over the peering infrastructure, we discarded measurements
where the replies had an IP-TTL value that appeared to have been decremented
(i.e., not 64 or 255). If the minimum latency from a given interface was 10 ms or
higher, we classiﬁed the member’s router as remotely connected to the IXP; a
latency of 10 ms would roughly correspond to a distance of up to 1000 km from
the IXP [33,49]. We adopted [15]’s method because its latency threshold alone
yielded accurate results for single metropolitan area peering infrastructures [27],
which is the case of the analyzed IXPs in our work (see Sect. 2.1).
To further assess the correctness of our inferences – and similar to step 2
in [27] (colocation-informed RTT interpretation) – we obtained the colocation

facilities of each of the eight analyzed IXPs in public data sources (IXP websites
and PeeringDB) and computed the distance between them. We observed that
Equinix Ashburn has the largest distance between facilities (i.e., 80 km), which
corresponds to a latency of ≈1 ms. Therefore, any IXP peer interface with latency
consistently higher than 10 ms is unlikely to be a local peer at the IXPs we
examined.
