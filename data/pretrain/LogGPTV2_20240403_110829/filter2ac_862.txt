**ATT&CK ID:** T0879  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Damage to Property

Adversaries may cause damage and destruction to infrastructure, equipment, and the surrounding environment when targeting control systems. This technique can lead to the breakdown of devices and operational equipment, or it may be a secondary effect resulting from other attack methods. The extent of physical damage and disruption to control processes and systems can vary, potentially leading to a **Loss of Safety**. Additionally, operations that result in a **Loss of Control** may also cause property damage, either directly or indirectly. Adversaries may be motivated to cause such damage to impact productivity and revenue.

### Key Points:
- **Primary Impact:** Damage and destruction of property, including infrastructure and equipment.
- **Secondary Impact:** Potential tangential damage from other attack techniques.
- **Consequences:**
  - **Loss of Safety:** Severe physical damage and disruption to control processes and systems.
  - **Loss of Control:** Can lead to further property damage, impacting productivity and revenue.
- **Motivation:** Adversaries may seek to cause damage to disrupt operations and reduce productivity, ultimately affecting the target's financial stability.
