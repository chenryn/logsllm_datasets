User: I'm using GAE remote api to access the data store of my app. The authentication to GAE is made using remote_api_stub.ConfigureRemoteApi with an authentication function that returns a user name and a password.
Is there a way for authenticating using an access_token, for example OAuth or OAuth 2.0?
Assistant: You can't use OAuth2 to connect to your app with remote_api_stub/shell. This option is not provided.
