User: I have a program in C that communicates via UDP with another program (in Java) and then does process manipulation (start/stop) based on the UDP pkt exchange.
Now this C program has been legacy and I want to convert it to Python - do you think Python will be a good choice for the tasks mentioned?
Assistant: Assuming that you have control over the environment which this application will run, and that the performance of interpreted language (python) compared to a compiled one (C) can be ignored, I believe Python is a great choice for this.
