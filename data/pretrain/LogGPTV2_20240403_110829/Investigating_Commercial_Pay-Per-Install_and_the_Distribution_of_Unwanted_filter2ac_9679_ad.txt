software that violates Google’s unwanted software pol-
icy [28]. This policy covers a subset of applications
flagged by anti-virus engines as unwanted. We map these
metrics to the PPI networks we study and find that Safe
Browsing generates over 60 million weekly download
warnings and browser interstitials. Despite these protec-
tions, telemetry Chrome users submit about their systems
indicate there are tens of million of installations of un-
wanted software, with nearly all of the top families con-
temporaneously paying for installs.
5.1 Requests for PPI Downloaders
We rely on two datasets to estimate the volume of weekly
downloads to software monetizing through Amonetize,
InstallMonetizer, OpenCandy, and Outbrowse: (1) pings
reported by browsers integrated with Safe Browsing for
downloaded binaries; and (2) Safe Browsing’s repository
of over 75 million binaries (including benign software).
When a browser integrated with Safe Browsing fetches a
binary from an untrusted source, it generates an API re-

relies on a reputation system called CAMP that builds on
incomplete data [29]. The system starts from a seed set of
3 million PPI downloaders that includes samples for all
fifteen PPI networks we outlined previously in Section 2.
From there, the system scores websites hosting these bi-
naries, common redirect paths, and related binaries. This
expands the coverage of sites and binaries involved in
pay-per-install, but results in a loss of attribution to in-
dividual PPI families. As such, we can only provide an
aggregate impact estimate.
We present the volume of PPI downloader warnings
and page-level interstitials generated by Safe Browsing
between June 1, 2015–January 7, 2016 in Figure 14 and
Figure 15 respectively. On an average week, Safe Brows-
ing raises 35 million download warnings and displays 28
million interstitials. Warnings appear as a bursty pro-
cess, in part due to the arrival of new distribution cam-
paigns and in part due to the ongoing evolutions in the
reputation of websites and binaries. In order to place un-
wanted software in the greater context of threats facing
users, we compare the volume of users encountering PPI
downloaders versus malware. On average, Safe Brows-
ing raises 13.5 million download warnings and 9 million
interstitials to protect users from malware—three times
less than that of unwanted software.
The risk of unwanted software is not localized to any
single region. We provide a breakdown of the geoloca-
tion of users shown a warning related to PPI download-
ers in Table 5. We find that Indian users account for 8%
of warnings, followed in popularity by Brazil, Vietnam,
and the United States. We find no correlation between
the price per install and geographic regions with high in-
cident rates. As such, it appears that PPI networks drive
installs to any possible user, even when the payout hovers
around $0.10 per install.
5.3 Existing Unwanted Installs
For those PPI downloaders that escape detection and
launch on a client’s machine, we estimate the number
of users potentially affected. To do this, we tap into met-
rics kept by the Chrome Cleanup Tool, an opt-in tool that
scans a user’s machine for symptoms induced by pop-
ular ad injectors, browsing settings hijackers, and sys-
tem utilities and removes offending programs [5]. Given
hundreds of potential unwanted software strains, the tool
prioritizes families based on telemetry built into Chrome
and system traces supplied by users who file Chrome
complaints due to undesirable user experiences. As part
of its execution, the tool reports which unwanted soft-
ware families it identifies as well as those successfully
removed. One limitation with the tool is that, for pri-
vacy reasons, no unique device identifier is reported per
execution. Consequently, if the tool fails to remove a un-

wanted software strain and a user re-runs the tool, they
will be counted twice. This may cause us to overesti-
mate the number of infections per family. As the Chrome
Cleanup Tool is opt-in, we caution its metrics cover only
a subset of all infected machines. While this precludes
absolute estimates on the number of unwanted software
installs, we can still estimate the relative population of
each software family.
Over the last year, the Chrome Cleanup Tool identi-
fied tens of millions of installations of unwanted soft-
ware. We present the top 15 most popular strains flagged
from January 8, 2015–January 7, 2016 in Table 6. We
measure popularity as the total installs per family divided
by all known unwanted software installs. To map these
families back to the PPI ecosystem, we mark each fam-
ily known to distribute via any of the four PPI networks
we monitor. We arrive at this determination by running
the Chrome Cleanup Tool at the completion of the bi-
nary execution phase of our analysis pipeline (described
in Section 3) to see whether the tool flagged any of the
binary’s components.

Table 5: Top 10 countries receiving the largest volume of Safe
Browsing warnings related to unwanted software.
Our results indicate that 14 of the top 15 software fam-
ilies flagged by the Chrome Cleanup Tool simultaneously
pay for installs during our monitoring. Conduit, the top
family, is a browser settings hijacker that accounts for
20.9% of all unwanted software installs reported by the
Chrome Cleanup Tool. Multiplug, the most popular ad
injector, accounts for 5.1% of installs. Our results illus-
trate the virulent affect that unwanted software found in
the PPI ecosystem has on end users. We caution we can-
not definitively say all of these installs stem from PPI2;
there are potentially other sources of installs such as di-
rect downloads via deceptive websites and advertising.
However, paired with millions of Safe Browsing warn-
ings for PPI downloaders, we argue that PPI plays a sub-
stantial role in unwanted software installation levels.
6 Distribution Techniques
We conclude our investigation with an examination of
the affiliates responsible for distributing PPI download-
ers, the landing pages they operate, and the deceptive
practices that they employ to drive installs.
6.1 Estimating PPI Affiliates
We estimate the number of affiliates participating in
Amonetize,
InstallMonetizer, OpenCandy, and Out-
browse by scanning for publisher identifiers that each
PPI downloader embeds in offer requests for account-
ing purposes. Based on the dynamic traces of roughly
1.5 million PPI downloaders provided by Safe Browsing
(discussed previously in Section 5), we estimate there are
2,518 publishers in the ecosystem, some of which may
participate in multiple PPI networks and thus should not
be considered unique. We provide a breakdown per PPI
network in Table 7. Drawing these estimates into the

Chrome Cleanup Tool cannot provide us any details for whether un-
wanted software originated from a PPI downloader.

broader context of PPI, we find a relatively small ecosys-
tem that consists of hundreds of advertisers paying for
unwanted software installs that a few thousand publish-
ers distribute. Despite the low number of actors in the
space, the end result is still millions of unwanted down-
load attempts on a weekly basis.
6.2 Landing Pages
In order to drive installs, PPI affiliates must present con-
tent that either entices or deceives a victim into down-
loading and executing a PPI downloader. We obtain
a sample of these landing pages from Safe Browsing
which monitors the entire redirect chain behind un-
wanted software delivery [27]. However, for privacy rea-
sons, our analysis is restricted to a two week period after
which these fine-grained details disappear. In total, we
sample the top 15,000 most visited landing pages from
January 18–February 1, 2016 that direct to one of the
four PPI downloaders we monitor. The sites topping this
list include large software companies like utorrent.com,
bittorrent.com, and savefrom.com (a YouTube download-
ing service); download portals like ﬁlehippo.com; and
video and media torrent sites like thepiratebay.se that
display deceptive ads that in fact link to PPI download-
ers.
In order to gain a perspective of the category of sites
involved in PPI distribution, we crawl all of the landing
pages in our sample and supply the non-HTML format-
ted text to a topic modeling algorithm similar to Gen-
sim’s implementation of LDA [13]. We present the top
10 topics in Table 8, covering 53.6% of all sampled land-

ing pages. Users searching for freeware, video games,
torrents, cracks, and even anti-virus are highly likely to
encounter PPI downloaders. Most of these sites (58%)
cater to an English audience, followed in popularity by
Russian (10%). Our results illustrate that popular down-
load portals (or their contributors) fuel a large segment of
unwanted software distribution, in turn receiving a kick-
back from PPI networks.
6.3 Distribution Pages
After a victim engages with a landing page, PPI affili-
ates redirect the victim to a distribution page that hosts
the PPI downloader. This site may be operated by the af-
filiate or directly by the PPI network, with flavors vary-
