### Figure 12: Weekly Average Price per Install for Six Regions
We observe relatively little volatility in the installation prices for the US, while there is a slight decline in rates in Europe over time.

### Software Violations and Safe Browsing Protections
Google's unwanted software policy [28] targets a subset of applications flagged by anti-virus engines as unwanted. By mapping these metrics to the Pay-Per-Install (PPI) networks under study, we find that Safe Browsing generates over 60 million weekly download warnings and browser interstitials. Despite these protections, telemetry data from Chrome users indicate that there are tens of millions of unwanted software installations, with nearly all of the top families simultaneously paying for installs.

### 5.1 Requests for PPI Downloaders
To estimate the volume of weekly downloads for software monetized through Amonetize, InstallMonetizer, OpenCandy, and Outbrowse, we rely on two datasets:
1. Pings reported by browsers integrated with Safe Browsing for downloaded binaries.
2. Safe Browsing’s repository of over 75 million binaries, including benign software.

When a browser integrated with Safe Browsing fetches a binary from an untrusted source, it generates an API request. The system, called CAMP, builds on incomplete data [29] and starts with a seed set of 3 million PPI downloaders, covering all fifteen PPI networks outlined in Section 2. This system scores websites hosting these binaries, common redirect paths, and related binaries, expanding coverage but resulting in a loss of attribution to individual PPI families. Therefore, we can only provide an aggregate impact estimate.

### 5.2 Volume of PPI Downloader Warnings and Interstitials
Figures 14 and 15 present the volume of PPI downloader warnings and page-level interstitials generated by Safe Browsing between June 1, 2015, and January 7, 2016. On average, Safe Browsing raises 35 million download warnings and displays 28 million interstitials per week. The bursty nature of these warnings is partly due to new distribution campaigns and ongoing changes in the reputation of websites and binaries.

To contextualize the threat of unwanted software, we compare the volume of users encountering PPI downloaders versus malware. On average, Safe Browsing raises 13.5 million download warnings and 9 million interstitials for malware—three times less than for unwanted software.

The risk of unwanted software is not localized to any single region. Table 5 provides a breakdown of the geolocation of users shown warnings related to PPI downloaders. Indian users account for 8% of warnings, followed by Brazil, Vietnam, and the United States. There is no correlation between the price per install and geographic regions with high incident rates, suggesting that PPI networks target any possible user, even when the payout is around $0.10 per install.

### 5.3 Existing Unwanted Installs
For PPI downloaders that evade detection and launch on a client’s machine, we estimate the number of affected users using the Chrome Cleanup Tool, an opt-in tool that scans and removes unwanted software. The tool prioritizes families based on telemetry and system traces from users who report undesirable experiences. It reports which unwanted software families it identifies and successfully removes. However, for privacy reasons, no unique device identifier is reported, leading to potential overestimation if a user re-runs the tool.

Over the last year, the Chrome Cleanup Tool identified tens of millions of unwanted software installations. Table 6 lists the top 15 most popular strains flagged from January 8, 2015, to January 7, 2016. We measure popularity as the total installs per family divided by all known unwanted software installs. To map these families back to the PPI ecosystem, we run the Chrome Cleanup Tool at the completion of the binary execution phase of our analysis pipeline (described in Section 3).

### 6 Distribution Techniques
#### 6.1 Estimating PPI Affiliates
We estimate the number of affiliates participating in Amonetize, InstallMonetizer, OpenCandy, and Outbrowse by scanning for publisher identifiers embedded in offer requests for accounting purposes. Based on dynamic traces of roughly 1.5 million PPI downloaders provided by Safe Browsing, we estimate there are 2,518 publishers in the ecosystem, some of which may participate in multiple PPI networks. Table 7 provides a breakdown per PPI network.

#### 6.2 Landing Pages
PPI affiliates must present content that entices or deceives victims into downloading and executing a PPI downloader. We obtain a sample of these landing pages from Safe Browsing, which monitors the entire redirect chain behind unwanted software delivery [27]. Our analysis is restricted to a two-week period for privacy reasons. In total, we sample the top 15,000 most visited landing pages from January 18–February 1, 2016, that direct to one of the four PPI downloaders we monitor. These sites include large software companies, download portals, and video and media torrent sites.

To categorize the types of sites involved in PPI distribution, we crawl all landing pages in our sample and use a topic modeling algorithm similar to Gensim’s LDA [13]. Table 8 presents the top 10 topics, covering 53.6% of all sampled landing pages. Users searching for freeware, video games, torrents, cracks, and even anti-virus are highly likely to encounter PPI downloaders. Most of these sites (58%) cater to an English audience, followed by Russian (10%). Our results show that popular download portals (or their contributors) play a significant role in unwanted software distribution, receiving kickbacks from PPI networks.

#### 6.3 Distribution Pages
After a victim engages with a landing page, PPI affiliates redirect them to a distribution page that hosts the PPI downloader. This site may be operated by the affiliate or directly by the PPI network, with various configurations.
