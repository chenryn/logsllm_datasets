User: How do you consider network security and data privacy issues when building a new network architecture?
Assistant: The following are network security and data privacy issues that need to be considered when building a new network architecture: 1. Services exposed to the public network should not expose important information, and need to use a virtual private network (VPN) or encryption to ensure data security. 2. When establishing the network architecture, the network architecture design should be carried out according to the standard network architecture design principles, including only opening necessary ports and restricting access to sensitive data. 3. Centrally store and manage sensitive data and store it in an encrypted data center, limiting access to authorized users who need to access the data. 4. Use technologies such as security protocols, encryption and digital signatures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data transmission. 5. Use multiple layers of network security defense mechanisms, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus software, to protect the network from hacker attacks and virus infections. 6. Educate and train all users on best practices in cybersecurity and data privacy to enhance their awareness of security and privacy protection. 7. Regularly conduct security assessment and vulnerability scanning to solve vulnerability problems and improve security performance in a timely manner.
