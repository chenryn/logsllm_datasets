User: How to communicate between containers in Docker? Please give the actual operation steps.
Assistant: In Docker, inter-container communication can be achieved in the following ways: 1. Using Docker Networks Steps: 1) Create a custom network: ``` docker network create mynetwork ``` 2) When starting a container, add it to the In the network: ``` docker run --name container1 --network mynetwork -d image1 docker run --name container2 --network mynetwork -d image2 ``` 3) Containers can communicate through container names: ``` docker exec container1 ping container2 ``` 2. Use Docker Compose Steps: 1) Write docker-compose.yml file: ``` version: '3' services: service1: image: image1 networks: - mynetwork service2: image: image2 networks : - mynetwork networks: mynetwork: ``` 2) Use docker-compose to start the container: ``` docker-compose up -d ``` 3) Containers can communicate through the service name: ``` docker exec service1 ping service2 ``` In addition, you can also use host port mapping to communicate between containers. This method is relatively simple but not flexible enough, so it is not recommended.
