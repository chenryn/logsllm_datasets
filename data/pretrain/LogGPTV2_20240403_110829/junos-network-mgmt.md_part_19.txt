In many cases, a service provider could be subject to penalties imposed by regulation, statute, or
contract if network performance is not within the bounds established for the service. One key
performance objective is delay, along with its close relative, delay variation (often called jitter). Some
applications (such as bulk file transfer) will function just as well with high delays across the network and
high delay variations, while other applications (such as voice) can function only with low and stable
delays. Many networks invoke protocols or features available at Layer 3 (the packet layer) or higher to
measure network delays and jitter link by link. However, when the network consists of many Ethernet
links, there are few protocols and features available at Layer 2 (the frame layer) that allow routers and
197
switches to measure frame delay and jitter. This is where the ability to configure and monitor Ethernet
frame delay is helpful.

Ethernet Frame Delay Measurements
You can perform Ethernet frame delay measurements (referred to as ETH-DM in Ethernet specifications)
on Juniper Networks EX Series Ethernet Switches. This feature allows you to configure on-demand
Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) statements for the measurement of frame delay and
frame delay variation (jitter). You can configure Ethernet frame delay measurement in either one-way or
two-way (round-trip) mode to gather frame delay statistics simultaneously from multiple sessions.
Ethernet frame delay measurement provides fine control to operators for triggering delay measurement
on a given service and can be used to monitor SLAs.
Ethernet frame delay measurement also collects other useful information, such as worst and best case
delays, average delay, and average delay variation. It supports software-assisted timestamping in the
receive direction for delay measurements. It also provides runtime display of delay statistics when two-
way delay measurement is triggered. Ethernet frame delay measurement records the last 100 samples
collected per remote maintenance association end point (MEP) or per connectivity fault management
(CFM) session. You can retrieve the history at any time using simple commands. You can clear all
Ethernet frame delay measurement statistics and PDU counters. Ethernet frame delay measurement is
fully compliant with the ITU-T Y.1731 (OAM Functions and Mechanisms for Ethernet-based Networks)
specification.
Ethernet frame delay measurement uses the IEEE 802.1ag CFM infrastructure.
Generally, Ethernet frame delay measurements are made in a peer fashion from one MEP or CFM
session to another. However, these measurements are not made to maintenance association
intermediate points (MIPs).
For a complete description of Ethernet frame delay measurement, see the ITU-T Y.1731 Ethernet
Service OAM topics in the Junos OS Network Interfaces Library for Routing Devices.
Types of Ethernet Frame Delay Measurements
There are two types of Ethernet frame delay measurements:
• One-way
• Two-way (round-trip)
For one-way Ethernet frame delay measurement, either MEP can send a request to begin a one-way
delay measurement to its peer MEP. However, the statistics are collected only at the receiver MEP. This
feature requires the clocks at the transmitting and receiving MEPs to be synchronized. If these clocks fall
198
out of synchronization, only one-way delay variation and average delay variation values are computed
correctly (and will, therefore, be valid). Use the show commands at the receiver MEP to display one-way
delay statistics.
For two-way (round-trip) Ethernet frame delay measurement, either MEP can send a request to begin a
two-way delay measurement to its peer MEP, which responds with timestamp information. Run-time
statistics are collected and displayed at the initiator MEP. The clocks do not need to be synchronized at
the transmitting and receiving MEPs. Junos OS supports timestamps in delay measurement reply (DMR)
frames to increase the accuracy of delay calculations.
Use the show commands at the initiator MEP to display two-way delay statistics, and at the receiver MEP
to display one-way delay statistics.
You can create an iterator profile to periodically transmit SLA measurement packets in the form of ITU-
Y.1731-compliant frames for delay measurement or loss measurement.
Limitations
The following are some limitations with regard to using Ethernet frame delay measurement:
• Ethernet frame delay measurements are available only when distributed periodic packet management
(PPM) is enabled.
• The statistics collected are lost after a graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES).
• You can monitor only one session to the same remote MEP or MAC address.
• Accuracy is compromised when the system configuration changes (such as from reconfiguration). We
recommend performing Ethernet frame delay measurements on a stable system.
Configure MEP Interfaces on Switches to Support Ethernet Frame Delay
Measurements (CLI Procedure)
Ethernet frame delay measurement is a useful tool for providing performance statistics or supporting or
challenging service-level agreements (SLAs). By default, Ethernet frame delay measurement uses
software for timestamping and delay calculations. You can configure an EX Series switch to perform and
display Ethernet frame delay measurements on Ethernet interfaces. The switches support software-
assisted timestamping.
Before you can begin configuring MEP interfaces to support Ethernet frame delay measurements on
switches, ensure that you have:
199
• Configured Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) connectivity fault management
(CFM) correctly
• Enabled distributed periodic packet management (PPM) (distributed PPM is enabled by default)
To configure MEP interfaces on switches to support Ethernet frame delay measurements:
Enable the Ethernet frame delay measurement by issuing the monitor ethernet delay-measurement
operational mode command. In this command, you must specify one measurement type (either one-way
or two-way measurement), and you must specify either the unicast MAC address of the peer MEP or its
numeric identifier.
Optionally, you can also specify the following parameters:
• Number of frames to send to the peer MEP (count count)
• Number of seconds to wait between sending frames (wait time)
• Priority value of the delay measurement request frame (priority value)
• Size of the data in the data TLV of the request packet (size value)
• Suppression of the insertion of the session ID TLV in the request packet (no-session-id-tlv)

Configure One-Way Ethernet Frame Delay Measurements on Switches
(CLI Procedure)
Ethernet frame delay measurement is a useful tool for providing performance statistics or supporting or
challenging service-level agreements (SLAs). You can configure the frame delay measurements in either a
one-way mode or a two-way (round-trip) mode to gather frame delay statistics. For one-way Ethernet
frame delay measurement, clocks at the local and remote MEPs need to be synchronized. However,
clock synchronization is not required for two-way Ethernet frame delay measurement.
Before you begin configuring one-way Ethernet frame delay measurements on two EX Series switches,
ensure that you have:
• Configured Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) connectivity fault management
(CFM) correctly on both the switches
200
• Synchronized the system clocks of both the switches
To configure one-way Ethernet frame delay measurements:
1. Configure the maintenance domain, maintenance association, and MEP ID on both the switches.
2. From either switch, start a one-way Ethernet frame delay measurement:
user@switch> monitor ethernet delay-measurement maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-
association ma-name one-way mep remote-mep-id count count wait time
You can view the result on the other switch:
user@switch> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management delay-statistics maintenance-domain
md-name maintenance-association ma-name local-mep mep-id remote-mep mep-id
Configure an Iterator Profile on a Switch (CLI Procedure)
Ethernet frame delay measurement provides fine control to operators for triggering delay measurement
on a given service and can be used to monitor service-level agreements (SLAs). You can create an
iterator profile with its parameters to periodically transmit SLA measurement packets in the form of ITU-
Y.1731-compliant frames for two-way delay measurement.
To create an iterator profile:
1. Specify a name for an SLA iterator profile—for example, i1:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring]
user@switch# edit sla-iterator-profiles i1
2. (Optional) Configure the cycle time, which is the time (in milliseconds) between back-to-back
transmissions of SLA frames.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@switch# set cycle-time cycle-time-value
201
3. (Optional) Configure the iteration period, which indicates the maximum number of cycles per
iteration (the number of connections registered to an iterator cannot exceed this value).
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@switch# set iteration-period iteration-period-value
4. Configure the measurement type as two-way delay measurement.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@switch# set measurement-type two-way-delay
5. (Optional) Configure the calculation weight for delay.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@switch# set calculation-weight delay delay-value
6. (Optional) Configure the calculation weight for delay variation.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-
iterator-profiles i1]
user@switch# set calculation-weight delay-variation delay-variation-value
7. Configure a remote MEP with the iterator profile.
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain md-name
maintenance-association ma-name mep mep-id remote-mep remote-mep-id]
user@switch# set sla-iterator-profiles i1
Trigger an Ethernet Frame Delay Measurement Session on a Switch
To trigger Ethernet frame delay measurement, use the monitor ethernet delay-measurement operational
command and specify the following values:
• Either one-way (one-way) or two-way (two-way) measurement
202
• Either the MAC address (remote-mac-address) or the MEP ID (mep) of the remote host
• The maintenance domain (maintenance-domain)
• The maintenance association (maintenance-association)
• (Optional) Any or all of these options: count, size, wait, no-session-id-tlv, priority
For example:
user@switch> monitor ethernet delay-measurement one-way 00:05:85:73:39:4a maintenance-domain md6
maintenance-association ma6 count 10 size 50 wait 5 no-session-id-tlv priority 1
Configure Two-Way Ethernet Frame Delay Measurements on Switches
(CLI Procedure)
Ethernet frame delay measurement is a useful tool for providing performance statistics or supporting or
challenging service-level agreements (SLAs). You can configure the frame delay measurements in either a
one-way mode or a two-way (round-trip) mode to gather frame delay statistics. For one-way Ethernet
frame delay measurement, clocks at the local and remote MEPs need to be synchronized. However,
clock synchronization is not required for two-way Ethernet frame delay measurement.
Before you begin configuring two-way Ethernet frame delay measurements on two EX Series switches,
ensure that you have:
• Configured Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) connectivity fault management
(CFM) correctly on both the switches
To configure two-way Ethernet frame delay measurements:
1. Configure the maintenance domain, maintenance association, and MEP ID on both the switches.
2. From either switch, start a two-way Ethernet frame delay measurement:
user@switch> monitor ethernet delay-measurement maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-
association ma-name two-way mep remote-mep-id count count wait time
203
You can view the result on the other switch:

ITU-T Y.1731 Frame Delay Measurement Feature
The IEEE 802.3-2005 standard for Ethernet Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
defines a set of link fault management mechanisms to detect and report link faults on a single point-to-
point Ethernet LAN.
Junos OS supports key OAM standards that provide for automated end-to-end management and
monitoring of Ethernet service by service providers:
• IEEE Standard 802.1ag, also known as “Connectivity Fault Management (CFM).”
• ITU-T Recommendation Y.1731, which uses different terminology than IEEE 802.1ag and defines
Ethernet service OAM features for fault monitoring, diagnostics, and performance monitoring.
These capabilities allow operators to offer binding service-level agreements (SLAs) and generate new
revenues from rate- and performance-guaranteed service packages that are tailored to the specific
needs of their customers.
ACX Series routers support proactive and on-demand modes.
206
You can configure ITU-T Y.1731 standard-compliant Ethernet loss measurement (ETH-LM), Ethernet
synthetic loss measurement (ETH-SLM), and Ethernet delay measurement (ETH- DM) capabilities on
MPC10 and MPC11 line cards on 20.2R2-S3 only and 20.4R1 onwards.
NOTE: ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers supports only software-based time stamping for delay
measurement.
Ethernet CFM
The IEEE 802.1ag standard for connectivity fault management (CFM) defines mechanisms to provide for
end-to-end Ethernet service assurance over any path, whether a single link or multiple links spanning
networks composed of multiple LANs.
For Ethernet interfaces on M320, MX Series, and T Series routers, Junos OS supports the following key
elements of the Ethernet CFM standard:
• Fault monitoring using the IEEE 802.1ag Ethernet OAM Continuity Check protocol
• Path discovery and fault verification using the IEEE 802.1ag Ethernet OAM Linktrace protocol
• Fault isolation using the IEEE 802.1ag Ethernet OAM Loopback protocol
In a CFM environment, network entities such as network operators, service providers, and customers
may be part of different administrative domains. Each administrative domain is mapped into one
maintenance domain. Maintenance domains are configured with different level values to keep them
separate. Each domain provides enough information for the entities to perform their own management
and end-to-end monitoring, and still avoid security breaches.
Figure 18 on page 207 shows the relationships among the customer, provider, and operator Ethernet
bridges, maintenance domains, maintenance association end points (MEPs), and maintenance
intermediate points (MIPs).
207
Figure 18: Relationship of MEPs, MIPs, and Maintenance Domain Levels
NOTE: On ACX Series routers, the maintenance intermediate points (MIP) is supported only on
the ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers.
Ethernet Frame Delay Measurement
Two key objectives of OAM functionality are to measure quality-of-service attributes such as frame
delay and frame delay variation (also known as “frame jitter”). Such measurements can enable you to
identify network problems before customers are impacted by network defects.
Junos OS supports Ethernet frame delay measurement between MEPs configured on Ethernet physical
or logical interfaces on MX Series routers. Ethernet frame delay measurement provides fine control to
operators for triggering delay measurement on a given service and can be used to monitor SLAs.
Ethernet frame delay measurement also collects other useful information, such as worst and best case
delays, average delay, and average delay variation. The Junos OS implementation of Ethernet frame
delay measurement (ETH-DM) is fully compliant with the ITU-T Recommendation Y.1731, OAM
Functions and Mechanisms for Ethernet-based Networks. The recommendation defines OAM
mechanisms for operating and maintaining the network at the Ethernet service layer, which is called the
"ETH layer" in ITU-T terminology.
MX Series routers with modular port concentrators (MPCs) and 10-Gigabit Ethernet MPCs with SFP+
support ITU-T Y.1731 functionality on VPLS for frame-delay and delay-variation.
NOTE: MX Series Virtual Chassis does not support Ethernet frame delay measurement (DM).
208
One-Way Ethernet Frame Delay Measurement
In one-way ETH-DM mode, a series of frame delay and frame delay variation values are calculated
based on the time elapsed between the time a measurement frame is sent from the initiator MEP at one
router and the time when the frame is received at the receiver MEP at the other router.
NOTE: ACX Series routers do not support one-way Ethernet frame delay measurement.
1DM Transmission
When you start a one-way frame delay measurement, the router sends 1DM frames—frames that carry
the protocol data unit (PDU) for a one-way delay measurement—from the initiator MEP to the receiver
MEP at the rate and for the number of frames you specify. The router marks each 1DM frame as drop-
ineligible and inserts a timestamp of the transmission time into the frame.
1DM Reception
When an MEP receives a 1DM frame, the router that contains the receiver MEP measures the one-way
delay for that frame (the difference between the time the frame was received and the timestamp
contained in the frame itself) and the delay variation (the difference between the current and previous
delay values).
One-Way ETH-DM Statistics
The router that contains the receiver MEP stores each set of one-way delay statistics in the ETH-DM
database. The ETH-DM database collects up to 100 sets of statistics for any given CFM session (pair of
peer MEPs). You can access these statistics at any time by displaying the ETH-DM database contents.
One-Way ETH-DM Frame Counts
Each router counts the number of one-way ETH-DM frames sent and received:
• For an initiator MEP, the router counts the number of 1DM frames sent.
• For a receiver MEP, the router counts the number of valid 1DM frames received and the number of
invalid 1DM frames received.
Each router stores ETH-DM frame counts in the CFM database. The CFM database stores CFM session
statistics and, for interfaces that support ETH-DM, any ETH-DM frame counts. You can access the
frame counts at any time by displaying CFM database information for Ethernet interfaces assigned to
MEPs or for MEPs in CFM sessions.
209
Synchronization of System Clocks
The accuracy of one-way delay calculations depends on close synchronization of the system clocks at
the initiator MEP and receiver MEP.
The accuracy of one-way delay variation is not dependent on system clock synchronization. Because
delay variation is simply the difference between consecutive one-way delay values, the out-of-phase
period is eliminated from the frame jitter values.
NOTE: For a given one-way Ethernet frame delay measurement, frame delay and frame delay
variation values are available only on the router that contains the receiver MEP.
Two-Way Ethernet Frame Delay Measurement
In two-way ETH-DM mode, frame delay and frame delay variation values are based on the time
difference between when the initiator MEP transmits a request frame and receives a reply frame from
the responder MEP, subtracting the time elapsed at the responder MEP.
DMM Transmission
When you start a two-way frame delay measurement, the router sends delay measurement message
(DMM) frames— frames that carry the PDU for a two-way ETH-DM request—from the initiator MEP to
the responder MEP at the rate and for the number of frames you specify. The router marks each DMM
frame as drop-ineligible and inserts a timestamp of the transmission time into the frame.
DMR Transmission
When an MEP receives a DMM frame, the responder MEP responds with a delay measurement reply
(DMR) frame, which carries ETH-DM reply information and a copy of the timestamp contained in the
DMM frame.
DMR Reception
When an MEP receives a valid DMR, the router that contains the MEP measures the two-way delay for
that frame based on the following sequence of timestamps:
1. TI
TxDMM
2. TR
RxDMM
3. TR
TxDMR
210
4. TI
RxDMR
A two-way frame delay is calculated as follows:
1. [TI – TI ] – [TR – TR ]
RxDMR TxDMM TxDMR RxDMM
The calculation show that frame delay is the difference between the time at which the initiator MEP
sends a DMM frame and the time at which the initiator MEP receives the associated DMR frame from
the responder MEP, minus the time elapsed at the responder MEP.
The delay variation is the difference between the current and previous delay values.
Two-Way ETH-DM Statistics
The router that contains the initiator MEP stores each set of two-way delay statistics in the ETH-DM
database. The ETH-DM database collects up to 100 sets of statistics for any given CFM session (pair of
peer MEPs). You can access these statistics at any time by displaying the ETH-DM database contents.
Two-Way ETH-DM Frame Counts
Each router counts the number of two-way ETH-DM frames sent and received:
• For an initiator MEP, the router counts the number DMM frames transmitted, the number of valid
DMR frames received, and the number of invalid DMR frames received.
