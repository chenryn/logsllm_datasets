### 4.1 Monthly Usage Trends

Figure 3 illustrates the average monthly usage for TIP, TDP, and control users over a one-year period (March 2012 to February 2013). The data is fitted with a linear trendline to show the general trend. We observe that usage generally increases for both TIP and control users, which aligns with the growing amounts of mobile data traffic. However, TDP users' usage remains anomalously flat. During the June 2013 trial period, the control group's usage fits the established trend. In contrast, TIP users experience a significant decrease in usage, while TDP users see a slight increase compared to the trendline predictions. This suggests that TIP users reduce their usage during the trial, while TDP users increase their usage. These findings and their psychological causes are discussed in Section 5.

### 4.2 Distribution of Usage Among Apps

Table 2 presents the fraction of mobile (cellular) and WiFi usage attributed to the top 10 apps. Many of the same apps appear in both categories. Facebook and Android’s media process are the top two apps for both interfaces. Pandora, web browsing, email, and iFunny also rank among the top seven apps for both WiFi and mobile usage. Mobile usage is more evenly distributed among apps, with the top 10 apps comprising 63.1% of mobile and 78.0% of WiFi usage. Apps outside the top 10 each account for less than 2% of usage.

Figure 4 shows the hourly usage patterns for the top four apps on both mobile and WiFi. WiFi usage is generally higher in the evenings, likely due to people being at home and having access to WiFi. While most apps have similar usage patterns, there are some differences. For example, Pandora is primarily used between 5 AM and 3 PM on mobile, peaking around 10 AM. Android’s media process, used for streaming videos, shows high peaks for both mobile and WiFi usage, reflecting its high bandwidth requirements.

### 5. Pricing Effects

In this section, we present the results of the pricing trial. We use the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of hourly usage over a day to measure the degree to which ISPs must over-provision their network. A higher PAR indicates that the ISP’s network has more idle capacity, as it is provisioned for higher peak capacity than needed on average. Before the trial, TIP and TDP users had an average PAR of 1.88, indicating that the peak hourly traffic was almost twice the mean.

**TIP Users:**
- Decrease their total usage to remain below their data caps.
- Increase their mobile usage’s PAR.
- May increase their overall WiFi usage.

**TDP Users:**
- Increase their usage in response to price discounts.
- Allow ISPs to reduce their PAR by up to 31.4% with profit-maximizing prices.

Larger sample sizes with a broader population may yield different top apps.
