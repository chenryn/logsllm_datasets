substantial minority (34.1 %) of control users use less than 1MB per day, none
of these users volunteered for our TIP or TDP trial groups.
Users’ average daily usage changes over time. Figure 3 shows the average daily
usage in each month over one year (March 2012–February 2013), ﬁtted with a
linear trendline. We see that usage generally increases for TIP and control users,
as is consistent with the growing amounts of mobile data traﬃc, but remains
anomalously ﬂat for TDP users. Usage observed during the June 2013 trial period
ﬁts this trend for the control group. However, the TIP users see a large decrease
and the TDP users a slight increase in usage compared to that predicted by
the trendlines. Thus, TIP users decrease their usage and TDP users increase
their usage during the trial. We examine these ﬁndings and their psychological
causes in Sect. 5.
4.2 How Is Usage Distributed Among Apps?
Table 2 shows the fraction of mobile (cellular) and WiFi usage corresponding
to the top 10 apps. Many of the same apps appear for mobile and WiFi, with

Fig. 4. Mean hourly usage for the top 4 apps.
Facebook and Android’s media process the number 1 and number 2 apps for both
interfaces. Pandora, web browsing, email, and iFunny also appear in the top 7
apps for both WiFi and mobile usage.3 Mobile usage is more evenly distributed
among apps than is WiFi usage, with the top 10 apps comprising 63.1 % of
mobile and 78.0 % of WiFi usage. Apps outside the top 10 each accounted for
less than 2 % of usage.
Figure 4 shows the hourly usage of the top four apps for mobile and WiFi. We
see that WiFi is generally used more in the evenings, likely because people are
at home then and have WiFi connectivity there. While most apps have generally
similar usage patterns, there are some diﬀerences: Pandora, for instance, is only
used between 5am and 3pm on mobile and peaks around 10am. Android’s media
process, which is used by other apps to stream videos, shows high peaks for
mobile and WiFi usage, likely due to its high bandwidth requirements.
5 Pricing Eﬀects
In this section, we present the trial results. Throughout the discussion, we use the
peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of hourly usage over a day to measure the degree
to which ISPs must over-provision their network. A higher PAR indicates that
the ISP’s network has more idle capacity, as it is provisioned for higher peak
capacity than is needed on average. Before the trial, TIP and TDP users had an
average PAR of 1.88, indicating that the peak hourly traﬃc was almost twice
the mean.
We ﬁrst show that TIP users decrease their total usage to remain below their
data caps, but increase their mobile usage’s PAR and may increase their over-
all WiFi usage. TDP users increase their usage in response to price discounts,
allowing ISPs to reduce their PAR by up to 31.4 % with proﬁt-maximizing
prices.
3 Larger sample sizes with a broader population may yield diﬀerent top apps.
