### Title: Unmasking the Cyber Mercenary: Attributing Campaigns of Void Balaur

In this presentation, we delve into the activities of a cyber mercenary known as "Void Balaur." Unlike traditional security firms, Void Balaur operates in the shadows, advertising its services on underground forums such as Probiv. Our investigation, which spans from 2016 to 2021, reveals the significant impact of their campaigns, particularly in countries like Uzbekistan and Belarus.

Our attention was first drawn to Void Balaur in the spring of 2020 when we were contacted by a frequent target of Pawn Storm (APT28). This individual's spouse had received multiple phishing emails, and he sought to identify the sender. We quickly linked these phishing attempts to Void Balaur but required an additional six months of research to achieve high-confidence attribution.

Leveraging billions of passive DNS records and Trend Micro's telemetry, we identified numerous targets and related campaigns between 2016 and 2019. Some of these campaigns had been previously reported by Amnesty International (2020) and eQualit.ie (2019), though without attribution. In the fall of 2020, we discovered that someone was using the eleos.tk VPN network to access Void Balaur's control panels, which lacked any form of authentication. This breakthrough allowed us to attribute both past and present campaigns with high confidence.

Our investigation uncovered over 1,000 targets, including oligarchs, CEOs, politicians, and human rights activists. Some of these individuals were forced to flee their home countries due to the threats posed by Void Balaur. We also found a small but significant overlap with the targeting patterns of Pawn Storm, indicating that political and corporate espionage motivated actors have sought out the services of this cyber mercenary.

Given the lack of international regulations to protect targets of cyber mercenaries, we will discuss practical measures that journalists, human rights activists, and other potential targets can take to better safeguard themselves against APT attackers and cyber mercenaries.
