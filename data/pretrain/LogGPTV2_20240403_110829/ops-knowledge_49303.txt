User: I'm putting several tasks into a task queue and would like to know when the specific tasks are done. I haven't found anything in the API about call backs, or checking the status of a task, so I thought I'd see what other people do, or if there's a work around (or official) way to check. I don't care about individual tasks, if it helps, I'm putting 6 different tasks in, and want to know when all 6 are complete.
Thanks!
Assistant: You can use memcache.  Use a unique key specific to this task group.  Set a count when you kick off your tasks, and have each task atomically decrement it.  When the value is 0, your tasks are complete.  The task that finds this value to be 0 can call your callback.
