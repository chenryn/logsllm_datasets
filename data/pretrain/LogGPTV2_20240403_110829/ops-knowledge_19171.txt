User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Kickstart based installation of RHEL 6.4 from USB I want to setup some brand new servers with RHEL 6.4. Servers do not have DVD, so, I have to use USB for the installation.
I already have a custom ISO with a kickstart file that I use on servers with DVD flawlessly. I used iso2usb to move the ISO το my USB. 

When I boot from the USB, the ks file is found, anaconda starts, but then stops with the following error:

"The installation source given by device ['sda1'] could not be found. Please check your parameters and try again"

Notes:


The USB IS the sda. 
My custom ISO file is renamed to linux.iso from iso2usb and it is present in the root directory of the USB.


Kickstart file has the following entry:
harddrive --partition=sda1 --dir=/



Please help me to automate the installation with kickstart.



Edit 1:
This the anaconda.log file:

Edit 2:
This is the part of anaconda log that indicates that it found the USB etc:

Assistant: Check your ISO file content whether it has .discinfo and .treeinfo at the root path.

I used to face this problem on RHEL 6.3 as I customize the ISO and forgot to copy these file to the root path before burning the ISO.
