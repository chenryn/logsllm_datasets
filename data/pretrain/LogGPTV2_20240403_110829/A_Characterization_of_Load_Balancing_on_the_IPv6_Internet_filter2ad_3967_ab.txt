probe identiﬁers in the TCP sequence number ﬁeld.
We execute MDA between each source and destination pair. Each execution
varies the four gray ﬁelds in Fig. 2. This lets us identify load balancers and which
header ﬁelds they use when computing a probe’s ﬂow identiﬁer. At each hop,
we probe with up to 256 diﬀerent ﬂow identiﬁers, a limitation imposed by the
8 bits available in the traﬃc class ﬁeld and in the destination address. Having 256
diﬀerent ﬂow identiﬁers lets MDA identify up to 39 distinct next hops at the
chosen α = 0.95 conﬁdence level; 256 probes were enough for 99.99% of the hops
measured.
4 Dataset
We collect IPv6 route measurements4 from 7 vantage points on CAIDA’s Ark
platform and from 5 vantage points on the Linode cloud hosting service, as shown
on Table 1. The vantage points are spread across 7 countries in 3 continents. Each
vantage point measures routes to a list of 51927 destinations built by sampling
two addresses from each /48 preﬁx in a hitlist of 700 thousand IPv6 addresses by
Gasser et al. [9]. The dataset was collected on Ark from August 29th to October
3rd, 2016; and on Linode from September 12th to October 3rd, 2016. We chose
these platforms because, at the time of writing, PlanetLab does not support
IPv6 and RIPE Atlas does not support MDA.
We discard MDA measurements that have loops at the interface level or that
do not observe any router (less than 1% of measurements). We do consider MDA
measurements that do not reach the destination up to the furthest hop common
to all four MDA runs toward that destination. We look at IP interfaces and do
not perform IP-to-router aliasing; as a result, one (physical) router might be
counted multiple times (once for each interface we measure).
For IPv6 to AS mapping we use the AS mapping database provided by Team
Cymru.5 To better understand load balancing behavior, we also queried reverse
DNS entries (PTR records) for IPv6 addresses in our measurements.

properties (Sect. 5.3). Finally, we discuss some IPv6-speciﬁc confounding factors
(Sect. 5.4). Our results mostly match previous reports on the IPv4 Internet, but
we discuss a few punctual diﬀerences.
5.1 Load Balancing Prevalence
Table 1 shows the fraction of routes from each vantage point that traverse a load
balancer (‘Overall’ column). We ﬁnd load balancing is prevalent in IPv6 routes.
The heterogeneity among vantage points can be explained by load balancers one
or two hops upstream of some of the vantage points (marked with a (cid:3)). In the case
of Linode, these load balancers are inside Linode’s own network (as identiﬁed by
IP-to-AS mapping). These load balancers appear on most routes and signiﬁcantly
impact observations. To remove the impact of these load balancers, we also show
the fraction of routes traversing a load balancer when we ignore load balancers
two IP hops upstream of vantage points if they are on the same (origin) AS
(‘Filtered’ column). After ﬁltering we observe more homogeneous prevalence of
load balancing across vantage points. The ﬁltered results give a better picture
of load balancing on IPv6 transit networks and might be representative of other
vantage points. We ﬁnd that of the 45% of routes that traverse a Tier-1 AS, as
identiﬁed by CAIDA’s AS-relationship inference algorithm [10], 29% traverse a
load balancer inside the Tier-1.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of the number of load balancers over all routes
in our dataset for each platform. We ﬁnd routes traverse multiple load balancers.
(Note that one hop can have multiple load balancers, e.g., hop 2 in Fig. 1.) In
particular, 76% of Linode routes traverse three or more load balancers. This
is because routes often traverse three load balancers in Linode’s network (see
248
R. Almeida et al.
Fig. 3. Load balancers
Fig. 4. Number of diamonds
‘Diamond 1’ in Fig. 1). Figure 3 also shows the number of load balancers traversed
when we ignore load balancers two IP hops upstream of vantage points if they
are on the same (origin) AS (dotted lines). After ﬁltering, we observe similar
load balancing from Ark and Linode vantage points.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of the number of diamonds over all routes in
our dataset. As diamonds start and end on interfaces that all packets traverse,
the number of diamonds on a route gives a lower bound of the number of load
balancers that packets traverse to reach the destination. Although Fig. 3 shows
routes can traverse many load balancers, these are grouped into a small number
of diamonds. As we will show later (Sect. 5.3), diamonds are complex and contain
many load balancers. This result is similar to previous results for IPv4 load
balancing [1].
5.2 Classes of Load Balancing Behavior
We now investigate what IPv6 header ﬁelds load balancers use to compute
ﬂow identiﬁers to choose next hops. We identify load balancers by their IPv6
addresses. Table 2 shows the fraction of load balancers in each class and the
percentage of routes that traverse at least one load balancer in each class. We
also report results from Augustin et al. [1] for IPv4 load balancers. (Note that
Augustin’s results are from 2011, so the diﬀerences we discuss might also be due
to network evolution and not only IP version).
We ﬁnd per-destination, per-ﬂow, and per-packet load balancers are not only
the most common load balancer classes, but also the most prevalent across route
measurements. This is expected, as these classes were used for IPv4 load bal-
ancing. Despite this similarity, we observe a signiﬁcantly higher fraction of IPv6
routes traverse per-packet load balancers. We discuss this further in Sect. 5.4.
We also ﬁnd other classes of load balancers. We ﬁnd 3.2% of load balancers
perform per-ﬂow load balancing considering the traﬃc class ﬁeld (in addition to
the destination address and source port). This behavior is the default in at least
JunOS 15.1. We could not ﬁnd any reports on how many IPv4 load balancers

consider the TOS ﬁeld to compare. Interestingly, we ﬁnd 6% of load balancers
that use only the TCP ports for load balancing. We manually investigated these
load balancers and found this behavior can be conﬁgured in RouterOS under
the name of “per-application load balancing.” Perhaps surprisingly, we ﬁnd only
0.8% of load balancers that consider IPv6’s ﬂow label (with or without other
ﬁelds). Overall, 4% of the load balancers consider either IPv6’s traﬃc class or ﬂow
label ﬁelds.
5.3 Diamond Characteristics
We now characterize diamonds on routes with load balancing using the same
methodology and metrics as Augustin et al. [1] and compare the observations.
Diamond length. Figure 5 shows the distribution of diamond lengths. We ﬁnd
diamonds are usually short, and that load balancers one or two hops upstream
of vantage points have longer diamonds than average. If we ignore these load
balancers (dashed lines), then both datasets observe very similar distributions
