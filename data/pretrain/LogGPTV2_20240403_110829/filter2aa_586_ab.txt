Attacking a client using SIP service
• Caller ID spoofed messages  
• to install a malicious application or an SSL certificate 
• to redirect voicemails or calls 
• Fake caller ID for Scam, Vishing or Spying 
• Manipulate the content or content-type on messaging 
• Trigger a crash/BoF on the remote client 
• Inject cross-site scripting to the conversation

Attacking a client using SIP trust
• SIP server redirects a few fields to client 
• FROM, FROM NAME, Contact  
• Other fields depend on server (e.g. SDP, MIME) 
• Message content 
• Clients have buffer overflow in FROM? 
• Send 2000 chars to test it ! 
• Crash it or execute your shellcode if available 
• Clients trust SIP servers and trust is UDP based 
• Trust hacking module can be used for the trust between 
server and client too. 
• Viproy Penetration Testing Kit SIP Modules 
• Simple fuzz support (FROM=FUZZ 2000) 
• You can modify it for further attacks
