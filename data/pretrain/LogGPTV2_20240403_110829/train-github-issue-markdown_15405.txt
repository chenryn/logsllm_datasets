Dear Neo4j team,  
I have a issue when i'm trying to use NOT IN expressions
    This is my use case:
    - The first query, i get nodes that have relationship with cypher
    start cypher=node(4) 
    match cypher-[:KNOWS]-friends 
    return friends
    Expect result: node 2 and node 5
    Actual result: node 2 and node 5. This query run pretty good.
    - The second query, i inherit the first query but i want to exclude node 5  
    start cypher=node(4) 
    match cypher-[:KNOWS]-friends 
    where NOT (ID(friends) IN [5]) 
    return friends
    Expect result: node 2
    Actual result: "Error: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.RuntimeException"
    Please try above use cases on http://tinyurl.com/bn35krt 
    Thanks!
