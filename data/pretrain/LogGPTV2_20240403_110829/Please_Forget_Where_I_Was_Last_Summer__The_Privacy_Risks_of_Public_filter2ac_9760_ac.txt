### Methodology for Identifying Home and Work Locations in Tweets

#### Data Preprocessing
The initial step involved manually inspecting the content of tweets, with references to other users (i.e., tokens starting with “@”) removed. We began by identifying users who explicitly mentioned being at home in their tweets, using phrases such as “I’m home” or “at home.” After clustering these tweets, we manually reviewed all tweets within these clusters, considering the context to ensure that they genuinely referred to the user’s home. Instead of identifying work clusters for other users, we focused on users whose home locations were already identified, allowing us to create a more comprehensive dataset that includes both home and work locations.

#### Manual Inspection Workflow
To establish a high-confidence methodology for labeling home and work locations, we followed a rigorous process:

1. **Content Analysis and Labeling:**
   - Two researchers independently analyzed and labeled the tweets.
   - In cases where the labels did not match, the user was discarded to maintain strict accuracy requirements.
   - Ambiguous or uncertain instances were also excluded.

2. **Detailed Workflow:**
   - **Step 1:** Inspect tweets containing seed phrases (e.g., “I’m home,” “at work”) and the remaining tweets in the cluster. This allowed us to identify explicit and implicit references to home or work. For implicit references, at least two such tweets were required.
   - **Step 2:** Manually inspect the 10 largest clusters of each user to identify multiple homes or work locations. If no additional clusters indicated a home or work location, the original label was confirmed. If other clusters suggested potential key locations, further analysis was conducted:
     - **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze the timeline of clusters to identify active periods and detect changes in residence or secondary homes (e.g., summer houses).
     - **Spatial Analysis:** For clusters with overlapping active periods, consider the geographical proximity. Close clusters were further investigated to determine the primary home, while distant clusters were verified based on content.

#### Dataset Statistics
- **Home-Top Dataset:**
  - 1,004 users with 1,307 home clusters.
  - 718 users have one home cluster, 269 have two, and 17 have three.
- **Home-Low Dataset:**
  - 1,043 users with 1,043 home clusters.
  - 905 users have one home cluster, 137 have two, and 1 has three.
- **Work-Top and Work-Low Datasets:**
  - 298 and 92 users with 363 and 98 work clusters, respectively.

#### Experimental Evaluation
- **Location Clusters:**
  - Highly active users tend to have more clusters, with 50% having over 140 clusters.
  - Less active users have fewer but follow a similar pattern.
  - The majority of users have a large number of small clusters, which are important for privacy concerns.

- **Performance of LPAuditor:**
  - **Home Inference:**
    - Precision: 92.23% (Home-Top), 92.9% (Home-Low).
  - **Work Inference:**
    - Precision: 55.03% (Work-Top), 57.6% (Work-Low).

- **Cluster Ranks:**
  - Home clusters are typically rank 1, while work clusters are often rank 2 or lower.

- **Selection Bias:**
  - A random subset of 100 users from the main datasets was manually verified, showing comparable accuracy to the ground truth.

- **De-anonymization:**
  - An exploratory experiment identified 183 pseudonymous users, with LPAuditor correctly identifying the home location for 171 and the workplace for 23.

#### Conclusion
Our methodology, validated through rigorous manual inspection and systematic analysis, ensures high confidence in the labeled home and work locations. The resulting ground truth datasets are more complete and fine-grained than previous work, providing a robust foundation for evaluating location inference systems like LPAuditor.
