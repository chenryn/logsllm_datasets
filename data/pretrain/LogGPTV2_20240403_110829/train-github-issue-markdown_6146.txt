`index.js` file in all of `bower-angular-*` repositories has a syntax error:
    require('./angular-sanitize');
    module.exports = angular-sanitize;
(link)
Which makes it a bit more complicated to use them with browserify. I couldn't
find the script that's used to generate those repos, but the fix would be as
simple as rewriting the file to:
    module.exports = require('./angular-sanitize');
Another option would be to add `"main":"angular-sanitize.js"` to
`package.json` (spec) and not have an `index.js` file at all (as it's already
done in `bower.json`).
