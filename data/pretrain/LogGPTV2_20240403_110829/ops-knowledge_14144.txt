User: What are cloud native technologies, what problems do they solve, and what are their core components?
Assistant: Cloud native technologies are a set of modern methods and technologies for building and running distributed applications, including containerization, microservices, automation, agile development, and continuous delivery. It is designed to improve application scalability, resiliency, observability, and security, and to support rapid delivery and continuous innovation. Cloud-native technology solves some problems of traditional application deployment and maintenance, such as: 1. Scalability issues: Cloud-native technology can easily expand applications to cope with changing business needs. 2. Dependency issues: Cloud native technologies can containerize applications and their dependencies, making them more portable and reliable. 3. Reliability issues: Cloud native technology can improve the reliability and elasticity of applications through microservice architecture and automated operation and maintenance. 4. Security issues: Cloud-native technologies can provide stronger security controls and vulnerability management to protect applications and data. The core components of cloud native technology include: 1. Docker: an open source containerization platform that can encapsulate applications and dependencies into independent containers. 2. Kubernetes: A popular open source container orchestration system for managing and orchestrating operations such as deployment, expansion, and updates of containerized applications. 3. Istio: An open source platform for managing microservice network communication, providing functions such as traffic control, security, observability, and failure recovery. 4. Prometheus: A popular open source monitoring system for collecting, storing and presenting application metrics and monitoring data.
