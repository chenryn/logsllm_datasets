### 3.4.5 Cryptocurrency and Its Growing Appeal

While identified cases of money laundering through cryptocurrencies remain relatively small compared to traditional cash-based methods, the trend is on the rise. In one significant case, a major cybercrime group was estimated to have converted stolen funds from ATM cashouts into cryptocurrency. The increasing availability of alternative cryptocurrencies that offer greater anonymity, along with services like mixers and tumblers that obscure the source of funds by blending them with large amounts of other funds, enhances the appeal of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities.

In a notable case leading to arrests and prosecutions, authorities discovered 15,000 bitcoins valued at USD$109 million, two sports cars, and jewelry worth USD$557,000 at the residence of the group leader. The group operated internationally: the bitcoin farm where they mined cryptocurrency to launder stolen funds was located in an industrial building in East Asia, while many of the arrested members were from Eastern Europe. The leader enjoyed the benefits of the stolen funds in Western Europe.

For heavily sanctioned territories, such as FATF high-risk jurisdictions, cryptocurrency provides an alternative income stream to targeting banks and financial institutions. The Lazarus Group, for example, has utilized East Asian facilitators to launder funds after heists at cryptocurrency exchanges, using techniques similar to those employed in bank heists. The process typically involves the following steps:

- **Theft and Layering**: The Lazarus Group steals funds in cryptocurrency from an exchange and distributes the stolen cryptocurrency across multiple exchanges as a layering technique.
- **Facilitator Involvement**: East Asian facilitators, working on behalf of the Lazarus Group, receive a portion of the stolen funds.
- **Further Obfuscation**: The facilitators transfer the cryptocurrency across various addresses to further obfuscate the origin of the funds.
- **Conversion to Fiat Currency**: A portion of the received funds is moved through newly added bank accounts linked to their exchange accounts, enabling the conversion from cryptocurrency to fiat currency. Other stolen funds might be transferred in Bitcoin to prepaid gift cards, which can be used at other exchanges to purchase additional Bitcoin.

A detailed example of the Lazarus Group's money laundering methods is provided by a cyber-theft at a cryptocurrency exchange in June 2018, resulting in the theft of USD$30 million in various crypto-assets. Subsequently, almost 2,000 Bitcoin was moved into a cryptocurrency exchange in Eastern Europe over four days, involving 68 transactions. This strategic pattern of transactions is consistent with an attempt to circumvent an exchange’s anti-money laundering (AML) controls, including red flags associated with transaction limits.

### 3.4.6 Prepaid Cryptocurrency Cards

Cybercriminals may use cryptocurrency to obfuscate and launder funds stolen during a cyber-heist before making various purchases to integrate the funds. In this scenario, cybercriminals might launder the stolen funds at a bitcoin farm and then use financial platforms to load prepaid cards with Bitcoin. Prepaid cryptocurrency cards facilitate the reversion of cryptocurrency back into fiat currency in small amounts. This technique exploits a loophole where the original financial institution issues the card in conjunction with the card issuer’s partner, which receives and converts the funds from cryptocurrency into fiat currency.

Stolen money from several cyber-heists has been laundered via cryptocurrencies using prepaid cards linked to cryptocurrency wallets. Financial platforms in Europe and the UK have been used to load prepaid cards with Bitcoin, which were subsequently used to purchase jewelry, cars, and property with stolen funds. These assets are sometimes resold as a further step in the money laundering process.

### 3.4.7 Converting Cryptocurrency into Tangible Assets

The emergence of online marketplaces offers effective methods for converting cryptocurrencies into tangible assets that can be held anonymously or sold as an additional step in laundering the proceeds of a cyber-heist. Dedicated sites facilitate the purchase of high-end land and property assets, including luxury penthouses and tropical islands, as well as watches, jewelry, gold bars, and fine art. The concern for the financial system is that these digital transactions are conducted in a peer-to-peer manner, circumventing the checks and processes by banks, and often require only an email address to make the purchase. This means that funds acquired through criminal means can be kept concealed.

### 4. Mitigation of Money Laundering Risks

#### 4.1 Information Sharing Technologies

A central initiative to empower banks to better detect illicit activity is to provide them with more visibility into a larger pool of data. This includes enhancing public-private sharing initiatives to foster timely exchanges between financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, as well as among financial institutions. In 2017, SWIFT created a global information sharing initiative, establishing a dedicated Customer Security Intelligence (CSI) team to investigate cyber incidents experienced by its customers and introduced a ‘SWIFT ISAC’ information sharing portal to share threat intelligence across the SWIFT member community.

Without amendments to legal and regulatory frameworks to enable banks to embrace advances in technology and data science for safe AML information sharing, identifying illicit behavior will remain in their blind spot until it is too late. Public-private partnerships to aid in information sharing between financial institutions and law enforcement have been largely successful. There are also many technologies for enhancing information sharing between banks, including the use of machine learning to enrich and improve transaction and account monitoring programs. One approach being investigated by several banks is the use of Privacy Enhancing Technology, including homomorphic encryption, to allow queries to be run by one organization on encrypted or open datasets held by other organizations in a privacy-enhancing manner.

#### 4.2 Augmented Sharing of Risk Factors Pertaining to FATF High-Risk Jurisdictions

Thorough investigations have been conducted into FATF high-risk jurisdictions conducting illicit practices via front companies in East Asia to evade sanctions and launder monies. However, there is a need to distill and disseminate key findings from these investigations across the international financial system. This will enable institutions to be more agile in identifying transactions related to nefarious activity linked to a FATF high-risk jurisdiction and trigger the need for enhanced due diligence. This includes recognizing the presence of front companies in East Asia and the associated red flags that should alert suspicion.

Given the activity of some diplomats from FATF high-risk jurisdictions using accounts in the names of family members to evade sanctions and assist money laundering, these names could be shared with financial institutions to screen against as part of KYC and enhanced due diligence processes, as long as it is permitted by data protection and legal frameworks in various jurisdictions. Similarly, augmented sharing of the red flags and situational circumstances that led to the successful arrest of individuals involved in the laundering stages of a cyber-heist could greatly increase awareness and agility in financial institutions and law enforcement agencies across various jurisdictions, ultimately reducing vulnerabilities. Standard-setting organizations and regional Fraud Intelligence Units could be effective conduits for such risk-mitigating information sharing.

#### 4.3 Money-Mule Initiatives

The essential role of money mules in facilitating successful cyber-heists and enabling criminals to separate themselves from the fraud and money laundering stages makes it a critical focus area for risk mitigation. Numerous government, policing, and industry initiatives have been launched, including:

- **European Money Mule Action**: Coordinated actions by Europol’s Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), Eurojust, and the European Banking Federation support this initiative.
- **Don’t Be Fooled Campaign**: Cifas, the UK’s fraud prevention service, and Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK) launched this campaign to deter young people, particularly students, from becoming money mules.
- **U.S. DOJ Initiative**: In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and federal, state, and international law enforcement partners announced a concentrated effort to halt money-mule activity and shut down enterprises that exploit the most vulnerable in society. The initiative aims to end the conduct of money mules and execute search warrants to secure evidence from those who knowingly aided and abetted fraud schemes.

The success of funds-in-flight monitoring systems, such as the Mule Insights Tactical Solution, which augments the tracing of funds moved through the financial system, and initiatives like the European Money Mule Action, which aim to identify and arrest mules and engage with those most vulnerable to becoming a mule, will be vital in preventing and deterring their viability. However, these initiatives will not address the risk posed by rogue insiders who open bank accounts for the benefit of cybercriminals using fake identities. This risk remains and depends on local regulators ensuring standards are maintained across financial institutions and individual financial institutions regularly checking the integrity of employees' work and preventing accounts from being set up that can evade proper KYC processes and due-diligence screening.

#### 4.4 Compliance and Reporting Enhancements

There has been a tendency for cyber-heists to occur in jurisdictions with weaker regulations, and there is a requirement for global standard-setting bodies to do more to remove the platform for potential corruption. It is encouraging that some regulators in East Asia have set up a Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce to enhance the detection, prevention, and disruption of money laundering. Other necessary requirements include tightening customer due diligence measures across financial institutions to include the identification and verification of customers and beneficial owners, as well as clarifying the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. Enhancing reporting channels so that institutions can register their suspicions of illicit activity with a trusted and competent authority might also help to visualize networks of obfuscation and money laundering and identify criminal activity.

#### 4.5 Insufficient Cyber Security

A pervasive issue across financial institutions is a reliance on legacy systems and processes, often spliced together through mergers, leaving them vulnerable to cyber-threat actors. Some cybersecurity experts believe that some banks are not investing smartly in maintaining systems and processes. Instead, they tend to focus on costly, complex perimeter and device endpoint solutions rather than investing in data-centric security around main business assets and detecting abuse and intrusion by looking at the data and application layer. Financial institutions will continue to be vulnerable if they fail to identify and remediate network and application vulnerabilities before criminals have a chance to exploit them. Regular and updated staff awareness courses that help employees understand and spot risks related to spear-phishing are simple initiatives that could pay dividends. For their part, augmented communication by regulators of usable cyber threat information that addresses security incident reports and systemic deficiencies could bolster cybersecurity awareness across the financial sector.

**Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre:**
"For too long, cybercriminals have exploited an international divergence in policy and legislation. I think we’re now starting to see people coming together and understanding how to pool investigations together."

### 5. Conclusion

Large-scale cyber heist attempts are expected to continue and evolve, with attackers focusing on achieving large-scale payouts. Additionally, the desire to disrupt and destabilize the financial system, rather than just stealing funds, should not be overlooked as an ongoing risk. While many financial institutions can recover from financial theft, the distraction and destructive components of some techniques deployed by cyber-actors during a cyber heist can have a far greater operational impact, costing more to correct and leading to prolonged downtime, significantly impacting customers and the institution’s reputation.

Many cyber heists will continue to be detected and stopped, especially as financial institutions improve their controls. However, financial institutions must ensure they do not become complacent. Threat actors will persist in finding ways around controls, including collaborating between groups where combining their skills will provide the desired reward for each threat actor.

Ultimately, some large-scale cyber heist attacks will unfortunately continue to be successful. Therefore, a focus on disrupting criminal activity throughout the money laundering process should continue. Threat groups will continue to collaborate throughout the money laundering lifecycle, leveraging global criminal skillsets and the willingness of many people to be tempted by the lure of an apparent quick and easy payday. Particular focus should apply to money-muling activities and the use of front companies. Collaboration will be key in these areas, both inter-organizational, within jurisdictions, and internationally. Awareness of new money laundering techniques, such as those involving cryptocurrency, will be crucial to staying ahead of the challenge of reducing opportunities for threat groups to benefit from committing high-value cyber heists.
