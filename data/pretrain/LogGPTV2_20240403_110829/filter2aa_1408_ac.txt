proceeds of a cyber-heist by reinvesting in crime, especially in the illegal drugs market. 
Over a third of organised crime groups in Europe, including cyber-criminals, are 
directly involved in the production or trafficking of illegal drugs. Cyber-criminals have 
been known to operate websites, which facilitate the sale of illegal drugs, firearms, 
malicious software, hacking tools, stolen financial information, payment cards and other 
illegal counterfeit goods on a number of dark web marketplaces. In some instances, 
this activity can lead to kickback payments in bitcoin that is equivalent to several                             
million USD$. 
3.4.5 Cryptocurrency and its growing appeal
Identified cases of laundering through cryptocurrencies remain relatively small 
compared to the volumes of cash laundered through traditional methods. However, 
in one major case, a significant cyber-crime group is estimated to have converted 
stolen funds obtained from ATM cashouts into cryptocurrency. The raft of alternative 
cryptocurrencies that offer greater anonymity, as well as services like mixers and 
tumblers that help obscure the source of funds by blending potentially identifiable 
cryptocurrency funds with large amounts of other funds, could boost the appeal of 
cryptocurrency for nefarious purposes.

In one case that resulted in arrest and prosecution, authorities found 15,000 
bitcoins valued at USD$109 million, two sports cars and jewellery worth 
USD$557,000 at the house of the group leader. The group was found to operate 
in a truly international manner: the bitcoin farm where the group mined bitcoin 
in order to launder the stolen funds from the heists was located in an industrial 
building in East Asia, while many of the group arrested originated from Eastern 
Europe and the leader enjoyed the benefits of the stolen funds in Western Europe. 
For heavily sanctioned territories, like a FATF high risk jurisdiction whose modus 
operandi focusses on raising funds with minimal associated risk, cryptocurrency 
offers a different income stream to targeting banks and financial institutions. It 
has been shown how the Lazarus Group have harnessed East Asian facilitators7  
in order to launder funds after a heist at a cryptocurrency exchange, using 
techniques that are similar to that described for heists from banks. The following 
summarises the process from the point of execution of the cyber heist:
• 
Lazarus Group steal funds in cryptocurrency from an exchange and stolen 
cryptocurrency is sent to multiple exchanges as a layering technique.
• 
East Asian facilitators, working on behalf of the Lazarus Group and the 
regime, receive a portion of the stolen funds.
• 
The East Asian facilitators transfer the cryptocurrency across addresses they 
hold, in order to further obfuscate the origin of the funds.
• 
East Asian facilitators move a portion of the received funds through newly 
added bank accounts that are linked to their exchange account – this enables 
the conversion from cryptocurrency into fiat currency. Other stolen funds 
might be transferred in Bitcoin into prepaid gift cards, which can be used at 
other exchanges to purchase additional Bitcoin.
Further insight into the money laundering methods used by the Lazarus Group 
is offered by activity after a cyber-theft at a cryptocurrency exchange in June 
20188. This resulted in the theft of USD$30 million in various crypto-assets. 
Subsequently, almost 2,000 Bitcoin was moved into a cryptocurrency exchange 
in Eastern Europe, over a 4 day period, involving 68 transactions.  It is assessed 
that such a painstaking, strategic pattern of transactions is consistent with a desire 
to circumvent an exchange’s anti money-laundering (AML) controls, including red 
flags associated with transaction limits.

3.4.6 Prepaid cryptocurrency cards 
Cyber-criminals might seek to use cryptocurrency as a method for obfuscating and 
laundering the funds stolen during a cyber-heist, before making various purchases in 
order to integrate the funds. In this instance, cyber-criminals might launder the stolen 
funds at a bitcoin farm, before using financial platforms to load prepaid cards with 
bitcoin. Prepaid cryptocurrency cards can facilitate the reversion of cryptocurrency 
back into fiat currency in small amounts. This technique is enabled by a loophole 
so when the original financial institution issues the card, it does so in conjunction 
with the card issuer’s partner – this partner company receive and convert the funds 
from cryptocurrency into fiat currency. The stolen money from several cyber-heists 
has in some cases been seen to be laundered via cryptocurrencies, using prepaid 
cards that are linked to cryptocurrency wallets. Financial platforms in Europe and 
the UK have been used to load prepaid cards with bitcoin, which were subsequently 
used to purchase jewellery, cars and property with stolen funds – those assets may 
sometimes then be subsequently sold, as a further money laundering step.
3.4.7 Converting cryptocurrency into tangible assets
An emergence of online marketplaces could offer effective methods for converting 
cryptocurrencies into tangible assets that can be held anonymously, or be sold as 
an extra step of laundering the proceeds of a cyber-heist. There are dedicated sites 
that facilitate the purchase of high-end land and property assets across the world, 
including luxury penthouses and tropical islands, as well as watches, jewellery, 
gold bars, and fine art. The concern for the financial system is that these digital 
transactions are conducted in a peer-to-peer manner that circumvents the checks and 
processes by banks, and often require only an e-mail address to make the purchase. 
This means that funds used to make a purchase that have been acquired by criminal 
means can be kept concealed.

4. Mitigation of money laundering risks
4.1 Information sharing technologies
A central initiative in empowering banks to be better able to detect illicit activity refers to them 
having more visibility of a greater pool of data. This is not only with regards to enhancing 
public-private sharing initiatives that foster better timely exchanges between financial 
institutions and law enforcement agencies, but also between financial institutions. In 2017, 
SWIFT created a global information sharing initiative, establishing a dedicated Customer 
Security Intelligence (CSI) team to investigate cyber incidents experienced by its customers and 
introduced a ‘SWIFT ISAC’ information sharing portal to share threat intelligence across the 
SWIFT member community.
Without amendments to legal and regulatory frameworks to enable banks to embrace 
advances in technology and data science to facilitate the safe sharing of AML information, 
identifying illicit behaviour will remain in their blind-spot until it’s too late. The development of 
public-private partnerships to aid in the sharing of information between financial institutions 
and law enforcement has been mainly successful. There are also many technologies for 
enhancing information sharing between banks, including harnessing machine learning to 
enrich and make transaction and account monitoring programs more powerful and efficient. 
One approach that has been investigated by several banks is the use of Privacy Enhancing 
Technology, including homomorphic encryption, as a method of allowing queries to be run 
by one organisation on encrypted or open data sets held by other organisations in a privacy-
enhancing manner to protect the nature of the queries being made.
4.2  Augmented sharing of risk factors pertaining to FATF high risk jurisdiction
A FATF high risk jurisdiction which conducts illicit practises via front companies in East Asia, in 
order to evade sanctions and launder monies, has been the subject of thorough investigations. 
However, there is a need to distil and cascade the key findings from such investigations across 
the international financial system. This will enable institutions to be more agile in identifying 
transactions that might relate to nefarious activity linked to a FATF high risk jurisdiction and trigger 
the need for enhanced due diligence. These refer to the presence of front companies in East Asia 
and the associated red flags that should alert suspicion. And given the activity of some diplomats 
from a FATF high risk jurisdiction to use accounts in the names of family members to evade 
sanctions and assist money laundering practises, these names could be shared with financial 
institutions to screen against as part of KYC and enhanced due diligence processes, as long as it is 
permitted by data protection and legal frameworks in various jurisdictions. 
Similarly, augmented sharing of the red flags / situational circumstances that led to the 
successful arrest of individuals involved in the laundering stages of a cyber-heist could greatly 
increase awareness and agility in financial institutions and law enforcement agencies across 
various jurisdictions, which could ultimately lead to a reduction in vulnerabilities. Standard setting 
organisations, as well as regional Fraud Intelligence Units, could be effective conduits for such risk 
mitigating information sharing.

4.3  Money-Mule initiatives 
The essential role of the money-mule in facilitating successful cyber-heists 
and enabling criminals to separate themselves from the fraud and the 
money laundering stages makes it an obvious focus area for risk mitigating 
initiatives. Numerous government, policing and industry initiatives have 
been launched, including:
• 
A series of coordinated actions by Europol’s Cybercrime Centre (EC3), 
the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), Eurojust, and the 
European Banking Federation have supported the European Money-
mule Action initiative.
• 
Cifas, the UK’s fraud prevention service have launched a joint 
campaign with Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK), which fights 
financial fraud for the UK payments industry, called the Don’t Be 
Fooled campaign. This aims to deter young people – in particular 
students – from becoming money-mules.
• 
In December 2019, the U.S. DOJ and federal, state and international 
law enforcement partners announced a concentrated effort across 
the country and around the world to halt money-mule activity and 
shut down the enterprises that exploit the most vulnerable in society. 
The initiative aims to end the conduct of money-mules, as well as 
execute search warrants to secure evidence from money-mules who 
knowingly aided and abetted fraud schemes.
The success of funds-in-flight monitoring systems such as the Mule 
Insights Tactical Solution9, that looks to augment the tracing of funds 
that are moved through the financial system, as well as initiatives like the 
European Money Mule Action that aims to identify and arrest mules, as 
well as engage with those most vulnerable to becoming a mule will be 
vital in preventing and deterring their viability. However, these initiatives 
will not address the risk posed by the rogue insider, who opens a bank 
account for the benefit of a cyber-criminal using a fake identity. This risk 
remains and is dependent on local regulators ensuring standards are 
maintained across financial institutions, as well as individual financial 
institutions regularly checking the integrity of employees’ work and 
preventing accounts being set-up that are able to evade proper KYC 
processes and due-diligence screening.

4.4 
 Compliance and reporting enhancements 
There has been a tendency for cyber-heists to occur in jurisdictions where regulations are 
weaker, and there is a requirement for global standard setting bodies to do more in removing 
the platform for potential corruption. It is encouraging that some regulators in East Asia 
have set up a Fraud and Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce in order to enhance the 
detection, prevention and disruption of money laundering. Other necessary requirements 
include tightening customer due diligence measures across financial institutions, to include 
the identification and verification of customers and the beneficial owner, as well as clarifying 
the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. Enhancing reporting channels 
so that institutions can register their suspicions of illicit activity to a trusted and competent 
authority might also help to visualise networks of obfuscation and money laundering and 
identify criminal activity.
4.5  Insufficient cyber security
A pervasive issue across financial institutions is a reliance on legacy systems 
and processes. Often they have been spliced together through mergers, 
leaving them vulnerable to cyber-threat actors. Some cyber-security experts 
believe some banks are not investing smartly in maintaining systems and 
processes. Instead, they tend to focus on costly, complex, perimeter and 
device endpoint solutions, rather than focusing on investing in data centric 
security around main business assets and detecting abuse and intrusion 
by looking at the data and application layer. Financial institutions will 
continue to be vulnerable if they fail to identify and remediate network and 
application vulnerabilities before criminals have a chance to exploit them. 
Similarly, regular and updated staff awareness courses that help employees 
understand and spot risks relating to spear-phishing are simple initiatives that 
could pay dividends. For their part, augmented communication by regulators 
of usable cyber threat information that addresses security incident reports 
and systemic deficiencies could bolster cyber-security awareness across the 
financial sector.
“For too long, cybercriminals have exploited an international divergence 
in policy and legislation. I think we’re now starting to see people coming 
together and understanding how to pool investigations together.”

5. Conclusion
Large-scale cyber heist attempts are expected to continue and to evolve – the attackers are focused on going 
after large-scale payouts and will continue to mount attacks to achieve their aims. In addition, the desire to 
disrupt and destabilise the financial system, as opposed to just stealing funds should not be overlooked as an 
ongoing risk. Whereas many financial institutions are likely to be able to recover from just a financial theft, the 
distraction and destructive components of some techniques deployed by cyber-actors during a cyber heist are 
likely to have far greater operational impact. This can cost more to correct, as well as lead to a prolonged period 
of downtime for the financial institution, significantly impacting their customers and the institution’s reputation.
Many cyber heists will continue to be detected and stopped, especially as financial institutions continue to 
improve their controls. However, financial institutions also need to ensure they don’t become complacent. Threat 
actors have shown they will persist to seek to find ways around controls, including collaborating between groups 
where combining their skills will provide the desired reward for each threat actor.
Ultimately, some large-scale cyber heist attacks will unfortunately continue to be successful. Therefore, as 
money laundering is essential to a threat group realising the benefits of a successful large-scale cyber heist, a 
focus on seeking to disrupt criminal activity throughout the money laundering process should continue.
Threat groups will continue to collaborate throughout the money laundering lifecycle, leveraging the global 
criminal skillsets available and the willingness of many people to be tempted by the lure of an apparent quick 
and easy payday. Particular focus therefore should apply to the money-muling activities and also to the 
use of front companies. Collaboration will be key in these areas, both inter-organisational, within jurisdictions 
and internationally. In addition, awareness of new money laundering techniques, such as those involving 
cryptocurrency, will be key to staying ahead of the challenge of reducing the opportunities for threat groups to 
benefit from committing high-value cyber heists.
