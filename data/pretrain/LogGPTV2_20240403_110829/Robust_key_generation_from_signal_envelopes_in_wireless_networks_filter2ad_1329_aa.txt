ABSTRACT
The broadcast nature of a wireless link provides a natural
eavesdropping and intervention capability to an adversary.
Thus, securing a wireless link is essential to the security of
a wireless network, and key generation algorithms are nec-
essary for securing wireless links. However, traditional key
agreement algorithms can be very costly in many settings,
e.g. in wireless ad-hoc networks, since they consume scarce
resources such as bandwidth and battery power.
Traditional key agreement algorithms are not suitable for
wireless ad-hoc networks since they consume scarce resources
such as bandwidth and battery power.
This paper presents a novel approach that couples the
physical layer characteristics of wireless networks with key
generation algorithms. It is based on the wireless commu-
nication phenomenon known as the principle of reciprocity
which states that in the absence of interference both trans-
mitter and receiver experience the same signal envelope.
The key-observation here is that the signal envelope infor-
mation can provide to the two transceivers two correlated
random sources that provide suﬃcient amounts of entropy
which can be used to extract a cryptographic key. In con-
trast, it is virtually impossible for a third party, which is
not located at one of the transceiver’s position, to obtain or

predict the exact envelope; thus retrieve the key. Since in
the presence of interference strict reciprocity property can
not be maintained; our methodology is based on detecting
deep fades to extract correlated bitstrings. In particular, we
show how a pair of transceivers can reconcile such bitstrings
and ﬁnally ﬂatten their distribution to reach key agreement.
In our constructions we use cryptographic tools related to
randomness extraction and information reconciliation. We
introduce “secure fuzzy information reconciliators” a tool
that enables us to describe robust key generation systems in
our setting. Finally we provide a computational study that
presents a simulation of a wireless channel that demonstrates
the feasibility of our approach and justiﬁes the assumptions
made in our analysis.

INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Secure communications in wireless ad-hoc networks re-
quires eﬃcient key generation and update (renewal) algo-
rithms which are essential to ensure (1) message conﬁden-
tiality, (2) message integrity, and (3) node authentication.
However, several characteristics of wireless ad-hoc networks
make commonly used solutions for eﬃcient key generation
and update algorithms in wired networks inapplicable. Firstly,
the wireless communication medium is in general a broad-
cast environment — anyone with a tuned receiver within a
radius that permits adequate signal to interference and noise
ratio (SINR) can eavesdrop. Secondly, network nodes often
operate with limited battery and computation power, and
401memory. Thirdly, wireless nodes may be mobile and the
state information about their neighborhood may change —
possibly often. Fourthly, nodes may not be able to access
to public key infrastructure (PKI) for securing their com-
munications.
It is desirable to design key generation and
renewal algorithms for wireless ad-hoc networks that will
minimize message exchange. Currently, there are no algo-
rithms to achieve key generation and renewal without ex-
changing messages and investing great computational cost.
Existing key-generation algorithms such as Diﬃe-Hellman
[18] are costly in terms of computation and communication
and are designed independently from the physical character-
istics of the networks where they will be executed.
The main contribution of this work is to couple the phys-
ical channel characteristics with key generation algorithms
to secure wireless ad-hoc networks. The novelty lies in the
robustness of this technique to ambient interference and to
errors in the channel estimation. Our techniques exploit
the reciprocity principle of wireless communications, which
states that two transmitters working with the same carrier
frequency, in the absence of interference (we relax this later)
will experience the same (relative) signal strength from each
other at the same time1.
In practice, the presence of interference cannot be ne-
glected in a wireless network and the reciprocity principle
does not strictly apply. Yet the techniques presented here
do not require identical signal envelopes for both parties, but
only matching deep fades, which are impervious to reason-
able levels of interference, i.e. SINR. By reasonable levels
of SINR, we mean SINR levels that allow the communica-
tion link to have acceptable bit error rate (BER). We note
that the acceptable SINR depends on the speciﬁc modu-
lation technique. For example, if the target symbol error
rate (SER) is 10−5 then for PSK modulation we require
the SINR to be about 24 dB for a typical Rayleigh channel
(i.e., the received signal power is 24 dB stronger than the
combined receiver noise and perceived ambient interference).
This means that the deep fades that can be measured go as
far as -24 dB deep (that is, when the receiver predominantly
perceives noise plus interference, the desired signal having
dropped below those two). The modulation technique QAM
64 (that provides higher rates at the expense of greater sen-
sitivity to noise,) will require an SINR of about 33 dB for
the same SER. Therefore, detecting a deep fade even in the
presence of noise and interference is possible.
In a typical environment, reﬂective surfaces vary from mo-
ment to moment (i.e., received signals are time-variant): a
truck may be passing by a window, a reﬂective surface may
tilt removing or adding multi-path, or the network node it-
self may be in a moving vehicle. Hence the fading charac-
teristics are, in practice, very diﬃcult to predict, and are
usually modeled as a stochastic process. However, whatever
realization of that process occurs for a network receiver, the
signal it sends back to its counterpart will experience the
same realization of that fading at that instant. Note also
1This is because the typical fading phenomenon is created by
the transmitted signal bouncing oﬀ of various reﬂectors on
its way to the receiver and all these multi-path signals arrive
with phase oﬀsets. When the phase diﬀerence produces de-
structive interference, the receiver experiences a deep fade.
When the phase diﬀerence is small, the receiver experiences
a strong signal. But the electromagnetic paths going from
the transmitter to the receiver are the same as if their roles
were reversed.

2 vs. time. Vertical axis: proportional to voltage on

Signal from radio 1 vs. signal from radio 2. The small
deviations from a line through (0,0) with unit slope
are caused by: 1) operator moving during data acquisi-
tion, and 2) Small diﬀerences between the radios. The
signals are highly correlated, with a correlation coeﬃ-
cient of 0.94. (c): same as center (b), but with one of
the radios moved to another room 20 feet away. We
compare the second data set with one of previous sets.
The multipath has changed dramatically, and only ran-
dom correlations are left (C=0.1) Thus eavesdropping
will be virtually impossible for an adversary unless it
comes very close to the sender or receiver, but then it
will be detectable.
that the phase diﬀerences of the arriving multi-paths are
quite sensitive to the position. For example, for a carrier of
850 M Hz, the wavelength is about a foot long, thus con-
structive interference (signal high) may change to destruc-
tive interference (deep fade) by shifting a mere half a foot.
Thus, a transceiver acting as an eavesdropper, in any other
position will experience diﬀerent fading characteristics.
Figure 1 demonstrates the reciprocity measurement using
two Ultra Wide Band (UWB) transceivers. As depicted in
Figure 1, two transmitters experience the same (relative)
signal strength, and the received signals at the receivers are
highly correlated. Also it is clear from the ﬁgure that the
eavesdropper’s received signal has very little correlation with
the received signal in the legitimate receivers. By passing
the UWB signal through a ﬁlter with the bandwidth of the
channel we get two signals (at both legitimate receivers).
These two signals will have a deep fade at the same time
instance.
The same phenomenon happens when the measurements
are done in frequency domain (the frequency domain mea-
surement is the dual of time domain measurement)as shown
in Figure 2. The measurements are done at both legitimate
receivers. As can be seen from the measured frequency re-
sponse, the deep fades occur at the same frequency. The
reason that some of the deep fades do not match in this ﬁg-
ure is because the measurements are not done at exactly the
same time (transceivers cannot transmit and receive simul-
taneously, but must allow for a small delay). So the change
in environment appears in the measurement.
Our hypothesis is that these fading graphs can be used to
generate cryptographic keys, and the non-stationary charac-
teristics of a wireless network can be used to extract enough
a pseudo random function to generate a symmetric session
key. In key-chain based solutions, each wireless node is pre-
distributed a list of keys, called a key-chain. Two nodes
just exchange their list of key IDs and use the combination
of common keys as the symmetric session key. Key-chains
must be carefully designed so that either two nodes have a
key in common in their key-chains and they have a wireless
link between them, or there is a path, called a key-path,
among these two nodes where each pair of neighboring nodes
on this path have a key in common.
Key pre-distribution approaches are outside the scope of
this work, since they are not pertinent to our setting (that
assumes no joint node setup). Algorithms to generate the
key-chains fall into one of the three classes: (i) probabilis-
tic [20] [12] where key-chains are randomly selected among a
pool of keys, (ii) deterministic where key chains are designed
from a set of keys by using algorithms such as Balanced In-
complete Block Design (BIBD) of design theory [8, 10, 9],
and (iii) hybrid probabilistic and deterministic schemes [8].
In dynamic key generation solutions a set of public and pri-
vate keying materials is formed in a probabilistic, determin-
istic or hybrid manner and is pre-distributed to each wireless
node. Two nodes exchange their public information such as
node ID in a polynomial based solution [4] or public column
vector in matrix based solution [3].
The concept of combining key management and physi-
cal layer characteristics is ﬁrst presented in [21]. More re-
cently (independently from our research) in [2] which uses
steerable parasitic array radiator antennae in contrast with
our method that requires only ubiquitous and cheap omni-
directional antennae. Furthermore, their method relies on
strict reciprocity, with no more distortion than noise and
diﬀerences in transmission powers. In a real network, the
most pernicious presence causing distortion is interference,
not noise, which is often orders of magnitude lower than
interference. This breaks down reciprocity, which is why
our method addresses this problem by focusing on the deep
fades, rather than the entire envelope. In [31] communica-
tion between an Access Point and a User Terminal is con-
sidered. This approach requires also steerable parasitic ar-
ray radiator antennae. In addition to the special antenna,
that technique requires overhead bandwidth expenditure in
that the Access Point must transmit a constant amplitude
wave, which serves no purpose other than generating the
key. Once again, strict reciprocity is required for the uplink
and downlink signal proﬁles to match.
In a practical set-
ting with interference present, that simply won’t be avail-
able. Another method which is based on the time-varying
frequency characteristics, and is suitable for OFDM systems
is proposed in [28]. It utilizes channel reciprocity and the
time-variant frequency characteristics to generate a security
key. It also measures time diﬀerence compensation of the
channel and uses a synchronous addition process for noise
reduction to prevent errors in key generation, which is diﬀer-
ent from ours. In comparison, our approach is much more
inexpensive and less sensitive to estimation errors. Over-
all, compared to all these previous works, our approach is
an improvement, as it eliminates message exchanges, spe-
cial antennas, strict reciprocity assumptions and does not
limit itself to UWB communication.
Our approach takes advantage of cryptographic tools that
relate to randomness extractors, [32, 34] and fuzzy extrac-
tors [14]. Key agreement in our work targets the setting

entropy to obtain cryptographically secure keys. As long as
the channel does not become permanently stationary, the
keys can be renewed frequently to cope with playback at-
tacks. Furthermore, once the ﬁrst key is securely obtained,
such properties can be used to ensure authenticity, and pre-
vent man-in-the-middle and replay attacks.
To facilitate robust cryptographic key-generations two tech-
