Question: "Your organization is setting up additional logging for certificate pinning rules by configuring the 'PinRulesLogDir' registry setting. A colleague suggests that only administrators require full access to the pin rule log folder. What is the most appropriate counterargument to this claim based on the described setup process?"
 "A": "Full access permissions are unnecessary because the log folder is only used for read operations by Windows."
 "B": "All users and applications must have full access to the folder to ensure proper logging of pin rules."
 "C": "Only applications require full access, while users should be provided with read-only permissions to the log folder."
 "D": "The 'PinRulesLogDir' should be set to a read-only folder to prevent unauthorized modifications to the logs."
Answer: B
