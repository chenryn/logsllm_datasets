A  Note About the Panel
We did not get any volunteers from the Middle East, 
Asia, Africa or South America.  
We tried for as much other diversity as possible.

about us
Beth
Freeside
Atlanta, Ga.
• Freeside is a non-proﬁt hackerspace in 
Atlanta, not to be confused with Freeside.it 
• Started by a couple friends from 
Columbus, Ga. & dc404, including folks from 
various other local groups & via 
hackerspaces.org:
•
 404.se2600
•
ALE (Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts)
•
Atlanta Perl Mongers & AtlantaArduino
•
Dorkbot ATL & Botlanta & NAISG
• We started 6 months ago, 3 friends, at a 
bar, meeting once a week. Now we have an 
insane venue, 50 members and are already 
working on space-related projects.
• So far, we stole the CV&B’s from 
MindSpring, (Thanks Charles!) have a 
Hackerspace Manifesto (Thanks Eater!), and 
a couple safety rules like: “be safe”
• Visit our site to see how and what we are 
doing.

The Black Lodge 
“... But it is said, if 
you confront the 
Black Lodge with 
imperfect courage, 
it will utterly 
annihilate your 
soul.“
-Dep. Hawk, Twin 
Peaks
About us..
• Founded October 2008 in Kirkland, WA
• 8 primary members: noid, Luna, Vidiot, 
Cyben, Londo, Dark Tangent, Don Ankney, 
“Dr.” Brian Walls
• www.black-lodge.org
• Interests: hardware hacking, metal working, 
coding, photography, socializing, art, hacking, 
beer brewing, meteorology, HAM radio
Why’d we do it?
• We wanted a shared, collaborative space
• Hardly any of us have garages
• We all have more tools than we know 
what to do with
• We wanted a nice place for social events
• We wanted to do our part to help the 
community
How we operate
• 7 of us pay the bills out of pocket
• 24 hour access to the Lodge to those that 
pay rent
• When the Lodge is open, it is open to all
• Can be opened by request
• Monthly board meetings
HacDC
• HacDC is a Non-Proﬁt
• The founders knew each other from DefCon, the 
rest of the founding
• members found each other primarily through 
DorkbotDC and MakeDC
• It took us about three months from our ﬁrst 
meetings to leasing a space.
• We are funded primarily by member dues, 
additionally by donations
• Our guiding rule: Don't act in a way that requires 
us to make a new rule (i.e. be excellent to each 
other.)

Leveraging Community Organizations to Build
Neighborhood Wireless Networks
If you remember nothing 
else...
 Build wireless networks where you live
 Sustainability should be built into the process
 Partner with nearby organizations
 Engage your users through training & 
collaborative learning
 Applied knowledge = $$$ = paying the bills
 Put the wheels on before you reinvent them
Phase I: Building a stable 
 Physical Base: Rebuild the Layer 1 IT infrastructure 
through comprehensive re-wiring
 Funding Base: Funding through lowering costs
Replace multiple low-bandwith links with fat pipe
Replace multiple POTS lines with VOIP
Replace need for a security guard
 People Base: Making friends through providing 
services, training, tech support, savings.
Phase II: Community through technology
 Now that the church is online, we're building a 
community network around community wireless
 Single external wireless network for the community 
around the church
 Provide training and support through community 
events targeted towards users within the network 
range
 Provide computers, routers and other physical 
resources for extension & experimentation
Phase III: Extend the 
Network
 “If you build it, they will come.”
 Encourage independent experimentation and 
experimentation for extending the main 
network
 Find new points of presence for extending the 
main network
 Encourage mesh networking attaching to the 
main network

To Sum it Up:
• You can join or build a hackerspace in your 
town.
• You can support hackerspaces at home and 
abroad.
• Hackerspaces are as different as the people 
that create them. 
• Building and maintaining a hackerspace is a 
project in and of itself.
