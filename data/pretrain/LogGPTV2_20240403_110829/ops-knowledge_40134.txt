User: What are the differences between a systems programming language and Application programming language?
Assistant: These are not exact concepts, but in essence, systems programming languages are suitable for writing operating systems (so they have low-level concepts such as pointers, integration with assembler, data types corresponding to memory and register organization), while the application programming languages are more suitable for writing applications, so they generally use higher-level concepts to represent the computation (such as OOP, closures, in-built complex datatypes and so on).
