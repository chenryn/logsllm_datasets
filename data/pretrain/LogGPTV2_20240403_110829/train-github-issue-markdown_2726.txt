I decided to start using transitions with material-ui 0.18.7, installed react-
transition-group v2 ( _RTGV2_ ), was happy with my transitions, then started
noticing really weird behavior in unrelated components. In particular, ripples
fail by leaving a big circle over the rippling component. In my case, I'd just
added an unrelated FloatingActionButton when I discovered this, and thought it
had run amok.
NPM didn't gripe about material-ui having a conflict. I don't see what you
could do differently that would make it complain.
Moving to RTGV2 is a big move, so if you do get more push for compatibility in
material-ui <1.0, you'll probably need to somehow allow clients to use either
v1 or v2 - which is probably prohibitively difficult.
A runtime check and console spew for the wrong version might make sense,
though.
