## Abstract
Accurate and complete modeling of the Internet topology at the Autonomous System (AS) level is crucial for future protocol design, performance evaluation, simulation, and analysis. However, constructing an accurate representation remains a challenge. In this paper, we collect BGP route announcements from Looking Glass (LG) servers to build an AS-level topology. By querying 245 LG servers across 110 countries, we construct an AS topology with approximately 116,000 AS links, discovering 11,000 new AS links and 686 new ASes. We conclude that collecting BGP traces from LG servers can significantly enhance the current view of the AS topology provided by BGP collector projects such as RouteViews.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet is composed of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exchange inter-domain routing information using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The entire Internet can be visualized as an AS-level topology graph where each AS is a node, and a BGP connection between two ASes is a link. The importance of the AS topology has been highlighted in various studies, including analyzing topological properties, inferring AS relationships, building network topology generators for simulations, and evaluating the effectiveness of new protocols and improvements. Despite significant efforts, developing a complete and accurate view of the AS-level topology remains a challenge.

There are three main approaches to constructing the AS topology, each with its own limitations:
- **Passive measurements** by collecting BGP routing tables and updates suffer from routing policy filters and best path selection decisions made by neighboring ASes.
- **Active measurements** using traceroute are error-prone and can generate false AS links due to non-responsive hosts or IP-to-AS mapping errors.
- **Internet Routing Registry (IRR)** data is often incomplete, outdated, and biased towards certain regions.

In this paper, we focus on constructing the AS topology using Looking Glass (LG) servers, which are web-based portals run by ISPs or NOCs to provide network status information. We collected around 116,000 AS links from 245 LG servers across 110 countries. Our analysis shows that LG servers can help discover new AS links and ASes not observed in other AS topologies.

## 2. Looking Glass Servers
Looking Glass (LG) servers are web-based portals operated by network operators to provide a view into the BGP routing tables of the ASes in which the server resides. These servers allow running commands like `traceroute` and `show ip bgp summary` from BGP routers under their control. For example, the LG server of Hurricane Electric provides facilities to run LG commands on BGP routers distributed across 92 locations worldwide.

We conducted a comprehensive investigation to identify operational LG servers and their functionalities. We built a list of LG servers from sources such as peeringDB, Traceroute.org, and BGP4.as. After removing duplicates, we found 1,200 LG servers, of which only 420 were operational in March 2013. Our scripts could query 388 LG servers, as some websites were not parsable and others limited automated queries.

We queried 388 LG servers (running on 410 ASes) to learn their supported functionalities. Commonly supported commands include `traceroute`, `ping`, and `show ip bgp summary`. Table 1 and Table 2 illustrate sample results from these commands.

### Table 1: Sample Result of the `show ip bgp summary` Command
| Router | Local AS Number | Neighbor | AS# | State | Time | Received | Sent |
|--------|-----------------|----------|-----|-------|------|----------|------|
| cr1-eqx3-pa3 | 29075 | 195.42.144.104 | 6939 | ESTAB | 61d | 36,464 | 153 |

### Table 2: Sample Result of the `BGP neighbor ip advertised routes` Command
| Prefix | Next Hop | AS PATH |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 149.154.80.0/21 | 195.42.144.71 | 29075 50618 57141 |
| 91.227.48.0/24 | 195.42.144.71 | 29075 50618 25091 56728 |

## 3. AS-Level Topologies
We describe our methodology for building an AS topology from LG servers and briefly discuss other AS topologies derived from BGP traces, traceroute, and IRR.

### 3.1 AS Topology Derived from LG Servers
We designed a tool to automate the querying process to 388 LG servers. The tool issues 30 queries in parallel and waits 15 seconds between successive queries to avoid overloading the servers. The process involves several steps:
1. Identify supported commands and LG routers.
2. Send `show ip bgp summary` to each LG router.
3. Extract IP addresses of neighboring routers.
4. Send `BGP neighbor ip advertised routes` to collect BGP routes.
5. Store responses for AS topology construction.

We queried 245 LG servers that support `show ip bgp summary` from 1,900 locations across 110 countries, twice a week in March 2013. We combined 8 snapshots to create an AS link dataset with around 70,000 AS links, of which 77% were intra-AS links. We filtered out these intra-AS links, leaving 16,000 inter-AS links.

We also queried 59 LG servers that support `BGP neighbor ip advertised routes` once a week in March 2013. These servers are located in 250 locations across 40 countries and advertise routes to 5,000 routers of neighboring ASes. From the BGP traces, we extracted around 2 million AS paths, resulting in 103,000 AS links.

Overall, we collected 116,000 unique AS links (103,000 + 16,000 - 3,000 overlapping AS links). This is the first study to investigate both `show ip bgp summary` and `BGP neighbor ip advertised routes` commands for AS topology construction.

### 3.2 Other AS-Level Topologies
We describe other AS topologies used in this paper:
- **BGP-based (IRL)**: UCLA IRL regularly publishes AS topologies from BGP traces shared by RouteViews, RIPE-RIS, PCH, and Internet2. We found 179,000 AS links in the IRL topology in March 2013.
- **Traceroute-based (Ark)**: CAIDA Ark provides AS topologies derived from traceroute measurements. We used direct AS links from the Ark dataset, finding 116,000 AS links in March 2013.
- **iPlane**: iPlane performs daily traceroutes from around 300 PlanetLab locations. We found 81,000 AS links in the iPlane topology in March 2013.
- **Internet Routing Registry (IRR)**: The IRR contains globally distributed databases with AS routing and address information. We extracted 206,000 AS links from the IRR, with 75% of them not observed in BGP and traceroute-based topologies.

## Conclusion
Collecting BGP traces from Looking Glass servers can significantly enhance the current view of the AS topology. Our study discovered 11,000 new AS links and 686 new ASes, providing a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the Internet's AS-level topology.
