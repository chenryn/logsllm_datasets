informational sponsorship.” [23]) As we discuss below, the ads
in our dataset often convey signiﬁcant (sometimes erroneous)
technical details and threat information, which may contribute
to viewers’ mental models of VPNs.
B. Ads on YouTube
Advertisements on YouTube can be divided into two broad
categories: ads served by YouTube and inﬂuencer ads. For the
former, YouTube places ads on distinct UI elements on the
page—typically in the video player by interrupting videos—
with the YouTubers having limited control over ad content.
In contrast, with inﬂuencer ads, YouTubers generally embed
the advertisement into the video, making it part of the content
itself. In this work, we exclusively focus on inﬂuencer ads.
The unique—in some cases deeply personal—relationship
between YouTubers and their audiences makes YouTube a
particularly well suited platform for inﬂuencer advertise-
ments [24]. In contrast to ads served by YouTube, inﬂuencer
ads produced by YouTubers can better target communication
to the speciﬁc audience [25]. Because they are served from
the same source, they are less susceptible to ad blockers [26].
YouTubers generate revenue through inﬂuencer ads via two
primary mechanisms: (1) direct payment for promotion of the
product [27], and/or (2) commissions from sales associated
with the ads, via coupon codes and/or afﬁliate links [28].
Research suggests inﬂuencer ads are more cost-effective and
result in more engagement than traditional brand-promoted
ads [25]. A systematic analysis of factors that contribute to
the success of inﬂuencer ads found social advocacy (having a
positive attitude toward the YouTubers), trustworthiness, and
to a lesser extent likability and homophily, to be signiﬁcant
factors in the perceived credibility of information [29].
Although academic work on the prominence of afﬁliate
marketing is limited, Mathur et al. showed that afﬁliate-link
marketing was widespread on YouTube, in most cases without
appropriate disclosure, which may violate U.S.
law [12].
Using the same dataset, Swart et al. later proposed a browser
extension to automatically detect and disclose such links [30].
We also detect numerous ads that might violate U.S. law,
suggesting the problem isn’t limited to afﬁliate links.
Although our study focuses on VPN ads, our results provide
further context about disclosure of inﬂuencer ads. Our dataset
can be used for further analysis of inﬂuencer ads on YouTube.

C. Users, PETs, and VPNs
The reasons people use, can’t use, won’t use, or misuse
various PETs have been a common topic of research (e.g., [31–
35]). Among other reasons, misuses of PETs are often linked
to inadequate mental models [31, 34–38]. In many cases,
when users cannot be expected to develop complete, functional
mental models of complex technologies, various interventions
are employed to promote correct use (e.g., [1, 5]).
User mental models of VPNs are relatively under-researched
compared to other PETs (e.g., encrypted messaging apps).
Recently, investigating a likely tech-savvy population, Namara
et al. found that a majority of VPN users use them for non-
privacy use cases (e.g., accessing geo-locked content) [38].
However, the same study found that users who do use VPNs
for privacy tend to keep using them longer. Other researchers
have noted people using VPNs for increased security and
privacy on public networks, as well as to prevent hacks and
password leaks [39]. We observe YouTubers conveying similar
ideas about VPN features and beneﬁts.
Further, research on popular privacy-focused VPNs has
identiﬁed many ﬂaws [9–11, 40–43]. Thus, researchers have
in some cases refrained from recommending them as a privacy
tool [44]. Notably, though some researchers recommend them
for use [39], “free” VPNs have often been found to promise
security while actively violating users’ privacy [9]. Recent
reporting also shows that mainstream paid VPNs (some of
which also appear in our dataset) may engage in privacy-
violating data collection practices [42].
D. Driving adoption of security and privacy tools
Some industries have been successful at driving adoption of
PETs without relying on persuasion. According to Duo, recent
wide-scale adoption of two-factor authentication is largely
driven by companies forcing their customers to adopt the tech-
nology [45]. The 1990s antivirus software boom was driven by
distribution through computer and OS manufacturers [46–48].
Companies often use security as a selling point, to varying
degrees of success. In the late 2000’s, Apple’s successful “Get
a Mac” push partially campaigned campaigned on Macs being
less prone to malware than PCs [49]. These ads presented
security as a fact without going further into details; recent
industry reports show that Macs are more targeted by mal-
ware developers than their PC counterparts [50]. Recently,
Whatsapp attempted and failed to convey the guarantees of
end-to-end encryption to their user base of billions [51, 52].
Public backlash to Whatsapp’s privacy policy moved them to
redouble those efforts, but this move was motivated by user
retention more than new user adoption [53].
A different advertising paradigm is emerging with VPN
companies. Rather than direct communication from the com-
pany, inﬂuencers who have the ﬂexibility to market to their
own audiences are designing promotions. In this paper, we
investigate how these intermediaries persuade their viewers to
adopt VPNs, and how prevalent these ads are on YouTube. We
ﬁnd that VPN ads likely reach billions of viewers, comparable
to ambitious industry efforts at inﬂuencing users’ understand-
ings of security and privacy tools.
III. THE DATASET
Here we describe how we sample YouTube and determine
which videos contain VPN ads, as well as the details of our
qualitative analysis of ad content. Details of each sample we
consider are given below and summarized in Table I.
A. Large-scale scrape
To obtain the dataset, we initially use random preﬁx sam-
pling [58], which in theory allows us to sample 1/64th (1.6%)
of all videos on YouTube.3 In this step, we do not download
the videos themselves, only relevant metadata (see Table I).
In practice, some preﬁxes (e.g., those starting with “ ”)
are incompatible. As such, our implementation attempted to
sample 1.5% of all videos, capturing the brief details of
86.3M videos (the representative sample). We then collected
additional details for videos with more than 800 views, which
covers more than 99% of total views in the representative
sample. We call these 10.7M highly viewed videos the 10M
dataset. Within the 10M dataset, we downloaded English
subtitles when available (1.6M videos). We also obtained
additional details from the YouTube data API for a random
subset of the 10M dataset (195.0K videos). We use YouTube
API data when reporting video metadata. Data was collected
between August 2020 and March 2021.
To obtain the representative sample and 10M dataset, we
used up to 16 parallel scrapers, among which we divided
all compatible ﬁve-character YouTube ID preﬁxes. When
scraping for subtitles and additional details, we used a slightly
modiﬁed version of youtube-dl4, an open-source online video
downloader program. Some of the scrapers operated through
proxies and switched server locations once every ∼10 hours.
Conﬁrming the dataset
We partially revalidate random
preﬁx sampling on YouTube, as initially documented by Zhou
et al. [58]. We compare the videos we obtained to a 2016
modiﬁed random sample released by YouTube [59], ﬁnding
that our representative sample contained the details of 51.7K of
the 54.0K videos that existed in the preﬁx space our implemen-
tation attempted to scrape. This suggests we likely obtained
95.8% of all YouTube videos falling within the searched preﬁx
space (Agresti-Coull [60] CI95%=(0.956, 0.959)).5 Overall, we
likely sampled 1.4% of all YouTube videos.
B. Finding videos with VPN ads
To identify videos containing VPN ads, we ﬁrst identify all
videos in the 10M dataset whose English subtitles include the
abbreviation “VPN” (1,751 out of 1.6M videos) to establish a
3Videos on YouTube are assigned an 11-digit id, where the ﬁrst 10 are
random base64 digits [58]. Using YouTube’s search feature, we are able to
obtain all videos with the ﬁxed ﬁfth digit “-” (see referenced videos throughout
the paper for examples), limiting the dataset to 1/64th of YouTube.

5Although this dataset cannot be used to validate videos that were uploaded
after 2016, we ﬁnd it reasonable to assume the remaining data is equally valid.

candidate dataset. Next, three researchers applied an open-
coding approach on ∼25% (425 videos) of this candidate
dataset to precisely deﬁne what VPN ads are for this study.
Our ﬁnal deﬁnition includes all videos that mention VPNs
and are afﬁliated, via explicit disclosure or an undisclosed
afﬁliate link, with VPN companies. Three researchers indepen-
dently applied this deﬁnition to code an additional 175 videos
(∼ 10% of the candidate dataset), reaching Krippendorff’s
α of 0.852 and thereby validating it [61]. Finally, the three
researchers split the remaining candidate videos, each of which
was adjudicated by one researcher. This resulted in 359 videos
with VPN ads (4.1E-4% of the representative sample).
C. Further ﬁltering for analysis
Before conducting our in-depth analysis, we ﬁltered out
an additional 116 videos (12.4M total views) that were not
suitable for analysis, due to one or more of the following:
• The video was entirely about VPNs (e.g., [62]). These are
generally long and unstructured, and the ad is difﬁcult to
distinguish from the other content. (63 videos, 4.7M views)
• The video was removed from YouTube between collection
and analysis, before we were able to download it. Some
were taken down by YouTube, as part of a crackdown on
right-wing and/or conspiratorial videos (e.g., [63], which
had been sponsored by Norton [64]). Others were removed
by their creators. (18 videos, 201.2K views)
• The video contained ads for other security products that
bundle in VPNs as a side product. In these videos, it is
difﬁcult to distinguish features speciﬁc to the VPN from
the other product(s). (17 videos, 6.8M views)
• The video was afﬁliated with a VPN company but did
not have substantial advertisements (e.g., [65]). (9 videos,
501.9K views)
• The video was mistakenly classiﬁed as an ad initially,
removed after further inspection. (9 videos, 41,9K views)
• The video was sponsored by a VPN company but promotes
a non-VPN product (e.g., NordVPN’s password manager
“NordPass” [66]). (2 videos, 292.0K views)
We manually analyze the remaining 243 videos (62.7M
total views), which we call the VPN ad sample, in depth. We
analyze each video in two ways: (1) We code the speciﬁc
threat models conveyed in the ad (threat-model statements),
and (2) we code additional information not related to threat
models (supplemental codes).
To capture threat models, we applied content analysis [67]
and developed a novel codebook structure to capture relations
between entities. We divide each ad into units of analysis—
typically one distinct claim—and assign up to four sub-
codes: 1) who the adversary is, 2) what the adversary does,

3) the asset being attacked or defended, and 4) what the
VPN does. This allows us to capture the relationship among
adversaries, threats, and protective measures as described by
the ad. For example, one ad claims the VPN “Protects you
from . . . people trying to steal your private information.” [57]
In this case, the adversary is the poorly speciﬁed “people,”
