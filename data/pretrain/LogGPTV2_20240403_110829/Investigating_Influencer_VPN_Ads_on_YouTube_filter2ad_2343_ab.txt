### Informational Sponsorship and Advertisements on YouTube

**A. Overview of Advertisements**

In our dataset, advertisements often convey significant (and sometimes erroneous) technical details and threat information, which may influence viewers' mental models of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

**B. Ads on YouTube**

YouTube advertisements can be broadly categorized into two types: ads served by YouTube and influencer ads. 

- **Ads Served by YouTube**: These are placed on specific user interface elements, typically interrupting videos, with limited control over content by the YouTuber.
- **Influencer Ads**: These are embedded within the video content itself, making them an integral part of the video. In this study, we focus exclusively on influencer ads.

The unique, often deeply personal, relationship between YouTubers and their audiences makes YouTube an ideal platform for influencer advertising [24]. Unlike ads served by YouTube, influencer ads can better target communication to specific audiences [25] and are less susceptible to ad blockers [26].

YouTubers generate revenue from influencer ads through:
1. Direct payment for promoting a product [27].
2. Commissions from sales via coupon codes and affiliate links [28].

Research indicates that influencer ads are more cost-effective and result in higher engagement compared to traditional brand-promoted ads [25]. Factors contributing to the success of influencer ads include social advocacy, trustworthiness, and to a lesser extent, likability and homophily [29].

Despite the benefits, there is a concern about the lack of appropriate disclosure in affiliate marketing, which may violate U.S. law [12]. Mathur et al. found that affiliate-link marketing was widespread on YouTube, often without proper disclosure [12]. Swart et al. later proposed a browser extension to detect and disclose such links [30]. Our study also identifies numerous ads that may violate U.S. law, suggesting the issue extends beyond affiliate links.

**C. Users, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), and VPNs**

Research on the use, misuse, and non-use of PETs, including VPNs, has been extensive [31-35]. Misuses of PETs are often linked to inadequate mental models [31, 34-38]. Interventions are employed to promote correct use when users cannot develop complete, functional mental models of complex technologies [1, 5].

User mental models of VPNs are less researched compared to other PETs like encrypted messaging apps. Namara et al. found that a majority of VPN users use them for non-privacy purposes, such as accessing geo-locked content [38]. However, users who use VPNs for privacy tend to continue using them longer. Other researchers have noted that people use VPNs for increased security and privacy on public networks, as well as to prevent hacks and password leaks [39].

Research on popular privacy-focused VPNs has identified many flaws [9-11, 40-43], leading some researchers to refrain from recommending them as privacy tools [44]. Free VPNs, in particular, have been found to promise security while violating users' privacy [9]. Recent reports suggest that even mainstream paid VPNs, some of which appear in our dataset, may engage in privacy-violating data collection practices [42].

**D. Driving Adoption of Security and Privacy Tools**

Some industries have successfully driven the adoption of PETs without relying heavily on persuasion. For example, Duo attributes the wide-scale adoption of two-factor authentication to companies mandating its use [45]. The 1990s antivirus software boom was driven by distribution through computer and OS manufacturers [46-48]. Companies often use security as a selling point, with varying degrees of success. Apple's "Get a Mac" campaign in the late 2000s highlighted the security advantages of Macs over PCs [49], although recent reports show that Macs are now more targeted by malware developers than PCs [50].

WhatsApp's attempt to convey the benefits of end-to-end encryption to its user base failed, leading to a backlash against its privacy policy [51, 52]. This prompted WhatsApp to redouble its efforts, primarily to retain existing users rather than attract new ones [53].

A different advertising paradigm is emerging with VPN companies. Instead of direct communication from the company, influencers design promotions tailored to their audiences. In this paper, we investigate how these intermediaries persuade their viewers to adopt VPNs and the prevalence of these ads on YouTube. We find that VPN ads likely reach billions of viewers, comparable to ambitious industry efforts at influencing users' understanding of security and privacy tools.

### III. The Dataset

**A. Large-Scale Scrape**

To obtain the dataset, we used random prefix sampling, which theoretically allows us to sample 1/64th (1.6%) of all videos on YouTube. In practice, we sampled 1.5% of all videos, capturing metadata for 86.3 million videos (the representative sample). We then collected additional details for videos with more than 800 views, resulting in the 10.7 million highly viewed videos (the 10M dataset). Within this, we downloaded English subtitles for 1.6 million videos and obtained additional details from the YouTube Data API for a random subset of 195,000 videos. Data collection occurred between August 2020 and March 2021.

We used up to 16 parallel scrapers, dividing all compatible five-character YouTube ID prefixes. For scraping subtitles and additional details, we used a modified version of youtube-dl, an open-source online video downloader. Some scrapers operated through proxies and switched server locations every 10 hours.

**B. Finding Videos with VPN Ads**

To identify videos containing VPN ads, we first filtered the 10M dataset for videos whose English subtitles included the abbreviation "VPN." This resulted in 1,751 videos. Three researchers then applied an open-coding approach to define what constitutes a VPN ad for this study. Our final definition includes all videos that mention VPNs and are affiliated with VPN companies, either through explicit disclosure or undisclosed affiliate links. We validated this definition with Krippendorff’s α of 0.852 [61]. The remaining candidate videos were adjudicated by one researcher, resulting in 359 videos with VPN ads (0.00041% of the representative sample).

**C. Further Filtering for Analysis**

Before conducting an in-depth analysis, we filtered out 116 videos (12.4 million total views) that were not suitable for analysis due to various reasons, such as being entirely about VPNs, removed from YouTube, or containing ads for other security products. We manually analyzed the remaining 243 videos (62.7 million total views), which we call the VPN ad sample.

For each video, we coded:
1. Specific threat models conveyed in the ad (threat-model statements).
2. Additional information not related to threat models (supplemental codes).

We developed a novel codebook structure to capture relationships between entities, dividing each ad into units of analysis and assigning up to four sub-codes: 1) the adversary, 2) the adversary's action, 3) the asset being attacked or defended, and 4) the VPN's action. For example, an ad might claim the VPN "Protects you from . . . people trying to steal your private information." [57] Here, the adversary is "people," the action is "stealing," the asset is "private information," and the VPN's action is "protecting."

This structured approach allows us to capture the relationship among adversaries, threats, and protective measures as described by the ads.
