Certainly! Here's an optimized version of your KQL (Kusto Query Language) query for detecting emails that may be delivering StrRAT malware. This version includes some additional context and formatting to make it more professional and clear.

```kql
// KQL Query to Detect Emails Containing Domains Associated with StrRAT Malware Delivery

EmailUrlInfo
| where UrlDomain has_any (
    'metroscaffingltg.co.uk',
    'pg-finacesolutions.co.uk',
    'jpfletcherconsultancy.co.uk',
    'buildersworlinc.co.uk',
    'bentlyconstbuild.co.uk',
    'alfredoscafeltd.co.uk',
    'zincocorporation.co.uk',
    'playerscircleinc.co.uk',
    'tg-cranedinc.co.uk',
    'adamridley.co.uk',
    'westcoasttrustedtaxis.co.uk',
    'sivospremiumclub.co.uk',
    'gossyexperience.co.uk',
    'jeffersonsandc.co.uk',
    'fillinaresortsltd.co.uk',
    'tk-consultancyltd.co.uk'
)
```

### Explanation:
- **Table**: `EmailUrlInfo` - This table contains information about URLs found in emails.
- **Filter Condition**: `where UrlDomain has_any (...)` - This condition filters the records to include only those where the `UrlDomain` matches any of the specified domains known to be associated with StrRAT malware delivery.

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Alerting**: Consider setting up an alert based on this query to notify you of potential malicious activity.
2. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the list of domains as new ones are identified.
3. **Contextual Information**: You might want to include additional fields in the result set, such as `EmailSender`, `EmailRecipient`, and `EmailSubject`, to provide more context for investigation.

Here's an example of how you can extend the query to include more details:

```kql

    'buildersworlinc.co.uk',
    'bentlyconstbuild.co.uk',
    'alfredoscafeltd.co.uk',
    'zincocorporation.co.uk',
    'playerscircleinc.co.uk',
