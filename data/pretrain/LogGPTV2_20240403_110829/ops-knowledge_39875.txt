User: Please analyze the current state of network security, list possible vulnerabilities and suggested fixes.
Assistant: At present, the global network security situation is still severe. Due to the rapid development and wide application of Internet technology, the means and number of network crimes are increasing. Developed into remote control technologies such as ransomware, mining viruses, DDoS attacks, and botnets. Possible vulnerabilities: 1. Generic Resource Exhaustion Vulnerability (CVE-2018-1000600): This vulnerability involves user-defined domain name resolution, and attackers can use specific DNS requests to bypass certain protection rules and launch attacks. 2. Attacks against cloud servers (CVE-2018-6789): Attackers can send emails with malicious payloads to crash the server, thereby controlling the website and stealing data. 3. Insecure communication protocol (CVE-2018-3991): The attacker can crack the user's account password during FTP transmission, thereby obtaining the user's sensitive information. 4. Insecure web application (CVE-2018-12567): This vulnerability allows attackers to deceive users through the 'https' protocol and obtain sensitive information such as user passwords and credit card information. Suggested fixes: 1. Upgrade the software version used in time, and install the required updates and patches to ensure that the system will not be attacked by known vulnerabilities. 2. When communicating with the Internet, an encryption protocol should be selected as much as possible, and complex and long passwords should be used at the same time. 3. Implement multiple protections for the network security of key systems, such as intrusion detection, firewall, security detection, etc. 4. Strengthen the security of the application and use good encryption technology to ensure the security of the data. 5. Enhance user security awareness, strengthen training and education, improve user security awareness and attention, and prevent social engineering attacks.
