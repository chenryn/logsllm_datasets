### Hacking .NET Applications: The Black Arts

#### Why .NET?
- **Overview**: Understanding the security landscape of .NET applications.
- **Countermeasures**: Exploring defensive strategies and best practices.
- **Skill Level Needed**: Intermediate to advanced knowledge of .NET and security concepts.
- **Applicability**: Techniques discussed may not work on all .NET applications.

### Background
- **How to Attack .NET Applications**: An overview of the tools and methodologies used in attacking .NET applications.
- **Tools and Methodology of Attacking**:
  - **Decompilers**: Tools like IL_Spy, Reflector, and GrayWolf.
  - **Reverse Engineering**: Techniques for understanding and manipulating application logic.
- **Overcoming "Secure" .NET Applications**: Strategies for bypassing common security measures.
- **Building KeyGen/Crack/Hacks/Malware**: Practical examples and demonstrations.
- **Reverse Engineering for Protection**: Using reverse engineering to enhance application security.

### This Will Cover
- **Attacking/Cracking**
  - **In Memory (Runtime)**
  - **On Disk (Static Analysis)**

### Attack Overview
- **Attack on Disk**:
  - **Access Logic**: Gaining access to the application's code and logic.
  - **Debug**: Using debuggers to understand and manipulate the application.
  - **Recompile**: Modifying and recompiling the application.
- **Attack in Memory/Runtime**:
  - **Inject Target App**: Injecting code into a running application.
  - **Edit/Control Structure**: Manipulating the application's structure and behavior.
  - **Decompile**: Decompiling the application to understand its code.
  - **Infect Logic**: Modifying the application's logic to introduce malicious behavior.
  - **Hook Logic**: Hooking into the application's functions to intercept and manipulate data.
  - **Navigate Structure**: Navigating the application's structure to find vulnerabilities.

### Attacking On Disk
- **Demo Tools**:
  - **GrayWolf**
  - **IL_Spy**
  - **Reflector**
- **Decompilers 101**: Introduction to decompilers and their use in static analysis.
- **Attack on Disk 101**:
  - **Decompile**: Extracting source code from compiled binaries.
  - **Infect**: Modifying the extracted code to introduce malicious changes.
  - **Remold Application**: Rebuilding the application with modified code.
  - **Exploit**: Taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the application.
  - **Connect/Open**: Accessing and manipulating the application's code.

### Weak Spots
- **Flip the Check**:
  - Example: Changing `bool Registered = false;` to `bool Registered = true;`
- **Set Value to "True"**:
  - Example: Changing `If(a != b)` to `If(a == b)`
- **Cut the Logic**:
  - Example: Simplifying `string sqlClean(string x) { return x; }`
- **Access Value**:
  - Example: `bool ValidPassword(int x) { ShowKey(Pass); return (x == Pass); }`

### Attack Security
- **Microsoft Media Center**: A case study in cracking a specific application.
- **Crack Password**:
  - Example: Modifying the password check to always return `true`.
- **Registration Check**:
  - **KeyGens and Cracks**: Techniques for generating and cracking license keys.
  - **Public/Private Keys**: Understanding and manipulating key pairs.
  - **Server Call**: Faking server calls to bypass registration checks.

### Protection on Disk
- **Code Obfuscation**: Techniques for making code difficult to read and understand.
- **Shells/Packers/Encrypted Code**: Using shells and packers to protect the application.
- **Logic Obfuscation**: Making the application's logic more complex to deter attackers.
- **Unmanaged Calls**: Using unmanaged code to bypass .NET security.
- **Strong Names**: Using strong names to verify the integrity and origin of assemblies.
- **Signed Code**: Verifying the author and integrity of the code using digital signatures.

### Global Assembly Cache (GAC)
- **What is the GAC?**: An overview of the Global Assembly Cache.
- **Accessing the GAC**: How to access and manipulate the GAC.
- **Attacking from the GAC**: Techniques for modifying and exploiting assemblies in the GAC.
- **Native Images**: Understanding and manipulating native images in the GAC.

### Attacking at Runtime
- **Why at Runtime?**: The importance of runtime attacks in bypassing security.
- **Security Systems**: Bypassing security measures such as hacks, cracks, and malware.
- **Inject at Runtime**: Techniques for injecting code into a running application.
- **Gain Full Access**: Methods for gaining complete control over the application.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Understanding and manipulating the application's logic.
- **Take Out the "Security"**: Disabling or bypassing security features.
- **Control the Program**: Gaining full control over the application's behavior.

### Defending Your Applications
- **Verify Your Applications**: Ensuring the security and integrity of your applications.
- **Crypto and Key Management**: Understanding and managing cryptographic keys.
- **Data Leaks**: Identifying and preventing data leaks.
- **Backdoors**: Detecting and mitigating backdoors in your applications.
- **Threat Level**: Assessing the threat level and taking appropriate defensive measures.
