tors and substations management. To these aims, ITCS per-
forms the following activities: a) remote control of the elec-
tric infrastructure (it receives data and sends commands);
b) co-ordination of the maintenance (it plans the reconﬁgu-
ration actions that can affect generators, substations, loads
and lines); c) collection of the system statistics. There are
several logical components composing ITCS: the protection
system, that is composed by a set of independent (or loosely
connected) local protections, one for each breaker of EI; the
frequency and voltage regulation systems, which try to keep
constant the frequency and the voltage levels inside a piece
of grid; and the tele-operation (or tele-control) systems of
the transmission and distribution grid, which control and
monitor equipments in remote locations.
In this paper we focus the attention on the tele-operation
systems for the distribution grid (named DT OS) and for the
transmission grid (named T T OS), since a failure of these
logical components can affect a large portion of the grid,
also leading to black-out phenomena.
The logical ITCS components interact through a hierar-
chical structure. In Figure 4 we depict a possible logical
structure of T T OS and DT OS. The components LCT
(Local Control system inside T T OS), RT S (Regional
Tele-control System) and N T S (National Tele-control Sys-
tem) of T T OS, and the components LCD (Local Control
system inside DT OS), and AT S (Area Tele-control Sys-
tem) of DT OS differ for their criticality and for the locality
of their decisions.
Different actors (like Power Exchange P E, Energy Au-
thority EA, Network Management System N M S) are
involved in the electric system management and there
can be a necessity to exchange grid status information
and control data over public or private networks (e.g.,
T SOcommN etw and DSOcommN etw). The transmis-
sion and distribution grids are divided in homogeneous re-
gions and areas, respectively. LCT and LCD guarantee
the correct operation of substation equipment and recon-
ﬁgure the substation in case of breakdown of some appa-
ratus. They include the acquisition and control equipment
(sensors and actuators). RT S and AT S monitor their re-
gion and area, respectively, in order to diagnose faults on
the power lines.
In case of breakdowns, they choose the
more suitable corrective actions to restore the functionality
of the grid. Since RT S and AT S are not directly connected
to the substations, the corrective actions to adopt are com-

and delivered by ITCS, for example when ITCS triggers a
grid reconﬁguration for economic optimization; therefore
the state of EI depends on the outputs of ITCS (cyber inter-
dependency). Viceversa, the state of ITCS could be affected
by disruptions in EI (e.g. in case of blackout that leads to a
failure or service degradation of the information infrastruc-
ture), thus revealing a physical interdependency.
3 Interdependencies and failures model of
3.1 Failures model within EI and ITCS
EPS
The characterization of the mutual interdependencies be-
tween ITCS and the controlled EI is a very challenging ac-
tivity, especially considering the various types of acciden-
tal and malicious faults. Such type of analysis can be used
for prevention and limitation of threats and vulnerabilities
propagation, in order to avoid escalating and cascading1
failures that result in outages and blackouts.
An interdependency is a bidirectional relationship be-
tween two infrastructures through which the state of each
infrastructure inﬂuences or is correlated to the state of the
other. As detailed in [12], there are several types of interde-
pendencies: physical (when the state of each infrastructure
is dependent on the material outputs of the other), cyber (if
the state of an infrastructure depends on information trans-
mitted through the information infrastructure), geographic
(if a local environment event can create a state changes in
all the connected infrastructures) and logical (if the state of
each depends on the state of the other via mechanism that is
not physical, cyber or geographical connection).
In this paper the focus is mainly on the cyber and phys-
ical interdependencies. EI requires information transmitted
1An escalating failure occurs when an existing failure in one infras-
tructure exacerbates an independent disruption in another infrastructure,
increasing its severity or the time for recovery and restoration from this
failure. A cascading failure occurs when a disruption in one infrastructure
causes the failure of a component in a second infrastructure.
A disruption (or disturbance or contingency) is the unex-
pected failure or outage of a EI component, such as a gen-
erator, power line, circuit breaker, bus-bar, or other electric
components. The main (electric) disruptions, based on their
effects on (single or multiple) components NS, NG, NL and
AL, could be summarized in:
1. Transient or permanent disconnection of a component
AL, NS,NG or NL with consequent separation of one
or more components from the grid. Transient or per-
manent failed disconnection of a component AL, NS,
NG or NL without isolation from the grid.
2. Transient or permanent overloads of AL, NS, NG or
NL. Unexpected reduction of production of NG. Un-
expected increase or reduction of demand. Voltage col-
lapse. Underfrequency and loss of synchronism.
The failures of the ITCS components can be summarized
in (transient and permanent) omission failure, time failure,
value failure and byzantine failure. Here the focus is on
the failures and not on their causes (internal HW/SW faults,
malicious attacks, etc.).

dencies)

pending on the logical components affected by the failures,
and obviously by the type of the failures (cyber interdepen-
dency). For example, consequences of a failure of the com-
ponent LCT associated to a component NS, NG or NL (see
also Figure 4) can be:
Omission failure of LCT , fail silent LCT . No (reconﬁg-
uration) actions are performed on NS or AL.
Time failure of LCT . The above (reconﬁguration) actions
on NS or AL are performed after a certain delay (or
before the instant of time they are required).
Value failure of LCT . Incorrect closing or opening of the
power lines AL directly connected to the failed com-
ponent is performed.
Failures of the component LCT can also impact on the in-
put values that the components RT S receive from LCT .
These values can be omitted, delayed (or anticipated) or
erroneous. Since reconﬁgurations required by RT S (or
N T S) are actuated by the associated component LCT , a
failure of a component LCT can also impact on the recon-
ﬁgurations required by RT S (or N T S). The failure of the
component RT S (or N T S) corresponds to an erroneous
(request of) reconﬁguration of the state of EI (including
an unneeded reconﬁguration) affecting one or more com-
ponents of the controlled region. The effect of the failure of
RT S (or N T S) on a component N is the same as the failure
of the component LCT associated to the component N. In
the case of Byzantine failure these effects can be different
for each component N. In general, the failure of the compo-
nents LCT , RT S and N T S may depend on the failures of
the components connected to them through a network.
On the other direction (physical interdependency), dis-
ruptions of the EI infrastructure impact on (parts of) the
ITCS system by lessening its functionalities (till complete
failure in the extreme case the disruption is a total blackout
of the power grid).
4 State deﬁnition for EI and ITCS
The description of the infrastructures outlined in Sec-
tions 2.1 and 2.2, together with the analysis of the possible
failure models detailed in Section 3, lead us to derive the
state for EI and ITCS. The state of the Electric Infrastruc-
ture (EI) can be completely described through the physical
parameters associated to each electric equipment (V, F, I, A,
P and Q) and through the topology (T) of the grid. Actu-
ally, the ﬁrst set of parameters deﬁnes the current status of
each EI component, while the topology deﬁnes how such
components are connected together to form the overall EI.
Therefore, the state of EI is an hybrid-state composed by
a discrete part and a continuous one. It can be deﬁned as a
7-tuple (T, V, F, I, A, P, Q), where:
• T represents the topology of the grid, i.e., the compo-
nents NS, NG, NL and AL and their connections (as
shown for example in Figure 2(b)). T could also in-
clude information on the direction of the current ﬂow
on each power line. This information is used to recon-
ﬁgure the topology of the grid. Therefore, T can be
described as an oriented graph where NS, NG and NL
are nodes and AL are arcs.
• V, F, I, A, P and Q are the voltage, the frequency, the
current ﬂow, the angle, the active and reactive power
associated to NS, NG, NL and AL (if applicable).
T represents the discrete part of the EI states, whereas V, F,
I, A, P and Q represent the continuous part of the EI states.
On the contrary, the state of ITCS is discrete, in the sense
that it is only composed by discrete values. Some possible
states are “Working” (ITCS is working properly), “Passive

present), “Omission Failure” (ITCS does not send the com-
mand for the execution of a reconﬁguration action), etc. The
set of possible ITCS states depends on the speciﬁc informa-
tion control system to be analyzed.
The status of EI and ITCS gives a static view of the sys-
tem. In the following Subsection we discuss the dynamic
behavior of EPS, also providing an example of a possible
