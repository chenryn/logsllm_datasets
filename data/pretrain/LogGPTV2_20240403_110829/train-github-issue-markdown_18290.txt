# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
When using dynamic imports with expressions together with
`ContextReplacementPlugin` in order to limit the possible file matches, some
module ids which should deterministic, are actually dependent on the project's
location.  
Meaning two identical projects (code, dependencies, configuration etc..) built
on the same machine have different build outputs based on their location on
the filesystem.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
  * use dynamic imports with expessions 
    * ie: **import(`../i18n/${locale}.json`)**)
  * configure Webpack to use `ContextReplacementPlugin` to limit which JSON files should be bundled 
    * ie: `new webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(/i18n/, regExpForLocales)`
  * build the project for production
  * duplicate the project at another location on the filesystem at a different path root level 
    * ie: `/home/project` vs `/home/work/projects`
  * build the project for production at the new location
  * diff both output bundles, observe that both bundles are different, invalidating the project build's reproducibility

**What is the expected behavior?**
  * both bundles should be identical irrelevant of their location on the filesystem
