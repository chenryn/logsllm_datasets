INCIDENT HANDLING STEPS
6 STEPS ARE DEFINED TO HANDLE SECURITY INCIDENTS
1. Preparation: get ready to handle the incident
2. Identification: detect the incident
3. Containment: limit the impact of the incident
4. Remediation: remove the threat
5. Recovery: recover to a normal stage
6. Lessons learned: draw up and improve the process
IRM provides detailed information for each stepof the incident response process.The steps
come from NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.

PREPARATION
OBJECTIVE: ESTABLISH CONTACTS, DEFINE PROCEDURES, GATHER INFORMATION TO SAVE
TIMEDURINGANINCIDENT.
Contacts
▪ Identifyinternaltechnicalcontacts(securityteam,incidentresponseteam…).
▪ Make sure to have contact points in your public relation team (regulator institutions), human
resourcesteamandlegaldepartment.
▪ Identify external contacts who might be needed, mainly for investigation purposes (like Law
Enforcementforexample).
▪ Prepareinternalandexternalcommunicationstrategy.
▪ DPO,CDO,GDPRcontacts.

IDENTIFICATION
OBJECTIVE: DETECT THE INCIDENT, DETERMINE ITS SCOPE, AND INVOLVE THE
APPROPRIATEPARTIES.
Data leak can occur from anywhere. Remember that the cause of the leakage can be an
individual employee willingly or unwillingly bypassing security issues, or a compromised
computer(i.e.,largescale/ransomware).
1. Detecttheissue
Incidentnotificationprocess:
▪ Internal information can be a good source of detection: employee confidence, security team
identifyingaproblem,etc.
Publicmonitoringtool:
▪ A watch on Internet search engines and public database can be very valuable to detect information
leakage.
▪ Monitorransomwareshaminglistwebsitestodetectpotentialdataleakageincludingthird-parties.
DLP(DataLossPrevention)tool:
▪ IfthereisaDLPtoolinthecompany,itcanprovidevaluableinformationtoincidenthandlersworking
oninformationleakage.
2. Confirmtheissue
Don’t do anything, without a written request from the concerned CISO/person in charge.
Based on your legal team advisory, a written permission from the concerned user might
alsobehandy.
E-Mail:
▪ Thedisclosuresourcecouldhavesentdatausinghiscorporatee-mailaddress.
▪ Onthemessagingsystem,lookfore-mailssenttoorreceivedfromasuspectaccountorwithaspecial

▪ Onthee-mailclientonthedesktopofthesuspect(ifavailable),useatoolwhichallowsyoutosearch
by filtering out the “PRIVATE” flagged e-mails. If you really need to do so, ask the user for a written
agreement,oraskhimtobewithyou.
▪ Whenapplicable,lookthroughrelatedlogfiles.

Browsing:
▪ Datamighthavebeensentonwebmail/forums/dedicatedwebsites.
▪ On the proxy server or SIEM, check the logs relating to the suspect account connections on the
suspectedURLusedtodisclosedata.
▪ On the desktop (if available), check the history of the installed browsers. Remember some people

Externalstoragedevices:
▪ Avariousnumber of devicescanbeusedto store data:USBkeys,CD-ROM,DVD,externalharddisks,
smartphones,memorycards…
▪ Little information will be found concerning data transfer using these devices. The USB key used to
transfer data can be referenced by the operating system. A forensic analysis can confirm the use of
hardwarebutnotthedatatransmitted.
Localfiles:
▪ If nothing has been found yet, there are still chances to find traces in the local file system of the
suspect. Just like for e-mail researches, use a parsing tool which forbids any access to the PRIVATE
zoneoftheuser.Ifyoureallyneedtodoso,actaccordinglytolocalemploymentlaw.

Even when enough evidence has been found, always look for more. It is not because you
provedthatdatagotfraudulentlyfromAtoBwithonemethodthatitwasn’talsosenttoC
with another method. Also don’t forget that someone else could have accessed the
computer. Was the suspected employee actually in front of his computer when the leak
occurred?

CONTAINMENT
OBJECTIVE:MITIGATETHEATTACK’SEFFECTSONTHETARGETEDENVIRONMENT.
▪ Notify the management, legal and public relation/communication team to make sure they are
preparedtodealwithamassiveortargeteddisclosure.
▪ Depending on the leakage vector, block the access to the disclosure URI, the disclosure server, the
disclosuresourceorthedisclosurerecipients.Thisactionmustbedoneonallinfrastructurepoints.
▪ Suspendthelogicalandphysicalcredentialsoftheinsideriftheleakagehasbeenconfirmed.Involve
HRandlegalteambeforeanyaction.
▪ Isolate the computing system(desktop, printer) usedto disclose data in order to perform a forensic
analysis later. This manipulation should be done the hard way: remove the electric plug (and the
batteryincaseofalaptop).
