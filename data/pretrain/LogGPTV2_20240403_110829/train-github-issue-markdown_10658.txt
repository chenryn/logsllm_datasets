Apologies if this is a duplicate or not a bug â€“ I ran into this recently and
figured I should report it.
`iter_content` takes a `chunk_size` argument, which defaults to 1. Various
code snippets on the internet call `request.iter_content()`. This is
incredibly inefficient, because it is using a buffer size of 1 _byte_. I think
`requests` should either a) set `chunk_size` to something more reasonable,
like 2048 or 4096, or b) make `chunk_size` a required argument. (Solution a is
more palatable since it's backwards compatible.)
