Packages that use setup_requires=["numpy"] in their setup.py appear to fail to
build on Windows+Py3.8.
### Reproducing code example:
https://github.com/anntzer/setup_requires-numpy is a minimal repro with just
the following setup.py:
    from setuptools import setup
    setup(
        name="testpkg",
        setup_requires=["numpy"],
    )
and is "built" (`python setup.py build`) on Azure on
{linux,mac,windows}+{py3.7,py3.8}.
The resulting build is at https://dev.azure.com/anntzer/setup_requires-
numpy/_build/results?buildId=158  
As one can see, all builds succeed except windows+Py3.8, which fails with
    Traceback (most recent call last):

        setup(

    The package setup script has attempted to modify files on your system
    that are not within the EasyInstall build area, and has been aborted.
    This package cannot be safely installed by EasyInstall, and may not
    support alternate installation locations even if you run its setup
    script by hand.  Please inform the package's author and the EasyInstall
    maintainers to find out if a fix or workaround is available.
