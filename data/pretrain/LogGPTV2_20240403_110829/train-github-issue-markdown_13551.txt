Packages that specify `setup_requires=["numpy"]` in their `setup.py` file appear to fail to build on Windows with Python 3.8.

### Reproduction Example:
A minimal reproducible example is available at [https://github.com/anntzer/setup_requires-numpy](https://github.com/anntzer/setup_requires-numpy). The repository contains the following `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="testpkg",
    setup_requires=["numpy"],
)
```

This package is built using `python setup.py build` on Azure Pipelines for the following configurations: Linux + Python 3.7, Linux + Python 3.8, macOS + Python 3.7, macOS + Python 3.8, Windows + Python 3.7, and Windows + Python 3.8.

The build results can be found [here](https://dev.azure.com/anntzer/setup_requires-numpy/_build/results?buildId=158).

As you can see, all builds succeed except for the Windows + Python 3.8 configuration, which fails with the following traceback:

```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 3, in <module>
    setup(
  File "C:\hostedtoolcache\windows\Python\3.8.0\x64\lib\site-packages\setuptools\__init__.py", line 144, in setup

distutils.errors.DistutilsError: Setup script exited with error: SandboxViolation: mkdir('C:\\Users\\VSSADM~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\easy_install-0gx4h9jy\\numpy-1.17.3\\build', 511) {}
The package setup script has attempted to modify files on your system
that are not within the EasyInstall build area, and has been aborted.
This package cannot be safely installed by EasyInstall, and may not
support alternate installation locations even if you run its setup
script by hand. Please inform the package's author and the EasyInstall
maintainers to find out if a fix or workaround is available.
```

### Error Message:
The error message is as shown in the traceback above.

### Numpy/Python Version Information:
- Numpy: 1.17.3
- Python: 3.8

This issue specifically affects the combination of Windows and Python 3.8, and it appears to be related to a sandbox violation during the build process.
