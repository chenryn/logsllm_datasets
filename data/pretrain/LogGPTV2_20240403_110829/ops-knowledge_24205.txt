I understand you're encountering an `ImportError: No module named google.protobuf` while attempting to run Google's DeepDream on Python 2.7, using macOS Yosemite 10.10.3. Here are a few steps and suggestions that may help resolve your issue:

### 1. Verify Protobuf Installation
First, ensure that the protobuf library is correctly installed. You mentioned using `sudo install protobuf`, but it seems like you might have used the wrong command. The correct command for installing protobuf via pip is:
```sh
pip install protobuf
```
If you need to use `sudo` (though itâ€™s generally not recommended), you can do:
```sh
sudo pip install protobuf
```

### 2. Check Python Path
Ensure that the protobuf package is installed in the correct location and that Python can find it. You mentioned deploying to `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. You can check if the protobuf package is there by running:
```sh
ls /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ | grep protobuf
```
You should see `google` and `protobuf` directories listed.

### 3. Virtual Environment
Consider using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system-wide packages. You can create a virtual environment and install the required packages there:
```sh
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install protobuf
```

### 4. Check for Conflicting Files
As the assistant suggested, a file named `google.py` in your project directory can cause this issue. Python will try to import from your local `google.py` file instead of the `google` package. Rename or remove the `google.py` file if it exists.

### 5. Update TensorFlow
Ensure that you have the correct version of TensorFlow installed, as some versions may have compatibility issues with older Python versions. You can install TensorFlow for Python 2.7 using:
```sh
pip install tensorflow==1.15
```
TensorFlow 1.15 is the last version to support Python 2.7.

### 6. Debugging Import
Add some debug prints to your script to verify the import path:
```python
import sys
print(sys.path)
try:
    import google.protobuf
except ImportError as e:
    print(e)
```
This will help you see if the expected paths are included in the Python search path.

### 7. Reinstall Protobuf
If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try uninstalling and reinstalling protobuf:
```sh
pip uninstall protobuf
pip install protobuf
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError: No module named google.protobuf` and successfully run Google's DeepDream. If the problem persists, please provide more details about your setup and any error messages you encounter.
