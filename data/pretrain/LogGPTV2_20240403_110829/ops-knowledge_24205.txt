User: I am trying to run Google's deep dream. For some odd reason I keep getting

ImportError: No module named google.protobuf

after trying to import protobuf. I have installed protobuf using sudo install protobuf. I am running python 2.7 OSX Yosemite 10.10.3.
I think it may be a deployment location issue but i cant find anything on the web about it. Currently deploying to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
Assistant: I had this problem to when I had a google.py file in my project files.
It is quite easy to reproduce.
main.py: import tensorflow as tf
google.py: print("Protobuf error due to google.py")
Not sure if this is a bug and where to report it.
