Parameters
Parameter
Description
/x:
Specifies the .xml file to be viewed. This parameter must be specified.
/s:
Specifies the .xsl transform to apply to the .xml file as part of the rendering process. This parameter is optional for SCW .xml files. When the view command is used to render a SCW .xml file, it will automatically try to load the correct default transform for the specified .xml file. If an .xsl transform is specified, the transform must be written under the assumption that the .xml file is in the same directory as the .xsl transform.
/?
Displays help at the command prompt.
Example
To view Policyfile.xml by using the Policyview.xsl transform, type:
scwcmd view /x:C:\policies\Policyfile.xml /s:C:\viewers\Policyview.xsl
