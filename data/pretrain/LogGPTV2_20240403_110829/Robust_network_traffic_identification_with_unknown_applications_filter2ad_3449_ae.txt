ability of classiﬁers that can be used to indicate when retraining
is necessary. The ﬁrst is the number of ﬂows not assigned a
label. If this number increases, it indicates a need for classi-
ﬁer retraining so underrepresented ﬂow types can be captured
and classiﬁcation accuracy improved. The second measure is
the average distance of new ﬂows to their nearest cluster mean.
A signiﬁcant increase in the average distance indicates the need
for retraining.
We plan to extend this work in the future and address the
problem of changing class distribution by developing new
strategies for system updates and classiﬁer retraining. One
idea is to count the ﬂows of any known classes recognized
by semi-automatic identiﬁcation during a system update. If
the number increases, this indicates class distributions of the
corresponding known classes have changed and the trafﬁc
classiﬁer should be retrained. In other words, when changed
Fig. 11. Error estimation.
We perform a number of trafﬁc classiﬁcation experiments
to verify the theoretical analysis. The experiments were
conducted on the experimental dataset without considering
zero-day trafﬁc. Random forest was applied for supervised
trafﬁc classiﬁcation. The BoF-based method was implemented
by combining the random forest algorithm and the majority
vote rule. The classiﬁcation error was used to measure the
trafﬁc classiﬁcation performance. Fig. 11 shows the actual
error rates versus the estimated error rates. The results show
the estimated BoF error rate using (12) can match the actual
BoF error rate a lot better than the error rate estimated using
(10). In other words, given the ﬂow error rate
, we can
accurately estimate the BoF error rate according to the average
number of sub-bags in a BoF. We observed that in the four real
trafﬁc traces, the average number of sub-bags in BoFs,
was
always larger than 2. Therefore, the BoF model can effectively
incorporate ﬂow correlation into trafﬁc identiﬁcation,
thus
strongly supporting the new scheme presented in this paper.
Based on the above analysis, one idea is to randomly se-
lect a ﬂow to represent a sub-bag to speed up the proposed
RTC scheme for practical applications. For example, there are
638 388 ﬂows, 64 444 BoFs, and 165 858 sub-bags in our com-
plex trafﬁc dataset. If we apply the idea of sub-bag, our scheme
needs to classify only 165 858 ﬂows instead of the whole dataset
(638 388 ﬂows) before prediction aggregation. Therefore, the
classiﬁcation time may reduce to about one fourth of that used
by the original scheme. We have evaluated the performance of

VII. CONCLUSION
This paper addresses the new problem of zero-day appli-
cations in Internet trafﬁc classiﬁcation. Conventional trafﬁc
classiﬁcation methods suffer from poor performance when
zero-day applications are present due to misclassiﬁcation of
zero-day trafﬁc into predeﬁned known classes. We proposed
a novel robust trafﬁc classiﬁcation scheme, RTC, which can
identify zero-day trafﬁc as well as accurately classify the trafﬁc
generated by predeﬁned application classes. The proposed
scheme has three important modules: unknown discovery,
BoF-based trafﬁc classiﬁcation, and system update. In partic-
ular, we presented a formal analysis on the performance beneﬁt
of ﬂow correlation compared to trafﬁc classiﬁcation. A new
optimization method was developed to intelligently tune the
parameter of the proposed RTC scheme. To evaluate the new
scheme, a large number of well-designed experiments were car-
ried out on real-world trafﬁc traces. The results demonstrated
that the proposed RTC scheme signiﬁcantly outperformed four
state-of-the-art methods.
