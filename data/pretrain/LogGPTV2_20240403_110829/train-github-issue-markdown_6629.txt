    When trying to parse a huge csv file(450MB) the memory increase at 1.2GB, with a spike
    at 1.6GB. The amount of time to finish the program is ~ 1,30 minutes.
    OS: mac osx
    go version :1.2, 64biti
    code here: http://play.golang.org/p/jrVSqCcMpQ
    The csv file has 450MB and ~ 1 milion rows. The code just print in terminal the current
    row.
    The csv has some errors inside, like missing comma, or spaces. 
    When I run the program, it stops for 10 seconds and then the memory increase from 600MB
    to 1.6GB then, remain at 1.2GB.
