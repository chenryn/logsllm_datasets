7.4 Main ﬁndings and implications
We describe a new targeted probing technique called
POPsicle that is designed to reveal and conﬁrm the pres-
ence and location of physical infrastructure such as POPs.
To evaluate our method, we used publicly accessible looking
glass servers deployed at IXPs, and made a custom deploy-
ment of POPsicle at the Equinix Chicago IXP. POPsicle
ﬁnds 2.4x more physical nodes than Ark probes, and in our
custom deployment in Chicago, POPsicle ﬁnds nearly all
POPs identiﬁed in the Atlas physical topologies. In a case
study of Cogent’s network, POPsicle identiﬁed more than
90% of the POPs known through Atlas as well as through
the recently described technique based on using reverse DNS
records [21]. Moreover, it found many more POPs than Ark
probes, or the most recent Rocketfuel measurements.
Overall, our results show that an IXP deployment pro-
vides a prime location from which to launch targeted topol-
ogy discovery probes.
Since Rocketfuel maps are com-
monly used in networking studies that require realistic
and representative network topologies, we view this deploy-
ment paradigm as having signiﬁcant potential for generat-
ing machine-readable topological information on an on-going
basis. We plan to investigate the possibility for additional
IXP deployments and a full-ﬂedged system for generating
up-to-date network topology data in future work.
The peering model in which IXPs operate is diﬀerent
across diﬀerent continents. For instance, an IXP in Eu-
rope is completely diﬀerent from an IXP in North America.
On one hand the peering model in North America typically
involves a commercial colo-operator who also operates the
peering equipment. On the other hand, the exchange points
in Europe tend to be non-proﬁt, community-based organiza-
tions, and the colocation and peering equipment operators
391are diﬀerent [8]. We believe that such a peering model will
lead to diﬀerences on the results that we observe for net-
works in our study compared to networks in Europe.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The high level objective of this paper is to move closer to
the goal of having comprehensive and accurate maps of the
Internet’s topology that can be applied to a wide range of
problems. The starting point of our study is to understand
how physical and network-layer maps diﬀer. To that end, we
compare large repositories of physical and network maps and
ﬁnd that physical maps typically reveal a much larger num-
ber of nodes (e.g., POPs and hosting infrastructure). For
the selected networks, we ﬁnd that: (i) the physical maps
typically show many more nodes/links than the network-
layer maps, (ii) there is often a high amount of overlap in
nodes/links that appear in both data sets, and (iii) network-
layer maps sometimes include some nodes/links that are not
in physical maps due to incomplete or out-of-date published
topologies.
These results motivate the development of probing tech-
niques for targeting the identiﬁcation of nodes with known or
suspected physical locations. We develop a layer 1-informed
heuristic algorithm for probe source-destination selection
called POPsicle that identiﬁes 2.4 times as many nodes as
standard probing methods. Finally, we identify the fact that
sources co-located as IXPs can be used to amplify POPsicle-
based probing since an IXP-based vantage point can be con-
sidered to reside within all of the service providers that peer
at the IXP. To that end, we deployed POPsicle at a real IXP
and found that it ﬁnds almost all POPs compared to Atlas,
and additional POPs compared with Ark.
In future work, we plan to use POPsicle to more broadly
conﬁrm and map network-layer nodes by exploiting addi-
tional available IXP-based VPs and by deploying it to new
IXPs. We also intend to examine potential eﬃciency gains
in POPsicle’s algorithm by more aggressively pruning the
search space of destination VPs. Future eﬀorts will include
benchmarking versus simple probing methods and more tar-
geted approaches (like iPlane [33]) that will enable us to
reason about and quantify the eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of
the tool in a broader deployment. Lastly, we are consider-
ing how to fully automate and integrate POPsicle with the
Internet Atlas in order to accurately and quickly assemble
multi-layer maps of network service providers.
