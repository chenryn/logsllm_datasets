A very handy feature in Notepad++: one can just open a new editing tab, or
multiple ones, cut and paste stuff, or scribble a few notes.  
Upon closing the application or shutting down the computer, instead of the
usual "Do you want to save/not save/cancel" (as vsCode does), all those
unsaved and unnamed files are simply saved to a temp location by the app, and
restored in the same state upon next start.
