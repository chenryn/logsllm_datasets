### Bluetooth Basics
- **Not 802.11!** Bluetooth is not a relative of 802.11.
- **Cable Replacement Technology:** Designed for low power consumption in embedded devices.
- **Proliferation:** More Bluetooth (BT) radios exist than 802.11 radios, found in phones, headsets, laptops, mice, and keyboards.
- **Architecture:** Master/Slave architecture.

### Bluetooth Protocol
- **Frequency Band:** Uses the 2.4 GHz ISM band, the same as 802.11b/g.
- **Power Levels:**
  - **Class 3 (1mW):** Most common for consumer devices.
  - **Class 1 (100mW):** Some high-power devices.
- **Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS):**
  - Uses a predefined hopping pattern.
  - Historically, FHSS was considered a security mechanism.
  - Resists interference with 1 MHz wide channels, hopping every 625 microseconds.
- **Protocol Stack:**
  - A complex stack spanning from Layer 1 to Layer 7.
  - Key features include RF-level sync, inquiry/request, service discovery, and low power modes.

### Bluetooth Security
- **Pairing:**
  - Uses a shared secret (PIN) to exchange random numbers and form a key.
  - This key is used to derive session keys for future communications.
  - Used for trusted communications.
- **Authentication/Authorization:**
  - Per connection and per service.
- **Encryption:**
  - Optional, left to the developer/user to decide.
- **Security Concerns:**
  - All security features are optional, leading to potential vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.

### Bluetooth Profiles
- **Profiles:** Exist to ease interoperability.
  - Examples include keyboard, file transfer, handsfree, and headset profiles.

### Bluetooth vs. 802.11b
- **Stakes:**
  - Compromising 802.11 security provides network access.
  - Compromising BT security gives direct access to application-level functionality.
- **Personal Information:**
  - BT devices often contain more personalized information like phone conversations and calendar data.
  - More interesting for executives than general users.

### Discovery of 802.11
- **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS):**
  - Transmitters stay in the same "place" within a channel, making them easy to find.
  - Channel switching can be managed by hardware (Cisco) or firmware (Prism 2).
- **Beacons:**
  - Broadcast "I'm here" every 100ms.
  - Can be turned off for cloaking, but this does not fool advanced tools like Kismet or Airsnort.
- **Regular Traffic:**
  - Windows machines generate a lot of noise.
  - Frequent traffic regardless of the operating system.

### Discovery of Bluetooth
- **FHSS Challenges:**
  - Harder to find due to the need to align with the hopping pattern.
  - BT uses half the normal hop time, taking 2.5 to 10 seconds to find a known device.
- **Discoverable Devices:**
  - Respond to inquiry requests.
- **Non-Discoverable Devices:**
  - Must be directly probed by MAC address.
  - Little to no traffic in low power mode, making it hard to synchronize on the hopping pattern.
- **Advanced RF Gear:**
  - Can find and intercept traffic, but standard cards cannot do this currently.

### Bluetooth Attacks
- **Interception During Pairing:**
  - Brute force attacks to guess the PIN and recover the key.
  - Poorly developed software and bad defaults (e.g., file sharing without AA/E in discoverable mode) are common.
- **Tracking:**
  - Even Class 3 devices can be intercepted at a distance.
  - Commodity gear can track BT-enabled devices like an RFID tag.

### Bluetooth Wardriving
- **Current Tools:**
  - Typically involve walking around and hitting the "scan" button on BT driver UI.
  - Does not find non-discoverable devices.
  - New tools are needed to catch on.
- **Voyeuristic Appeal:**
  - Similar to 802.11 wardriving, increasing popularity will push developers and users to improve security.

### Redfang
- **Released by @Stake in Spring 2003.**
- **Functionality:**
  - Looks for devices that do not want to be discovered.
  - Brute forces through MAC addresses, rotating through the last three octets.
  - FHSS synchronization can take ~10 seconds per MAC, making it a time-consuming process.

### Bluesniff
- **Website:** [http://bluesniff.shmoo.com/](http://bluesniff.shmoo.com/)
- **Our Tool:**
  - Provides a user interface.
  - Front-end for Redfang.
  - Also finds devices in discoverable mode.
  - Making BT wardriving easier and more efficient will raise awareness of BT security issues.

### Future Work
- **Integration:**
  - Integration with WiFi scanning tools like Airsnort.
- **Scanning Methods:**
  - Development of new scanning methods.
