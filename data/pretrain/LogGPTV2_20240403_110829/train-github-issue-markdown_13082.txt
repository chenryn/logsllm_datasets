**Affected Symfony Version(s):** 4.1.0

**Description:**
When using the new `name_prefix` option, routes are generated both with and without the specified prefix.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. In the `config/routes.yaml` file, add a prefix for a controller folder as follows:
    ```yaml
    admin:
        resource: ../src/Controller
        type: annotation
        name_prefix: admin_
    ```

2. Run the `debug:router` command to list all the registered routes.

3. You will observe that a route named `dashboard` is created twice: once with the prefix (`admin_dashboard_index`) and once without the prefix (`dashboard`).

**Expected Output:**
```plaintext
------------------------------------------------------ -------- -------- ------ -----------------------------------------
  Name                                                   Method   Scheme   Host   Path
------------------------------------------------------ -------- -------- ------ -----------------------------------------
  dashboard                                              ANY      ANY      ANY    /
  admin_dashboard_index                                  ANY      ANY      ANY    /
```

**Actual Output:**
The `dashboard` route is listed twice, indicating that it has been generated both with and without the `name_prefix`.

This issue affects the consistency and predictability of route naming, which can lead to unexpected behavior in applications.
