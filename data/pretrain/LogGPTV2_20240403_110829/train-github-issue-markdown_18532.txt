    Hi,
    again a bug which doesn't need fixing right now, but in a long run.
    It would be good to be more FHS and distributions friendly, that means at least:
    - honor libexecdir (binary architecture files) and datadir (documentation, etc.)
    - allow to have standard library files to be read only (mostly goinstall issues)
    - install additional packages to /usr/local/golang (f.e.)
    - allow to have more than one path in $GOROOT (something like $PYTHONPATH, etc.), so the
    users can install packages/libraries to their home directories (and godoc, goinstall,
    etc. would know about that).
    There's probably more, but it will probably pop-up during the time.
