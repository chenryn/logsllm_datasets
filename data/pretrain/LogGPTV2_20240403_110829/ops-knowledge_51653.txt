User: I am trying to come out with a small python script to monitor the battery state of my ubuntu laptop and sound alerts if it's not charging as well as do other stuff (such as suspend etc).
I really don't know where to start, and would like to know if there is any library for python i can use.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Assistant: The the "power" library on pypi is a good bet, it's cross platform too.
