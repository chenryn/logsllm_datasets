User: Please provide a computer network performance test plan, including testing network bandwidth, latency and throughput.
Assistant: Computer network performance test plan: 1. Test network bandwidth - tool selection: iperf, Speedtest, etc. - steps: install iperf on the client and server respectively, send data packets of specified size to the server through the client, and test the transmission rate and bandwidth. -Precautions: Make sure that the client and server are under the same network, and close other applications and network connections before testing. 2. Test network delay-tool selection: ping, traceroute, etc.-steps: use the ping command to test the network delay; use the traceroute command to test the path and delay of the data packet to the destination. - Note: Make sure the destination is reachable and the network connection is normal. At the same time, multiple tests need to be carried out, and the average value is taken as the final result. 3. Test network throughput - Tool selection: ttcp, netperf, etc. - Steps: Install ttcp and other tools on the client and server respectively, and test by sending data packets of a specified size and simulating multi-user concurrency. -Precautions: Close other applications and network connections before testing, and multiple tests are required, and the average value is taken as the final result.
