User: How to set user permission control to ensure system security and avoid data leakage?
Assistant: 1. The principle of least privilege: limit the privileges to the minimum scope, and only grant the minimum privileges that users need to complete the task. This can effectively reduce the user's operation range, prevent malicious user behavior and reduce system risk. 2. Role permission management: When controlling permissions for multiple users, it is more efficient to use roles for permission control. By specifying a set of permissions for each role, and then assigning different roles to different users, you can simplify permissions management and ensure that each user is only granted the permissions relevant to their job. 3. Restricted access control: Access to different modules should be restricted, including files, databases, and network resources in the system. Only authorized users can access and modify data, and other users have no access. 4. Strong password policy: Passwords are the first line of defense to protect system security. User passwords should be generated by strong password policies, including password length, letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, user passwords should be changed periodically, and weak passwords should be prohibited. 5. Session management: Session management is the relatively difficult part, which means limiting the number of users who can access the system. In session management, we can limit the number of sessions a user has open at the same time and automatically log out inactive sessions. 6. Security audit: By auditing user activities, the behavior of users and their accounts can be tracked and abnormal behaviors can be found in time. Audit records include user logins, access and edit data, and more. This will help improve system security and better protect data. 7. Data backup: Back up important data in time to prevent data loss and system failure. This keeps data safe and prevents damage due to data loss.
