Question: A user is required to authorize kernel extensions on their Mac. Identify the correct sequence of actions and conditions that apply to user-approved kernel extension loading based on the macOS version.
"A": "On macOS 10.15 or later, system extensions can be managed in user space, eliminating the need for kernel extensions and thus bypassing the authorization process.",
"B": "For macOS 10.13.2 and later, kernel extensions can automatically load without user consent if specified via mobile device management (MDM) on an MDM-enrolled Mac.",
"C": "On macOS 11, kernel extensions can be loaded on demand at any time during system operation, provided they have been previously approved by the user.",
"D": "For macOS 10.13 and later, user approval is required to load new kernel extensions, and administrator authorization is needed to approve them."
