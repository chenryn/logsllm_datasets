### Issue Description

When using the "TAB" key to navigate and select a checkbox, it appears as shown in Picture 1. However, when setting the focus on the checkbox programmatically, the visual effect is not applied, and the checkbox looks like Picture 2. The same issue occurs when setting the checkbox's state programmatically.

**Picture 1:**

I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior
The checkbox should appear as in Picture 1, even when the focus is set programmatically.

### Current Behavior
The checkbox appears as in Picture 2 when the focus is set programmatically.

### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Create a checkbox with a reference:
   ```jsx
   <Checkbox
     ref={(ref) => { this.myReference = ref; }}
   />
   ```
2. Set up a timer to wait a few seconds before setting the focus:
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => {
     this.myReference.focus();
   }, 3000);
   ```

**Note:** I attempted to create a reproducible example using CodeSandbox but was unable to get it working.

### Environment
