Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the log line template:

```
Connection request from old client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>; will be dropped if server is in read-only mode
```

This version clearly indicates that `<IP_ADDRESS>` and `<PORT>` are placeholders for the specific IP address and port number, respectively. Additionally, "r-o" has been expanded to "read-only" for better clarity.
