The title says everything. If you have several files open, and press CTRL-O,
at the moment the open dialog will default to "Recently Used". However, it
makes a _lot_ of sense to default, as a starting point, to the directory where
the file currently viewed is.
For example if you are working on the file `youtRepo/auth/button/facebook.js`,
and you want to open `youtRepo/auth/button/local.js`, you should be able to
press CTRL-O and find yourself in `youtRepo/auth/button/`. Again, this is what
happens in Sublime and I find it immensely helpful.
I tried to do it myself, but I am not familiar with Atom's code. However, the
relevant lines seem to be
https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/browser/atom-
application.coffee#L225-L227 and
https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/browser/atom-
application.coffee#L171.
