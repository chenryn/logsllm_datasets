When wiretaps go bad...
“Due to the improper 
minimization of calls, 
creating ‘gaps’ throughout 
the majority of calls, and 
preventing relevant 
conversations from being 
heard in their full context, 
Blagojevich requests that 
all wiretapped recordings 
be suppressed...”

Wiretapping, Unaccountably
• United States wiretaps cannot demonstrate correct 
behavior or detect incorrect behavior.
• Wiretap targets can take active countermeasures to 
obscure communication or corrupt wiretap 
transcripts.
• Violation of wiretap laws could render transcripts 
inadmissible in federal trials.
• Citizens need stronger assurance that wiretaps were 
legally authorized and employed.

Accountable Wiretapping
• Our work demonstrates that wiretap events can be 
safely logged in a privacy preserving manner.
• Our architecture assumes a potentially untrusted 
storage service that:
(i) Never obtains access to plaintext wiretap records
(ii) Cannot determine the number or scope of wiretaps orders
• In spite of this, our storage can prove to auditors that 
it has correctly recorded all encrypted data.

Background: Lawful Access
• Modern United States wiretaps were established by 
the 1994 U.S. Communications Assistance for Law 
Enforcement Act (CALEA) and implemented via the 
2003 ANSI J-STD-025 (“J-Standard”) speciﬁcation.
• Two forms of wiretap order: pen registers allow access 
to call metadata, full audio interception orders allow law 
enforcement to access call content.
• CALEA wiretaps lack audit features, complicating the 
process of generating the required annual wiretap 
report.

Background: Can They Hear Me Now?
• Call Data Channel (CDC) Resource Exhaustion: 
wiretap targets can generate events at a rate that 
overwhelm the channel, preventing call data from being 
recorded.
• Injecting Confusion & Uncertainty: targets can deny 
reconstruction of trafﬁc ﬂows and craft packets that 
insert non-existent correspondence into wiretap 
transcripts.

Design: Threat Model
• Wiretap Target:  may attempt denial-of-service attacks 
(Completeness) on the wiretap resource channels.
• Unauthorized Wiretapper:  may issue illegal wiretap 
orders (Total Reporting), or use a legal wiretap outside 
of the valid date range (Date Compliance).
• Dishonest Log:  may attempt to read records 
(Conﬁdentiality), discover the existence of a wiretap 
order (Unlinkability) or tamper with records (Integrity).

The accountant can use aggregate block sequence 
numbers to conﬁrm that no records were omitted.

The accountant subtracts the sequence numbers
from the sum of the previous sequence numbers.

Security Analysis
• Detecting Denial-of-Service:  our architecture can 
detect lost messages through redundant storage and 
sequence numbering.
• Detecting Unauthorized Wiretaps:  our architecture 
can detect unauthorized wiretaps whose data is 
relayed through the Encryptor.
• Handling a Malicious Log: wiretap records’ 
conﬁdentiality and privacy are handled through 
encryption of call and aggregation data.  If the LOG 
attempts to modify or omit records, it will be evident 
in the accounting audit.

Evaluation: Microbenchmarks
• We implemented our 
architecture using an 
Asterisk telephone 
softswitch.
• Our Implementation’s 
Encryptor throughput 
was 30.53 events per 
second with 1024-bit 
aggregate block size.

• On one desktop, our

this at less than 3.2%

Evaluation: Additional Calculations
• In 2008, there were 21,000 
pen registers.  Our 
implementation would 
require three commodity 
machines to handle this load.
• In 2003, ATT handled 3,500 
calls per second.  Our 
implementation could handle 
10% of this trafﬁc on a single 
multicore machine.
