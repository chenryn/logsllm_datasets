### Abstract
This paper introduces a novel approach to wiretapping that ensures accountability and privacy. Our work demonstrates that wiretap events can be safely logged in a privacy-preserving manner, even when the storage service is untrusted. The proposed architecture provides strong assurances that wiretaps are legally authorized and correctly employed.

### Introduction
Wiretapping is a critical tool for law enforcement, but it often lacks the necessary safeguards to ensure proper use and compliance with legal requirements. Current systems in the United States cannot demonstrate correct behavior or detect incorrect behavior, leading to potential violations of wiretap laws and the possibility of transcripts being inadmissible in federal trials. This paper presents an accountable wiretapping system that addresses these issues.

### Background: Lawful Access
Modern U.S. wiretaps were established by the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) and implemented via the 2003 ANSI J-STD-025 specification. There are two types of wiretap orders: pen registers, which allow access to call metadata, and full audio interception orders, which provide access to call content. However, CALEA wiretaps lack audit features, complicating the generation of required annual wiretap reports.

### Threats to Wiretapping
1. **Resource Exhaustion**: Wiretap targets can generate events at a rate that overwhelms the Call Data Channel (CDC), preventing call data from being recorded.
2. **Confusion and Uncertainty**: Targets can deny reconstruction of traffic flows and craft packets that insert non-existent correspondence into wiretap transcripts.

### Design Overview
Our design involves a secure logging mechanism that ensures the integrity and confidentiality of wiretap records. The system assumes an untrusted storage service that:
- Never obtains access to plaintext wiretap records.
- Cannot determine the number or scope of wiretap orders.

Despite this, the storage service can prove to auditors that it has correctly recorded all encrypted data.

### System Architecture
- **Wiretap Target**: May attempt denial-of-service attacks on the wiretap resource channels.
- **Unauthorized Wiretapper**: May issue illegal wiretap orders or use a legal wiretap outside the valid date range.
- **Dishonest Log**: May attempt to read records, discover the existence of a wiretap order, or tamper with records.

### Protocol Details
#### Event Logging
- **Encryptor-to-Log Message**: Each message includes a wiretap event, record key, event count, hash of the event, and an aggregate block.
- **Encryption and Signing**: Messages are encrypted and signed to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

#### Court Audits
- **Audit Request**: The court issues a request for records associated with a specific wiretap order.
- **Record Retrieval**: The log returns the requested records, and the court verifies their integrity and completeness.

#### Accounting Audits
- **Aggregation Blocks**: Aggregation blocks contain counters encrypted with the Paillier system, allowing the accountant to verify the completeness of the records.
- **Sequence Numbers**: Sequence numbers are used to confirm that no records were omitted.

### Security Analysis
- **Denial-of-Service Detection**: Redundant storage and sequence numbering help detect lost messages.
- **Unauthorized Wiretap Detection**: The system can detect unauthorized wiretaps whose data is relayed through the Encryptor.
- **Malicious Log Handling**: Encryption and auditing mechanisms ensure that any attempts to modify or omit records will be detected.

### Evaluation
- **Microbenchmarks**: Implemented using an Asterisk telephone softswitch, our system achieved a throughput of 30.53 events per second with a 1024-bit aggregate block size.
- **University Traffic Test**: Using anonymized data from a major university, our system handled the busiest 10-minute window with less than 3.2% maximum throughput.
- **Scalability**: In 2008, there were 21,000 pen registers. Our implementation would require three commodity machines to handle this load. In 2003, AT&T handled 3,500 calls per second, and our system could handle 10% of this traffic on a single multicore machine.

### Conclusion
In this work, we have made the following contributions:
- Developed an attacker model for accountable wiretapping.
- Introduced new protocols to enable trustworthy wiretap auditing.
- Developed a minimal-impact retrofit for current interception systems.
- Demonstrated that all U.S. pen register traffic can be handled on a few commodity machines.
