When using the `Chip` element, behavior differs in browser. While in Chrome it
has width calculated based on label and avatar, in MS Edge the element is 100%
width. I did a CodeSandbox snippet to reproduce it.
## Expected Behavior
The `Chip` should be as narrow as its content, like it does in Chrome
## Current Behavior
On MS Edge (versions: Microsoft Edge 41.16299.15.0; Microsoft EdgeHTML
16.16299) the `Chip` element is full width
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. CodeSandbox snippet
  2. Add a `Chip` element to App
  3. The rendering differs in Chrome and Edge
  4. Wrapping Chip with `inline-flex` container (e.g. `Badge` or custom div) fixes an issue.
## Context
I'm rendering a statistic page, where `Avatar` shows ID and `label` displays
aggregation data. I show each chip on new line (in a narrow `Grid` element) so
it's not a big problem, but in this case Avatar is not left-most.
