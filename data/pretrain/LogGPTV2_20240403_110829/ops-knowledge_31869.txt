User: There is a web application running on your server, how to achieve load balancing of the application and prevent a single server from bearing too much pressure?
Assistant: To achieve application load balancing, the following methods can be used: 1. Hardware load balancer: use special hardware devices to achieve load balancing, such as F5, Netscaler, etc. 2. Software load balancer: Use software programs to achieve load balancing, such as Nginx, HAProxy, etc. 3. DNS load balancing: DNS servers are used to distribute user requests and forward requests to different servers, but this method is vulnerable to attacks. 4. In-program load balancing: Write load-balancing code in the application to distribute requests from users. The methods to prevent a single server from bearing excessive pressure are as follows: 1. Add more servers: expand the server capacity through horizontal expansion and increase the number of servers to share the server pressure. 2. Use cache: Use cache technology to cache data in memory, reduce database operations, and improve page performance and response speed. 3. Compress data: Compress the transmitted data to reduce the transmission time and volume. 4. Use reverse proxy: forward the request to other servers for processing, and share the pressure to other servers. 5. Message queue: use asynchronous method to process some time-consuming operations, such as sending emails, SMS, etc., which can reduce the load on the server while avoiding congestion.
