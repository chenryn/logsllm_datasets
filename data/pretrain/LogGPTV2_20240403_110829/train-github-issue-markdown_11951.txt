Doing a make in the kubernetes source tree produces this error when building
with a system version of go:
go install runtime: mkdir /usr/lib/golang/pkg/linux_amd64_cgo/: permission
denied
The build shouldn't be trying to install into system directories. The error is
traced is this line:
'CGO_ENABLED=0 go install -installsuffix cgo "${goflags[@]:+${goflags[@]}}"
-ldflags "${version_ldflags}" "${binary}"' exited with status 1
Which seems to have come from commit `9a901ed`.
