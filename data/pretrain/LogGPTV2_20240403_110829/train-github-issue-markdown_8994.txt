Looking at the other tickets related to this issue, it appear that it was
fixed and then the fix for whatever reason was reverted.
    img {
      max-width: 100%;
      vertical-align: middle;
      border: 0;
      -ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;
    }
Max width interferes with how google maps sets image sprites in the ui. The
image is placed within a div and positioned with absolute positioning. Setting
max-width on the image, forces the image to a width of its parent even though
its suppose to be larger.
I suspect there is a purpose to having max width in the image tag (responsive
design?) so i would suggest the following override to prevent this from being
an issue in the future. It does rely on Google not changing its CDN path, but
its the only unique identifier within the Google Maps DOM that I have found.
    img[src^="http://maps.gstatic.com/"] {
        max-width: none;
    }
