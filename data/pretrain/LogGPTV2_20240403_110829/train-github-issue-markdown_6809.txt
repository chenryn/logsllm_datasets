When defining a route like this:
    /foo/{param}
with a default value for param, you can omit the param and Symfony will match
a URL like `/foo`. But it won't match `/foo/`.
Would it make sense to allow it? What are the consequences on BC?
Or do we need to introduce a special syntax for optional parameters:
    /foo/{?param}
    /foo{/?param}
