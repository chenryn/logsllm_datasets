exhibit better latency and throughput characteristics when compared with BEP
routes. The key reasons include shorter paths and lower loss rates compared to
the BEP transits. Although limited in scale, our work highlights the need for
more transparency and access to open measurement platforms by all the entities
involved in interconnecting enterprises with multiple clouds.

A.1 Representation of Results
Distributions in this paper are presented using letter-value plots [31]. Letter-
value plots, similar to boxplots, are helpful for summarizing the distribution of
data points but oﬀer ﬁner details beyond the quartiles. The median is shown
using a dark horizontal line and the 1/2i quantile is encoded using the box
width, with the widest boxes surrounding the median representing the quartiles,
the 2nd widest boxes corresponding to the octiles, etc. Distributions with low
variance centered around a single value appear as a narrow horizontal bar while
distributions with diverse values appear as vertical bars.
Throughout this paper we try to present full distributions of latency when it is
illustrative. Furthermore, we compare latency characteristics of diﬀerent paths
using the median and variance measures and speciﬁcally refrain from relying
on minimum latency as it does not capture the stability and dynamics of this
measure across each path.
A.2 Preliminary results on E2C perspective
We emulate an enterprise leveraging multi-clouds by connecting a cloud router
in the Phoenix, AZ region to a physical server hosted within a colocation facility
in Phoenix, AZ.
TPP Routes Oﬀer Better Latency than BEP Routes. Figure 6a shows
the distribution of latency for our measured E2C paths. We observe that TPP
routes consistently outperform their BEP counterparts by having a lower baseline
of latency and also exhibiting less variation. We observe a median latency of
11 ms, 20 ms, and 21 ms for TPP routes towards GCP, AWS, and Azure VM
instances in California, respectively. We also observe symmetric distributions
on the reverse path but omit the results for brevity. In the case of our E2C
paths, we always observe direct peerings between the upstream provider (e.g.,
Cox Communications (AS22773)) and the CP network. Relying on bdrmapIT to
infer the peering points from the traceroutes associated with our E2C paths, we
measure the latency on the peering hop. Figure 6b shows the distribution of the
latency for the peering hop for E2C paths originated from the CPs’ instances
in CA towards our enterprise server in AZ. While the routing policies of GCP
and Azure for E2C paths are similar to our observations for C2C paths, Amazon
seems to hand-oﬀ traﬃc near the destination which is unlike their hot-potato
tendencies for C2C paths. We hypothesize that this change in AWS’ policy is to
minimize the operational costs via their Transit Gateway service which provide
ﬁner control to customers and peering networks over the egress/ingress point of
traﬃc to their network [6]. In addition, observing an equal or lower minimum
latency for TPP routes as compared to BEP routes suggests that TPP routes
are shorter than BEP paths7. We also ﬁnd (not shown here) that the average
7 In the absence of information regarding the physical ﬁber paths, we rely on latency
as a proxy measure of path length.

loss rate on TPP routes is 6 ∗ 10−4 which is an order of magnitude lower than
the loss rate experienced on BEP routes (1.6 ∗ 10−3).
TPP Oﬀers Consistent Throughput for E2C Paths. Figure 6c depicts
the distribution of throughput for E2C paths between our server in AZ and
CP instances in CA via TPP and BEP routes, respectively. While we observe
very consistent throughput values near the purchased link capacity for TPP
paths, BEP paths exhibit higher variability which is expected given the best
eﬀort nature of public Internet paths. Similar to the latency characteristics, we
attribute the better throughput of TPP routes to the lower loss rates and shorter
ﬁber paths from the enterprise server to the CPs’ instances in CA. Moreover,
compared to the CPs’ connect locations, the third-party providers are often
present in additional, distinct colocation facilities closer to the edge and partially
answers the question we posed earlier in Sect. 4.3.
