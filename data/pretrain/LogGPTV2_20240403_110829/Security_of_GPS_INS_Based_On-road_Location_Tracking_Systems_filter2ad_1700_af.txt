if there exists some potential for spooﬁng in this path, the
escape routes can be known well in advance and appropriate
countermeasures can be taken to prevent it. Recall that the
attack algorithm searches for navigation routes with a high
probability of occurrence in other sections of the road network
(c.f., Section III-C2). The ﬁnal path score was calculated
using Equation (2). For generating secure paths that are
more resilient to spooﬁng, the algorithm simply negates this
path score, i.e., score = − (cid:5)M
i=1 P (ϑ(si), θ(χi)). This has
the effect of assigning the highest score to paths containing
unique road curvature and turn angles with low probability of
occurrence. If we choose the count of output paths NP as 1, in
some instances, a path with unique curvature and turns only in
the beginning or towards the end of the path can get chosen.
This could allow the attacker to achieve higher displacement
than other potential paths, which is undesirable. To mitigate
this, the algorithm sets NP as 100 and chooses the path that
outputs the least number of spoofable paths. In other words,
the application or service provider (e.g., logistics company)
can assign “secure navigation routes” that are hard to fake
because of unique road characteristics. Figure 13b shows the
results of evaluations for all cities using the same parameters as
the original simulations, albeit the scoring method. Comparing
with the original simulations, we see the attacker signiﬁcantly
limited in the amount of alternate routes available to him.
VI. RELATED WORK
In 2001, the Volpe report [49] ﬁrst identiﬁed malicious
interference with the civilian GPS signal as a serious prob-
lem. Following this several researchers have demonstrated the
insecurity of GPS-based navigation by diverting the course of
a yacht [11], forcing drones [12] to land in a hostile area and
taking over navigation systems of transportation trucks [24]
using spoofed GPS signals. In addition to commercial GPS
simulators [50], [51], it is today possible to build low-cost
GPS signal spoofers that generate GPS signals for any chosen
trajectory or navigation route using existing public reposi-
tories [44] and less than $300 [43] of hardware equipment.
Advanced attacks [52], [53] in which the attackers takeover
a target receiver that is already receiving navigation messages
from authentic satellite signals without the receiver noticing
any disruption or loss of navigation data. It was also shown
that a variety of commercial GPS receivers were vulnerable
and in some cases even caused permanent damage to the
receivers. Zeng et al. [54] explored the feasibility of stealthily
spooﬁng GPS-based road navigation systems. The attacker
generates fake GPS signals that closely resembles the shape
of a route shown on the navigation software. The goal of the
attack is to fooling the user to drive a route that looks similar
to the original path. The success of the attack depends on the
user’s ability to match the navigation instructions with their
surroundings (e.g., street names). The attack further exploits
the limited area of focus that ﬁrst-person views of majority of
navigation system provide. The ESCAPE attack proposed in
this paper makes no such assumption and succeeds against an
autonomous system that keeps track of a vehicle’s movement
patterns using both GPS and inertial sensors. In fact, Zeng
et al.’s [54] propose the use of inertial navigation sensors
as a countermeasure against their attack. In general, several
countermeasures were proposed against GPS spooﬁng attacks
that are both cryptographic [16], [17], [18], [19] and non-
cryptographic [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] to detect
or mitigate GPS signal spooﬁng attacks. These techniques
are either unreliable (e.g.,
large number of false alarms),
effective only against naive attackers or required modiﬁcations
to the GPS receiver/infrastructure itself. Alternate localization
technologies using WiFi or cellular networks [27], [28] lack
the accuracy and coverage required for the above mentioned
applications and are vulnerable to jamming attacks [55], [56],
[57], [58], [59]. In the context of on-road navigation and
tracking, using data from inertial sensors [29], [30], [31]
alongside GPS is emerging as a popular choice for applications
where spooﬁng and jamming are a threat. The absence of any
communication between the inertial sensors and the external
world for estimating the location makes it robust to signal
spooﬁng and jamming attacks. Many works [36], [37], [38],
[39], [40], [41], [60] analyze and show that inertial sensors are
promising for detection and mitigation of GPS spooﬁng at-
tacks. Many commercial-off-the-shelf GPS/INS products [32],
[33], [34], [35] are available and used in many civilian and
military applications. Recently, analog attacks have also been
demonstrated on inertial sensors. WALNUT [61] shows how
analog acoustic injection attacks can affect the digital integrity
of a capacitive MEMS accelerometer. Son et al. [62] showed
that acoustic interference on MEMS gyroscopes in drones can
cause them to crash. Shoukry et al. [63] demonstrate how to
deliver fake readings to an anti-lock braking system via the
magnetic wheel speed sensors using electro magnetic inter-
ference in an automotive setting. In this paper, we show that
magnetometers are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference
attacks and an attacker can precisely control its output. Given
the emergence of GPS/INS solutions, we believe our work
emphasizes fundamental security limitations of GPS/INS for
road navigation and tracking applications.
