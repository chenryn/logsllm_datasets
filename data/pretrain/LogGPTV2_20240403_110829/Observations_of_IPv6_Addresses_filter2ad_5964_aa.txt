## Abstract
IPv6 addresses, being longer than their IPv4 counterparts, offer a greater degree of expressiveness. By adhering to established conventions and standards, it is possible to draw meaningful conclusions about the usage patterns of IPv6 on nodes with specific addresses. This paper presents a technique for analyzing IPv6 addresses and applies it to several datasets, including addresses observed at a busy mirror server, an IPv6-enabled top-level domain (TLD) DNS server, and through traceroute across the production IPv6 network. The analysis quantifies differences in these datasets, highlighting that different groups use IPv6 in distinct ways.

## 1. Introduction
IPv6 utilizes an address space that far exceeds the immediate needs of current and future devices. This expansive address space aims to simplify address management, both within subnets and across the Internet, by enabling logical rather than compact address assignments. In contrast, IPv4 address allocation under Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) often blurs the line between network and host addresses, complicating the determination of how addresses are used.

In this paper, we leverage IPv6's enhanced expressiveness to infer details about address usage. Similar to IPv4, we can consult IANA databases to identify the registrar assigned to an address. However, IPv6 also allows us to detect users connecting via mechanisms like 6to4 [5] and Teredo [7]. Additionally, standard procedures for allocating host IDs enable us to identify auto-configured hosts and other addressing schemes.

While a skilled IPv6 network engineer could perform this analysis manually, we automate the process and apply it to large datasets. Our datasets include:
- IPv6 addresses observed at `ftp.heanet.ie`
- Recursive DNS servers querying `ns6.iedr.ie`, an authoritative server for the `.ie` domain
- Addresses responding to traceroute through the IPv6 routing infrastructure

Our goal is to understand the deployment and usage of IPv6 in each context, despite the limited nature of the datasets, which still reveal interesting variations.

This study is not the first to assess the state of the IPv6 Internet, but it uniquely focuses on addresses as the primary source of information. Other studies, such as [3, 11], analyze traffic at public 6to4 relays, while [1] describes a repository of anonymized traffic data. Works like [8] focus on routing tables and address block allocations, and others use active probing to measure IPv6 topology [4] or compare performance with IPv4 [2].

## 2. Address Analysis Technique
### 2.1 Prefix Analysis
The breakdown of IPv6 address space is described by several IANA registries. The overall address space is detailed in the `ipv6-address-space` registry, with smaller chunks further described in other registries. For global addresses, the `ipv6-unicast-address-assignments` registry helps identify the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) to which addresses have been assigned.

This classification is similar to what can be done with IPv4 addresses. However, IPv6 addresses can provide additional insights, such as identifying users of 6to4 (2002::/16), Teredo (2001::/32, formerly 3ffe:831f::/32), and 6bone allocations (3ffe::/16, formerly 5f00::/8).

### 2.2 Host ID Analysis
The host ID in an IPv6 address can reveal how IPv6 is configured on a node. Common mechanisms for assigning host IDs include manual configuration (on routers and some servers) and auto-configuration (based on the MAC address of a device). Auto-configuration can be identified by the presence of `fffe` in the middle 16 bits of the host ID and the 7th bit being set.

ISATAP [12] uses IPv4 as a layer 2 for IPv6 and generates an IPv6 host ID from the underlying IPv4 address. ISATAP addresses typically have the first quad (16 bits) of the host ID as `0000` or `0200` and the second quad as `5efe`.

Privacy addressing, specified in [10], uses a cryptographic hash to generate the host ID and clears the 6th bit. To identify privacy addresses, we check if the address fits other known types. If not, we consider it a candidate privacy address if it meets the following criteria:
- The host ID has the 6th bit clear.
- The host ID has between 27 and 35 set bits.
- The first 32 bits have between 9 and 21 set bits.
- The last 32 bits have between 10 and 22 set bits.
- The host ID does not contain two or more "words" (as shown in Fig. 1).

These criteria cover most privacy addresses while rejecting manually configured patterns. We expect this test to identify about three-quarters of all privacy addresses.

Manually assigned host IDs, which are harder to identify, often end in simple patterns like `::1` or `::53`. We call these "low addresses." Another class of manually assigned addresses includes those with regular patterns or words (Fig. 1).

When identifying a host ID, we use the following order: ISATAP, Teredo, autoconf, low, IPv4-based, wordy, privacy.

## 3. Data Sets
### 3.1 HEAnet Mirror Server
This dataset is based on log files from the Apache server running on `ftp.heanet.ie`, a mirror server located in HEAnet, Ireland’s research and education network. The server began offering IPv6 services publicly around May 2002. It mirrors a large number of projects, including Sourceforge, various Linux distributions, Apache, PuTTY, Mozilla, etc., and is the twentieth most visited site hosted in Ireland, according to Netcraft.

Load on the mirror server can be highly variable due to new software releases or changes in available mirrors. The dataset spans from 7 December 2003 to 3 August 2007, with some gaps due to maintenance and service interruptions.

From the beginning, we have a list of the time and address of each IPv6 request and summary IPv4 statistics. From 1 February 2005 onwards, combined log file entries for both IPv4 and IPv6 accesses are available. Fig. 2(a) shows the number of IPv6 hits on days with more than 1000 requests, along with daily IPv4 statistics where available.

To account for trends in IPv6 usage, we normalize by IPv4 hits. Fig. 2(b) shows a scatter plot of IPv4 vs. IPv6 per-day hits, indicating a correlation between the two, though with some outliers.

Fig. 3 shows the number of distinct IPv6 and IPv4 addresses seen each month, along with the mean number of hits per IP address. The patterns of fluctuations are similar for both, suggesting common causes.

### 3.2 IE IPv6-Enabled Nameserver
The `.ie` top-level domain is served by several IPv6-capable name servers. Log files showing all queries to one of these servers, operated by the IEDR, were available from 22 April 2007 to 20 May 2007. The logs record the date of the DNS requests and the IPv6 address making the request.

### 3.3 Traceroute Data
We consider a dataset of addresses revealed by tracerouting to the `::1` address of each prefix in the global IPv6 routing table, which is still relatively compact with around 1000 prefixes. The aim is to reveal the addressing used for routing between prefixes, focusing on router addresses.

The list of addresses was collected in September 2007, using three different source addresses: one 6to4 address, one in a commercial ISP’s PA space, and one in HEAnet’s PA space. The three different source addresses produced 1558, 1687, and 1698 addresses, respectively.

## 4. Results
### 4.1 HEAnet Mirror Server
Fig. 4(a) shows the proportion of IPv6 addresses in the 6bone, global production, 6to4, and Teredo address ranges from month to month. We see substantial activity in the global and 6to4 address spaces, with the fraction of global production addresses increasing over time. 6bone addresses declined until a sharp drop in May 2006, coinciding with their retirement in June 2006.

Initially, there were few Teredo-based addresses, but since mid-2006, there has been a significant increase, likely due to early Windows Vista deployment. User-Agent information indicates a mix of operating systems, mainly Windows XP, Linux, and FreeBSD.

Fig. 4(b) shows the proportion of global addresses allocated by each RIR. As expected, most accesses come from RIPE (Europe). Accesses from ARIN (North America) and APNIC (Asia/Pacific) show interesting trends, with APNIC activity jumping in March 2004 and ARIN activity gradually increasing before declining.

Fig. 5 shows the evolution of host IDs over time. About 10% of addresses remain unclassified. The dominant technique is auto-configuration based on vendor-assigned MAC addresses, followed by IPv4-based addresses, primarily 6to4 addresses. A significant number of addresses with only the low byte non-zero do not show evidence of any particular technology, possibly indicating a mix of manual configuration and scripting. Wordy addresses are less common but more prevalent than expected at random. About 4% of addresses are identified as privacy addresses, with the actual figure estimated to be around 5.5%.
