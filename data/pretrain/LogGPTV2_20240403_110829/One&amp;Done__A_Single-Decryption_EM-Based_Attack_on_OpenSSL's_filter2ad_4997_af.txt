surrounded by computation that operates on highly pre-
dictable values – this causes any signal variation caused
by the return value of BN is bit set to stand out in a
signal that otherwise exhibits very little variation.
Based on these observations, our mitigation relies on
obtaining all the bits that belong to one window at once,
rather than extracting the bits one at a time. We accom-
plish this by using the bn get bits function (deﬁned in
bn exp.c in OpenSSL’s source code), which uses shifts
and masking to extract and return a BN ULONG-sized
group of bits aligned to the requested bit-position – in
our case, the LSB of the window. The BN ULONG is
typically 32 or 64 bits in size, so there are billions of pos-
sibilities for the value it returns, while the total execution
time of bn get bits is only slightly more than the time
that was needed to append a single bit to the window (call
to BN is bit set shifting the wval, and or-ing to up-
date wval with the new bit). For the attacker, this means
that there are now billions of possibilities for the value to
be extracted from the signal, while the number of signal
samples available for this recovery is similar to what was
originally used for making a binary (single-bit) decision.
Intuitively, the signal still contains the same amount of
information as the signal from which one bit used to be
recovered, but the attacker must now attempt to extract
tens of bits from that signal.
This mitigation results in a slight improvement in ex-
ecution time of the exponentiation and, as shown in Fig-
ure 12, with the mitigation the recovery rate for the ex-
ponent’s bits is no better than randomly guessing each
bit (50% recovery rate). In fact, the recovery rate with
the mitigation is lower than 50% because, as in our
pre-mitigation results,
the bits whose signal snippets
could not be located are counted as incorrectly recov-
ered. However, these bits can be treated as erasures, i.e.

lating the signal from a relatively narrow band (40 MHz)
around the processor’s clock frequency (around 1GHz),
which is within the capabilities of compact sub-$1,000
software-deﬁned radio (SDR) receivers.
Finally, we propose a mitigation where the bits of the
exponent are only obtained from an exponent in integer-
sized groups (tens of bits) rather than obtaining them one
bit at a time. This mitigation is effective because it forces
the attacker to attempt recovery of tens of bits from a sin-
gle brief snippet of signal, rather than having a separate
signal snippet for each individual bit. This mitigation
has been submitted to OpenSSL and was merged into its
master source code branch prior to the publication of this
paper.

for each such bit the attacker knows that the value of the
bit is unknown, as opposed to a bits whose value is incor-
rect but the attacker has no a-priori knowledge of that, so
our recovery rate can be trivially improved by randomly
guessing (with 50% accuracy) the value of each erasure,
rather than having 0% accuracy on them. With this, the
post-mitigation recovery rate indeed becomes centered
around 50%, i.e. equivalent to random guessing for all
of the bits.
This mitigation has been submitted to OpenSSL and
was merged into its master source code branch on May

6 Conclusions
This paper presents the ﬁrst side channel attack approach
that, without relying on the cache organization and/or
timing, retrieves the secret exponent from a single de-
cryption on arbitrary ciphertext in a modern (current ver-
sion of OpenSSL) ﬁxed-window constant-time imple-
mentation of RSA. Speciﬁcally, the attack recovers the
exponent’s bits during modular exponentiation from ana-
log signals that are unintentionally produced by the pro-
cessor as it executes the constant-time code that con-
structs the value of each “window” in the exponent,
rather than the signals that correspond to squaring/multi-
plication operations and/or cache behavior during multi-
plicand table lookup operations. The approach is demon-
strated using electromagnetic (EM) emanations on two
mobile phones and an embedded system, and after only
one decryption in a ﬁxed-window RSA implementation
it recovers enough bits of the secret exponents to enable
very efﬁcient (within seconds) reconstruction of the full
private RSA key.
Since the value of the ciphertext is irrelevant to our at-
tack, the attack succeeds even when the ciphertext is un-
known and/or when message randomization (blinding) is
