 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
possible bug
I have already asked on StackOverflow and it seems as if this behavior would
be quite common but there have been no possible solutions.
**What is the current behavior?**  
I have a large webpack build that almost hangs at 91% on an "additional asset
processing" step.  
To complete processing take about 8 minutes but the step "additional asset
processing" consumes at lwat half of the time.  
Webpack does not give me a lot more information and I would like to better
understand if this is "normal", a bug or what can be done to eventually
optimize my build?
