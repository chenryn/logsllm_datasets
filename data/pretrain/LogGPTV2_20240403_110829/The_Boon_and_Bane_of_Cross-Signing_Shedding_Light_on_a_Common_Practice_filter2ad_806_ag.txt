in 2009. The cross-signs for Affirmtrust Networking were revoked
more than a year later due to a double-use of the serial number [17].
In contrast, the Affirmtrust Commercial cross-sign was revoked
only several months before it’s expiry in 2019. The corresponding
root certificates, however, remain trusted.
B.5.2 Digicert Details. In Section 5.6.2, we outlined that Digicert
inherited most of its cross-signs when acquiring CAs. We provide
the details on these cross-signs in the following.
In the Digicert group, most XS-Certs were created before the cor-
responding CAs were acquired by Digicert. Thus, we predominantly
find cross-signs between certificates of the same subsidiary and
only very few cross-signs across Digicert subsidiaries as we illus-
trate in Figure 5. Most cross-signs originate from times of VeriSign,
Verizon, and QuoVadis with Digicert only adding cross-signs among
its own Digicert roots.
VeriSign cross-signed four of its own roots (VeriSign Class 3 Public
Primary Certification Authority - G3, G4, G5, and VeriSign Universal
Root Certification Authority), but also accounts for the cross-sign of
thawte Primary Root CA. Similarly, GeoTrust Primary Certification
Authority, which started out of Equifax’ security business, was
cross-signed during the VeriSign ownership. Only GeoTrust Global
CA was already cross-signed when still owned by Equifax. After
acquiring VeriSign as part of Symantec in 2017, Digicert only used
its control over VeriSign roots to cross-sign DigiCert Global Root
G2 with VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G5.
Otherwise, it only retained the existing cross-signs. We also find an
external cross-sign that was created by VeriSign, but it did not last
until the owner change to Symantec: When Thawte was owned

by VeriSign, Thawte Server cross-signed Entrust.net Secure Server
Certificate Authority. After expiry of these intermediates in 2003,
Thawte did not renew the cross-sign, however, Entrust obtained a
cross-sign by the Digicert-controlled GTE CyberTrust Global Root
in 2004.
Also most intermediate XS-Certs in the Digicert group were
created by VeriSign or Symantec before Digicert obtained control
over these CAs. Specifically, VeriSign created four intermediate
XS-Certs for Thawte as well as three for itself. After acquiring
VeriSign, Symantec, which did not cross-sign any of its roots, further
created 3 intermediate XS-Certs for its own CA name. Only one
further Symantec intermediate XS-Cert was created by Digicert
after its acquisition. Only two (three) months after the cross-signing
(acquisition), Digicert revoked all certificates of this latter XS-Cert,
but otherwise kept the old intermediate XS-Certs active.
A cross-sign of QuoVadis which already existed when it was
acquired by WiSeKey in 2017 survived as an isolated island within
the Digicert group.
Beyond these scope-wise limited cross-signing, Verizon had nu-
merous internal and external cross-signs which became part of the
Digicert group when it acquired the Verizon and CyberTrust roots
from Verizon. Internally, Verizon established multiple cross-signs
across CyberTrust roots, and a Verizon root cross-sign (cf. Figure 5).
Digicert only used Baltimore CyberTrust Root to cross-sign DigiCert
Global Root CA and DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA. The lat-
ter was additionally cross-signed by GTE CyberTrust Global Root
and DigiCert Transition RSA Root (and Entrust.net Secure Server
Certification Authority; cf. Section 5.6.1). However, more prevalent
are the cross-signs of external organizations. First, Verizon started
cross-signing root certificates of WellsFargo since 2013. Specifically
the Baltimore CyberTrust Root cross-signed WellsFargo’s WellsSe-
cure Public Root Certificate Authority and WellsSecure Public Root
Certification Authority 01 G2 in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The
latter was already cross-signed by Verizon Global Root CA in 2013.
All corresponding intermediates were revoked by the CA’s CRL
and Mozilla’s OneCRL in 2017, when the roots were removed from
almost all root stores (after request by WellsFargo [15]), except for
Apple’s store which still includes WellsSecure Public Root Certificate
Authority. Similarly, the Verizon-controlled GTE CyberTrust Global
Root cross-signed Certipost E-Trust Primary Normalized CA provid-
ing this former only by Microsoft trusted root a broad trust coverage
and creating another cross-sign that survived the acquisition by
Digicert.
Verizon also cross-signed several state-controlled CAs which is
potentially problematic (cf. Section 5.2). In 2010 and 2013, Baltimore
CyberTrust Root cross-signed the Swiss Government root which
increased the formerly limited trust (Apple and Microsoft only).
One of the cross-signs expired in 2014, the other stayed active till
after the Digicert acquisition. In 2013, Belgium Root CA2 replaced
a cross-sign by (non-Digicert) GlobalSign Root from 2007 with a
further Verizon cross-sign by CyberTrust Global Root. This cross-
sign also stayed active after the Digicert acquisition until October
2017 when it was revoked in OneCRL [19]. Verizon also used GTE
CyberTrust Global Root and Baltimore CyberTrust Root to cross-
sign Portugal’s SCEE ECRaizEstado (formerly trusted by Microsoft
only). This time, Digicert actively repeated the latter cross-sign
shortly after obtaining control over the CyberTrust roots. However,
when the cross-sign by GTE CyberTrust Global Root expired in
August 2018, the other cross-signs were revoked due to a series of
misissuances [21]. Overall, several independent CAs thus provided
state-controlled CAs with large trust coverage, larger than provided
by the original root certificates.
Finally, we find only a single cross-sign between Digicert’s very
own roots, i.e., DigiCert Global Root CA cross-signed DigiCert Trusted
Root G4.
B.6 Entrust: Further Examples
Beyond Entrusts involvement in Digicert cross-signs (cf. Section
B.5.2), Entrust.net Secure Server CA also cross-signed Trustwave’s
Secure Trust CA and the TDC Internet Root of the danish ISP TDC
in 2006.
Furthermore, Entrust Root Certification Authority and Entrust
Root Certification Authority - G2 created the intermediate XS-Cert
Entrust Certification Authority - L1M in 2014. The G2 root revoked
the cross-sign after a month, but replaced it with a new cross-sign.
Also the intermediate XS-Cert Entrust Certification Authority
- L1B was cross-signed by Entrust.net Secure Server Certification
Authority. When the cross-sign expired, the originally issuing En-
trust.net Certification Authority (2048) revoked the original certifi-
cate declaring it superseded.
Moreover, Entrust cross-signed its Entrust.net Secure Server Cer-
tification Authority and Entrust Certification Authority - L1K. These
cross-signs only yield alternative paths.
B.7 Cross-Signing in the Grid PKI
In the grid-PKI, we do not find a real XS-Cert, but an interesting re-
issuance. Originally, ESnet Root CA 1 issued an intermediate named
NERSC Online CA. A month before its expiry, NERSC created a
corresponding root certificate instead of requesting a new interme-
diate. One could argue that ESnet helped NERSC to bootstrap the
trust in its later root.
B.8 Miscellaneous XS-Certs
Finally, we list less prominent cross-signs.
B.8.1 Miscellaneous Internal Root XS-Certs. We find some more
cross-signs of root certificates issued within a CA. Slovenia used
it’s SI-TRUST Root to cross-sign its sigov-ca and sigend-ca. However,
the corresponding root certificates are included only in Microsoft’s
root store.
Several CAs furthermore used an older certificate to sign new
versions: GlobalSign used its older GlobalSign Root CA to cross-sign
the new GlobalSign Root CA - R2 as well as GlobalSign Root CA -
R3. Similarly, Sonera Class2 CA cross-signed TeliaSonera Root CA
v1 and Chunghwa Telecom’s ePKI Root Certification Authority - G2
cross-signed the ePKI Root Certification Authority. Notably ePKI
Root Certification Authority - G2 is itself cross-signed and the root is
only included in recent Microsoft stores whereas the cross-signed
version is widely trusted. Also SECOM’s Security Communication
EV RootCA1 and Security Communication RootCA2 were both cross-
signed by Security Communication RootCA1. Furthermore, Certum
CA cross-signed the newer Certum Trusted Network CA, and the
DST Root CA X3, which also cross-signed the ISRG Roots used
by Let’s Encrypt, cross-signed IdenTrust Commercial Root CA 1.
The Boon and Bane of Cross-Signing: Shedding Light on a Common Practice in Public Key Infrastructures
CCS ’20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
Likewise, Taiwan CA cross-signed its TWCA Global Root CA with
the TWCA Root Certification Authority and the Hellenic Academic
and Research Institutions RootCA 2015 got cross-signed by Hellenic
Academic and Research Institutions RootCA 2011. Also the Deutsche
Telekom used its established Deutsche Telekom Root CA 2 to cross-
sign the T-TeleSec GlobalRoot Class 2 and T-TeleSec GlobalRoot Class
3 roots. Finally, the TC TrustCenter Class 2 CA, which only got into
Mozilla and Android root stores for a short time, was cross-signed
by TC TrustCenter Class 2 CA II which reached a better root store
coverage, although the trust does not hold up anymore. The exactly
same applies for TC TrustCenter Class 3 CA and it’s cross-signing
of TC TrustCenter Class 3 CA II.
B.8.2 Miscellaneous Internal Intermediate XS-Certs. Keynectis used
its Certplus (Class 2 Primary CA) to issue the intermediate KEYNEC-
TIS ICS ADVANCED Class 3 CA and cross-signed it with OpenTrust
CA for AATL G1, likewise owned by a Keynectics subsidiary.
Chunghwa Telecom created the intermediate XS-Cert Public
Certification Authority - G2 using its roots ePKI Root Certification
Authority and ePKI Root Certification Authority - G2.
Dhimyotis created the intermediate XS-Certs Certigna Services
CA and Certigna Wild CA which provide trust paths to its Certigna
root as well as the Certigna Root CA which is only in the root stores
of Mozilla and Microsoft yet.
B.8.3 Miscellaneous External Intermediate XS-Certs. Other less
prominent intermediate XS-Certs contain cross-signs issued across
CAs. The Vodafone root issued the Vodafone (Secure Sites) interme-
diate in 2006. GTE CyberTrust Global Root cross-signed this interme-
diate for 2008 to 2015, providing trust paths after the expiry of the
Vodafone root in 2011. Another cross-sign by Baltimore CyberTrust
Root extended this trust to 2017, when it was revoked, or even until
its expiry in December 2019 for clients that miss checking the CRL.
The USERTrust Legacy Secure Server CA was signed by Entrust.net
Certification Authority (2048) and Entrust.net Secure Server Certifica-
tion Authority in 2009. 14 months before expiry of those intermedi-
ates, AddTrust External CA Root issued a replacement. Similarly, the
AAA Certificate Services was signed by Entrust.net Secure Server Cer-
tification Authority in 2006 and cross-signed by AddTrust External
CA Root in 2008.
When GTE CyberTrust Global Root was owned by Verizon in
2007-09, it issued the intermediates Vodafone (Corporate Domain
2009), Vodafone (Secure Networks), MULTICERT - Entidade de Certi-
ficado 001, MULTICERT-CA 02, LuxTrust root CA, and Munich Re’s
MRG Intermediate CA 01. In 2012 and 2013, it cross-signed these
intermediates with Baltimore CyberTrust Root which offered a va-
lidity up to 2025 instead of only 2018 as the older root. Several of
the intermediates were revoked later on: Both Vodafone certs were
revoked in March 2017. OneCRL only listed the newer cross-signs
as the older certificates were already distrusted by removal of the
Baltimore CyberTrust Root from Mozilla’s root store in 2015. This
was already applied similarly for the Munich Re intermediate XS-
Cert MRG Intermediate CA 01, which was revoked in 2014, when
OneCRL did not exist yet. OneCRL included the recent cross-sign
in October 2016, when the issuer of the older intermediate was
already excluded from Mozilla’s root store. Similarly, the revoca-
tion of MULTICERT - Entidade de Certificado 001 in 2019 and the
revocation of the LuxTrust root CA in 2017 did not affect the older
certificate as it already expired.
In 2015, Entrust issued and cross-signed the intermediate UIS-
IntB using three different CA certificates, each widely trusted.
Finally, we found re-issuances performed by the same CA but
a different CA certificate which thus do not fall in our definition
of cross-signs: In 2016, SHA-1 Federal Root CA G2 reissued the
intermediate CertiPath Bridge CA whose earlier version, issued by
SHA-1 Federal Root CA, expired in 2014, thus not rendering this case
a cross-sign. A similar case holds for SAS Public CA v1 which was
issued by RSA Public Root CA v1 in 2007 and reissued two weeks
after expiration using RSA Security 2048 V3.
