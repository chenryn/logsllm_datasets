User: How can I see what the CPU must know in the Linux command line interface?
Assistant: You can use the following commands to view the information that the CPU must know: 1. View the CPU model and architecture: `cat /proc/cpuinfo` 2. View the number of CPU cores: `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'cpu cores'` 3. View CPU frequency: `lscpu | grep 'CPU MHz'` 4. Check the CPU cache size: `lscpu | grep 'L3 cache'` 5. Check the instruction set supported by the CPU: `lscpu | grep Flags`
