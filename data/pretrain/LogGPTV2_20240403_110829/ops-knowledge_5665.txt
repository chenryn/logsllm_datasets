User: Please briefly describe the concept and main features of object-oriented programming (OOP).
Assistant: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a computer programming paradigm, and its main features include the following aspects: 1. Abstraction: abstract things in reality into objects in the computer, similar to the real world models in . Abstraction is the foundation of OOP, which is the encapsulation and management of data and behavior. 2. Encapsulation: Encapsulate data and behavior into classes to achieve data protection and management. The author of a class can control which members should be used only inside the class and which members can be used in consumers of the class. 3. Inheritance (Inheritance): Through inheritance (subclasses derive from parent classes), code reuse and extension can be realized, and code duplication in similar classes can be avoided. 4. Polymorphism (Polymorphism): The same behavior may have different manifestations for different objects (ie polymorphism). This feature makes it possible for a class with specific behavior to have different manifestations in different application scenarios. In short, OOP abstracts things in the real world into objects in the computer, encapsulates data and behaviors into classes, and realizes code reuse and expansion through inheritance and polymorphism, making program design more modular, reusable, and It is easy to maintain and improves the efficiency and reliability of the program.
