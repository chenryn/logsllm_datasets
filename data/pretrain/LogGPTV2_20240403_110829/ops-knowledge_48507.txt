User: I want to log analytics data (when someone loads page X, loads a js plugin, cancels a transaction) for my AppEngine app.
I'm going to set it up as follows:
1. Event X occurs.
2. Add to taskqueue to put this event in the datastore.
3. Filter over datastore to graph and analyze usage data.  
So here's the issue: I'd like create a single Analytics Model and store each event as a timestamp on a corresponding list for that action. I'm going to shard this single Model into several instances in the datastore and write to each one randomly and then combine the results for graphing.
BUT, GAE can't filter on lists, so I can't do things like filter for all events TODAY (which is what I'd really like to do).
Any help or advice is appreciated.
Assistant: There's no reason to shard a model. There's no limit on the number of entities you can have with a given kind name - they're all stored in the same Bigtable anyway!
It's not clear what you're trying to do that requires filtering on a list. Can you clarify? What sort of query do you want to perform?
