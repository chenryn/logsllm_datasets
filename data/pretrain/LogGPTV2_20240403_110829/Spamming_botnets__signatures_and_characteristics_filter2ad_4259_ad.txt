### Verification of Spam Campaign Grouping

In this section, we verify the accuracy of the grouping of spam campaigns by analyzing the similarity of their destination web pages. Our verification process specifically targets polymorphic URLs generated from the November 2006 dataset. We crawled all corresponding web pages and applied text shingling [9] to generate 20 hash values (shingles) for each web page. It is important to note that the shingling process removes common HTML headers and tags.

**Figure 11(a)** illustrates the average (f_avg) and maximum (f_max) number of web pages covered by the most common shingle in each campaign. For most spam campaigns, 90% of the destination web pages had an f_avg value greater than 0.75, indicating that these pages are at least 75% similar. The differences in content can be attributed to random advertisements and customized user content. The f_max value was consistently 1, meaning there is at least one identical hash value present.

Next, we analyze whether the destination web pages advertised by different campaigns are dissimilar. If they are, we expect the common shingle (i.e., f_avg) to occur infrequently in web pages associated with other campaigns. To validate this, we measure the ratio of the hash value occurrence within a campaign to its occurrence across all campaigns (see **Figure 11(b)**). For most hash values, the ratio was exactly 1, indicating that they occurred exclusively within one campaign. This validation confirms that the web pages pointed to by each set of polymorphic URLs are similar to each other, while those from different campaigns are distinct.

### Understanding Spammer Botnet Characteristics

In this section, we delve into the characteristics of botnets associated with the identified spam campaigns. We begin by examining their geographic distribution on the Internet and their overall sending patterns. We then study the individual behavior of each spam campaign and analyze the similarities and overlaps in behavior across different campaigns. Given the hypothesis that botnet hosts are often used to actively scan and infect other hosts, we correlate botnet spamming activities with network scanning activities using distributed telescope data [7].

#### 7.1 All Botnet Hosts: A General Perspective

We start our analysis by examining the distribution of botnet hosts across the Internet and their spamming patterns, treating them as a single population.

##### 7.1.1 Distribution of Botnet IP Addresses

**Figure 12(a)** ranks the top five ASes (Autonomous Systems) based on the number of unique botnet IP addresses. Notably, all five ASes are Internet service providers offering residential network access. Although countries like China and Korea are often considered to have a large number of vulnerable home computers, a significant fraction of botnet IPs were found in the U.S., suggesting that the botnet menace is a global phenomenon.

**Figure 12(b)** presents a scatter plot of the number of ASes versus the number of IPs for each spam campaign. We observe that botnet IP addresses are typically spread across a large number of ASes, with each AS having only a few participating hosts on average. The largest spam campaign identified spanned 362 ASes, highlighting the importance of a network-wide view for botnet detection and defense.

Previous research [24] has shown that email servers set up on dynamic IP ranges are more likely to be zombie spam servers. Motivated by this, we compared the list of botnet IPs identified by AutoRE to the list of dynamic IP addresses from [24] and the list of Dynablock IP addresses [8]. On average, 69% of botnet IP addresses were dynamic, confirming that dynamic IP-based hosts are popular targets for infection by botnets. **Figure 12(c)** shows the CDF of the percentage of dynamic IP addresses per campaign. Across all three months, more than 80% of campaigns had at least half of their hosts in dynamic IP ranges. Surprisingly, the spam emails from botnets are shifting away from dynamic IP ranges to static IP addresses. Specifically, the percentage of spam campaigns with at least 80% dynamic IP addresses dropped significantly from 52% in November 2006 to 14% in June 2007. The number of static IP-based botnet hosts increased from 21,010 in November 2006 to 44,790 in July 2007. This shift could be due to the increased adoption of dynamic IP-based blacklists (e.g., Spamhaus [22]). Spammers may query these blacklists before using an IP address, leading them to use static IP addresses not listed on the blacklists. This trend also indicates a potential opportunity to capture and track these bots, as their IP addresses remain static.

##### 7.1.2 Spam Sending Patterns

In this section, we explore the potential for detecting botnet hosts using content-independent features. We are particularly interested in whether botnet hosts exhibit distinct email sending patterns when analyzed individually. From the perspective of a server receiving incoming emails, we selected the following three features (collected at the SMTP protocol level) to describe the sending patterns of each incoming server:

- **Number of recipients per email**: For modeling purposes, we use the reciprocal of this feature, which ranges between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that an email is sent to only one recipient, while a value close to 0 means the email has a large number of recipients.
- **Connections per second**: The frequency of incoming connections received from the host (log scale).
- **Nonexistent recipient frequency**: The rate of observing invalid recipients, normalized by the number of valid emails received from the host.

These features reflect the aggressiveness of spammers and provide a measure of the amount of traffic destined for invalid email addresses, indicating whether spammers are scanning the email address space to obtain valid email addresses. We map each of these features to a coordinate system and represent each record as a point in a three-dimensional space. Our findings show that both the sending patterns of identified botnet hosts and other hosts are well spread in the space. In other words, when viewed individually, botnet hosts do not exhibit distinct sending patterns that would allow for easy identification.

#### 7.2 Per Campaign: An Individual Perspective

In this section, we study individual botnet-based spam campaigns identified by AutoRE and examine whether botnet hosts within a single campaign exhibit varied behavior.

##### 7.2.1 Similarity of Email Properties

As a first step, we analyze the content similarity of botnet emails. For each email that matches a given signature, we shingle its contents. **Figure 13(a)** shows the percentage of emails that share the same shingle. This analysis helps us understand the degree of similarity in the content of emails within a campaign.
