User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题AWS VPN Client connection to new VPC Endpoint is failing I have set up a new VPN following the guide here. However when I try to connect to the VPN with the client i get an error "Connection failed. Try again." This happens every time. I opened the log file from my AppData\Roaming\AWSVPNClient\logs folder and I spotted an error in the log. I have pasted the log below:

I have Googled the exception but not found anything of use. I wonder if it could be that I set up the CIDR ranges incorrectly? That was the only part of the guide that confused me.

Any help is massively appreciated.

Assistant: I had the same problem, which I solved by reinstalling the AWS Client VPN software.
I checked the device driver and there was no TAP-Windows.

  VPN connection process quits unexpectedly
  
  Problem
  
  While connecting to a Client VPN endpoint, the client quits unexpectedly.
  
  Cause
  
  TAP-Windows is not installed on your computer. This software is required to run the client.
  
  Solution
  
  Rerun the AWS-provided client installer to install all the required dependencies.
