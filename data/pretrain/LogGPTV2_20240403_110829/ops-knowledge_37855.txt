Install Puppet or Chef: First, you need to install the client of Puppet or Chef on the server. 2. Configure the Puppet or Chef server: If you need to use the Puppet or Chef server to manage the configuration, you need to configure the Puppet or Chef server and connect it to the server. 3. Create a module: Use Puppet or Chef to create a module to describe the server to configure. These modules include instructions on how to install and configure packages and how to do file setup. 4. Deploy the module: Deploy the module to the server and run Puppet or Chef to enable configuration. 5. Test the configuration: Test to make sure the configuration works correctly. 6. Deploy changes: If changes need to be made to the configuration, the module can be updated and deployed to the server. Overall, using Puppet or Chef to provision servers increases efficiency, reduces errors during manual configuration, and simplifies configuration management.
