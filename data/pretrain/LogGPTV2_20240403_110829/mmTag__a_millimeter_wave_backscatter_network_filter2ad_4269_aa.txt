ABSTRACT
Recent advances in IoT, machine learning and cloud computing
have placed a huge strain on wireless networks. In particular, many
emerging applications require streaming rich content (such as
videos) in real time, while they are constrained by energy sources. A
wireless network which supports high data-rate while consuming
low-power would be very attractive for these applications. Unfortu-
nately, existing wireless networks do not satisfy this requirement.
For example, WiFi backscatter and Bluetooth networks have very
low power consumption, but their data-rate is very limited (less than
a Mbps). On the other hand, modern WiFi and mmWave networks
support high throughput, but have a high power consumption
(more than a watt).
To address this problem, we present mmTag, a novel mmWave
backscatter network which enables low-power high-throughput
wireless links for emerging applications. mmTag is a backscatter
system which operates in the mmWave frequency bands. mmTag
addresses the key challenges that prevent existing backscatter net-
works from operating at mmWave bands. We implemented mmTag
and evaluated its performance empirically. Our results show that
mmTag is capable of achieving 1 Gbps and 100 Mbps at 4.6 m and 8
m, respectively, while consuming only 2.4 nJ/bit.

based video streaming for sporting events and disaster scenarios [33,
37, 38, 45, 52]. While these prospects sound exciting, the reality
is that most of these applications require high data-rate wireless
connectivity while having limited energy sources. Unfortunately,
existing wireless networks can not support high data-rate while
consuming low energy.
Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology promises to revolution-
ize wireless networks [32]. In fact, this technology has been de-
clared as a central component in 5G and 6G cellular networks.
mmWave wireless networks have two main advantages over tradi-
tional wireless networks. First, they provide much higher data-rates
by operating in high-frequency spectrum (24GHz and above). Sec-
ond, they can provide connectivity to many nodes simultaneously
by performing space division multiplexing. Unfortunately, despite
these advantages, existing mmWave networks have high power
consumption which makes them unsuitable for applications with
limited energy sources. For example, recent mmWave platforms
developed by research communities such as OpenMilli, MiRa and
the NI platform consume about 10-20 watts [2, 4, 47]. Commer-
cial mmWave chipsets, such as the Qualcomm QCA9500, consume
several watts [36]. The high power consumption of mmWave net-
works is due to the high power consumption of Radio Frequency
(RF) circuits operating at mmWave frequencies. Unfortunately, this
is a fundamental problem since the power consumption of RF cir-
cuits is proportional to their operating frequencies. Additionally, in
contrast to traditional radios, mmWave radios require steerable di-
rectional antennas (i.e. phased arrays), which significantly increase
the power consumption of these radios.
In this paper, we introduce mmTag, an ultra-low power mmWave
network. mmTag’s nodes consume only a few milliwatts, and hence
they can be powered by a small battery or solar panel. mmTag
enables the creation of low-power mmWave network by combin-
ing mmWave and Backscatter technologies. In particular, mmTag
is a backscatter system which operates at mmWave frequencies.
backscatter technology offers very low-power wireless commu-
nication by enabling nodes to piggyback their data on the radio
frequency (RF) signals of other devices, instead of generating and
transmitting their own signals. Eliminating the need for an ac-
tive transmitter and power-hungry RF components has enabled
backscatter devices to communicate on a very low energy bud-
get. However, to build a backscatter system which operates in the
mmWave frequency bands, mmTag must overcome multiple chal-
lenges.
a) Beam Alignment Challenge: Due to the high frequency
nature of mmWave, these signals experience greater path loss than
low frequency signals. Therefore, mmWave radios have to use
directional antennas to focus their transmitted and received power
into narrow beams to compensate for that loss. Communication
between two mmWave nodes is only possible when their beams are

well-aligned as shown in Figure 1. Moreover, when a node moves,
it needs to search again for the best beam direction. Although past
mmWave work has proposed different approaches and schemes
for creating a directional beam and searching for the best beam
direction [10, 16, 20, 30], they are not practical for backscatter
devices for two reasons. First, in order to steer a beam, most existing
schemes require phased array antennas. Unfortunately, phased
arrays are costly and consume a significant amount of power which
makes them impractical for backscatter devices [4, 26]. Second,
and most importantly, all existing schemes require both nodes to
transmit and/or measure the received signals. Backscatter devices
can only reflect signals and can neither transmit nor measure the
received signals. Therefore, to build a mmWave backscatter device,
we need to design a beam searching scheme which does not require
the device to have any transmitter or receiver. Moreover, we need
to avoid using power-hungry mmWave hardware in our design,
such as phased array antennas.
b) Self-Interference Challenge: Another challenge in design-
ing a mmWave backscatter network is the self-interference problem.
In particular, an Access Point (AP) device which communicates to
backscatter nodes is required to transmit a query signal and listen
to the node’s response at the same time. This is a challenging task
since the node’s response is a modulated version of the transmitted
signal, and hence it requires the AP to have a full-duplex radio
to decode the backscatter signal. Unfortunately, full-duplex radios
operating at mmWave frequencies, require complex analog and dig-
ital hardware and are not commercially available [40]. Therefore,
we must develop a system which enables the AP to transmit and
receive signals at the same time without complex and expensive
hardware.
c) Mobility Challenge: The third challenge in building a mm-
Wave backscatter network is dealing with mobility. In particular,
communication must be possible regardless of the angle and orien-
tation of the backscatter node. This is challenging since mmWave
networks use directional antennas, as opposed to traditional wire-
less networks which use omni-directional antennas.
mmTag addresses these challenges. In particular, mmTag over-
comes the beam alignment problem by building on the Van Atta
technique [39], developing a directional backscatter node which
modulates and reflects the received signal back in the direction of
arrival, regardless of the incidence angle. This enables the node to
have its beam always aligned toward the AP, even if they move.
mmTag achieves this without using any costly or power hungry
mmWave components such as amplifiers or phase shifters. Fur-
thermore, mmTag uses the polarization property of antennas and
introduces a novel feed network which solves the interference and
mobility challenges. In particular, mmTag’s nodes are able to change
the polarization of the signal by 90◦ during reflection. This allows
the AP to use antennas with orthogonal polarization for transmit-
ter and receiver beams, and hence can easily separate the received
signal from the transmitted signal regardless of the orientation of
the nodes.
This paper makes the following contributions:
• We introduce mmTag, a mmWave backscatter network which
enables high data-rate wireless links while consuming ultra-
low power.
Figure 1: mmWave devices need to focus their energy into
beams, and align them to establish a communication link.
• We design a novel backscatter node which modulates, changes
polarization and reflects the received signal back in the direc-
tion of arrival, regardless of the incidence angle and without
using any costly or power-hungry components.
• We built a prototype of mmTag and evaluated its perfor-
mance empirically. Our results show that mmTag can achieve
robust communication links with data-rates of 1 Gbps, 100
Mbps and 15 Mbps at a range of 4.6 m, 8 m, and 14 m, respec-
tively .
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 mmWave Communication
mmWave refers to high frequency RF signals in the range of 24
GHz to 100 GHz. At this frequency range, there is multi-GHz of
unlicensed bandwidth available, 200x more than the bandwidth allo-
cated to traditional wireless networks. The availability of this large
bandwidth promises to enable wireless networks with orders of
magnitude higher throughput than today’s wireless networks [27].
Past work on mmWave communication mostly focuses on applica-
tions that require very high data-rate links, while using substantial
energy and computing power. For example, [8] presented a sys-
tem that enables high throughput links between server racks by
using mmWave technology in data centers. There is also a signif-
icant amount of work on 5G networks which relies on mmWave
technology [11, 32, 34]. mmWave technology has also been used
for Virtual Reality to stream high data-rate video from PC to the
VR headset [3, 9]. In contrast, this paper focuses on designing a
mmWave backscatter network which enables low-power mmWave
communication.
A major challenge in designing a mmWave network is that
mmWave signals decay very quickly with distance, requiring mm-
Wave radios to focus their power into very narrow beams in order
to compensate for propagation losses [31]. These beams are typ-
ically created by using an array of antennas [24]. Luckily, since
the antenna size is proportional to the wavelength, one can pack
many mmWave antennas into a small area, creating a narrow beam.
Although mmWave radios can compensate for the propagation loss
using directional beams, a new challenge arises since communica-
tion is only possible when the transmitter’s and receiver’s beams
are aligned [16]. Hence, mmWave devices need to continuously
search the space for the best beam direction before establishing a
communication link.
There is a vast literature on the area of mmwave beam align-
ment [3, 12, 16, 22, 35, 42, 46]. Most propose different techniques
to speed up the beam searching process, enabling mmWave link

for mobile applications. However, these techniques require phased
arrays to steer the beam electronically and search for the best beam
alignment. Unfortunately, phased arrays are expensive to build and
have high power consumption [4, 25, 26, 47]. Recent work has pro-
posed a beam searching process without the use of phased array by
exploiting channel blockage [26]. However, previous works require
the node to have an active radio to transmit a signal or measure the
received signal. Unfortunately, active radios significantly increase
the power consumption of a wireless node, and are therefore not
suitable for a backscatter design. In contrast, mmTag performs beam
alignment using only passive components (i.e. without requiring
any phased array, transmitter or receiver).
Finally, there is some preliminary work on designing a backscat-
ter mmWave tag [17, 21]. However, this work focuses on sensing
environment (such as humidity) rather than enabling high-data-
rate, low-power communication links. Moreover, it does not support
mobility truly since it does not work for all orientations of a tag.
Concurrently to our work, the authors of [23, 41] proposed using
mmWave backscatter for localization and intelligent transporta-
tion systems. However, their designs do not address modulation
and self-interference problem, and hence can not be used for com-
munication purposes. In contrast, mmTag focuses on designing a
mmWave backscatter network which supports mobility and enables
a low-power, high-data-rate communication link regardless of the
location, angle and orientation of the node.
2.2 Backscatter Communication
Backscatter technology is the most energy-efficient wireless com-
munication link [6, 18, 48, 50, 51]. A typical backscatter system
consists of two parts: an AP and one or multiple backscatter nodes.
The node communicates to the AP by backscattering instead of
generating and transmitting its own signal. In particular, the AP
transmits an RF signal to the node. The node replies to the AP by
reflecting the signal using a simple modulation scheme. For exam-
ple, in RFID the tag uses On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation where
reflecting the reader’s signal represents a ‘1’ bit, and absorbing the
signal represents a ‘0’ bit. Due to its low-power consumption, this
communication technology is well-suited for applications where
battery replacement is challenging, or the battery life is expected
to be long.
In recent years, RFID sensing systems have been designed in
the research community to target a variety of applications ranging
from food monitoring and smart homes to touch sensing and local-
ization [14, 28, 29, 44]. There is also a significant amount of work fo-
cused on designing wireless networks for RFID tags [43]. However,
existing RFID tags enable throughput of less than a Mbps. Recent
work has proposed designing WiFi-based backscatter tags [5, 19, 51].
Their goal is to design backscatter nodes which communicate with
WiFi devices to enable much higher throughput than traditional
RFID tags, however their throughput is still very limited. For ex-
ample, HichHike can only support 0.3 Mbps in the best case [48].
BackFi tries to solve the throughput problem of WiFi backscatter
systems by using customized full-duplex radios. However, it can
only support up to 5 Mbps at a short range of less than 1 meter
