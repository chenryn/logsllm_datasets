### Industry Progression
*Smoking Cloud may be hazardous to your health.*

---

### Realization
- I no longer understand what my system is doing.
- I don't know what "normal" looks like.
- A 2-minute pcap file is larger than a 2-minute MP3.
- My `netstat` output is overwhelming.

### The Activity Light is Solid

### Third Party Analysis
*Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.*

### Wait, Monitoring?
**#1:** You mean like IDS, IPS, NAC, sniffers, scrapers, log monitors, and the theory of Atlantis?  
**#2:** No, I mean, how do I know what my system is doing?  
**#1:** Try Wireshark, noob.  
**#2:** Just because I'm a genetically enhanced 3-month-old doesn't mean you can make this personal. Besides, Wireshark is for analysis, not monitoring.  
**#3:** Can you guys keep it down? This 2-person escape pod is bad enough without your 21st-century IT debates.

### Something... Else
- Like in the old days, when activity lights on modems provided simple feedback.
- An excuse to use Arduino and sound good on a Defcon schedule.
- Includes blinky lights.
- Provides visibility into network activity.

---

### Visibility vs. Visualization
- **Visibility:** More tactical and real-time, akin to the military term for the ability to "see" what's there and make decisions.
- **Visualization:** Tends to be complex and static, requiring focused attention.
- **Visibility** taps into our cognition, while **visualization** taps into our reasoning abilities.

### Real-time Cognition
- Examples: Driving, video games, sports.
- Direct connection between the senses and acute perception of slight variances in stimuli.
- Scholarly Reference: "Real-time cognition is best described as a continuously changing pattern of neuronal activity." — Michael J. Spivey and Rick Dale, Cornell University and University of Memphis.

### Let's Play with Electronics

### Peripherals
- Screen real estate is limited.
- Widget displays like Dashboard are on-demand only.
- USB trinkets and toys are gaining popularity, e.g., Nerf shooters, ninja detectors, LED Christmas trees.

---

### Crazy Idea
- Render network data onto an LED matrix in real-time.
- Use color, motion, and other effects to show network activity.
- Tap into natural pattern-matching abilities to detect variances.

---

### cerealbox
- Named for our tendency to read and interpret anything in front of us.
- A "background" technology that we see peripherally.
- Detects patterns to show variances without deep analysis.
- Provides just enough information to know when to investigate further.

---

### Arduino Uno
- Based on the Atmel ATMega328.
- Specifications: 8-bit RISC CPU @ 16MHz, 32k flash, 2k SRAM.
- USB-powered with USB-to-serial communication.
- Good reference manual and easy-to-use IDE.
- Price: ~$30.

---

### Colors Shield
- Arduino shield for manipulating multicolor LEDs.
- iTead Studio: ~$15.
- 8x8 multicolor LED Matrix: ~$21.
- Total cost: ~$66.

---

### Design Goals
- Simplicity.
- Data sent over serial from the host system.
- Minimal data retention and processing.
- Easy to understand and extend.

---

### Data Points
- MAC address (L2 data for MITM detection).
- IP address.
- TCP/UDP port (breakdown by service).
- Country Code (using GeoIP).

---

### Language
- Example: `1,00254B000102,0A000001,0050,US`
  - Command: 1 (open), 2 (close)
  - MAC Address
  - IP Address (hex)
  - Port number (hex)
  - Country Code

---

### Arduino Code
- Session tracker code available on the Defcon CD.
- Basic C programming with arrays and for loops.
- Limited but "good enough."
- Text processing example provided.

---

### Converting Country Code to RGB
- Procedurally created colors.
- ASCII value of the last country code letter is the seed for Red.
- First letter -> Green.
- Resulting Green random number is the seed for Blue.

### All the Colors of the Skype Rainbow

---

### Data Storage
- Simplified communication model.
- Store IP and Port in an array.
- 9 bytes per entry (RGB, IP, Port).
- 128 entries ~ 1.2K SRAM.

---

### Array
- Example code for adding to the array.

---

### Meter Mode
- Another view of the dataset.
- Equalizer-like display to show traffic spikes and types.

---

### Performance Considerations
- 9600 bps link, no handshaking.
- Message size: 32 bytes.
- Approximately 37 messages/second, realistically around 32.

---

### Inferno Mode
- Display limited to 128 connections.
- Overload detection and freak-out mode.
- Preferably something psychedelic.

---

### Overload Detection
- Example code for overload detection.

---

### Controller Code
- Perl script using Net::Pcap.
- Simple logic to enumerate sessions and perform GeoIP.
- Pipes data over serial to the Arduino.
- Two messages: Open (1) and Close (2).

---

### Future Ideas
- Ethernet Shield to eliminate USB.
- Better host-side program to show more data.
- Bigger LEDs for better visibility.
