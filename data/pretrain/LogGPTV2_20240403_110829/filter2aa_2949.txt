Realization 
• 
I don’t know what the hell my box is doing anymore 
• 
I don’t know what normal looks like 
• 
2 minute pcap file > 2 minute MP3 
• 
My netstat hurts

Wait, monitoring? 
#1: You mean like IDS, IPS, NAC, sniffers, scrapers, log 
monitors, and the theory of Atlantis? 
#2: No, I mean like wtf is my box doing? 
#1: Yeah try wireshark noob 
#2: Just because I am a genetically enhanced 3-month-old is 
no reason to make this personal. Besides wireshark is for 
analysis, not monitoring. 
#3: Can you guys keep it down? This 2-person escape pod is 
bad enough without your 21st century era IT debate 
reenactments.

Something… else 
• 
Like the old days, the activity lights on modems and stuff 
• 
Something that makes a good excuse for Arduino and 
sounds good on a Defcon schedule 
• 
And has freaking blinkie lights 
• 
Something that provides visibility

Visibility vs. Visualization 
• 
Going for something that’s more “peripheral”, tap into 
human cognition 
• 
Making up my own distinctions here 
• 
Visualization 
•  Tends to be complex, static image that we stare at 
• 
Visibility - more tactical, realtime 
•  i.e. the military term: our ability to “see” what’s there 
(depending on weather conditions, etc) and make decisions 
• 
Visualization taps into our ability to reason 
• 
Visibility taps into our cognition

Real-time Cognition 
• 
I only sort of know what I’m talking about here 
• 
Examples: 
•  Driving 
•  Video Games 
•  Sports 
• 
Direct connection between the senses 
• 
Acute perception of slight variances in stimuli 
• 
Dude I made that up and it sounds awesome

Scholarly Reference 
“Real-time cognition is best described not as a sequence of 
logical operations performed on discrete symbols but as a 
continuously changing pattern of neuronal activity.”

Peripherals 
• 
Screen real estate market is tapped out 
•  The maximize button 
•  Widget displays such as Dashboard are on-demand only 
• 
USB trinkets/toys are on the rise 
•  Nerf shooter 
•  Ninja detectors 
•  LED Christmas trees

Crazy idea 
• 
Render network data onto LED matrix in realtime 
• 
Use color, motion, other effects to show what happening on 
the wire 
• 
Try to get back a “feel” for what our systems are doing 
• 
Tap into our natural pattern-matching ability to detect 
variances

cerealbox 
• 
Name came from our tendency to read/interpret anything in 
front of us 
• 
Kind of a “background” technology, something that we see 
peripherally 
• 
Pattern detection lets us see variances without digging too 
deep 
• 
Just enough info to let us know when it’s time to dig deeper

Colors Shield 
• 
Arduino “shield” that connects to header pins 
• 
Makes it easy to manipulate multicolor LEDs 
directly 
• 
iTead Studio: ~15 
• 
Plus 8x8 multicolor  
LED Matrix: ~21 
• 
Total for all parts, about $66

Design Goals 
• 
Simplicity 
• 
Controller on host system sends data over serial 
• 
cerealbox interprets, renders to screen 
• 
Minimal data retention (2k SRAM!) 
• 
Minimal data processing 
•  Session based vs. packet based 
• 
Easy to understand, extend

Data points 
• 
MAC address 
•  L2 data might let us do something about MITM 
• 
IP address 
• 
TCP/UDP port 
•  Breakdown data by service 
• 
Country Code 
•  Let’s take advantage of GeoIP

Arduino code 
• 
Session tracker code on Defcon CD 
• 
Everything is basic C – limited but “good enough” 
• 
Primary tools are arrays and for loops 
• 
Hashtables – possible with hacks but not native

Converting Country Code to RGB 
• 
Country colors are procedurally created 
•  vs. a table, which would take up SRAM/Flash 
• 
Arduino random is simply a long string of numbers 
•  Can use other sources for true random 
•  But we actually want reproducible pseudo-random numbers 
• 
ASCII value of last Country Code letter is Random Seed for 
Red 
• 
First letter -> Green 
• 
Resulting Green random number is seed for Blue

Data Storage 
• 
Simplified communication model = Arduino data storage 
• 
Close (IP) (Port) – how does it know which LED? 
• 
Store IP and Port in array  
• 
9 bytes per entry 
•  RGB, IP, Port 
• 
128 entries ~ 1.2K 
•  OMG mah SRAM’s

Meter mode 
• 
Another take on the dataset 
• 
Based on types of sessions being made 
• 
Equalizer-ish view 
• 
Give visibility to spikes, type of traffic being sent

Performance considerations 
• 
9600 bps link, no handshaking 
•  Could up the speed, but be careful 
• 
9600 bps ~ 1200 bytes/second 
• 
Message size: 32 bytes 
• 
37 messages / sec, real probably about 32

Inferno mode 
• 
Display limited to 128 connections 
• 
Need to have a freak-out mode 
•  Throw hands up 
•  Let user know that things are getting silly 
• 
Preferably something psychedelic

Controller code 
• 
Perl script using Net::Pcap 
•  It works on Snow Leopard too 
• 
Fairly simple logic to enumerate sessions, do GeoIP 
• 
Pipes over serial to Arduino 
• 
2 messages, Open (1) and Close (2)

Future Ideas 
• 
Ethernet Shield 
•  Eliminate need for USB/program 
•  Would need 2x adapters 
•  Performance would probably 
take a crap 
• 
Better host-side program 
•  Show more data behind each  
light 
• 
Bigger LEDs 
•  You know, for senior citizens
