### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
package-lock.json does not contain an os-independent string for local
dependencies, therefore package-lock.json is always changing when it was
committed from windows and then building on linux.
I think the issue might be that the lock file contains an OS-normalized
string, while it should actually contain some string that is independent of
the OS and only gets translated when the package-lock.json is parsed.
### Expected Behavior
Expected behaviour would be that the same package-lock.json is generated no
matter the OS.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. In Windows 10, node --version v16.13.2, npm --version = 8.5.4
  2. Have a package json dependency like this:
    "dependencies": {
            "some-local-dependency": "file:../myproject/module"
        }
On windows, this produces a package-lock.json on windows that has this
relevant section generated:
    "dependencies": {
            "some-local-dependency": {
                "version": "file:\\myproject\\module"
            }
        }
On linux, the same package json results in the following package-lock.json
(and therefore makes the committed package-lock.json dirty in git):
    "dependencies": {
            "some-local-dependency": {
                "version": "file:../myproject/module"
            }
    }
Both package-lock.json files shoud have the same path separator.
### Environment
