My issue is about a funny behavior of scipy function integrate.quad.
Integrating a gaussian function I get wrong values depending on the
integration interval. See below.  
in [3] I compute the integral on [-100, 0.5] and I get the expected value.
In [4] I compute the same integral on [-1000,0.5]. I expect the same value
because there is no co ntribute to the integral sum extending the interval to
the left. But I get a wrong value.
In [5] and [6] I show that something happens between -997 and -998
In [7] I extend further the integration interval and the returned value is
still wrong (I've tried several values with the same result.
In [8] I show that the integral is correct if I integrate from -infinity
