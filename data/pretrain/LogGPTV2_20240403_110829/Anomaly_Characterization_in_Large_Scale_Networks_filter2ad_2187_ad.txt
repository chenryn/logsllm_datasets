following theorem.
Based on this neighborhood division, we enunciate the
Theorem 6: For any k ≥ 1 and for any j ∈ Ak,
∃B ∈ Wk(j) such that B ⊆ Jk(j) =⇒ j ∈ Mk
Proof: The proof is done by contradiction. Let B be a
set such that B ∈ Wk(j) and B ⊆ Jk(j). Suppose that there
exists an anomaly partition Pk = {B1, . . . , B(cid:2)} such that j ∈
IPk. Two cases must be considered.
1) Let (cid:2) ∈ B be such that |Pk((cid:2))| > τ. By Deﬁnition 6,
Pk((cid:2)) has a τ-dense motion, thus Pk((cid:2)) ∈ Wk((cid:2)). By
Remark 1, let L be a set of W k((cid:2)) such that Pk((cid:2)) ⊆ L.
By assumption of the theorem, B ⊆ Jk(j), and thus, for
any set of W k((cid:2)), j belongs to this set, and in particular
j belongs to L. By assumption of the proof, j ∈ IPk,
therefore j /∈ Pk((cid:2)). Therefore, we have Pk((cid:2))∪{j} ⊆ L
and so Pk((cid:2)) ∪ {j} has an r-consistent motion, and its
size is greater than τ + 1. Hence Pk((cid:2))∪{j} is τ-dense,
which contradicts condition C2 of Deﬁnition 6.
2) Suppose now that for any (cid:2) in B,|Pk((cid:2))| ≤ τ. We
have B ⊆ (cid:2)
|Bi|≤τ Bi. By assumption,
B ∈ Wk(j). Therefore, B is a τ-dense motion, which
contradicts condition C1 of Deﬁnition 6.
(cid:2)∈B Pk((cid:2)) ⊆ (cid:2)
Both contradictions conclude the proof.
We now present a necessary and sufﬁcient condition that ﬁnds
all the devices that belong to Mk. Note that this condition
is more intricate and requires substantially more computation
than the necessary one exhibited in Theorem 6.
C. Necessary and Sufﬁcient Condition to Belong to Mk
We ﬁrst give an intuition of this condition by exhibiting
the type of scenario that Theorem 6 does not cover. Figure 5
shows a system S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} where each device
in S belongs to Ak. Suppose that τ = 3. We focus on device 1.
The same argument holds for the other devices by symmetry of

the system states. We have W k(1) = {{1, 2, 3, 4},{1, 2, 7, 8}}
and Dk(1) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}. By deﬁnition, Jk(1) = {1, 2}
and Lk(1) = {3, 4, 7, 8}. As |Jk(1)|  τ. Indeed, the only two anomaly par-
titions Pk and P(cid:2)
k of Ak for τ = 3 are respectively equal
to {{1, 2, 7, 8},{3, 4, 5, 6}} and {{1, 2, 3, 4},{5, 6, 7, 8}}. In
both cases, we have |Pk(1)| = |P(cid:2)
k(1)| > τ. Thus we have a
conﬁguration where device 1 belongs to Mk while one cannot
build a dense motion with devices in Jk(1). The following
theorem provides a necessary (and sufﬁcient) condition for a
device to belong to Mk.
Theorem 7: For any time k ≥ 1 and for any j ∈ Ak, j ∈
Mk if and only if W k(j) (cid:10)= ∅ and for all collections C of
pairwise disjoint sets deﬁned by C ⊆ {B ∈ Wk((cid:2)) | (cid:2) ∈
Lk(j), j /∈ B} one of the following two relations holds:
∃A ∈ Wk(j) : A ⊆ Dk(j) \ (cid:2)
∃B ∈ C : B ∪ {j} ∈ Wk(j).

Proof: For both senses of the equivalence, their contra-
posive is proven.
• Suppose that j /∈ Mk. This means that there exists at
least one anomaly partition Pk = {B1, . . . , B(cid:2)} such
that |Pk(j)| ≤ τ. Consider the collection C1 deﬁned by
C1 = {B ∈ Pk | |B| > τ}. By deﬁnition of an anomaly
partition, we have ∀B, B(cid:2) ∈ C1, B ∩ B(cid:2) = ∅. Now, by
condition C2 of Deﬁnition 6, ∀B ∈ C1, B ∪ {j} is not a
r-consistent motion. As a consequence, B∪{j} /∈ Wk(j).
Moreover, by deﬁnition of C1, ∀(cid:2) ∈ Dk(j)\(cid:2)
B, we
have |Pk((cid:2))| ≤ τ. Thus, Dk(j)\(cid:2)
B ⊆ (cid:2)
B∈C1
|Bi|≤τ Bi.
By condition C1 of Deﬁnition 6, ∀B ⊆ (cid:2)
B∈C1
|Bi|≤τ Bi, B
is not a τ-dense motion, and thus B /∈ Wk(j). Hence,
we have ∀A ∈ Wk(j), A (cid:2) Dk(j) \ (cid:2)
B, which
concludes the ﬁrst part of the proof.
• We prove the second contraposive.
1) Suppose that Wk(j) = ∅. By Theorem 5, j ∈ Ik and
thus we have j /∈ Mk.
2) Suppose that Wk(j) (cid:10)= ∅ and ∃C1 ⊆ {B ∈ Wk((cid:2)) |
(cid:2) ∈ Lk(j) ∧ j /∈ B} satisfying [B ∩ B(cid:2) = ∅,∀B, B(cid:2) ∈
B∈C1
C1] such that the following two relations hold:
B,
∀A ∈ Wk(j), A (cid:2) Dk(j) \ (cid:2)
B∈C1
∀B ∈ C1, B ∪ {j} /∈ Wk(j).
(6)
(7)
Consider an anomaly partition Pk such that ∀B ∈
C1, B ∈ Pk. By Relation (6), j cannot belong to
a dense motion compounded of points that are not
in an element of C1. Moreover, by relation (7), j
cannot belong to any dense motion of C1. Thus, by
construction of Pk, we have |Pk(j)| ≤ τ and thus
j /∈ Mk, which completes the proof.

(cid:5)
B∈C B
Coming back to the example shown in Figure 5, we
have Lk(1) = {3, 4, 7, 8}, and thus the family of sets
{B ∈ Wk((cid:2))
(cid:2) ∈ Lk(1) ∧ 1 /∈ B} is equal
to
{{3, 4, 5, 6},{5, 6, 7, 8}}. Two cases need to be considered.
1) B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. Then Dk(1) \ (cid:4)(cid:2)
= {1, 2, 7, 8}
which is a τ-dense motion and thus device 1 belongs to
2) B = {5, 6, 7, 8}. Then Dk(1) \ (cid:4)(cid:2)
a massive anomaly in this conﬁguration.
= {1, 2, 3, 4}
B∈C B
which is a τ-dense motion and thus 1 belongs to a
massive anomaly in this conﬁguration.
Therefore, as there are no other conﬁguration satisfying [B ∩
B(cid:2) = ∅,∀B, B(cid:2) ∈ C], all collections have been tested and thus
device 1 ∈ Mk.
D. A Necessary and Sufﬁcient Condition to Belong to Uk
(cid:5)
We end this section, by enunciating a corollary that derives
from both Theorems 6 and 7. This corollary gives a necessary
and sufﬁcient condition for a device to belong to an unresolved
conﬁguration.
Corollary 8: For all times k ≥ 1 and j ∈ Ak, j ∈ Uk if
and only if W k(j) (cid:10)= ∅ and it exists a collection C of pairwise
disjoint sets deﬁned by C ⊆ {B ∈ Wk((cid:2)) | (cid:2) ∈ Lk(j), j /∈ B}
such that the following two conditions hold:
∀A ∈ Wk(j) : A (cid:2) Dk(j) \ (cid:2)
∀B ∈ C : B ∪ {j} (cid:10)∈ Wk(j).
B∈C B, and
(8)
Proof: Straightforward from case 2) of the proof of
Theorem 7.
To summarize, we have derived conditions that allow any
impacted device to decide whether many other devices have
been impacted by the very same error or not. We have shown
that concomitant errors may lead to unresolved conﬁgurations,
that is states in which they cannot tell whether they have been
impacted by a massive error or not. Finally, we have shown
that each device j only needs to know the trajectories that are
at no more than 4r from itself to decide. A larger radius of
knowledge – as the one got by an omniscient observer that
samples at each time k the system state, i.e., Sk – does not
bring any additional information and thus does not provide a
higher error detection accuracy. The following two sections
present respectively the local algorithms run by impacted
devices, and the performance of these algorithms in terms of
accuracy and complexity through extensive simulations.
