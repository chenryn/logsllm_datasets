User: Hey :)  I'm working on a Mac with Mountain Lion, and installed both Ruby 1.9.3 and Python 2.7.3 from homebrew.  However, which python and which ruby return that they are in /usr/local/bin/__, respectively.  I would like them to read from /usr/local/Cellar/python or /usr/local/Cellar/ruby.  How do I change their paths?
Assistant: Seems like you ought to just modify your $PATH to include /usr/local/Cellar before /usr/local/bin. Your shell will use the first one it finds.
