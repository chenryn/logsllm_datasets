**Description:**
The `query user` command displays information about user sessions on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) server. This command can be used to determine if a specific user is logged on to a particular RDSH server. The information returned includes:

- **User Name:** The name of the user.
- **Session Name:** The name of the session on the RDSH server.
- **Session ID:** The unique identifier for the session.
- **Session State:** Whether the session is active or disconnected.
- **Idle Time:** The number of minutes since the last keystroke or mouse movement in the session.
- **Logon Time:** The date and time when the user logged on.

**Note:**

**Syntax:**
```shell
query user [UserName | SessionName | SessionID] [/server:ServerName]
```

**Parameters:**

- **UserName:**
  - Specifies the logon name of the user you want to query.
- **SessionName:**
  - Specifies the name of the session you want to query.
- **SessionID:**
  - Specifies the ID of the session you want to query.
- **/server:ServerName:**
  - Specifies the RDSH server you want to query. If this parameter is not provided, the current RDSH server is queried. This parameter is required if you are running the command from a remote server.
- **/? :**
  - Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Permissions:**
To use this command, you must have Full Control permission or special access permission.

**Remarks:**
- If you do not specify a user using the `UserName`, `SessionName`, or `SessionID` parameters, a list of all users logged on to the server will be returned.
- You can also use the `query session` command to display a list of all sessions on a server.
- When `query user` returns information, a greater than (>) symbol is displayed before the current session.

**Examples:**

- To display information about all users logged on to the system, type:
  ```shell
  query user
  ```

- To display information about the user `USER1` on the server `Server1`, type:
  ```shell
  query user USER1 /server:Server1
  ```
