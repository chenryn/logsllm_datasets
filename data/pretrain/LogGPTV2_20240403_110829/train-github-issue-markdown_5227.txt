### Describe the problem
This is a request to update documentation to include minimal system
requirements, especially the description for Docker images that include
prebuilt binaries.
For example, the main Docker image on DockerHub (tensorflow/tensorflow, 19M
downloads) currently does not operate on CPU's without AVX support. This
includes CPUs sold as recently as 4 years ago.
This requirement should be stated in the Docker image description displayed in
DockerHub. Perhaps also include a link to an alternative docker image that
users with non-AVX CPUs may utilize to build from source.
