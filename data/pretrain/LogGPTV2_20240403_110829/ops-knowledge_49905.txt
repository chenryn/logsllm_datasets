User: Has anyone tried using uWSGI with Cherokee? Can you share your experiences and what documents you relied upon the most? I am trying to get started from the documentation on both (uWSGI and Cherokee) websites. Nothing works yet. I am using Ubuntu 10.04.

Edit: To clarify, Cherokee has been working fine. I am getting the error message:

uWSGI Error, wsgi application not found

So something must be wrong with my configurations. Or maybe my application.
Assistant: There seems to be an issue with the 'make' method of installation on the uwsgi docs.  Use 'python uwsgiconfig.py --build' instead.  That worked for me.  Cherokee, Django running on Ubuntu 10.10.
