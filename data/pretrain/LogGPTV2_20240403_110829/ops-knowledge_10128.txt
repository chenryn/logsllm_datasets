User: Normally, I would use "blender -P script.py" to run a python script. In this case, a new blender process is started to execute the script. What I am trying to do now is to run a script using a blender process that is already running, instead of starting a new one.
I have not seen any source on this issue so far, which makes me concern about the actual feasibility of this approach. 
Any help would be appreciated.
Assistant: My solution was to launch Blender via console with a python script (blender --python script.py) that contains a while loop and creates a server socket to receive requests to process some specific code. The loop will prevent blender from opening the GUI, and the socket will handle the multiple requests inside the same blender process.
