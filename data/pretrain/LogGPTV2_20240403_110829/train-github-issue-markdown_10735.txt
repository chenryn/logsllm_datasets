How about having some kind of insert mode , such that screen can be abstracted
as text and we can select some text from anywhere?
So , say I am doing git pull , it failed throwing error that "error: Your
local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:"
Now I want to get the name of that file I have to use mouse to go up and copy
and paste the file name , instead if I have some kind of insert mode , the
terminal will behave as text and I can move my cursor up , select and copy
relevant line, press some kind of escape sequence and paste the copied text in
next command.
This is Quick Edit mode / Mark mode in command line
