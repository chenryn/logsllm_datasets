 We all hear about 
anti-phishing gadgets 
that cost an arm and a 
leg.
 I’m here to tell you 
why you’ll pay for it, 
even though it 
doesn’t work.
Because you’re going to 
fall into the trap, just 
like everyone else.  Plan 
to fail now.
 Let’s get on with it.

 "Please mail us your 
username, password 
and token." 
 People won’t federate
 People lose them, type 
them in backwards, 
etc... etc...
 Can anyone beat the 
record of 13 keyfobs?!

 Hackers don't use 
.bank and no one 
notices anyway.  
 Only banks can 
use it?  Can I 
have .momandpa 
pls?
 Wait, why again 
are we building 
another EV Cert?

 Phishers don't 
use SSL 
 Prohibitively 
expensive for 
ma and pa 
retailers 
 Users don't get 
it anyway
 Look for the 
lock 
messaging is 
lost

 MIT study – People 
don’t notice if it’s 
changed or even not 
there at all!
 Man in the middle 
attacks
 Phishers can simply 
say, “We lost your 
sitekey image, could 
you pick a new one, 
kthksbye”

 The vast 
majority of 
trusted sites 
still have:
XSS
CSRF
SQLInjection
Command 
injection

 Don't use any sort of email, 
phone or FAX encryption 
with their customers/clients
 Don't have any brute force 
detection (or if they do, only 
vertical)
 Don't force strong 
passwords, auto log out, 
automatic password change, 
etc...
 Do have downloads over 
HTTP!  Weee!

 Yup, you’re going to pay 
for all those same nearly 
pointless security doo-
dads even though you 
haven’t fixed any of your 
other issues!

 Bear analogy. (I hate 
that analogy, btw).  We 
are bidding up our 
security.
 Yes, you will probably 
buy snake oil, just like 
everyone else.
 Can you blame the 
vendors for 
monetizing our 
problems with the 
latest security widget?
 Plan to fail - you’re 
probably already 
doing it!
