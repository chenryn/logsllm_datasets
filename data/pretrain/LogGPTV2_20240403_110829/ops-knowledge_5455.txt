User: I installed Anaconda for Python 2.7 on my Windows machine and wanted to add the Anaconda interpreter to PyDev, but quick googling couldn't find the default place where Anaconda installed, and searching SO didn't turn up anything useful, so.
Where does Anaconda 4.0 install on Windows 7?
Assistant: where conda
F:\Users\christos\Anaconda3\Library\bin\conda.bat
F:\Users\christos\Anaconda3\Scripts\conda.exe
F:\Users\christos\Anaconda3\condabin\conda.bat
F:\Users\christos\Anaconda3\Scripts\conda.exe --version
conda 4.6.11
this worked for me
