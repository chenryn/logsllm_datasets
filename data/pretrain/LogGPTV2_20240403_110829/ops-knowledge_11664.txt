User: Please introduce the virtualization technologies under the cloud computing architecture, including virtual machines, containers, etc., and briefly explain their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: The virtualization technology under the cloud computing architecture generally has two types: virtual machine (Virtual Machine, VM for short) and container (Container). Virtual machine refers to the technology of using virtual machine software to create multiple virtual computers on one physical computer. Each virtual computer is independent, with its own operating system, applications, and configuration files, with isolation and resource allocation between them by the hypervisor. The advantage of virtual machine technology is that they provide higher isolation and security, and are suitable for running different operating systems or multiple applications on the same server. However, the disadvantage of virtual machine technologies is that they require more resources (such as storage, memory, CPU) and are slower to start and stop. A container is a lightweight virtualization technology that isolates and packages applications and their dependencies at the operating system level so that they can run independently on the same physical machine. Compared with virtual machine technology, container technology has the advantages of fast startup speed, low resource consumption, and strong scalability, and is suitable for rapid deployment and continuous integration and delivery of applications. However, the isolation and security of container technology are relatively weak, resource division between containers is difficult, and different operating systems cannot be isolated. In general, virtual machines and container technologies should be selected and matched according to different scenarios and requirements in practical applications to achieve better performance, security and maintainability.
