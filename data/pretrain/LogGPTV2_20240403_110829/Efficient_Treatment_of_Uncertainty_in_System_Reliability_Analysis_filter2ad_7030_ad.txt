the MTTF of the system when, for all the components, failure
rate λi is equal to λU B
, respectively.
The failure rate of the components in Benes and Synth-
II are selected such that we have few components with
relatively low failure rates compared to the majority of the
components. This actually allows us to study the effect of rare
events. Rare events are component failures that are statistically
“improbable” and occur with low frequency. Despite being
statically improbable, the consequence of such events may be
visible at system level. However, typically the MC simulation-
based techniques are unlikely to observe these events. There-
fore, studying the capability of a sampling technique not
to neglect rare events is an important topic. To model rare
events, we assume that the diversity of the failure rates among
the components is signiﬁcant only when the components
have high failure rates. With lower failure rates, this effect
disappears. For example, consider two components xi and xj
with λi = [0.01, 0.03] and λj = [0.03, 0.1], respectively. The
lower bound failure rates of these components are similarly
low. For evaluating MTTFupper, the simulation-based ST in [4]
must increase the number of simulations to observe the failures
in both components. However, for evaluating MTTFlower and
MTTFmean, if we have more components similar to xj, it is
very probable that the technique fails to capture the failures
in component xi due to its relatively low failure rate (in this
case a failure in xi is a rare event).
The results in Table IV show that in all the experiments,
the IM-driven approach provides more accurate results than the
ST-based one. Also, the error rate of both techniques increases
for test problems Benes and Synth-II. However, the inaccuracy
of the ST-based technique is more remarkable which is due
to neglecting the rare events while calculating MTTFlower and
MTTFmean. Moreover, the error rate eMTTFupper for these test
problems is again low for both techniques because we assume
that there is no rare event among the components with failure
rate λLB. It can be concluded that the IM-driven approach is
better at observing the rare failures of the components.
B. IM-Aware Sampling
Finally, the proposed IM-aware Sampling (IMS) technique
as shown in Figure 3 (c) is compared with the Latin Hypercube
Sampling (LHS) and Jittered Sampling (JS), i. e., homoge-
neous stratifying (HS), in terms of accuracy in uncertainty

analysis. To this end, these sampling technique are incorpo-
rated into reliability analysis, and the uncertainty distributions
are calculated for the MTTF of each implementation candi-
date. Moreover, an accurate BDD-based reliability analysis is
employed in order to consider only the contribution of the
sampling process in the resulting inaccuracy. Note that each
component reliability is modeled using exponential reliability
functions with failure rates given as probability distributions.
Figure 9 shows the obtained Cumulative Distribution Func-
tions (CDFs) for the MTTF of the implementation candidate
under analysis. CDF is commonly used to present the results of
uncertainty analysis [18] and can clearly show if an estimated
uncertainty distribution matches the intended distribution. To
evaluate the accuracy of sampling,
the reference CDF is
obtained by employing Simple Random Sampling (SRS) with
100, 000 samples, whereas the compared sampling techniques
are limited to a more realistic sample size of 5, 000. The results
show that the uncertainty analysis incorporating the proposed
IMS, compared to the LHS and HS, provides a considerably
better approximation to the reference CDF while keeping the
distribution shape.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Uncertainty in the reliability of today’s electronic compo-
nents is inevitable. Therefore, its incorporation into analysis
techniques is a requisite for the design of reliable systems
from unreliable components with uncertain characteristics.
This paper ﬁrst presents a reliability analysis technique which
employs Taylor expansions to measure the change in the sys-
tem reliability given the changes (caused by uncertainty) in the
reliability of components. Given the uncertainty distributions
of components, we propose a stratiﬁed sampling technique
based on the notion of component importance. Therein, we
ﬁrst rank the components regarding their contribution (or
importance) to the reliability of their system. Second, a
heterogeneous stratiﬁcation technique is proposed which cuts
the sample space of components with high importance ﬁnely
to improve their space ﬁlling. Similarly, the components with
low importance get less attention by stratifying their sample
space more coarsely to reduce the total number of samples
and to keep the execution time low. The experimental results
show that the proposed technique performs more efﬁciently
and approximates the uncertainty distribution at system level
more accurately than previously proposed techniques.
