#### MTTF Analysis and Rare Events
The Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) of the system is evaluated when all components have a failure rate, \(\lambda_i\), equal to \(\lambda_{UB}\). In the Benes and Synth-II systems, the failure rates of the components are selected such that a few components have relatively low failure rates compared to the majority. This setup allows for the study of rare events, which are component failures that are statistically improbable and occur infrequently. Despite their low probability, the consequences of these rare events can be significant at the system level. However, traditional Monte Carlo (MC) simulation-based techniques often fail to observe such rare events. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the capability of sampling techniques to capture these rare events.

To model rare events, we assume that the diversity in failure rates among components is significant only when the components have high failure rates. For lower failure rates, this effect diminishes. For instance, consider two components \(x_i\) and \(x_j\) with failure rates \(\lambda_i = [0.01, 0.03]\) and \(\lambda_j = [0.03, 0.1]\), respectively. The lower bound failure rates of these components are similarly low. When evaluating \(MTTF_{upper}\), the simulation-based Success Tree (ST) method from [4] must increase the number of simulations to observe failures in both components. However, for evaluating \(MTTF_{lower}\) and \(MTTF_{mean}\), if there are more components similar to \(x_j\), the technique may fail to capture the failures in component \(x_i\) due to its relatively low failure rate, making a failure in \(x_i\) a rare event.

#### Experimental Results
The results in Table IV show that in all experiments, the Importance Measure (IM)-driven approach provides more accurate results than the ST-based method. The error rate for both techniques increases for the Benes and Synth-II test problems. However, the inaccuracy of the ST-based technique is more pronounced, primarily due to its neglect of rare events while calculating \(MTTF_{lower}\) and \(MTTF_{mean}\). Additionally, the error rate \(eMTTF_{upper}\) for these test problems is low for both techniques, as we assume no rare events among components with failure rate \(\lambda_{LB}\). It can be concluded that the IM-driven approach is better at observing rare failures in components.

#### IM-Aware Sampling
Finally, the proposed IM-aware Sampling (IMS) technique, as shown in Figure 3(c), is compared with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Jittered Sampling (JS), i.e., homogeneous stratifying (HS), in terms of accuracy in uncertainty analysis. Each component's reliability is modeled using exponential reliability functions with failure rates given as probability distributions. Figure 9 shows the Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) for the MTTF of the implementation candidate under analysis. CDFs are commonly used to present the results of uncertainty analysis and can clearly show if an estimated uncertainty distribution matches the intended distribution. The reference CDF is obtained using Simple Random Sampling (SRS) with 100,000 samples, while the compared sampling techniques are limited to a more realistic sample size of 5,000. The results indicate that the uncertainty analysis incorporating the proposed IMS provides a considerably better approximation to the reference CDF while maintaining the distribution shape.

### Conclusions
Uncertainty in the reliability of electronic components is inevitable, and its incorporation into analysis techniques is essential for designing reliable systems from unreliable components with uncertain characteristics. This paper presents a reliability analysis technique that uses Taylor expansions to measure changes in system reliability due to changes in component reliability. Given the uncertainty distributions of components, we propose a stratified sampling technique based on the notion of component importance. The experimental results show that the proposed technique performs more efficiently and accurately approximates the uncertainty distribution at the system level compared to previously proposed techniques.
