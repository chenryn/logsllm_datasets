**ATT&CK ID:** T1049  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** System Network Connections Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to obtain a list of network connections to or from the compromised system they are currently accessing, or from remote systems, by querying for information over the network. This technique allows them to gather details about active network connections, which can be used to map the network, identify potential targets, and understand the communication patterns within the environment.
