User: How to deploy a high-availability system to ensure 24-hour uninterrupted operation?
Assistant: To deploy a high-availability system, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Determine high-availability requirements: First, you need to clarify the requirements and goals of high availability. For example, if the system is required to run uninterrupted within 24 hours, it must have multi-layer redundancy, automatic fault recovery and load balancing, etc. 2. Architecture design: According to the actual situation, design an architecture to support high availability. Common architectures include redundant servers, virtualization platforms, load balancers, containerization, standing master and backup, and more. These architectures can provide flexible configuration and failover, enabling redundancy when necessary. 3. Dual-machine hot backup: Set up dual-machine hot backup, which can automatically switch when a failure occurs to ensure uninterrupted service. The specific implementation can use high-availability software, such as Pacemaker+Corosync, or Symantec Cluster. 4. Data backup and recovery: Set up timely and effective data backup and recovery to ensure that the required data is always in a safe state, and the backup data must be restored to its original state in the shortest possible time. 5. Network guarantee: ensure the reliability of network communication, adopt multi-line, two-way heartbeat, multi-path routing and other technologies to ensure that there are multiple communication paths between devices, and faulty devices can be automatically switched to standby devices. 6. Monitoring and alarming: Real-time monitoring and alarming to detect and resolve faults in time. In this way, the system is always running, under close supervision, and high availability can be ensured in the actual production process.
