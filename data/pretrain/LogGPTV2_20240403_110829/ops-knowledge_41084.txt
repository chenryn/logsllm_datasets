User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it possible make brute-force attacks ineffective by giving false positive answers to failed log-in attempts? I don't have any experience or scientific knowledge in security, I just wanted to ask if this is possible because I am interested in it.

What if I encrypt data and every password decrypts it, but only the right one does not create pointless data clutter?
Same could be done with a login: false login data leads to fake, dummy accounts and only the right login details get you to the right accounts.

Wouldn't this be a way better method of encryption because you couldn't just try out passwords but had to look at the outcome to see if it was the right one?

Assistant: The answer always depends on your threat model.  Security is always woven into a balance between security and usability.  Your approach inconveniences the hackers trying to break into the account, but also inconveniences a user who merely mistypes their password.  If the fake account is believable enough to fool an attacker, it may also be believable enough to fool a valid user.  That could be very bad.

This may be desirable in extremely high risk environments.  If you had to store nuclear secrets out in the open on the internet, having every failed password lead you to an account that has access to fake documents which don't actually reveal national secrets could be quite powerful.  However, for most cases it is unnecessary.

You also have to consider the alternatives.  A very popular approach is to lock the account out after N attempts, which basically stops all brute force attempts cold, and has usability behaviors that most users are willing to accept.
