### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:10:15 to 18:10:20 on October 18, highlights several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process (PID: `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`) is unable to renew the lease for the `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` client. The failure persists for a duration ranging from 317 to 322 seconds. The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly.

2. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes are detected by both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes. The old address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:port` is updated to `msra-sa-41:port`, where the port numbers are 9000 and 8030, respectively.

3. **Connection Retries**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process (PID: `RMCommunicator Allocator`) is attempting to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. It is using a retry policy with a maximum of 10 retries, each with a 1-second sleep interval (`RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`).

4. **Resource Manager (RM) Contact Errors**:
   - The `RMContainerAllocator` component (part of the `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm` package) is experiencing errors while trying to contact the Resource Manager (RM). This error is logged multiple times, indicating a persistent issue.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Log Levels**:
  - The logs span from 18:10:15 to 18:10:20, with varying log levels: `WARN`, `INFO`, and `ERROR`.

- **LeaseRenewer Process**:
  - **Component**: `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`
  - **Issue**: Failed to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` for 317 to 322 seconds.
  - **Action**: Will retry shortly.

- **RMCommunicator Allocator Process**:
  - **Component**: `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`
  - **Issue**: Detected address changes and failed to contact the RM server.
  - **Action**: Retrying the connection with a retry policy of up to 10 attempts, each with a 1-second delay.

- **RMContainerAllocator Component**:
  - **Component**: `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`
  - **Issue**: Encountered errors while contacting the RM.
  - **Log Level**: `ERROR`

### Conclusion

The log entries indicate a series of recurring issues, including lease renewal failures, address changes, and connection errors to the Resource Manager. These issues are being handled with retry mechanisms, but the persistence of the errors suggests a deeper underlying problem that may require further investigation and resolution.
