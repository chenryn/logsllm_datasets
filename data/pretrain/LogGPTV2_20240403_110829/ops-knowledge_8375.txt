Assistant: This log chunk shows that the LeaseRenewer process is failing to renew a lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1] for 317-322 seconds. The RMCommunicator Allocator process is also failing to contact the RM server. Both processes are detecting address changes from msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170 to msra-sa-41. The RMCommunicator Allocator is retrying the connection up to 10 times with a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds.
