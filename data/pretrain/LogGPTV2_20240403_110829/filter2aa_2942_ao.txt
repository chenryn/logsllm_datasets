INCIDENT REPORTING | SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Communications of security incident information from the 
enterprise to suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers and vice versa require protection. The enterprise should ensure that 
information is reviewed and approved for sending based on its agreements with suppliers and any 
relevant interagency bodies. Any escalation of or exception from this reporting should be clearly 
defined in the agreement. The enterprise should ensure that incident reporting data is adequately 
protected for transmission and received by approved individuals only. Enterprises should require their

FAMILY: MAINTENANCE  
[FIPS 200] specifies the Maintenance minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) perform periodic and timely maintenance on organizational 
information systems; and (ii) provide effective controls on the tools, techniques, 
mechanisms, and personnel used to conduct information system maintenance.  
Maintenance is frequently performed by an entity that is separate from the enterprise. As such, 
maintenance becomes part of the supply chain. Maintenance includes performing updates and 
replacements. C-SCRM should be applied to maintenance situations, including assessing 
exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, selecting C-SCRM controls, 
implementing those controls, and monitoring them for effectiveness.  
MA-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that C-SCRM is included in maintenance 
policies and procedures and any related SCRM Strategy/Implementation Plan, SCRM Policies, and SCRM 
Plan(s) for all enterprise information systems and networks. With many maintenance contracts, information 
on mission-, enterprise-, and system-specific objectives and requirements is shared between the enterprise 
and its suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-
related service providers, allowing for vulnerabilities and opportunities for attack. In many cases, the 
maintenance of systems is outsourced to a system integrator, and as such, appropriate measures must be 
taken. Even when maintenance is not outsourced, the supply chain affects upgrades, patches, the frequency 
of maintenance, replacement parts, and other aspects of system maintenance.  
Maintenance policies should be defined for both the system and the network. The maintenance policy 
should reflect controls based on a risk assessment (including criticality analysis), such as remote access, the 
roles and attributes of maintenance personnel who have access, the frequency of updates, duration of the 
contract, the logistical path and method used for updates or maintenance, and monitoring and audit 
mechanisms. The maintenance policy should state which tools are explicitly allowed or not allowed. For 
example, in the case of software maintenance, the contract should state the source code, test cases, and 
other item accessibility needed to maintain a system or components.  
Maintenance policies should be refined and augmented at each level. At Level 1, the policy should 
explicitly assert that C-SCRM should be applied throughout the SDLC, including maintenance activities. 
At Level 2, the policy should reflect the mission operation’s needs and critical functions. At Level 3, it 
should reflect the specific system needs. The requirements in Level 1, such as nonlocal maintenance, 
should flow to Level 2 and Level 3. For example, when nonlocal maintenance is not allowed by Level 1, it 
should also not be allowed at Level 2 or Level 3. 
The enterprise should communicate applicable maintenance policy requirements to relevant prime 
contractors and require that they implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier 
contractors.

Control Enhancement(s): 
(1) CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE |AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that all automated maintenance activities 
for supply chain systems and networks are controlled and managed according to the maintenance 
policy. Examples of automated maintenance activities can include COTS product patch updates, call 
home features with failure notification feedback, etc. Managing these activities may require 
establishing staging processes with appropriate supporting mechanisms to provide vetting or filtering 
as appropriate. Staging processes may be especially important for critical systems and components.  
Level(s): 3 
MA-3 
MAINTENANCE TOOLS  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Maintenance tools are considered part of the supply chain. They also 
have a supply chain of their own. C-SCRM should be integrated when the enterprise acquires or upgrades a 
maintenance tool (e.g., an update to the development environment or testing tool), including during the 
selection, ordering, storage, and integration of the maintenance tool. The enterprise should perform 
continuous review and approval of maintenance tools, including those maintenance tools in use by external 
service providers. The enterprise should also integrate C-SCRM when evaluating replacement parts for 
maintenance tools. This control may be performed at both Level 2 and Level 3, depending on how an 
agency handles the acquisition, operations, and oversight of maintenance tools. 
Level(s): 2, 3  
Control Enhancement(s):

MAINTENANCE TOOLS | INSPECT TOOLS  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should deploy acceptance testing to verify that the 
maintenance tools of the ICT supply chain infrastructure are as expected. Maintenance tools should be 
authorized with appropriate paperwork, verified as claimed through initial verification, and tested for 
vulnerabilities, appropriate security configurations, and stated functionality. 
Level(s): 3 
(2) 
MAINTENANCE TOOLS | INSPECT MEDIA  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should verify that the media containing diagnostic 
and test programs that suppliers use on the enterprise’s information systems operates as expected and 
provides only required functions. The use of media from maintenance tools should be consistent with 
the enterprise’s policies and procedures and pre-approved. Enterprises should also ensure that the 
functionality does not exceed that which was agreed upon.   
Level(s): 3 
(3) 
MAINTENANCE TOOLS | PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED REMOVAL  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The unauthorized removal of systems and network maintenance 
tools from the supply chain may introduce supply chain risks, such as unauthorized modification, 
replacement with counterfeit, or malware insertion while the tool is outside of the enterprise’s control. 
Systems and network maintenance tools can include an integrated development environment (IDE), 
testing, or vulnerability scanning. For C-SCRM, it is important that enterprises should explicitly 
authorize, track, and audit any removal of maintenance tools. Once systems and network tools are 
allowed access to an enterprise/information system, they should remain the property/asset of the 
system owner and tracked if removed and used elsewhere in the enterprise. ICT maintenance tools

NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Nonlocal maintenance may be provided by contractor personnel. 
Appropriate protections should be in place to manage associated risks. Controls applied to internal 
maintenance personnel are applied to any suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers performing a similar maintenance role and enforced 
through contractual agreements with their external service providers.

NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE | COMPARABLE SECURITY AND SANITIZATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Should suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, or other ICT/OT-related service providers perform any nonlocal maintenance or 
diagnostic services on systems or system components, the enterprise should ensure that: 
• 
Appropriate measures are taken to verify that the nonlocal environment meets appropriate 
security levels for maintenance and diagnostics per agreements between the enterprise and 
vendor; 
• 
Appropriate levels of sanitizing are completed to remove any enterprise-specific data residing 
in components; and 
• 
Appropriate diagnostics are completed to ensure that components are sanitized, preventing 
malicious insertion prior to returning to the enterprise system or supply chain network. 
The enterprise should require its prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.

MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Maintenance personnel may be employed by suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, or other ICT/OT-related service providers. As such, 
appropriate protections should be in place to manage associated risks. The same controls applied to internal 
maintenance personnel should be applied to any contractor personnel who performs a similar maintenance 
role and enforced through contractual agreements with their external service providers.

TIMELY MAINTENANCE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should purchase spare parts, replacement parts, or 
alternative sources through original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), authorized distributors, or 
authorized resellers and ensure appropriate lead times. If OEMs are not available, it is preferred to acquire 
from authorized distributors. If an OEM or an authorized distributor is not available, then it is preferred to 
acquire from an authorized reseller. Enterprises should obtain verification on whether the distributor or 
reseller is authorized. Where possible, enterprises should use an authorized distributor/dealer approved list. 
If the only alternative is to purchase from a non-authorized distributor or secondary market, a risk 
assessment should be performed, including revisiting the criticality and threat analysis to identify additional 
risk mitigations to be used. For example, the enterprise should check the supply source for a history of 
counterfeits, inappropriate practices, or a criminal record. See Section 2 for criticality and threat analysis 
details. The enterprise should maintain a bench stock of critical OEM parts, if feasible, when the 
acquisition of such parts may not be accomplished within needed timeframes.

MAINTENANCE MONITORING AND INFORMATION SHARING (NEW) 
Control: The enterprise monitors the status of systems and components and communicates out-of-bounds 
and out-of-spec performance to suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, 
and other ICT/OT-related service providers. The enterprise should also report this information to the 
Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP). 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Tracking the failure rates of components provides useful information to 
the acquirer to help plan for contingencies, alternative sources of supply, and replacements. Failure rates 
are also useful for monitoring the quality and reliability of systems and components. This information 
provides useful feedback to suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, 
and other ICT/OT-related service providers for corrective action and continuous improvement. In Level 2, 
agencies should track and communicate the failure rates to suppliers (OEM and/or an authorized 
distributor). The failure rates and the issues that can indicate failures, including root causes, should be 
identified by an enterprise’s technical personnel (e.g., developers, administrators, or maintenance 
engineers) in Level 3 and communicated to Level 2. These individuals are able to verify the problem and 
identify technical alternatives.

FAMILY: MEDIA PROTECTION 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Media Protection minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) protect information system media, both paper and digital; (ii) 
limit access to information on information system media to authorized users; and (iii) 
sanitize or destroy information system media before disposal or release for reuse.  
Media itself can be a component traversing the supply chain or containing information about the 
enterprise’s supply chain. This includes both physical and logical media, such as system 
documentation on paper or in electronic files, shipping and delivery documentation with acquirer 
information, memory sticks with software code, or complete routers or servers that include 
permanent media. The information contained on the media may be sensitive or proprietary 
information. Additionally, the media is used throughout the SDLC, from concept to disposal. 
Enterprises should ensure that media protection controls are applied to both an enterprise’s 
media and the media received from suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers throughout the SDLC. 
MP-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Various documents and information on a variety of physical and 
electronic media are disseminated throughout the supply chain. This information may contain a variety of 
sensitive information and intellectual property from suppliers, developers, system integrators, external 
system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers and should be appropriately 
protected. Media protection policies and procedures should also address supply chain concerns, including 
media in the enterprise’s supply chain and throughout the SDLC.  
Level(s): 1, 2

MEDIA STORAGE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Media storage controls should include C-SCRM activities. Enterprises 
should specify and include in agreements (e.g., contracting language) media storage requirements (e.g., 
encryption) for their suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers. The enterprise should require its prime contractors to implement this 
control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.

MEDIA SANITIZATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should specify and include in agreements (e.g., contracting 
language) media sanitization policies for their suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Media is used throughout the SDLC. Media 
traversing or residing in the supply chain may originate anywhere, including from suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. It can be 
new, refurbished, or reused. Media sanitization is critical to ensuring that information is removed before the 
media is used, reused, or discarded. For media that contains privacy or other sensitive information (e.g., 
CUI), the enterprise should require its prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.

FAMILY: PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  
[FIPS 200] specifies the Physical and Environmental Protection minimum security requirement 
as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) limit physical access to information systems, equipment, and the 
respective operating environments to authorized individuals; (ii) protect the physical 
plant and support infrastructure for information systems; iii) provide supporting utilities 
for information systems; (iv) protect information systems against environmental hazards; 
and (v) provide appropriate environmental controls in facilities containing information 
systems.  
Supply chains span the physical and logical world. Physical factors can include weather and road 
conditions that may impact the transportation of cyber components (or devices) from one 
location to another between persons or enterprises within a supply chain. If not properly 
addressed as a part of the C-SCRM risk management processes, physical and environmental risks 
may have negative impacts on the enterprise’s ability to receive critical components in a timely 
manner, which may in turn impact their ability to perform mission operations. Enterprises should 
require the implementation of appropriate physical and environmental controls within their 
supply chain. 
PE-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should integrate C-SCRM practices and requirements 
into their own physical and environmental protection policy and procedures. The degree of protection 
should be commensurate with the degree of integration. The physical and environmental protection policy
