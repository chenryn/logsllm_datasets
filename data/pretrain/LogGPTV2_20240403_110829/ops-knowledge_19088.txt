User: If I place my project in /usr/bin/
will my python interpreter generate bytecode?  If so where does it put them as the files do not have write permission in that folder.  Does it cache them in a temp file?
If not, is there a performance loss for me putting the project there?
I have packaged this up as a .deb file that is installed from my Ubuntu ppa, so the obvious place to install the project is in /usr/bin/
but if I don't generate byte code by putting it there what should I do?  Can I give the project write permission if it installs on another persons machine?  that would seem to be a security risk.
There are surely lots of python projects installed in Ubuntu ( and obviously other distros ) how do they deal with this?
Thanks
Assistant: .pyc/.pyo files are not generated for scripts that are run directly. Python modules placed where Python modules are normally expected and packaged up have the .pyc/.pyo files generated at either build time or install time, and so aren't the end user's problem.
