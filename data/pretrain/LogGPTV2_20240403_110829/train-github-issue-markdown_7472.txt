Currently routing and ID values can be passed in the query string and url
respectively, but they can also be extracted from fields within the document.
This has a significant performance impact because each doc needs to be parsed
on the node which receives the index/get/update/delete request in order to
know which node should handle the request.
On top of that, there are clashes between (eg) routing values set in fields
and parent settings.
We should deprecate the functionality to extract these values from fields, and
make it the responsibility of the client code instead.
It should still be possible to set `_routing` to required. Perhaps we should
set this automatically if the user ever passes in a routing or parent value at
index time?
