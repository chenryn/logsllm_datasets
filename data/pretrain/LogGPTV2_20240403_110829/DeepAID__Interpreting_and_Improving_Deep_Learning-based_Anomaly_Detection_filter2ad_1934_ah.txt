6. For Kitsune, we use the dataset collected from a IoT (Internet-
of-Things) network in its work. We additionally use another open
dataset for network intrusion detection called CIC-IDS2017 [43], in
order to collect various types of attack traffic for the evaluation of
reliable detection by Distiller in §6.5. CIC-IDS2017 collected traffic
for various common attacks in a large-scale testbed, which covers
many common devices and middleboxes in the network. Anom-
alies indicate various types of network attacks. For DeepLog, we
use HDFS dataset [57] which is the same dataset evaluated in its
work. This dataset consists of key number sequence of Hadoop
file system logs, and anomalies indicate malfunction or malicious
behavior in the file system. For GLGV, we also use a dataset evalu-
ated in its original work called LANL-CMSCSE[27], which collects
tons of multi-source events of a real internal computer network
in 58 consecutive days. Here we mainly use authentication events
collected from individual devices. Anomalies here indicate lateral
movement in the APT campaign.
