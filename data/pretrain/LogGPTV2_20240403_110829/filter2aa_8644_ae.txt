## Captive portal
When macOS connects to new networks, it checks for Internet connectivity and may launch a Captive Portal assistant utility application.
An attacker could trigger the utility and direct a Mac to a site with malware without user interaction, so it's best to disable this feature and log in to captive portals using your regular Web browser by navigating to a non-secure HTTP page and accepting a redirect to the captive portal login interface (after disabling any custom proxy or DNS settings).
```console
$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.captive.control.plist Active -bool false
```

## Certificate authorities
macOS comes with [over 200](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202858) root authority certificates installed from for-profit corporations like Apple, Verisign, Thawte, Digicert and government agencies from China, Japan, Netherlands, U.S., and more! These Certificate Authorities (CAs) are capable of issuing SSL/TLS certificates for any domain, code signing certificates, etc.
For more information, see [Certification Authority Trust Tracker](https://github.com/kirei/catt), [Analysis of the HTTPS certificate ecosystem](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2013/papers/imc257-durumericAemb.pdf) (pdf), and [You Won’t Be Needing These Any More: On Removing Unused Certificates From Trust Stores](https://www.ifca.ai/fc14/papers/fc14_submission_100.pdf) (pdf).
Inspect system root certificates in **Keychain Access**, under the **System Roots** tab or by using the `security` command line tool and `/System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain` file.
Disable certificate authorities through Keychain Access by marking them as **Never Trust** and closing the window:
The risk of a [man in the middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attack in which a coerced or compromised certificate authority trusted by your system issues a fake/rogue SSL certificate is quite low, but still [possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates).
## OpenSSL
**Note** This section [may be out of date](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/356).
The version of OpenSSL in Sierra is `0.9.8zh` which is [not current](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/200582/why-is-apple-using-an-older-version-of-openssl). It doesn't support TLS 1.1 or newer, elliptic curve ciphers, and [more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27502215/difference-between-openssl-09-8z-and-1-0-1).
Since Apple's official supported TLS library on macOS is [Secure Transport](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secure_transport), OpenSSL **deprecated** is considered deprecated (according to the [Cryptographic Services Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/cryptoservices/GeneralPurposeCrypto/GeneralPurposeCrypto.html). Apple's version of OpenSSL may also have patches which may [surprise you](https://hynek.me/articles/apple-openssl-verification-surprises/).
If you're going to use OpenSSL on your Mac, download and install a recent version of OpenSSL with `brew install openssl`. Note, linking brew to be used in favor of `/usr/bin/openssl` may interfere with built-in software. See [issue #39](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/39).
Compare the TLS protocol and cipher between the homebrew version and the system version of OpenSSL:
```console
$ ~/homebrew/bin/openssl version; echo | ~/homebrew/bin/openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 2>&1 | grep -A2 SSL-Session
OpenSSL 1.0.2j  26 Sep 2016
SSL-Session:
    Protocol  : TLSv1.2
    Cipher    : ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
$ /usr/bin/openssl version; echo | /usr/bin/openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 2>&1 | grep -A2 SSL-Session
OpenSSL 0.9.8zh 14 Jan 2016
SSL-Session:
    Protocol  : TLSv1
    Cipher    : AES128-SHA
```
See also [Comparison of TLS implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TLS_implementations), [How's My SSL](https://www.howsmyssl.com/) and [Qualys SSL Labs Tools](https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/).
## Curl
The version of Curl which comes with macOS uses [Secure Transport](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Reference/secureTransportRef/) for SSL/TLS validation.
If you prefer to use OpenSSL, install with `brew install curl --with-openssl` and ensure it's the default with `brew link --force curl`
Download [drduh/config/curlrc](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/curlrc) or see the [man page](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html):
```console
$ curl -o ~/.curlrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/curlrc
```
## Web
### Privoxy
Consider using [Privoxy](https://www.privoxy.org/) as a local proxy to filter Web browsing traffic.
**Note** macOS proxy settings are not universal; apps and services may not honor system proxy settings. Ensure the application you wish to proxy is correctly configured and manually verify connections don't leak. Additionally, it may be possible to configure the *pf* firewall to transparently proxy all traffic.
A signed installation package for privoxy can be downloaded from [silvester.org.uk](https://silvester.org.uk/privoxy/Macintosh%20%28OS%20X%29/) or [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ijbswa/files/Macintosh%20%28OS%20X%29/). The signed package is [more secure](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/65) than the Homebrew version, and attracts full support from the Privoxy project.
Alternatively, install and start privoxy using Homebrew:
```console
$ brew install privoxy
$ brew services start privoxy
```
By default, privoxy listens on localhost, TCP port 8118.
Set the system **HTTP** proxy for your active network interface `127.0.0.1` and `8118` (This can be done through **System Preferences > Network > Advanced > Proxies**):
```console
$ sudo networksetup -setwebproxy "Wi-Fi" 127.0.0.1 8118
```
**(Optional)** Set the system **HTTPS** proxy, which still allows for domain name filtering, with:
```console
$ sudo networksetup -setsecurewebproxy "Wi-Fi" 127.0.0.1 8118
```
Confirm the proxy is set:
```console
$ scutil --proxy
 {
  ExceptionsList :  {
    0 : *.local
    1 : 169.254/16
  }
  FTPPassive : 1
  HTTPEnable : 1
  HTTPPort : 8118
  HTTPProxy : 127.0.0.1
}
```
Visit  in a browser, or with Curl:
```console
$ ALL_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8118 curl -I http://p.p/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 2401
Content-Type: text/html
Cache-Control: no-cache
```
Privoxy already comes with many good rules, however you can also write your own.
Download [drduh/config/privoxy/config](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/privoxy/config) and [drduh/config/privoxy/user.action](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/privoxy/user.action) to get started:
```console
$ curl -o homebrew/etc/privoxy/config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/privoxy/config
$ curl -o homebrew/etc/privoxy/user.action https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/privoxy/user.action
```
Restart Privoxy and verify traffic is blocked or redirected:
```console
$ sudo brew services restart privoxy
$ ALL_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8118 curl ads.foo.com/ -IL
HTTP/1.1 403 Request blocked by Privoxy
Content-Type: image/gif
Content-Length: 64
Cache-Control: no-cache
$ ALL_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8118 curl imgur.com/ -IL
HTTP/1.1 302 Local Redirect from Privoxy
Location: https://imgur.com/
Content-Length: 0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
```
You can replace ad images with pictures of kittens, for example, by starting a local Web server and [redirecting blocked requests](https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/actions-file.html#SET-IMAGE-BLOCKER) to localhost.
### Browser
The Web browser poses the largest security and privacy risk, as its fundamental job is to download and execute untrusted code from the Internet. This is an important statement. The unique use case of Web Browsers of operation in hostile environments, has forced them to adopt certain impressive security features. The cornerstone of Web Browser security is the Same Origin Policy ([SOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)). In a few words, SOP prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model (DOM). If SOP is compromised, the security of the whole Web Browser is compromised.
The best tip to ensure secure browsing regardless your choice of Web Browser is proper security hygiene. The majority of Web Browser exploits require social engineering attacks to achieve native code execution. Always be mindful of the links you click and be extra careful when websites ask you to download and install software. 99% percent of the time that software is malware.
Another important consideration about Web Browser security is Web Extensions. Web Extensions greatly increase the attack surface of the Web Browser. This is an issue that plagues Firefox and [Chrome](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2016/files/24.pdf) alike. Luckily, Web Extensions can only access specific browser APIs that are being governed by their manifest. That means we can quickly audit their behavior and remove them if they request access to information they shouldn't (why would an Ad blocker require camera access?). In the interest of security, it is best to limit your use of Web Extensions.
[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), and [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) are covered in this guide. Each Web Browser offers certain benefits and drawbacks regarding their security and privacy. It is best to make an informed choice and not necessarily commit to only one.
#### Firefox
[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is an excellent browser as well as being completely open source. Currently, Firefox is in a renaissance period. It replaces major parts of its infrastructure and code base under projects [Quantum](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum) and [Photon](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Photon/Updates). Part of the Quantum project is to replace C++ code with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). Rust is a systems programming language with a focus on security and thread safety. It is expected that Rust adoption will greatly improve the overall security posture of Firefox.
Firefox offers a similar security model to Chrome: it has a [bug bounty program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/), although it is not a lucrative as Chrome's. Firefox follows a six-week release cycle similar to Chrome. See discussion in issues [#2](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/2) and [#90](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/90) for more information about certain differences in Firefox and Chrome.
Firefox supports user-supplied configuration files. See [drduh/config/user.js](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/user.js), [pyllyukko/user.js](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js) and [ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js) for recommended preferences and hardening measures. Also see [NoScript](https://noscript.net/), an extension which allows whitelist-based, pre-emptive script blocking.
Firefox is focused on user privacy. It supports [tracking protection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Privacy/Tracking_Protection) in Private Browsing mode. The tracking protection can be enabled for the default account, although it may break the browsing experience on some websites. Another feature for added privacy unique to Firefox is [Containers](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/containers), similar to Chrome profiles.
Previous versions of Firefox used a [Web Extension SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Legacy_add_ons) that was quite invasive and offered immense freedom to developers. Sadly, that freedom also introduced a number of vulnerabilities in Firefox that greatly affected its users. You can find more information about vulnerabilities introduced by Firefox's legacy extensions in this [paper](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/24541.pdf) (pdf). Currently, Firefox only supports Web Extensions through the [Web Extension Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions), which is very similar to Chrome's.
Submission of Web Extensions in Firefox is free. Web Extensions in Firefox most of the time are open source, although certain Web Extensions are proprietary.
**Note** Similar to Chrome and Safari, Firefox allows account sync across multiple devices. While stored login passwords are encrypted, Firefox does not require a password to reveal their plain text format. Firefox only displays as yes/no prompt. This is an important security issue. Keep that in mind if you sign in to your Firefox account from devices that do not belong to you and leave them unattended. The [issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393493) has been raised among the Firefox community and hopefully will be resolved in the coming versions.
See [drduh/config/firefox.user.js](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/firefox.user.js) for additional Firefox configuration options to improve security and privacy.
#### Chrome
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is based on the open source [Chromium project](https://www.chromium.org/Home) with certain [proprietary components](https://fossbytes.com/difference-google-chrome-vs-chromium-browser/):
* Automatic updates with GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon.
* Usage tracking and crash reporting, which can be disabled through Chrome's settings.
* Chrome Web Store.
* Adobe Flash Plugin - supports a Pepper API version of Adobe Flash which gets updated automatically with Chrome.
* Media Codec support - adds support for proprietary codecs.
* Chrome [PDF viewer](http://0xdabbad00.com/2013/01/13/most-secure-pdf-viewer-chrome-pdf-viewer/).
* Non-optional tracking. Google Chrome installer includes a randomly generated token. The token is sent to Google after the installation completes in order to measure the success rate. The RLZ identifier stores information – in the form of encoded strings – like the source of chrome download and installation week. It doesn’t include any personal information and it’s used to measure the effectiveness of a promotional campaign. **Chrome downloaded from Google’s website doesn’t have the RLZ identifier**. The source code to decode the strings is made open by Google.
Chrome offers account sync between multiple devices. Part of the sync data are stored website credentials. The login passwords are encrypted and in order to access them, a user's Google account password is required. You can use your Google account to sign to your Chrome customized settings from other devices while retaining your the security of your passwords.
Chrome's Web store for extensions requires a [5 dollar lifetime fee](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish#pay-the-developer-signup-fee) in order to submit extensions. The low cost allows the development of many quality Open Source Web Extensions that do not aim to monetize through usage.
Chrome has the largest share of global usage and is the preferred target platform for the majority of developers. Major technologies are based on Chrome's Open Source components, such as [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) which uses [Chrome's V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) Engine and the [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) framework, which is based on Chromium and node.js. Chrome's vast user base makes it the most attractive target for threat actors and security researchers. Despite under constants attacks, Chrome has retained an impressive security track record over the years. This is not a small feat.
Chrome offers [separate profiles](https://www.chromium.org/user-experience/multi-profiles), [sandboxing](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox), [frequent updates](https://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/) (including Flash, although you should disable it - see below), and carries [impressive credentials](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/brag-sheet). In addition, Google offers a very lucrative [bounty](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/chrome-rewards/) program for reporting vulnerabilities along with its own [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com). This means that a large number of highly talented and motivated people are constantly auditing Chrome's code base.
Create separate Chrome profiles to reduce XSS risk and compartmentalize cookies/identities. In each profile, either disable Javascript in Chrome settings and manually whitelist allowed origins - or use [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to manage Javascript and/or disable third-party scripts/frames. Also install [HTTPSEverywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) to upgrade insecure connections.
Change the default search engine from Google to reduce additional tracking.
Disable [DNS prefetching](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/dns-prefetching) (see also [DNS Prefetching and Its Privacy Implications](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/leet10/tech/full_papers/Krishnan.pdf) (pdf)). Note that Chrome [may attempt](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/350) to resolve DNS using Google's `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4` public nameservers.
Read [Chromium Security](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security) and [Chromium Privacy](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy) for more detailed, technical information.
Read [Google's privacy policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) and learn which [Google services](https://www.google.com/services/) collect personal information. Users can opt-out of services and see what type of information Google has stored in [account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/privacy).
#### Safari
[Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) is the default Web browser of macOS. It is also the most optimized browser for reducing battery use. Safari, like Chrome, has both Open Source and proprietary components. Safari is based on the open source Web Engine [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit), which is ubiquitous among the macOS ecosystem. WebKit is used by Apple apps such as Mail, iTunes, iBooks, and the App Store. Chrome's [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink) engine is a fork of WebKit and both engines share a number of similarities.
Safari supports certain unique features that benefit user security and privacy. [Content blockers](https://webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/) enables the creation of content blocking rules without using Javascript. This rule based approach greatly improves memory use, security, and privacy. Safari 11 introduced an [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/) system. This feature automatically removes tracking data stored in Safari after a period of non-interaction by the user from the tracker's website.
Similar to Chrome and Firefox, Safari offers an invite only [bounty program](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/) for bug reporting to a select number of security researchers. The bounty program was announced during Apple's [presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Krstic.pdf) at [BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#behind-the-scenes-of-ios-security) 2016.
Web Extensions in Safari have an additional option to use native code in the Safari's sandbox environment, in addition to Web Extension APIs. Web Extensions in Safari are also distributed through Apple's App store. App store submission comes with the added benefit of Web Extension code being audited by Apple. On the other hand App store submission comes at a steep cost. Yearly [developer subscription](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/) fee costs 100 USD (in contrast to Chrome's 5 dollar lifetime fee and Firefox's free submission). The high cost is prohibitive for the majority of Open Source developers. As a result, Safari has very few extensions to choose from. However, you should keep the high cost in mind when installing extensions. It is expected that most Web Extensions will have some way of monetizing usage in order to cover developer costs. Be wary of Web Extensions whose source code is not open.
Safari syncs user preferences and saved passwords with [iCloud Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202303). In order to be viewed in plain text, a user must input the account password of the current device. This means that users can sync data across devices with added security.
Safari follows a slower release cycle than Chrome and Firefox (3-4 minor releases, 1 major release, per year). Newer features are slower to be adopted to the stable channel. Although security updates in Safari are handled independent of the stable release schedule and issued automatically through the App store. The Safari channel that follows a six-week release cycle (similar to as Chrome and Firefox) is called [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) and it is the recommended option instead of the stable channel of Safari.
An excellent open source ad blocker for Safari that fully leverages content blockers is [dgraham/Ka-Block](https://github.com/dgraham/Ka-Block). See also [el1t/uBlock-Safari](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari/wiki/Disable-hyperlink-auditing-beacon) to disable hyperlink auditing beacons.
#### Other Web browsers
Many Chromium-derived browsers are not recommended. They are usually [closed source](http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=4176879&cid=44774943), [poorly maintained](https://plus.google.com/+JustinSchuh/posts/69qw9wZVH8z), [have bugs](https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=679), and make dubious claims to protect privacy. See [The Private Life of Chromium Browsers](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517132144/http://thesimplecomputer.info/the-private-life-of-chromium-browsers).
Other miscellaneous browsers, such as [Brave](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/issues/94), are not evaluated in this guide, so are neither recommended nor actively discouraged from use.
#### Web browsers and privacy
All Web Browsers retain certain information about our browsing habits. That information is used for a number of reasons. One of them is to improve the overall performance of the Web Browser. Most Web Browsers offer prediction services to resolve typos or URL redirections, store analytics data of browsing patterns, crash reports and black listing of known malicious servers. Those options can be turned on and off from each Web browser's settings panel.
Since Web browsers execute untrusted code from the server, it is important to understand what type of information can be accessed. The [Navigator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator) interface gives access to information about the Web Browser's user agent. Those include information such as the operating system, Web sites' permissions, and the device's battery level. For more information about security conscious browsing and what type of information is being "leaked" by your browser, see [HowTo: Privacy & Security Conscious Browsing](https://gist.github.com/atcuno/3425484ac5cce5298932), [browserleaks.com](https://www.browserleaks.com/) and [EFF Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).
To hinder third party trackers, it is recommended to **disable third-party cookies** in Web browser settings. A third party cookie is a cookie associated with a file requested by a different domain than the one the user is currently viewing. Most of the time third-party cookies are used to create browsing profiles by tracking a user's movement on the web. Disabling third-party cookies prevents HTTP responses and scripts from other domains from setting cookies. Moreover, cookies are removed from requests to domains that are not the document origin domain, so cookies are only sent to the current site that is being viewed.
Also be aware of [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC#Concerns), which may reveal your local or public (if connected to VPN) IP address(es). In Firefox and Chrome/Chromium this can be disabled with extensions such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Prevent-WebRTC-from-leaking-local-IP-address) and [rentamob/WebRTC-Leak-Prevent](https://github.com/rentamob/WebRTC-Leak-Prevent). Disabling WebRTC in Safari is only possible with a [system hack](https://github.com/JayBrown/Disable-and-toggle-WebRTC-in-macOS-Safari).
### Plugins
**Adobe Flash**, **Oracle Java**, **Adobe Reader**, **Microsoft Silverlight** (Netflix now works with [HTML5](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/23742)) and other plugins are [security risks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9901480) and should not be installed.
If they are necessary, only use them in a disposable virtual machine and subscribe to security announcements to make sure you're always patched.
See [Hacking Team Flash Zero-Day](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/hacking-team-flash-zero-day-integrated-into-exploit-kits/), [Java Trojan BackDoor.Flashback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_BackDoor.Flashback), [Acrobat Reader: Security Vulnerabilities](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-53/product_id-497/Adobe-Acrobat-Reader.html), and [Angling for Silverlight Exploits](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/angling-for-silverlight-exploits) for examples.
## Tor
Tor is an anonymizing proxy which can be used for browsing the Web.
Download Tor Browser from [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/download/).
Do **not** attempt to configure other browsers or applications to use Tor as you may make a mistake which will compromise anonymity.
Download both the `dmg` and `asc` signature files, then verify the disk image has been signed by Tor developers:
```console
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ file Tor*
TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg:     bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
TorBrowser-8.0.4-osx64_en-US.dmg.asc: PGP signature Signature (old)
$ gpg Tor*asc
[...]
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
