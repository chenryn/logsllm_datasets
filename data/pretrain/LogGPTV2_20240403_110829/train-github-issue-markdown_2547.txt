When trying to use object spread in function parameters with default parameter
present, transform-object-rest-spread doesn't apply.
### Input Code
Minimal test case in REPL . Transform doesn't apply after adding default
parameter.
    const b = ({ x, ...rest } = {}) => {};
### Babel Configuration (.babelrc, package.json, cli command)
### Expected Behavior
Transform applies also when default parameter is present.
### Current Behavior
Transform doesn't apply when default parameter is present.
### Possible Solution
### Context
I was trying to use object-rest-spread in node 6 without babel plugins for
natively supported ES6 features.
