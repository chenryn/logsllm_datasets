Based on the peer request arrival rate and the peer birth
rate we derived before (see Figure 10(b) and 10(c)), we
have p = 1 − λp
= 0.8548. This is very close to the
λq
value we got from Equation 4.12, 0.8551, meaning that
there are more than 85% peers joining multiple torrents.
Having characterized the torrent request pattern of
peers, ﬁnally we consider the distribution of the seed-
ing time and the sleeping time of peers. According to
our ﬂuid model, 1
γ represents the average seeding time.

Comparing Equation 4.25 with 3.6, we can see that
inter-torrent collaboration is much more effective than
decreasing the seed leaving rate γ for reducing down-
loading failure ratio. Decreasing seeds leaving rate has
polynomial effect, while inter-torrent collaboration has
exponential effect. For example, if the current download-
ing failure rate is 0.1, and seeds can be stimulated to stay
10 times longer (i.e., γ will decrease 10 times), then the
downloading failure rate will decrease 10 times to 0.01.
However, by inter-torrent collaboration, the downloading
failure ratio can be as low as 0.16 = 10−6. The reason is
that extending seed staying time only increases the ser-
vice time for peers that arrive close to the seed generation
time. With the passage of time, the peer arrival rate de-
creases exponentially, and ﬁnally the seed serving time
will not be long enough for newly arriving peers. On
the other hand, by exploiting inter-torrent collaboration,
peers that have downloaded the ﬁle may return multiple
times during a much longer period, and the downloading
failure ratio can be signiﬁcantly reduced to near zero.
5 A Discussion of Multi-Torrent Collabo-
ration Systems
In this section, we discuss the principle of a system de-
sign for multi-torrent collaboration. A more detailed dis-
cussion can be found in [13]. The system design and
implementation are ongoing.
5.1 Tracker Site Overlay
In BitTorrent systems, peers in different torrents cannot
collaborate because they cannot ﬁnd and communicate

with each other. The inter-torrent relation graph pre-
sented in Section 4.2 motivates us to organize the tracker
sites of different torrents into an overlay network to help
the peers sharing different ﬁles ﬁnd each other and coor-
dinate the collaboration among these peers. In such an
overlay network, each tracker site maintains a Neighbor-
Out Table and a Neighbor-In Table to record the relation-
ship with its neighboring torrents. The Neighbor-Out Ta-
ble records the torrents that its peers can provide service
to. The Neighbor-In Table records the torrents whose
peers can provide service to this torrent. When a peer q
joins a new torrent A, it uploads to its tracker site the in-
formation about from which torrents it had downloaded
ﬁles previously. Then A’s tracker site forwards this in-
formation to the tracker sites of those torrents where q
had downloaded ﬁles from. By doing so, the torrents that
are created independently by different content providers
are connected together to form a tracker site overlay, as
shown in Figure 15. Tracker site overlay also provides
a built-in mechanism to search content among multiple
torrents. Currently, BitTorrent users have to rely on Web-
based search engines to look for the content they want to
download.
5.2 Exchange Based Incentive for Multi-
torrent Collaboration
BitTorrent assumes each peer is selﬁsh, and exchanges
ﬁle chunks with those peers that provide it the best ser-
vice. The incentive mechanism in BitTorrent systems is
instant, because each peer must get corresponding ben-
eﬁt at once for the service it provides. For multi-torrent
collaboration, an exchange based mechanism can be ap-
plied for instant collaboration through the tracker site
overlay, which still follows the “tit-for-tat” idea.
First, peers in adjacent torrents in the overlay can ex-
change ﬁle chunks directly, such as torrent A, B in Fig-
ure 15. Second, if there exists a cycle among several
torrents, then peers in adjacent torrents can exchange
ﬁle chunks through the coordination of the tracker site
overlay, such as torrent B, C, D, E in Figure 15. More
speciﬁcally, when a peer q wants to get service from

peers in other torrents, it sends a request to its tracker
site with its list of downloaded ﬁles. Then the tracker
forwards its request to the trackers in its Neighbor-In Ta-
ble. These tracker sites then search their tables to ﬁnd
qualiﬁed peers, with whom this peer can exchange ﬁle
chunks to get service.
When a peer q wants to get service from peers in other
torrents and it has no service to exchange, it may join
these torrents temporarily and download some chunks
of the ﬁles, even if it does not want these ﬁles itself.
Through the coordination of corresponding tracker sites,
the peer can provide uploading service for these chunks
only, and attribute its service contribution to the peers
it wants to get service from, so that these peers can get
beneﬁt from the peers that q serves and offer q the ser-
vice it needs. Since a ﬁle chunk can be served to multiple
peers in the system, this method is very effective and the
overhead is trivial. Research [6, 9] presents similar idea
of using ﬁle exchange as an incentive for P2P content
sharing. Different from these studies, our system aims to
share bandwidth as well as content across multiple P2P
systems.
6 Conclusion
BitTorrent-like systems have become increasingly popu-
lar for object distribution and ﬁle sharing, and have con-
tributed to a large amount of trafﬁc on the Internet. In
this paper, we have performed extensive trace analysis
and modeling to study the behaviors of such systems.
We found that the existing BitTorrent system provides
poor service availability, ﬂuctuating downloading perfor-
mance, and unfair services to peers. Our model has re-
vealed that these problems are due to the exponentially
decreasing peer arrival rate and provides strong motiva-
tion for inter-torrent collaborations instead of simply giv-
ing seeds incentives to stay longer. We also discuss the
design of a new system where the tracker sites of dif-
ferent torrents are organized into an overlay to facilitate
inter-torrent collaboration with the help of an exchange
based incentive mechanism.
