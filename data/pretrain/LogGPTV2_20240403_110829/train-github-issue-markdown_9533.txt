Hello,

I am attempting to use the `addprocs` function in Julia to connect to remote workers on a Windows system. While the SSH connection is successful, Julia fails to execute commands on the remote machine.

I believe this issue is not related to the Julia installation on the remote machines, as I encountered the same error even when Julia was uninstalled on the remote side. The SSH connection itself seems to be functioning correctly, as it works in `cmd.exe`.

Here are the specific errors I encountered:

```
PI:EMAIL's password: [Here I input password]

Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
