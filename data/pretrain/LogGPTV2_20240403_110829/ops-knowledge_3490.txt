User: Please explain the basic concepts and principles of RESTful API, and its difference from SOAP API
Assistant: Basic concepts and principles of RESTful API: 1. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that includes a set of design principles and constraints for creating web-based applications. 2. RESTful API is an API design method that conforms to the REST architectural style and constraints. It is based on the HTTP protocol and uses HTTP verbs and resource paths for communication. 3. The basic principles of RESTful API include client-server separation, statelessness, cacheability, unified interface, layered system, coding on demand, etc. 4. RESTful API uses URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) to identify resources, and uses HTTP methods to represent operations, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Differences from SOAP API: 1. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is another Web service architecture style, which is based on XML and is more complex and bloated than RESTful API. 2. SOAP API uses XML format to transmit data, and provides rich protocol support and security features, such as WS-Security, WS-Addressing, WS-ReliableMessaging, etc. 3. SOAP API needs to rely on Web Service Description Language (WSDL) to describe the service interface and data format, and needs to generate client code for calling. 4. Compared with SOAP API, RESTful API is lighter, easier to use, more flexible and scalable, and more suitable for use in mobile and cloud applications.
