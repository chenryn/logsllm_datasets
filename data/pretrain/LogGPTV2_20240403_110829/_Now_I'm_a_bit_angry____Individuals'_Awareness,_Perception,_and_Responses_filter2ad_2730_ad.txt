prevalent was an increase in spam emails, text messages, etc.
Some participants reported scam phone calls, and others an-
ticipated identity theft as a potential impact (e.g., “I suppose
now that someone has all that information about me they
could impersonate me, open credit lines in my name, scam
my family and friends”). Participants who had experienced
adverse events described emotional stress and resulting behav-
ioral changes, such as avoiding phone calls due to frequent
scams or frequently checking emails for suspicious activities
after account compromises.
Notably, participants with and without experienced impacts
differed in assessing the impact’s severity. Most participants
who described anticipated impacts but had not experienced
them did not foresee real consequences (e.g., “the only things
that [would] really happen is . . . scammers . . . occasionally
attempt to access some of my older accounts that hold no
sensitive information”). This underlines that participants’ per-
ception of impacts after being affected by breaches largely
depends on individual circumstances. The ﬁnding also aligns
with prior work [99, 100] showing that people don’t adopt
secure behaviors until experiencing actual harms.
RQ2: What do participants perceive as the causes of be-
ing involved in data breaches and related impacts, and to
what extent do their perceptions align with reality? Our
results indicate that relatively few participants (42 out of 302,
14%) correctly attributed the cause of their victimhood to ex-
ternal factors such as the breached organization and hackers.
Instead, most participants referred to their insecure behaviors
related to email, passwords, etc., in explaining why their email
address appeared in a breach. Most participants reported little
to no experienced or anticipated impacts. When participants
named concrete consequences, they mostly referred to spam
and identity theft, though the perceived severity varied sub-
stantially.
5.3 RQ3: Awareness of Breaches
Among the 792 breach-speciﬁc responses, 590 (74%) re-
ported unawareness of being affected by the breach before
our study. Only 143 (18%) reported prior awareness, and

increase one’s vulnerability to breaches.
Only 42 (14%) of participants accurately attributed the
cause of being affected by a breach to external factors unre-
lated to their behaviors. 26 (9%) blamed it on lax security
measures by the breached organization (e.g., “these compa-
nies did not try hard enough to keep information private”).
16 (5%) blamed it on bad actors such as hackers and scam-
mers targeting the breached organization (e.g., “hackers are
devious devils and learn to adapt faster than organizations
can protect users”). Another 15 (5%) suspected their email
address was sold by the breached organization or a third party.
Nevertheless, nine participants incorrectly placed blame on
their email provider’s security (e.g., “I feel like Hotmail has
poor security and cannot block as many spam emails com-
pared to Gmail”).
Perceived reasons for not being affected by breaches.
Question 7 asked participants to speculate why their email
address was not involved in any data breach. Among the
136 provided responses, 78 (57%) mentioned cautious email
practices. Speciﬁcally, 31 (23%) reported using their email ad-
dress to sign up for trusted sites only, sometimes with careful
examination of the website (e.g., “I try as much as possible
to scrutinize websites before dropping any of my details”). 18
(13%) mentioned that their email address was relatively new
or did not get used much, which is indeed a relevant factor,
as shown by our regression results in Section 5.1. Ten further
mentioned limiting the email to speciﬁc purposes, such as
correspondence with friends and family members only.
Eight participants described using multiple email accounts
for different purposes, e.g., using one email address for cor-
respondence exclusively and another for account registration
on “low-value” sites. Such behavior would likely reduce the
likelihood of breaches involving high-value email addresses.
However, breaches involving low-value email addresses may
still have real impacts such as account hijacking.
21 (15%) participants cited their security practices as rea-
sons for not being affected. Nine participants mentioned their
password practices, such as using strong/unique passwords
and changing passwords regularly. Less frequently mentioned
were two-factor authentication, anti-virus, ﬁrewall, and VPN.
None of these behaviors are likely to prevent data breaches

the other 8% were unsure. Participants who were previously
aware of the breach mostly learned about it from the breached
organization (45, 31%) or third-party notiﬁcation services
(45, 31%). Less common sources included news media (17,
12%), credit/identity monitoring services (14, 10%), bank or
credit card companies (3, 2%), experiencing adverse events (3,
2%), and someone else (3, 2%). In nine instances, participants
could not remember how they learned about the breach.
Using a mixed-effect logistic regression to identify factors
that might impact awareness (excluding “unsure” responses),
we included the same email-related factors from Table 2 as
independent variables. Additionally, we included breach age
(i.e., the time lapse between a breach’s occurrence and the par-
ticipant taking our study), hypothesizing that participants are
more likely to recall and report awareness of recent breaches.
Results in Table 4 show a signiﬁcant intercept, indicating
that participants were more likely to be unaware of a breach
if they have a newer email address and the breach just oc-
curred (ORintercept =0.01, p<.001). Participants were also sig-
niﬁcantly more likely to be aware of a breach as the breach’s
age in years increased (ORbreach_age=1.22, p<.001). Older
participants were less likely to be aware of breaches than
young participants (OR18−34
55+ =0.39, p=.049), and men were
more likely to be aware of a breach than women in our sample
(ORwomen
men =2.09, p=.049), though p-values in both cases are
close to 0.05. These ﬁndings align with prior work in which
adopting protective behaviors differed by age [38] and gen-
der [79, 100]. Other demographic variables and email-related
factors are not signiﬁcantly correlated with prior awareness.
RQ3: What factors inﬂuence participants’ awareness of
data breaches that affected them? Participants were un-
aware of 74% of the breaches presented in our study, suggest-
ing that current methods of informing consumers about data
breaches might be ineffective. Prior awareness primarily came
from interactions with the breached company or third-party
notiﬁcation services. Notably, participants were signiﬁcantly
more likely to be aware of older breaches. A longer time-lapse
might provide participants with more opportunities to learn
about the breach, and once aware, participants’ memory of
the breach does not seem to fade away.
5.4 RQ4: Emotional Response and Concerns
towards Breaches
Participants indicated their concern using a 5-point Likert item
for each shown breach (Question 15) and for each data type
leaked in a breach (Question 17). We also asked participants
to describe their feelings regarding the breach (Question 14,
open-ended).
Quantitative ratings of concern level. Among 792 breach-
speciﬁc responses, the median concern level regarding the
breach was “somewhat concerned.” Less than half reported
either no concern (151, 19%) or being very/extremely con-
cerned (197, 25% combined). Figure 4 shows concern levels
for commonly leaked data types. Participants were most con-
cerned about leaks of physical address (52% very/extremely),
passwords (47% very/extremely), and phone number (42%
very/extremely). Other leaked data types that participants felt
less concerned about were employer information (38% not at
all), social media proﬁle (42% not at all), job title (46% not
at all), and gender (65% not at all).
We sought to identify factors that might impact concern
level through a mixed-effect linear regression on overall con-
cern Likert responses. We included email address-related fac-
tors and prior awareness as independent variables, hypothe-
sizing that participants would be more concerned about fre-
quently used email addresses or if they had not been aware
of a breach. We also included the number of breached data
types and the breach status of data types for which more than
50% of responses were “somewhat concerned” or above in
Figure 4, namely password, physical address, phone number,
date of birth, IP address, and name.7 We hypothesized that
as the amount or sensitivity of leaked data types increases,
the concern level would increase. Additionally, we included
7Email address was not included because it was exposed in all breaches
in our sample, making no positive vs. negative cases.

about recent breaches.
The regression results do not reveal any signiﬁcant

factors impacting overall concern except
(bintercept =2.52, SE=.31, p<.001), indicating that partici-
pants likely default to between “slightly concerned” and
“somewhat concerned.” The model’s f 2 = 0.03 indicates a
small effect size. The absence of inﬂuential factors on con-
cern may be due to data types known to trigger more concerns,
such as ﬁnancial information and social security numbers, be-
ing underrepresented in our sample’s breaches (see Figure 2).
Even relatively sensitive data types in our sample still had a
fair number of “not at all/slightly concerned” responses.
Various emotions in qualitative responses. Figure 5
shows the wide range of emotions reﬂected in participants’
open-ended responses about their feelings after learning of
a breach affecting them. In 237 (30%) cases, participants
reported feeling upset (including annoyed, frustrated, mad,
and angry), mostly toward the breached organization. The
upset came from not having been properly informed (e.g., “I
was very disappointed . . . they hid the fact that there was a
data breach from everyone for three months”), the organi-
zation’s poor security measures (e.g., “don’t run an entirely
online business if you cant do basic security”), or violation
of consumers’ trust (e.g., “I joined this site to read a story
my granddaughter had written and thought it was completely
safe”). These emotions align with the “risk as feelings” theory,
which highlights that people experience dread and outrage in
comprehending risks [80], and that such affective responses
greatly inﬂuence their subsequent decision-making, some-
times overriding cognitive assessments [48].
Mirroring the Likert responses, feeling unconcerned about
a breach was common (185, 23%). Many participants believed
that the exposed data was not sensitive (e.g., “I had only used
the free version of that site, so I had not entered any payment

about a breach (n = 792); red bars indicate negative feelings,

information”). Others were unconcerned because they rarely
interacted with nor knew the breached organization (e.g., “I
don’t even know what this site is, so I don’t think that them
having my info . . . is a huge deal”). Some were unconcerned
due to conﬁdence in their security habits, including regularly
changing passwords (25), avoiding password reuse (10), and
enabling 2FA (4). A few participants were unconcerned due
to a lack of experienced impacts (e.g., “I’m not especially
worried because I haven’t detected any suspicious activity”)
or optimism bias (e.g., “I feel like a drop in the bucket since
there were 711 million emails affected”).
104 (13%) responses reported feeling unsurprised whereas
66 (8%) reported feeling surprised. Unsurprised participants
explained that they never trusted the breached organization or
already knew about the breach. Conversely, surprised partici-
pants stated that they had never used the breached organiza-
tion’s service or trusted the organization.
In another 75 (9%) cases, participants expressed confusion
due to unfamiliarity with the breached organization or not
remembering having an account. Other prominent emotions
included fatigued (43, 5%), violated (40, 5%), indifferent (33,
4%), scared (29, 4%), unsafe (18, 2%), relieved (18, 2%), or
curious about why the breach happened (13, 2%). Those who
expressed fatigue stressed that breaches were inevitable (e.g.,
“It’s the internet and things WILL be leaked somehow, either
by hackers or by incompetence at the company that is hold-
ing your information anyhow”). This attitude is akin to the
“digital resignation” phenomenon [20]: many people’s inac-
tion in the face of privacy infringements are not necessarily
because they do not care, but because they are resigned and
convinced that surveillance is inescapable. Notably, neutral
emotions, like curiosity, or positive emotions, like relief, were
rare. Participants were relieved when sensitive data like ﬁ-
nancial information was not involved or that they were now
aware of the breach and could take proper action.
