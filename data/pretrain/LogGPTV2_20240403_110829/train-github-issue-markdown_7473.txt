I am incorrectly getting the following error, **"This can only be used with
ES6. Make sure to have a jsconfig.json-file which sets the target to ES6"**.
Furthermore, I think I may have stumbled upon a weird case where if the start
of the file name is "temp" as in "temp.js", "temporary.js", or "temp123.js" it
will cause this error.
To reproduce:  
Create a file called temp.js with some ES6 code, such as:
    let x = 10
The above error is now showing. To fix it, create the jsconfig.json file which
sets the target to ES6:
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "target": "ES6"
        }
    }
The error is still showing, now incorrectly.
If I rename "temp.js" to "test.js" (or anything that doesn't start with
'temp') the error goes away. Or, if I create a files array in jsconfig.json
which lists "temp.js", the error goes away:
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "target": "ES6"
        },
        "files": [
            "temp.js"
        ]
    }
I don't want to have to do this for every file in my project.
I'm running on Windows 7, 64-bit.
Thanks
