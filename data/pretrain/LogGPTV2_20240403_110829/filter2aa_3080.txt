### Dirty Little Secrets of Information Security: Why We Might Not Be Doing as Well as You Would Hope
**Speaker: Bruce Potter (PI:EMAIL)**

#### 1. Don’t Believe Anything I Say
- **George Bernard Shaw**: "Every person who has mastered a profession is a skeptic concerning it."
- **Robert Lindner**: "Authority has every reason to fear the skeptic, for authority can rarely survive in the face of doubt."
- **Security Philosophy**: Security is about not trusting what you hear, see, or receive. This principle applies equally in the physical and digital worlds.

**Professional Background:**
- **Day Job**: Senior Associate at Booz Allen Hamilton, focusing on wireless security, application assurance, and information security strategy.
- **Night Job**: Founder of The Shmoo Group.

#### 2. What’s Happening Here?
- **Objective**: To highlight some of the major issues (800-pound gorillas) in the security industry.
- **Industry Issues**: These issues are often addressed in non-productive ways. This talk aims to address them head-on and provide actionable insights.
- **Note**: Much of this presentation is based on personal opinions and loose research. Disagreements and constructive criticism are welcome.

#### 4. The Evolution of the Security Community
- **1960s**: Small, academic groups of computer scientists.
- **1970s**: Introduction of Telnet, trusted systems research, and blueboxing.
- **1980s**: BBSs, viruses, trojans, and the hacker underground.
- **1990s**: Firewalls, AV, IDS, and the rise of the internet.
- **2000s**: Social networking, strong cryptography, and profit-driven hacking.

**Key Milestones**:
- **Unix Development**
- **ARPANet Starts**
- **BBS Popularity**
- **PC Birth**
- **Morris Worm**
- **Mosaic to Netscape**
- **DefCon I**
- **CodeRed, Slammer**

#### 5. Secret #1 - Defense in Depth is Dead
- **Early Computing**: Bad code with no type safety, fault isolation, error handling, or access control.
- **Networking Era**: ARPANet, Internet, and firewalls.
- **Modern Era**: Global networks, IDS, AV, anti-spam, multifactor authentication, and XML firewalls.
- **Current State**: Complex systems with millions of lines of code, but little improvement in security management tools.
- **Solution**: Focus on fixing the code through type safety, secure coding education, and trusted computing.

#### 6. Secret #2 - Professionalizing the Workforce
- **Education Gap**: Few people have degrees in security. Most security programs are at the graduate level and focus on information assurance.
- **Self-Education**: Most security professionals learn through self-education, on-the-job training, and conferences.
- **Industry Challenge**: How do we codify our knowledge and train the next generation of security professionals?

**Workforce Realities**:
- **Training Limitations**: It's impractical to train everyone, including those with security titles.
- **Single Point of Failure**: One untrained person can compromise the entire system.
- **Social Engineering**: A single successful social engineering attack can cause significant damage.
- **User-Friendly Tools**: Users need security tools that don't require extensive education.

#### 7. Secret #3 - Security Vendors vs. IT
- **Market Growth**: The network security market is estimated to be $7 billion in a few years.
- **Product Focus**: Most products focus on adding layers of protection rather than securing the foundation.
- **Case Study**: Microsoft's driver signing requirements for 64-bit OS were opposed by security vendors, leading to a compromise that weakened the security mechanism.

**Future Landscape**:
- **Past Assumption**: Third-party security products were necessary due to insecure software.
- **Future Concerns**: Big software companies are improving their security, raising questions about the future of third-party security products.

#### 8. Secret #4 - Full Disclosure is Dead
- **Historical Context**: Public discussions of security issues have grown from niche forums to mainstream media.
- **Community Growth**: A community developed around vulnerability research and responsible disclosure.
- **Current Trends**: Decreased exploit development timeframes and mercenary exploit development.
- **Patch Tuesday**: Both attackers and defenders benefit from regular patch releases.
- **Secondary Market**: Companies offer money for exclusive rights to exploits, creating a secondary market for vulnerability information.

**Impact**:
- **Disclosure Dilemma**: The decision now is whether to disclose or profit from vulnerabilities.
- **End-User Impact**: This secondary market may potentially harm end users.
- **Goal**: Make live systems more resilient to attacks.

---

#### 9. Where Does That Leave Us?
- **Recognize Changes**: The security landscape has evolved, and we need to adapt.
- **Vendor Pressure**: Push vendors to create products that secure the foundation, not just add more layers.
- **Formal Knowledge**: Develop a formal body of knowledge for information security and hold each other accountable.

#### 10. ShmooCons Past and Future
- **ShmooCon 3**: Successful event with 1000 attendees, raised money for EFF and awareness for OLPC.
- **ShmooCon 4**: Planning underway for February 15-17, 2008, at the Wardman Park Marriott, DC.
- **Future Announcements**: Expect interesting Shmoo announcements in the coming months.
