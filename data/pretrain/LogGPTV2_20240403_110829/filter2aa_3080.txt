concerning it.” - George Bernard Shaw
• “Authority has every reason to fear the skeptic, for authority 
can rarely survive in the face of doubt” - Robert Lindner

What’s happening here?
• The goal of this talk is to call out some of the 800lbs 
gorillas in the room
• The security industry is riddled with them, and 
sometimes they’re called out in non-productive ways
• I’d like to address them head on... and actually do 
something useful with our jobs
• NOTE: Much of what is in this presentation you will 
probably disagree with.  Also, much of what is in this 
presentation is my opinion and analysis based on what 
can loosely be called “research.”  Feel free to throw 
stones.

Secret #1 - Defense in Depth is Dead
• In the beginning, there was bad 
code
• And there was much rejoicing, 
because at least we had 
computers that did stuff for us
• No type safety
• No fault isolation
• No error handling
• No assurance in the code
• No real access control
• BUT... at least it was doing our 
bidding
TUBES!
10
Defense in Depth is Dead
• Over time, we began to network 
systems together
• ARPANet, then the Internet
• Firewalls popped up everywhere
• TIS released its source
• Stateful Firewalls
• But still, we had bad code... 
even more of it than before
• “A ﬁrewall is a network response 
to a software engineering problem” 
- Steve Bellovin
• The dawn of the ﬁrewall age was 
the beginning of “defense in depth”

IDS
Anti 
Virus
Defense in Depth is Dead
• Then networks became 
global and attacks started to 
come in all shapes and sizes
• So we deployed IDS’s, AV, 
and anti-spam to ﬁnd the 
bad guys
• And we deployed 
multifactor auth to keep 
the bad guys out
• And we spent WAY too 
much time managing this 
mess
• But still we had bad code
12
Defense in Depth is Dead
•
Now, we’re moving towards 
service based architectures where 
the “network is the computer” and 
SOA rules all
•
So we deploy XML ﬁrewalls to 
protect our applications
•
And we use Single Sign On so 
our users aren’t hassled
•
But still we have bad code
•
All this time, systems have become 
incredibly complicated
•
Millions and millions of lines of 
code were required for me to type 
this Power Point slide
•
Billions of lines of code deﬁne 
most enterprises
XML
Firewall
13
Defense in Depth is Dead
• While KLOC/enterprise has gone through the roof, 
have we seen a similar increase in power of our security 
management and operations tools?  Have we seen more 
security staff applied to the problem?
• An idea: Fix the Damn Code!
• Type safety
• Secure coding taught to ALL CS majors
• Trusted computing
• AT LEAST, we need better software controls on our 
systems, not better ﬁrewalls
14
Secret #2 - We are over a decade away from 
professionalizing the workforce 
•
How many people have a degree in anything security related?
•
Most security programs geared towards graduate level students, 
not the masses of undergrads…
•
And most of those are “Information Assurance”, not secure 
coding, not network security, not security operations
•
How many people here even have graduate degrees?
•
The VAST majority of the security workforce has learned how to 
do their job through self-education, OJT, and (frankly) security 
conferences and training
•
Name one other USD10Billion industry where the majority of 
the workforce is basically “untrained” in the eyes of the public 
and with a zero-level barrier to entry
•
So the question remains: How do we codify our knowledge and 
instruct the next generation of mini-Dans, mini-Halvar’s, and mini-
DT’s?
15
Looking at the current workforce, we have to 
realize we can’t train everyone
• Software developers are the smartest they’ll ever be 
the day they graduate from college
• No offense intended…
• Security is everyone’s problem, right?
• Well, you can’t train even the people with security in 
their title, let alone “everyone”
• A single break in the wall usually compromises the 
entire system...  s/a single untrained person/
• One good work of social engineering can cause huge 
problems
• Users need tools that don’t require education to be 
used securely
16
Secret #3 - Many of the security product 
vendors are about to be at odds 
with the rest of IT
• This defense in depth thing led to an incredible industry 
of security products
• It is estimated the network security market alone will 
be $7bln in a year or two
• Firewalls, IDS, log analysis, AAA services, etc are a 
core part of any IT budget
• Very few products are actually geared towards making 
the foundation more secure
• Software scanners such as those created by Ounce 
Labs, Fortify, and Aspect
• HSM’s, smart cards, and other hardware
17
Secret #3 - At odds
•
A recent case study:
•
Microsoft hears the message that consumers want a more 
secure operating system
•
Microsoft knows that the 64-bit version of the OS is the future 
and where enterprise demand will be
•
Microsoft integrates driver signing requirements to prevent 
malicious code from hooking the kernel
•
Security vendors complain that Microsoft is exerting too much 
control of the kernel and stopping their products from working 
right
•
Some security vendors (Authentium for instance) ﬁnd ways to 
bypass security
•
Microsoft bends and says they’ll create API’s to allowed some 
unsigned driver interaction, defeating the purpose of the 
security mechanism
18
Secret #3 - At odds
• So, the landscape has shifted
• The past:  We presumed that the software in our systems 
was so insecure that we had to buy 3rd party security 
products
• A corollary: The quality of code in the 3rd party 
products was worthy of the trust we placed in them
• The future: Software security is a real concern (largely for 
compliance and legal issues, but whatever) and may big 
software shops are starting to ﬁgure this out
• So, what does the future of these 3rd party security 
products look like?
19
Secret the Last - Full Disclosure is Dead
• Or at the very least, it’s hurt very bad
• There is tons of money to be had in selling bugs
• Only in the last 15 years has public discussions of 
Information Security issues come into vogue
• From obscure geeky bulletin boards to the front page of 
the NY Times…
• Because of the specialized knowledge required, and the lack 
of a formal body of knowledge, a community has grown
• Information on vulnerability research methods, speciﬁc 
vulnerability info and live exploits were publicly discussed
• The idea of “responsible disclosure” was born (and 
debated at length)
• But things have changed…
20
Decreased exploit development timeframes and 
mercenary exploit dev are changing the rules 
•
Patches have two major uses
•
Secure a system that has a known vulnerability
•
Determine what vulnerability was patched in order to develop an exploit
•
In the last several years, there has been an incredible decrease in the amount 
of time between patch release and creation of a successful exploit
•
Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday has been great for both attackers and defenders 
alike
•
The moral? Patch disclosure is essentially the same as vulnerability 
disclosure
•
Many security companies now offer money in exchange for exclusive rights to 
exploits from mercenary exploit developers
•
Tipping Point’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)
•
iDefense’s Vulnerability Contributor Program (VCP)
•
Many private transactions
•
These programs have “rewards” programs, as well as other incentives…
21
This has TOTALLY changed the “full 
disclosure” argument
• Changes the foundational argument
• Previously: What disclosure method should I employ?
• Now: Should I disclose or should I proﬁt?
• NOTE: these options may not be mutually 
exclusive, but it’s hard to verify its not
• Maybe, just maybe, we’ve lost track of what we’re trying 
to get done
• Ultimately, we’re trying to make live systems more 
resilient to attack
• By creating a secondary market for vulnerability info, 
we’re proﬁting at (potentially) the expense of the end 
user
22
So... where does that leave us?
• The landscape has changed, and we need to recognize it
• We need to push vendors to make products that 
actually create a secure foundation, not just layer on 
more protections that need to be managed
• We need to create a more formal body of knowledge 
for information security... and we need to hold each 
other accountable
• Now, for some announcements
23
ShmooCons Past and Future
• ShmooCon 3 was a great success
• 30 folks helped setup the network via ShmooCon Labs
• 1000 people showed up... 1000 people left (success!)
• Raised money for EFF, raised awareness for OLPC
• ShmooCon 4 planning is ongoing
• Likely dates: Feb 15-17, 2008
• Likely location: Same.  Wardman Park Marriott, DC
• Likely will continue to be a blast
• Expect some interesting Shmoo announcements in the 
coming months
