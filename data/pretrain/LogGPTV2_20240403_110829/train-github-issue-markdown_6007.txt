I'm not exactly sure what it's supposed to do, but it seems wrong:
    #![feature(macro_rules)]
    macro_rules! some_stmts(
        ({ $($s:stmt)* }) => ($($s)*)
    )
    fn main() {
        some_stmts!({
            //let a = 5;
            type a = int;
        })
    }
As is, we get:
    stmts.rs:10:5: 10:6 error: local ambiguity: multiple parsing options: built-in NTs stmt ('s') or 1 other options.
    stmts.rs:10     })
even though there is no way `}` could start a statement. With the `let`
instead, it's
    stmts.rs:8:18: 8:19 error: unexpected token: `;`
    stmts.rs:8         let a = 5;
which doesn't seem to make sense either.
