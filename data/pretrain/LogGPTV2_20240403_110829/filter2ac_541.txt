**ATT&CK ID:** M1036  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Account Use Policies

Implement account lockout policies to prevent passwords from being guessed through repeated failed login attempts. However, overly strict policies may lead to a denial of service condition, as multiple accounts could be locked out during a brute force attack, rendering the environment unusable. To mitigate this risk, consider using conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from IP addresses outside of the defined organizational range.
