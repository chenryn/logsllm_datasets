Abstract
Safety-critical distributed control systems must support
periodic and aperiodic functions on common hardware (e.g.
sending messages on a common data bus). Scheduling tech-
niques that produce a timeline with predeﬁned blocks for
periodic functions are used to guarantee deadlines for criti-
cal closed loop periodic control functions (i.e. sensor read,
control, actuator write). Aperiodic processing occurs in pe-
riodic timeline gaps. We develop a technique for binning
aperiodic latency sample data using a novel data repre-
sentation called latency band graphs. A ﬂuid ﬂow analy-
sis produces a small, ﬁxed size set of automatically gener-
ated bins dependent only on the timeline deﬁned by periodic
trafﬁc. The compact number of bins yeilds a parameterized
latency representation suitable for real-time estimation and
goodness-of-ﬁt tests. Simulation results show good latency
estimates under a broad range of conditions.
1. Problem Description/Motivation
Distributed control systems must support both critical
time-triggered periodic functions and (non-critical) event-
triggered aperiodic functions on common hardware. Send-
ing messages on a common data bus, scheduling tasks on
a common processor, and scheduling applications on stat-
ically deﬁned time partitions are canonical examples. To
ensure guaranteed latencies (i.e. time in queue plus service)
for closed loop periodic control functions (i.e. sensor read,
control, actuator write), scheduling techniques that produce
a ﬁxed timeline with predeﬁned blocks of time reserved for
periodic functions are used. Aperiodic processing occurs in
the sequence of timeline gaps. See Figure 1. Avionics and
automotive systems exemplify the use of predeﬁned time-
lines for ensuring stringent dependendability requirements
of distributed closed-loop feedback control systems.
Tractible mathematical approximations for aperiodic la-
tency distributions are rare, so they must be estimated us-
ing empirical (typically simulation) data. We present a new

technique for binning aperiodic latency sample data. Our
technique is based on a novel data representation called la-
tency band graphs, to which we apply a ﬂuid ﬂow analysis,
leading to a small, ﬁxed set of automatically generated bins
that depends only on the periodic trafﬁc. The small and
deterministic number of bins yields a compact latency rep-
resentation suitable for use in real-time on actual data, and
provides good estimates under a broad range of conditions.
Patterns in the size and spacing of timeline gaps can sig-
niﬁcantly effect the shape of the latency distribution. Fig-
ure 2 shows two latency distributions. The x-axis is time,
and the y-axis is the probability that the latency R is less
than a time x. The dark squiggly dotted line is the data and
the faint dotted line is our proposed approximation. The
dot-dash lines are conﬁdence bands for the true latency dis-
tribution. (Section 3.3 details these graphs.) In both ﬁgures,
the periodic and aperiodic utilizations are 75% and 10%,
respectively. In both ﬁgures, the average aperiodic message
transmission (i.e. service) time is one millisecond. In the
top ﬁgure, periodic processing consumes the ﬁrst six of ev-
ery eight milliseconds. In the bottom, the ﬁrst 192 out of
every 256 milliseconds is reserved for periodic processing.
Since the distributions differ noticably, latencies depend on

If in Equation 1,  = 0.07 and k = 500, then δ = 0.0149, so
the probability the true latency falls inside a band of radius
0.07 about the observed empirical distribution function is at
least 0.985.
In many embedded control systems with both peri-
odic control tasks (messages) and aperiodic task (message)
streams, it is common to regulate the amount of available
bandwidth for aperiodic trafﬁc so that guarantees of a min-
imum amount of CPU cycles (bus capacity) can be made
within a certain time frame. A minimum positive aperiodic
interarrival time is often assumed. The sporadic server al-
gorithm [9] and bus scheduling in WorldFIP networks [10]
incorporate these assumptions, for example. With trafﬁc
shaping assumptions or regulation of aperiodic trafﬁc ﬂow
such as enforced minimum interarrival times, worst case

analyses are possible [5, 12]. Instead, we focus on actual
performance distributions combined with the possibility of
real-time model adaptation in response to observed changes
in system behavior, rather than worst case aperiodic perfor-
mance guarantees. Without bounded trafﬁc assumptions or
regulation, guarantees can only be probabilistic.
When viewing a bus as a server and aperiodic tasks’
messages as arriving jobs, results from classical queueing
theory become candidates for analytic/numeric estimation
techniques. The block-gap distribution plays a signﬁcant
role in how well approximating solutions ﬁt. Section 3.2
gives classical heavy trafﬁc results (and their relationship to
ﬂuid ﬂows), which work well when aperiodic queue lengths
are so long that aperiodic transmission capacity appears
“proportionally shared” (between the trafﬁc classes).
3. Deﬁnitions
Terminology is ﬁrst deﬁned. The experiments are de-
ﬁned. A reference model is introduced as a basis for com-
paring the general shapes of different latency distributions.
Some classical heavy trafﬁc related work is cited. Latency
band and distribution graphs are described.
3.1. Notation
Table 1 summarizes all notation to be be used.
The m periodic message durations have blocking times
m1, m2, ..., mm. In Figure 1, the ith blocking interval mi
begins at time bi relative to frame start where b1 = 0 and
bm+1 = H. The hyperperiod (or frame) H is the small-
est time it takes for the periodic message transmission cy-
cle to repeat. Periodic blocking (busy) intervals alternate

gi and has duration bi+1 − gi. A periodic busy-idle inter-
val vector BI is deﬁned by the transition points between
busy intervals and gaps. In Figure 1, for example, the time-
line is BI = [b1 = 0, g1, b2, g2, ..., bm, gm, bm+1 = H].
Aperiodic messages are transmitted in ﬁfo (ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out)
order and have no deadlines. Denote the nth aperiodic mes-
sage by an, with arrival time αn and transmission duration
xn. A gap is (partially) empty only if there is no waiting
aperiodic message ready to be sent. Incomplete aperiodic
transmissions resume transmission at the next available gap
(assumed in the model without any preemption overhead).

system utilization is ρ = ρ1 + ρ2 < 1. The maximum delay
beyond which there is no utility is denoted by dmax. It can
be arbitrarily large and is system dependent.
