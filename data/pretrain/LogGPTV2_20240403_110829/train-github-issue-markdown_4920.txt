**I've deactivated the soft tab option in the preferences.**  
Using tabulators does not align the text correctly. Looks like the offset is
not correct.
**I tried this example text:**
    asdasd  asd
    asdas   asd

If someone could give me a hint, where in the code I could look for this Issue
- I could try to fix it.
