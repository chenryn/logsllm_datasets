## Agenda
1. **Threat Intel 102: Capability and Intent**
   - What are they capable of doing?
   - What are their intentions?

2. **Threat Intel 102: Categorization**
   - Signatures vs Indicators
   - Data vs Intelligence
   - Tactical vs Strategic
   - Atomic vs Composite

3. **Threat Intel 102: Pyramid of Pain**
   - "Simple" and "easy" aren't always synonymous (David Bianco - Pyramid of Pain)
   - IP Addresses:
     - Similar value to hostnames (APT vs DGA)
     - Finite resource (until IPv6)
     - Managed/controlled by organizations
     - Difficulty, economic incentives, and implied "cost"
     - Recyclable

4. **Introducing TIQTEST**
   - Available as R functions: https://github.com/mlsecproject/aqctest
   - Tools that implement these tests
   - Sample data + R Markdown file
   - An excuse to learn a statistical language!

5. **Data Sources and Preparation**
   - Types of data: Extracting raw information from indicator feeds
   - Feeds selected: Separated into "inbound" and "outbound"
   - Data preparation and cleansing:
     - Convert hostname data to IP addresses
     - Remove non-public IPs (RFC1918)
     - Add AS number, AS name, country, and reverse DNS (rhost)
     - Focus on ASNs and Geolocation
     - No maps used in this study

6. **Testing the Data**
   - Metrics:
     - **Novelty**: How often do they update themselves?
     - **Overlap**: How do they compare to what you already have?
     - **Population**: What is in them anyway? (Could mean the entire world or your specific environment)
   - Statistical inference-based comparison models:
     - Exact binomial tests
     - Chi-squared proportion tests
   - Estimating measures of error with confidence intervals and p-values

7. **Hacker Spirit Animal™ Guide**
   - US: Eagle
   - CA: Moose
   - FR: Frog
   - GB: Bulldog
   - AU: Koala
   - BR: Capybara/Toucan
   - Texas: Armadillo
   - Disclaimer: We do not endorse geolocation-based attribution

8. **Trend Comparison**

9. **Introducing COMBINE**
   - Harvesting and normalizing threat data
   - Components:
     1. **Reaper**: Gathers threat data directly from feeds
     2. **Thresher**: Normalizes data into a simple model
     3. **Winnower**: Optionally performs basic validation or enrichment
     4. **Baler**: Transforms data into CybOX, CSV, JSON, and CIM (only CSV and JSON currently functional)
   - Enrichments: AS, geolocation, DNS resolutions (Farsight DNSDB)
   - Released as GPL v3 by MLSec Project
   - Looking for participants and data sharing agreements

10. **Takeaways**
    - Analyze your data
    - Extract value from it
    - Try before you buy; different test results mean different things to different organizations
    - Use the tools and suggest new tests
    - Share data with us; we take good care of it
