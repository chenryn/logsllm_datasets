International Law
• Currently ill-suited for cybercrime
• Internet a borderless medium
– Cannot apply nation-state style borders
• Definitions of cybercrime vary
– Likewise the punishments 
• Extradition of criminals
– Difficult on many levels
• Bounty hunting: Microsoft
• Tapping fan-base: Half-Life 2
Extra-Territoriality and 
Investigations 
• Impossible to examine all foreign packets
• High level of anonymity on the Web
• Scarcity of good log data (and expertise)
• Digital information can be destroyed quickly
• Evidence should be secured ASAP
• Cultural, linguistic, and political barriers
• Traceback involves time lags
The FBI Sting
• 2000: FBI learns hackers cracking banks, ISPs, 
and other firms in U.S. 
• Activity traced to Russia
• Failed to acquire Russian assistance
• Took unilateral action with U.S. search warrant
• Invited two Russians to Seattle for “interviews”
• Sniffed keystrokes for usernames/passwords 
• FBI officials never left their offices in U.S. 
• First FBI extra-territorial seizure
Remote Search and Seizure
• Inconsistent with international law?
• Reconnaissance often uses universal 
media for observation in other countries
– Binoculars, telescopes, surveillance aircraft, 
commercial satellites
– personal interviews, mass media
• Network reconnaissance any different?
– No physical entry
• Invasion or picture taking?
European Cybercrime Convention
• Global cybercrime task force like Interpol?
• Opposition concerns:
– Civil liberties (abuse of data sharing)
– Poor relations between certain countries
– Big obligations on ISPs
– No cross-border searches, even in hot pursuit
– Need to consult with local officials
– Universal consent (safe havens)
International Law: The Future
• Technological capability
• Legal authority
– Territorial Sovereignty
• Willingness to Cooperate
– Including ability: language, cultural 
political barriers
Voluntary participants need three things:
• PRC CERT: One person, and 
he only speaks Chinese?!?
