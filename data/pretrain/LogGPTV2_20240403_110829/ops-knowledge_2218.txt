User: Please provide a system backup and recovery plan. The system includes 5 servers, including one master server and four slave servers, and the data volume is about 2TB.
Assistant: Backup scheme: 1. Regular full backup: Full backup is performed once a week. The backup data is stored on the local disk and transmitted to the backup server through the network. The backup process uses the rsync command that comes with Linux. 2. Incremental backup: Daily incremental backup of data, the backup data is also stored on the local disk, and transmitted to the backup server through the network, the incremental backup uses the rsync command. Recovery plan: 1. Fault recovery: When a server fails, the degree of failure should be judged first, and the hardware should be modified or replaced as needed. If the hardware is not damaged, simply reinstall the operating system and applications. 2. Data recovery: Import the backup data to the failed server through the backup server for data recovery, and use the rsync command to restore the updated data. If the data cannot be recovered from the backup server, third-party data recovery software can be used. Note: 1. Backup data should be stored in different locations (such as cloud storage) to ensure data security. 2. Regularly check whether the backup data can be successfully restored to prevent backup data from being damaged or lost. 3. The storage period of the backup data can be adjusted according to the actual situation.
