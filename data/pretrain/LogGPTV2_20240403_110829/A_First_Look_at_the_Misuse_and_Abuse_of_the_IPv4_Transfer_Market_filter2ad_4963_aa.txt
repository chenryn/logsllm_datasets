## Abstract
The depletion of unallocated IPv4 addresses and the slow adoption of IPv6 have led to the emergence of the IPv4 transfer market, where organizations trade allocated IPv4 prefixes. Despite policies established by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) to regulate this market, IPv4 transfers present opportunities for malicious networks, such as spammers and bulletproof Autonomous Systems (ASes), to bypass reputational penalties by obtaining "clean" IPv4 address space or offloading blacklisted addresses. Additionally, IP transfers create a window of uncertainty regarding the legitimate ownership of prefixes, leading to inconsistencies in WHOIS records and routing advertisements. This paper provides the first detailed study of how transferred IPv4 prefixes are misused in the wild, using a combination of longitudinal IP blacklists, honeypot data, and AS reputation lists. Our findings indicate that transferred IPv4 address blocks are used by malicious networks to host botnets and fraudulent sites at significantly higher rates compared to non-transferred addresses. The timing of these attacks suggests efforts to evade filtering mechanisms.

## 1 Introduction
The depletion of unallocated IPv4 addresses, combined with the slow transition to IPv6, has led to the emergence of a secondary market for the transfer of IPv4 addresses. However, this market has been poorly regulated due to the lack of widely adopted IP prefix ownership authentication mechanisms, inconsistent contractual requirements between legacy and allocated address space, and policy incongruences among RIRs. As a result, IPv4 transfers have become targets of fraud and abuse by malefactors who try to bypass legal IP ownership processes. RIRs have responded by establishing policy frameworks to safeguard the accuracy of registered IP blocks and provide oversight and transparency on how organizations trade IPv4 address blocks. However, the effectiveness of these policies in preventing abuse remains unclear. These policies focus primarily on ownership and utilization issues but do not address the malicious use of transferred space, such as by bulletproof hosters seeking clean address space for botnets and fraudulent sites. Discussions in mailing lists and message boards indicate that the operational community is concerned about these risks but faces significant difficulties when purchasing or selling address space.

In this paper, we aim to shed light on the misuse and abuse of the IPv4 transfer market. We combine a large collection of longitudinal control-plane and data-plane data to analyze and verify the information reported by RIRs on IP transfers. Our findings show that the reported transfer dates and recipient organizations do not reflect the state of WHOIS registries and BGP routing for more than 65% of the transferred prefixes. Additionally, 6% of the prefixes covered by Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) have an inconsistent origin ASN. We then compile and analyze a large-scale dataset of malicious activities covering over a decade, derived from IP traffic traces and control-plane paths, including IP blacklists, honeypots, prefix hijacking detection, and AS reputation mechanisms. Our results reveal that transferred IP space is 4x to 25x more likely to be blacklisted, depending on the type of malicious activity. The majority of transferred IPs are blacklisted after the transfer date, even when the transferred address space was deployed and visible to IP scans at least a month before the transfer. The disproportionate representation of transferred prefixes in blacklists persists even when filtering out address space used by well-known legitimate networks, such as cloud platforms (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud). Finally, we provide evidence that ASes detected as serial BGP hijackers or bulletproof hosters are over-represented in the IPv4 market and exhibit suspicious patterns of transactions as both buyers and sellers. These results offer new insights into agile blacklist evasion techniques and can inform the development of more timely and accurate blacklisting mechanisms. Additionally, our work can inform debates on developing and evaluating RIR policies on IP transfers to improve the hygiene of the ecosystem.

## 2 Background and Related Work

### 2.1 IP Transfer Market
Today, the available IPv4 address space of all RIRs except AFRINIC has been depleted. Despite increasing pressure on network operators to enable IPv6, less than 30% of the ASes are currently originating IPv6 prefixes. Since RIRs are unable to allocate additional IPv4 addresses, many network operators try to prolong the lifespan of IPv4 by buying address space allocated to other networks, leading to the emergence of a secondary IP market. This market has been characterized as murky due to the lack of transparency and mechanisms to authenticate the ownership of IP space.

To prevent abuse of this secondary IP market, all RIRs have devised intra-registry transfer policies, starting with RIPE in 2008. All RIRs, except RIPE, have imposed restrictions on IP transactions, requiring a minimum size of transferred address space and adequate justification of need from the buyer. Inter-regional transfers have been approved by ARIN, APNIC, and RIPE. Organizations involved in such transactions must comply with the inter-RIR transfer policies of their local registry. ARIN and APNIC follow the same need-based policy for intra-RIR and inter-RIR transactions. RIPE, in contrast to its intra-RIR policy, requires inter-RIR buyers to document the utilization of at least 50% of the transferred address space for five years. However, these regulations do not apply to transfers resulting from mergers and acquisitions. Under these policies, the first intra-RIR and inter-RIR transfers occurred in October 2009 and October 2012, respectively.

The IPv4 transfer market size has significantly increased over the years, from 17,408 to 40,463,872 IPs for intra-RIR transfers and from 1,792 to 1,885,440 IPs for inter-RIR transfers, with the highest activity occurring within RIPE and ARIN. Moreover, 96% of the IPv4 addresses are exchanged within the same registry, and most of these IP transactions occur within the North America region, while 85% of the inter-RIR transfers originate from ARIN. Despite the increasing prominence of the IPv4 market, there are only a few studies of its ecosystem. Periodically, RIRs and IPv4 address brokers report on the trends and evolution of IP transactions, and some buyers have shared their experiences. Early academic studies discussed the possible implications of market-based mechanisms for reallocating IPv4 addresses. Mueller et al. analyzed the emerging IPv4 transfer market by quantifying the amount of legacy allocations exchanged and the impact of need-based policies on the utilization of transferred blocks. Livadariu et al. provided a comprehensive study on the IPv4 transfer market evolution, the exchanged IPv4 blocks, and the impact on the routing table and IPv6 adoption. They also proposed a method for inferring IP transfers from publicly available data. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has studied the IPv4 transfer market from the perspective of fraudulent behavior and misuse.

### 2.2 Malicious Internet Activities
An IP blacklist is an access control mechanism that aims to block traffic from IP addresses detected to originate fraudulent activities, such as spamming, denial of service, malware, or phishing. Such blacklists are compiled using spamming sinkholes, honeypots, logs from firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and anti-virus tools distributed across the Internet. Several works have studied malicious Internet activities based on IP blacklists. Ramachandran et al. provided one of the first studies, analyzing over 10 million messages received by a spam sinkhole over 18 months and correlating them with lookups to eight blacklists. Their results showed that the combined use of blacklists detects 80% of the spamming hosts. Moreover, the network behavior of serial spammers has distinctive characteristics that can be exploited to develop behavioral and predictive blacklisting. Shina et al. evaluated the accuracy of four spamming blacklists, finding that blacklists have a very low False-Positive Rate, with two of the blacklists having less than 1% FPR, but a high false-negative rate (above 36%) when used individually. Kührer et al. evaluated the effectiveness of 18 blacklists, 15 public and three by AntiVirus (AV) vendors, finding that blacklists derived from AV vendors detect at least 70% of malicious domains for 13 types of malware and at least 90% for seven of these types, outperforming public blacklists. Zhao et al. compiled an extensive historical blacklist dataset to analyze the trends and evolution of malicious activity over a decade.

In addition to detecting malicious activity through monitoring data-plane traffic, several studies have developed techniques to detect attacks through control-plane data. Shue et al. studied the connectivity of ASes over-represented in ten popular blacklists, finding that a small number of ASes with a disproportionate fraction of blacklisted address space are more likely to have dense peering connectivity and exhibit higher frequency of peering changes. Konte et al. proposed ASwatch, a system that aims to identify bulletproof hosting ASes by inferring irregularities in routing and connectivity patterns. Testart et al. profiled serial prefix hijackers by developing a supervised machine learning model, analyzing five years of BGP data to infer 934 ASes that exhibit persistent misbehavior.

We utilize insights and data from these works to conduct a comprehensive analysis of malicious activity involving transferred IP prefixes and organizations participating in the transfer market. We combine both data-plane and control-plane data to compile an extensive dataset of attacks. Our blacklist dataset combines a large number of blacklists compiled by AV vendors, which was found to be the best approach to maximize coverage and minimize false-positives.

## 3 Datasets and Methodology
In this section, we present the data and methods we employ to analyze malicious activities and misuse of transferred IP address space. Figure 1 shows how we synthesize and process an array of chosen datasets.

### 3.1 Processing of IPv4 Transfers
**Collection of Reported IP Transfers.** As the first step, we collect the list of reported intra-RIR and inter-RIR IP transfers published by the RIRs. For each transferred resource, we extract the IPv4 address block, the transfer date, and the names of the seller and buyer organizations. Note that none of the RIRs provide the AS Number (ASN) of the organizations involved in the transfer. For inter-RIR IP transactions, we also retrieve the RIR for both the seller and the buyer organizations. For intra-RIR IP transfers, ARIN and RIPE also indicate the transfer type, whether it occurred due to changes within an organization (mergers and acquisitions) or as a sale of address space between distinct organizations. However, this information is not available for inter-RIR transfers and for transfers within the APNIC and LACNIC regions. Overall, we collected 30,335 transfers involving 28,974 prefixes between 2009-10-12 and 2019-08-24. Of these transfers, 9,564 (31.5%) are labeled as Mergers/Acquisitions, 17,934 (59.1%) as IP sales, while the remaining 2,837 (9.4%) are not labeled.

**Mapping of Organization Names to ASNs.** Next, we aim to find the ASes that map to the organizations active in the IP transfer markets. To this end, we collect historical WHOIS records every three months throughout the IP transfers collection period, i.e., from October 2009 to August 2019. For each allocated ASN, we extract the AS name and the corresponding organization name and try to match the organization names in the RIR transfer lists against the extracted WHOIS fields. We were able to map 8,413 out of the 15,666 organizations involved in the transfer market, 54% of the buyers and 57% of the sellers. Overall, for 48% of the transfers, we managed to map both the seller and the buyer, for 68% only the seller, and for 64% of the transfers, only the buyers. Organizations may not be mapped to an ASN for multiple reasons: an organization may not have an ASN and instead advertise the transferred address space through its upstream providers, some Local Internet Registries (LIRs) may operate no ASNs, and other organizations may operate ASNs under different names.

**Inference of Transfer Types.** For the 9.4% of the transfers without a reported transfer type (merger/acquisition or IP prefix sale), we attempt to infer if the transfer occurred between siblings. For organizations successfully mapped to ASNs, we use CAIDA’s AS-to-Organization inference closest to the date of the transfer. Additionally, for inter-RIR transfers and organizations not mapped to ASNs, we use other available data to make inferences.
