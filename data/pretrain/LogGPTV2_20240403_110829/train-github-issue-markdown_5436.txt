# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Hi there! I'd love the ability to fuzzy search for Control Panel tasks like I
can in the Start Menu. For instance, if I search for "partition", I see
**Create and format hard disk partitions** which takes me to **Disk
Management** , or if I type "users", I get **Add, edit, or remove other
users**.
