rolling shutter attack, we exploit this phenomenon to inject con-
trolled distortions into the captured image.
4 THREAT MODEL
In this paper, we focus on defining a general basis for a rolling
shutter attack on camera-based intelligent systems.
Goal. The adversary’s general goal is to reduce the reliability
and performance of camera-based intelligent systems in a way
that is stealthier than a blinding attack (denial-of-service). In the

simplest case, where the camera is within the attacker’s reach, it is
possible to use paint, bullets, or direct physical force to prevent a
camera from working properly. However, these truly brute-force
attacks are mitigated by keeping a camera out-of-reach or using
tamper sensors in the housing. They are also unattractive as they
risk the attacker being caught on camera while conducting the
attack. While it is straightforward to blind a camera with a very
bright light, this approach suffers from two key problems. First, it
is easily detectable with even simple methods such as ‘scene too
bright/dark’ thresholds or ‘image global change’ comparisons, or
by monitoring automatic exposure levels [47]. Second, in bright
environments, it often provides incomplete disruption. The image is
completely disrupted in one area, but the effect rapidly diminishes
away from that point; leaving much of the image unobscured. The
residual color tint has little effect on computer vision systems such
as object detection or face recognition, that typically make greater
use of high-frequency image components [50].
By contrast, ours is a stealthy attack that minimizes observable
disruption to the system, while in fact impairing its function, as we
demonstrate in more detail in Section 7.2.
Capabilities. We assume the attacker has access only to off-the-
shelf equipment to drive and modulate the laser and to aim it appro-
priately. We consider adversaries that have no control or access over
the target camera, although they may be able to obtain knowledge
of the camera hardware specifications, either from a datasheet or
from a replica device. However, knowledge of camera parameters is
not a requirement, as we explain in Section 5 and demonstrate on a
range of cameras in Section 6.1. Similar to previous work [6, 33, 45]
and as shown in [5], we consider that the adversary has line-of-
sight with the target camera and the capabilities of aiming the laser
at it. In contrast to [23, 37], which assume a rolling shutter attack in
a static scene (i.e., single object, fixed distance and static lighting),
we focus on a more general threat model. Following the assumption
that the adversary cannot access the video of the target camera, we
consider the attack to be executed in a black-box setting without
any feedback channel. As such, distortions can only be injected at
random locations, making it infeasible to target specific objects or
apply optimization techniques. However, our approach makes the
attack applicable to dynamic multi-object scenes.
5 EXPLOITING THE ROLLING SHUTTER
Preliminaries. The rolling shutter attack is based on the consec-
utive exposure and readout of individual pixel rows. Each row is
exposed for a short period texp, often in the range of microseconds,
before the exposure of the next row starts. The time delay ∆trst
between the reset pulses of consecutive lines can be exploited to
inject noise that causes partial distortion of the captured image. If a
modulated bright light, e.g., a laser, is pointed at the target camera,
additional light can be selectively injected into rows of the image.
The proportion of the image that is disturbed is controlled by the
time ton, which determines how long the laser is switched on (i.e.,
is emitting light). The attack is illustrated in Figure 3, which depicts
the row-wise acquisition of a single frame. In Figure 3a, the readout
starts at the top-most row, the laser is inactive, and consequently, no
image disturbances occur. At some point, the laser is turned on and
the row that is currently exposed, e.g., the 7th row in Figure 3b, is
illuminated and the original image information is perturbed. Before
the next line is exposed, the laser is switched off, and the rest of the
frame is captured without any further interference, see Figure 3c.
5.1 Controlling the Distortion Size
Shining a modulated light onto the image sensor will inject light
in sets of adjacent pixel rows; we refer to each injection as a dis-
tortion. Depending on the use-case, the attacker might want to
introduce large or narrow distortions. The appearance of the dis-
tortions depends on several factors. Without loss of generality, we
focus on rolling shutters that scroll top-to-bottom along the image
sensor. The same modeling applies for left-to-right rolling shut-
ters, although the distortion would appear vertically rather than
horizontally (as in [23]).
Mechanisms behind Distortion Size. The number of pixel rows
that are illuminated by a distortion (distortion size) depends on four
factors: (i) the absolute exposure time of individual rows texp, (ii)
the time the laser is switched on ton, (iii) the time between RST
pulses ∆trst, which is determined by the clock speed of the analog-
to-digital converter, and (iv) the time delay between the last RST
pulse and the moment the laser is switched on, o. Figure 4 shows
how the four parameters interact to define the distortion size. Based
on the four parameters, the adversary can precisely calculate the
distortion size:

No =
− 1, o ∈ [0, ∆trst).
(1)
Since the attacked has no feedback channel, the laser cannot be
synchronized with the rolling shutter of the target camera, so the
offset o is unknown. Consequentially, the attacker can only learn
an upper and lower bound for the number of consecutive rows that
will be illuminated, that is:

exposure times for consecutive rows overlap [34]. As a consequence,
it is impossible to affect individual pixel rows with the laser, as the
additional illumination will affect multiple rows at once, depending
on the current texp. Figure 4 shows the frame acquisition for two
different texp, a short and a long one, showing how larger texp
leads to wider overlap across consecutive rows.
Distortion Repetition. The adversary can increase the number of
injected distortions per-frame by increasing the laser frequency
f . Intuitively, if the laser frequency f matches the frame rate F of
the camera, each camera frame will present exactly one injected
distortion. To cause interference at multiple parts in the frame at the
same time, the attacker can increase f . The number of distortions
per frame can be calculated as follows:
f
F
.
ND =
(4)
When f is not an integer multiple of F, the location of the dis-
tortions will change over consecutive frames. For example, when
f > F, the distortions will scroll downwards across consecutive
frames. Depending on the attack scenario, the adversary can pick
f accordingly to enhance, reduce or even prevent the movement of
the distortions.
5.2 Estimating Parameters
While the mechanism to control the distortion size is consistent, in
practice each camera has different parameters. This means that the
adversary needs to estimate these parameters for a target camera to
control the distortion size, using Equation 3 and Equation 4. While
the attack can be carried out without accurately estimating these
parameters, a better estimate will lead to the attack outcome being
more predictable (i.e., more effective for the attacker). Across the
introduced parameters, ton and f are controlled directly by the
adversary, ∆trst and F are camera-dependent but static, texp is
camera-dependent and dynamic. In the following, we describe how
an adversary can infer the camera-dependent parameters using the
information on the technical datasheet of a camera model.
Estimating ∆trst and F. The operating frame rate F is generally
available in the camera specifications (common examples are 25fps
or 30fps). The clock speed ∆trst is also sometimes available, nev-
ertheless, when it is not, it can be estimated precisely using F and
the full resolution of the image sensor:
1
∆trst =
F · Nrows
,
(5)
where Nrows is the number of pixel rows of the image sensor. For
some cameras, the size of the physical resolution of the photodiode
array (total resolution) is larger than the maximum resolution used
to record videos. For example, a 1920×1080 full-HD video may have
been recorded on a camera with Nrows > 1080. The rolling shutter
will still go through all Nrows pixel rows to capture additional image
data, such as color information, but ignore a portion of them to
read frames in a smaller resolution than the physical resolution; the
ignored rows are known as dead areas. If the target image sensor
has dead areas, Equation 4, used to calculate the number of injected
distortions, has to be extended by the ratio of visible rows Nvisible
and total rows Nrows:
(6)
The sensor’s total resolution Nrows and video resolution Nvisible
can be found in the camera’s technical specifications.

Estimating texp. During operation, texp is set automatically by
an auto-exposure mechanism that balances the camera’s texp with
the current ambient light level: dimmer scenes will require larger
texp to produce sufficient quality frames. Cameras have differing
light sensitivities and lens apertures, and therefore use different
texp for the same lighting conditions. To estimate texp, the adver-
sary can use the minimal luminous exposure parameter Hv required
by the camera to capture a usable frame and measure the current
ambient light level Ev, with a light meter, at the time of the attack.
Based on Ev and Hv, the exposure time texp can be calculated:
texp = Hv
Ev
.
(7)
In Appendix A, we show examples of how we accurately estimated
texp. In case Hv is not available, the adversary can measure the
ambient light level Ev versus texp relationship by using a replica
of the target camera and performing a set of measurements in
controlled conditions. At the time of the attack, the adversary needs
to measure Ev, lookup the respective texp that would be set by the
target camera, and adjust the attack parameters accordingly. In
Section 6.2, we demonstrate that imprecise estimates of texp do not
affect the distortion size substantially.
