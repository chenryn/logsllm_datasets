I've written a repro test here:  
https://github.com/prashantv/listener-repro/blob/master/main.go
It basically does the following:
  * Start a listener
  * Create `connectionsBeforeClose` connections to the listener (which should succeed)
  * Close the listener
  * Create another connection to the listener
On the listener side, I expect to receive at most `connectionsBeforeClose`
successful connections. Any extra connections causes the `runTest` method to
return an error.
This works as expected on OSX, but on Linux, it seems to receive a successful
connection after the listener has been closed.
Some things I noticed:
  * If `connectionsBeforeClose` is set to 0, then no unexpected connections are made after the listener is closed
  * The issue also disappears if I `enableSleep`
I would expect that a Listener will not accept any further socket attempts
after `Close` has returned.
