Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
The goal of the challenge is unclear :
  * You should precise that HyperDev has been renamed to Gomix
  * We don't have links to any boilerplates or any tutorial to start a project on Gomix
  * We don't know how to relate Gomix to the FCC challenges
It seems that all of the backend challenges feel the same.
