### Title: Black Hat EU-21: Skeletons in the App Sandboxâ€”5+ Ways to Escape

The security and trust associated with the App Store are largely due to its mandatory sandboxing requirements. The App Sandbox ensures that users can install applications without fear, as it contains potentially malicious apps. In this talk, we will delve into a series of logic vulnerabilities in LaunchServices (CVE-2021-30677, CVE-2021-30783, and others) that allowed attackers to escape the App Sandbox and bypass privacy protections, despite the enhanced security mechanisms introduced in macOS Big Sur and Catalina.

You will learn how a seemingly simple issue can be exploited in multiple ways, and we promise to keep the session engaging and entertaining. We will also release a tool to assist in reversing the latest versions of macOS and enhance an existing tool to help identify and detect similar vulnerabilities. Finally, we will lay the groundwork for future bug discoveries and highlight a previously overlooked attack surface.
