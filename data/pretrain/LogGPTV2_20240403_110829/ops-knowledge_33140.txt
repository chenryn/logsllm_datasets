**Query:**

I am developing a webpage using Django on my PC, which runs Windows 7. I now need to test some pages on a tablet. I was wondering if it is possible to access my localhost from an Android tablet. Both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network at home.

I have read many questions and answers on Stack Overflow and other forums, but none of them provided a concrete solution. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 with Android 4.0.4.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**Response:**

To access your Django development server from your Android tablet, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Django Development Server:**
   Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to your Django project directory. Run the following command to start the server, binding it to your local IP address:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
   Alternatively, you can bind it to a specific IP address if you know it (e.g., `192.168.0.100`):
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver 192.168.0.100:8000
   ```

2. **Connect Both Devices to the Same Wi-Fi Network:**
   Ensure that both your PC and your Android tablet are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

3. **Find Your PC's IP Address:**
   On your PC, open the Command Prompt and type:
   ```sh
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for the IPv4 address under the section for your Wi-Fi adapter. It will typically look something like `192.168.0.100`.

4. **Access the Django Server from Your Tablet:**
   On your Android tablet, open a web browser and enter the URL in the address bar. The URL should be in the format:
   ```
   http://<your_pc_ip_address>:8000
   ```
   For example, if your PC's IP address is `192.168.0.100`, you would enter:
   ```
   http://192.168.0.100:8000
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to access your Django development server from your Android tablet.

If you encounter any issues, make sure that there are no firewall rules blocking the connection and that both devices are indeed on the same network.

Good luck with your testing!
