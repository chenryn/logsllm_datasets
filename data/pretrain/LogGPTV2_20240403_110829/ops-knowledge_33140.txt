User: I am developing a webpage in django (on my pc with windows 7) and now i need to test some pages in tablet pcs. suddenly the thought came if i can have an access to my localhost in windows from android tablet. is that possible? I am in the same wifi connection in both devices at home. 
i read a lot questions and answers regarding this issue in stackoverflow and other places, but none of them gave me some concrete solutions. 
I have samsung tab 2 10.1 with android 4.0.4.
appreciate any help, thanks
Assistant: Try this
python manage.py runserver 
then connect both tablet and system to same wifi and browse in the address
eg: python manage.py runserver 192.168.0.100:8000
In tablet type that url in adress bar
