User: if i want to script a mini-application (in the Terminal) in mac and windows, which one is preferred: ruby or python?
or is there no major difference just a matter of taste?
cause i know python definetely is a good scripting language.
thanks
Assistant: I believe python and ruby (since at least OS X 10.4) came pre-installed on Mac, that is a convenience. 
There are easy installers for Windows. On Linux of course your mileage may vary.
As much as i like python myself, don't think one is better than the other for your purpose.
