User: Besides the fact that node.js is written in JS and Tornado in Python, what are some of the differences between the two?  They're both non-blocking asynchronous web servers, right?  Why choose one over the other besides the language?
Assistant: node.js uses V8 which compiles into assembly code, tornado doesn't do that yet.
Other than that (which doesn't actually seem to make much difference to the speed), it's the ecosystem. Do you prefer the event model of JS, or the way Python works? Are you happier using Python or JS libraries?
