I want to open all my text files with Atom, but I couldn't find a good way to
do that, that's not breaking with every Atom update, and I don't get Atom
icons.
Did I do something wrong? Is there a way to make the existing "Open with Atom"
right-click menu entry "stick"?  
Please tell me there's a more streamlined way to achieve correct file
associations on Windows!
Expected behaviour:  
Either Atom offers on installation to associate with files typically edited
with a text editor, or offers a setting where you can do that post-
installation.  
Failing that, the user is given a clear method of associating desired file
types with Atom, e.g. using the "open with" dialog like other editors allow.
Observed behaviour:
  1. Atom is not associated with any files, and there's no setting to change that. There is a context menu entry, but that requires constant right-clicking for every file you want to open in Atom, so is not really desirable.
  2. OK, so I thought I'd manually change the "open With" choice for every file type to a new default setting. (Right click a txt file - open with - set new default application)  
Puzzlingly, Atom is not in the list of proposed applications. O_o
  3. Nevermind, let's hit "further applications" and select from there. Huh, Atom is not in C:\Program Files, either, so that didn't work.
  4. OK, then let's select the installed desktop link (or start menu entry). Hooray, I could select it. Oh, it just flickers a terminal at you for a split second. Turns out, this just calls some update.exe, and something gets messed up (probably command args?).
  5. After some googling, I found out that Atom gets installed in AppData somewhere, so let's search the exe there. Erm, the exe is in a version-specific folder, so I'd have to re-associate all my file bindings after every update. No, thank you :-(
  6. the cmd file in the bin directory is an option, but to select that you have to 
    * go to the location in a separate Explorer window (to display hidden items to be able to see AppData, which you can't do in the file selection dialog)
    * copy the path to bin
    * navigate the open with dialog until you get to the point where you can select arbitrary files
    * paste the path
    * select atom.cmd
  7. Hooray, now I can open files with Atom all the time, but: 
    * I got no way to select the Atom icon, I got an empty white rectangle.
    * It flickers the terminal for a split second, which interestingly does not happen when starting atom via the start menu. Annoying, but not vital.
    * It says "atom.cmd" in the relevant dialogs/menus, which is not exactly beautiful/elegant.
    * I can't imagine a normal user to go through this dance to do this, compared to the experience in other editors like Notepad++.
Versions: Windows 8.1, Atom 198; dialog strings translated from German, so may
not be identical to an english windows.
