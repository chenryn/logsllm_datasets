### Issue Description

The code runs perfectly when the master is set to `localhost`. However, when I submit the job to a cluster with two worker nodes, I encounter an error. All machines have the same version of Python and packages, and I have correctly set the path to point to the desired Python version (3.5.1). When I submit my Spark job via the master SSH session, I receive the following error:

```
py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.api.python.PythonRDD.runJob.
  : org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 2.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.3 in stage 2.0 (TID 5, .c..internal): org.apache.spark.api.python.PythonException: Traceback (most recent call last):

      import numpy
  ImportError: No module named 'numpy'
```

I have access to the worker nodes, and I get the same error message for both. I am unsure if I am missing some environment settings. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

### Attempted Solution

I submitted the same job using Google Dataproc, and it worked without any issues. It seems that using the utilities provided by the Google Cloud Platform, such as Dataproc, can help resolve environment-related problems.

### Additional Information

- **Python Version**: 3.5.1
- **Cluster Configuration**: Two worker nodes
- **Environment**: Hadoop YARN

### Request for Assistance

If anyone has encountered similar issues or has suggestions on how to ensure that all necessary modules (e.g., `numpy`) are available on the worker nodes, please share your insights.
