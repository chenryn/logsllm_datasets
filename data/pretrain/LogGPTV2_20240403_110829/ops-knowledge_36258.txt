User: I have Mac OS X 10.5.7 with Python 2.5. I need to test a package I am working on with Python 2.3 for compatibility. I don't want to downgrade my whole system so is there a way to do an install of Python 2.3 that does not change the system python?
Assistant: You can also use the Fink package manager and simply to "fink install python2.3".
If you need Python 2.3 to be your default, you can simply change /sw/bin/python and /sw/bin/pydoc to point to the version you want (they sit in /sw/bin/).
