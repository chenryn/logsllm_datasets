User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Single Computer not Accepting Domain Credentials after being added to Domain I have one computer that refuses any domain credentials. 

This computer is running Win10 and my DCs are Server 2012 r2. After adding this particular computer to the domain it will not accept any domain user password. It simply says "The user name or password is incorrect. Try again".

I know the password works, as the same domain administrator password was used to add the computer to the domain successfully. I've tried multiple domain accounts unsuccessfully and was able to manually add a domain user account under manage users via the local admin. I was not able to add the domain\Administrator because it says there is already an account. I even tried going through the Network ID wizard which accepted the domain admin account and password however it still won't log in.

DNS is pointing correctly to our 2 domain controllers.

It is showing under Domain Computers in AD and the DNS server shows forward and reverse lookups for it. However it is not showing up under DHCP leases even thought it's getting an IP.

It is the only computer with this problem. I have added other computers to the domain recently, before and after. I even wiped and re-installed Windows 10 but the login issue remains.

No real errors under event log but noticed some Time service issues because it was set to manual. Setting to auto start didn't help anything.

Any thoughts? Any help is appreciated! I'm at a loss....

Assistant: Just had the same issue - all domain accounts giving &quot;incorrect password&quot; error, local user account working fine - and a reboot fixed it for me.
I realize this question is several years old, but at least here's a fix that has actually worked for the problem described in this question, at least once!
