Rapid urbanization and climate change have contributed to an increased incidence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in natural waters HABs caused 
by Microcystis aeruginosa produce toxic secondary metabolites, such as microcystins (MCs) To understand resource partitioning strategies 
between cell growth and MCs production in response to environmental triggers, we tested the effect of interactions between light and nitrogen 
on Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 using integrative omics We measured the molecular changes to light and nitrogen combinations at the 
transcriptome and metabolome levels We mapped these to networks of cellular processes thereby identifying overall strategy for resource re-
allocation Statistical models revealed that both light and nitrogen affected the transcriptome and metabolome, however, light was the major factor 
driving the changes at transcriptome level, when compared to nitrogen On the contrary, effects at metabolome level were less pronounced and 
were restricted to a few inter-related networks that share rate-limiting substrates and pathway intermediates Through the integrative systems level 
approach, we found certain networks belonging to cellular growth, cellular scavenging and secondary metabolite metabolism that drive the overall 
resource partitioning strategy in Microcystis Additionally, two rate limiting metabolites (malonyl-CoA and metabolite couplet SAM; S-adenosyl 
methionine–SAH; S-S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine) that occur at the crossroads of the light and nitrogen dependent pathways were identified, thus 
controlling the metabolic flux and resource allocation in Microcystis cultures Through these observations, we provide a conceptual model for 
environmental responses of Microcystis This model could be validated through controlled feeding experiments and specific genetic mutants to 
obtain further insights

Combining acute toxicity, toxicokinetics and metabolomics approaches for comprehensive toxicity assessment of xenobiotics 
in aquatic organisms - Zebrafish embryos exposed to triclosan as a case study
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dimitrios Damalas, Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, University of Athens, Greece
CO-AUTHORS: E. Panagopoulou, M. Agalou, D. Beis, M.H. Lamoree, P.E.G. Leonards, N.S. Thomaidis
The ever increasing contamination of the aquatic environment from xenobiotics has raised concerns, regarding their adverse effects on aquatic 
organisms To evaluate the impact of toxicants in depth, the whole xenometabolome and endometabolome of aquatic organisms should be 
studied Zebrafish provides a promising alternative model for toxicological studies The overall goal of this study was to highlight a high-throughput 
testing strategy, incorporating data from different approaches (fish embryo toxicity, toxicokinetics and metabolomics) for a comprehensive toxicity 
assessment of xenobiotics in aquatic organisms Zebrafish embryos exposed to triclosan (TCS) were used as a case study Initially, potential acute 
toxicity of TCS in zebrafish embryos was assessed Afterwards, the uptake and biotransformation of TCS by zebrafish ebryos were evaluated 
The final objective was to establish a wide-scope targeted metabolomics screening workflow to investigate the induced toxicity in a biochemical 
perspective and associate the observed toxicity/phenotype with changes at molecular level To cover the wide polarity range of xeno- and 
endometabolome, a platform with broad analytical coverage was developed, combining RPLC and HILIC with ESI-HRMS Suspect and non-target 
screening workflows were applied for the identification of biotransformation products Regarding the metabolomics part of the study, a database 
of 600 endogenous metabolites was established, covering a broad range of primary metabolism This approach is an alternative strategy to the 
classic targeted methods, as it did not focus on a few metabolic pathways, for which we already know that are affected by the specific stimulant The 
proposed strategy unravels the involvement of unexpected metabolic pathways

An Omics Approach Towards Identification of Unknown Emerging Pollutants in Marine Waters
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Steve Huysman, Ghent University, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Francis Vanryckeghem, Kristof Demeestere, Lynn Vanhaecke
The potential prevalence of emerging organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment has become a significant risk for public and ecological 
health, which is stressed by different regulatory bodies Despite this, legislation so far mainly focuses on a few priority pollutants, thereby missing 
a substantial fraction of the known and unknown compounds occurring in water Hence, the prevalence and identity of most compounds remains 
unexplored Therefore, this study presents a novel analytical strategy for elucidating structurally related emerging organic pollutants in the aquatic 
environment In-house developed and validated UHPLC-HR-Q-Orbitrap-MS methods targeting 70 steroids (Huysman et al, 2017) and 27 plasticizers 
(Huysman et al, 2019) were used to enable the detection of 1292 unique unknown emerging organic pollutants in 24 seawater samples (obtained 
from the Belgian part of the North Sea) To elucidate typical fragmentation profiles and identify characteristic fragments of the above-mentioned 
chemical pollutants, the target standards were respectively fragmented at 35 and 20 eV As a result, typical fragmentation profiles were obtained for 
the steroids and plasticizers The generated fragments of the unknowns were screened – using a newly written Python code – on their agreement 
with characteristic fragments and neutral losses obtained from the target standards In total, 13% (n=173) of the unknowns present in water could 
be tentatively identified, ie 125 steroids, 21 alkylphenols and 27 phthalates, at a confidence level of Tier 3 Finally, during untargeted screening of 
seawater samples, all target analytes were successfully detected, confirming that fragmentation occurred also in a salty matrix

Lipid changes in different tissues of rats after chronic exposure to ambient fine particulate matter
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ting-Zhen Chen, Institute of Environmental Health, National Taiwan University, Taiwan
CO-AUTHORS: Hao-Jan Liang, Sheng-Han Lee, Wen-Ling Chen, Tsun-Jen Cheng, Ching-Yu Lin
Fine particulate matter (PM25) is able to pass the respiratory barrier and further enter the circulatory system, and consequently spread to the whole 
body PM25-induced toxicity has been correlated with oxidative stress, which may lead to lipid perturbation Our previous studies have applied a 
lipidomic platform to investigate the effects of PM25 exposure on the pulmonary lipids in rats inhaled ambient air, and found significantly altered 
phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels might impair pulmonary surfactant functions However, the lipid effects of PM25 on other organs have not been 
fully elucidated yet In this study, we examined the lipid effects of chronic PM25 exposure on various organs using a rat inhalation model Five male 
rats were continually whole-body exposed to ambient air containing PM25 from the outside of the Public Health building in Taipei city for 8 months, 
while five rats were inhaled filtered air Blood samples and various tissues, including heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, testis and epididymis 
were collected Then the phosphorylcholine-containing lipids from each organ were extracted for further ultra-performance liquid chromatography 
system coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) In our 
PLS-DA models, the patterns of phosphorylcholine-containing lipid were altered in the testis, pancreas, heart, liver and kidney of rats exposed 
to PM25 Numerous phosphorylcholine-containing lipid species associated with exposure were identified Results also showed decreased 
PC(16:0/18:1) was both observed in the serum and testis Further studies to verify potential biomarkers for PM25 exposure are needed

Metabolomics-based biomarker discovery for bee health monitoring: A proof of concept study concerning diagnosis  
of nutritional stress in Bombus terrestris
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Luoluo Wang, Ghent University, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Ivan Meeus, Caroline Rombouts, Lieven Van Meulebroek, Lynn Vanhaecke, Guy Smagghe
Bee pollinators are exposed to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors Understanding the effects of a single stressor in the complex 
environmental context of antagonistic/synergistic interactions, is critical to pollinator monitoring and may serve as early warning system before 
a pollination crisis This study aimed at methodically improving the diagnosis of bee stressors using a simultaneous untargeted and targeted 
metabolomics-based approach Analysis of 84 Bombus terrestris hemolymph samples selected 8 metabolites retained as potential biomarkers that 
showed excellent discrimination for nutritional stress In parallel, 8 significantly altered metabolites, as revealed by targeted profiling, were also 
assigned as candidate biomarkers Furthermore, machine learning algorithms were applied on the above-described two biomarker sets, whereby 
the untargeted eight components showed the best classification performance with sensitivity and specificity up to 99 and 100%, respectively 
Besides, based on pathway and biochemistry analysis, we propose that gluconeogenesis contributed significantly to blood sugar stability in 
bumblebees maintained on a low carbohydrate diet Taken together, this study demonstrates that metabolomics-based biomarker discovery holds 
promising potential for improving bee health monitoring and to identify stressor related to energy intake and other environmental stressors

iNVERTOX: Characterising background metabolomic variability and subsequent alteration in the freshwater invertebrate, 
Gammarus pulex, upon exposure to psychoactive pharmaceuticals
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Thomas Miller, King’s College London, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: James I. MacRae, Nicolas R. Bury, Stewart F. Owen, Leon P. Barron
The (pseudo)persistence of emerging contaminants in the environment represents a risk for the organisms that are exposed to them ‘Omics 
technologies are providing a powerful tool within environmental toxicology to better understand the effects of these exposure scenarios However, 
interpretation of metabolite data to understand toxicological responses is challenging The variability in individual metabolomes for a species, 
or a “background metabolome” should be established to determine possible confounding factors such as age, sex and moulting (among others) 
that may influence data interpretation Thus, we have characterised the effect of these factors on the metabolic variability in the freshwater 
invertebrate, G pulex Herein, an analytical method is presented for the extraction and non-target analysis of the metabolome in G pulex Briefly, 
a dual phase liquid extraction was used followed by HILIC-HRMS to enable detection of metabolic features extracted from individual animals 
Animals collected from the field were analysed immediately and compared to animals that were extracted after a fixed period of acclimatisation to 
laboratory conditions or exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of antidepressants The results indicated that biological sex, moulting 
stage and acclimatisation period affected the metabolic variability and should be investigated to aid understanding of pathways involved in effect-
based studies Furthermore, it may be prudent to pre-select animals based on these factors to reduce inherent variability in the data Overall, the 
characterisation of metabolic variance for invertebrates along with the use of metabolomics shows a very powerful approach for understanding 
adverse effects that may be associated with environmental contaminants

and metabolism assessment
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sandra Sendyk, Associate Scientist, Switzerland

Human organotypic respiratory epithelial tissue cultures are routinely used for in vitro toxicological assessment of biological impact upon 
exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) and aerosol from smoke-free products at the air-liquid interface Metabolism of deposited compounds is a critical 
parameter to be considered for their bioavailability and assessment of potential toxicity Nicotine is commonly used as a marker of exposure, and 
its metabolism pathway is well established CS is a complex mixture of more than 6,000 compounds, a significant number of which have known 
toxicological effects and are associated with various smoking-related diseases As CS or aerosol from smoke-free products represent a challenging 
matrix for in vitro testing and metabolite screening, a multi-compound method using dual-column liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution 
accurate mass spectrometry was established Nicotine and its major metabolites were quantified in extracts of organotypic respiratory epithelial 
tissue cultures following exposure to CS and aerosol from smoke-free products for 112 puffs Quantification was performed by stable isotope-
labeled internal standards for each analyte or analyte group In total, three major metabolites of nicotine were identified, representing approximately 
1% of the nicotine deposited on the investigated tissues Additional exposure markers correlated with nicotine were investigated to better 
understand the deposition of aerosols and CS on organotypic respiratory epithelial tissue cultures

Toxicity and metabolomics of zebrafish exposed to per- and polyfluorinated alkylated substances and alternatives to select 
more environmentally compounds
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Pim Leonards, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Jessica Legradi
Per- and polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) have been widely used as organic surfactants in industrial and consumer products While 
these applications made PFASs very appealing their properties make PFAS very persistent in the environment In this study we performed a 
chemical alternatives assessment using metabolomics between PFOA and PFOS and alternative chemicals to be able to select environmentally 
friendly compounds Zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) were chronically and acutely exposured (01 µM , 1 µM , 10 µM ) to PFOA and PFOs and its 
alternatives PFHxS, PFBS, siloxanes (D4, D5 and TMS), and GenX to study the mechanism of toxicity No significant effects on mortality, visual 
developmental abnormalities, and swimming activity were observed for all compounds Embryos were subjected to further investigation in an 
attempt to address potential genetic and metabolomic effectsTranscription of the DNA damage gene was significantly up-regulated by over 2-fold 
relative to the control vs PFOA, PFHxS, PFOS and Genx Interestingly, the lipid metabolism gene was up-regulated by over 2-fold in the embryos 
exposed to PFOS and GenX These observations corresponds well with the metabolomics data that showed the regulation of many lipids (PC, PE, 
TAG, SM) Based on the results of this study, alterations in lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipids) may be a metabolic pathway affected by both 
PFASs and their alternatives GENX, as alternative to PFOA, displayed a pattern of similar activity as the PFASs The alternatives D4, D5 and TMS 
appears to have a lower impact on metabolic pathways (eg lipids) than PFOA

According to the World Health Organization, chronic non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes, are causing up to 60% of 
annual global mortality The incidence of these diseases is not only due to genetic factors, but also to, or in combination with, the environmental factors, 
which comprise both external and internal exposures External exposure, for instance to environmental contaminants, affects the internal exposure, ie 
biological factors, such as metabolism, which in turn mediate risks of various diseases However, little is known how the exposure to chemical pollutants 
affects the metabolome In this project, we explored the lipid and metabolic changes in mice following exposure to a mixture of persistent organic 
pollutants (POPs) containing organochlorides, organobromides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances Prior to blood collection, non-obese diabetic 
mice were pre- and postnatally exposed to two different concentration levels of POPs Lipidomic profiling of mice blood serum samples was carried out 
on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, while polar metabolite profiling was conducted on GC-Q-TOF/MS Significant changes in lipid and polar metabolite profiles were 
observed between mice in the control and treatment groups The largest difference in metabolite regulation was detected between control and the 
high exposure group In particular, many phospholipids and several triglycerides containing polyunsaturated fatty acids were down regulated, while 
tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites were upregulated Our findings suggest that alteration of the lipid profile in mice exposed to the POP mixture is 
similar to previously reported metabolic changes associated with higher risk of type 1 diabetes

High-resolution Mass Spectrometry for Monitoring Physiological Impacts and Biotransformation Products in Fish Exposed  
to Wastewater Effluent
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ioanna Ntai, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Jonathan Mosley, Marina Evich, Drew Ekman, Jenna Cavallin, Dan Villeneuve, Gerald Ankley, Tim Collette
High-resolution mass spectrometry is advantageous for both metabolomics analyses and monitoring contaminant biotransformation products in fish 
exposed to wastewater effluent For the current study, we conducted exposures of male and female fathead minnows to wastewater effluent using 
an onsite, flow-through system providing real-time exposure at the Western Lake Superior Sanitary District (WLSSD) wastewater treatment plant 
in Duluth, MN, USA  Metabolomic changes in liver tissue and skin mucus were measured for fish exposed for 21 days to control water or control 
water mixed with treated wastewater effluent at levels of 5%, 20% or 100% effluent Skin mucus metabolomic changes reflected, in part, processes 
by which the fish biotransformed xenobiotics in the effluent Regression models built with liver data provide additional evidence that xenobiotic 
transformation processes are induced, while also shedding light on the sex-specific nature of these responses The detection of sex-specific phase 
II transformation products (eg, glucuronidated bisphenol A) of chemicals from the effluent in the fish skin mucus led to the development of a novel 
untargeted method to identify glucuronidated biotransformation products in fish bile Utilizing traditional enzyme hydrolysis, high-resolution mass 
spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics methods, and a structure-specific neutral loss-dependent MS3 fragmentation method with a Thermo 
Scientific Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid mass spectrometer, we demonstrate this method using bile from these treated wastewater effluent-exposed fish as a 
potential means of screening for relevant contaminants found in complex environmental mixtures

1H-NMR Metabolomics Study of Arabidopsis Thaliana Exposure to PFOA and PFOS
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Liam O’Hara, University of Guelph, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Julie Konzuk, James Longstaffe
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are environmental contaminants originating from their use in industrial 
surfactants, textile finishes and flame retardants Their widespread use has resulted in these compounds becoming ubiquitous environmental 
contaminants The persistence of PFOA and PFOS poses an ecological and health risk due to movement up the food web through bioaccumulation 
Non-targeted metabolomics provides an avenue to determine the subtle responses by plants when exposed to these compounds at environmental 
levels This poster presents new work exploring the application of non-targeted metabolomics using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to 
understand the effect of PFOA and PFOS contamination on plants Arabidopsis thaliana was been chosen as the model organism, as previous 
studies have shown signs of oxidative stress at high concentrations of PFOA Non-targeted metabolomics provided insight into changes expressed 
in the metabolism of the plants when exposed to environmentally relevant contamination Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial 
least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to determine the variation in the metabolic profiles in A thaliana as a response to PFOA 
and PFOS contamination This method could potentially be used on a wide range of species to determine whether they show signs of exposure to 
PFOA or PFOS contamination at levels that may otherwise be difficult to monitor

Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides and potentially able to affect the intestinal microbiota, since it inhibits the aromatic amino acid 
synthesis via the shikimate pathways which is also used by bacteria Chemostat cultivation of intestinal microbiota is increasingly used as a model 
system and consequently methods for quantitation of glyphosate and its degradation product AMPA in microbiome model systems are needed 
Hence, an optimized protocol for the analysis of both glyphosate and AMPA by simple extraction with methanol:acetonitrile:water (2:3:1), while 
omitting further enrichment steps, was established Glyphosate and AMPA were separated by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and 
identified with a targeted MS/MS method on a QTRAP 5500 system (AB Sciex) The limit of detection (LOD) in extracted water samples was < 2 ng/
mL for both, glyphosate and AMPA In complex intestinal medium the LOD was 2 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively The 
method was used to determine the glyphosate concentration in a bioreactor model of swine colon Furthermore this method is compatible with the 
extraction protocol for an untargeted metabolomics analysis and feasible for different media used in microbiome reactors The approach presented 
here allows the quantitation of glyphosate and AMPA in bioreactor fluids and thus enables studies on the metabolization of glyphosate and its 
impact on the intestinal microbiota

Biopesticides or Biocontrol Products (BP) represents an interesting alternative to the conventional pesticides However, there is a need of technical 
efficacy studies and ecotoxicological profile references To date, the half-life, t1/2, was often used to study the fate of pesticides in environmental 
matrices However, this value doesn’t give any information regarding the formation of by-products and the effect on biodiversity Consequently, an 
innovative approach based on metabolomics (LC-MS), the Environmental Metabolic Footprinting (EMF), was recently developed in the lab On one 
hand, the EMF gives rise to a new integrative proxy, the resilience that corresponds to the time needed for the compound dissipation and its effects 
on the matrix (meta-metabolome) On the other hand, the EMF can be used in order to determine the preharvest interval (PHI) that corresponds to 
the time needed to have no residue (xenometabolome) difference between the treated sample and the control The degradation of the BP on vine 
leaves was monitored Vines were treated against powdery mildew with 2 fungicides BPs The vine leaves were sampled at different time points 
between 2 treatments in order to study the BP degradation (kinetics) The extraction steps were optimized and the extracts were analyzed using 
a UHPLC-HRMS instrument For now, only the xenometabolome was studied and the preliminary results showed a degradation kinetics for the 2 
fungicides BP with a PHI between 4 and 10 days The endometabolome is currently analyzed The project lasts 3 years therefore the same study will 
be repeated and extended to other matrices
