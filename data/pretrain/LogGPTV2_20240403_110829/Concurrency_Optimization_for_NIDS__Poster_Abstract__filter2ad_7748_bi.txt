### NTS and Bioassays for Monitoring Complex Chemical Mixtures

Non-targeted screening (NTS) and bioassays were conducted to monitor the biological effects of complex mixtures of chemicals. The NTS data was analyzed for predicted and known transformation products of the spike-in compounds. Multivariate analysis methods were used to evaluate patterns and trends, enabling efficient visualization of the complex data. By integrating the chemical NTS data with the biological effect-based results, potential toxicity was accounted for during the prioritization process. These developed workflows allowed for the monitoring of water quality and changes in water quality during water treatment.

### P-305: Integrative Omics Analysis Reveals Resource Partitioning Strategies During Toxin Production in Microcystis aeruginosa

**Presenting Author:** Shruti Pavagadhi, National University of Singapore, Singapore  
**Co-Authors:** Di Pan, Shivshankar Umashankar, Amit Rai, Peter I. Benke, Megha Rai, Gourvendu Saxena, Vamshidhar Gangu, Sanjay Swarup

**Abstract:**
Rapid urbanization and climate change have led to an increased incidence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in natural waters. HABs caused by *Microcystis aeruginosa* produce toxic secondary metabolites, such as microcystins (MCs). To understand resource partitioning strategies between cell growth and MC production in response to environmental triggers, we tested the effects of light and nitrogen interactions on *Microcystis aeruginosa* PCC 7806 using integrative omics. We measured molecular changes at the transcriptome and metabolome levels under different light and nitrogen conditions. These changes were mapped to networks of cellular processes, revealing the overall strategy for resource reallocation. Statistical models indicated that both light and nitrogen affected the transcriptome and metabolome, but light was the primary driver of transcriptomic changes. In contrast, metabolomic effects were less pronounced and confined to a few inter-related networks. Through this integrative systems-level approach, we identified key networks related to cellular growth, scavenging, and secondary metabolite metabolism that drive the resource partitioning strategy in *Microcystis*. Additionally, two rate-limiting metabolites (malonyl-CoA and SAM/SAH) were identified as critical regulators of metabolic flux and resource allocation. This conceptual model can be validated through controlled feeding experiments and specific genetic mutants to gain further insights.

### P-306: Combining Acute Toxicity, Toxicokinetics, and Metabolomics Approaches for Comprehensive Toxicity Assessment of Xenobiotics in Aquatic Organisms - Zebrafish Embryos Exposed to Triclosan as a Case Study

**Presenting Author:** Dimitrios Damalas, Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, University of Athens, Greece  
**Co-Authors:** E. Panagopoulou, M. Agalou, D. Beis, M.H. Lamoree, P.E.G. Leonards, N.S. Thomaidis

**Abstract:**
The increasing contamination of aquatic environments by xenobiotics has raised concerns about their adverse effects on aquatic organisms. To thoroughly evaluate these impacts, the xenometabolome and endometabolome of aquatic organisms should be studied. Zebrafish provide a promising alternative model for toxicological studies. This study aimed to highlight a high-throughput testing strategy incorporating data from fish embryo toxicity, toxicokinetics, and metabolomics for a comprehensive toxicity assessment of xenobiotics in aquatic organisms. Zebrafish embryos exposed to triclosan (TCS) were used as a case study. Initially, the acute toxicity of TCS in zebrafish embryos was assessed. Subsequently, the uptake and biotransformation of TCS by zebrafish embryos were evaluated. A wide-scope targeted metabolomics screening workflow was established to investigate induced toxicity from a biochemical perspective and associate observed toxicity/phenotype with molecular changes. A platform combining RPLC and HILIC with ESI-HRMS was developed to cover the wide polarity range of xeno- and endometabolomes. Suspect and non-target screening workflows were applied to identify biotransformation products. A database of 600 endogenous metabolites was established, covering a broad range of primary metabolism. This approach, unlike classic targeted methods, did not focus on a few metabolic pathways, thereby revealing the involvement of unexpected metabolic pathways.

### P-307: An Omics Approach Towards Identification of Unknown Emerging Pollutants in Marine Waters

**Presenting Author:** Steve Huysman, Ghent University, Belgium  
**Co-Authors:** Francis Vanryckeghem, Kristof Demeestere, Lynn Vanhaecke

**Abstract:**
The prevalence of emerging organic micropollutants in aquatic environments poses significant risks to public and ecological health. Despite this, current legislation focuses mainly on a few priority pollutants, missing many known and unknown compounds in water. This study presents a novel analytical strategy for identifying structurally related emerging organic pollutants in marine waters. In-house developed and validated UHPLC-HR-Q-Orbitrap-MS methods targeting 70 steroids and 27 plasticizers were used to detect 1,292 unique unknown emerging organic pollutants in 24 seawater samples from the Belgian part of the North Sea. Target standards were fragmented at 35 and 20 eV to elucidate typical fragmentation profiles and identify characteristic fragments. A newly written Python code screened the generated fragments for agreement with characteristic fragments and neutral losses from target standards. In total, 173 (13%) unknowns were tentatively identified, including 125 steroids, 21 alkylphenols, and 27 phthalates, at a confidence level of Tier 3. Untargeted screening of seawater samples confirmed the successful detection of all target analytes, indicating that fragmentation occurred even in a salty matrix.

### P-309: Lipid Changes in Different Tissues of Rats After Chronic Exposure to Ambient Fine Particulate Matter

**Presenting Author:** Ting-Zhen Chen, Institute of Environmental Health, National Taiwan University, Taiwan  
**Co-Authors:** Hao-Jan Liang, Sheng-Han Lee, Wen-Ling Chen, Tsun-Jen Cheng, Ching-Yu Lin

**Abstract:**
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can pass the respiratory barrier and enter the circulatory system, potentially affecting various organs. PM2.5-induced toxicity is associated with oxidative stress, which may lead to lipid perturbation. Previous studies using a lipidomic platform found that PM2.5 exposure significantly altered phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels in rat lungs, potentially impairing pulmonary surfactant functions. However, the lipid effects of PM2.5 on other organs remain unclear. In this study, we examined the lipid effects of chronic PM2.5 exposure on various organs using a rat inhalation model. Five male rats were exposed to ambient air containing PM2.5 for 8 months, while five control rats were exposed to filtered air. Blood and tissue samples from the heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, testis, and epididymis were collected and analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PLS-DA models revealed altered patterns of phosphorylcholine-containing lipids in the testis, pancreas, heart, liver, and kidney of PM2.5-exposed rats. Numerous phosphorylcholine-containing lipid species associated with exposure were identified, and decreased PC(16:0/18:1) was observed in both serum and testis. Further studies are needed to verify potential biomarkers for PM2.5 exposure.

### P-310: Metabolomics-Based Biomarker Discovery for Bee Health Monitoring: A Proof of Concept Study Concerning Diagnosis of Nutritional Stress in Bombus terrestris

**Presenting Author:** Luoluo Wang, Ghent University, Belgium  
**Co-Authors:** Ivan Meeus, Caroline Rombouts, Lieven Van Meulebroek, Lynn Vanhaecke, Guy Smagghe

**Abstract:**
Bee pollinators are exposed to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors. Understanding the effects of a single stressor in the complex environmental context is crucial for pollinator monitoring and early warning systems. This study aimed to improve the diagnosis of bee stressors using a simultaneous untargeted and targeted metabolomics-based approach. Analysis of 84 *Bombus terrestris* hemolymph samples identified eight metabolites as potential biomarkers for nutritional stress, showing excellent discrimination. Additionally, eight significantly altered metabolites, as revealed by targeted profiling, were also assigned as candidate biomarkers. Machine learning algorithms applied to these biomarker sets showed that the untargeted eight components had the best classification performance, with sensitivity and specificity up to 99% and 100%, respectively. Pathway and biochemistry analysis suggested that gluconeogenesis contributed significantly to blood sugar stability in bumblebees maintained on a low carbohydrate diet. This study demonstrates the potential of metabolomics-based biomarker discovery for improving bee health monitoring and identifying stressors related to energy intake and other environmental factors.

### P-311: iNVERTOX: Characterising Background Metabolomic Variability and Subsequent Alteration in the Freshwater Invertebrate, Gammarus pulex, Upon Exposure to Psychoactive Pharmaceuticals

**Presenting Author:** Thomas Miller, King’s College London, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** James I. MacRae, Nicolas R. Bury, Stewart F. Owen, Leon P. Barron

**Abstract:**
The persistence of emerging contaminants in the environment poses a risk to exposed organisms. 'Omics technologies are powerful tools in environmental toxicology for understanding these exposure scenarios. However, interpreting metabolite data to understand toxicological responses is challenging. Establishing the variability in individual metabolomes, or the "background metabolome," is essential to determine possible confounding factors such as age, sex, and moulting. This study characterized the effect of these factors on the metabolic variability in the freshwater invertebrate, *G. pulex*. An analytical method for the extraction and non-target analysis of the metabolome in *G. pulex* was developed, involving dual-phase liquid extraction followed by HILIC-HRMS. Animals collected from the field were analyzed immediately and compared to those acclimatized to laboratory conditions or exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of antidepressants. Results indicated that biological sex, moulting stage, and acclimatization period affected metabolic variability. Pre-selecting animals based on these factors can reduce inherent variability in the data. Overall, characterizing metabolic variance and using metabolomics provides a powerful approach for understanding adverse effects associated with environmental contaminants.

### P-312: Characterization of Aerosol Deposition on Human Organotypic Respiratory Epithelial Tissue Exposed at the Air-Liquid Interface and Metabolism Assessment

**Presenting Author:** Sandra Sendyk, Associate Scientist, Switzerland  
**Co-Authors:** Jeseena Sabaratnam, Shoaib Majeed, Laura Ortega Torres, Stefan Frentzel, Anita Iskandar, Julia Hoeng, Arno Knorr, Catherine Goujon

**Abstract:**
Human organotypic respiratory epithelial tissue cultures are used for in vitro toxicological assessments of cigarette smoke (CS) and aerosol from smoke-free products. Metabolism of deposited compounds is critical for assessing their bioavailability and potential toxicity. Nicotine, a common marker of exposure, has a well-established metabolism pathway. CS is a complex mixture of over 6,000 compounds, many of which have known toxicological effects. A multi-compound method using dual-column liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry was established to quantify nicotine and its major metabolites in extracts of organotypic respiratory epithelial tissue cultures following exposure to CS and aerosol from smoke-free products for 112 puffs. Quantification was performed using stable isotope-labeled internal standards. Three major nicotine metabolites, representing approximately 1% of the deposited nicotine, were identified. Additional exposure markers correlated with nicotine were investigated to better understand the deposition of aerosols and CS on organotypic respiratory epithelial tissue cultures.

### P-313: Toxicity and Metabolomics of Zebrafish Exposed to Per- and Polyfluorinated Alkylated Substances and Alternatives to Select More Environmentally Friendly Compounds

**Presenting Author:** Pim Leonards, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Jessica Legradi

**Abstract:**
Per- and polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) have been widely used as organic surfactants in industrial and consumer products. Their properties make PFASs very persistent in the environment. This study performed a chemical alternatives assessment using metabolomics between PFOA and PFOS and alternative chemicals to select more environmentally friendly compounds. Zebrafish embryos (*Danio rerio*) were chronically and acutely exposed to PFOA, PFOS, and alternatives (PFHxS, PFBS, siloxanes, and GenX) to study the mechanism of toxicity. No significant effects on mortality, visual developmental abnormalities, or swimming activity were observed. Transcription of the DNA damage gene was significantly up-regulated by over 2-fold relative to the control for PFOA, PFHxS, PFOS, and GenX. The lipid metabolism gene was up-regulated by over 2-fold in embryos exposed to PFOS and GenX. Metabolomics data showed regulation of many lipids (PC, PE, TAG, SM). GENX, as an alternative to PFOA, displayed a similar activity pattern to PFASs. The alternatives D4, D5, and TMS appeared to have a lower impact on metabolic pathways (e.g., lipids) than PFOA.

### P-314: Pre- and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Pollutants Alters Lipid and Polar Metabolite Profiles in Non-Obese Diabetic Mice

**Presenting Author:** Tim Sinioja, Örebro University, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Johanna Bodin, Aidan McGlinchey, Daniel Duberg, Hubert Dirven, Hanne Friis Berntsen, Karin Zimmer, Unni Cecilie Nygaard, Matej Orešič, Tuulia Hyötyläinen

**Abstract:**
Chronic non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, cause up to 60% of annual global mortality. These diseases are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. External exposure to environmental contaminants affects internal exposure, such as metabolism, which mediates risks of various diseases. However, little is known about how chemical pollutant exposure affects the metabolome. In this project, we explored lipid and metabolic changes in mice pre- and postnatally exposed to a mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) containing organochlorides, organobromides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Lipidomic profiling of mouse blood serum samples was conducted using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, while polar metabolite profiling was conducted using GC-Q-TOF/MS. Significant changes in lipid and polar metabolite profiles were observed between control and treatment groups. The largest difference in metabolite regulation was detected between the control and high exposure group. Many phospholipids and several triglycerides containing polyunsaturated fatty acids were downregulated, while tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites were upregulated. Our findings suggest that the alteration of the lipid profile in mice exposed to the POP mixture is similar to previously reported metabolic changes associated with a higher risk of type 1 diabetes.

### P-315: High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry for Monitoring Physiological Impacts and Biotransformation Products in Fish Exposed to Wastewater Effluent

**Presenting Author:** Ioanna Ntai, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Jonathan Mosley, Marina Evich, Drew Ekman, Jenna Cavallin, Dan Villeneuve, Gerald Ankley, Tim Collette

**Abstract:**
High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is advantageous for metabolomics analyses and monitoring contaminant biotransformation products in fish exposed to wastewater effluent. In this study, male and female fathead minnows were exposed to wastewater effluent using an onsite, flow-through system at the Western Lake Superior Sanitary District (WLSSD) wastewater treatment plant in Duluth, MN, USA. Metabolomic changes in liver tissue and skin mucus were measured for fish exposed for 21 days to control water or control water mixed with treated wastewater effluent at 5%, 20%, or 100% effluent levels. Skin mucus metabolomic changes reflected processes by which the fish biotransformed xenobiotics in the effluent. Regression models built with liver data provided evidence that xenobiotic transformation processes were induced, with sex-specific responses. The detection of sex-specific phase II transformation products (e.g., glucuronidated bisphenol A) in fish skin mucus led to the development of a novel untargeted method to identify glucuronidated biotransformation products in fish bile. Using traditional enzyme hydrolysis, HRMS-based untargeted metabolomics, and a structure-specific neutral loss-dependent MS3 fragmentation method with a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid mass spectrometer, this method was demonstrated using bile from treated wastewater effluent-exposed fish, providing a means of screening for relevant contaminants in complex environmental mixtures.

### P-316: 1H-NMR Metabolomics Study of Arabidopsis thaliana Exposure to PFOA and PFOS

**Presenting Author:** Liam O’Hara, University of Guelph, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Julie Konzuk, James Longstaffe

**Abstract:**
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants originating from their use in industrial surfactants, textile finishes, and flame retardants. Their persistence poses ecological and health risks due to bioaccumulation. Non-targeted metabolomics provides a way to determine subtle responses in plants when exposed to these compounds at environmental levels. This poster presents new work exploring the application of non-targeted metabolomics using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to understand the effects of PFOA and PFOS contamination on *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to determine the variation in metabolic profiles in *A. thaliana* in response to PFOA and PFOS contamination. This method could be used on a wide range of species to determine whether they show signs of exposure to PFOA or PFOS at levels that may otherwise be difficult to monitor.

### P-317: Quantitation of Glyphosate and AMPA from Microbiome Reactor Fluids

**Presenting Author:** Beatrice Engelmann, Department of Molecular Systems Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Katarina Fritz-Wallace, Stephanie S. Schäpe, Jannike L. Krause, Judith Pöppe, Gunda Herberth, Uwe Rösler, Nico Jehmlich, Martin v. Bergen, Ulrike Rolle-Kampczyk

**Abstract:**
Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides and can affect the intestinal microbiota by inhibiting the shikimate pathway, which is also used by bacteria. Chemostat cultivation of intestinal microbiota is increasingly used as a model system, necessitating methods for quantifying glyphosate and its degradation product, AMPA. An optimized protocol for the analysis of both compounds by simple extraction with methanol:acetonitrile:water (2:3:1) was established, omitting further enrichment steps. Glyphosate and AMPA were separated by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and identified with a targeted MS/MS method on a QTRAP 5500 system. The limit of detection (LOD) in extracted water samples was < 2 ng/mL for both compounds. In complex intestinal medium, the LOD was 2 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively. This method was used to determine the glyphosate concentration in a bioreactor model of swine colon and is compatible with the extraction protocol for untargeted metabolomics analysis. The approach presented here allows the quantitation of glyphosate and AMPA in bioreactor fluids, enabling studies on the metabolization of glyphosate and its impact on the intestinal microbiota.

### P-318: Metabolomics Approach to Study the Environmental Impact and Residues of Biocontrol Products (BP)

**Presenting Author:** Mélina Ramos, PLS Université Paris: EPHE-UPVD-CNRS, USR 3278 CRIOBE, Université de Perpignan, France  
**Co-Authors:** Marie-Virginie Salvia, Delphine Raviglione, Mercè Llugany, Esther Badosa, Emilio Montesinos, Cédric Bertrand

**Abstract:**
Biopesticides or biocontrol products (BP) represent an interesting alternative to conventional pesticides. However, there is a need for technical efficacy studies and ecotoxicological profile references. The half-life (t1/2) is often used to study the fate of pesticides in environmental matrices, but it does not provide information on by-product formation and biodiversity effects. An innovative approach based on metabolomics (LC-MS), the Environmental Metabolic Footprinting (EMF), was recently developed. EMF provides a new integrative proxy, resilience, which corresponds to the time needed for compound dissipation and its effects on the matrix (meta-metabolome). EMF can also be used to determine the preharvest interval (PHI), the time needed to have no residue (xenometabolome) difference between the treated sample and the control. The degradation of BP on vine leaves was monitored. Vines were treated against powdery mildew with two fungicide BPs. Vine leaves were sampled at different time points to study BP degradation kinetics. Extraction steps were optimized, and the extracts were analyzed using a UHPLC-HRMS instrument. Preliminary results showed a degradation kinetics for the two fungicide BPs with a PHI between 4 and 10 days. The endometabolome is currently being analyzed. The project will last three years, and the same study will be repeated and extended to other matrices.
