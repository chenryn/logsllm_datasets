## Abstract
Password reuse has long been recognized as a security vulnerability, allowing attackers to use credentials stolen from one site to gain access to another. This paper introduces a measurement technique that leverages this phenomenon to infer site compromises. We describe a system, called Tripwire, which registers unique honey accounts on third-party websites and monitors associated email accounts for unauthorized access, providing indirect evidence of credential theft. In a pilot study monitoring over 2,300 sites for a year, we detected 19 site compromises, including a plaintext password breach at a top-500 Alexa site with more than 45 million active users.

## Introduction
Online information services, such as email, social networks, and e-commerce platforms, rely on usernames and passwords for user authentication. Attackers seeking to compromise these accounts need only acquire the user's credentials. While there are various methods to compromise account credentials, one of the most significant threats arises from data breaches and password reuse. When a site is compromised, exposing user accounts and passwords, attackers can use these credentials to access other accounts where the same credentials are used. This is exacerbated by the common practice of using an email address as a username.

Recent studies estimate that over 40% of users reuse passwords, and up to 20% of stolen credentials may share a password with their primary email account. Data breaches are increasingly common, with reports of millions of account credentials being stolen from major platforms like LinkedIn and MySpace. The market for stolen credentials is thriving, with bulk sales of credentials available for under a penny each. These credentials are valuable because they can be used across multiple sites, enabling account compromise even on sites not directly affected by the original breach.

Email accounts, especially those from major providers like Gmail, Live/Hotmail, and Yahoo, are particularly sensitive. Access to an email account can provide access to a wide array of other services, as online services often require email addresses for registration, communication, and password recovery. While email accounts are frequently compromised, only a few major providers have had public breaches.

Addressing the password reuse problem is challenging. While solutions like password managers and two-factor authentication can help, they require significant changes in user behavior. Most providers respond reactively, resetting accounts when a breach is known. However, many breaches may go undetected, and attackers are incentivized to keep them secret. Given this, it is crucial to detect when credential breaches occur, opening up other sites to password reuse attacks.

In this paper, we describe a technique for inferring the occurrence of such breaches without requiring special access to internet sites or their infrastructure. Our approach, implemented in a system called Tripwire, detects site compromises externally by registering honey accounts with unique email addresses and shared passwords. If any of these email accounts is accessed, it provides strong evidence of a compromise at the corresponding site. We conducted a pilot study covering approximately 2,300 sites and discovered evidence of 19 previously undisclosed breaches, including one at a large publicly-traded company with over 45 million active customers.

The remainder of this paper discusses related work, ethical considerations, our methodology, and the effectiveness of our pilot monitoring. We also report on our experience disclosing findings to affected sites and the challenges in scaling such a service.

## Related Work
The Tripwire technique relies on attackers stealing email account credentials from one site and using shared passwords to access the email provider. Researchers have found that users often reuse passwords across multiple services, making it likely that attackers will exploit this behavior to take over additional, potentially more valuable accounts. Previous work has focused on detecting vulnerable sites, defending against attacks, and evaluating the risk of compromise. However, Tripwire offers an advantage by being deployable and operated by a third party, detecting both online and offline attacks, and relying only on the integrity of a major, independent email provider.

Honeypot accounts have been used to observe attacker behavior and detect compromises, but Tripwire is the first to use honeypots where no part of the system under measurement needs to be trusted.

## Ethical Considerations
Before detailing our system and methodology, it is important to discuss the ethics and potential for harm associated with our study. We obtained full consent and cooperation from our partner email provider but did not seek consent from the websites we monitored. Seeking prior consent could introduce bias and compromise the scientific validity of our study. We do not undertake our study lightly and have considered the potential direct and indirect harms.

Direct harm is limited to the small amounts of storage and load associated with account registration. Indirect harms include potential damage to the brand or reputation of sites if breaches become known. To mitigate this, we obscure the identity of compromised sites. We also attempted to notify the operators of all sites where we detected compromise.

Our passive monitoring approach provides concrete evidence of a compromise but no information about the exploit or mechanism. This can place notified site operators in a challenging position, as disclosing a compromise or forcing a password reset can drive users away. Legal risks were minimized, and there are no human subject concerns as all information provided is fictitious.

## Methodology
Tripwire consists of two distinct phases: account registration and monitoring. We designed an automated web crawler to register accounts and partnered with a major email provider to monitor activity at the associated email accounts.

### Account and Identity Management
Tripwire ensures each account maintains a one-to-one mapping to an identity, consisting of an email address and password, with additional information as required. Identities are designed to look organic, with full names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and employers. We generate plausible usernames and email addresses, ensuring they are unlikely to be taken. Passwords are either "hard" (random alpha-numeric, mixed-case, ten-character strings) or "easy" (eight-character strings combining a dictionary word and a digit).

### Interaction with the Email Provider
We approached our email provider to create accounts for our system. The provider was not aware of which accounts were used on what services. All email accounts were created with corresponding names and forwarded any mail received to our own mail server. The email provider also notifies us of any successful logins, providing timestamp, remote IP, and method for any successful logins, but not failed attempts.

In the next sections, we will detail our findings and the challenges in scaling such a service.
