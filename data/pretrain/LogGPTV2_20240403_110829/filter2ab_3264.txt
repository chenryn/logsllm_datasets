**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Audit

### Description
Review changes to the cron schedule. Cron job execution logs can typically be found in the `/var/log` directory. To confirm the exact location of the cron log file, check the syslog configuration at either `/etc/rsyslog.conf` or `/etc/syslog.conf`.

### Steps to Review Cron Schedule Changes
1. **Locate Cron Logs:**
   - Navigate to the `/var/log` directory.
   - Look for files such as `cron`, `syslog`, or `messages` that may contain cron job execution logs.

2. **Verify Log File Location:**
   - Check the syslog configuration file:
     - For `rsyslog`, open `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.
     - For `syslog-ng`, open `/etc/syslog.conf`.
   - Search for lines that specify the logging destination for cron jobs. These lines often include keywords like `cron.*` or `*.cron`.

3. **Review Log Entries:**
   - Examine the log entries to identify any recent changes to the cron schedule.
   - Look for entries that indicate new cron jobs, modifications to existing jobs, or unusual activity.

By following these steps, you can effectively audit and monitor changes to the cron schedule, ensuring system integrity and security.
