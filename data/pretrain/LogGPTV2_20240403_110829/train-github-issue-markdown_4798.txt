Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/bonfire-return-largest-
numbers-in-arrays has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and
include links to screenshots if possible.
It doesn't matter what code you write, your get the same error:  
Cannot read property 'eql' of undefined
Even chopping the function call to a straight text string gives the same
error.
