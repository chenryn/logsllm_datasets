### Support Ticket: Soft Wrap Functionality Issues

**Ticket ID:** support/99c4b424c63611e397d244a7153df9be

**Issue Description:**

I am experiencing significant issues with the soft wrap feature. The cursor frequently does not display in the correct position, particularly after performing a find and replace operation. Specifically, the cursor often appears approximately 4 characters away from its actual insertion point. Additionally, some characters become impossible to select or delete.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Enable soft wrap.
2. Perform a find and replace operation.
3. Observe the cursor's misalignment and difficulty in selecting/deleting certain characters.

**Additional Information:**
- I have disabled all my packages, but the wrapping issues persist.
- Refer to the screenshot for a specific example (line 30):

  - In the screenshot, the `data-tooltip-position` attribute should read "bottom left," but the word "bottom" is being cut off.

**Software Version:**
- I am currently using version 0.90.0.
