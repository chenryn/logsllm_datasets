When you build a ZFS storage system you need to invest some time doing the [storage planning](https://mtlynch.io/budget-nas/#storage-planning).
There are many variables that affect the number and type of disks, you first
need to have an idea of what kind of data you want to store and what use are you
going to give to that data.
# Robustness
ZFS is designed to survive disk failures, so it stores each block of data
redundantly. This feature complicates capacity planning because your total
usable storage is not just the sum of each disk’s capacity.
ZFS creates filesystems out of “pools” of disks. The more disks in the pool, the
more efficiently ZFS can use their storage capacity. For example, if you give
ZFS two 10 TB drives, you can only use half of your total disk capacity. If you
instead use five 4 TB drives, ZFS gives you 14 TB of usable storage. Even though
your total disk space is the same in either scenario, the five smaller drives
give you 40% more usable space.
When you’re building a NAS server, you need to decide whether to use a smaller
quantity of large disks or a larger quantity of small disks. Smaller drives are
usually cheaper in terms of $/TB, but they’re more expensive to operate. Two 4
TB drives require twice the electricity of a single 8 TB drive.
Also keep in mind that so far ZFS doesn't let you add a new drive to an existing
vdev, but that
[feature is under active development](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/12225).
If you want to be safe, plan your vdev definition so that they don't need to
change the disk numbers.
## [Preventing concurrent disk failures](https://mtlynch.io/budget-nas/#preventing-concurrent-disk-failures)
Naively, the probability of two disks failing at once seems vanishingly small.
Based on
[Backblaze’s stats](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-hard-drive-stats-for-2020/),
high-quality disk drives fail at 0.5-4% per year. A 4% risk per year is a 0.08%
chance in any given week. Two simultaneous failures would happen once every
30,000 years, so you should be fine, right?
The problem is that disks aren’t statistically independent. If one disk fails,
its neighbor has a substantially higher risk of dying. This is especially true
if the disks are the same model, from the same manufacturing batch, and
processed the same workloads.
Further, rebuilding a ZFS pool puts an unusual amount of strain on all of the
surviving disks. A disk that would have lasted a few more months under normal
usage might die under the additional load of a pool rebuild.
Given these risks, you can reduce the risk of concurrent disk failures by
choosing two different models of disk from two different manufacturers. To
reduce the chances of getting disks from the same manufacturing batch, you can
buy them from different vendors.
# Choosing the disks 
There are many things to take into account when choosing the different disks for your pool.
## Choosing the disks to hold data
Check [diskprices.com](https://www.diskprices.com) to get an idea of the cost of
disks in the market. If you can, try to avoid buying to Amazon as it's the
devil. Try to buy them from a local store instead, that way you interact with a
human and promote a local commerce.
Note: If you want a TL;DR you can jump to the
[conclusion](#data-disk-conclusion).
To choose your disks take into account:
- [Disk speed](#data-disk-speed)
- [Disk load](#data-disk-load)
- [Disk type](#data-disk-type)
- [Disk homogeneity](#data-disk-homogeneity)
- [Disk Warranty](#data-disk-warranty)
- [Disk Brands](#data-disk-brand)
### Data disk speed
When comes to disk speed there are three kinds, the slow (5400 RPM), normal
(7200 RPM) and fast (10k RPM).
The higher the RPM, the louder the disk is, the more heat it creates and the
more power it will consume. In exchange they will have higher writing and
reading speeds. Slower disks expand the lifecycle of the device, but in the case
of a failed disk in a RAID scenario, the rebuild time will be higher than on
faster ones therefore increasing the risk on concurrent failing disks.
Before choosing a high number of RPM make sure that it's your bottleneck, which
usually is the network if you're using a 1Gbps network. In this case a 10k RPM
disk won't offer better performance than a 7200 RPM, even a 7200 one won't be
better than a 5400.
The need of higher speeds can be fixed by using an SSD as a cache for reading
and writing.
### Data disk load
Disk specifications tell you the amount of TB/year they support, it gives you an
idea of the fault tolerance. Some examples
| Disk       | Fault tolerance (TB/year) |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| WD RED 8TB | 180                       |
### [Data disk type](https://www.howtogeek.com/345131/how-to-select-hard-drives-for-your-home-nas/)
It’s easy to think that all hard drives are equal, save for the form factor and
connection type. However, there’s a difference between the work your hard drive
does in your computer versus the workload of a [NAS](nas.md) hard drive. A drive
in your computer may only read and write data for a couple hours at a time,
while a NAS drive may read and write data for weeks on end, or even longer.
The environment inside of a NAS box is much different than a typical desktop or
laptop computer. When you pack in a handful of hard drives close together,
several things happen: there’s more vibration, more heat, and a lot more action
going on in general.
To cope with this, NAS hard drives usually have better vibration tolerance and
produce less heat than regular hard drives, thanks to slightly-slower spindle
speeds and reduced seek noise.
Most popular brands are Western Digital Red and Seagate IronWolf which use 5400
RPM, if you want to go on the 7200 RPM speeds you can buy the Pro version of
each. I initially tried checking
[Backblaze’s hard drive stats](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-q2-2022/)
to avoid failure-prone disks, but they use drives on the pricier side.
The last pitfall to avoid is shingled magnetic recording (SMR) technology. ZFS
[performs poorly on SMR drives](https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/),
so if you’re building a NAS, avoid
[known SMR drives](https://www.truenas.com/community/resources/list-of-known-smr-drives.141/).
If the drive is labeled as CMR, that’s conventional magnetic recording, which is
fine for ZFS.
SMR is well suited for high-capacity, low-cost use where writes are few and
reads are many. It has worse sustained write performance than CMR, which can
cause severe issues during resilvering or other write-intensive operations.
There are three types of SMR:
- Drive Managed, DM-SMR: It's opaque to the OS. This means ZFS cannot "target"
  writes, and is the worst type for ZFS use. As a rule of thumb, avoid DM-SMR
  drives, unless you have a specific use case where the increased resilver time
  (a week or longer) is acceptable, and you know the drive will function for ZFS
  during resilver.
- Host Aware, HA-SMR: It's designed to give ZFS insight into the SMR process.
  Note that ZFS code to use HA-SMR does not appear to exist. Without that code,
  a HA-SMR drive behaves like a DM-SMR drive where ZFS is concerned.
- Host Managed, HM-SMR: It's not backwards compatible and requires ZFS to manage
  the SMR process.
### Data disk homogeneity
It's recommended that all the disks in your pool (or is it by vdev?) have the
same RPM and size.
### Data disk warranty
Disks are going to fail, so it's good to have a good warranty to return them.
### [Data disk brands](https://www.nasmaster.com/best-nas-drives/)
#### [Western Digital](https://www.nasmaster.com/wd-red-vs-red-plus-vs-red-pro-nas-hdd/)
The Western Digital Red series of NAS drives are very similar to Seagate’s
offering and you should consider these if you can find them at more affordable
prices. WD splits its NAS drives into three sub-categories, normal, Plus, and
Pro.
| Specs                  | WD Red    | WD Red Plus        | WD Red Pro      |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Technology             | SMR       | CMR                | CMR             |
| Bays                   | 1-8       | 1-8                | 1-24            |
| Capacity               | 2-6TB     | 1-14TB             | 2-18TB          |
| Speed                  | 5,400 RPM | 5,400 RPM (1-4TB)  | 7200 RPM        |
| Speed                  | 5,400 RPM | 5,640 RPM (6-8TB)  | 7200 RPM        |
