##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
ec2_group
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.1.0
      config file = 
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
install: sudo pip install -U
git+https://github.com/ansible/PI:EMAIL \--upgrade
--ignore-installed six
##### CONFIGURATION
default ansible.cfg
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
OS X El Capitan 10.11.6  
Multi VPC AWS environment. Peers between VPC's w/appropriate routing between
them
##### SUMMARY
ec2_group does not allow group_name to use groups via group name from other
peered VPC's. This worked in v1.9.6 and v2.0.2. It appears to be due to some
additional conditions that were added on 7/27/16. If I revert this change, it
works as expected.
`0419914`
Using group_id with the name of the security group in a different VPC works
but is not idempotent. It will create the rule if it's new but will fail if it
already exists.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Attempt to use a AWS security group name from another VPC with required
peering present using group_name:
    - name: Provision Security Groups
      ec2_group:
        name: MyGroup
        description: MyDesc
        region: us-east-1
        vpc_id: vpc-xxxxxxxx
        rules:
           - proto: tcp
              from_port: 22
              to_port: 22
              group_name:

        description: MyDesc

        vpc_id: vpc-xxxxxxxx
        rules:
           - proto: tcp
              from_port: 22
              to_port: 22
              group_id: 
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Translate group name to group ID (sg-xxxxxxxx) and update rule with the
security group ID of the other VPC's security group.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
The group in the peered VPC is not found and an attempt to create a new group
in the current VPC is executed. In my case, this fails due to "no description"
Message using group_name with security group name from a different VPC
    "msg": "group  will be automatically created by rule {'to_port': 22, 'from_port': 22, 'group_name': '', 'proto': 'tcp'} and no description was provided"
Message using group_id with security group name from a different VPC if the
rule exists. If the rule does not exist, it is added as expected.
