## Abstract
This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the primary research directions in identity management and identity-related security threats in Online Social Networks (OSNs). The increasing number and sophistication of fake accounts pose significant risks to the privacy and security of genuine OSN users. Uninformed users may unknowingly accept friendship requests from these fake accounts, thereby granting them access to personal information intended for real friends. Additionally, these fake accounts can compromise system security by spreading malware, engaging in malicious activities such as sexual harassment or child abuse, and generally eroding trust in the social computing environment. The tutorial introduces key research findings in this area and presents our work on collaborative identity validation techniques to estimate the trustworthiness of OSN profiles.

## 1. Introduction
Identity management in Online Social Networks (OSNs) is a critical component of their security. The ability to reliably identify a profile on an OSN is the first step towards protecting both users and their data, as well as the OSN provider's resources and reputation. However, this capability is not easily achieved or provided in today’s major OSNs. The ease with which a digital identity (i.e., a profile) can be obtained, often requiring only a valid email account, facilitates open socializing but also exposes these platforms to identity-related attacks and threats.

The percentage of fake accounts in major OSNs is continuously increasing, despite efforts to detect them. For example, the percentage of fake accounts on Facebook rose from 5.5% in 2012 to about 12% in 2015.1

A substantial body of research focuses on detecting fake accounts in OSNs, primarily under the topic of Sybil detection. A Sybil account represents a forged identity created at scale by bots or manually, with common malicious aims such as spreading malware, spying on user activity, stealing personal information, or disseminating fake content. Sybil detection algorithms aim to differentiate between fake and real accounts based on behavior and network features, or after detected malicious activity.

Generally, most Sybil detection methods fall into two main categories: graph-based and behavior-based approaches. Graph-based methods assume that Sybil nodes exhibit different connection patterns compared to real ones, while behavior-based methods rely on the premise that Sybil nodes behave in ways that are distinguishable from honest activity. However, Sybil accounts are becoming more sophisticated and are increasingly targeting the trust of honest users, making traditional detection methods less effective.

To address this issue, we have explored identity validation solutions from a social, collaborative perspective. We have investigated how the collective wisdom of honest users in a social network can be harnessed to analyze new profiles based on their content. Our findings indicate that honest profiles exhibit content correlations that can be learned using crowdsourcing and unsupervised decentralized machine learning techniques, and these correlations can be effectively used to flag fake profiles early on.

## 2. Sybil Detection
Given the importance of detecting Sybils, the literature offers a wide range of related research. These works can be categorized into two main types: graph-based Sybil detection and behavior-based Sybil detection.

### Graph-Based Sybil Detection
Graph-based methods focus on topological structures of the social network graph, where Sybil accounts tend to exhibit different connection patterns compared to real accounts. For instance, studies such as [19], [18], [17], [4], [5], and [1] have shown that Sybil accounts mix faster in the graph compared to real accounts.

### Behavior-Based Sybil Detection
Behavior-based methods concentrate on detecting behavioral features related to account activities in the social network. Sybil accounts often exhibit distinct patterns in features such as the frequency of sending friend requests, names structures, and the ratio of outgoing to incoming activity. Examples include [16], [15], and [13]. Additionally, some studies adopt a hybrid approach, combining both graph-based and behavioral-based features, such as [6], [8], and [9].

These automated techniques face challenges due to the continuous sophistication of Sybil accounts, which adapt to the detection features and can mimic normal behavior. To overcome these limitations, incorporating the human factor as a second layer of protection remains one of the most effective solutions, as argued in [14].

## 3. Identity Validation
While automated Sybil detection techniques are crucial, collaborative identity validation is also important as an additional layer of protection against more sophisticated Sybil accounts. Identity validation involves labeling accounts with metrics that represent their estimated trustworthiness in the social network, as perceived by general users.

We have conducted several research works on this topic. In [2], we proposed a semi-supervised learning strategy to detect correlations between attributes in a profile schema, which were then used to parse new profiles and evaluate their coherence compared to other real profiles. In [3], we demonstrated how these correlations can be learned in a privacy-preserving manner using anonymization techniques. In [10] and [11], we achieved similar outcomes using fully unsupervised learning within a decentralized architecture, where each user is aware only of their direct friends. Our findings indicate that profile trustworthiness depends on the social community they belong to, as members of each community tend to exhibit local profile patterns that are difficult for Sybils to mimic.

## 4. Conclusion
Fighting against Sybil accounts in online social networks is an ongoing challenge, with detector mechanisms and attackers in a constant race. Understanding and mitigating identity-related threats and vulnerabilities, especially in open social networks where it is easy to create new profiles, is essential for ensuring reliable and safe social computing environments. This tutorial aims to provide an understanding of these threats, the existing work in the field, and potential research directions.
