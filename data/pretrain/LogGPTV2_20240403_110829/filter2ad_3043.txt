ABSTRACT
This tutorial provides a thorough review of the main research di-
rections in the field of identity management and identity related
security threats in Online Social Networks (OSNs). The continuous
increase in the numbers and sophistication levels of fake accounts
constitutes a big threat to the privacy and to the security of honest
OSN users. Uninformed OSN users could be easily fooled into ac-
cepting friendship links with fake accounts, giving them by that
access to personal information they intend to exclusively share with
their real friends. Moreover, these fake accounts subvert the secu-
rity of the system by spreading malware, connecting with honest
users for nefarious goals such as sexual harassment or child abuse,
and make the social computing environment mostly untrustworthy.
The tutorial introduces the main available research results avail-
able in this area, and presents our work on collaborative identity
validation techniques to estimate OSN profiles trustworthiness.

1 INTRODUCTION
Identity management in the realms of Online Social Networks
(OSNs) is one of the most critical elements in discussing their secu-
rity. The ability to reliably identify a profile on an OSN is the first
building block towards ensuring the protection of both the users
(and their data), and the OSN provider’s resources and reputation.
Unfortunately, this ability is not easily achieved, and/or is not pro-
vided in today’s major OSNs. The looseness in obtaining a digital
identity (i.e., a profile) on an OSN, where only a valid email account

is required, facilitates their joining as open socializing platforms,
but also makes them exposed to identity related attacks and threats.
As a matter of fact, the percentage of fake accounts existing in
today’s major OSNs is continuously increasing regardless of the
efforts put into detecting them, and is reported to have increased
from 5.5% in 2012 to about 12% in 2015 on Facebook, for instance.1
There is a huge body of work in the area of detecting fake ac-
counts in OSNs, mostly under the research topic known as Sybil
detection [7]. A Sybil account represents a forged fake identity that
could have been one of million others created, at scale, by a bot, or
manually at a smaller scale, but with generally common malicious
aims, such as spreading malware, spying on users activity and/or
stealing their personal information, or infecting the environment
with fake content. Sybil detection algorithms aim at discriminating
between fake and real accounts based on Sybils behavior and/or
features in the network, or after they have demonstrated detected
malicious activity.
Generally, most works on Sybil detection adopt one of two main
appraoches. The first one is a graph based appraoch, which assumes
that Sybil nodes exhibit different connection patterns in the social
network compared to real ones. The second approach relies on
a behavioral premise, assuming that Sybil nodes behave in ways
that are easily differentiable from honest activity. However, Sybil
accounts are getting more sophisticated and are moving towards
getting social: i.e., Sybil accounts target misleading as many honest
users as possible into befriending them, gaining as such their trust
in the network and looking as good profiles to detection mecha-
nisms. Moreover, when Sybils succeed at befriending honest users,
the privacy of these latters is at stake as personal information that
is supposed to be shared with real friends becomes available to
fake entities that might have malicious intentions (such as spread-
ing malware, engaging in sexual embarrassment or child abuse
activities, etc.).
To address this issue, we have worked on exploring identity
validation solutions from a social, collaborative perspective. We
have explored how the collective wisdom of honest users in a so-
cial network could be explored to analyze new profiles based only
on the content they contain. We have found that honest profiles
exhibit content correlations that could be learned, both using crowd-
sourcing techniques [2][3], and using unsuprevised decentralized
machine learning techniques [10] [12] [11], and that could be ef-
fectively used to flag fake profiles early on, based only on their
content.

topic of Sybil detection in OSNs, to its main techniques, and to
the challenges facing it. A synthesis of the related literature will
shed the light on the main adopted techniques and on the main
challenges facing this research field. The main focus would be on
user-centric and community-sourced identity validation techniques,
as a promising approach to face social Sybil threats. The main goal
would be to open new research directions and questions under this
important area.
2 SYBIL DETECTION
Given the importance of the problem of detecting Sybils, the litera-
ture has a plethora of related research works. In general, these could
be discussed under two main categories: 1) graph-based Sybil de-
tection, and 2) behavior-based Sybil decetion. For the first category,
the focus is on observations made from topological structures of
the underlying social network graph, showing that Sybil accounts
exhibit connection patterns that could be differentiable from real
ones. For instance, works such as [19][18], [17], [4], [5], and [1]
have leveraged on the observation that Sybil accounts tend to mix
much faster in the graph compared to real accounts.
Under the second category, the focus is more on detecting be-
havioral features related to accounts activities in the social network
for which Sybil accounts exhibit clearly differnetiable patterns com-
pared to real users. For instance, features related to the frequency
of sending friend requests and frequency of making new friends
(e.g., [16]), to accounts names structures (e.g., [15]) or to the ratio of
outgoing to incoming activity and clickstream in the network (e.g.,
[13]), or combinations of these have been explored. In addition to
that, there is also a third category that adopts a hybrid approach
and tries to use both graph-based and behavioral-based features,
such as the works in [6], [8], or in [9].
These automated techniques for Sybil detection face challenges
mostly related to the countinuous sophisitication of Sybil accounts
that adapt themselves to the used features and can manage to look
or to behave as normal acounts do. To overcome these limitations,
the exploitation of the human factor, as a second layer of protection,
remains one of the most effective solutions, such as argued in [14].
3 IDENTITY VALIDATION
Without denying the importance of automated Sybil detection tech-
niques, collaborative identity validation is also important as an-
other layer of protection against more sophisticated Sybil accounts.
Identity validation refers to labelling accounts with metrics that
represent their estimated trustworthiness in the social network,
mostly as perceived by the general users. We have conducted sev-
eral research works on this topic, starting by a crowd-sourcing
based technique for analyzing social network profiles and detect-
ing those looking uncoherent and suspicsious compared to normal
trends exhibited in mormal profiles [2]. In [2], we have proposed a
semi-supervised learning strategy to detect correlations between
attributes in a profile schema. The learned correlations were later
used to parse new profiles and detect the levels of coherence they
exhibit compared to other real profiles among the social group they
try to connect with.
In [3], we have shown how the learning of correlations between
profile attributes and the evaluation of new profiles for coherence
can be achieved in a privacy preserving manner, uwing anonymiza-
tion techniques. Then, in [10] and [11] we have achieved the same
outcome using fully unsupervised learning within a fully dence-
tralized architecture where every user in the social network is only
aware of her/his direct friends. We have also found that profiles
trustworthiness depends on the social community they belong to.
That is, it might be easier for a Sybil account to sophisticate the
account to generally look real, but it can be detected within given
social communities, as members of each community tend to exhibit
hidden local profile patterns that can rather not be easily detected
by Sybils.
4 CONCLUSION
Fighting against Sybil accounts in online social networks is a dual
infinite race between detector mechanisms and the designers of the
attacks. Understanding and containing identity related threats and
vulnerabilities, especially in open general social networks where it
is easy to sign up for a new profile, remains of utmost importance
in ensuring environments of reliable information and safe social
computing. The aim of this tutorial is to provide an understanding
of these threats, of the existing work in the field, and to highlight
the possible research direction that can be undertaken.
