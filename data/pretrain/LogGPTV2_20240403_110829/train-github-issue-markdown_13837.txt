### System info
  * Playwright Version: v1.30.0
  * Operating System: Ubuntu 20
  * Browser: WebKit
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Link to the GitHub repository with the repro**
https://github.com/ta834n/playwright-webkit-demo
**Steps**
  * check out the repository
  * `npm install`
  * `npx playwright install`
  * `npx playwright test` // this will create the initial screenshots
  * `npx playwright test` // this will compare the screenshots
  * repeat the last step (1 out of 5 times the tests will fail)
**Expected**
I expect all tests made with `toMatchSnapshot` to pass no matter how often I
execute them.
**Actual**
  * tests made with `toMatchSnapshot` fail irregularly
  * tests made with `toHaveScreenshot` pass all the time
