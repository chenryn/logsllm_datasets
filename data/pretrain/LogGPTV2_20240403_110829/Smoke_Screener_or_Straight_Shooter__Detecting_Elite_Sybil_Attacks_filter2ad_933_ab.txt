### Challenges in the Latest URSNs

The most recent User-Generated Review Social Networks (URSNs) present a significant challenge: they often include fake content interspersed with genuine information. This practice, despite its inaccuracies, is widely popular and supported by many high-level organizers, leading to a substantial impact for which there are currently no effective countermeasures. In this paper, we address and detect a new type of Sybil attack in URSNs, using Dianping as our case study.

### Introduction to Definitions

To precisely formulate our problem, we introduce the following definitions:

**Definition III.1. Store:**
A Store \( S \) has an official website on Dianping that contains a large number of reviews for that particular store.

**Definition III.2. Community:**
A Community \( C \) is a group of users who post reviews in similar stores to rate and comment on those stores.

**Remark III.3.**
In our paper, we categorize all communities into two types: benign communities and Sybil communities. A benign community consists of all real, normal users, while a Sybil community is formed by malicious users. We use the terms "benign users" and "real users" interchangeably, and "Sybil users" refer to individuals who post fake reviews to boost the prestige of stores.

**Definition III.4. Campaign:**
A campaign—denoted as \( (C, S, T_s, T_e) \), where \( C \), \( S \), \( T_s \), and \( T_e \) denote community ID, store ID, starting time, and ending time of a campaign—is an activity in which users of a Community \( C \) post reviews in Store \( S \) from \( T_s \) to \( T_e \) to enhance the reputation of Store \( S \).

**Remark III.5.**
For Sybil users in a given community, these users serve multiple stores. Each store has a specific campaign launched by the community, but these stores can also have other campaigns launched by different communities.

### Elite Sybil Users

In the context of Dianping, we identify a new type of Sybil user, termed "elite Sybil users." Unlike regular Sybil users, elite Sybil users post reviews that do not appear to be part of Sybil tasks, thereby significantly reducing the accuracy of existing detection systems. Elite Sybil accounts can be categorized into two types:
1. **Smoke-Screening Accounts:** These are Sybil accounts that create reviews not related to Sybil tasks to mimic genuine users.
2. **Converted Benign Accounts:** These are accounts owned by benign users, usually with high ratings, that convert to Sybil accounts when performing a Sybil task within a campaign to receive rewards from Sybil organizations.

Although elite Sybil accounts belong to multiple users or entities, they are controlled by a single entity (the Sybil leader). This fits the definition of a Sybil attack, where a malicious entity assumes multiple identities. By hiding behind a large number of seemingly reasonable reviews, elite Sybil users' posts appear realistic, making them more active outside of Sybil campaigns and resulting in a lower percentage of fake reviews and higher user-level star ratings.

### Black Market and Economic Factors

We explore the monetary rewards for elite Sybil users on Dianping. Table I shows the hierarchical rewards for a specific Sybil organization we infiltrated. The rewards increase with the account ratings, as higher-rated users have a larger influence and their reviews are less likely to be deleted, making them more attractive to Sybil organizers.

| Account Ratings | Rewards per Submission |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 0-star, 1-star  | $0.30                  |
| 2-star          | $0.75                  |
| 3-star          | $1.50                  |
| 4-star          | $3.74                  |
| 5-star, 6-star  | $5.98                  |

### Anatomy of Elite Sybil Attack Operations

Many review websites, including Dianping, suffer from review manipulation, a variant of Sybil attacks. To investigate these organizations, we impersonated Sybil users, adhering to ethical considerations by not performing any real tasks. Sybil leaders often post contact information on social media to attract workers. During our investigation, we found a unique organizational pattern on Dianping, involving four key actors:

1. **Customers (Overhyped Stores):** Businesses that want to boost their scores rapidly on Dianping. They propose mission descriptions and monetary rewards for Sybil campaigns.
2. **Agents (Organizers):** Responsible for accepting tasks from overhyped stores and managing the upper levels of the Sybil organization.
3. **Leaders:** Recruit Sybil workers and manage the creation of reviews. They distribute tasks and handle payments.
4. **Elite Sybil Workers:** Internet users recruited by leaders to post fake reviews for profit.

In this architecture, leaders play a crucial role in task distribution and quality control. They control a certain number of Sybil accounts, outsource tasks to highly-ranked users, and actively participate in generating high-quality reviews.

### Typical Workflow

Each Sybil campaign involves a collection of tasks, such as crafting positive fake reviews for a restaurant to boost ratings. The overhyped store sets the objectives, and the task is distributed from agents to Sybils. Sybils complete tasks by posting fake reviews and providing screenshots as evidence. If the work meets the customer's satisfaction, the Sybil worker is paid. Not all tasks are completed due to low-quality submissions.

### ELSIEDET: Design and Implementation

ELSIEDET is a three-tier Sybil detection system designed to detect Sybil communities, determine campaign time windows, and identify elite Sybil users.

**System Overview:**

1. **Phase I: Community Clustering and Classification**
   - Cluster communities based on collusion networks.
   - Perform binary classification to distinguish between Sybil and benign communities.

2. **Phase II: Extracting Time Windows**
   - Extract time windows of Sybil campaigns from labeled Sybil communities.
   - Identify users posting reviews during the active time period of campaigns.

3. **Phase III: Detecting Elite Sybil Users**
   - Use participation rates and a novel metric to determine elite Sybil users.
   - Elite Sybil users are motivated to participate in multiple campaigns due to high economic rewards.

### Sybil Community Detection

The first step in detecting Sybil communities is constructing Sybil social links for the Sybil users. This involves clustering and classifying communities to identify those involved in Sybil activities.

By addressing these challenges and implementing the ELSIEDET framework, we aim to effectively detect and mitigate Sybil attacks in URSNs.
