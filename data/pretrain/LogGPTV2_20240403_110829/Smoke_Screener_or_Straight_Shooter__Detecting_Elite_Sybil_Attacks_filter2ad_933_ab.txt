challenge in the most-up-to-date URSNs: They provide fake
content among little pieces of their information, regardless of
their accuracy, which is highly popular and endorsed by many
high-level organizers, exerting great
impact against which
there are no effective countermeasures. In this paper, we
characterize and detect a new type of Sybil attacks in URSNs,
typically applying our methodology to Dianping as our case
study.
In this section, we ﬁrst
introduce some deﬁnitions. We
then deﬁne a novel type of Sybil attackers, coined as elite
Sybil users. We ﬁnally take an in-depth dive into the typical
hierarchical architecture and the key actors playing in a Sybil
organization.
A. Terminology
To formulate our problem precisely, we introduce the fol-
lowing deﬁnitions.
DEFINITION III.1. Store: A Store S has an ofﬁcial website
on Dianping that contains a large number of reviews of this
particular store.
DEFINITION III.2. Community: A Community C is a group of
users who post reviews in similar stores to rate and comment
such stores.
REMARK III.3. In our paper, we categorize all communities
into two types: benign communities and Sybil communities.
We deﬁne a benign community to be formulated by all benign
(real, normal) users and a Sybil community to be formulated
by all Sybil (malicious) users. A set of users is also partitioned
into two types: A benign user is a person who posts honest
reviews and a Sybil user is a person who posts fake reviews
to boost the prestige of stores. We will use the terms benign
users and real users interchangeably.
DEFINITION III.4. Campaign: A campaign—denoted as
(C, S, Ts, Te), where C, S, Ts, Te denote community ID, store
ID, starting time, and ending time of a campaign—is an
activity in which users of a Community C post reviews in
Store S from Ts to Te to boost the prestige of Store S.
REMARK III.5. For Sybil users in a given community, these
Sybil users serve for various stores. Each of these stores
has one particular campaign launched by this community.
However,
these stores can have other campaigns, but are
launched by other communities.
B. Elite Sybil Users
In a Sybil organization of Dianping, we ﬁnd a new type of
Sybil users, termed elite Sybil users. Different from regular
Sybil users studied before, elite Sybil users post reviews
not belonging to Sybil tasks, which can harm the accuracy
of existing detection systems to a large degree. Elite Sybil
accounts are mainly composed of two kinds of accounts:
either (i) Sybil accounts created reviews not belonging to
Sybil tasks (smoke-screening) in order to mimic genuine users
purely for the use of campaigns; or (ii) accounts owned by
benign users—usually with high-rating stars—that convert to
Sybil accounts when fulﬁlling a Sybil task within a campaign
in order to reap the rewards offered by Sybil organizations
(The Sybil
task is detailed in Section III-C2.). Although
elite Sybil accounts belong to multiple users/entities, they are
manipulated by a single entity (i.e., Sybil leader). This satisﬁes
the deﬁnition of Sybil attack that a malicious entity takes on
3
multiple identities. Therefore we consider the attack performed
by elite Sybil accounts as Sybil attack. By hiding behind
massive reasonable reviews posted however deliberately or
unwittingly, these reviews posted by elite Sybil users appear
realistic as those posted by benign users. Compared with
regular Sybil users, elite Sybil users are more active out of
the Sybil campaigns, which enables elite Sybil users to have
a much lower percentage of fake reviews in their posts and
higher user-level star-ratings (see Section VI).
Black market and economic factors. Here, we try to explore
the monetary reward for an elite Sybil user on Dianping.
Table I shows hierarchical rewards for a speciﬁc Sybil or-
ganization into which we inﬁltrated recently. We see that
the rewards depend on the ratings of Sybil accounts. Not
surprisingly, the monetary rewards earned by each submission
increase as the ratings of accounts increase. This is largely
because users with higher ratings have a larger inﬂuence,
their reviews are less likely to be deleted, and thus are more
attractive to Sybil organizers. Likewise, the reviews from the
highly-ranked users are more inﬂuential, and have a larger
chance of being presented in the front page of a store, which
can potentially attract more attention from customers.

C. Anatomy of Elite Sybil Attack Operations
Many review websites are suffering from review manipula-
tion, which can be seen as a variant of Sybil attacks in URSNs.
Similar to Yelp and TripAdvisor, Dianping is struggling with
review manipulation as well. To investigate these organizations
in depth, we impersonated Sybil users in order to investigate
how the tasks are distributed and executed by the Sybil
organizer. Note that, for the ethical considerations, we did
not perform any real tasks in reality. In most cases, Sybil
leaders regularly post contact information on social media
(e.g., Tencent QQ, WeChat, and Douban Group1) to attract
Sybil workers. Speciﬁcally, we acquired contact information
from Douban Group to reach out many Sybil organizations.
During our month-long investigation, we found that the Sybil
attacks on Dianping show a unique organization pattern.
1) A Hybrid Architecture: Sybil organizations usually show
either a centralized or distributed architecture on Facebook or
Twitter. The Sybil organization on Dianping, however, evolves
to a hybrid architecture, which involves four key actors, as
shown in Figure 1:
1Douban Group, being part of Douban, is composed of huge numbers of sub
forums for users to post messages under various topics. https://www.douban.

Fig. 1. The architecture of a Sybil organization
1) Customers (or Overhyped stores): Businesses that want
to boost their scores rapidly on Dianping. Overhyped
stores propose mission description and monetary re-
wards for a Sybil organization to launch Sybil cam-
paigns. They are beneﬁciaries from Sybil campaigns.
2) Agents: Organizers are agents who are responsible for
accepting the tasks from overhyped stores and upper
management of a Sybil organization. Organizers take
charge of launching the Sybil campaigns.
3) Leaders: Leaders take charge of recruiting Sybil workers
and make arrangements for crafting reviews. Leaders
distribute tasks to Sybil workers and payment.
4) Elite Sybil workers: Elite Sybil workers are Internet
users, recruited by leaders, who post fake reviews for
proﬁt. These elite Sybil accounts are then manipulated
by elite Sybil workers to post fake reviews. (Elite Sybil
accounts, users, and workers are interchangeable in this
paper.)
In this architecture, the leader plays a key role in task
distribution and quality control of review comments for the
following reasons: First, the leader himself/herself controls
a certain number of Sybil accounts, and these facilitate the
launch of a campaign. Second,
to increase the impact of
a campaign, the leader can also outsource a task to many
elite Sybil workers, especially highly-ranked Dianping users.
Finally, the leader actively participates in the review gen-
eration by directly generating the high-quality reviews by
himself/herself or by closely supervising the review generation
of workers. In summary, if elite Sybil workers are the puppets,
then Sybil leaders are the masters who locally dominate the
unique workﬂow of Sybil organizations on Dianping.
2) Typical Workﬂow: Each Sybil campaign is centered on
a collection of tasks. For example, a campaign launched by
an organization entails crafting positive fake reviews for a
restaurant to boost ratings on Dianping. In this case, the owner
of the overhyped store sets up the objects of a Sybil campaign,
and the task is further distributed from organizers to Sybils.
Each task would be “posting a single (fake) positive review
online.” Sybils who complete a task generate submissions
that include screenshots of the fake reviews to be posted
as evidence of his/her work (see Figure 2). The overhyped
stores/agents can then verify if the work has been done to
their satisfaction. It is important to notice that not all tasks
can be completed because of some low-quality submissions.
Customers(Overhyped Stores)AgentsLeaderLeaderLeaderWorkersRegular Sybil AccountElite Sybil Accountlargest C2C website in China, we ﬁnd that an overhyped store,
through several Sybil organizers, have collected approximately
100, 000 elite Sybil accounts. For the Sybil organization we
have inﬁltrated, we observed 30 tasks which were assigned
in three months. For a particular task, the store exploits some
of these elite Sybil accounts to generate 500 fake positive
reviews at the cost of around $3,000 in total. Moreover, the
Sybil organization we participated in also provides an after-
sales guarantee, meaning if fake reviews are deleted, it will
launch a second-round elite Sybil attack. In addition, we also
observe that rewards per submission on Dianping are many
more than those on other Chinese websites, such as ZBJ and
SDH [45]. The high monetary rewards incentivize the Sybil
agents or leaders to develop sophisticated pyramid schemes to
evade detection.
Based on the above discussion, it is clear that automatic
detection of elite Sybil users is important to prevent Sybil
attacks from URSNs. This motivated us to develop a novel
framework of Sybil detection.
IV. ELSIEDET: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
In this section, we will present
three components of
ELSIEDET (see Figure 4): detecting Sybil communities, de-
termining campaign time windows, and detecting elite Sybil
users.
A. System Overview
ELSIEDET is a three-tier Sybil detection system. In Phase I,
we cluster communities based on collusion networks and per-
form a binary classiﬁcation on detected-communities, echoing
that a large number of fake reviews are usually posted by
the Sybil community under the guidance of the Sybil leaders.
In this phase, regular Sybil users will be clustered in Sybil
communities, but most elite Sybil users are able to evade
community clustering by covering up their collusion.
In Phase II, we extract time windows of Sybil campaigns
from labeled Sybil communities. The rational behind the
design is that a Sybil campaign has an active time period.
A user posting a review towards the target store during the
active time period is considered as a campaign-involved user.
This user could be either a benign user who happens to visit
the store and posts her reviews at that time or a Sybil user
who posts fake reviews for the campaign beneﬁts. We observe
that a benign user posts reviews based on her real experience
while a Sybil user always posts reviews during the active time
period of the Sybil campaigns.
In Phase III, followed by the undetected users and corre-
sponding extracted Sybil campaign time windows, we ﬁrst
use the participation rate between users and communities
to characterize the extent to which a user is related to a
community; then we leverage a novel metric to determine
elite Sybil users. The rationale behind the elite Sybil detection
algorithm is that, through using elaborate reviews to obfuscate
their fake reviews,
the elite Sybil users are motivated to
participate in multiple Sybil campaigns due to a high economic
Fig. 2. An example of a fake review
The key feature of a Sybil organization on Dianping is that
the Sybil leader is actively involved in the Sybil tasks. In
particular, when receiving a task from the customer, a Sybil
leader distributes this task to multiple elite Sybil workers and
guides review generation, which is illustrated in step (1) in
Figure 3.
• Leader-supervised model: In this model, the reviews are
created by an elite Sybil worker (step 2.1) and the gen-
erated content and posting time must follow the leader’s
guidance and must be approved by the said leader (step
2.2).
• Leader hands-on model: In this model, it is the leader
or the customer that generates the review comments ﬁrst.
The generated reviews are normally high-quality com-
ments that include both favored comments and pictures
of food or the store (step 2).
Given a certain review, the worker posts fake reviews of the
speciﬁed stores (step 3). The leader will check if these crafted
fake reviews exist for a period of 3 to 7 days (step 4). Once
the existence of fake reviews is conﬁrmed, the leader will pay
the elite Sybil worker (step 5).
Fig. 3. The process to post fake reviews
Through our investigation, we ﬁnd that cultivating a 3-star
elite Sybil account endorsing a tutorial offered by a Sybil orga-
nizer is priced at $6 per account. The tutorial provides details
about the approach to boosting ratings of Sybil accounts and
mimicking benign accounts. In concrete, (i) once an account
is activated, its proﬁle information, such as gender, date of
birth, address, and proﬁle picture, needs editing to the require-
ments of the tutorial. (ii) Before participating in the Sybil
organization, a great number of reasonable reviews are also
required to cultivate an elite Sybil account. Specially, through
our sting operation in a Sybil organization on Taobao,2 the

2) The two reviews are created within a ﬁxed time slot ∆T :
3) Both two reviews are 1-star or both of them are 5-star:
|Tk − T (cid:48)
Lk = L(cid:48)
l| ≤ ∆T ;
l = 1-star or Lk = L(cid:48)
l = 5-star.
Otherwise, Pu(k) = 0.
Note that
in previous research [11], Cao et al. simply
deﬁned two collusive reviews if they pertain to the same
constraint object and their timestamps fall into the same ﬁxed
time slot, but these two collusive reviews deﬁned are not
mathematically equivalent.
Measuring similarity is key to grouping similar users.
Different from the previous research [11, 40] using Jaccard
similarity metric, we measure the similarity between pairwise
users u and v as follows:
m(cid:80)
m(cid:80)
n(cid:80)
n(cid:80)

rewarding. Therefore, the more campaigns a user participates
in, the more likely the user is an elite Sybil user.
B. Sybil Community Detection
In this section, we present the details of detecting the Sybil
community. The ﬁrst step of Sybil community detection is
constructing the Sybil social links for the Sybil users belonging
