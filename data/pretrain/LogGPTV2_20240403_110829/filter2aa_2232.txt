Why should you listen
Need a PoC quickly
- start with open source research
- integrate with commodity tools
- you can be up and running an hour from 
now
Fast
Build PoCs without major $$$ investment
- Start with RTLSDR-E4000 ~$50
- No need for other fancy LTE gear
Cheap
Enough about me, let’s track some phones

Radio Used To Be Hard
Now for $50...
Either RTLSDR will do, but the E4000 can hit 
one more LTE band than the newer R820T
RTLSDR - E4000
1 - Planes with ADS-B
Quick RTLSDR Demos
2 - Cars by their TPMS output

All this is great, but reading data != positional 
tracking.
I want a tool with a big green arrow
Data vs Positional
HF/DF
1 - Field testing during WW2
2 - Measure signal strength and time of arrival
3 - Sink u-boats
4 - Required massive infrastructure
HF/DF
“Time Difference of Arrival”
1. Measure time of arrival of a signal at two 
different points
2. Take the difference
3. Draw a bearing
TDOA DF
1. Requires extremely accurate clocking 
between radios
TDOA DF - Challenges
2. High frequency signals exceed sampling 
rate of RTL-SDR platform
TDOA DF - Challenges
Doppler DF requires a high speed moving 
antenna
50,000+ RPMs for GSM
Use hardware antenna switch to simulate 
doppler effect to determine bearing
Pseudo Doppler DF
Commercial PD DF System
1 - DF sync data when phones connect to 
towers
2 - Save it
3 - Plot it all with Kibana because that’s easy
Quick and Dirty LTE Tracker
3 - Tracking individuals by their LTE/GSM 
devices
