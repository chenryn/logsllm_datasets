User: I cannot open .py file through Google VM SSH Console. Kwrite and sudo apt-get install xvfb  are installed. 
My command:  
kwrite test.py 
I get the following error: 
kwrite: Cannot connect to X server. 
Do I need to change the command/install additional software?
Thanks
Assistant: X-Windows (X11 nowadays) is a client-server architecture. You can forward connections to your x server with a -X (uppercase) option to ssh (ie $ ssh -X username@server.com). This should work if everything is installed correctly on the server (apt-get usually does a good job of this, but I don't have a lot of experience with kwrite).
EDIT
from the ssh man page

X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the user's X authorization
               database) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring.
For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.  Please refer to the ssh -Y option and the
               ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for more information.

and the relevant -Y

-Y      Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.
