User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is Skype secure enough to transmit passwords? Is it considered "secure" to send a password in a skype message and delete the message after the recipient remembered the password?

Assistant: Questions I would ask myself before using skype for sending sensitive information:


Is the encryption truly end-user to end-user or is the data only encrypted between the user and Skype (thereby potentially giving Skype access)?
How are IM logs managed? Can you be sure that you have 'deleted' the password from the log?
Even if logs are not being stored to disk directly buy Skype, is the memory Skype uses for this non-pageable? i.e. could the password be placed into a page file without you being aware and hence become retrievable for local users?


Before satisfying these questions my own answer would have to be no.
