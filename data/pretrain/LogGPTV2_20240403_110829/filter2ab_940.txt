**Description:**
HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is a security measure designed to mitigate Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attacks. In such attacks, an adversary may use a mis-issued or fraudulent certificate to intercept and decrypt encrypted communications. HPKP enforces the use of specific, expected public keys, thereby ensuring that only trusted certificates are accepted. This helps prevent the use of unauthorized certificates and enhances the security of web communications.
