### ATT&CK ID: T1036.003
### ATT&CK Technique Name: Rename System Utilities

Adversaries may rename legitimate system utilities in an attempt to evade security controls and monitoring mechanisms that are designed to detect the misuse of these utilities. Security systems often have specific rules and controls in place to monitor and restrict the use of known system utilities that can be abused by attackers. By renaming a utility (e.g., changing `rundll32.exe` to a different name), adversaries can potentially bypass these security measures.

Another method involves copying or moving a legitimate utility to a non-standard directory and then renaming it. This technique can help adversaries avoid detection, as security systems may only monitor for the execution of system utilities from their standard locations. For example, if `rundll32.exe` is moved to a different directory and renamed, it may not trigger the same security alerts as when it is executed from its usual path.

By employing these tactics, adversaries can leverage the functionality of system utilities while reducing the likelihood of being detected by security controls.
