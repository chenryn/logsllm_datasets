When I tried to install Scrapy using the command `pip install scrapy` in the Command Prompt, it initially showed "Collecting scrapy." However, after a few seconds, I encountered the following error:

```
Command "c:\python35\python.exe -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='C:\\Users\\DELL\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pip-build-2nfj5t60\\Twisted\\setup.py';f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace('\r\n', '\n');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, 'exec'))" install --record C:\Users\DELL\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-0bjk1w93-record\install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile" failed with error code 1 in C:\Users\DELL\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-build-2nfj5t60\Twisted\
```

I am unable to understand the error. 

**Assistant's Response:**
It seems like you are using Python 3, so you should use `pip3` instead of `pip` to ensure that the package is installed for the correct version of Python. Try running the following command:

```sh
pip3 install scrapy
```

If you still encounter issues, please provide the full error message for further assistance.
