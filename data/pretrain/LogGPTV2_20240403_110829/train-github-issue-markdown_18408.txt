I've seen other similar posts, but I they seem not to apply to me. The role in
question worked fine in 2.2.

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
When trying to create a list of users, it throws the an error about an invalid
value error.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
I am running this task
This is the task I am trying to run.
    - name: create user 
      user:
        name: "{{ item.username }}"
        password: "{{ item.password|default(omit) }}"
        shell: /bin/bash
      become: true
      with_items: '{{ users }}'
      no_log: true
This is the `users` variable. I have truncated the vault values for brevity.
    users:
      - username: ptadmin
        password: !vault-encrypted |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          ...
        use_sudo: true
        use_ssh: false
      - username: ansibleremote
        password: "{{ petra_ansibleremote_password }}"
        use_sudo: true
        use_ssh: true
        public_key: !vault-encrypted |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          ...
      - username: semaphore
        password: "{{ petra_ansibleremote_password }}"
        use_sudo: true
        use_ssh: true
      - username: frosty
        password: !vault-encrypted |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          ...
        use_sudo: true
        use_ssh: true
        public_key: !vault-encrypted |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          ...
      - username: thebeardedone
        password: !vault-encrypted |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          ...
        use_sudo: true
        use_ssh: true
        public_key: !vault-encrypted |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          ...
      - username: senanufc
        password: !vault-encrypted |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          ...
        use_sudo: true
        use_ssh: true
        public_key: !vault-encrypted |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          ...
I tried a `debug` before it and the results are in this gist.
I also tried with below and the same thing happens
    - name: test loop
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item.username }}"
      with_items: "{{ users }}"
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Users created
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
    fatal: [petra-hq-dev-master]: FAILED! => {"failed": true, "msg": "the field 'args' has an invalid value, which appears to include a variable that is undefined. The error was: 'ansible.vars.unsafe_proxy.AnsibleUnsafeText object' has no attribute 'username'\n\nThe error appears to have been in '/etc/ansible/roles/thedumbtechguy.manage-users/tasks/create_users.yml': line 6, column 3, but may\nbe elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.\n\nThe offending line appears to be:\n\n\n- name: create user\n  ^ here\n"}
