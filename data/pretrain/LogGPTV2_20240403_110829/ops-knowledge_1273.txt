User: An application system needs to design and implement a reliable identity authentication and authorization mechanism. Please provide feasible solutions and technical selection suggestions.
Assistant: 1. Scheme design 1. Identity authentication (1) When the user registers based on the user name and password, record the user's user name and password. When a user logs in, verify that the user name and password entered by the user match those on record. For increased security, it is recommended to encrypt passwords using a hash function. (2) Based on the SSL/TLS certificate, users can apply for an SSL/TLS certificate from the certification authority for identity authentication. During the login process, the session key will be transmitted using an SSL/TLS certificate to ensure that the user's identity is authenticated. (3) Based on Single Sign-On (SSO), the user only needs to log in once to access multiple applications connected to the authentication service, and the user's identity can also be passed by the application. 2. Authorization mechanism (1) Role-based access control divides permissions according to different user roles, and only authorized roles can access specific resources. (2) Attribute-based access control uses user attributes as the basis of access control to determine whether users can access specific resources. (3) Policy-based access control defines a series of rules or policies, and determines whether users can access specific resources according to these rules or policies. 2. Suggestions for technology selection 1. Identity authentication (1) Based on the user name and password, it is developed in Java, and the password hash can use the Bcrypt algorithm. The Spring Security framework can provide security management and identity authentication functions. (2) Developed in Java based on SSL/TLS certificates, you can use the Spring Boot and Spring Security frameworks. (3) Based on single sign-on (Single Sign-On, SSO) using OAuth2.0 protocol, using Spring Security OAuth2 and Spring Boot technology. 2. Authorization mechanism (1) Shiro or Spring Security framework can be used for role-based access control. (2) Attribute-based access control Spring Security framework. Another suggestion might be Apache Shiro. (3) Policy-based access control Spring Security framework.
