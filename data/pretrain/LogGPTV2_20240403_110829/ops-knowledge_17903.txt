Server creating this folder automatically for every user which is logged in for the first time.

Thank you very much for help

Assistant: You can create a batch file to do this and use the same GPO to run the batch file after create the folder. 


Create a bat file and write:



  timeout 10

icacls "%userprofile%\Desktop\SupportTeam" /grant Everyone:M



Timeout 10 to wait until the folder is created. Everyone:M is to grand Everyone access to the folder.


Put the batch file on a shared folder on your network. Make sure to Everyone have access to this shared folder. 
Add the batch file to the GPO --> User Configuration --> Windows Settings --> Scripts--> Logon


Click on Add --> Browse for the batch file (where you save the bat file "The Shared folder on your network", you don't need to add any script parameters).


Logoff and back in. (permissions are applied when the user logs on to the computer).
