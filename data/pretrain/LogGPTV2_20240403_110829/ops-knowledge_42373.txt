User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why isn't autodiscover working after updating DNS I just migrated from Office365 to Amazon WorkMail. After updating DNS, I can log in to the WorkMail web application and send/receive emails. 

I have the following CNAME record added to DNS:

autodiscover    autodiscover.mail.us-east-1.awsapps.com


When I try to add the WorkMail account as an exchange account on IOS, I cannot do so without manually entering the server address. It attempts to redirect to login.microsoftonline.com.

Why is this happening?

Assistant: Try adding the autodiscover record as a SRV record, rather than a CNAME.
