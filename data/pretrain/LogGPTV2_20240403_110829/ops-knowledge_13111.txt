Question: "In a discussion about Android security testing, a colleague argues that using emulators is always preferable due to the convenience of snapshots and the ability to simulate various hardware configurations. How would you counter this argument?"
 "A": "Emulators cannot be rooted, making them less suitable for testing applications that require root access."
 "B": "Malware samples on emulators cannot be cleared by flashing a clean firmware, posing a persistent security risk."
 "C": "Emulators can offer convenience, but they are typically slow and may not represent realistic user environments, including root detection."
 "D": "Physical devices do not support API level changes, making them inflexible and unsuitable for comprehensive testing."
Answer: C
