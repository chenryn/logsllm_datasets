User: How to install Docker on an Ubuntu server and use Docker Compose to configure and manage containers?
Assistant: Install Docker on an Ubuntu server 1. Update the APT package manager: sudo apt-get update 2. Install Docker: sudo apt-get install docker.io 3. Start the Docker service: sudo systemctl start docker 4. Set Docker to automatically start on boot : sudo systemctl enable docker 5. Verify that the Docker installation is successful: sudo docker run hello-world Use Docker Compose to configure and manage containers 1. Install Docker Compose: sudo apt-get install docker-compose 2. Create a Docker Compose file: vi docker- compose.yml 3. Define the service in the Docker Compose file: for example, version: '3' services: web: build: . ports: - "5000:5000" volumes: - .:/code redis: image: "redis:alpine " 4. Start the Docker Compose service: docker-compose up -d 5. Stop the Docker Compose service: docker-compose down 6. Check the status of the Docker Compose service: docker-compose ps 7. Operate the Docker Compose service: docker-compose < command> For example, use the docker-compose ps command to check the service status. Use docker-compose stop to stop the service. Note: Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the deployment and management of Docker containers. Docker Compose uses a YAML format definition file to describe the dependencies between containers, container configuration and other information. It helps users build containerized applications quickly and easily without writing complex Docker commands.
