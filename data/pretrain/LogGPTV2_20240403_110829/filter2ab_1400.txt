### Title: Automation and Structured Knowledge in Tactical Threat Intelligence at Botconf 2018

In today's interconnected world, the risks are constantly evolving, and traditional cybersecurity solutions have been deemed inadequate by many. While these solutions still serve their intended purposes, the rise of targeted attacks and the sophistication of advanced cybercrime necessitate new approaches for defenders to combat these threats effectively.

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has emerged over the past decade, introducing new mindsets, tools, and methodologies to the broader Information Security (InfoSec) community. This presentation will first provide an overview of CTI and then focus specifically on Tactical Threat Intelligence.

We will examine how the analysis of adversaries' behavior has primarily been used to generate technical indicators and strategic feedback. We will review the current methods and tools employed for cyber threat profiling and discuss the limitations and challenges they present to intelligence tradecraft specialists.

Noting that todayâ€™s Tactical Threat Intelligence often fails to translate into actionable insights, we will explore new avenues that could make the discipline more operationally concrete. Additionally, we will address the difficulties faced by tactical analysts in automating tasks within a domain heavily influenced by psychological factors.
