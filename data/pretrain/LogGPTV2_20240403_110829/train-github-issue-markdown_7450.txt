I assumed that failing file operations (`rm`, `'mkdir`, etc.) return a
`SystemError` when they fail. However, under certain circumstances they return
an undocumented `UVError`. This seems like an unintentional leak of an
implementation detail:
    julia> try rm("a") catch err info(typeof(err)) end
    INFO: Base.UVError
    julia> try chmod("a", 0) catch err info(typeof(err)) end
    INFO: Base.UVError
The printed error messages look fine, but e.g. the error codes have different
meanings (`SystemError` uses `errno`, `UVError` uses its own set of
constants). Having different exception types makes it difficult to handle
these errors programmatically.
