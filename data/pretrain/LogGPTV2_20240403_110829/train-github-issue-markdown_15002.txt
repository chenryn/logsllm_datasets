##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 3.4 (tried on opencv 3.4.3 and opencv 4.0.1)
  * Operating System / Platform => Linux 64 bit (debian based -- ubunut, kubuntu, xubuntu, also tried on arch linux)
  * Compiler => gcc-6 g++6
##### Detailed description
This seems to be a similar issue to #6742
If two CUDA streams in two different threads try to simultaneously use apply()
to a cv::cuda::Filter created via e.g. (for doing edge detection with gabor
filters):  
auto filtptr = cv::cuda::createLinearFilter( CV_32FC1, CV_32FC1,
cv::getGaborKernel(cv::Size(ksize_pix, ksize_pix), sig_pix, th, lm_pix, gamma,
psi) );
Then it results in corrupted output in one or both of the outputs.
##### Steps to reproduce
See example code in #6742, but this bug behaviour occurs if the filter is a
createLinearFilter as well.
