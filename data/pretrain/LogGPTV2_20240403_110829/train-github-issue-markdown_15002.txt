### System Information
- **OpenCV Version:** 3.4 (tested on 3.4.3 and 4.0.1)
- **Operating System/Platform:** Linux 64-bit (Debian-based: Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu; also tested on Arch Linux)
- **Compiler:** GCC 6, G++ 6

### Detailed Description
This issue appears to be similar to the one reported in #6742. When two CUDA streams, each running in a different thread, attempt to simultaneously use the `apply()` method on a `cv::cuda::Filter` created via, for example, the following code (for edge detection using Gabor filters):

```cpp
auto filtptr = cv::cuda::createLinearFilter(
    CV_32FC1, CV_32FC1,
    cv::getGaborKernel(cv::Size(ksize_pix, ksize_pix), sig_pix, th, lm_pix, gamma, psi)
);
```

The result is corrupted output in one or both of the threads.

### Steps to Reproduce
Refer to the example code provided in issue #6742. The same bug behavior occurs when the filter is created using `createLinearFilter`.
