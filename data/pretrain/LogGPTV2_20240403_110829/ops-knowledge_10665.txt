User: ndb: (from google.appengine.ext import ndb)
datastore: (from gcloud import datastore)
What's the difference? I've seen both of them used, and hints they both save data to google datastore. Why are there two different implementations?
Assistant: The reason for the two implementations is that originally, the Datastore (called App Engine Datastore) was only available from inside App Engine (through a private RPC API). On Python, the only way to access this API was through an ORM-like library (NDB). As you can see on the import, it is part of the App Engine API.
Now Google has made the Datastore available outside of App Engine through a restful API called Cloud Datastore API. gcloud library is a client library that allows access to different rest APIs from Google Cloud, including the Cloud Datastore API.
