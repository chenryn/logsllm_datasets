User: How can I find what version of dwag I have installed in python?  Usually packagename.version does the trick, but dawg seems to lack the relevant methods.
Assistant: Since dawg was installed with pip, the best way to learn what version I have is with pip list installed.  (Credit to larsks' comment.)
