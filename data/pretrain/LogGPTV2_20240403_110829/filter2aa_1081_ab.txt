### The Impact of New Storage Technology on Forensic Practices

The advent of solid-state drives (SSDs) raises critical questions for forensic investigators. For instance, does creating a disk image of an SSD irrevocably destroy crucial evidence? Can deleted files be recovered using the same techniques employed on traditional hard drives? These are just a few of the many questions that need to be addressed.

Forensic investigators often rely on trace amounts of evidence to build or break a case. A single mistake during data acquisition or recovery can mean the difference between a successful conviction and a failed investigation. Therefore, investigative procedures should never be developed ad hoc, as this increases the risk of tampering with or destroying evidence. When working with new storage technologies, it is essential to understand the characteristics of the underlying physical storage and how data is managed and deleted by the drive or device (King, S112). By studying SSD forensics now, professionals will be better prepared to handle these drives in the future.

### Purpose

This project aims to comprehensively study the impact of SSDs on the forensic data acquisition and investigation process. Specifically, the research will focus on the impact of these drives on current forensic practices involving deleted file recovery. The ultimate goal is to determine how SSDs compare to traditional hard drives and whether traditional forensic approaches are sufficient for recovering deleted files from an SSD or if they must be modified. This research seeks to contribute to the forensic community by providing a more coherent understanding of the implications of working with SSDs, which can be referenced when collecting and investigating evidence stored on these devices.

### Literature Review

#### Minimal Research on SSDs in Forensics

Minimal research has been conducted on the impact of SSDs on existing forensic procedures, but this area is of keen interest within the digital forensics community. Preliminary work has shown that SSDs behave significantly differently from magnetic storage technologies and present unique challenges regarding data retention and forensic investigation (Bell, 11). This literature review will focus on general understandings and concepts related to flash memory forensics, including previous research in this area. It will also provide a basis for understanding the physical properties of flash media and highlight current research and issues to guide the direction and focus of this research.

#### Flash Memory Characteristics

The key component of an SSD is its flash memory, which exhibits different properties compared to traditional magnetic storage mediums. To understand SSDs, one must first understand the underlying flash memory. The article "Characterizing Flash Memory: Anomalies, Observations, and Applications" by researchers at the Center for Magnetic Recording Research at the University of California detailed these parameters (Grupp, et al.). The article provided information about the physical structure of flash memory and how data is stored on the medium. One interesting aspect was the analysis of flash memory life. Flash memory cells have a finite lifespan, and after extended periods of use, individual cells wear out and fail. When failures occur, the entire affected block of storage is taken out of service, potentially leaving residual data within the SSD. The study indicated that certain types of use patterns are more likely to cause errors in flash memory devices, and these errors increase dramatically as the manufacturer-specified lifecycle is approached (33).

#### Current State of the SSD Industry

To explore the current condition of the SSD industry and its applications in enterprise environments, Leventhal's work is relevant. As the cost per gigabyte of flash storage has declined exponentially over the past several years, the popularity of SSDs has increased substantially (Leventhal, 225). Benefits of SSDs include significantly reduced latencies, lower power consumption, and less heat dissipation compared to even the fastest rotating magnetic disks (30). However, flash memory is still expensive in terms of cost per gigabyte, making it less competitive for bulk data storage. For caching and logging, however, flash-based storage offers many advantages due to its faster performance and lower read and write latencies (28). Additionally, flash memory devices typically contain a substantial amount of "unadvertised" storage capacity held in reserve, which is invisible to the operating system (27). This can provide a source of residual data on the drive, which might be useful in a forensic investigation.

#### Technical Limitations of SSDs

To gain a further understanding of the technical limitations of SSDs, an article by Mark Moshayedi and Patrick Wilkison was referenced. This piece discussed some of the advantages and limitations of current SSD technology. One surprising restriction is that the cells in many types of flash memory must be erased before being written, and this erase process is very slow (Moshayedi, 36). Only an entire block can be erased at a time, meaning data is marked for deletion, but a block cannot be reclaimed until all the data on that block is either marked for deletion or moved to another block (36). This could leave residual data behind. SSDs also need to manage bad blocks that develop over time and replace them with good blocks (37-38). These operations require substantial background processing, which can become a bottleneck and potentially manipulate or delete potential evidence without receiving any commands from the operating system.

#### Wear-Leveling Algorithms

Several articles discussed the use of additional storage within an SSD for wear-leveling. The article "Design and Implementation of an Efficient Wear-Leveling Algorithm for Solid-State-Disk Microcontrollers" explored issues such as the management of block erasures and the movement of data from one area of the drive to another (Chang, 6:2-6:5). Because SSDs do not have the seek time associated with mechanical drives, there is minimal performance penalty for random versus sequential reads. This results in data being scattered widely across the drive, along with many blocks of data that may be marked "invalid" but still contain information needing or waiting to be erased (6:6, 6:8). Investigating the wear-leveling algorithms used in SSDs could provide an interesting pathway for forensic investigations.

#### Simulating SSD Behavior

To better understand how an SSD can be represented to the operating system, the article "Modeling and Simulating Flash-based Solid-State Disks for Operating Systems" was chosen. Currently, most research concerning SSDs is directly performed on the physical hardware itself, with little research into how these drives might be simulated. The majority of the logic performed within an SSD is done by the driveâ€™s controller, and the operating system is often unaware of the differences between a magnetic hard drive and an SSD (Maghraoui, 17). If an operating system were more disk-type aware, there could be many benefits, especially with respect to SSDs, their block management, and data security. However, this could have potentially disastrous impacts on the viability of current forensic recovery methods and investigation procedures. Being able to simulate the behavior of an SSD and tailor this ability to improve operating system management routines for these devices would be a major breakthrough.

#### Data Sanitization and Secure Deletion

One of the most commonly cited papers on data sanitization and computer forensics is "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory" by Peter Gutmann and Colin Plumb (1996). This paper described a secure-deletion algorithm utilizing a series of 35 patterns to overwrite data. Since patterns are targeted towards specific encoding techniques, only the patterns designed for a certain method are necessary if the specific encoding is known (Gutmann, np). The implementation of the ATA secure-erase command has reduced the need for the Gutmann method, especially when an entire drive is being sanitized. This paper is notable from a historical standpoint, as it is commonly referenced in forensic data recovery. However, the research is often misunderstood, leading Gutmann to add an appendix to address these misconceptions and emphasize that the erasure patterns described are not applicable to most modern storage technologies (np).

#### Empirical Analysis of SSD Data Retention

In 2010, a research report titled "Solid State Drives: The Beginning of the End for Current Practice in Digital Forensic Recovery?" detailed experiments comparing the forensic properties of a traditional magnetic hard drive to an SSD. The study demonstrated that an SSD is fundamentally different from a magnetic storage drive, and the drive controller can manipulate data on its own (Bell, 7-10). The presence of a write-blocker did not prevent irrecoverable data loss (10-11). This article is groundbreaking, as it calls into question traditional forensic practices and alerts investigators to take caution when working with these drives. However, the scope of the research and the sample size were minimal, and the study only focused on drives that had been quick-formatted, leaving many questions unanswered.

In 2011, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University performed an empirical analysis of SSD data retention. This study sought to determine the impact of various operating systems on the operation of garbage collection algorithms of different SSDs, with particular attention paid to the TRIM command. The TRIM command manages blocks of storage that contain data no longer used by the operating system (King, S112-S113). Since flash-based memory cells must be completely erased to be re-used, the cleanup of these cells can cause a major loss of forensically interesting data. The researchers concluded that there is significant variability concerning combinations of operating systems, format types, and SSD controllers (S116). In some cases, deleted data can be recovered or nearly completely recovered, while in others, especially those involving operating systems and drives supporting TRIM, data is completely sanitized within minutes of deletion (S116-S117). A fundamental fact remains: SSDs demand different approaches for forensic investigation, and the technology and challenges involved are not yet well understood.

#### Reliable Erasure of Data from SSDs

Wei, et al., presented an article on the reliable erasure of data from flash-based SSDs. This article explored the effectiveness of traditional hard-drive sanitization procedures, including the implementation of the ATA secure-erase command and the use of data-wiping applications. The study found that the entire SSD can generally be successfully sanitized using existing techniques (Wei, 12). However, single-file sanitization techniques were consistently ineffective at permanently removing data from the drive (7). The research also uncovered notable variability in the implementation of ATA commands for secure erase. In several cases, these commands were found to be completely ineffective at actually erasing the drive, while others worked just as effectively as those implemented on magnetic hard drive counterparts (4-5). The article also looked beyond the drive controller and examined the flash memory chips themselves. When bypassing the flash translation layer (FTL), it is possible to examine the contents of individual memory cells, where data may exist multiple times.
