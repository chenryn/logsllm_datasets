Abstract. The exponential growth of immigration crisis and the
recent terrorism cases revealed the increase of fraud occurrences,
cloning and identity theft with numerous social, economic
and political consequences. The trustworthiness of biometrics
during veriﬁcation processes has been compromised by spooﬁng
attackers sprang up to exploit the security gaps. Additionally,
the cryptography’s role in the area is highly important as
it may promote fair assessment procedures and foster public
trust by serving the demands for proportionality, reducing the
concerns about national surveillance. Literature eﬀorts are devoted
to studying model threats and problems raised by targeted
malicious actions for biometric techniques. However, attacks
against multimodal crypto-biometric systems have not received
much attention. This paper presents cryptosystems, intrusions and
countermeasures for single, multiple modalities and complicated
schemes. Finally, a novel bimodal privacy-friendly cryptosystem
is suggested, able to reject such kind of attacks, presenting an
anti-spooﬁng behavior under the cooperation between user and
the function. The aim of this multidisciplinary work is to organize
the current performances on how to develop security, contributing
to the research in privacy-by-design able to address real-world
use-cases and pinpoint the potentiality for improvements.

1 Introduction
Until relatively recently, biometric enabled systems have replaced the traditional
forms of individuals’ recognition of his/her presence, access to facilities or log
in to an account as their traits can be very discriminative yet less easily lost
or stolen. Automated identity management, using face, hand or ﬁngerprints,
has become an experience in everyday life, mainly due to their diﬀusion in
technologies, such as electronic passports or IDs. From border control, to log
on computers, mailing and eBanking services, biometrics constitute a unique
and integral part of the user, to whom are associated with, and this is a serious
tangible reason for being vulnerable to activities that threat to compromise not
only the reliability of the application, but also the security and privacy rights
of the person [191].
A closer look at the explanation for any extensive attack to ﬁelds related to
biometrics will lead to the nature of the data, the personal non-biometric
information that may be stored and correlated or other private facts, such as the
medical condition of the user that may be enclosed and revealed on occasions
where someone’s identity is not appropriately protected. In terms of spooﬁng, a
non-colluding honest entity tries to fake somebody else’s identity by presenting
samples of that person’s traits, or tries to gain beneﬁt from the “leakage” of
stored biometric information in a DB or an electronic chip. Considering the
special assumption when a biometric trait is compromised, then it cannot be
canceled and renewed, hence moreover, it seems critical that may be used to
create gelatin genetic clones of ﬁngerprints, contact lens with a copy of iris or
retinal scans, artiﬁcial replicas of faces, facial samples in the form of photographs,
a video or a 3D mask. Voice or even gait can be recorded, inducing a system to
falsely infer a presence under another’s identity. A behavioral biometric, such as
signature, handwriting are not stolen, under the classical term, but can be easily
mimicked and used to a certain degree for illegal means. These concerns have
given space to public debates on the pressing matter of conﬁdence in authorized,
biometry compulsive systems and therefore, societal, ethical themes.
As an address to the challenges of strengthened privacy for human characteristics,
a range of standards and security methodologies have been suggested. Standard
conventional cryptographic algorithms have been characterized, simply, as not
enough, as a result of not allowing and supporting comparison between template
and fresh sample caught on sensor, thus making the system possibly to be
cheated. In this philosophy, biometric template protection schemes have been
deployed. The paramount idea is the secured form of the stored template,
making it unusable without authorization, but still capable for recognition
its true energetic owner. The approaches try to follow the requirements of
accuracy, irreversibility, diversity, unlinkability, revocability. In the direction of

enhancing security, privacy information and overcome drawbacks in both areas,
the combinations of biometrics with cryptography techniques were born [109].
Crypto-biometric systems or biometric cryptosystems, as they are denoted in
this paper, respect the previously referred compulsions and additionally can
obtain cryptographic/crypto-bio keys strongly linked to the user’s identity.
Although crypto-biometrics propose alternative solutions, biometric recognition
systems are still suﬀering and sometimes defeated by intruders. Vulnerabilities
primarily include direct and indirect attacks performed at the sensor level,
or correspondingly, inside the parts of the system, such as communication
channels, storage domain, feature and matcher extractions. Direct operations
happen when an attacker tries to masquerade as a valid and authorized user
by changing his/her biometric characteristics, claiming a diﬀerent identity
posing himself/herself or presenting false traits. Surprisingly, multibiometric
systems, based on their sources, separated to multi- sensors, recorded samples,
algorithmics, units and modals, are constitute a more diﬃcult, but not impossible
target. Ideally, several mechanisms have been tried for the defense of security
for the involved items in a system, with controversial results. From a realistic
point of research, academic and industrial trials on detection, encryption and
anti-spooﬁng measures have been proposed to deal, in some extent, with these
threats.
In addition to these, admittedly, there has never been a proposed model on
how best biometrics applications can be secured, especially those ones that
are related to governmental and organizational purposes [191]. The proposals
for CBDBs including information for national ID cards or passports bring
about a feeling of discomfort, reinforcing the assertions wherein biometrics have
seen intrinsically as privacy’s foe. Conversely, keeping pace with technological
changes, biometric schemes as a modern and sometimes mandatory key to
validate transactions must also be given the capacity and the resources to deal
with millions of expected requests, always respecting their primary objectives
of data minimization, accuracy, transparency, conﬁdentiality etc. Template
protection models should prevent the re-generation of the original template
from the initial and the laws should strictly be followed to ensure their acceptance
from citizens.
This study is motivated by recent advances in the scientiﬁc ﬁeld of biometric
system security, and protected templates to ensure the secrecy of person’s
identity. Its target is to present and add new information to the studies against
fraud processes to biometric based veriﬁcation technologies, something that
since 2012 is indicated as well, from the increasing number of projects aim to
suggest ideas for preventing risks, directly applicable to special issues, such as
border control. Our essential objective here is to clarify the role of cryptology
in biometrics, and examine how honest is the statement for a safe and reliable

biometric application environment, when this is constantly exposed to human
mind’s contrivances. The remainder of the article is organized as follows: In the
next two sections, a thorough summarized review on research articles is analyzed,
particularly on the development of standard metrics, protocols and datasets
for the appraisal of the progress, introducing readers to enlightenment. The
fourth part is devoted to single and/or multibiometric cryptosystems, spooﬁng
attacks, and resistance processes. Fifth section aims to present the design of
an innovative multimodal model. It is a suggestion capable of being used in
electronic passport applications based on liveness detection and RFID access
control as combined mechanisms for reinforcement the cryptographic bearing
against spooﬁng. The privacy standards and principals are also discussed while
a standard evaluation methodology which is needed to assess the inﬂuence of
countermeasures on biometric system performance is indicated. As a conclusion,
comprehensive remarks together with some directions for future approaches are
listed, providing food for thought.
2 Preliminaries on Cryptography for Biometrics
2.1 Biometric Cryptosystems and Protocols
Approaches towards security of biometric technologies are brieﬂy presented in
this section. The variety of the concepts are divided to schemes that aspire to
transform the aforementioned data, reducing the possibilities for generation
of the initial trait used during the enrollment phase, and to cryptosystems
that combine known cryptographic functions to derive cryptographic keys from
biometric data. A uniform classiﬁcation of the various techniques according to
their functionality is described diagrammatically in Figure 1. In the ﬁrst division,
encryption, hashing, transformation and other cryptographic techniques produce
one-bit veriﬁcation for biometric systems. Next in order, data are used to obtain
keys that further will be used as an extra secured method. Ordinary biometric
systems requires prior a DB which contains stored biometric or non-biometric
references to the data for further comparison causes. The lack of revocability for
each of these pieces and the very existence of a place from where information
could be leaked, leading to numerous concerns.
For this reason and following the lines of the diagram, classical encryption of
biometric data, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) technique,
the trait collaborates with one, or more secrets, similar to passwords that
can be stored also in a token or smart card, preserving diversity. Cancelable
biometrics category has been studied extensively and inspired various designs for
other proposed methodologies. The fundamental ideology can be found in the

one-way function re/irreversible feature transformations, where there is luxury
for multiple transformed templates and their uses across applications, under the
same identity. At the second cryptosystems’ family, the creation and re-issuance
of keys from biometric data constitute a remarkable and template-free concept.
There is a cryptographic framework that is used to securely store just a key
born after enrollment and released only over successful veriﬁcation. This key
can be irrelevant or stable bit-string directly extracted from biometrics and in
binding approaches can be regenerated, as it is combined with the biometric
data using cryptography and it is possible to be later retrieved [23].
Protocols for re-generation crypto-biometrics in systems are come to address
the speciﬁc ways on how to share the keys between the untrusted parties of an
authorized user/client and an intended server’s principle, and as a ﬁeld lacks
of research progress. Symmetric-key cryptography is fast but too risky, on the
grounds that several cryptanalytic attacks can occur in the event of using a
single key for a large-scale application. Public key suggestions are vulnerable
to other kinds of attacks and initially they do not include the veriﬁcation of
authenticity to each entity. To overcome the limitations, protocols designs help
to share the crypto-bio keys or create secure authenticated sessions based on
biometrics [109].
Taking the advantage of this collective knowledge on the core technologies of
both biometrics and cryptography, pseudo-identities (PIs) based mostly on
70 A BIMODAL VERIFICATION CRYPTOSYSTEM AS A FRAMEWORK AGAINST SPOOFING ATTACKS
ﬁngerprint characteristics have been carefully chosen during the initial design
phase to accomplish a workable trustworthy and friendly scheme that serves
principals of user’s privacy [33]. The typical architecture of a related ecosystem
is based on the independent generation of references coming directly from live
biometric samples or already stored biometric templates which after their use
as parameters to the embed and non-invertible, one-way, yet unique, functions
are ﬁnally fully deleted/destroyed. The encoder veriﬁes the identity and builds
additional AD. These information may serve the purposes of interoperability.
The methodology is considered to be successful when the ﬁnal non-biometric
data can provide multiple renewable and protected templates, independent
PIs for the same individual within an application able to be used across other
systems to prevent DB cross matching and linking, preventing impersonation
and providing data separation for people with similar features and ability to
handle a duplicate enrollment check scenario.
Back to the process, at the second phase, some AD like knowledge-based
secrets to be entered by the enrollee, such as passwords, signature, secrets
are used as an input to the PI encoder and their string is not stored. During
veriﬁcation process, re-creation of a PI or directly veriﬁcation a previously stored
PI based on a provided recognition sample is performed. The transformation of
information and the provided data are also used and of course the same AD
from the user. The comparator compares both elements or identities to check
if originally coming from the ﬁrst subject. Validity checks and expiration can
be controlled especially for characteristics that can change with the passing
of the years. Revocation is also available, in case of deleting the PI from a
DB, and/or removing the authorization, then the re-enrollment may result in a
new protected template. Figure 2 presents the creation and veriﬁcation of the
PIs [33].
Figure 2: Protection mechanism of biometric pseudo-identities.
Indubitably, in every scenario, the veriﬁcation performance and the evaluation
of the overall function of the crypto-biometric systems largely depend and based

on the baseline of its system. The error correcting codes algorithms are used to
improve the degrades and analyze any perspectives able to change, in a better
level, each approach. The important factors are the adoption of multibiometrics
as an emerging development, understanding that obtaining high entropy keys
is still a challenging, but encouraging issue. The use of passwords, tokens,
electronic documents or smart cards can secure user’s privacy, the appropriate
secured sharing of the keys based on totally untrusted involved sides on a system
and the ability to combine basic elements from each category suﬃce to design
new complete hybrid systems.
2.2 Attack Points in Biometric Systems
The security breaches directly or indirectly, as described above, may aim towards
diﬀerent parts in system modules. Eights categories are used for notice the points
for possible threats, such as the generic scheme in Figure 3 portrays. The frame
symbolizes the inner aura and attacks that can take place in that are further
divided into three groups [174]. Threats at the communication channels between
diﬀerent parts of the system, attacks to the feature and matcher extractors,
those ones that could take place under the assumption of the DB of information
is compromised. The direct, also known as spooﬁng attacks are substantially
described at the next subsection and here indicated as the ﬁrst spot at the level
of sensor.
Figure 3: Areas of attacks on a typical biometric scheme.
An analytical outlook to indirect attacks involves a deviant and the
communication tunnel between user and the valid end system’s controller.
The attacker must mainly know speciﬁc information about the process of the
whole application, the template format, the scores, communications protocol,
the data transmission elements and can perform an access to all its stages. In
this way, the intruder can gain the extraction, changing, deleting, adding of
72 A BIMODAL VERIFICATION CRYPTOSYSTEM AS A FRAMEWORK AGAINST SPOOFING ATTACKS
important data on identities. Speciﬁcally, the communication channels across
consecutive parts of the system can be intercepted by an eavesdropper who
changes surreptitiously the messages in the link, manipulates the scores, decisions
and results or makes brute force attacks by exhaustively trying to ﬁnd the input
that can unlock the region of interest. During the pre-processing and feature
extraction progresses, insertion of impostor data and component replacement
can happen while the same could take place as well at the matcher level with the
hill-climbing algorithms, consisting on iteratively changing some synthetically
generated templates until the right one is found. Lastly, the DB’s region is
characterized as imperatively dangerous and involves malicious tampering at
the templates from reading to modiﬁcations of the links between biometric data,
increasing privacy concerns.
3 Comprehensive Literature Review
3.1 Spooﬁng Attacks
In the case of spooﬁng attacks that may take place directly towards the initial
level of sensor, a zero-eﬀort or active impostor tries to positively claim a diﬀerent
identity deceiving the acquisition system. The means of this kind attack are
highly depended on the type and quality of design and application. For the ﬁrst
mentioned, an unauthorized person uses his/her own trait that by mistake can
