Question: In a security testing scenario, a tester inadvertently uses an incorrect command to start the hostapd service, resulting in a failed attempt to establish a host access point. What are the potential consequences of this misconfiguration for the security testing process?
"A": "The mobile application may bypass the host access point, limiting the tester's ability to intercept and analyze traffic.",
"B": "The misconfiguration can enhance the encryption of data packets, making them harder to intercept.",
"C": "An incorrect command may start a different service that could interfere with the security testing environment.",
"D": "The mobile application's performance could be drastically improved, skewing testing results."
Answer: AC
