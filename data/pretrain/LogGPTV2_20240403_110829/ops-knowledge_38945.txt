User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Please analyze the following multiple lines of logs
 0 20:11:07 INFO Partition rdd_42_2 not found, computing it
 1 20:10:54 INFO Block broadcast_17 stored as values in memory (estimated size 10.1 KB, free 448.6 KB)
 2 20:11:07 INFO Partition rdd_42_9 not found, computing it

 4 20:11:08 INFO Partition rdd_42_34 not found, computing it
 5 20:11:08 INFO Partition rdd_42_11 not found, computing it

 7 20:10:53 INFO Block broadcast_15 stored as values in memory (estimated size 9.2 KB, free 416.6 KB)
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Partition rdd_<*> not found, computing it 和 Block <*> stored as values in memory (estimated size <*>, free <*>)
B: Changing modify acls to: <*> 和 SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi)
C: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi)
D: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 Slf4jLogger started
