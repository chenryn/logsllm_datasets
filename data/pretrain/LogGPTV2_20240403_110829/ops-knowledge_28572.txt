User: I want my GAE app to do some back-end processing and uploading/updating results to data-store after specific intervals of time (say every 6 hours). So whenever a user uses my app (and basically requests those values from the data-store) they would get the recent/updated values from the data-store.
How would this be implemented in google app engine? I'd really appreciate if someone could guide me in the right direction and/or provide me with information pertinent to doing something like this in python.
Assistant: Take a look at the Cron task or set a task queue with a specific ETA
