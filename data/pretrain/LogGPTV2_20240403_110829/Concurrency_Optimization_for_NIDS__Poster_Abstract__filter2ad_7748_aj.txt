Metabolic Reaction Network-based Recursive Metabolite Annotation for Untargeted Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Zheng-Jiang Zhu, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China
Large-scale metabolite annotation is a challenge in liquid chromatogram-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics Here, we develop 
a metabolic reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm (MetDNA) that substantially expands metabolite annotations without the need for a 
comprehensive standard spectral library Metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites tend to share similar MS2 spectra due to structural 
similarity Based on this rationale, MetDNA characterizes initial seed metabolites using a small tandem spectral library, and utilize their experimental MS2 
spectra as surrogate spectra to annotate their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites which are subsequently served as the basis for recursive analysis We 
further showcase the utility and versatility of MetDNA using different LC-MS instrumentations, data acquisition methods, and biological sample types, and 
demonstrate that about 2,000 metabolites can cumulatively be annotated from one experiment MetDNA largely expands the annotation of metabolites, 
thereby allowing quantitative assessment for not just metabolic pathways but also multi-omic studies, such as integrative analysis between metabolomics 
and transcriptomics

Sparse Multi-block PLS for Selection of Related Signals in Multi-platform Metabolomics Data
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Timothy Ebbels, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Kate Leary, Ibrahim Karaman, Goncalo Graca, David Herrington
Combining data from multiple assays is of great value when attempting to identify unknowns in metabolomics A key problem is how to associate 
signals from the same unknown in different assays Statistical correlation can be helpful in finding associated signals, but is susceptible to noise, outliers 
and artefacts Multivariate models are robust to these interferences and have proven their worth in many areas of metabolomic data modelling Here, 
we evaluate sparse Multiblock PLS (sMBPLS) regression as an approach to integrate multiplatform data, with the objective of linking signals from the 
same molecule, to aid the process of identifying unknowns We use real human serum NMR and LCMS data from a large cohort study with multiple 
epidemiological outcome variables To evaluate the approach, we electronically spike signals at realistic levels into the real data We find that signals from 
the same metabolite can be associated by this approach with a high degree of accuracy (AUROC=086 at 025 effect size, 10 spikes per block) We develop 
a novel visualisation tool allowing users to discover associated signals based on the sMBPLS model Application to real outcome data shows that the 
method is able to associate signals from the same metabolites across multiple assays, indicating that this is a promising approach to aid identification of 
unknowns and discovery of biomarkers in multiplatform metabolomic data

Understanding the metabolic perturbation in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Zeping Hu, Tsinghua University, China
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) caused by a recently identified bunyavirus, SFTSV, is an emerging infectious disease with extensive 
geographical distribution and high mortality Progressive viral replication and severe thrombocytopenia are key features of SFTSV infection and fatal 
outcome, whereas the underlying mechanisms are unknown We revealed arginine deficiency in SFTS cases by performing metabolomics analysis 
on two independent patient cohorts, suggesting that arginine metabolism by nitric oxide synthase and arginase is a key pathway in SFTSV infection 
and consequential death Arginine deficiency was associated with decreased intraplatelet nitric oxide (Plt-NO) concentration, platelet activation, and 
thrombocytopenia An expansion of arginase-expressing granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells was observed, which was related to T cell CD3-ζ 
chain down-regulation and virus clearance disturbance, implicating a role of arginase activity and arginine depletion in the impaired anti-SFTSV T cell 
function Moreover, a comprehensive measurement of arginine bioavailability, global arginine bioavailability ratio, was shown to be a good prognostic 
marker for fatal prediction in early infection A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that arginine administration was correlated with enhanced Plt-NO 
concentration, suppressed platelet activation, and elevated CD3-ζ chain expression and eventually associated with an accelerated virus clearance and 
thrombocytopenia recovery Together, our findings revealed the arginine catabolism pathway–associated regulation of platelet homeostasis and T cell 
dysregulation after SFTSV infection, which not only provided a functional mechanism underlying SFTS pathogenesis but also offered an alternative therapy 
choice for SFTS

Hijacking of host cellular function by opportunistic pathogens during intracellular infections
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Volker Behrends, University of Roehampton, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Natalia Bravo-Santano, James K Ellis, Luis M Mateos, Yolanda Calle, Hector C Keun, Michal Letek
Staphylococcus aureus is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections and a major human pathogen worldwide As a facultative intracellular 
pathogen, S aureus is able to invade both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant 
S aureus (MRSA) has made treating S aureus infections significantly more complicated Therefore, there is an urgent need to find novel therapies This 
study aims to identify and target host molecular pathways exploited by MRSA during intracellular infection with a view of identifying possible host-directed 
therapies We employed stable-isotope labelling coupled to GC/MS and NMR-based metabolic profiling to investigate the impact of bacterial infection on 
host carbon metabolism We found extensive metabolic re-routing (a block of mitochondrial uptake of pyruvate resulting in a decreased flux through the 
TCA cycle from glucose) and detected several distinct metabolic changes that suggested starvation-induced autophagy in infected cells These changes 
included increased uptake but lower intracellular levels of glucose, low abundance of several essential amino acids as well as markedly upregulated 
glutaminolysis We identified the molecular cascade activated in our infection model and showed that most of the autophagosomes detected in infected 
cells did not contain bacteria, suggesting that S aureus induces the autophagic flux during cell invasion for energy generation and nutrient scavenging 
Accordingly, drug-induced inhibition of AMPK, the responsible host kinase, hampered S aureus intracellular proliferation Our findings show that targeting 
host pathways essential for MRSA survival is a viable therapeutic strategy against this versatile pathogen

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an infection that affects immunocompromised hosts Due to the increasing occurrence and despite available antifungal 
therapy, IA is a leading cause of mortality in the ICU To asses this complex problem a multiplatform metabolomics approach was implemented Serum and 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from immunosuppressed patients, with and without IA, were profiled across three analytical platforms including LC/
MS, GC/MS, and CE/MS Due to the large intra-group variation caused by the variety of medical complications, apart from canonical chemometrics, a novel 
approach was applied Exploitation of the data was performed using the Top Inter-GEne Relation-(TIGER) machine learning classifier, which focuses on the 
relative order of features rather than their raw values The specialized evolutionary algorithm extends the concept of Relative Expression Analysis-(RXA) 
and enables the search for complex interactions and patterns in the metabolomics data In this way, we found several interesting metabolic classifiers As 
an example: if the concentration of glutamine is higher than the concentration of amino-caprylic, then with 80% probability such sample can be classified 
as a case Moreover, changes between native forms of metabolites and their epi-forms were evaluated, revealing for example significance of methylation 
processes over acetylation Extensive data analysis of two types of biological samples and multiplatform data integration allowed to determine metabolic 
differences between infected and uninfected patients This leads us to define the metabolic signature of the predisposition to the IA This metabolic 
signature was supported by clinical parameters to characterize the profile of such patients better

Alterations of systematic metabolism upon viral infection: from metabolite profiling to isotope tracing
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kristaps Klavins, CeMM - Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Alexander Lercher, Bettina Gürtl, Andreas Bergthaler
Viral infections cause severe perturbations of a host metabolome that goes along with inflammation, tissue damage, and metabolic reprogramming In this 
study, we investigated changes in systematic metabolism caused by chronic viral infection We infected mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus which 
is a well-established and pathophysiologically relevant model for chronic viral infection We performed targeted quantitative profiling of more than 180 
serum metabolites, including amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids from infected C57BL/6J wildtype (WT) 
mice, by LC-MS/MS We observed wide-spread metabolic alterations and, most notably, metabolites of the urea cycle were significantly changed The urea 
cycle is a central metabolic pathway expressed in the liver To fully characterize infection-induced changes of this pathway, we established a LC-MS based 
method for quantification of all urea cycle metabolites and the closely connected tricarboxylic acid cycle This method allowed us to confirm previous 
results as well as provided evidence of infection-induced reprogramming of the urea cycle To validate these findings we performed an in vivo tracing 
experiment using 13C labeled metabolites For reliable isotopologue detection, we employed high-resolution mass spectrometry and identified significant 
changes in degradation and synthesis rates of metabolites Employing and integrating complementary metabolomics approaches led to the identification 
of virus-induced reprogramming of the urea cycle and altered systemic metabolite levels during chronic viral infection

Characterisation of the human milk lipidome using liquid chromatography-ion mobility spectroscopy-mass 
spectrometry reveals novel lipids
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alexandra George, The University of Western Australia, School of Molecular Sciences, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Melvin Gay, Donna Geddes, Kevin Murray, Robert Trengove
The human milk (HM) lipidome is complex, with inter- and intra-individual variation present during the day, throughout a feed, and throughout lactation 
These lipids provide over 50% of the daily infant energy requirements, and are known to contribute to immune cell metabolism and activation, and neural 
and retinal development Although years of HM research have investigated the total fatty acid composition, these fatty acids are predominantly packaged 
as triacylglycerides in fat globules The positioning of the fatty acids on the triacylglyceride is critical for infant absorption, therefore analysis of individual 
fatty acids does not accurately represent the HM lipidome and its physiological relevance to the infant Liquid chromatography–ion mobility spectroscopy–
mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS) methodology has demonstrated its ability to more comprehensively characterize triacylglycerides in bovine milk, but 
has not been applied to HM To characterise the HM lipid profile, untargeted LC-IMS-MS was carried out on HM samples from a longitudinal cohort Over 
200 triacylglycerides and their fatty acid arrangements were identified, many of which have not previously been identified in HM The abundance of each 
triacylglyceride, such as C61H106O6 (22:0/16:0/20:4), was lower in pre-feed samples and higher in post-feed samples, and typically increased throughout 
the day C61H106O6 has potent antimicrobial properties and was measured in significantly lower concentrations in the milk of mothers with infants who 
more frequently suffered infections The additional orthogonal separation offered by ion mobility can more accurately profile HM lipids and provides an 
opportunity to fully characterise the HM lipidome and its impact on infant outcomes

Metabolomics and toxicity studies of zebrafish embryos exposed to environmental contaminants
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Pim Leonards, Vrije Universiteit, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Jessica Legradi
Per- and polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) have been widely used as organic surfactants in industrial and consumer products While these 
applications made PFASs very appealing their properties make PFAS very persistent in the environment In this study we performed a chemical alternatives 
assessment using metabolomics between PFOA and PFOS and alternative chemicals to be able to select environmentally friendly compounds  Zebrafish 
embryos (Danio rerio) were chronically and acutely exposured (01 µM , 1 µM , 10 µM ) to PFOA and PFOs and its alternatives PFHxS, PFBS, siloxanes 
(D4, D5 and TMS), and GenX to study the mechanism of toxicity No significant effects on mortality, visual developmental abnormalities, and swimming 
activity were observed for all compounds Embryos were subjected to further investigation in an attempt to address potential genetic and metabolomic 
effectsTranscription of the DNA damage gene was significantly up-regulated by over 2-fold relative to the control vs PFOA, PFHxS, PFOS and Genx 
Interestingly, the lipid metabolism gene was up-regulated by over 2-fold in the embryos exposed to PFOS and GenX These observations corresponds well 
with the metabolomics data that showed the regulation of many lipids (PC, PE, TAG, SM) Based on the results of this study, alterations in lipid metabolism 
(glycerophospholipids) may be a metabolic pathway affected by both PFASs and their alternatives GENX, as alternative to PFOA, displayed a pattern of 
similar activity as the PFASs The alternatives D4, D5 and TMS appears to have a lower impact on metabolic pathways (eg lipids) than PFOA

According to WHO (2016), 91% of people living in cities are exposed to air pollution in levels above the recommended limits for air quality Ambient air 
pollution has been associated with a number of acute and chronic conditions, including obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, and lung 
cancer Therefore, there is a pressing interest in understanding the underlying metabolic mechanisms by which atmospheric air pollution affects human 
health An untargeted metabolomics approach was envisioned here to evaluate the effects of pre- and post-natal exposure to air pollution A cohort of 24 
pregnant mice was exposed during pregnancy to either filtered air or PM25 enriched polluted air Offspring were further exposed: filtered air (n=35), and 
polluted air (n=39) Urine samples were collected and analyzed by HILIC-MS (zwitterionic-sulfobetaine column) Raw data were preprocessed (XCMS) and 
statistically evaluated using uni- and multi-variate approaches (SIMCA-P) Group classification clearly indicated the occurrence of metabolic alterations in 
mice as a result of both maternal and offspring exposure For the mothers, 108 metabolites were putatively identified out of 137 discriminant metabolites 
and many chemical classes were impacted such as peptides, fatty acids, amines, and ketones For the offspring, several group comparisons were possible, 
resulting in alterations of metabolic pathways associated to histamine and tryptophan biochemistry A deeper evaluation of the metabolic pathways 
revealed by this work can greatly contribute to understand the link between air pollution and disease development, and perhaps, lead to the setting of new 
regulations and public health initiatives

Association between coffee consumption, plasma metabolites and hypertension risk
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Wei Jie Seow, National University of Singapore, Singapore
CO-AUTHORS: Wei Jie Seow, Wenchi Pan, Deron R. Herr, Federico Torta, Chin Meng Khoo, Markus R Wenk, Tai E Shyong, Rob M. van Dam
Background: Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world It is known that coffee drinking is associated with short-term spikes in blood 
pressure However, the associations between coffee consumption, blood metabolites and hypertension risk in Asian populations are still largely 
unknown Objectives: To assess the associations between dietary coffee consumption and hypertension risk, with potential mediation via blood 
metabolites Methods: We used data from 3,020 participants of the population-based Singapore Prospective Study Programme (SP2) cohort Amino acids, 
acylcarnitines and lipids in pre-diagnostic blood were measured using mass spectrometry Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between coffee, metabolites and hypertension risk, adjusting for potential confounders 
Mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportion of mediated effect via the metabolites on the association between coffee consumption and 
hypertension risk False discovery rate (FDR) was evaluated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method Results: Coffee consumption was associated 
with a 13% higher risk of incident hypertension for each cup of coffee consumed per day (OR=113,95%CI=102-126,P-value=0024) Coffee was also 
associated with significant changes in the levels of 59 metabolites (FDR<10%), including sphingolipids and acylcarnitines Levels of three metabolites 
(Cer d18:1/22:0,SM d16:1/24:0,HexCer d16:1/22:0) were directly associated with hypertension risk Part of the putative effect of coffee intake on increasing 
hypertension risk was estimated to be mediated via these metabolites Conclusions: Higher coffee consumption was found to be associated with higher 
hypertension risk, with possible partial mediation through blood ceramides and sphingomyelin concentration

Small molecules and lipids preserved over thousands of years in mummified humans
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kevin Quinn, University of Colorado Anschutz, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Charmion Cruickshank-Quinn, Spencer Mahaffey, Roger Powell, Richard Reisdorph, Nichole Reisdorph
Background: The mummified remains of ancient persons can provide clues about their environment, health, and death While previous studies have 
focused on genetic and proteomic analyses, few studies have utilized untargeted metabolomics for either exploratory purposes or to gain insight into the 
mummification process The goal was to determine differences associated with age and mummification process Methods: The tissues from four, naturally 
preserved mummies were examined: Oetzi the Iceman (5,300 years old), Scythian Warrior (2,400 years old), Scythian Princess (2,400 years old), and a 
mummy found in an apartment in Vienna, Austria (4 years old) Samples were prepared using solid phase extraction to obtain the following four fractions: 
aqueous small molecules, fatty acids, neutral lipids, and phospholipids Fractions were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) 
in positive and negative ionization mode with electrospray time-of-flight MS Results: There were between 2,400 and 3,070 compounds detected in the 
mummified tissue samples These compounds included oxidative stress-related compounds and bacterial/microbiome-associated metabolites The lipid 
peroxidation product, 4-oxo-nonenal was detected in all the mummified samples, while urobilin (a degradation product of heme), and the antioxidant 
uric acid were only detected in the apartment mummy The lipid PI(40:3) showed a pronounced decrease with time based on the age of the mummy that 
became undetectable at 5,300 years The top enriched pathways (FDR < 00001) were sphingolipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism 
Conclusion: Results suggest that certain small molecules and lipids can survive for millennia following the mummification process and that oxidation could 
indicate length of mummification

Food preservative zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) induces neurobehavioral deficits in mice with altered  
gut microbiome and dysregulated serum and hippocampus metabolome
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Chang Chen, Chongqing Medical University, China
CO-AUTHORS: Xuejun Jiang, Xia Qin, Shanshan Zhang, Yujia Zhang, Lulu Bai, Tianxiong Wang, Zhen Zou, Chengzhi Chen
Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) is widely used as food preservative, but its impact on health has not been fully elucidated We studied the effect of 
orally administrated ZnONPs on the neurobehavior of mice, as well as the possible mechanism from the perspective of gut microbiome and serum and 
hippocampus metabolome Results show that mice administrated with ZnONPs (n = 8) at equivalent dose to human food exhibited lower numbers of cross 
platform, longer escape latency in Morris water maze, and shorter total distance in open field test than their counterparts (n = 8) Eight bacterial clades 
were downregulated, while seven upregulated in the gut of mice in ZnONPs group Twenty-six differential metabolites were found from serum and four 
from hippocampus Correlation analysis found that the differential bacterial clades had a close relationship with the differential metabolites We conclude 
that oral administration of ZnONPs may cause neurobehavioral deficits in mice, which is associated with a crosstalk between altered gut microbiome and 
serum/hippocampus metabolome

Integration of MS imaging and LC-MS techniques – discovering tissue heterogeneity with the accuracy  
and depth of traditional profiling tools
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Matthew Lewis, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
LC-MS, GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy are generally considered to be the core analytical approaches for metabolic profiling, however they are far from 
optimally applied in a number of cases including the analysis of biological tissues and high throughput analysis At Imperial College London, capitalizing 
on the depth of experience within our National Phenome Centre and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) facilities, we are advancing the integration of 
metabolic profiling approaches in an effort to realise the broader potential of technology-driven translational medicine Although metabolic imaging by 
mass spectrometry is a sensible approach for the analysis of highly heterogeneous tissues, the approach suffers from poor sensitivity and the lack of ion 
structure information such as MS/MS or collisional cross section Combining MSI with LC-MS can potentially solve these problems and also serve as a core 
for the integration of clinical chemistry and histopathology Our approach utilizes serial sections, where one section is subjected to metabolic imaging by 
desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) The MSI data is analysed by supervised multivariate methods to identify histologically homogeneous segments 
and then the tumour part is segmented further using an unsupervised approach The positions of discrete sub-histological phenotypic segments are 
registered on the following sections and dissected using laser capture microdissection The resulting samples are extracted and subjected to LC-MS-
based metabolic profiling This approach allows us to perform traditional metabolite identification, spatially resolved quantification and detection of low-
abundance species in tissues Furthermore, the approach also allows the broader integration of other systems biology tools (genomics, transcriptomics, 
proteomics) with histology
