**ATT&CK ID:** S0497  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Dacls

The Dacls Mach-O binary has been camouflaged as a `.nib` file.[10]

In this revised version, I have:
1. Added clear labels for the ATT&CK ID and Technique Name.
2. Replaced "disguised" with "camouflaged" to provide a more precise and technical description.
3. Ensured the text is concise and professional.
