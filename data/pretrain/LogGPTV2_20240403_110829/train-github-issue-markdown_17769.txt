Possibly this issue is not an issue of Windows Terminal but of WSL or of one
specific distribution within WSL.
# Environment
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.356]
    Windows Terminal (Preview) [Version 0.4.2382.0]
    WSL 1 with Ubuntu 18.04 (not sure how to find out the build number)
# Steps to reproduce
  * start Windows Terminal
  * open a tab with WSL Ubuntu 18.04 (maybe also with other distributions)
  * choose a light theme (like One Half Light) in the `profiles.json` file
  * view a man page (e.g. `man grep`)
  * play with values for `brightWhite` in the choosen color schema
# Expected behavior
General text should be colored in generic colors such as `foreground` or
explicit colors like `brightWhite` should change their color.
# Actual behavior
The WSL man page seems to use `brightWhite` for highlighted text in man pages.
`brightWhite` remains white in the light themes. The remaining text has the
color `foreground`.
grep manpage with default color schema `One Half Light`:

grep manpage with modified color schema `One Half Light` (`brightWhite` set to
`#FFFFFF`):
