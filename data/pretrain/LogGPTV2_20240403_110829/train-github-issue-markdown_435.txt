I want to know how to handle cases where everything goes wrong, I am not too
much worry for the workers, queue or db. I already know how their up time or
how they handle crashes.
But, I am still not sure to understand how works airflow. I assume that you a
server or a process that know when to add stuff in the queue to respect the
dag. Am I right ? if yes, how can I handle a crashes ? (can I duplicate this
server/process on a other container ?).
