User: I'm working on Mac Os 10.7 (Lion) and I have some questions:

What is the pre-installed version of python on Lion?
I've been working on this computer for some time now, and i've installed lots of software in order to do college work many times I didn't know what I was really doing. The thing is: now I hava on the /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/ a folder called "7.0" I'm pretty sure there no python version 7. Is this folder native or a third-part program installation. Can I delete it? (it's using 1 Gb on disk).
Where is located the original python that comes with mac os?
I've choose Homebrew as my package manager, is there a easy way to manage python versions with it?
Assistant: Lion uses Python 2.7 by default; 2.5 and 2.6 are also available.
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework does not exist on a stock install of Lion. My guess is that you've ended up with this by installing some application.
The default Python install is primarily installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework, although some components are located elsewhere.
Yes - you can brew install python@2 to get a Python 2.7 separate from the system version, or brew install python to get Python 3.7. Both will install to /usr/local, like any other Homebrew recipe.
