I want to get file list from form by using:
`photos = request.files.getlist("photo") `  
However if i haven't select anything, the photos value is never be [] like
other fields.
So the way to check for empty field is failed:
    if not photos:
       pass
The result for empty form is:  
` []`
How do i get rid of it?
