User: I have a GCS bucket containing some files in the path
gs://main-bucket/sub-directory-bucket/object1.gz
I would like to programmatically check if the sub-directory bucket contains one specific file. I would like to do this using gsutil. 
How could this be done?
Assistant: If for whatever reason you want to do something depending on the result of that listing (if there are for example parquet files on a directory load a bq table):
gsutil  -q stat  gs://dir/*.parquet; if [ $? == 0 ]; then  bq load ... ; fi
