Abstract. Understanding how services operate as part of large scale
global networks, the related risks and gains of different network struc-
tures and their dynamics is becoming increasingly critical for society.
Our vision and research agenda focuses on the particularly challenging
taskofbuilding,analyzing,andreasoningaboutglobalservicenetworks.
This paper explains how Service Network Analysis (SNA) can be used
to study and optimize the provisioning of complex services modeled as
Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSN), a computer-understandable
digital structure which represents connected and dependent services.
1 Introduction
Servicesthatofferdifferentcapabilitiesarealsodistributedoverspaceandtime.
These services are related, dependent, connected, and form networks. They are
brought together as new services through composition or aggregation. In many
situations, the value of services and networks is influenced by existing suppliers,
competitors, value-adders and customers. It is important to be able to under-
stand and reason about these networks to assist, e.g., decision-making involving
strategicinvestmentsinserviceinnovation.However,thisishardbecauseoftheir
scale (number of services a network may have) and the complexity of technical
aspects such as the temporal and spatial distribution, and the business aspects
such as the diversity of marketing, operations, business models and financial
aspects.
WeresorttoServiceNetworkAnalysis(SNA)thatoffersasystematicandsci-
entific analysis of service networks to address the above challenges. SNA views
service systems and service relationships [4] in terms of network theory, con-
sisting of nodes (representing individual services within the network) and ties
(whichrepresentrelationshipsbetweenservicessuchasroles,levelofintegration,
involvement strength, and cause-effect [4] bindings).
The dynamic nature of service networks indicates that their topology might
be shaped according to some intrinsic property, e.g. service cost, availability,
or extrinsic property, e.g. perceived customer preference. This dynamic behav-
ior has been verified in many fields. For example, Web Science looks at World
WideWebmodelsasalargedirectedgraphwithanapparentrandomcharacter.
Nonetheless,thetopologyofthisgraphhasevolvedtoascale-freenetwork[20]by

the ’popularity’ of certain documents (of ’popular sites’) which overtime be-
come hubs. In the same vein, SNA targets to find explanations for the structure
and behavior of service networks. Finding the mechanisms, laws, and properties
of service networks can enable to better understand and explain the structure,
evolution, cost, reliability, and coverage of service networks.

two models is that their encoding is based on Linked Data principles to retain
simplicity for computation, reuse existing vocabularies to maximize compatibil-
ity, and provide a simple – yet effective – means for publishing and interlinking

damental aspects to support the creating of global service networks.
In this paper, we explore SNA as introduced above and offer some prelim-
inary concepts, models and insights. Section 2 introduces the main terms and
concepts that will be used throughout the paper. In Section 3 we provide a
motivating scenario, from the field of cloud computing, to highlight the impor-
tance of constructing complex services by aggregating simpler building blocks
into service networks. Section 4 explains how Open Semantic Service Networks
(OSSN)[7] can be constructed by accessing remote and distributed computer-
understandable service descriptions. In Section 5, we present the field of service
network analysis and exemplify the objective of this new field of research. Sec-
tion6presentstherelatedworkinthisarea.Section7offersourconclusiononthe

of global service networks and there analysis can bring.
2 Terms and Concepts
To address the growing importance of connecting service systems, we have in-
troducedtheconceptsthatconstituteanOSSN[7].Aservice network isdefined
as a graph structure composed of service systems which are nodes connected by
one or more specific types of service relationship, the edges. A service system
is a functional unit with a boundary through which interactions occur with the
environment, and, especially, with other service systems. Service networks are
similar to social networks in their structure but connect service systems. When
no ambiguity arises, we will simply use the term service to refer to a service
system.
OSSNs are global service networks which relate services with the assump-
tion that firms make the information of their service systems openly available
using suitable models. Therefore, service systems, relationships, and networks
are said to be open when their models are transparently available and acces-
sible by external entities and follow an open-world assumption. The objective
of open services is very similar to the one explored by the linked data initiative
(http://linkeddata.org):exposing,sharing,andconnectingpiecesofdataand
information on the Semantic Web using URIs and RDF. Networks are said to
be semantic since service and relationships can be represented by using shared
models,commonvocabularies,andsemanticWebtheoriesandtechnologies.Ser-
vice networks bring together several players (e.g. service creators, aggregators,
providers, marketplaces, and consumers) that work together to deliver value to
consumers.
The (re)construction of OSSNs is the result of a peer-to-peer social process.
Firms,groupsandindividuals(i.e.thecommunity)areequalparticipantswhich
freely cooperate to provide information on services and their relationships to
ultimately create a unique global, large-scale service network. The principles
of OSSN (re)construction were presented in our previous work [7] and call for
self-governance, openness, free-access, autonomy, distribution, and decoupling.
3 Motivation Scenario
Our scenario is from the field of cloud computing. As cloud applications spread,
suchasplatform-as-a-service(PaaS)andsoftware-as-a-service(SaaS),thedepen-
denciesbetweenapplicationsincreases.Forexample,Heroku,Instagram,Pinter-
est and Netflix all establish a relationships with Amazon EC2 since they depen-
dent on its services. This has many implications e.g., a change in Amazon EC2
characteristics (e.g. its cost, reliability, and performance) can influence all the
dependent services.

SNA can be used to, e.g., minimize the cost of providing the aggregated ser-
vice S1 . The study of the network can suggest the use of other data storage

with a slightly lower reliability. Minimizing the cost of a service network can
be mapped to an assignment problem which in turn is mapped to fundamental
combinatorial optimization problems. This branch of service network analysis
will be explored in section 5.1. The effect of having a higher number of comple-
mentors CP and a lower number of competitors CO can also be studied since

4 Constructing an OSSN
The service network from the previous section can be constructed and repre-
sented using OSSN by accessing, retrieving and combining information from
service and relationship models. OSSN are networks which relate services with
the assumption that firms make the information of their services openly avail-
able using suitable models. In other words, we make the assumption that the
description of services S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 , S5 , and S6 is openly and

remotely available.
4.1 Open Service Descriptions
InOSSN,servicesaremodeledusingthefamilyoflanguagesnamed*-USDL(the
Unified Service Description Language)[5,8] to provide computer-understandable
descriptions for services. USDL relies on a shared vocabulary for the creation of
service models and includes concepts such as pricing, service level, availability,
androles.Theselanguages11,12,13allowtoformalizebusinessservicesandservice
systems in such a way that they can be used effectively for dynamic service
outsourcing, efficient SaaS trading, and automatic service contract negotiation.
As an example of service description modeling, we illustrate how the service
SugarCRM S5 from Section 3 was modeled using Linked USDL. The infor-
Sug
mation used to model the service was retrieved from its web site. A service and
a vocabulary model were created. The vocabulary contained domain dependent

concepts from the field of CRM systems (e.g., taxonomies of common instal-
lation options). Since Linked USDL only provides a generic service description
language, domain specific knowledge needs to be added to further enrich the
description of services. The excerpt from Listing 1.1 illustrates the description
