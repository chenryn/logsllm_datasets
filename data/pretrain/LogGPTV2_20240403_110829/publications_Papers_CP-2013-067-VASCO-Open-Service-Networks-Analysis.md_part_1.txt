## Abstract
Understanding the operation of services within large-scale global networks, including the associated risks and benefits of different network structures and their dynamics, is increasingly critical for society. Our research agenda focuses on the challenging task of building, analyzing, and reasoning about global service networks. This paper explains how Service Network Analysis (SNA) can be used to study and optimize the provisioning of complex services modeled as Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSN), a computer-understandable digital structure that represents connected and dependent services.

## 1. Introduction
Services with diverse capabilities are distributed over space and time, forming interconnected and interdependent networks. These networks are created by composing or aggregating individual services. The value of these services and networks is influenced by various stakeholders, including suppliers, competitors, value-adders, and customers. Understanding and reasoning about these networks is essential for decision-making, especially in strategic investments in service innovation. However, this is challenging due to the scale and complexity of technical and business aspects, such as temporal and spatial distribution, marketing, operations, business models, and financial considerations.

Service Network Analysis (SNA) provides a systematic and scientific approach to address these challenges. SNA views service systems and relationships through the lens of network theory, where nodes represent individual services and ties represent relationships between services, such as roles, integration levels, involvement strength, and cause-effect bindings.

The dynamic nature of service networks suggests that their topology may be shaped by intrinsic properties (e.g., service cost, availability) or extrinsic properties (e.g., perceived customer preference). This dynamic behavior has been observed in various fields, such as Web Science, where the World Wide Web's topology has evolved into a scale-free network through preferential attachment. Similarly, SNA aims to find explanations for the structure and behavior of service networks, enabling a better understanding of their evolution, cost, reliability, and coverage.

This paper aggregates and presents four approaches from different fields that can be applied to analyze service networks:
1. Optimization
2. Evolutionary analysis
3. Cooperative analysis
4. Value analysis

These approaches, though developed independently and often applied to distinct fields (e.g., complex systems, logistics, economics, and markets), collectively offer solutions for SNA. Future work should focus on integrating these approaches to build a comprehensive body of scientific methods for service network analysis. Additionally, we describe how these service networks can be built from a technical perspective, using the Linked USDL language and the OSSR model to represent service relationships. These models are based on Linked Data principles, ensuring simplicity, reusability, and compatibility, and providing an effective means for publishing and interlinking distributed service descriptions for automated computer analysis.

In this paper, we explore SNA, introduce preliminary concepts and models, and provide insights. Section 2 introduces the main terms and concepts. Section 3 presents a motivating scenario from cloud computing. Section 4 explains the construction of Open Semantic Service Networks (OSSN). Section 5 discusses the field of service network analysis. Section 6 reviews related work. Section 7 concludes with the potential implications and improvements that the construction and analysis of global service networks can bring to society.

## 2. Terms and Concepts
To address the growing importance of connecting service systems, we introduce the concepts that constitute an OSSN. A service network is defined as a graph structure composed of service systems (nodes) connected by specific types of service relationships (edges). A service system is a functional unit with a boundary through which interactions occur with the environment and other service systems. Service networks are similar to social networks in structure but connect service systems. When no ambiguity arises, we will use the term "service" to refer to a service system.

OSSNs are global service networks that relate services with the assumption that firms make information about their service systems openly available using suitable models. Therefore, service systems, relationships, and networks are said to be open when their models are transparently available and accessible by external entities, following an open-world assumption. The objective of open services is similar to the linked data initiative, which aims to expose, share, and connect pieces of data and information on the Semantic Web using URIs and RDF. Networks are semantic because services and relationships can be represented using shared models, common vocabularies, and semantic web theories and technologies. Service networks bring together multiple players (e.g., service creators, aggregators, providers, marketplaces, and consumers) to deliver value to consumers.

The (re)construction of OSSNs is a peer-to-peer social process. Firms, groups, and individuals (i.e., the community) are equal participants who freely cooperate to provide information on services and their relationships, ultimately creating a unique, global, large-scale service network. The principles of OSSN (re)construction, presented in our previous work, call for self-governance, openness, free access, autonomy, distribution, and decoupling.

## 3. Motivation Scenario
Our scenario is from the field of cloud computing. As cloud applications like Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) spread, dependencies between applications increase. For example, Heroku, Instagram, Pinterest, and Netflix all depend on Amazon EC2, meaning changes in Amazon EC2's characteristics (e.g., cost, reliability, performance) can influence all dependent services.

Consider the service network in Figure 1. Two service aggregators (SA1 and SA2) of the ACME corporation decided to construct two new services: ACME Customer Relationship Management (S1) and ACME Business Intelligence (S2). These services were constructed by aggregating an existing cloud processing service provided by Heroku (S3) and a storage service provided by Amazon Elastic Block Store (S4). Additionally, S1 relied on the SugarCRM service (S5), an open-source, web-based CRM SaaS platform. On the other hand, S2 relied on the BIME service (S6), a SaaS solution for business analytics and data visualization. The relationships between services can be summarized as follows:

- S1 ← R1(S3, S4, S5)
- S2 ← R2(S3, S4, S6)

The two new services, S1 and S2, are commercialized by service providers SP5 and SP6. The atomic services S3, S4, S5, and S6 are provided by SP1, SP2, SP3, and SP4, respectively. Service consumers (C) can purchase and use any of the aggregated services. To operate, aggregated services must purchase computing/processing units from atomic services, indicating a dependency. Furthermore, S1 has a service complementor (osCommerce CP1) and S2 has a service competitor (SAS Visual Analytics CO1).

SNA can be used to minimize the cost of providing the aggregated service S1. The study of the network can suggest the use of other data storage and processing services that are less expensive, possibly with slightly lower reliability. Minimizing the cost of a service network can be mapped to an assignment problem, which is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem. This branch of SNA will be explored in Section 5.1. The effect of having more complementors and fewer competitors can also be studied, as it influences the perceived value of services. In this case, findings from social network analysis can be used to explore the influence of actors in the network.

## 4. Constructing an OSSN
The service network from the previous section can be constructed and represented using OSSN by accessing, retrieving, and combining information from service and relationship models. We assume that the descriptions of services S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 are openly and remotely available.

### 4.1. Open Service Descriptions
In OSSN, services are modeled using the *-USDL (Unified Service Description Language) family of languages to provide computer-understandable descriptions. USDL relies on a shared vocabulary for the creation of service models, including concepts such as pricing, service level, availability, and roles. These languages allow for the formalization of business services and service systems, enabling dynamic service outsourcing, efficient SaaS trading, and automatic service contract negotiation.

As an example, we illustrate how the SugarCRM service (S5) was modeled using Linked USDL. The information used to model the service was retrieved from its website. A service and vocabulary model were created, with the vocabulary containing domain-specific concepts from the field of CRM systems (e.g., taxonomies of common installation options). Since Linked USDL provides a generic service description language, domain-specific knowledge needs to be added to enrich the service description. The excerpt in Listing 1.1 illustrates the description of the SugarCRM service (written in Turtle language).

```turtle

:service_SugarCRM

        crm:On_premise_or_cloud_deployment,
        crm:Scheduled_data_backups,
        crm:Social_media_integration.
```

This structured and standardized approach ensures that service descriptions are easily interpretable and interoperable, facilitating the construction and analysis of global service networks.
