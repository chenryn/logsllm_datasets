I found this due to someone having a problem not being able to load large
integers with recfromcsv. After playing with it, I think it is simply ignoring
all the dtype information provided.
[https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/lib/npyio.py#L1859 Line 1859
in npyio.py, part of recfromcsv()] tries to either bring in the dtypes passed
or set None. However, it actually brings in a kwarg that I couldn't find
anywhere else called 'update' which looks suspiciously like a copied mistype
from earlier in the line.
If I change 'update' --> 'dtype', then the types get picked up as expected.
I found this in the github repo (although I may have been looking at the wrong
branch) as well as 1.6.2
