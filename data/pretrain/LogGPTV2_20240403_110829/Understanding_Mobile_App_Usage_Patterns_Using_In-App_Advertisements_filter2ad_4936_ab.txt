by the app using the process id (pid) of the app. Based on this thread information,
we can ﬁlter out the traﬃc that does not origin from the app. We extracted the
host names for the ad library by manually inspecting these traces and identifying
the host names that contain parts of the ad library name.
The main challenge in performing any meaningful analysis on real-world traces
is to identify the app from the ad ﬂow. As mentioned in Section 2.1, ad networks
identify the app using either app name or an identiﬁer that is unique to the app or
the developer. It is easy to identify an app from an ad ﬂow that uses app name to
identify the app. All we need to know is the key name used in the query. We can
do that by running a single app, that contains the given ad library, as explained
above, and obtain the key name that is used for the identiﬁer. For instance, for
Google Ads ﬂows, the app name is stored in the query parameter with the key
msid. So we can just look for msid= for any ﬂow to Google Ads and the value of the
parameter will give the app name such as net.zedge.android. Figure 6b shows
a Google Ads ﬂow. We can see that the ﬂow belongs to the app with the package
name com.portugalemgrande.LiveClock. For the ad networks that use unique
alphanumeric strings as identiﬁer, the identiﬁers may be present in the manifest
ﬁles. We can download all apps from any market, extract the manifest ﬁle, and gen-
erate a mapping of the identiﬁer for each app for each ad library. Figure 6(a) shows

Currently we are in the process of building a comprehensive mapping from iden-
tiﬁers to app names for the popular ad networks. However, due to the restrictions
imposed by Google on the number of apps that can be downloaded every day, the
mapping currently does not cover a large percentage of apps. Hence, we focus our
analysis on two popular ad networks (Google Ads and Smaato) that use app names
for identifying the apps in the ad ﬂows.
3.2 Dissecting Real World Traces
We analyzed the two days of data to see if the results presented by Xu et al [3]
hold in terms of temporal patterns of diﬀerent categories from an advertising
perspective. We broke up each day’s data into 1 hour buckets and analyzed the
traﬃc at three diﬀerent times of the day - (i) 6.00am-7.00am, (ii) 12pm-1pm,
and (iii) 6.00pm-7pm. Figure 8 shows the number of apps identiﬁed that belong
to Google Play Store and the ones from the unoﬃcial third-party markets. We
can see that out of the identiﬁed apps for Google Ads (Figure 7a), only 35-38%
belong to the oﬃcial Google Play Store. For Smaato, (Figure 7b), we have a much
smaller number of identiﬁed apps, but the percentage of those apps belonging to
Google Play Store is much higher (70-80%). What this seems to indicate is that
Google Ads is a popular choice for many of the app developers for the unoﬃcial
third-party app markets.
Xu et al [3] had observed some interesting diurnal patterns in diﬀerent app
categories. For example, they report that the weather and news apps are used
most frequently in the morning while sports apps peak in the early evening.
Similarly, an ad network provider, or a network operator, or a developer is likely
to ﬁnd the patterns of usage of apps containing ads very insightful. Figure 8a
shows the top 5 categories of apps present in the traﬃc at diﬀerent times for
Google Ads. We see that the app usage goes down at noon compared to early
morning and early in the evening. This is true for both weekday and weekend.
Another interesting observation is that the top 5 categories for apps using Google
Ads remains same irrespective of the time of the day or the day of the week.
What changes is the proportion of apps being used in one of these categories.
For instance, maximum number of Arcade apps are used on a weekend evening.
The top category diﬀers for Smaato (Arcade) from Google Ads (Brain) but
surprisingly it remains the same over time just as for Google Ads. Figure 8b
shows the usage patterns for the same categories over 12 hours on 21st June for
Google Ads. Again, we see the number of apps vary through the day but the
mix of categories remains more or less same.

4 Limitations and Future Work
Many of the free apps have corresponding paid apps that do not show any
ad. These paid apps can not be identiﬁed using our ad ﬂow based technique.
However, we observe that many ﬂows to third-party platforms like Facebook
and analytical services such as Google Analytics also contain identiﬁers that can
be used to identify the apps. We plan to extend our technique to include these
ﬂows in the future studies. However, we just like to point out that 73% of the
apps in Google Play are free [10].
A limitation of this technique is that some of the ad networks require developer
identiﬁers which can be shared by diﬀerent apps from the same developer. We
have observed that queries from many apps have certain unique patterns (such
as certain key-value parameters in the URL query) that can be used to identify
them [13]. In the future we plan to analyze patterns in the URL queries in ad
ﬂows to form ﬁngerprints that can be used to correctly attribute the ﬂow to the
originating app.
Grace et al [8] have observed that many of the ad libraries require user’s loca-
tion for targeted advertising. We conﬁrmed that many of the ad ﬂows contained
location information. In future, we plan to use this location information to iden-
tify spatial patterns in app usage. Moreover, if the traces contain information
about users, then we can build app usage proﬁles for each user which can be
used in applications such as targeted app recommendation.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a new direction for analyzing usage behavior of
mobile apps based on ad ﬂows. We described techniques for associating apps
with the ad ﬂows. We showed a ﬂavor of the kinds of analysis possible from app
markets and real world mobile network traﬃc from advertising perspective. We
believe that usage pattern analysis from advertising perspective is going to be
very important research area in the near future.
