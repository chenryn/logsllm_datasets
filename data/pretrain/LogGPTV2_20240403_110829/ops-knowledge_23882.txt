User: I'm deciding whether or not to include a "fetch 200/delete 200" routine of a pipeline inside a transaction.
If not included and the request/instance dies abruptly, the fetched entities would be lost.
Since with xg=True, the entity group limit is 5, the 200 entities need to have the same parent to be included in the transaction.
If delete_multi with 200 keys, count as 200 simultaneous updates to the entity group, the routine might fail, as the preferred limit to entity groups is 1/second.
When those 200 entities are deleted with ndb.delete_multi, does it count as 1 updates or 200 updates to the entity group?
Assistant: Inside the same transaction you can delete 200 entities/keys in one go.
The 1/second limit (more likely 5/second) should be read as: How often can I start (and commit) an independent transaction on an entity group or x-group. T.i. because each transaction needs a lock on the root element you're commiting.
