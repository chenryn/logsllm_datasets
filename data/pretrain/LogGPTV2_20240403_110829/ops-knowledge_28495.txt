User: Is it possible to run a script each time the dev server starts? Also at each deploy to google?
I want the application to fill the database based on what some methods returns.
Is there any way to do this?

Assistant: You can do this by writing a script in your favorite scripting language that performs the actions that you desire and then runs the dev server or runs appcfg.py update.
