# Evolution of IPv4 and IPv6 Topologies: AS Paths and Graphs

## 1. Introduction
This section analyzes the evolution of IPv4 and IPv6 topologies, focusing on the congruity of AS paths and the presence of dominant players in the IPv6 topology.

### 1.1 Fraction of Dual-Stacked Origin ASes with Identical AS-Level Paths
Figure 4 shows the fraction of dual-stacked origin ASes (those that advertise both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes) reachable over an identical AS-level path in both protocols. As of 2012, more than 40% of the AS-level paths used to reach an origin are the same in both IPv4 and IPv6.

### 1.2 Prominence of BGP Vantage Points
Figure 5 illustrates the fraction of origin ASes reached via a specific BGP vantage point in October 2011. Hurricane Electric (HE) is relatively more prominent in the IPv6 topology compared to Level3 in the IPv4 topology.

## 2. Analysis of IPv6 Deployment and Topology
The IPv6 graph has seen a significant increase in the number of STPs (Small Transit Providers) and CAHPs (Content and Hosting Providers) in the RIPE region since 2003, consistent with the stronger community pressure in Europe for IPv6 support, including European Commission funding.

## 3. Congruity of IPv4 and IPv6 AS Paths
We expect the best AS path between a given pair of ASes in IPv4 and IPv6 to converge. Improved congruity between IPv4 and IPv6 paths can improve IPv6 performance, promoting further IPv6 deployment.

### 3.1 Data Collection and Filtering
We measure the evolution of IPv6 from seven vantage points (four LTPs, two STPs, and one CAHP) that have provided BGP data to Routeviews and RIS since 2003. We use majority-filtered AS paths, remove prepending, and discard paths with AS sets or loops, which rejects 0.1% of AS paths.

### 3.2 Identical AS Paths in IPv4 and IPv6
Figure 4 plots the fraction of dual-stack paths that are identical in IPv4 and IPv6 from each vantage point over time. In January 2004, 10-20% of paths were the same; by 2012, 40-50% of paths are the same for six of the seven vantage points. The most significant trend is the rise in prominence of Hurricane Electric.

### 3.3 Differences in AS Paths
Since only 40-50% of the AS paths are the same, we analyze how the paths differ. Between 2011 and 2012, Hurricane Electric was added to 20-50% of IPv6 paths that were different from corresponding IPv4 paths, depending on the vantage point. No other AS is consistently missing from IPv4 paths.

### 3.4 Prominence of ASes in IPv4 and IPv6
In October 2011, Hurricane Electric appeared in the largest fraction of AS paths (20-95%) for all IPv6 vantage points, compared to fewer than 10% in the IPv4 topology. Level3 (AS3356), the largest player in the IPv4 space, appears in 5-80% of IPv4 AS paths, depending on the vantage point.

### 3.5 AS Path Lengths
The average AS path length in the IPv4 topology is almost constant at around 4 AS hops since January 1998. Figure 7 shows the average path length in the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies over time. The average AS path length for IPv6 shows a decreasing trend, especially since 2008. This result is counter-intuitive given the sparseness of the IPv6 topology.

#### 3.5.1 Detailed Path Length Analysis
Figure 6 shows the average AS path length from the perspective of Hurricane Electric and other vantage points. The average path lengths from vantage points other than HE are similar. The fraction of ASes directly connected to Hurricane in IPv6 increased from 10% in January 2007 to 40% in January 2010, possibly due to HE's open peering policy in IPv6.

## 4. Common ASes and AS Links in IPv4 and IPv6
We compare the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies over time, hypothesizing that as the IPv6 network matures, its topological structure should grow more congruent with IPv4.

### 4.1 Common ASes in IPv6 Topology
Figure 8 shows the fraction of ASes from the combined topology that are present in the IPv6 topology. Almost all LTPs are now seen in the IPv6 topology, while around 50% of STPs and CAHPs are also present. Fewer than 10% of ECs (Edge Customers) are seen in the IPv6 topology, confirming that IPv6 adoption is faster in the core of the network.

### 4.2 Geographic Distribution
The fraction of ASes from the combined topology that are present in IPv6 varies by geographic region. As of late 2011, the APNIC region (16%) is slightly ahead of RIPE (14%), which is well ahead of ARIN (9%). This ordering aligns with the projected depletion of IPv4 addresses in these regions.

## 5. Conclusion
The analysis reveals that the IPv6 topology is maturing, with increasing congruity in AS paths and the rising dominance of key players like Hurricane Electric. Further research is needed to understand the impact of these trends on overall network performance and stability.
