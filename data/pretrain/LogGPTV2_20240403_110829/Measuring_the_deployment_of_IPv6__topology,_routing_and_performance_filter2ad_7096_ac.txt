(PA) address space which is typically advertised in BGP by
a provider network. In the IPv6 graph the number of STPs
and CAHPs in the RIPE region has exceeded that of the
ARIN region since 2003 (the start of IPv6 data collection),
consistent with the stronger community pressure in Europe
for operators to support IPv6, including European Commis-
sion funding for IPv6 deployment from its early stages.
4. EVOLVING STRUCTURE OF IPV4 AND
IPV6 TOPOLOGIES: AS PATHS
Similar to our belief that the composition of a maturing
IPv6 topology should look more like the IPv4 topology, we
also expect a convergence to occur between the best AS
path between a given pair of ASes in IPv4 and IPv6. An-
other reason to compare IPv4 and IPv6 AS path congruity
is its correlation with performance.
In Section 7 we show
that IPv6 data plane performance is worse than IPv4 when
the AS paths diﬀer, but when the AS paths are the same,
IPv6 performance is comparable to that of IPv4. Improved
congruity between IPv4 and IPv6 paths seem to improve
IPv6 performance, which is likely to further promote IPv6
deployment. To explore trends in congruity between IPv4
and IPv6 paths, we ﬁrst calculate the fraction of AS paths
from a given vantage point (VP) toward dual-stacked origin
ASes (i.e., ASes that advertise both IPv4 and IPv6 preﬁxes)
that are identical in IPv4 and IPv6. If there are multiple
IPv4 or IPv6 AS paths available between a given VP and
an origin AS, we report it having an identical AS path if
any of the paths are the same. If they diﬀer, we dissect the
diﬀerences, in terms of which ASes are added and removed
from those paths. This analysis also reveals the presence of
dominant players in the IPv6 topology.
We ﬁrst measure the evolution of IPv6 from seven van-
tage points listed in Table 1 (four LTPs, two STPs, and
one CAHP) which have provided BGP data to Routeviews
and RIS since 2003. For each topology snapshot, we use the
set of majority-ﬁltered (as described in Section 2) AS paths
exported by these six monitors. We remove all prepending
from AS paths, and discard paths with AS sets or loops.
This ﬁltering process rejects 0.1% of AS paths due to AS
sets or loops.
Identical AS paths in IPv4 and IPv6
Figure 4 plots the fraction of dual-stack paths that are iden-
tical in IPv4 and IPv6 from each vantage point over time.
According to this metric, IPv6 paths are maturing slowly.
In January 2004, 10-20% of paths were the same for IPv4
and IPv6; eight years later, 40-50% of paths are the same for
six of the seven vantage points. The most signiﬁcant trend
in this data is the rise in prominence of Hurricane Electric.
In April 2007 only 5% of its dual-stacked paths were identi-
cal, but in 2012 just over 50% of dual-stacked paths are the
same from Hurricane’s perspective.
Diﬀerent ASes in IPv4 and IPv6 AS paths
Since only between 40% and 50% of the AS paths from diﬀer-
ent vantage points to dual-stacked origin ASes are the same,
the next question is: how do the paths diﬀer? We compute
the AS edits required to make the IPv4 paths identical to the

Figure 6: Average AS path lengths to dual-stacked origin networks over time from diﬀerent vantage points,
and the fraction of paths of length 2 (directly connected), length ≤ 3, and so on. In January 2011, HE was
directly connected to 40% of dual-stacked origin ASes in IPv6. Since 2003, other transit providers have
observed the fraction of directly connected dual-stack ASes decrease.
IPv6 paths – speciﬁcally, which ASes are most often added
and removed from AS paths that diﬀer. Between 2011 and
2012 Hurricane Electric was added to between 20% and 50%
of IPv6 paths that were diﬀerent to a corresponding IPv4
path, depending on the vantage point. There were no other
ASes added to IPv6 paths as frequently and consistently
across vantage points as Hurricane. No AS is consistently
missing from IPv4 paths.
ASes most frequently seen in AS paths
Next, we examine the AS paths from all BGP vantage points
(VPs) that provide a full table4 to Routeviews and RIPE
collectors in October 2011 to determine the relative promi-
nence of ASes in the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies. We deﬁne
the prominence of an AS X to a VP as the fraction of origin
ASes that are reached through it.5 While the AS that ap-
pears most often depends on the VP in question, we ﬁnd that
for all IPv6 VPs, Hurricane Electric appears in the largest
fraction of AS paths (between 20% and 95%, see Figure 5).
Contrast this with the importance of Hurricane Electric in
the IPv4 topology, where it appears in fewer than 10% of
AS paths from any given vantage point. Level3 (AS3356),
the largest player in the IPv4 space in terms of this metric,
appears in between 5% and 80% of IPv4 AS paths, depend-
ing on the vantage point. This data suggests that Hurricane
Electric is more prominent in the IPv6 graph than the most
prominent player in the IPv4 graph.
AS path lengths in IPv4 and IPv6
Even though the IPv4 AS graph continues to grow in the
number of ASes (linearly, after initial exponential growth
until 2002), the average AS path length as measured from
Routeviews/RIPE vantage points is almost constant around
4 AS hops since January 1998 [6]. We emphasize that this
result is based on ASes that provide data to Routeviews and
RIPE collectors, and does not necessarily reﬂect the aver-
age AS path length that an arbitrary AS sees. Figure 7
4We deﬁne a VP as having a full table if it has BGP paths
to at least 35,000 IPv4 ASes and 3,900 IPv6 ASes.
5This metric is related to betweenness centrality, but only
uses paths observed from a single VP.
shows the average path length (in AS hops after removing
AS prepending) in the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies over time,
as measured from all Routeviews and RIPE vantage points.
The average AS path length for IPv6 shows a decreasing
trend, and showed a sharp decrease since 2008. This re-
sult is counter-intuitive, given the relative sparseness of the
IPv6 topology as compared to the IPv4 topology. We dig
deeper into the possible reasons for the decreasing IPv6 AS
path length, by measuring the average AS path length from
diﬀerent IPv6 capable monitors over time.
Figure 6 shows the average AS path length seen from the
perspective of Hurricane Electric (6(a)), and from the other
vantage points (6(b)). The average path lengths from van-
tage points other than HE are similar, hence we group them
together. The plot also shows the number of AS paths of
length 2 (origin AS is directly connected to the VP), of
length ≤ 3, and so on. Our main observation is that the
average IPv6 AS path length seen by Hurricane Electric de-
creases, while for other transit providers it is almost con-
stant. The fraction of ASes directly connected to Hurricane
in IPv6 increased from 10% in Jan 2007 to 40% in Jan 2010,
perhaps as a result of Hurricane’s open peering policy in
IPv6 [21]. Other transit providers saw the fraction of dual-
stacked networks that are directly connected decline (indi-
cated by the curve labeled “==2” in Figure 6(b)), further
conﬁrming the rising dominance of HE in the IPv6 topol-
ogy. We conclude that the overall decreasing trend seen in
the average IPv6 AS path length is due to this increasing
dominance of HE in the IPv6 topology. We recommend cau-
tion in analyzing graph properties of the IPv6 AS topology;
due to its relatively small size, the presence of even a few
important ASes such as Hurricane Electric can signiﬁcantly
aﬀect overall graph properties.
5. EVOLVING STRUCTURE OF IPV4 AND
IPV6 TOPOLOGIES: AS GRAPHS
We next directly compare the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies
over time. Again we hypothesize that as the IPv6 network
matures, its topological structure should grow more congru-
ent with IPv4’s structure, i.e., an increasing fraction of ASes
and AS links will be common to both topologies, the most
542highly connected ASes should grow to be more similar in
both topologies, and upstream IPv4 and IPv6 providers for
the same edge AS should eventually converge.
5.1 Common ASes and AS links in the IPv4
and IPv6 graphs
For each topology snapshot, we ﬁnd the set of ASes that
are present in either the IPv4 or the IPv6 AS topology, which
we call the combined topology. In each snapshot, more than
99% of ASes and more than 96% of AS links in the combined
topology were present in the IPv4 topology, i.e., the number
of ASes that are unique to the IPv6 topology is negligibly
small. Consequently, we focus most of our analysis on the
set of ASes from the combined topology that were present
in the IPv6 topology.
Common ASes present in IPv6 topology
Figure 8 shows the fraction of ASes from the combined topol-
ogy that are present in the IPv6 topology. We measure these
fractions for all ASes, and further classify ASes according to
business type. We ﬁnd that the fraction of ASes from the
combined topology that are seen in the IPv6 topology varies
widely depending on business type. Almost all LTPs are
now seen in the IPv6 topology; The 3 exceptions are AS1
(owned by Level 3 Communications, but no longer the pri-
mary ASN), AS7132 (owned by AT&T. AS7018, also owned
by AT&T is in the IPv6 topology), and AS3786 (owned by
LG DACOM. AS9316 owned by the same organization is in
the IPv6 topology). Signiﬁcantly, around 50% of STPs and
CAHPs from the combined topology are also present in IPv6,
while fewer than 10% of ECs are seen in the IPv6 topology.
Since the combined AS topology is dominated by ECs, the
overall fraction of ASes seen in IPv6 is similarly low, which
further conﬁrms our earlier observation that IPv6 adoption
is faster in the core of the network while the edge (ECs) has
been slow to deploy IPv6.
We also measured the fraction of ASes from the combined
topology that are present in IPv6, separately for each geo-
graphic region (ﬁgure omitted due to space constraints). We
ﬁnd that this fraction is less than 20% for each geographic
region. As of late 2011, the APNIC region (for which 16%
of ASes from the combined topology are present in IPv6) is
slightly ahead of RIPE (14%), which is well ahead of ARIN
(9%). Interestingly, this ordering is the same order in which
the registries either ran out (APNIC in April 2011 [2]) or
are projected to run out of IPv4 addresses (RIPE in Au-
gust 2012, and ARIN in June 2013). As early as 2003, news
