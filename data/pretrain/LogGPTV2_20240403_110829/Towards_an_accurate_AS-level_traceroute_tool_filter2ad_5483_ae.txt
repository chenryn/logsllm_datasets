Figure 5: Mismatches caused by unannounced IP addresses
considered the traceroute and BGP AS hops a “match” if the BGP
AS hop was the same as either of the two siblings in the traceroute
AS path. After applying the new IP-to-AS mapping to all of the
traceroute paths, 85.9-87.0% of the traceroute AS paths matched
the corresponding BGP AS paths. This increase came from up to a
12% reduction in the mismatched paths and up to a 50% reduction
in the incomplete paths. As a result, the mismatched and incom-
plete paths became as low as 6.2% and 6.3% of the total number
of paths, respectively, as shown in the “Sibling ASes” columns of
Table 10.
5.4 Unannounced Infrastructure Addresses
An AS does not necessarily announce the addresses assigned to
its equipment via BGP. This can lead to “unmapped” addresses,
as discussed earlier in Section 3.3. However, sometimes these ad-
dresses fall into larger address blocks originated by the AS’s sibling
or provider. This can cause several patterns of mismatches between
the BGP and traceroute AS paths. In the example in Figure 5, AS C
connects to two upstream providers A and B. AS A has allocated
a subnet of its address space to AS C and originates the supernet
in BGP to the rest of the Internet. AS C uses its part of the address
block to number some of its equipment but C does not advertise
the subnet in BGP. As a result, some traceroute hops in AS C are
mistakenly mapped to AS A. Figure 5 shows four example paths:
Extra hop: Path 1 traverses some hops in AS C that (mistakenly)
map to A and others that (correctly) map to C, resulting in a tracer-
oute path of “A C” rather than “C”.
Missing hop: Path 2 traverses both A and C, resulting in a BGP
path of “A C.” However, the hops in C are (mistakenly) mapped
to A, resulting in a traceroute path of “A”.
Substitute hop: Path 3 traverses both B and C, resulting in a BGP
path of “B C.” However, the hops in C are (mistakenly) mapped
to A, resulting in a traceroute path of “B A.”
AS loop: Path 4 traverses ASes A and C, resulting in a BGP path of
“A C.” However, some of the hops in C are (mistakenly) mapped
to A, resulting in a traceroute path of “A C A.”
Focusing ﬁrst on AS loops, our algorithm looks for the loop pat-
terns in Figure 6(a). We count the number of times ASes G and
H appear together in this pattern, where the traceroute AS path
has a loop and the corresponding BGP path has a single hop for
each AS. In analyzing our data, we found that small number of
AS pairs appeared in many such paths, and these accounted for the
vast majority of the loops. Our algorithm applies a threshold of 50
occurrences before inferring that ASes G and H “share” address
space and changes the mapping of the second G hop to an H; that
is, once a traceroute AS path appears to “enter” an AS H, we as-
sume that the path continues in this AS. In effect, we assume that
H “owns” the addresses of these traceroute hops but did not adver-
tise them in BGP. However, we do not know the size of the address
block allocated to H. We inspect the IP addresses of the individ-
ual traceroute hops involved and add the corresponding /24 preﬁx
to our IP-to-AS mapping (with H as the associated AS). In apply-
ing this method, we found 20 unique AS pairs responsible for 830
unannounced /24 preﬁxes; many of these preﬁxes were adjacent,
suggesting that some larger subnets were involved. Furthermore,
the matched preﬁxes of the corresponding IP addresses tend to have
shorter length, indicating that there may be smaller subnets missing
in our preﬁx to AS mapping.
To check our results, we inspected the whois entries for these
ASes and conﬁrmed that in half of the 20 cases the two ASes
belonged to the same institution (i.e., the two ASes are siblings).
In two other cases, the AS pairs could be classiﬁed as siblings
based on their Web sites—AS 174 (PSINet) and AS 16631 (Co-
gent Communications), and AS 209 (Qwest) and AS 3908 (Super-
net). These two examples are cases where the whois data do not
capture acquisitions or mergers. Six more cases appeared to have a
provider-customer relationship, in that whois showed one AS (the
“customer”) responsible for a subnet of an address block assigned
to the other AS (the “provider”). In these cases, whois had address
assignment information that was not available from the BGP rout-
ing tables since the “customer” subnet was not visible in any of our
datasets. We were unable to verify the remaining two AS pairs.
For extra and substitute ASes, we follow a similar approach to
the algorithms for IXPs and siblings. Focusing on patterns like Fig-
ure 3 and Figure 6(c), we apply a threshold of fan-in and fan-out of
two to infer that an AS pair “shares” address space. Unlike the IXP
and sibling algorithms, we apply these checks at the preﬁx level, as-
suming that some /24 preﬁx that has not been announced. For the
“extra hop” case, we identiﬁed 308 such /24 preﬁxes; for the “sub-
stitute hop” case, we identiﬁed 25 preﬁxes. The case of a “missing
hop,” shown in Figure 6(b), is more complicated. By applying the
fan-in and fan-out thresholds, we identiﬁed 77 AS pairs that ap-
peared to “share” address space. However, we do not have a reli-
able way to determine which parts of the address block should be
associated with the “missing” AS. Therefore, we do not use these
results to modify our IP-to-AS mapping in any way. In ongoing
work we are exploring ways to handle “missing” hops.
After identifying the unannounced addresses and the owning AS,
we modify the IP-to-AS mapping to add a new entry for each /24
preﬁx. Applying the new IP-to-AS mapping across all of the tracer-

oute paths reduced the number of mismatched paths by as much as
a factor of two. In addition, the new mapping slightly reduced the
fraction of incomplete paths. Ultimately, after applying all three of
the techniques in this Section, the “match” rate exceeded 90% for
each data set and the ratio of matches to mismatches ranged from
25-35. Still, a small fraction (2.6–3.5%) of the traceroute AS paths
did not agree with the BGP AS paths; Section 6 explores possible
explanations for the remaining mismatches.
5.5 Diversity of Probing Locations
Our techniques rely on the topology diversity of the traceroute
measurements.
Increasing probing locations increases the likeli-
hood that a different AS-level path is used to traverse pairs of sib-
lings, Internet eXchange Pointis, and unannounced address spaces.
This, in turn, reduces the probability that they would be missed
in an AS-level traceroute tool based on our techniques. Both the
geographic location and the upstream connectivity have an impact

Table 12: Remaining mismatches with BGP AS path
on the diversity of AS-level paths. Previous work [26] studied the
marginal utility of discovering network topology using traceroute.
They concluded that increasing the number of sources in traceroute
experiments has low utility beyond the second source. Increasing
the number of sources is admittedly more important for our pur-
poses, though, since our heuristics rely on fan-in as well as fan-out
counts.
In our study, we try to cover all the destination preﬁxes in the
local BGP table. For each source, the set of destination probed is
roughly the same. We found that adding additional sources in our
study signiﬁcantly increases the fan-in and fan-out counts across
both sibling and IXP ASes. We compare the inference results based
on measurements from the ﬁrst three vantage points with all eight
locations. For example, the fan-in and fan-out count going through
PAIX, the Palo Alto Internet eXchange Point, increased from 5 and
14 to 9 and 50 respectively. Four known IXPs (Equinix San Jose,
London IXP, Mae-West San Jose, and Mae-East) were missed using
the ﬁrst three locations due to insufﬁcient fan-in and fan-out count,
but they are correctly inferred using all eight data sets. As several
newly added locations are in California, exchange points in San
Jose are therefore more likely to be inferred.
Table 11 compares the match between traceroute AS paths and
BGP AS paths using data from the ﬁrst three locations with the
complete data from all eight locations. The improvement is due to
newly discovered IXPs, siblings, and unannounced address blocks
as result of increased path diversity. The increase in matched
paths is only between 1.5 and 2.8%; however, the reduction in
mismatched paths ranges between 25–30%. This eliminates the
false positives for potential routing problems that network opera-
tors need to investigate further. The table also shows that the match
to mismatch ratio of comparing local BGP table AS paths with
traceroute AS paths increased by 35–50%. We believe that adding
vantage points in Europe and Asia would offer further advantages.
6. LEGITIMATE AS PATH MISMATCHES
In this section, we discuss four “legitimate” reasons why the
traceroute and BGP AS paths may disagree, and speculate on
whether the cases might explain some of the remaining “mis-
matches.” Where possible, we look for evidence of these cases
in our routing data and in the conﬁguration ﬁles for AS 7018. We
also propose additional measurement that would help classify these
mismatches more precisely.

6.1 Route Aggregation /Filtering
At each of our eight measurement locations, the local BGP table
does not have a complete view of the IP preﬁxes throughout the
Internet. To limit protocol and storage overhead, routers may be
conﬁgured to ﬁlter routes for certain subnets or combine multiple
subnets together into a single aggregated route [27]. For example,
Figure 7 shows an AS C that has the address block 8.0.0.0/8 and
