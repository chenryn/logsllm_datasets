 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
AFAIK, this is a bug.
**What is the current behavior?**
When setting `checked` on a checkbox, the checkbox indeed is checked, but the
attribute isn't actually in the DOM. This means that checkbox will be targeted
by `:checked`, but not `[checked]`. In my case, it is a blocker regarding
Selenium-powered tests as we use XPath to target elements and `[@checked]`
therefore doesn't work either.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem viahttps://jsfiddle.net or similar
(template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**
Check this out: https://jsfiddle.net/cw4hjLav/1/
Quick copypasta from my browser console (I ran those right after loading the
fiddle):
    document.querySelector('input[type=checkbox]')
    ​
    document.querySelector('input[type=checkbox]:checked')
    ​
    document.querySelector('input[type=checkbox][checked]')
    null
The behaviour is the same with `defaultChecked`.
**What is the expected behavior?**
The `checked` attribute actually is in the DOM whenever relevant.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
Tried this out with React 15 (the fiddle uses 15.0.1, my app uses 15.1.0),
with both Firefox 47.0 and Chromium 50 on Ubuntu 16.04.
I previously stumbled upon #3005 but didn't find the answer there, as my issue
doesn't seem to be `preventDefault()`-related. Thanks a lot!
