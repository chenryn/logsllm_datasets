### Introduction
On April 15, 2019, a vulnerability was discovered in Gitea. Intrigued by this, I began to investigate the issue. The vulnerability, described as follows, affects `models/repo_mirror.go` in Gitea versions prior to 1.7.6 and 1.8.x before 1.8-RC3. It involves mishandling of mirror repository URL settings, leading to potential remote code execution (RCE).

### Initial Investigation
I collaborated with my friend @hammer to study the vulnerability. We managed to control the contents of the git config file but faced challenges in progressing from the git config to RCE. After a few months, inspired by @lz1y and @x1nguang, I successfully reproduced the vulnerability.

### Patch Analysis
According to the CVE information, the vulnerability is fixed in Gitea versions 1.7.6 and 1.8.0-RC3. The relevant patch commits are #6593 and #6595. The key changes in the patch include modifying the URL option in the configuration file to use `NewCommand` instead of writing directly to the file. This suggests that the URL could be manipulated using `%0d%0a` to inject additional configuration changes.

### Controlling the Git Config
To exploit the vulnerability, we first need to create a new mirror repository. By capturing and modifying the `mirror_address` packet, we can inject additional configurations into the git config file. For example:

```
mirror_address=https%3A%2F%2Ftest%3A%40github.com%2FLoRexxar%2Ftest_for_gitea.git"""%0d%0a[core]%0d%0atest=/tmp%0d%0aa="""
```

This allows us to control the contents of the git config file. Updating the sync settings will also format the configuration on the server.

### Further Exploitation
The critical challenge is to achieve RCE from the controlled git config. Since the git server only retains the `.git` directory, it is difficult to introduce external files. One approach is to find a controllable file write or upload mechanism. Another method is to look for a configuration that can execute commands and trigger related configurations remotely.

### Exploiting Git Hooks
Git hooks are scripts executed during specific operations. In the web interface, only Gitea administrators can manage git hooks. However, by controlling the git config, we can modify the hooks directory. For example:

```
mirror_address=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FLoRexxar%2Ftest_for_gitea.git"""%0d%0a[core]%0d%0ahooksPath=/tmp%0d%0aa="""
```

This sets the `hooksPath` to `/tmp`, allowing us to write or create files in that directory and trigger the git hook to execute commands. In versions below 1.7.5, server files were saved in the Gitea running directory, such as `/data/tmp/local-repo/{repo_id}`.

### Implementing RCE via Git Config
With the help of @x1nGuang, I explored configurations like `gitProxy` and `sshCommand`.

#### `gitProxy`
`gitProxy` is a command executed when the git protocol requires fetch or other operations. Setting it to a malicious command, such as `calc.exe`, can lead to RCE. However, `gitProxy` does not accept parameters, limiting its exploitation. One workaround is to upload a binary file and then use `gitProxy` to execute it.

#### `sshCommand`
`sshCommand` allows custom SSH commands. For example:

```
mirror_address=https%3A%2F%2Ftest%3A%40github.com%2FLoRexxar%2Ftest_for_gitea.git"""%0d%0a[core]%0d%0asshCommand=calc.exe%0d%0aa="""
```

Unlike `gitProxy`, `sshCommand` can include parameters, making it more versatile for RCE.

### Conclusion
This vulnerability in Gitea highlights the complexities involved in exploiting git configurations. The entire exploit chain and git features have strong dependencies, making it an interesting and challenging experience. I hope to discover more vulnerabilities by examining the code of Gitea, Gogs, and GitLab.
