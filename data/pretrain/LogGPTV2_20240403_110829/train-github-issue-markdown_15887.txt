Just something I stumpled upon and I am not sure if this is a potential bug.
In the MatchQuery class in the blendTermQuery method there is
        if (fuzziness != null) {
            if (mapper != null) {
                Query query = mapper.fuzzyQuery(term.text(), fuzziness, fuzzyPrefixLength, maxExpansions, transpositions);
                if (query instanceof FuzzyQuery) {
                    QueryParsers.setRewriteMethod((FuzzyQuery) query, fuzzyRewriteMethod);
                }
            }
            int edits = fuzziness.asDistance(term.text());
            FuzzyQuery query = new FuzzyQuery(term, edits, fuzzyPrefixLength, maxExpansions, transpositions);
            QueryParsers.setRewriteMethod(query, rewriteMethod);
            return query;
        }
As far as I can see the if (mapper != null) branch doesn't really do anything.
Shouldn't that Query be returned?
