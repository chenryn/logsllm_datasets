### Title: Black Hat US-22: I Am Whoever I Say I Am: Infiltrating Identity Providers Using a 0-Click Exploit

**Abstract:**

Single Sign-On (SSO) has become the predominant authentication method for accessing multiple, yet independent, software systems. At the heart of SSO are identity providers (IdPs), which are responsible for verifying user credentials and issuing signed tokens that service providers (SPs) use for access control. Additionally, when an application requests resources on behalf of a user, an authorization request is made to an authorization server (AS). The AS exchanges a code for a token, which is then presented to a resource server (RS) to grant access to the requested resources.

While OAuth2 primarily handles authorization and SAML handles authentication, Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions have become essential in enterprise environments, managing both use cases. However, what if these IAM solutions are vulnerable to critical remote attacks? These solutions must be exposed to the internet, trusted to protect identities, and facilitate access for hundreds or even thousands of users and applications.

In this presentation, I will first cover the foundational use cases for IAM solutions and discuss some past real-world (ITW) attacks, along with their impact. I will then present the approach I took during the audit, including the challenges and pitfalls I encountered and how I overcame them. This will culminate in a demonstration of an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) as root, achieved by chaining multiple vulnerabilities in a widely used IAM solution employed by several Fortune 500 companies and government organizations.

The vulnerabilities will be discussed in detail, including innovative exploitation strategies for bypassing strict outbound network access controls. Finally, I will present a live demo and release functional exploit code, enabling penetration testers and network administrators to validate and remediate these critical findings.
