User: How to use Git for code management, and realize multi-person collaboration and version control?
Assistant: The main steps of using Git for code management and multi-person collaboration are as follows: 1. Create a Git warehouse: Use the command `git init` in the root directory of the code library folder to initialize the Git warehouse. 2. Add code: Use `git add` to add code and submit it to the Git repository. 3. Submit the code: Use `git commit` to submit the code to the local Git warehouse, and you can add comments. 4. Clone warehouse: Other members can use `git clone` to clone the code from the main warehouse to their own local warehouse. 5. Create a branch: Use `git branch` to create a branch to develop new features or fix problems. 6. Switch branch: Use `git checkout` to switch to an existing branch. 7. Merge branches: Use `git merge` to merge a branch into the current branch. 8. Pull and push: Use `git pull` to pull the changes on the main warehouse to the local warehouse, and use `git push` to push the changes from the local warehouse to the main warehouse. 9. Conflict resolution: Conflicts may be encountered when merging branches, which need to be resolved manually and submitted for modification. 10. View history: Use `git log` to view the commit history, and `git blame` to view the commit information of the last modification of each line of code. The above are the basic steps of Git for code management and multi-person collaboration, which need to be used in conjunction with specific project conditions. In order to ensure the code quality of multi-person collaboration, it is recommended to use standardized submission and naming rules, and use code review tools to ensure the quality of the code.
