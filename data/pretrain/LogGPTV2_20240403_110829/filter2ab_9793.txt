### Title: Botconf2022 - Private Clubs for Hackers: How Private Forums Shape the Malware Market

**Abstract:**

Discussion forums are asynchronous communication channels hosted on internet websites. A key feature of many such forums is a marketplace section, where both official and unofficial vendors can post about goods and services for sale, and customers can request specific products. This research aims to describe and understand the impact of the private nature of these forums on the activities of their participants.

Our primary hypothesis is that private discussion forums attract more sophisticated participants, who, in turn, offer and have access to more advanced tools. Specifically, this paper compares public and private discussion forums to analyze the following aspects:
- The types of malware (primary and secondary) advertised by participants.
- The infrastructure targeted by the malware.
- The freshness of the malware being advertised.
- The quality of the malware relative to its price.
- The level of trust in the sellers of malware.

Our findings suggest that while private discussion forums may not be the primary venue for the sale of unknown and highly sophisticated malware, they are likely the source of the most significant and organized threats.
