## Abstract
Decoy Routing, which uses routers as proxies instead of end hosts, is a new direction in anti-censorship research. Decoy Routers (DRs) are placed in Autonomous Systems (ASes) to proxy traffic from users, making it difficult for adversaries, such as censorious governments, to route around them. For example, containing China alone would require the cooperation of 850 ASes.

In this paper, we explore a different approach. We observe that DRs need not intercept all network paths from a country, but only those leading to Overt Destinations—unfiltered websites hosted outside the country. Our first question is: How many ASes are required to install DRs to intercept a large fraction of paths from, for example, China to the top-n websites (as per Alexa)? How does this number grow with n? Surprisingly, we find that the same few (≈ 30) ASes intercept over 90% of paths to the top-n sites worldwide, for n = 10, 20...200 and also to other destinations. This result aligns perfectly with the hierarchical model of the Internet, demonstrating that the number of ASes required for a worldwide DR framework is small (≈ 30). Additionally, attempts by censor nations to filter traffic along these 30 ASes will not only block their own citizens but also affect users in foreign ASes.

Our second contribution is to consider the detailed placement of DRs within each AS. Even with our small number of ASes, we still need approximately 11,700 DRs. We conclude that, although a DR system involves far fewer ASes than previously thought, it remains a significant undertaking. For example, the current cost of routers is over 10.3 billion USD, making such a project unfeasible for most actors, though not for major nation-states.

## 1. Introduction
Anti-censorship systems such as proxies or Tor suffer from a double bind. To be useful, the entry point to the service must be discoverable to the user, typically a citizen of a censorious country. However, once the entry point becomes common knowledge, it also comes to the attention of the censoring government, who shuts it down. Decoy Routing, a new anti-censorship paradigm, disrupts this dynamic by using special routers as proxies, rather than end hosts. A DR lies on the path of traffic between the user inside a censorious country and an apparent ("overt") destination; when it senses secret handshake data embedded in the user’s packets, it intercepts the packets and re-sends the message they carry to the real ("covert") destination. Unlike an end-host proxy, a DR cannot easily be blacklisted.

However, "easy" is a relative term. Schuchard et al. [11] propose that a sufficiently powerful adversary can simply route around ASes where DRs are positioned. Houmansadr et al. [1] argue that such a move is extremely expensive and suggest placing DRs in enough ASes to completely encircle a censorious country. They frame the problem of placing DRs versus bypassing them as an adversarial game. However, the best-known solutions still require the collaboration of several hundred ASes, leaving a single well-connected country with no choice but to route through one of them. Further, such solutions require separate sets of ASes for each adversary nation.

Our first contribution is a new approach to placing DRs. In Decoy Routing, the router intercepts messages from the user inside a censorious nation en route to an overt destination. Instead of trying to intercept all flows from a censorious country, we consider only the flows to overt destinations, which are likely well-known sites. We constructed a map of AS-level paths connecting all ASes of the Internet and found that the same set of 30 ASes intercept over 90% of paths to the top-10, 20...200 sites. This result is explained by the hierarchical structure of the Internet, where a few large multinational ASes provide access to most other ASes. We conclude that only 30 ASes, all in non-censorious countries, are sufficient for a DR infrastructure that intercepts more than 90% of paths to important websites. This method needs to be run only once, rather than separately for each censorious country.

Our second contribution is to study the detailed placement of DRs within each AS. We find that while the number of ASes required for a worldwide DR framework is very small (30), we need to replace on average 400 routers per AS with DRs. We conclude that a practical global DR system would still require placing over 11,700 DRs in about 13 different countries. The problem remains challenging even if we provide Decoy Routing to citizens of a single country. Unless we can deploy Decoy Routing on existing or augmented networking infrastructure, the cost alone would make such a project unfeasible for most actors, though not for major nation-states.

## 2. Background and Related Research
### 2.1 Network Anti-censorship and Decoy Routing
Our work focuses on the use of proxy servers to circumvent censorship. Popular anti-censorship solutions, such as Tor, are no longer effective against sophisticated nation-states. Decoy Routing uses special network routers called Decoy Routers (DRs) to perform proxying. The basic mechanism is as follows:

- The user, hosted within a censorious ISP network, wishes to communicate with censored destinations. They send packets addressed to an innocuous-looking website (the overt destination).
- These packets, allowed out of the censoring ISP, carry a steganographic message.
- If the packets pass through a DR, the steganographic message acts as a secret handshake. The DR decrypts the payload and establishes a new connection to the covert destination, sending the payload there.

Thus, a DR acts as a proxy, covertly communicating with a blocked site on behalf of the user. Implementations of Decoy Routing, such as Telex, Cirripede, TapDance, Rebound, and Slitheen, share this basic design. The challenge is to determine how hard it is for the censor to circumvent DRs and where the routers should be placed.

### 2.2 On the Placement of DRs
The question of where to place DRs was first raised by the Cirripede project, which claimed that placing DRs in just two tier-1 ASes is sufficient to serve all clients worldwide. Schuchard et al. [11] suggested that a powerful adversary, such as China, could redirect its traffic to avoid ASes with DRs. Mapping the Internet at the AS level, they showed that censor countries have enough alternative paths to route around a particular AS. Avoiding the top 100 ASes would disconnect China from only 2.3% of web destinations.

Houmansadr et al. [1] argued that, considering actual routing with directional business relationships between ASes, the RAD attack is too costly to be feasible. They proposed two ways to strategically place DRs:

1. **Sorted placement**: ASes that appear most frequently in the adversary’s routing tables.
2. **Strategic random**: ASes chosen randomly, but only among those with a large customer-cone.

While this approach is better than random, it still computes a separate, large set of ASes for every adversary (858 ASes for China, 835 for Venezuela, etc.). Kim et al. [9] suggested a graph-theoretic approach, but without considering inter-AS relationships.

Our first contribution is a new approach for placing DRs: we select the ASes that appear most frequently in paths from all ASes to popular websites (potential Overt Destinations). In our experiments, we consistently find that the same set of key ASes cover the vast majority (> 90%) of routes to the target. These "heavy-hitter" ASes are very likely the current "core" of the Internet, as first found by Rexford et al. [2], and are good candidates for placing DRs.
