ABSTRACT
Decoy Routing, the use of routers (rather than end hosts) as proxies,
is a new direction in anti-censorship research. Decoy Routers (DRs),
placed in Autonomous Systems, proxy traffic from users; so the
adversary, e.g. a censorious government, attempts to avoid them. It
is quite difficult to place DRs so the adversary cannot route around
them – for example, we need the cooperation of 850 ASes to contain
China alone [1].
In this paper, we consider a different approach. We begin by
noting that DRs need not intercept all the network paths from
a country, just those leading to Overt Destinations, i.e. unfiltered
websites hosted outside the country (usually popular ones, so that
client traffic to the OD does not make the censor suspicious). Our
first question is – How many ASes are required for installing DRs
to intercept a large fraction of paths from e.g. China to the top-
n websites (as per Alexa)? How does this number grow with n ?
To our surprise, the same few (≈ 30) ASes intercept over 90% of
paths to the top n sites worldwide, for n = 10, 20...200 and also to
other destinations. Investigating further, we find that this result fits
perfectly with the hierarchical model of the Internet [2]; our first
contribution is to demonstrate with real paths that the number of
ASes required for a world-wide DR framework is small (≈ 30). Further,
censor nations’ attempts to filter traffic along the paths transiting
these 30 ASes will not only block their own citizens, but others
residing in foreign ASes.
Our second contribution in this paper is to consider the details
of DR placement: not just in which ASes DRs should be placed to
intercept traffic, but exactly where in each AS. We find that even
with our small number of ASes, we still need a total of about 11, 700
DRs. We conclude that, even though a DR system involves far fewer
ASes than previously thought, it is still a major undertaking. For
example, the current routers cost over 10.3 billion USD, so if Decoy
Routing at line speed requires all-new hardware, the cost alone
would make such a project unfeasible for most actors (but not for
major nation states).

1 INTRODUCTION
Anti-censorship systems such as proxies or Tor [3] suffer from
a double bind. To be useful, the entry point to the service must
be discoverable to the user – typically, the citizen of a censorious
country. On the other hand, as soon as the entry point becomes
common knowledge, it also comes to the attention of the censoring
government, who shuts it down [4]. Decoy Routing, a new anti-
censorship paradigm[5–10], attempts to disrupt this dynamic by
using special routers as proxies, rather than end hosts. A DR lies on
the path of traffic between the user inside a censorious country and
an apparent (“overt”) destination; when it senses secret handshake
data embedded in the user’s packets, it intercepts the packets and
re-sends the message they carry to the real (“covert”) destination.
Note that the DR, being outside the censorious country, can freely
communicate with the covert destination – and unlike an end-host
proxy, cannot easily be blacklisted.
However, “easy” is a relative term. In their paper on “Routing
around Decoys” [11], Schuchard et al. propose that a sufficiently
powerful adversary can simply route around ASes in the Internet
where DRs are positioned. Houmansadr et al. [1] retort that such
a move is extremely expensive, and in any case one could leave
the adversary with no such option, e.g. by placing DRs in enough
ASes to completely encircle a censorious country. They then follow
up with a model [12], where they frame the problem of placing
DRs, versus the problem of bypassing them, as an adversarial game.
But the problem remains that the best known solutions still require
the collaboration of several hundred ASes, in order to leave a single
well-connected country1 with no choice but to route through one of
them. Further, such solutions require the computation of separate
sets of ASes for each adversary nation [1, 12].
Our first contribution in this paper is a new approach to the ques-
tion of placing DRs. In Decoy Routing, the router intercepts messages,
from the user inside a censorious nation, en route to an overt desti-
nation. What if, instead of trying to intercept all the flows from a
censorious country, we consider only the flows to the overt destina-
tions? The overt destination is most likely a well-known site, often
visited by citizens of the target country. [If not, it is very hard for
users to discover; and when it is found, the sudden surge of traffic
from users in China to some obscure website in e.g. Turkmenistan
will itself make the censor suspicious.]
As a first step, we started with the assumption that the overt
destinations are popular sites (such as the Alexa top-10). We con-
structed a map of AS-level paths, connecting all ASes of the Internet
1A “well-connected” country does not just refer to major powers like China; even e.g.
Venezuela is well-connected in this regard.
Interestingly, we found the same set of 30 ASes intercept over
90% of paths in all cases – whether we consider paths leading to
the top-10, 20 ... or 200. However, this result is easy to explain
in hindsight. The Internet consists of ASes linked by peer-peer
and provider-customer relationships; the “top of the hierarchy” or
“core” consists of a few large multi-national ASes that peer with
one another, and provide Internet access to most other ASes [2, 15–
17]. Given such findings, and our experimental results with real
paths, we come to a very powerful conclusion: only 30 ASes, all
in non-censorious countries, are sufficient for a DR infrastructure
that intercepts more than 90% of paths to important websites in
general. In such a case, besides the reduction in the number of
ASes compared to current solutions (about 30 times) this method
needs to be run only once, rather than separately for each censorious
country. Our further experiments indicate that this is indeed the
case – the power of these ASes is not limited to the top-100 websites,
they intercept over 90% of paths for other destinations as well. For
example, with nine case studies of censorious countries, we found
that these key ASes also intercept over 90% of the paths to 450
websites that are popular across these nations and also hosted
outside their respective network boundaries.
Our AS-level results suggest that censorious countries in the
Internet are less able to “route around decoys” than previously
thought. About 30 ASes – 0.055% of the world ASes – intercept
over 90% of paths to popular websites, and in particular, 99% of the
paths originating from China. Furthermore, if censorious regimes
choose to filter traffic along paths traversing the key ASes, they
affect customers outside their network boundaries, and the extent of
this “collateral damage” can be extremely high – for example, over
92% of all the network paths that traverse Chinese ASes originate
beyond its network boundaries. (Details in section 6.)
to these, using the approach described by Gao et al. [13] (involving
real BGP routing tables and inter-AS relationships [14]). We then
identified the “key” ASes – those which appear most frequently on
a large fraction of the paths. We find that ≈ 30 ASes appear in more
than 90% of the paths to our target sites.
Our approach in this first step is not general; clearly, the ad-
versary could block access to the entire Alexa top-10, to prevent
users’ traffic from reaching the DRs. So our second step is a study
of how the “hardness” of the problem – finding the set of ASes that
intercept several AS paths – varies as we change the set of possible
overt destinations to the top-10, 20, 30, 50, 100, or 200 web sites.
For our second contribution in this paper, we raise a new question.
DR placement is not limited to AS selection! A large AS has thou-
sands of routers; where exactly in the AS should DRs be placed? In
this first study that uses intra-AS mapping (viz. Rocketfuel [18]) to
answer the aforementioned question, we find that while the number
of ASes required for a world-wide DR framework is very small (30),
we need to replace on average 400 routers per AS with DRs.
We conclude that, while a global DR system may involve only
30 ASes, a practical one would still require placing over 11, 700
DRs in about 13 different countries. In fact, the problem remains
challenging even if we provide Decoy Routing to citizens of a single
country: against a very weak adversary, Syria (contained by only 3
ASes), a DR framework would involve 1, 117 routers. No existing
DR architectures have been shown to process requests at line rates
of network backbone routers2, nor has an implementation on exist-
ing high-speed routers been developed. Unless we can deploy Decoy
Routing on existing (or augmented) networking infrastructure, and
can handle the high speeds, we will need to replace infrastructure
at costs of over ten billion dollars (for example, for Level-3 Commu-
nications alone, i.e. AS 3356 and AS 3549, the cost is 1.4 billion USD
at Parulkar and McKeown’s [20] estimate of 885, 000 USD/ router),
plus implementation, downtime, and debugging costs.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED RESEARCH
This section presents the relevant background for our work, and a
brief discussion of how it fits into the existing literature.
2.1 Network Anti-censorship and Decoy
Routing
The general area of our work is the use of proxy servers to cir-
cumvent censorship. Popular anti-censorship solutions, such as
Tor [3]3, are no longer powerful enough when the adversary is
a sophisticated nation-state: there exist techniques to detect TLS
flows carrying Tor [21, 22]. More generally, traffic for most proxy
based solutions can be detected and censored [23, 24], even if cam-
ouflaged [25].
Decoy Routing [5] takes a new direction where proxying is per-
formed by special network routers called Decoy Routers. We sketch
the basic mechanism in brief.
• The user of DR is hosted within a censorious ISP network,
but wishes to communicate with network destinations cen-
sored by its ISP. To achieve this, it sends packets addressed
to an innocuous-looking website, known as the overt desti-
nation. (The packets are encrypted using TLS, so the ISP
cannot see the contents, and the header shows that they
are meant for an unfiltered destination.)
• These innocuous-appearing packets, allowed out of the
censoring ISP, carry a small, steganographic message, usu-
ally encoded in the protocol headers.
• On their way to the overt destination, if the packets pass
through a DR, the steganographic message acts as a secret
handshake. Instead of forwarding them, the DR decrypts
their payload (the key, the TLS shared secret, is also sent as
part of the secret message); establishes a new connection
to the filtered site - the true, covert destination; and sends
the payload to this covert destination.
Thus, a DR acts as a proxy, covertly communicating with a blocked
site on behalf of the user. This procedure, end-to-middle (E2M)
censorship circumvention, is shown in Figure 1. Actual implemen-
tations of Decoy Routing – Telex [7], Cirripede [6], TapDance [8],
Rebound [9] and Slitheen [10] – have different features (message
replay protection, tolerance of asymmetry in routing, inline block-
ing of traffic to/from overt destination, implementation of secret
handshake, etc.), but share the basic design outlined above. This
design decision stems from the realization that it is much harder
for the censor to prevent the packets passing through a router, than
2Which is of the order of several Tbps [19]
3Onion routing was originally designed to ensure anonymity over the Internet, but
as it tunnels encrypted messages through a distributed network of proxies, it is also
suitable for evading censorship.
it is to block an end host. But how hard it really is for the censor
to circumvent DRs, and where the routers should be placed, is an
active research question, as we discuss in the next sub-section.
Figure 1: Decoy Routing in Action: Clients in a censori-
ous ISP bypass the filter by sending packets apparently ad-
dressed to a non-filtered overt destination (OD). En route,
the packets traverse a DR, which sees the secret message;
identifies them for special handling; decrypts them; and
sends their payload to the real, covert destination (CD).
[Note: Current implementations cannot perform Decoy
Routing with just the router, they also require a DR station -
typically a server - for the “heavy lifting”, involving crypto-
graphic operations]
2.2 On The Placement of DRs
Where should DRs be placed in the Internet? This question was
first raised by the Cirripede project [6], whose authors claim that
(against an adversary who is ignorant of Decoy Routing), placing
DRs in just two tier-1 ASes is sufficient to serve all clients world-
wide.
The next major step, by Schuchard et al. [11], is to suggest that a
powerful adversary such as China will eventually figure out which
ASes have DRs in them, and simply redirect its traffic to avoid
these ASes – the Routing Around Decoys (RAD) attack. Mapping
the Internet at AS level (ASes and their connections), the authors
show that censor countries (China, Iran, etc.) have connections to
many ASes, and thus enough alternative paths to route around a
particular AS. Avoiding the top 100 ASes (by degree in the CAIDA
connectivity graph) would disconnect China from only 2.3% of web
destinations.
Houmansadr et al. [1] counter that, once we consider actual
routing – with directional business relationships between ASes,
rather than just graph connectivity – the RAD attack is too costly
to be feasible. They also question Schuchard et al.’s assumption that
DRs may be placed in randomly-chosen ASes. 86.2% of the ASes
on the Internet are origin ASes (i.e. they do not transport traffic of
other ASes); a random placement mostly chooses such ASes, and it
is possible to do much better if the ASes are chosen strategically.
The authors propose two ways to do this:
(1) Sorted placement. ASes that appear most frequently in the
adversary’s routing tables.
(2) Strategic random. ASes chosen randomly, but only among
those ASes that have a large enough customer-cone. 4
4Customer cone refers to customers, customers of customers, etc. In other words, a
selected AS must be a significant provider to other ASes.
But while this approach is better than random, it still computes a
separate, large set of ASes for every adversary (858 ASes for China,
835 for Venezuela, etc.).
Further, Kim et al. [9] also suggest a graph theoretic approach to
solve the problem, involving hypothetical network graphs, without
however considering how network routes are determined by inter-
AS relationships [26].
The first contribution of this paper is a new approach for placing
DRs: we select the ASes that appear most frequently in paths from
all ASes to popular websites (potential Overt Destinations), as
candidates for placing DRs – as estimated from actual routing tables.
In our experiments, we target multiple sets of target websites
(globally popular ones, those popular in selected censorious nations,
etc.), and consistently find that the same set of key ASes cover the
vast majority (> 90%) of routes to the target. (Genuine Internet BGP
routes, collected by Routeviews [27], not a simulation.) We suggest
that these “heavy-hitter” ASes are very likely the current “core”
of the Internet, as first found by Rexford et al [2], and are good
