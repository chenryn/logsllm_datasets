### 4.2. Summary of Observed Fault Diversity

Table 2 provides a summary from the perspective of the probable effects on a fault-tolerant server. Out of the 47 bugs that could be run on all four servers, 12 did not cause failures in any of the servers; these are Heisenbugs for the server for which they were reported and either non-existent or Heisenbugs for the other three servers. Thirty-one of these bugs caused a failure only in the server for which they were reported and not in the others, while four bugs caused coincident failures in two servers.

In addition to these 47 bugs, there are many bugs that could be run only on a subset of the four servers and thus on a fault-tolerant server built from this subset. The following sections in Table 2 show the number of bugs that could be run in each of these different combinations (four three-version combinations and six two-version combinations) and how many caused failures or coincident failures.

The last four columns in Table 2 show the 76 dialect-specific bugs, which could only be run in the server for which they were reported and therefore affect functionality that would not be available on a fault-tolerant diverse server.

### 4.3. Two-Version Combinations

We now examine more closely the two-version combinations of the four different servers in our study to see how many of the coincident failures are detectable in the 2-version systems. We define:

- **Detectable Failures**: Self-evident failures or those where servers return different incorrect results (the comparison algorithm must account for possible differences in the representation of correct results, e.g., different numbers of digits in the representation of floating-point numbers, padding of characters in strings, etc.). All failures affecting only one out of two (or at most n-1 out of n) versions are detectable.
- **Non-Detectable Failures**: Failures for which two (or more) servers return identical incorrect results.

Table 3 summarizes the results for each of the six possible two-version combinations. We only include bugs that could be run on both servers, excluding dialect-specific bugs. Only four of the 12 coincident failures we observed are non-detectable. We can see that diversity allows detection of failures for at least 94% of these bugs.

**Table 3. Summary of Results for the Two-Version Combinations**

| **Pairs of Servers** | **Total Number of Bug Scripts Run** | **Failure Observed (in at least one server)** | **Non-Self-Evident** | **One Out of Two Servers Failing** | **Self-Evident** | **Both Servers Failing** | **Non-Detectable** | **Detectable** |

### 5. Common Faults

We now discuss the bugs that caused coincident failures, as listed in Table 4. We provide some details about the affected functions and conjectures about the probable severity and frequency of failure as a function of the server's usage environment.

There were 13 bugs in total that were originally reported for one server but caused failure in another. Twelve of these caused a failure in both the server for which they were reported and another server. One bug (MSSQL bug report 56775) was reported for MSSQL, did not cause a failure in MSSQL (possible Heisenbug), but did cause a failure in PostgreSQL.
