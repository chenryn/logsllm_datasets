#### Description
In accordance with new pandas support in sklearn 0.20.0, I believe that we
should offer some runtime safety for users who chose to fit on dataframes,
that their column names and orderings should be checked on predict.
This is especially useful when pickling models and then using them in other
applications, potentially by other teams in your company or a long time after
generating them (and you've forgotten how they work.)
#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
Example:
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2,3], 'b':[3,2,1]})
    r = SVR()
    r.fit(df, [1,2,3])
    df = df.rename(columns={'a': 'c', 'b': 'd'})
    r.predict(df)
This works, but should raise an error.
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2,3], 'b':[3,2,1]})
    r = SVR()
    r.fit(df, [1,2,3])
    df = df[['b','a']]
    r.predict(df)
This works and returns **wrong values**. This should ~~raise an error~~ work
by selecting the features in the proper order.
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2,3], 'b':[3,2,1]})
    r = SVR()
    r.fit(df, [1,2,3])
    df['c'] = [2,1,3]
    r.predict(df)
This fails, but should actually work! Just select ['a','b'] from the dataframe
given.
