separating the passengers and baggage on the sending side, and then reuniting them
(hopefully!) on the destination side. When a passenger then passes through security and
additional stamp is often added to his/her ticket, indicating that the passenger has passed
through a security check. This information is used to ensure (e.g., by later checks for the
security information) secure transfer of people.

c)Timeatwhich1packetisreceivedatthedestinationhost=

time at which last (80o) packet is received  15 m sec+ 799 * 5m sec = 4.01sec . It
can be seen that delay in using message segmentation is significantly less (almost
1/3rd).

packets. Smaller packets have to queue behind enormous packets and suffer
unfair delays.
Packets have to be put in sequence at the destination.
1i.
Message segmentation results in many smaller packets. Since header size is
usually the same for all packets regardless of their size, with message
segmentation the total amount of header bytes is more.
Problem32
Yes, the delays in the applet correspond to the delays in the Problem 31.The propagation
delays affect the overall end-to-end delays both for packet switching and message
switching equally.
Problem33
There are F/S packets. Each packet is S=80 bits. Time at which the last packet is received
at the first router is
S +80F
 sec. At this time, the first F/S-2 packets are at the
destination, and the F/S-1 packet is at the second router. The last packet must then be
transmited by the first router and the second router, with each transmission taking

Problem34
The circuit-switched telephone networks and the Internet are connected together at
"gateways". When a Skype user (connected to the Internet) calls an ordinary telephone, a
circuit is established between a gateway and the telephone user over the circuit switched
network. The skype user's voice is sent in packets over the Internet to the gateway. At the
gateway, the voice signal is reconstructed and then sent over the circuit. In the other
direction, the voice signal is sent over the circuit switched network to the gateway. The
gateway packetizes the voice signal and sends the voice packets to the Skype user.

Chapter2ReviewQuestions
1.The Web: HTTP; file transfer: FTP; remote login: Telnet; e-mail: SMTP; BitTorrent
file sharing: BitTorrent protocol
2.Network architecture refers to the organization of the communication process into
layers (e.g., the five-layer Internet architecture). Application architecture, on the other
hand, is designed by an application developer and dictates the broad structure of the
application (e.g., client-server or P2P)-
3.The process which initiates the communication is the client; the process that waits to
be contacted is the server.
4. No. In a P2P file-sharing application, the peer that is receiving a file is typically the
client and the peer that is sending the file is typically the server.
5.The IP address of the destination host and the port number of the socket in the
destination process.
6. You would use UDP. With UDP, the transaction can be completed in one roundtrip
time (RTT) - the client sends the transaction request into a UDP socket, and the server
sends the reply back to the client's UDP socket. With TCP, a minimum of two RTTs
are needed - one to set-up the TCP connection, and another for the client to send the
request, and for the server to send back the reply.
7.One such example is remote word processing, for example, with Google docs
However, because Google docs runs over the Internet (using TCP), timing guarantees
are not provided.
8.a) Reliable data transfer
TCP provides a reliable byte-stream between client and server but UDP does not.
b) A guarantee that a certain value for throughput will be maintained
Neither
c) A guarantee that data will be delivered within a specified amount of time
Neither
d) Confidentiality (via encryption)
Neither
9.SSL operates at the application layer. The SSL socket takes unencrypted data from
the application layer, encrypts it and then passes it to the TCP socket. If the
application developer wants TCP to be enhanced with SSL, she has to include the
SSL code in the application.

## Page 22
10. A protocol uses handshaking if the two communicating entities first exchange control
packets before sending data to each other. SMTP uses handshaking at the application
layer whereas HTTP does not.
11. The applications associated with those protocols require that all application data be
received in the correct order and without gaps. TCP provides this service whereas
UDP does not.
12. When the user first visits the site, the server creates a unique identification number,
creates an entry in its back-end database, and returns this identification number as a
cookie number. This cookie number is stored on the user’s host and is managed by
the browser. During each subsequent visit (and purchase), the browser sends the
cookie number back to the site. Thus the site knows when this user (more precisely,
this browser) is visiting the site.
13. Web caching can bring the desired content “closer” to the user, possibly to the same
LAN to which the user’s host is connected. Web caching can reduce the delay for all
objects, even objects that are not cached, since caching reduces the traffic on links.
14. Telnet is not available in Windows 7 by default. to make it available, go to Control
Panel, Programs and Features, Turn Windows Features On or Off, Check Telnet
client. To start Telnet, in Windows command prompt, issue the following command
> telnet webserverver 80
where "webserver" is some webserver. After issuing the command, you have
established a TCP connection between your client telnet program and the web server.
Then type in an HTTP GET message. An example is given below:
cs Telnet utopia.poly.edu
GET/index.htmlHTTP/1.1
If-nodified-since:Fri,18May 20B7 09:23:24 GHI
：
EIag:*1631-3a3-3c6d478b"
Since the index.html page in this web server was not modified since Fri, 18 May 2007
09:23:34 GMT, and the above commands were issued on Sat, 19 May 2007, the
server returmed "304 Not Modified". Note that the first 4 lines are the GET message
and header lines inputed by the user, and the next 4 lines (starting from HTTP/1.1 304
Not Modified) is the response from the web server.

From: This indicates the email address of the sender of the mail. In the given
example, the sender is “PI:EMAIL
To: This field indicates the email address of the receiver of the mail. In the example,
the receiver is “PI:EMAIL"
Subject: This gives the subject of the mail (if any specified by the sender). In the
example, the subject specified by the sender is “Test mail"
Date: The date and time when the mail was sent by the sender. In the example, the
sender sent the mail on 19th May 2007, at time 23:52:36 GMT.
Mime-version: MIME version used for the mail. In the example, it is 1.0.
Content-type: The type of content in the body of the mail message. In the example, it
is "text/html".
Return-Path: This specifies the email address to which the mail will be sent if the
receiver of this mail wants to reply to the sender. This is also used by the sender’s
mail server for bouncing back undeliverable mail messages of mailer-daemon error
messages. In the example, the return path is “PI:EMAIL"
18. With download and delete, after a user retrieves its messages from a POP server, the
messages are deleted. This poses a problem for the nomadic user, who may want to
access the messages from many different machines (office PC, home PC, etc.). In the
download and keep configuration, messages are not deleted after the user retrieves the
messages. This can also be inconvenient, as each time the user retrieves the stored
messages from a new machine, all of non-deleted messages will be transferred to the
19. Yes an organization's mail server and Web server can have the same alias for a host
name. The MX record is used to map the mail server's host name to its IP address.
20. You should be able to see the sender's IP address for a user with an .edu email
address. But you will not be able to see the sender's IP address if the user uses a gmail
aiccount.
21. It is not necessary that Bob will also provide chunks to Alice. Alice has to be in the
top 4 neighbors of Bob for Bob to send out chunks to her; this might not occur even if
Alice provides chunks to Bob throughout a 30-second interval.
---
## Page 25
22. Recall that in BitTorrent, a peer picks a random peer and optimistically unchokes the
peer for a short period of time. Therefore, Alice will eventually be optimistically
unchoked by one of her neighbors, during which time she will receive chunks from
that neighbor.
23. The overlay network in a P2P file sharing system consists of the nodes  participating
in the file sharing system and the logical links between the nodes. There is a logical
link (an “edge” in graph theory terms) from node A to node B if there is a semi
permanent TCP connection between A and B. An overlay network does not include
routers.
24. One server placement philosophy is called Enter Deep, which enter deep into the
access networks of Internet Service Providers, by deploying server clusters in access
ISPs all over the world. The goal is to reduce delays and increase throughput
between end users and the CDN servers. Another philosophy is Bring Home, which
bring the ISPs home by building large CDN server clusters at a smaller number of
sites and typically placing these server clusters in IXPs (Internet Exchange Points)
This Bring Home design typically results in lower maintenance and management cost,
compared with the enter-deep design philosophy.
25. Other than network-related factors, there are some important factors to consider, such
as load-balancing (clients should not be directed to overload clusters), diurnal effects,
variations across DNS servers within a network, limited availability of rarely
accessed video, and the need to alleviate hot-spots that may arise due to popular video
content.
Reference paper:
Torres, Ruben, et al. "Dissecting video server selection strategies in the YouTube
CDN." The 31st IEEE International Conference on. Distributed Computing Systems
(ICDCS), 2011.
Another factor to consider is ISP delivery cost  the clusters may be chosen so that
specific ISPs are used to carry CDN-to-client traffic, taking into account the different
cost structures in the contractual relationships between ISPs and cluster operators.
26. With the UDP server, there is no welcoming socket, and all data from different clients
enters the server through this one socket. With the TCP server, there is a welcoming
socket, and each time a client initiates a connection to the server, a new socket is
created. Thus, to support n simultaneous connections, the server would need n+/
sockets.
27. For the TCP application, as soon as the client is executed, it attempts to initiate a TCP
connection with the server. If the TCP server is not running, then the client will fail to
make a connection. For the UDP application, the client does not initiate connections
(or attempt to communicate with the UDP server) immediately upon execution

Problem2
SMS (Short Message Service) is a technology that allows the sending and receiving of
text messages between mobile phones over cellular networks. One SMS message can
contain data of 140 bytes and it supports languages internationally. The maximum size of
a message can be 160 7-bit characters, 140 8-bit characters, or 70 16-bit characters. SMS
is realized through the Mobile Application Part (MAP) of the SS#7 protocol, and the
Short Message protocol is defined by 3GPP TS 23.040 and 3GPP TS 23.041. In addition,
MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) extends the capability of original text messages,
and support sending photos, longer text messages, and other content.
photos, audios or videos that we send to iOS devices and Macs over cellular data network
or WiFi. Apple’s iMessage is based on a proprietary, binary protocol APNs (Apple Push
Notification Service).
WhatsApp Messenger is an instant messenger service that supports many mobile
platforms such as iOS, Android, Mobile Phone, and Blackberry. WhatsApp users can
send each other unlimited images, texts, audios, or videos over cellular data network or
WiFi. WhatsApp uses the XMPP protocol (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol).
iMessage and WhatsApp are different than SMS because they use data plan to send
messages and they work on TCP/IP networks, but SMS use the text messaging plan we
photos, videos, files, etc., while the original SMS can only send text message. Finally,
iMessage and WhatsApp can work via WiFi, but SMS cannot.

Problem 4
a)The document request was http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/cs453/index.html. The Host :
field indicates the server's name and /cs453/index.html indicates the file name.
b) The browser is running HTTP version 1.1, as indicated just before the first 
pair.
c)The browser is requesting a persistent connection, as indicated by the Connection:
keep-alive.
d) This is a trick question. This information is not contained in an HTTP message
anywhere. So there is no way to tell this from looking at the exchange of HTTP
messages alone. One would need information from the IP datagrams (that carried the
TCP segment that carried the HTTP GET request) to answer this question.
e)Mozilla/5.0. The browser type information is needed by the server to send different
versions of the same object to different types of browsers.

a)The status code of 200 and the phrase OK indicate that the server was able to locate
the document successfully. The reply was provided on Tuesday, 07 Mar 2008
12:39:45 Greenwich Mean Time.
b) The document index.html was last modified on Saturday 10 Dec 2005 18:27:46
GMT.
c)There are 3874 bytes in the document being returned.
d)The first five bytes of the returned document are : <!doc. The server agreed to a
persistent connection, as indicated by the Connection: Keep-Alive field
Problem6
a)Persistent connections are discussed in section 8 of RFC 2616 (the real goal of this
question was to get you to retrieve and read an RFC).  Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.2.1 of
the RFC indicate that either the client or the server can indicate to the other that it is
going to close the persistent connection. It does so by including the connection-token
"close" in the Connection-header field of the http request/reply.
b)HTTP does not provide any encryption services.
c) (From RFC 2616) "Clients that use persistent connections should limit the number of
simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server. A single-user client

## Page 28
d)Yes. (From RFC 2616) “A client might have started to send a new request at the same
time that the server has decided to close the "idle" connection. From the server's point
of view, the connection is being closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of
view, a request is in progress."

Problem9
a)The time to transmit an object of size L over a link or rate R is L/R. The average time
is the average size of the object divided by R:
  (850,000 bits)/(15,000,000 bits/sec) = .0567 sec
The traffic intensity on the link is given by β(16 requests/sec)(.0567 sec/request) =
0.907. Thus, the average access delay is (.0567 sec)/(1 - .907) ≈ .6 seconds. The total
average response time is therefore .6 sec + 3 sec = 3.6 sec.
---
## Page 29
b) The traffic intensity on the access link is reduced by 60% since the 60% of the
requests are satisfied within the institutional network. Thus the average access delay
is (.0567 sec)/[1  (.4)(.907)] = .089 seconds. The response time is approximately
zero if the request is satisfied by the cache (which happens with probability .6); the
average response time is .089 sec + 3 sec = 3.089 sec for cache misses (which
sec) = 1.24 seconds. Thus the average response time is reduced from 3.6 sec to 1.24
sec.
Problem 10
Note that each downloaded object can be completely put into one data packet. Let Tp
denote the one-way propagation delay between the client and the server.
First consider parallel downloads using non-persistent connections. Parallel downloads
would allow 10 connections to share the 150 bits/sec bandwidth, giving each just 15
bits/sec. Thus, the total time needed to receive all objects is given by:
（d +091/000001 + d+091/00 + d+091/00 + d+091/00)
