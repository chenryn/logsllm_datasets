the T1 deployers tend to carry most of the trafﬁc in the topology,
hence providing security at this set of central points should yield
the greatest adoptability.
We investigate how different path metrics and adversary distri-
butions affect the critical threshold values. Table 1 lists the metrics
we vary in our simulation and Figure 8 shows the critical thresholds
we observe with those conditions. In each experiment we start the
adoption by deploying the secure routing protocol on the 25 high-
est degree ASes in the topology. We observe that the relative values
of the critical thresholds for each set of security schemes does not
change signiﬁcantly as we vary our path metric and the adversary
distribution.
In the strong attacker model, we observe that using OA results
in lower adoptability than full security. On the other hand, OA+1
yields adoptability very close to that of full security. We hypoth-
esize that the similar results of OA+1 and full security are due to
the critical threshold dynamics of the adoption process. Since the
adoption process experiences positive feedback which drives ASes
rapidly to reach full adoption once a sufﬁcient number of ASes
have made the decision to adopt the protocol, early stages are par-
ticularly crucial. Recalling Figures 3 and 4, the main difference
between full path security and OA+1 is that the attacker can spoof
a metric of 2 in OA+1 and a metric of 1 + d(C, M) in full security.
However, in the critical early stages of deployment, it is unlikely
that D would have completely surrounded itself with secure ASes.
Hence, d(C, M) is typically 1. As a result, both OA+1 and full path
security share nearly identical properties in early deployment. It is
only in mid-deployment, when a signiﬁcant fraction of ASes have
already adopted, that the two schemes begin to diverge, where full
path security yields improved security beneﬁts through its full path
authentication. However, if adoption is able to proceed to mid-
deployment, positive feedback is sufﬁcient to drive both schemes
all the way to full adoption regardless of the improved beneﬁts of
full security. Hence both schemes show very close adoptability
characteristics.
7. ANALYSIS: WEAK ATTACKER MODEL
In this section, we perform the security analysis for each of the
ﬁve security schemes under the weak attacker model described in
Section 4.2. Under this attacker model, we assume that the attacker
is only able to read incoming BGP updates at the malicious AS; it
is not privy to other BGP messages elsewhere in the Internet even
if those messages are unencrypted.
In particular, for any given preﬁx, a malicious AS M will receive
one or more updates for that preﬁx. Since we assume that BGP uses
shortest path routing, only the shortest such path is of relevance to
the malicious AS. This path is indicated in Figure 9 as the path
from D to M traversing ASes X, Y and Z. The attacker must now
use this information to advertise a short route to some AS W in the
path in order to divert the legitimate path through itself.
7.1 Analysis Unchanged: OA, OA+1, soBGP
The security analysis for Origin Authentication (OA), First-hop
Authentication (OA+1), and soBGP (Routing Topology Path Veri-
ﬁcation) remain unchanged under the weak attacker model as com-
pared with the strong attacker model (see Section 5). We discuss
each in turn.
OA: The attacker remains free to perform preﬁx hijacking if either
one of D or W do not have origin authentication deployed; other-
wise, it claims a direct link to D and performs path spooﬁng as per
Figure 2.
OA+1: The adversary is free to perform path spooﬁng as in Fig-
ure 3, with one minor variation: instead of spooﬁng a false link
to the ﬁrst AS (F1) in the legitimate path, it spoofs a false link to
the ﬁrst AS on the path to itself (F2 in Figure 9). The end result is
identical; the attack succeeds if 2 + d(M,W) < d(D,W).
soBGP: In soBGP (or any Routing Topology Path Veriﬁcation pro-
tocol), BGP routes are veriﬁed against a database of known rout-
ing information for all the ASes that have deployed the security
scheme. We assume that access to the information in this database
is public—AS routing information can already be readily deduced
through such mechanisms as RouteViews. Furthermore, whether
or not ASes are soBGP speakers can be easily determined by mon-
itoring their route advertisements. Hence, the task of the attacker is
identical for both the weak attacker model and the strong attacker
model. By querying the database (or through any other information
channel), the attacker determines the closest non-deploying AS C
to the originator D. The attacker then spoofs a short path from D to
itself through C, exactly as in Figure 4.
7.2 S-BGP (Path Authentication)
Path Authentication, as represented by S-BGP, is one of the two
classes of protocols that behaves differently under the weak at-
tacker model than the strong attacker model. Under the weak at-
tacker model with S-BGP, the attacker is no longer able to eaves-
drop on messages sent to any potential non-deploying ASes that
are close to the originator. In particular, the attacker is not always
able to perform the attack described in Section 5.3, because this
attack requires the attacker to have eavesdropped on the BGP up-
date sent to the closest insecure AS C from the originator AS D,
but this AS may not be on the path to the malicious AS M (see
Figure 9). In fact, the only useful messages accessible to M are the
BGP update messages that are received by M from D. For simplic-
ity, we consider the case where only one such update message was
received (indicated in Figure 9 as the path from D to M through
ASes X,Y, Z). Extension to the case where multiple messages were
received is straightforward. Suppose X is the ﬁrst non-deploying
AS in this path; all previous ASes are S-BGP speakers. Since this
represents the ﬁrst break in the chain of signatures, M can remove
any security information appended after X, and spoof a path by
claiming a direct link to X. This is the best M can do since M can-
not remove any of the authentication information prior to X as all
the ASes prior to X are secure. Therefore, attacker can hijack the
path from S to D only if d(D, X) + 1 + d(M,W) < d(D,W).
7.3 SPV (Retroactive Path Integrity)
Under SPV (or any similar Retroactive Path Integrity protocol),
the adversary’s task is further complicated by the fact that subse-
quent ASes in the path can add cryptographic information to repair
the break in the chain of security caused by non-deploying ASes.

tacker Model.
For example, suppose that in Figure 9, X and Z are non-deploying
ASes, and Y is the closest SPV-speaking AS to M on the path. Un-
der S-BGP the attacker could spoof a direct link to AS X as de-
scribed in Section 7.2. However, SPV prevents the attacker from
stripping off the cryptographic signatures of AS Y because AS Y
will have added the necessary signatures to close the break in the
chain (for example, by performing signatures on behalf of AS X)
before adding its own signature. This means that the attacker is now
restricted to spooﬁng a direct link to the ﬁrst non-deploying AS (in
this case, AS Z) after the latest secure AS in the path received by
the malicious AS (in this case, AS Y ). The attack is successful only
if d(D, Z) + 1 + d(M,W) < d(D,W).
8. RESULTS: WEAK ATTACKER
In the weak attacker model, we run the simulation on a smaller
generated model of 1000 ASes. For cross-validation of the gen-
erated model, when we ran our analysis for the Strong Attacker
Model on the smaller model topology, we observed the same be-
havior as in the larger topology extracted from RouteViews, which
indicated that the generated model exhibited properties close enough
to the actual AS-level topology for our purposes. We chose the 5
highest degree ASes (which represent Tier-1 ASes) from the gen-
erated topology as our initial adopters.
Figure 10 shows the critical thresholds of each of the ﬁve classes
of schemes. The critical thresholds of OA, OA+1, and soBGP re-
mained unchanged from the strong attacker model since their secu-
rity analyses were identical for both attacker models. On the other
hand, SPV and S-BGP both showed signiﬁcant (approx. 10×) in-
tion set to verify that the adoptability relationships between each
class of schemes holds for different initial conditions. As our al-
ternative initial adoption sets, we chose (1) the top 5 ASes which
originated the largest amounts of IP space, and (2) 5 ASes at ran-
dom from the entire set of ASes. Figure 11 shows that the relative
adoptabilities between the schemes hold as we vary the initial con-
ditions.
Similarly, we vary the trafﬁc metric and the adversary distribu-
tion to observe their effect on critical threshold. As before, we
used the 5 highest degree ASes as our initial adopters. The dif-
ferent trafﬁc metrics and adversary distributions are the same as
the ones investigated for the strong attacker model (see Table 1).
Again we note that the relative adoptabilities of the ﬁve classes of
schemes remain stable despite different path metrics and adversary
distributions.
9. DISCUSSION
Current research on protocol design focuses on exploring var-
ious tradeoffs between security and implementation cost. How-
ever, such a limited set of metrics is insufﬁcient to adequately in-
form researchers as to the most desirable tradeoffs in the design
space. For example, there exists no method to quantify how much
a given security property contributes to the likelihood of a protocol
to be widely adopted. Given two protocols, one with a strong se-
curity property and high implementation cost, and another with a
weaker security property and lower implementation cost, it is un-
clear which protocol is in fact the more feasible technology.
Since the “security” provided by a protocol is a set of qualita-
tive properties describing how the protocol is resistant to various
attacks, simply examining the security of a protocol does not quan-
tify the relative contributions of each property to the protocol’s at-
tractiveness to potential implementors since there is no ordering
relation on the set of all possible combinations of security proper-
ties. Our methodology for extracting a critical threshold measure of
adoptability through simulation allows us to provide one possible
ordering relation, allowing researchers to compare the attractive-
ness of various sets of security properties under any given context.
A concise deﬁnition of the metric of adoptability is as follows:
Deﬁnition 2 The adoptability of a given (security) protocol is a
measure of the attractiveness or usefulness of the protocol’s (se-
curity) properties in terms of how strongly these properties might
motivate eventual full adoption of the protocol in the Internet.
“Security” is parenthesized because the more general deﬁnition
of adoptability can be used for arbitrary protocol properties, as long
as the utility of these properties to the adopter can be mathemati-
cally modeled in some way. In this paper, we consider only security
protocols. Hence, for a given adoption context, adoptability can be
viewed as a security metric, i.e., it measures only the strength of
the protocol’s security properties.
