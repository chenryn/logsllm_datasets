User: In perl debugger I can use DB::get_fork_TTY() to debug both parent and child process in different terminals.  Is there anything similar in python debugger?
Or, is there any good way to debug fork in python?
Assistant: The debugger in pyCharm does this nicely. It seems to use gdb with python support to accomplish that, however all the tutorials on how to do this with gdb by Hand which I've found so far didn't work for me. In pyCharm it just works.
