## Abstract
Traffic exchange services enable members to drive traffic to their websites from a diverse pool of IP addresses in return for visiting other members' sites. This study examines the landscape of traffic exchanges to characterize their composition, usage, and monetization. We find that these services range from manual exchanges requiring CAPTCHA solving between page views to automated surfing tools that require no user action. By analyzing month-long datasets, we observe a high prevalence of URLs for services that pay users for content views, with at least 30% of requested impressions involving referrer spoofing, a form of impression fraud. Additionally, by making purchases, we estimate that some exchanges deliver visits from approximately 200,000 unique IP addresses, with a significant portion originating from cloud hosting services.

## 1. Introduction
A system has emerged to provide free traffic from a diverse pool of IP addresses through the principle of exchange: members visit each other’s websites, receiving visits to their own in return. Large exchanges can potentially "launder" clicks, making them appear more legitimate than they are.

Understanding the significance and evolution of such exchanges requires identifying the motives of participants. One key motive is advertising fraud. Advertisers generally desire "organic" visitors—truly engaged users. Unscrupulous publishers, however, seek cheap, inorganic traffic to fraudulently earn from purported impressions and clicks on displayed ads. Simple forms of bogus traffic can be detected by observing disproportionate impressions or clicks from the same IP addresses over a short period. Fraudsters, therefore, aim to diversify the apparent pool of users visiting their pages to evade detection.

Over the past decade, various schemes have emerged to generate fraudulent traffic from diverse sources. Botnets, such as ZeroAccess, Fiesta, and 7cy, are well-suited for this purpose. Another approach involves pay-per-view networks, which embed websites as pop-unders. Our study focuses on traffic exchanges, which allow participants to bring disparate traffic to their sites at a low cost. In these exchanges, participants perform N clicks, all from their IP address, to receive N (or fewer) visits to their chosen URLs. The diversity of the exchange's membership makes the incoming traffic appear dispersed.

We examine the world of traffic exchanges, finding a wide variety of offerings and usage paradigms beyond just ad fraud. These range from manual exchanges requiring CAPTCHA solving to automated surfing tools that allow customization of time-on-page, User-Agent, and Referer fields. Some exchanges are free, while others charge for premium services. By observing both the origin and destination of traffic, we estimate the size of exchanges and understand the strategies pursued by their users. We find that some exchanges deliver traffic from tens of thousands of IP addresses, with a large fraction generated by bots in cloud hosting services, often targeting websites that generate multiple impression requests to ad networks. Referrer spoofing is a major category of fraud observed.

Our work differs from previous studies in two ways: First, it is the first large-scale examination of exchange networks primarily designed for free traffic exchange, though they also offer paid traffic. Second, the targets of traffic exchanges may differ from those of paid services, as participants barter for traffic with reciprocal traffic, potentially pursuing different monetization strategies.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: §2 covers related work, §3 provides background on different categories of exchanges, §4 describes the characteristics of the exchanges studied, §5 presents measurements of popular target websites, §6 measures the size of the exchanges, and §7 discusses our findings and estimates the volume of money flowing through the exchanges.

## 2. Related Work
Traffic generation and advertising fraud have been extensively studied. Research on advertising fraud falls into three categories: (i) impression fraud and markets for buying traffic, (ii) characterization studies on click fraud, and (iii) detection of fraudulent clicks.

Zhang et al. [37] compare the quality of traffic from providers who promise bulk visitors for a monthly fee to traffic from traditional keyword auctions and sponsored banner ads. They find that most providers deliver inorganic/automated traffic, with only one provider delivering seemingly organic traffic via a paid-to-view scheme.

Springborn et al. [34] study impression fraud by buying views from multiple traffic sources and investigating the referer field. They identify pay-per-view (PPV) networks where participating websites load other websites as hidden pop-unders. They estimate that these networks deliver around 150 million impressions per day, generating approximately 500 million ad impressions. They suggest countermeasures like checking the referer against a blacklist and verifying viewport dimensions.

We are unaware of any academic work on view-fraud botnets, but two botnets, Chameleon and TDSS, have received blogging attention. Chameleon, estimated to consist of 120,000 machines, targeted 200 websites, clearing cookies to appear as new users [9]. TDSS leveraged the ClickIce Ad Exchange to deliver bot traffic to publishers, defrauding display advertisers [8].

Recent years have seen characterization studies of click fraud bots. Miller et al. [31] study the Fiesta and 7cy clickbot families, finding that they use the pay-per-click model to deliver traffic to publishers. Pearce et al. [33] estimate that the ZeroAccess botnet induced losses of $100,000 per day until its takedown in late 2013. Stone-Gross et al. [35] document fraudulent activities in online ad exchanges from the perspective of a participating ad network.

Detection of fraudulent traffic has received less attention due to limited access to data from advertising networks. Haddadi [27] proposes using "bluff" ads to detect click fraud. Dave et al. [24] develop a technique to estimate the fraction of click spam from the perspective of an advertiser, independently from the ad network's estimates.

Click fraud is one of several web-based fraud phenomena that have surged in recent years. Kanich et al. [28] study the returns from large spam campaigns, Grier et al. [26] characterize spam on Twitter, Christin [23] details activity on an underground market for illicit goods, and McCoy et al. [30] study affiliate programs used in selling medications online. These studies reveal complex phenomena and inform efforts to combat fraud.

## 3. Background
We surveyed the landscape of traffic exchanges through online searches, compiling a list of 50 exchanges and manually investigating their features. We identified two main categories: (i) generic, which offer traffic exchange services for any website, and (ii) social media promotion, which are designed to increase views, likes, comments, and followers on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.

This paper focuses on generic exchanges, examining why participants direct free traffic to specific destinations. We further classify generic exchanges into:
- **Manual**: Require solving a CAPTCHA for each website view.
- **Basic Autosurf**: Provide a surf link that automatically fetches and displays the next site.
- **Advanced Autosurf**: Offer a tool/plugin that generates custom webpage view requests with configurable Referer and User-Agent fields.

We selected nine exchanges based on their popularity in Google search results, the Black Hat World forum, and traffic exchange ranking lists. These include two manual exchanges (EasyHits4U and HitSafari), two basic autosurf exchanges (247AutoHits and 10Khits), four advanced autosurf exchanges (HitLeap, eBesucher, Jingling, Otohits), and one social media promotion exchange (EnhanceViews Autowatcher) for comparison.

## 4. Exchange Characteristics
In this section, we provide an overview of the exchanges' characteristics, including account pricing and configuration options for delivered traffic. Table 1 summarizes these characteristics.

### 4.1 Earning and Using Traffic Exchange Credits
All exchanges, except Jingling, require users to sign up with a valid email address. Some offer premium memberships with better exchange ratios, bonus points, or enhanced functionality. Registered members earn credits by viewing or running the provided tool, which communicates with the exchange's Command & Control server to fetch URLs. Key features include:

- **Account-to-Machine Ratio**: Manual exchanges restrict one account to one IP address, while autosurf exchanges allow multiple IP addresses.
- **Exchange Ratio**: Free accounts typically have an exchange ratio of 0.5–0.7, meaning users do not receive the same number of visits as they provide. Premium levels sometimes offer ratios greater than 1.
- **Credits/Cash-Out**: Most exchanges offer traffic exchange credits, with EasyHits4U and eBesucher allowing conversion to cash. EasyHits4U pays $0.30 per 1,000 views with a minimum cash-out of $3, while eBesucher pays $0.02 per 1,000 views with a similar minimum.

### 4.2 Controls Offered for Views
Exchanges offer various capabilities to make traffic resemble organic user behavior, including:

- **Website Slots**: The number of URLs a member can have active for viewing. Free accounts typically offer 3–15 slots, while paid accounts offer more, sometimes unlimited.
- **Views Timing**: The duration a website is viewed, affecting whether the view is credited for payment purposes. Manual and basic autosurf exchanges offer short views, while advanced autosurf exchanges allow customization.

| Exchange | Requires Account? |
|----------|-------------------|
| HitSafari | Yes               |
| EasyHits4U | Yes              |
| 10Khits | Yes               |
| 247AutoHits | Yes             |
| HitLeap | Yes               |
| eBesucher | Yes              |
| Jingling | No                |
| Otohits | Yes               |
| EnhanceViews | Yes            |

This structured approach provides a comprehensive and professional overview of the research, making it clear and easy to follow.
