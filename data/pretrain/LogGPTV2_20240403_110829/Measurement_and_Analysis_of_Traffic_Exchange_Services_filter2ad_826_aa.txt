Abstract
Trafﬁc exchange services enable members to bring trafﬁc to their
websites from a diverse pool of IP addresses, in return for visiting
sites of other members. We examine the world of trafﬁc exchanges
to characterize their makeup, usage, and monetization. We ﬁnd
that the ecosystem includes a range of services, from manual ex-
changes where participants must solve CAPTCHAs between suc-
cessive page views, to exchanges that provide tools that automati-
cally surf without requiring any user action. By “milking” a sam-
ple of these exchanges, we analyze month-long datasets to examine
the nature of URLs that members submit to them. We ﬁnd a wide
prevalence of URLs for services that pay users in return for views to
their content, and at least 30% of the requested impressions are for
pages that clearly participate in a class of impression fraud called
referrer spooﬁng. We also analyze the size and composition of
a sample of these exchange networks by making purchases, ﬁnd-
ing that the exchanges delivered visits from roughly 200K unique
IP addresses, and that in some exchange networks, the majority of
visits came from cloud hosting services.

INTRODUCTION
An eco-system has arisen to provide free trafﬁc from a diverse
pool of IP addresses using the principle of exchange: members visit
each other’s websites, in return receiving visits to their own web-
sites. Exchanges of signiﬁcant size can potentially enable members
to effectively “launder” clicks to their sites, making them appear of
a much richer nature than in reality.

Understanding the signiﬁcance and likely evolution of such ex-
changes requires identifying the motives of the participants. One
obvious motive—though not the only one, it turns out—concerns
forms of advertising fraud.
Internet advertisers generally desire
“organic” visitors, i.e., truly engaged users. Unscrupulous pub-
lishers of Internet content, however, can seek to receive cheap in-
organic trafﬁc in order to fraudulently earn from purported impres-
sions and clicks received on the advertisements they display. Ad-
vertisers can identify simple forms of bogus trafﬁc by observing
impressions or clicks disproportionately due to the same IP ad-
dresses over a short period of time. Fraudsters in turn will seek
ways to spread out the apparent pool of users visiting their pages to
thwart such detection.
Indeed, over the past decade different schemes for generating
fraudulent trafﬁc from a diverse pool have arisen. By their sheer
size, botnets are well suited to generate trafﬁc from disparate
sources, as evidenced by impression and click-fraud botnets such as
ZeroAccess, Fiesta, and 7cy [31, 33]. Another approach, pay-per-
view networks, embeds websites as pop-unders in other websites,
seemingly delivering the visitors of one website to another [34].
A third approach, one that our study examines in detail, is the use
of trafﬁc exchanges to pool clicks, allowing participants to bring
disparate trafﬁc to their sites on-the-cheap. In such exchange net-
works, participants performing N clicks for the exchange, all com-
ing from the participant’s IP address, in return reap credits to re-
ceive a different N visits (or somewhat fewer, depending on the
exchange’s structure) delivered to URLs of their choosing. Since
the exchange has many members, the trafﬁc arriving at each mem-
ber’s target site appears quite dispersed.
More broadly, we examine the world of trafﬁc exchanges, ﬁnd-
ing a wide variety of offerings, and usage paradigms beyond just
ad fraud. The offerings range from manual exchanges, where par-
ticipants must solve CAPTCHAs between successive clicks, to ex-
changes that provide tools that automatically surf without requiring
any user action, and allow customization of time-on-page, User-
Agent, and Referer ﬁelds. Some exchanges are free, while others
charge for certain levels of service. We study several prominent
exchanges in each category, casting light on this little-studied phe-
nomenon and the monetization it supports.
By lurking as a non-active exchange participant, we observe both
the origin (which IP addresses) and the destination (what websites)
of trafﬁc in circulation. This allows us to estimate the size of ex-
changes and understand the strategies pursued by those using them.
We ﬁnd that some exchanges deliver trafﬁc from tens of thousands
of IP addresses. A large fraction of the trafﬁc that ﬂows through
the autosurf exchanges is generated by bots running in cloud host-
ing services, and terminates on websites that generate a multitude
of impression requests to ad networks. Such referrer spooﬁng ad
1fraud makes up one of the major categories we observed [35, 25].
In contrast, members of the manual exchanges appear to indeed
reﬂect the sought-after demographic of the ads displayed there.
Two factors distinguish our work from previous studies on traf-
ﬁc generation. First, while there have been studies of services that
deliver bulk trafﬁc for money, ours is the ﬁrst large-scale examina-
tion of exchange networks primarily designed for free exchange of
trafﬁc amongst participants, though they also offer trafﬁc for pur-
chase. Second, the targets of trafﬁc exchanges potentially differ
in character from those for paid sites; since participants barter for
their trafﬁc with reciprocal trafﬁc, they may pursue different mon-
etization strategies from those who pay for trafﬁc.
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows: § 2 covers related
work and § 3 provides basic background on the different categories
of exchanges. § 4 describes the characteristics of the exchanges we
study. § 5 describes our measurements of popular target websites
in the exchanges. In § 6 we measure the size of the exchanges in
terms of unique participants and provide estimates of the impres-
sions these exchanges serve per day. In § 7 we discuss our ﬁnd-
ings and provide rough estimates of the volume of money ﬂowing
through the exchanges.
2. RELATED WORK
Trafﬁc generation and advertising fraud have received consider-
able study. Work on advertising fraud lies in three categories: (i)
impression fraud and markets for buying trafﬁc, (ii) characteriza-
tion studies on click fraud, and (iii) detection of fraudulent clicks.
Zhang et al. study the quality of trafﬁc delivered by trafﬁc
providers who promise bulk visitors for a monthly cost, and com-
pare that to the trafﬁc obtained from traditional keyword auctions
and sponsored banner ads in search results [37]. They purchase
trafﬁc from these providers, and based on characterization of mouse
activity, sub-page views, and timing of visits on their websites,
ﬁnd that these providers mostly deliver inorganic/automated traf-
ﬁc; only one of the providers delivered seemingly organic trafﬁc
via a paid-to-view scheme for recruiting visitors.
The work of Springborn et al. on impression fraud appears most
relevant to our paper [34]. The authors bought views from multi-
ple trafﬁc sources and studied how the trafﬁc is delivered to their
honeypot websites by investigating the referer ﬁeld. They identify
various pay-per-view (PPV) networks, in which participating web-
sites load multiple other websites as pop-unders, i.e., in windows
hidden behind the active browser window. This way, whenever a
legitimate user arrives at the participating website, they unknow-
ingly also visit the websites loaded as pop-unders. By mining the
publicly available Common Crawl Dataset [7], the authors identify
≈ 11K unique domains that embed PPV tags, similar to standard
ad tags, from the ten networks they study. By looking at the trafﬁc
statistics of these websites at MuStat [19], they estimate that these
networks deliver on the order of 150M impressions per day to web-
sites, which in turn load up ≈ 500M ad impressions per day. Based
on this analysis, the authors suggest simple countermeasures, to
the effect of checking the referer against a blacklist of PPV net-
works/publishers that participate in these networks, and checking
the viewport dimensions to make sure that the ad is indeed dis-
played in a visible area in a browser. Pay-per-view networks differ
from trafﬁc exchange networks in how they generate trafﬁc and
their business model. While trafﬁc exchange networks often of-
fer free trafﬁc using the principle of exchange, pay-per-view net-
works generate trafﬁc using participating websites, to whom they
pay cheap CPM (cost per thousand impressions) rates, and then sell
the generated trafﬁc at a proﬁt.
We are unaware of any work on view-fraud botnets in the aca-
demic literature. However, at least two botnets intended for view
fraud have received blogging attention: (i) The Chameleon bot-
net estimated to consist of ≈ 120K machines targeted a set of 200
websites, and repeatedly cleared cookies on the victim’s browser
to appear as a new user on every visit to the website [9]; (ii) The
TDSS botnet, which leveraged the ClickIce Ad Exchange to deliver
bot trafﬁc to various publishers, who in turn defrauded display ad-
vertisers [8]. This botnet utilized the pay-per-click model of the
ClickIce Exchange to request text ads that contained a clickable
publisher link. TDSS bots have the following capabilities: (i) de-
liver trafﬁc to publishers by visiting the clickable link; some pub-
lishers optimize their webpages for this bot trafﬁc—if a real user
visits, they are shown pages with content, but if the bot requests the
same page, a page with only ads is displayed, (ii) use the browser
cookies of the infected user to make the ad networks on the pub-
lisher’s website believe that the ad-slot is for a high-value user, and
(iii) spoof mouse, scroll, and click events on the target webpages.
Recent years have seen characterization studies of click fraud
bots. Miller et al. studied the Fiesta and 7cy clickbot families to
understand the click fraud techniques they employ [31]. For Fiesta,
they observe that, similar to TDSS, the pay-per-click model is used
to deliver trafﬁc to publishers rather than directly to the advertis-
ers in order to serve as an intermediary layer; the publishers act in
an advertiser role on obscure ad exchanges in order to capture the
trafﬁc generated from the bots. For 7cy, they ﬁnd trafﬁc directly
delivered to the publishers, with the bots mimicking human brows-
ing behavior closely and acting upon C&C instructions to click on
ads. Pearce et al. examine the activities of the ZeroAccess bot-
net, and estimate that it plausibly induced losses of $100K per day
until Microsoft’s takedown operation in late 2013 [33]. Finally,
Stone-Gross et al. document the fraudulent activities in online ad
exchanges, as observed from the perspective of a participating ad
network [35].
Detection of fraudulent trafﬁc has received less attention in the
literature, primarily due to the lack of access to data from adver-
tising networks. Haddadi proposed a technique to ﬁght click fraud
using “bluff” ads—ads having content that a normal human user is
highly unlikely to click, but click-bots would click since they do not
base clicking on comprehensibility of the content [27]. Based on
this idea, Dave et al. developed a technique to estimate the fraction
of click spam from the perspective of an advertiser, independently
from the estimates of the ad network [24]. They signed up as an ad-
vertiser on ten different networks and collected click data for their
ads (26M impressions over a period of 50 days). Analyzing this
data, they identiﬁed click spam delivered using malware, parked
domains, and arbitrage.
Lewis and Rao point out the difﬁculty of measuring the Re-
turn on Investment for advertising campaigns; the noisiness of the
efﬁcacy signals available to advertisers makes fraud hard to de-
tect [29].
Click fraud is but one web-based fraud phenomenon that has
surged in recent years. Careful measurements have played a large
part in furthering our understanding of different types of fraud and
abuse. Kanich et al., for example, study the returns from several
large spam campaigns [28]. Grier et al. characterize the spam
found on Twitter [26]. Christin details activity found on a large
underground market for illicit goods [23]. McCoy et al. study the
afﬁliate programs that are commonly used in selling medications
online [30]. These measurement studies reveal phenomena that are
more complex than they ﬁrst appear and inform efforts to combat
the fraud.
23. BACKGROUND
We surveyed the landscape of trafﬁc exchanges by performing
online web searches. We compiled a list of 50 such exchanges, and
manually investigated them to understand the features they offer.
In our analysis, we observed two categories of trafﬁc exchanges:
(i) generic, and (ii) social media promotion, where generic refers
to an exchange which offers trafﬁc exchange service for any web-
site, whereas social media promotion refers to an exchange de-
signed speciﬁcally for increasing views, likes, comments, and/or
subscribers/friends/followers on social platforms such as Twitter,
Facebook and YouTube. The latter category often requires mem-
bers to use their social network accounts for participation in the
exchange.
In this paper, we focus on generic exchanges as the destinations
to which the participants direct free trafﬁc. Determining their rea-
sons for doing so presents interesting puzzles.
We further classify the generic exchanges into the following cat-
egories based on the quality of trafﬁc they offer:
(i) Manual: Manual surf exchanges require an exchange mem-
ber to solve a CAPTCHA for each website view. This check allows
the exchange to claim that it offers human surfers for website views.
(ii) Basic Autosurf: Basic autosurf exchanges provide the mem-
bers a surf link that they can open in a browser for autosurf.
Javascript on this page automatically fetches the next site to be
viewed periodically and opens it inside an iframe within the surf
page.
(iii) Advanced Autosurf: Advanced autosurf exchanges provide
the members a tool/plugin, that they can download and run on their
machines.
In addition to automatically fetching and loading the
next page to be viewed, this tool can generate webpage view re-
quests with custom Referer and User-Agent.
We look at a sample of nine exchanges in this paper, which we
chose according to their popularity in Google search results, the
Internet marketing underground forum Black Hat World [5], and
various trafﬁc exchange ranking lists. We picked two manual ex-
changes: EasyHits4U [10] and HitSafari [15]; two basic autosurf
exchanges: 247AutoHits [2] and 10Khits [1]; and four advanced
autosurf exchanges: HitLeap [14], eBesucher [11], Jingling [16],
Otohits [20]. We also look at one of the social media promotion
exchanges, EnhanceViews Autowatcher [12], for the purpose of
comparing view trafﬁc characteristics.
4. EXCHANGE CHARACTERISTICS
In this section we provide an overview of the characteristics of
the exchanges, such as account pricing and the conﬁguration op-
tions that each exchange provides for the trafﬁc it delivers. Table 1
summarizes the characteristics of the exchanges we studied. We
discuss these in detail below.
4.1 Earning and using trafﬁc exchange cred-
its
All exchanges, with the exception of Jingling, require a user to
sign up for an account on their website. The sign-up process is sim-
ple, requiring only a valid email address. Some of the exchanges
offer premium memberships, which cost extra, but provide a better
exchange ratio (of sent to received views), monthly bonus points,
or enhanced functionality (see Table 1). The exchanges provide a
link or tool to the registered members, which they can view/run on
their machine(s) to earn exchange credits. The autosurf link/tool
communicates with the exchange Command & Control server pe-
riodically to get the list of URLs to view, whereas the manual ex-
changes require the user to solve a CAPTCHA for each URL fetch
from the server. The following are some of the features that differ-
entiate exchanges and membership levels.
• Account-to-Machine Ratio: The manual surf exchanges en-
force that one account be used only from one IP address at a
time. On the other hand, all the autosurf exchanges we stud-
ied allow an account to be used from multiple IP addresses
simultaneously.
• Exchange Ratio: For free accounts, most exchanges offer
an exchange ratio of less than 1 (often in the range 0.5–0.7).
This means that free members do not receive the same num-
ber of visits to their own websites as the number of web-
sites they view. Instead, the exchange takes a cut, thereby
enabling it to sell views directly for money. One autosurf
exchange offers a ratio greater than 1 for premium levels of
membership. The high premium membership cost at this ex-
change presumably allows the exchange to generate the extra
clicks for premium members using its own infrastructure if
the order cannot be fulﬁlled using the exchange members.
• Credits/Cash-Out: All the exchanges we investigated of-
fer trafﬁc exchange credits as a reward for surﬁng/running
their autosurf tool. Only EasyHits4U and eBesucher of-
fer a conversion of the credits to cash pay-out (via Paypal).
EasyHits4U pays $0.30 per 1,000 website views, and has a
minimum cash-out of $3. eBesucher pays $0.02 per 1,000
views, and has a minimum cash-out of ≈$3 as well. To the
best of our knowledge, cashing out on eBesucher involves
an identity check, requiring a scanned copy of a valid photo
identity document. This means that anyone who wishes to
remain anonymous must ﬁnd an indirect path to monetize
their credits. We did not try to cash-out from EasyHits4U,
since that would have required signiﬁcant effort (solving 10K
CAPTCHAs).
4.2 Controls offered for views
The exchanges offer a range of capabilities to make the trafﬁc
resemble that of an organic user population. Some of these are of-
fered only to premium members, which comes at a monthly mem-
bership price of 3–7AC, depending on the exchange and the service
level (see Table 1).
• Website Slots: Website slots are the number of URLs that
a member can have simultaneously active for viewing in the
exchange (the URLs can be pages of the same website or
different websites). The number of slots vary with member-
ship level on most exchanges, with a free account offering
between 3–15 slots depending on the exchange, and paid ac-
counts offering a higher number of slots—unlimited in some
cases. Some exchanges offer the same number of slots re-
gardless of membership level. For example, Jingling offers
400 slots, and Otohits and EnhanceViews Autowatcher offer
unlimited slots for all tiers.
An exchange user who wishes to direct trafﬁc at a small num-
ber of URLs might manage with few slots; however, a user
who wishes to generate views to a large number of URLs (for
example, different videos on a YouTube channel) might need
more than what the free tiers offer.
• Views Timing: This refers to how long a website will be
viewed for, which can affect whether the view is credited
for view count and payment purposes on the target website.
Manual and basic autosurf exchanges offer fairly short views
