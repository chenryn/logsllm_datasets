**Mounting an ISO Image with Daemon Tools on Windows XP**

I am using Daemon Tools to mount an ISO image on a Windows XP machine. The command I use is:
```shell
daemon.exe -mount 0,iso_path
```
This command mounts the ISO image to a device number. In my case, I have four partitions (C, D, E, F) and G for the DVD/CD-RW drive. When I mount the ISO, it gets assigned to the next available drive letter, which in this case is 'H:', with the name 'testmount' (as defined when creating the ISO).

### Queries

1. **How can I get the mount name (i.e., 'testmount') of the mounted ISO image?**
   - If there are already some mount points existing on the machine and I create a new one using Daemon Tools, how can I identify the latest mount point using a script?

2. **How can I get the drive letter where the ISO was mounted?**
   - Is there a Python script or a command (even a Windows command) that can provide this information?

### Possible Solutions

The `daemon.exe` tool has some command-line parameters, such as `-get_count` and `-get_letter`, but these do not work in the latest version (DLite). Instead, you can use the following commands:

- **`mountvol`**: Lists all mounted drives.
- **`dir`**: You can parse the output to get the volume label.

To determine the new drive letter and volume label, follow these steps:

1. Run `mountvol` before mounting the ISO to list the current mounted drives.
2. Mount the ISO using `daemon.exe`.
3. Run `mountvol` again to list the updated mounted drives.
4. Compare the two lists to identify the new drive letter.
5. Use `dir` to get the volume label of the new drive.

You can execute these commands using the `os.system()` call in Python. Here is an example script to achieve this:

```python
import os
import subprocess

# Step 1: Get the initial list of mounted drives
initial_mounts = subprocess.check_output(['mountvol']).decode('utf-8')

# Step 2: Mount the ISO using Daemon Tools
os.system('daemon.exe -mount 0,iso_path')

# Step 3: Get the updated list of mounted drives
updated_mounts = subprocess.check_output(['mountvol']).decode('utf-8')

# Step 4: Identify the new drive letter
new_drive = None
for line in updated_mounts.splitlines():
    if line not in initial_mounts:
        new_drive = line.split()[0]
        break

if new_drive:
    print(f"ISO mounted to: {new_drive}")

    # Step 5: Get the volume label of the new drive
    dir_output = subprocess.check_output(['dir', new_drive]).decode('utf-8')
    for line in dir_output.splitlines():
        if 'Volume in drive' in line:
            volume_label = line.split()[-1].strip()
            print(f"Volume label: {volume_label}")
else:
    print("Failed to detect the new drive letter.")
```

This script will help you identify the new drive letter and the volume label of the mounted ISO image.
