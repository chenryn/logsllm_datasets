User: I am using Daemon tool to mount an ISO image on Windows XP machine.I do mount using Daemon command (daemon.exe -mount 0,iso_path).
Above command will mount ISO image to device number. In my case I have 4 partition (C,D,E,F) and G for DVD/CD-RW. Now what happen, ISO gets mounted to drive letter 'H:' with name (as defined while creating ISO) say 'testmount'. 
My queries:-
1) How can I get mount name of mounted ISO image (i.e. 'testmount'). 
 Just another case; if there are already some mount points existing on machine and I created a new one using Daemon tool. Then If I can get latest one using script that will be great.
2) How to get drive letter where it did get mounted.
If anyone know python script or command (or even Win command ) to get these info. do let  me know.
Thanks...
Assistant: The daemon tools exe itself has some command line parameters :
-get_count and -get_letter
But for me these do not work in the latest version (DLite).
Instead you can use the commands :
mountvol - lists all the mounted drives
dir - you can parse the output to get the volume label
What you should do is run mountvol before daemon, and after, so you can detect the new drive letter. After that use "dir" to get the volume label.
I believe you can run these commands using the os.system() call in python
