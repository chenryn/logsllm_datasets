User:  Is there a problem in the following log? If so, give the corresponding solution 20171223-22:15:29:645|Step_ExtSDM|30002312|calculateCaloriesWithCache totalCalories=126775
Assistant: Whether there is an exception: no exception Description: The log information is a normal application log. It can be seen from the log information that when the application calculates the calorie value related to the number of steps of the day, it calls the "Step_ExtSDM" function and outputs the calculation result in the form of a string. The calculation result is the calorie value corresponding to the number of steps in the current day. Therefore, the log information does not contain any abnormal information.
