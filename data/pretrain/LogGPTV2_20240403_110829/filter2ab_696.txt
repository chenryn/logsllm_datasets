title:botconf2016 Challenges for a cross-jurisdictional botnet takedown
Practical case: how legislation can improve Law Enforcement effectiveness in pursuing criminals acting in an international environment.What to do when criminals act as if they were multinational enterprises, delocalizing their criminal services across multiple jurisdictions? When Internet is borderless and laws are bound to territories, successfully disrupting a botnet with domains and infrastructure scattered across multiple jurisdictions takes more than good will. In the case presented, Law Enforcement coordination with different judicial authorities and the private sector highlights the need for discussing further the legal challenges posed by carrying out cross-border investigative actions with the aim of disrupting criminal ecosystems and striving for crime attribution across multiple legislations.
