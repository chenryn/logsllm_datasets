User: When a container encounters a failure, will Kubernetes automatically restart it? If not, how to set up automatic restart?
Assistant: Yes, Kubernetes automatically restarts containers. However, the exact method of automatic restart depends on the failure policy of the container. In Kubernetes, there are three failure strategies for containers: 1. `RestartAlways`: No matter what causes the container to exit, Kubernetes will automatically restart it. 2. `RestartOnFailure`: Kubernetes will automatically restart only if the exit code of the container is non-zero. If the container exits normally, such as after executing the tasks it was going to do, Kubernetes will not automatically restart it. 3. `NeverRestart`: Kubernetes will never automatically restart this container. By default, Kubernetes uses the `RestartAlways` policy. If you want to set other policies, you can add `spec.template.spec.restartPolicy` field in the Pod definition file. For example, the following Pod definition file specifies the `RestartOnFailure` policy to automatically restart the container if the container exit code is non-zero: ``` apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: my-pod spec: restartPolicy: OnFailure containers: - name : my-container image: my-image command: ["my-command"] ```
