2) intra-CDN loop, which loops around multiple nodes of one
CDN provider; 3) inter-CDN loop, which loops across multiple
CDNs; and 4) CDN Dam Flooding, which couples forwarding-
loop attacks with timely controlled HTTP responses to signif-
icantly increase damage.
We gathered a list of popular CDNs1 and signed up with
those (or their resellers) that provide free or free-trial accounts

issued with the CDN’s subdomain and the form of forwarding
destination is IP address. In all other cases we could test, the
feasibility of forwarding loops is not affected.
Modiﬁcation of other header ﬁelds. CDNs also vary
regarding changing other header ﬁelds when forwarding a
request. Such behaviors, summarized in Table III, affect the
efﬁcacy of forwarding loops.
We ﬁrst ﬁnd that 9 CDNs depend on standard or self-
deﬁned headers to detect forwarding loops. We measured these
results by connecting our origin server and, separately, each
commercial CDN node in a loop. If requests in the loop always
stop in a short time unless we remove a certain header or set
the value of certain header on our origin server, then we deduce
that the CDN uses the header for loop detection. We ﬁnd that
Akamai and Tencent add Akamai-Origin-Hop and X-Daa-
Tunnel headers with integer values that count forwarded hops.
These appear to restrict forwarding to maximum values of 12
and 6, respectively. Alibaba, CloudFront and Level3 append
standard Via headers with the server’s hostname. They also
check for the presence of certain strings within any existing
Via header to detect loops. Fastly also appends a self-deﬁned
header Fastly-FF with its hostname, and rejects a request if
its hostname already appears in the header value. Incapsula
adds a new header, Incapsula-Proxy-ID, with the ID set to
its internal identiﬁer, basing loop detection on the presence
of this header. Baidu and CloudFlare servers append their IP
addresses to the X-Forwarded-For header, and also add the
self-deﬁned header CF-Connecting-IP (Baidu conﬁrmed that
they have a partnership with CloudFlare, which CloudFlare
later announced). Baidu and CloudFlare servers reject a request
if its IP address already appears in the X-Forwarded-For

header, or given the presence of a CF-Connecting-IP header.
We also ﬁnd that all CDNs except KeyCDN, MaxCDN,
and Tencent increase the header size whenever forwarding a
request, usually by adding or appending header ﬁelds like Via
or X-Forwarded-For, although not necessarily using these
ﬁelds for loop detection. This behavior causes forwarding
loops to eventually stop, because all CDNs implement bounds
on the header size of acceptable requests. If in each round of a
forwarding loop, the header size of the request increases, then
the loop will break when the header size exceeds the bound
at any node. Table IV summarizes the header size limitations
of different CDNs.
Several CDNs reset
the value of certain header ﬁelds
instead of appending on them. CDN77, CDN.net, CDNlion
and CDNSun reset the Via header, and KeyCDN resets the X-

Forwarded-For header to its own IP address. As we shall see,
these behaviors cause undesirable interactions that increase the
efﬁcacy of forwarding-loop attacks.
Fastly and MaxCDN support WAFs that allow customer-
deﬁned rules to remove HTTP headers in requests [5] [14].
According to our measurements, Fastly prevents removal of
the headers added by its own servers, while MaxCDN does
not appear to impose any such limitation.
Handling timeouts. After forwarding a request
to its
destination, a CDN node waits for a response until a timeout
occurs. Table V shows the timeout periods we measured,
ranging from 60 seconds to 900 seconds.

When a timeout occurs at a node in a forwarding loop,
the node closes the corresponding connection to its successor.
This closing action triggers a client-side connection close
event at its successor node. If the successor node reacts by
abort forwarding, i.e., closing the corresponding forwarding
