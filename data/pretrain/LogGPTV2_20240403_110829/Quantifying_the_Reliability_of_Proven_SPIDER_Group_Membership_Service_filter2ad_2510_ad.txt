• Symmetric (Table 4)
Overall reliability is better here than for the 100% asym-
metric fault experiments. The ‘All Permanent’ policy has a
low-end loaded distribution, with over 50% of the design
points at a level of 10-3 assumption violations per hour or
greater. The ‘All Transient’ policy has the majority of its
design points in the 10-3 through 10-9 range (20.8%, 27.8%,
and 22.9%). The ‘Perfect’ policy has a slightly greater per-
centage of design points in the highest reliability level than
the ‘All Transient’ policy. All three policies have design
points in the highest and the lowest reliability levels, sug-
gesting that apt parameter choice is important.
• Benign (Table 5)
Benign faults are the least harmful of the three fault
types. However, even for benign faults, the ‘All Perma-
nent’ policy has over 50% of the design points at a level of
10-3 assumption violations per hour or greater. The ‘All
Transient’ and ‘All Permanent’ policies have the same dis-
tribution, since convicting benign faulty nodes has no bene-
fit. These two policies have the majority of design points at
10-11 assumption violations per hour or better.
7. Related Work
Other researchers underscore the need to critically ex-
amine how the assumptions of a formally proven system
will withstand expected fault conditions. Powell intro-
duces the concept of assumption coverage, showing the
need to balance the risk of uncovered faults versus the risk
of increased failure rate due to adding redundant compo-
nents [13]. Powell defines assumption coverage as “The
failure mode assumption coverage (px) is defined as the
probability that the assertion X defining the assumed be-
havior of a component proves to be true in practice condi-
tioned on the fact that the component has failed: px = Pr{X
= true|component failed}.” [13]. In other words, assump-
tion coverage is a measure of how well actual system faults
map to the fault types defined in the assumptions of the
fault tolerance mechanisms. Faults that do not map are not
‘covered’, and the system may fail. Powell illustrates the
paradox that weakening assumptions may lower reliability
[13]. Weaker assumptions typically require more redun-
dancy, which increases fault rates proportional to the num-
ber of components. Cukier and Powell discuss how to use
testing data to estimate the assumption coverage in [6].
Bauer, Kopetz, and Puschner note that a measure of how
the system withstands multiple faults is needed, even if one
implements the weakest assumptions available [2]. In their
study of the assumption coverage of the Time Triggered Ar-
chitecture, they observe that “In general, every fault-toler-
ant system relies on the existence of a minimum number of
correct components. Thus, even an optimal system archi-
tecture, which has 100% assumption coverage with respect
to the tolerated failure modes, can never have 100% as-
sumption coverage with respect to coincident faults.” [2].
Our notion of assumption reliability is a natural comple-
ment to assumption coverage, as assumption reliability is
the ability of the system to withstand faults with perfect as-
sumption coverage (as defined by [13]). We also show that
the choice of system parameters may greatly affect assump-
tion reliability, which is correlated with system reliability.
As motivation for measuring assumption reliability, re-
cent work reports on observed asymmetric/Byzantine
faults. Driscoll, Hall, Sivencrona, and Zumsteg report on
phenomena that cause Byzantine faults, noting that the
probability of Byzantine faults in distributed systems inher-
ently cannot be zero (for example, clocks can never be per-

fectly synchronized) [8]. They argue that for safety-critical
systems, reducing this probability to an unknown level is
inadequate [8]. Ademaj, Sivencrona, Bauer, and Torin give
results from fault injection experiments designed to esti-
mate the percentage of certain Byzantine faults (Slightly
Off Specification faults and general asymmetric faults) in
the Time Triggered Architecture [1]. They produced
Byzantine faults in a bus topology (providing some data
about the Byzantine fault rate), but did not observe any in a
star topology which employs additional fault protection.
Assumption reliability could be used to investigate various
Byzantine fault percentages, using limited available data
instead of requiring a high-precision fault rate figure.
8. Conclusions
Measuring the reliability of a proof’s assumptions is a
valuable exercise. We modeled the probability that the as-
sumptions of the SPIDER group membership service
would be violated for 12,600 possible configurations.
In
particular, we focused on the impact of transient faults on
the system, and examined assumption reliability with re-
spect to three fault types (asymmetric, symmetric, and be-
nign). Analysis at the design stage allows policy trade-offs
and predicts how the system will withstand fault occur-
rences over a wide range of system parameters.
We have presented three examples, using the SPIDER
group membership conviction policy as a case study. First,
we determined the expected Maximum Fault Assumption
violations per hour for 3,024 configurations in the range of
expected operational parameters. This varied from fewer
than 10-11 to more than 10-3 assumption violations/hour,
where if the Maximum Fault Assumption is violated, the
guarantees may not hold and the service may fail. This in-
dicates that even with the same formal proof foundation,
actual service reliability may differ greatly. Next, we
looked at the trade-off point between two conviction poli-
cies for 10,800 configurations, one policy treating all faults
as permanent, the other as all transient. The reliability esti-
mates matched the calculated trade-off point. Also, this
analysis showed that the all-transient policy is expected to
be more reliable than the all-permanent policy for aero-
space/aviation Bit Error Rate ranges. Finally, we tested as-
sumption reliability with respect to three fault types -
asymmetric, symmetric, and benign - for 3,024 configura-
tions. Assumption reliability subject to asymmetric faults
was quite different from the symmetric and benign cases.
This work demonstrates that the assumptions of a for-
mally proven service may be reliable for some system con-
figurations, but not others. In order to claim that a service is
reliable, the service’s assumptions must also be shown to be
reliable. Future work will measure assumption reliability
for other safety-critical protocols, including the Time Trig-
gered Protocol, Class C (TTP/C) and the FlexRay protocol.
