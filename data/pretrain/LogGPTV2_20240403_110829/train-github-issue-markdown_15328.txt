# Environment
    Windows build number: Win32NT 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.5.2762.0
# Steps to reproduce
    echo -e '\e[4m underlined \e[33m yellow \e[39m should still be underlined \e[m'
# Expected behavior
The entire line should be underlined.
# Actual behavior
The "should still be underlined" bits aren't underlined.
Note that SGR codes `22`, `27`, `39` and `49` seem to cause this effect, but
only if they're predeced by a `1`, `7`, `30-37` or `40-47`, resp., that is,
only if they do actually turn off some other attribute.
Also note that if the "should still be underlined" text is made longer so that
it overflows to the next line (or even multiple new lines), it's underlined in
the last one of these lines. This makes it perhaps a reincarnation of #47.
Furthermore, changing the window width and thus causing a reflow of the text
removes the underlining from the last line.
