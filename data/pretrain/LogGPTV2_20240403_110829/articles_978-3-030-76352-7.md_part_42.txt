Abstract. While there has been considerable industry interest in the
deployment and uptake of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technol-
ogy, very little has been done by way of generating technological fore-
sight into the manner in which RPA systems might evolve in the short-
to medium-term. This paper seeks to fill that gap.
1 Introduction
Theideathatbusinessprocessexecutioncanbeautomatedviathedeploymentof
roboticcomponentsorbots,leadingtothenotionofRoboticProcessAutomation
(or RPA) [1,13,27], has gained significant traction in industry. This technology
trendstartedwithcost-savingasthedrivingvalueproposition(e.g.,automating
many of the human-mediated tasks often outsourced to call centres could lead
tosignficantcostreductions).Thereis,however,agrowingrealisationthatRPA
can deliver a significant improvement in the quality of enterprise functionality.
A key trend is the shift in emphasis from process automation to enterprise
automation. In the current thinking (and product offerings) around RPA, the
unit of analysis is the business process. We argue that agent technology affords
theopportunitytoautomateallaspectsofenterprisefunctionality(traditionally
conceivedasacollectionofdisparatebusinessprocesses)withinasingleunifying
conceptual (and programming) framework. In the most general sense, an enter-
prise can be viewed as a collection of agents. This does not imply that we must
vieweverydistinctenterpriseactor(people,roles,machines)asadistinctagent.
Instead, we create distinct agents to accommodate situations where the separa-
tion of knowledge or capabilities (driven by business competition constraints, or
compliance requirements) needs to be maintained. In the rest of this paper, we
will base our arguments mainly around the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent
architecture[21]whichisarguablythemostexpressiveandmostcomprehensive
conception of agent design and implementation [20] on offer in the literature.
Muchofthediscoursearoundbusinessprocessmanagement (BPM) assumes
a clear distinction between the coordination machinery (the process engine,
driven by a coordination model) and the machinery that actually executes the
required functionality. We have come to a point where we have to acknowledge

2 Related Work
AgenttechnologyhasbeenusedinRPAinavarietyofsettings.Thefollowingis
a brief survey of existing work in using agents or bots in RPA implementations
in various contexts. Agents have been used in RPA to enable automation in
multiple industries and enterprise functions including Telecommunication [18],
Human Resources (HR) & Recruitment [6,8], and Banking [11]. Rule-based and
monotonous tasks of a business process can be automated with the help of rule-
based agents whereas agents utilizing AI algorithms can be used to automate
more complex business processes involving decision-making [23]. Agents in RPA
combine AI technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, image and
natural language processing with internet of things (IoT) and block chain tech-
nologies to perform automation tasks. [16] represents an orchestration of agents
with different functionalities into a single bot to automate a business function.
Autonomous agents have been used in an innovative approach to debt col-
lection [28]. This approach uses optical character recognition (OCR) to iden-
tify the main objects from a document and employs deep learning methods,
such as temporal convolutional networks and convolutional neural networks to
enhance the quality. Lin et al. [14] demonstrates RPA agents in semiconduc-
tor smart manufacturing without the help of an RPA vendor, where an OCR
technique is implemented for reading handwritten or printed text and an arti-
ficial neural network (ANN) is implemented for identifying the fuzzy or clear
pictures. Kobayashi et al. [9] illustrates requirements for utilizing RPA agents
in consumer services, especially using robots to assist elderly people by com-
municating with their families and placing grocery orders for them. Desirable
technologies for implementation with RPA agents include the internet of things
(IoT), artificial intelligence (especially the Watson Natural Language Classifier
for learning communication), the Google Cloud Platform for voice recognition,
and the NeoFace Cloud for facial recognition. Zhang et al. [30] has provided
an RPA implementation framework for audit engagements which involves audit
workflowanalysis,audittasksareautomatedusingeitherRPAagentsorcombi-
nationofRPAagentsandAIorcognitivecomputingbasedonthecomplexityof
the audit task (structured, semi-structured or unstructured respectively). Rizk
etal. [22]explores interactive automation intheform ofaconversational digital
assistant. It allows the business users to interact with customers and customize
The Future of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) 275
their automation solutions through natural language. The framework, responsi-
ble for creating such assistants, relies on a multi-agent orchestration model and
conversational wrappers to create autonomous agents including RPA agents.
These agents are equipped with skills that help them understand and generate
natural language alongside task automation. The orchestrator expects agents
to adhere to a specific contract to determine which agents respond to a user’s
utterance.
Little research has been conducted to improve RPA technology using Belief-
Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. Mahala [15] explores using BDI agents as a
promising alternative to the current approaches in the implementation and
designofcomplicatedsoftwaresystemsandusesBDIagentarchitecturetoimple-
ment BDI agents in RPA. BDI agents can handle multiple competing agendas
which is not possible in process-oriented approaches. BDI agents provide addi-
tionalflexibilitybyusinganoptionselectionfunctionandallowing highpriority
events to interrupt lower priority goals.
3 Agent-Based Process Execution
It is useful to compare and contrast agent-based process execution with current
approaches to process execution based on BPM technology.
3.1 Where BPM Outperforms Agent-Based Execution
– Process models are easier to understand than agent models
– Diagrammatic executable specification languages are in widespread use (e.g.,
BPMN)
– BPM technology in general enjoys widespread use and adoption
– There is a vast amount of associated tooling on offer
– Mature technology for data-driven extraction of process models is available
and in widespread use (process mining)
3.2 Where Agent-Based Execution Outperforms BPM Technology
– BDI agent plans have pre-conditions
– In some extensions, they also have post-conditions
– There are sophisticated mechanisms for hierarchic structuring of workflows
(via sub-goals)
– Sophisticated mechanisms exist for the interruption, re-consideration and re-
deliberation of agent plans (again, leveraging sub-goals)
– Sophisticated event listeners and event management exist (e.g., the event set
and the event selection function)
– Sophisticated XOR-gateways, which might leverage run-time non-functional
assessments are on offer (via the option selection function)
– Sophisticatedpre-emptiveschedulingmechanismsexist(e.g.,intentionstacks
and intention selection)

4 The Evolution of Enterprise Functionality
4.1 Personalization
Personalizationhasreceivedconsiderableattentionintherecentpast.Theques-
tionofbusinessprocesspersonalizationhasbeenconsideredintheliterature[29]
(although tool support is not in widespread use in industry). The adoption of
RPA makes the prospect of extreme personalization or enterprise-wide person-
alization - where all business processes personalize to cater to the individual’s
unique characteristics or needs every time an external client (or internal user)
engageswiththeenterprise-feasible.Forinstance,thesimpleactofanemployee
engaging with the corporate leave booking process can lead to multiple down-
stream consequences. It can trigger a process to search for temporary replace-
ment from the internal pool of employees, or a process to externally recruit a
temporaryreplacement(whichprocessisactuallyexecutedmightbedetermined
by the preferences of the employee seeking leave). Also, in a manner driven by
employeepreferences,aleavenotificationemailmightbesenttoasetofinternal
or external stakeholders, a temporary hold might be placed on the employee’s
corporate gym and childcare centre membership, and a similar temporary hold
might be placed on room cleaning services for the employee’s office. Depending
on the employee’s preferences, a request for a travel quote might be generated
from the firm’s corporate travel agency and an alert might be generated for the
firm’s internal security service seeking additional patrolling of the employee’s
office area for the duration of the leave. In terms of RPA implementation, the
personalizationexercisewouldbedrivenbyamulti-dimensionalcharacterization
oftheindividual(whichmightbeexplicitlycodedorlearntoveraseriesofinter-
actions). An agent planning approach, where the variations in the preconditions
satisfiedmightleadtoawidevarietyofplansorsub-plansinvoked,wouldbefar
more amenable to achieving these behaviour variations than a more traditional
approach based on existing BPM technology.
4.2 Variation
While personalization is one significant driver for process variability [2], a range
of other factors require the generation, selection and enactment of business pro-
cess variants. These include the local needs of various industry segments, local
compliance requirements and so on. An insurance claim handling process, for
instance, must vary according to the legislative and regulatory frameworks that
applyinvariousjurisdictionsandaccordingtothespecificlineofbusiness,while
adhering, where possible, to the intent of an enterprise-wide reference process
The Future of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) 277
model [19]. An agent planning approach that would be feasible in an RPA con-
text would enable us to support a very large space of process variants, for very
similar reasons to those listed above.
4.3 Adaptation
The notion of business process adaptation generalizes many of the questions
aroundprocesspersonalizationandvariationmanagement[7].Specifically,adap-
tationofenterprisefunctionalityinvolvesrespondingtochangesintheoperating
context, ideally in real-time. Reactivity is difficult to achieve in a BPM context,
butisoftenanaturalconsequenceoftheadoptionofagenttechnology(specially,
BDI agent systems). BDI agent systems provide for event listeners which feed
into an event set. The event set can be viewed as a FIFO queue, or can be pro-
vided as input to an event selection function which can support sophisticated
machinery for identifying the event most deserving of immediate attention. A
combinationofeventlistenersandevent-driven,context-sensitiveagentplanning
willenablefutureRPAsystemstoachieveenterprisefunctionalityadaptationon
a scale and at a level of ubiquity not achievable with current BPM technology.
4.4 Distribution
Distributedbusinessprocessexecutionhasreceivedlimitedattentionintheliter-
ature[4],butrepresentsanimportant challenge. FutureRPAsystemswill likely
still require a mix of human and machine functionality. In general, the locus of
execution of these functionalities might be different (even for fully automated
processes). Distributed process execution may be necessary for a variety of rea-
sons. The knowledge required for process execution might be distributed and
not easily shared on account of business competition or compliance constraints.
