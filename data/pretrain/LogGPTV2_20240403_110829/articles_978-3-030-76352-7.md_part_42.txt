#### Abstract
While there has been considerable industry interest in the deployment and uptake of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology, very little has been done to generate technological foresight into how RPA systems might evolve in the short to medium term. This paper aims to fill that gap.

#### 1. Introduction
The idea that business process execution can be automated through the deployment of robotic components or bots, leading to Robotic Process Automation (RPA), has gained significant traction in industry. Initially driven by cost-saving, RPA is now recognized for its potential to improve the quality of enterprise functionality. A key trend is the shift from process automation to enterprise automation. In current RPA thinking and product offerings, the unit of analysis is the business process. We argue that agent technology offers the opportunity to automate all aspects of enterprise functionality within a single unifying conceptual and programming framework. In the most general sense, an enterprise can be viewed as a collection of agents. This does not imply that every distinct enterprise actor (people, roles, machines) must be seen as a distinct agent. Instead, we create distinct agents to accommodate situations where the separation of knowledge or capabilities (driven by business competition constraints or compliance requirements) needs to be maintained. In the rest of this paper, we will base our arguments mainly around the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent architecture, which is arguably the most expressive and comprehensive conception of agent design and implementation available in the literature.

Much of the discourse around business process management (BPM) assumes a clear distinction between the coordination machinery (the process engine, driven by a coordination model) and the machinery that actually executes the required functionality. We have reached a point where we must acknowledge the need for ubiquitous, hierarchical coordination. In other words, what is an activity or task at a given level of abstraction is, in fact, a complex sub-process requiring its own coordination model at a lower level of abstraction. Similarly, an action in an abstract BDI agent plan is a goal requiring its own set of plans at a lower level of abstraction. This sets the stage for a compare-and-contrast exercise between the coordination capabilities of BDI agents and those of current business process engines.

In the following, when we refer to RPA, we mean the RPA technology of the future, built around sophisticated agent technology such as BDI agent systems.

#### 2. Related Work
Agent technology has been used in RPA in various settings. This section provides a brief survey of existing work in using agents or bots in RPA implementations across different contexts. Agents have been used in RPA to enable automation in multiple industries and enterprise functions, including Telecommunication [18], Human Resources (HR) & Recruitment [6, 8], and Banking [11]. Rule-based and monotonous tasks of a business process can be automated with the help of rule-based agents, while agents utilizing AI algorithms can automate more complex business processes involving decision-making [23]. Agents in RPA combine AI technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, image and natural language processing, IoT, and blockchain to perform automation tasks. [16] represents an orchestration of agents with different functionalities into a single bot to automate a business function.

Autonomous agents have been used in an innovative approach to debt collection [28]. This approach uses optical character recognition (OCR) to identify the main objects from a document and employs deep learning methods, such as temporal convolutional networks and convolutional neural networks, to enhance the quality. Lin et al. [14] demonstrate RPA agents in semiconductor smart manufacturing without the help of an RPA vendor, where an OCR technique is implemented for reading handwritten or printed text, and an artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented for identifying fuzzy or clear pictures. Kobayashi et al. [9] illustrate requirements for utilizing RPA agents in consumer services, especially using robots to assist elderly people by communicating with their families and placing grocery orders for them. Desirable technologies for implementation with RPA agents include IoT, artificial intelligence (especially the Watson Natural Language Classifier for learning communication), the Google Cloud Platform for voice recognition, and the NeoFace Cloud for facial recognition. Zhang et al. [30] provide an RPA implementation framework for audit engagements, which involves audit workflow analysis and automating audit tasks using either RPA agents or a combination of RPA agents and AI or cognitive computing based on the complexity of the audit task (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, respectively). Rizk et al. [22] explore interactive automation in the form of a conversational digital assistant, allowing business users to interact with customers and customize their automation solutions through natural language. The framework responsible for creating such assistants relies on a multi-agent orchestration model and conversational wrappers to create autonomous agents, including RPA agents. These agents are equipped with skills that help them understand and generate natural language alongside task automation. The orchestrator expects agents to adhere to a specific contract to determine which agents respond to a user’s utterance.

Little research has been conducted to improve RPA technology using Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. Mahala [15] explores using BDI agents as a promising alternative to current approaches in the implementation and design of complicated software systems and uses BDI agent architecture to implement BDI agents in RPA. BDI agents can handle multiple competing agendas, which is not possible in process-oriented approaches. BDI agents provide additional flexibility by using an option selection function and allowing high-priority events to interrupt lower-priority goals.

#### 3. Agent-Based Process Execution
It is useful to compare and contrast agent-based process execution with current approaches to process execution based on BPM technology.

##### 3.1 Where BPM Outperforms Agent-Based Execution
- **Process models are easier to understand than agent models.**
- **Diagrammatic executable specification languages are in widespread use (e.g., BPMN).**
- **BPM technology in general enjoys widespread use and adoption.**
- **There is a vast amount of associated tooling on offer.**
- **Mature technology for data-driven extraction of process models is available and in widespread use (process mining).**

##### 3.2 Where Agent-Based Execution Outperforms BPM Technology
- **BDI agent plans have pre-conditions.**
- **In some extensions, they also have post-conditions.**
- **There are sophisticated mechanisms for hierarchical structuring of workflows (via sub-goals).**
- **Sophisticated mechanisms exist for the interruption, re-consideration, and re-deliberation of agent plans (again, leveraging sub-goals).**
- **Sophisticated event listeners and event management exist (e.g., the event set and the event selection function).**
- **Sophisticated XOR-gateways, which might leverage run-time non-functional assessments, are on offer (via the option selection function).**
- **Sophisticated preemptive scheduling mechanisms exist (e.g., intention stacks and intention selection).**
- **Sophisticated agent communication languages exist.**
- **A large body of other AI results can be brought to bear (learning, uncertainty handling, knowledge representation and reasoning, optimization, game-tree search, etc.).**

#### 4. The Evolution of Enterprise Functionality

##### 4.1 Personalization
Personalization has received considerable attention in recent years. The question of business process personalization has been considered in the literature [29], although tool support is not yet widely used in industry. The adoption of RPA makes the prospect of extreme personalization or enterprise-wide personalization—where all business processes cater to the individual’s unique characteristics or needs every time an external client (or internal user) engages with the enterprise—feasible. For instance, the simple act of an employee engaging with the corporate leave booking process can trigger multiple downstream consequences. It can initiate a process to search for a temporary replacement from the internal pool of employees or to externally recruit a temporary replacement, depending on the preferences of the employee seeking leave. Also, in a manner driven by employee preferences, a leave notification email might be sent to a set of internal or external stakeholders, a temporary hold might be placed on the employee’s corporate gym and childcare center membership, and a similar temporary hold might be placed on room cleaning services for the employee’s office. Depending on the employee’s preferences, a request for a travel quote might be generated from the firm’s corporate travel agency, and an alert might be generated for the firm’s internal security service to seek additional patrolling of the employee’s office area during the leave. In terms of RPA implementation, the personalization exercise would be driven by a multi-dimensional characterization of the individual (which might be explicitly coded or learned over a series of interactions). An agent planning approach, where variations in the preconditions satisfied might lead to a wide variety of plans or sub-plans invoked, would be far more amenable to achieving these behavior variations than a more traditional approach based on existing BPM technology.

##### 4.2 Variation
While personalization is one significant driver for process variability [2], a range of other factors require the generation, selection, and enactment of business process variants. These include the local needs of various industry segments and local compliance requirements. For example, an insurance claim handling process must vary according to the legislative and regulatory frameworks that apply in various jurisdictions and according to the specific line of business, while adhering, where possible, to the intent of an enterprise-wide reference process model [19]. An agent planning approach feasible in an RPA context would enable us to support a very large space of process variants, for very similar reasons to those listed above.

##### 4.3 Adaptation
The notion of business process adaptation generalizes many of the questions around process personalization and variation management [7]. Specifically, adaptation of enterprise functionality involves responding to changes in the operating context, ideally in real-time. Reactivity is difficult to achieve in a BPM context but is often a natural consequence of adopting agent technology, especially BDI agent systems. BDI agent systems provide for event listeners which feed into an event set. The event set can be viewed as a FIFO queue or provided as input to an event selection function, which can support sophisticated machinery for identifying the event most deserving of immediate attention. A combination of event listeners and event-driven, context-sensitive agent planning will enable future RPA systems to achieve enterprise functionality adaptation on a scale and at a level of ubiquity not achievable with current BPM technology.

##### 4.4 Distribution
Distributed business process execution has received limited attention in the literature [4] but represents an important challenge. Future RPA systems will likely still require a mix of human and machine functionality. In general, the locus of execution of these functionalities might be different (even for fully automated processes). Distributed process execution may be necessary for a variety of reasons. The knowledge required for process execution might be distributed and not easily shared due to business competition or compliance constraints. Sometimes, connectivity or network latency issues might impede knowledge sharing and hence centralized process execution. Distributed process execution is not uncommon in the current context. A field service technician might execute some parts of an equipment maintenance or repair process on-site, while the automated components might be executed at the corporate headquarters. Future RPA systems will need to address these challenges to achieve seamless and efficient distributed execution.
