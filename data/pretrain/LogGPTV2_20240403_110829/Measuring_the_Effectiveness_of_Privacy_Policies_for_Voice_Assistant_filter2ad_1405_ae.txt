Question
Responses
Do you think all skills should have a privacy policy?
A privacy policy is always necessary to give users a piece of mind.
Users should be able to know the risks involved such as if others could
be listening in illegally.
Privacy policy is definitely required so it can assure consumers that it
is unlikely that malicious actions will occur with their data.
They should be made easily accessible too.
Required if in fact there are things that customers should be warned
about prior to using it.
A privacy policy would be completely necessary. I feel like the skills
need to disclose everything being done with a user’s data.
But it should be easily explained and controls easily learned.
If data is being collected, this is personal information that the user
should have some control over.
It needs to be more digestible so people will actually read it.
I do think it is necessary to have a privacy policy, but I do think it
should be short and easy to understand.

present a few selected responses received from the partici-
pants in our user study when asked the question "Do you
think all skills should have a privacy policy?"
