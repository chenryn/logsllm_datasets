On my macOS 10.6.8, there was an older version of Python installed at the following path:
```
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
```
I then downloaded and installed a newer version from the official Python website, which was placed in:
```
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
```

I am wondering which of these paths is the correct one for the new installation. Should I move the newly installed Python to the `/System` directory?

**Response:**

The files located in the `/System` directory are essential for the system's operation and should not be modified or replaced unless you have a specific and compelling reason to do so. The `/Library` directory, on the other hand, is the appropriate location for software that you install for your own use.

Therefore, the newer version of Python should remain in the `/Library` directory. There is no need to move it to the `/System` directory.
