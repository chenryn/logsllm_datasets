User: On my OSX 10.6.8 there was an old version of python installed and it was in:
System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
I downloaded and installed a newer version from the official website and it went to:
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
I was just wondering. Which one is the correct path? And 
Should I move this installation into /System/?
Assistant: Things that are in System are there for a reason: because they're used by the system. You should not change things in there unless you know what you're doing, and even then not unless you have a very good reason. Library is the right place for software you install for your own use.
