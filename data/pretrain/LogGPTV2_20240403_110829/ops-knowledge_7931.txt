User: Is there a quick way (i.e. that minimizes time-to-answer) to find out if a file is open on Linux?   
Let's say I have a process that writes a ton a files in a directory and another process which reads those files once they are finished writing, can the latter process know if a file is still being written to by the former process?
A Python based solution would be ideal, if possible.
Note: I understand I could be using a FIFO / Queue based solution but I am looking for something else.
Assistant: You can use fcntl module, afaik, it's has fcntl function that identical to C function, so something like fcntl(fd, F_GETFL) could be useful, but I'm not sure. Can you check is target file is blocked for writing by opening it in write mode?
