Abstract. Wireless local area networks (WLANs) can adopt channel
hopping technologies in order to avoid unintentional interferences such as
radars or microwaves, which function as proactive jamming signals. Even
though channel hopping technologies are eﬀective against proactive types
of jamming, it has been reported that reactive jammers could attack the
targets through scanning busy channels. In this paper, we demonstrate
that reactive jamming is only eﬀective against channel hopping Wi-Fi de-
vices in non-dense networks and that it is not eﬀective in dense networks.
Then, we propose a new jamming attack called “persistent jamming”,
which is a modiﬁed reactive jamming that is eﬀective in dense networks.
The proposed persistent jamming attack can track a device that switches
channels using the following two features, and it can attack the speciﬁc
target or a target group of devices. The ﬁrst feature is that the proposed
attack can use the partial association ID (PAID), which is included for
power saving in the IEEE 802.11ac/af/ah frame headers, to track and jam
the targets. The second feature is that it is possible to attack persistently
based on device ﬁngerprints in IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n legacy devices. Our
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed persistent jamming can
improve the attack eﬃciency by approximately 80% in dense networks
compared with the reactive jamming scheme, and it can also shut down
the communication link of the target nodes using 20 dBm of jamming
power and a 125 ms response time.

Introduction
Wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies are an essential feature of
everyday life because they are used in home networking, smart mobile devices,
network infrastructure, and much more. These applications require very high
throughput and long service coverage. In order to meet these demands of the
users, WLAN technologies have been evolving to use wider channel bandwidths
for IEEE 802.11n/ac [2, 4] in the 2.4/5 GHz industry science and medical (ISM)
band, and they support lower receiver sensitivity for a wider range of up to
approximately 1 km for IEEE 802.11af/ah in the TV white space or sub-1 GHz
frequencies [5, 6]. As more and more wireless devices are connected and wireless
access points (APs) are densely deployed in the scarce frequency spectrum and

in the limited region, the failure probability of packet transmissions is expected
to increase due to interference from other devices and jammers. Because the
2.4 GHz band is already congested and the 5 GHz band will be congested soon
[15], the wireless environment may suﬀer severe interference from unintentional
jammers and intentional jammers [9, 17].
Recent studies have demonstrated that various proactive jamming methods
such as constant, random, and deceptive jamming can be launched easily in wire-
less networks [10, 26]. Meanwhile, in order to manage jamming attacks, wireless
nodes can adopt a channel hopping scheme through which nodes can switch their
channel frequencies as required in order to improve the link quality [10, 28, 29].
If a certain channel is not available due to jamming signals, the wireless nodes
switch channels to another idle channel according to the channel hopping pro-
tocol; consequently, the wireless nodes can avoid proactive jamming attacks. In
the literature, several studies have proposed a smart jamming scheme called
“reactive jamming” for eﬃcient jamming attacks [10,26]. The reactive jammer,
which is the most popularly discussed method for disturbing channel hopping
nodes, investigates a busy channel in order to identify a channel-hopped node
and begins emitting a jamming signal as soon as it senses activity on that chan-
nel because the shared nature of the wireless medium allows adversaries to easily
monitor the communications between wireless devices. Therefore, even though
the target nodes have switched to another channel due to the jamming signal, the
jammer can switch to the target node’s new channel and attack again. However,
the reactive jamming schemes assume that attackers can locate a channel-hopped
target because the network is not dense [10, 26, 28, 29]. If there are multiple de-
vices using diﬀerent channels, the challenging question to the adversary is how
to determine which channel is being used by the target device.
Our contribution In this paper, we ﬁrst demonstrate that the existing jamming
attacks are not eﬀective against channel hopping devices in dense networks. Be-
cause there are multiple nodes in the channel in dense networks, a conventional
jammer cannot identify the target node’s channel among the multiple candidates
due to the lack of channel awareness and device information. In this situation, the
only way to disturb a speciﬁc node’s communication is to emit a jamming signal
to all busy channels and, consequently, the detection possibility of the jamming
attack increases and the jamming eﬃcacy decreases in terms of the attacker’s
cost and attacking damage. For this reason, a jamming attack in a dense network
is considered extremely diﬃcult. Despite the limitations, in order to stop this,
in this paper we propose a new jamming method called “persistent jamming”,
which is a novel attack in the form of modiﬁed reactive jamming. Moreover, we
demonstrate that identifying a channel hopping device and launching a jamming
attack in a dense network are feasible. Based on the observation that the partial
association identiﬁcation (PAID) and device ﬁngerprints can be used to identify
channel hopping devices in dense networks, the attacker can persistently track
and jam target devices. Our evaluation results demonstrate that persistent jam-
ming using the PAID and device ﬁngerprint detection can improve the attack
eﬃciency by approximately 80% in dense networks compared with the reactive
jamming scheme, and it can continuously degrade the throughput to close to

zero against channel hopping target devices in order that the communication
link is disconnected with a 20 dBm jamming power and 125 ms response time.
Our work provides the following three key contributions.
– This is the ﬁrst investigation of the limitations of the unprotected PHY
header that is identiﬁed using PAID and ﬁngerprints extracted from the
frame header in order to track a target device or a target group of devices,
and to examine the feasibility of persistent jamming.
– Persistent jamming is experimentally evaluated in a ﬁeld programmable gate
array (FPGA) prototype that was designed and veriﬁed for commercializa-
tion as an IEEE 802.11n/ac Wi-Fi chipset.
– The proposed attack is also implemented and evaluated in a cycle true and
bit true emulation platform in order to demonstrate its feasibility and per-
formance in a dense network.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present
the related work on the jamming attack and mitigation. In Section 3, we overview
the WLAN frame format to discuss the security implications of frame headers,
and propose the persistent jamming attack based on the security limitations of
frame headers. In Section 4, we present the experimental setup and demonstrate
the evaluation results. In Section 5, we recommend security remedies. The paper
is concluded in Section 6.
2 Related Work
In this section, we present the related literature on jamming attack and mitigation.
2.1 Jamming Attack
Wireless LAN networks are highly sensitive to incidental and intentional in-
terferences because they use a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoid-
ance (CSMA/CA) mechanism and an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) modulation. IEEE 802.11-based WLAN devices defer access to a chan-
nel if the channel is busy at the transmitter or if it cannot decode the distorted
OFDM modulated symbols at the receiver when the interference exceeds a spec-
iﬁed tolerance level. Interference occurs when a node transmits a signal without
verifying whether another node is accessing the same channel through increas-
ing the clear channel assessment (CCA) threshold. In this way, the malicious
node achieves its goal by degrading the signal quality at legitimate receivers
or by disabling channel access at legitimate transmitters to disrupt the com-
munication link or shut down legitimate devices. Thus, the availability of the
wireless network is subverted easily through jamming attacks, which easily al-
low an attacker to disturb the wireless devices’communications through emitting
electromagnetic signals in the wireless medium. Recently, increasing jamming
attacks have been reported because attackers can easily disrupt wireless com-
munications networks using commercial jamming devices and easily modiﬁed
commercial products [8, 10, 17, 26].
There are two types of jammers: proactive jammers and reactive jammers.
The proactive jammers have three forms: constant, random, and deceptive [10].

As their names imply, the constant jammer and random jammer emit a constant
jamming signal continuously and jamming signals at random times, respectively,
while the deceptive jammer injects decodable packets into the channel. Proactive
jammers are the most prevalent jamming form due to their easy implementa-
tion that attempts to emit jamming signals irrespective of the traﬃc pattern
in the channel, but they are ineﬃcient in terms of attacking damage, detection
probability, and energy eﬃciency due to the lack of channel awareness. In con-
trast, reactive jammers only emit a jamming signal if the channel is busy. If
there is no traﬃc in the current channel, the reactive jammer waits and senses
the channel for a predetermined time, and then switches to a busy channel and
continues to jam. It is a more eﬀective jamming attack even though the imple-
mentation is relatively complicated. This channel awareness allows for eﬃcient
jamming because it must transmit short jamming signals in a timely manner.
The authors of [26] developed a software-deﬁned reactive jammer prototype and
demonstrated that a real-time reactive jammer is feasible and a serious threat
to WLAN services. However, previous studies on the reactive jammer assuming
non-dense networks [10, 17, 26] are limited because it has a low attack success
rate when the target device switches to a diﬀerent channel in a dense network
because conventional jammers cannot diﬀerentiate a speciﬁc device or target
group of devices from multiple candidates. In this paper, we focus on a realis-
tic environment, i.e. a dense network, in which there are multiple devices using
diﬀerent channels and, in Section 5, we experimentally demonstrate that the
existing reactive jamming is not eﬀective in dense networks.
2.2 Jamming Mitigation
Traditionally, channel hopping and link adaptation techniques have been devel-
oped as solutions that mitigate the eﬀect of jamming [1, 14, 16, 19, 22, 23, 31].
Channel hopping techniques attempt to avoid jammed channels through chang-
ing the channel among the orthogonally available channel bands. There are three
types of channel hopping schemes: proactive, reactive, and passive. A pair of
nodes using proactive channel hopping has a hopping sequence that periodically
changes [14]. In a reactive channel hopping scheme, a node only switches to a
diﬀerent channel if it detects the presence of jamming signal [1, 16, 19, 23]. If a
coordinator or pair of nodes decides to switch channels, all other nodes in the
network switch channels as well. Consequently, the proactive channel hopping
schemes are fast, but they are not used in WLANs due to their ineﬃciency and
complexity, whereas reactive channel hopping schemes are slow but are used in
WLAN products. In some commercial devices, passive-type channel hopping us-
ing ﬁrmware enables users to switch channels [24], and users can switch channels
manually if the link is disconnected. However, passive channel hopping schemes
require much longer to avoid interference and could worsen the situation. In
addition, the IEEE 802.11h standard deﬁnes the dynamic frequency selection
(DFS) mechanism in order to avoid interference from radars and other WLAN
devices [3]. The DFS mechanism allows an AP and its associated stations to
dynamically switch to another channel in order to avoid interference.
366
I.-G. Lee et al.
Link adaptation techniques can be used to improve link quality in order to
compete with dynamically varying interference [22, 24, 31]. A node can miti-
gate the jamming eﬀect in order to cause the link to be more robust using link
adaptation schemes such as transmit power control (TPC), modulation and cod-
ing scheme (MCS) control, and CCA threshold control. Link adaptation schemes
can be eﬀective against jammers that follow the equivalent isotropically radiated
power (EIRP) regulations determined by the Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC), but a malicious jammer may transmit signals without considering
the transmit power limitations and emit radio interference with external power
ampliﬁers even if the output is saturated. Therefore, typical legitimate nodes
ﬁrst attempt to adapt the link through controlling the system parameters, and
then they switch channels if the error rate or link quality does not meet the
system requirements.
In order to mitigate jamming attacks, the authors in [10] and [28] proposed
a series of basic detection methods based on the PHY layer. The basic concept
of detecting the jamming attacks was simple: the presence of jamming radio
signals at the receiver can aﬀect the received signal strength. In addition, there
have been several studies on jamming eﬀect analyses and interference mitigation
methods [16,23,24]. The authors analyzed the jamming eﬀects on WLAN systems
and presented the TPC and rate control as competition against jammers. In
order to achieve this, they presented a smart jammer model that scans the
entire spectrum of channels, locates a busy channel, and attacks again. However,
in highly dense networks and congested spectra, the attacker cannot identify
speciﬁc target nodes or a target group because there are numerous candidates,
and the busy state does not guarantee that the target devices will be in the
channel. Thus, the attacker cannot continue to attack the target devices in dense
networks.
3 Our Persistent Jamming Attack
This section introduces the tracking approaches of PHY PAID and device ﬁn-
gerprint to trace the channel hopping target nodes that hop channels while
communicating with the AP in order to avoid jamming attacks. We review the
frame format and depict the limitations from a security perspective in Section
3.1. In Sections 3.2 and 3.3, we describe the persistent jamming attack mecha-
nism that includes the tracking and jamming techniques using PAID and device
ﬁngerprints such as SNR and timing oﬀset.
3.1 Security Limitations
As shown in Figure 1, even though a target node switches to another channel
in order to avoid jamming attacks, a persistent jammer can identify the target
node’s channel frequency based on the frame header information: the ID infor-
mation in the signal ﬁeld and the device ﬁngerprint from the preamble. Then,
the attacker can use this information to attack more eﬀectively in ways such
as tracking and jamming target devices, or jamming at a speciﬁc time or fre-
quency. Therefore, through capturing a single packet and examining its header,
an adversary can determine the existence of the target in a channel.

The frame header information is becoming more important because modern
wireless communication systems have been designed to support advanced trans-
mission techniques for high throughput, high energy eﬃciency, and quality of
service (QoS). Therefore, frame headers include more information for wireless
connectivity in the evolving Wi-Fi standards. Frame headers are transmitted
using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation and the lowest rate trans-
mission mode (6 Mbps) in order to ensure reliable reception. However, frame
headers do not have protection mechanisms, but the data payload is protected
by security protocols and encryption techniques. The encrypted data payload
uses cryptography to protect the data against eavesdropping, tampering, forg-
ing, and other security attacks. Even if the frame is intercepted, the encryption
causes the data payload to be unusable. However, the unencrypted header that
contains the PAID and device ﬁngerprint is not protected: if the channel fre-
quency of a transmitted packet is tracked, an adversary can easily jam the link
to prevent communication. This is a signiﬁcant threat to wireless device users be-
cause the channel frequency usage is important privacy information in a wireless
network, and this data can be tracked and jammed by an attacker.
Figure 1 presents the frame structure of the IEEE 802.11ac standard spec-
iﬁed in [4]. A frame contains a header, payload, frame check sequence (FCS),
and padding/tails. The frame header consists of a preamble, signal ﬁelds, ser-
vice ﬁeld, and medium access control (MAC) header. The PHY frame header
is used in the signal detection, timing acquisition, and signal decoding informa-
tion, and the MAC frame header includes the address information and control
signals. The frame body ﬁeld contains variable length data information which
can be encrypted. The L-STF is used for carrier sensing, gain control, and coarse
frequency acquisition; the L-LTF is used for ﬁne frequency acquisition and chan-
nel estimation. The signal ﬁelds convey information about the rate, length, and
transmission mode for the receiver to decode the remainder of the received frame.
The VHT-STF is used for ﬁne gain control, and the VHT-LTF is used for chan-
nel estimation of the VHT frames. The VHT-SIG-B is used for user-speciﬁc
information in multi-user transmissions. The service ﬁeld is originally used to
initialize the descrambler. In the data ﬁelds, the receiver decodes the incoming
symbols and tracks phase errors using pilots. Any receiver can detect the PAID
included in the VHT-SIG-A or extract the device ﬁngerprint from the STFs and
LTFs because the frame header is not protected. In the IEEE 802.11ac/ah/af
standard, the PAID in the physical (PHY) layer header is adopted in order to
improve the power eﬃciency for a speciﬁc user’s device. The PAID information is
