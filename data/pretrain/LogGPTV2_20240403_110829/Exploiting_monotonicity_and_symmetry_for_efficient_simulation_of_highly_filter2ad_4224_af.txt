positive tilting parameters.
Proposition A.1 (Weight inequality). If f is monotonically
non-decreasing in xi for some i ∈ [m] then under the order-
preserving heuristic, for all x ∈ X = [0, 1]m and 0 ≤ xi ≤

(cid:2)
i) in
Y, one obtains a more representative subset of Xγ.
3) Exponential distributions.: A challenge when applying
our method to exponential distributions is that the maximum
weight can grow to inﬁnity for the case of exponentially-
distributed proposals. However, if there is a threshold T be-
yond which the value of f does not change, i.e., f (x−i, xi) =
f (x−i, T ) for all xi ≥ T ,
then we can replace Xi ∼
Exponential(λi) with Xi ∼ ExpUnif(λi; T )—where Xi is ex-
ponentially distributed with parameter λi on [0, T ], uniformly
distributed on (T, T +1], and has zero mass everywhere else—
without affecting the value of the rare event probability ρ.
Unlike exponential distributions, the ExpUnif distribution does
not have a right tail as its support is bounded on [0, T + 1].
Furthermore, if ExpUnif(; T ) is used as proposal distributions,
then the order-preserving heuristic is maintained if θi ≥ λi.
B. Proposition IV.1
Proof. Using Bayes’ theorem and law of total probability,
Inequality (11) can be rewritten as
P(X ∈ Xγ|Xi ≤ xi)P(Xi ≤ xi)
P(X ∈ Xγ)
≥ P(Xi ≤ xi)
⇔ P(X ∈ Xγ|Xi ≤ xi) ≥ P(X ∈ Xγ)
⇔ P(X ∈ Xγ|Xi ≤ xi) ≥ P(X ∈ Xγ|Xi ≤ xi)P(Xi ≤ xi )
+ P(X ∈ Xγ|Xi > xi)P(Xi > xi)
⇔ P(X ∈ Xγ|Xi ≤ xi) ≥ P(X ∈ Xγ|Xi > xi)
The last inequality means that for every xi, knowing Xi ≤ xi
increases (or at least does not decrease) the probability that
X is in Xγ. To prove this result, we show that the following
inequality holds for every x−i ∈ X−i
P(X∈Xγ|Xi≤xi, X−i=x−i) ≥ P(X∈Xγ|Xi>xi, X−i=x−i)

where x−i = (x1, x2, . . . , xi−1, xi+1, . . . , xm). Let x

C. Proposition IV.2
log(wθ(x−i, 0)) −
Proof. It
log(wθ(x−i, 1)) ≤ 0. After
simpliﬁcation, we have
log(wθ(x−i, 0)) − log(wθ(x−i, 1)) = g(pi) − g(θi) where
g(x) = log(1−x)−log(x). Since g(x) is a decreasing function
in x for x ∈ (0, 1) and θi ≤ pi according to our parameter
selection strategy based on Proposition IV.1, it follows that
g(pi) ≤ g(θi).

E. Illustration of weight degeneracy
The following example illustrates the effect of weight de-
generacy in a low-dimensional setting. Let f (X) = X 2
1 + X 2
where X = (X1, X2), X1 ∼ Beta(8, 4), X2 ∼ Beta(9, 5), and
2
X1 and X2 are mutually independent. Let ρ = P(f (X) ≤ γ).
For γ = 0.2, we obtain ρ ≈ 1.220 × 10
−4 via numerical inte-
gration. Suppose we want to estimate ρ using IS. Furthermore,
our choice of sampling distribution is the Beta-distributed
proposal Pθ, where θ = (a1, b1, a2, b2), Xi ∼ Beta(ai, bi)
for i = 1, 2, and X1 and X2 are mutually independent.
Figures 5a and 5b show the performance of the IS estima-
tors using θ(0) = (8, 4, 9, 5) (i.e., the original distribution),
θ(1) = (8, 44.1, 9, 47.4), and θ(2) = (8, 18.8, 9, 19.3). Overall,
Pθ(2) strikes the right balance between having a moderate
hitting rate and a benign weight degeneracy. As a result,
Pθ(2) achieves a 20x reduction in terms of RE compared to
Pθ(1), even though Pθ(1) achieves over 99% hitting rate. In
fact, θ(2) is the solution to the MWM method. Compared to
Pθ(0), Pθ(1), and Pθ(2), P∗ simultaneously achieves a perfect
hitting rate and zero variance. However, it is unlikely that
P∗ ∈ PΘ since Xi’s are jointly distributed under P∗—i.e.,
P∗
(Xi = xi)—even when they are
mutually independent under P.
