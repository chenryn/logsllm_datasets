Table IV: The top ﬁve malicious domains using non-auto-corrected
misspellings to poison English search terms. The websites typically
contain malicious software download or collect personal information.
While domains 0catch.com and atspace.name themselves are
not intended for malicious activities, cybercriminals utilize the sites’
free hosting to promote malicious content through misspelled keywords.
present the top ﬁve languages in Table III for the whole dataset,
the Alexa domains, and the categories with higher malicious
activity. The international ﬂavor of the Alexa domain dataset
probably explains the low percentage of English predictions
for the Alexa misspellings as many of the top sites serve non-
English speakers. Similarly, the lower prevalence of English
predictions for the drug’s misspellings likely stems from the
many unusual drug product names.
Domains (with blacklisted URLs) indexed by multiple
misspelled keywords. To better understand how attackers apply
linguistic-collision misspelling SEO, we analyze the mapping
between misspelled keywords and domains containing blacklisted
URLs. Figure 9 displays the CDF of the number of non-auto-
corrected misspellings poisoned by the same domains.
In total, for English we saw 1,872 poisoned searches and
538 for Chinese. We observed a distinct difference in SEO
tactics with Chinese attackers carefully using paid infrastructure
(e.g., xinnet.com) and English search poisoners utilizing free
hosting services (e.g., atspace.name). While only 14.1% of
the English domains appeared for more than one misspelling,
38.6% of Chinese domains appeared more than once. For English
we observed 1,404 malicious domains that together used 2,394
unique blacklisted URLs indicating that some search results
contained several blacklisted URLs. While some URLs were
optimized to rank for several misspellings, the majority of URLs
were targeted at a single misspelling. Rather than attempt to
build content with many misspellings, which might cause search
engines and users to conclude the content is low quality, the
attackers create over 100 webpages, each targeting different
misspellings. The Chinese dataset contained 179 domains that
deployed 264 URLs. In contrast to the English attacker’s reliance
on free hosting services to create many highly targeted pages,
the Chinese domains tend to be paid and optimized for a wider
variety of search terms.
In addition to considering the high level statistics, we also ex-
amined the ﬁve most successful second-level domains in the En-
glish dataset, which are shown in Table IV. Examining how these
sites achieve such effectiveness, we ﬁnd that wannajizz.com,
hdvidzpro.me, and theunderweardrawer.co.uk use
misspelled URLs and page titles to appear in the ﬁrst page. On
the other hand, the *.0catch.com and *.atspace.name
campaigns each used pages targeted at a single original term
Figure 9: Cumulative distribution function of the number of indexed
misspelled keywords that were poisoned by the same domain. Note that
38.6% of Chinese domains poisoned more than one misspelling search
result, while only 14.1% of the English domains appeared for multiple
misspelling searches. The disparity between the English and Chinese
results indicates that the English attackers target individual terms, while
the Chinese domains contain a wider variety of misspellings.

Table V: Device breakdown estimates obtained from the Google
Adwords Keyword Planner (we only use the relative numbers returned
by Google Adwords as most of the data is imprecise) and Baidu Index.
“Original Keywords” estimates market segmentation for all original
English and Chinese terms, while “Misspellings Targeted by Attackers”

English and Chinese misspellings in the gambling, drugs, software,
and adult term categories.
by enumerating hundreds of misspellings. While the resulting
text does not appear coherent to a human, the content is
obviously sophisticated enough to convince the search algorithms.
Together, these sites provide an interesting view into how the
truly successful attackers achieve SEO for linguistic-collision
misspellings and also how they monetize their trafﬁc.
C. Search Volume Analysis
To understand how attackers are able to achieve proﬁtability
with the linguistic-collision technique, we used the Google
Adwords [33] toolsuite for the English dataset and Baidu
Index [32] for the Chinese dataset.
Mobile and desktop trafﬁc breakdown. The device break-
down provides insight into how users arrive at the linguistic-
collision misspelling results. While in general
the device
breakdown has similar characteristics between the original and
misspelled keywords, Table V shows that keywords from the
traditional spam categories (gambling, drugs, software, and adult
terms) attract a much higher percentage of mobile users. These
results indicate that attackers may tend to target mobile users
who are much more likely to misspell words by fat-ﬁngering.
Average search volume. To estimate how many users are
exposed to blacklisted search results, we collected search volume
for the Chinese non-auto-corrected misspellings from Baidu

Figure 10: Trafﬁc volume estimates obtained from Baidu Index tool-
suite for the Chinese results. The x-axis is the estimated number of
searches per day and the y-axis is the cumulative distribution function
of individual category. From top to bottom, the curves represent all
of the Chinese uncorrected misspellings and the Chinese poisoned
misspellings. Note that poisoned misspellings actually receive higher
trafﬁc than the other cases indicating that the attackers carefully choose
the optimum misspellings.
Index (unfortunately Google Adwords no longer offers API
access to trafﬁc volumes). Figure 10 displays the average daily
search volume for all of the uncorrected misspellings and the
poisoned misspellings. Although many of the poisoned search
terms receive little trafﬁc, some may achieve proﬁtability as
21.5% of the poisoned terms receive over 1,000 searches a
day. The respectable search volumes per misspelling coupled
with the fact that many of these attackers can appear for many
misspellings could allow attackers to accumulate signiﬁcant
trafﬁc volumes. Even more worrisome, the search volume results
suggest that the attackers are now incentivized to increase their
attacks and that the remaining attack surface is actually rather
large.
Rankings of search results. One might hope that the blacklisted
URLs would be relegated to the bottom of the search results.
However, we ﬁnd that the attackers have managed to be ranked
ﬁrst for 9.5% of the English results. The Chinese blacklisted
URLs were less successful with only 2.7% as the ﬁrst result. As
shown in Figure 11, the positions of blacklisted search results
for the English URLs appear to follow a uniform distribution,
while the Chinese results show comparatively lower ranking.
The disparity between the English and Chinese again seems to
indicate that the Baidu ranking algorithm prioritizes reputed
content sources (see Section VI-A).
D. Case Studies
To further explain how the attackers use linguistic-collision
misspelling, we investigate two interesting cases that highlight
both attacker incentives and methods.
“Gambling siti” and “hayday loans online”. A campaign
(involving 89 URLs ) mixes content in several languages
(with an emphasis on Germanic languages such as English,
Finish, and German) to promote advertisements. For example,
raswearsh.890m.com appears as the fourth result of the
search“gambling siti” which is a misspelling of “gambling site”
where “siti” is Italian for site. The webpage uses “Siti Gambling”
as the title.
Figure 11: Cumulative percentage of blacklisted URLs in search results
for decreasing search result position. Note that some URLs appeared
in several search pages so we treat each appearance separately when
calculating the CDF.
By searching small snippets of text from collected attacks, we
easily ﬁnd over 100 other attack URLs using the same snippets
to promote a variety of products. Because the resulting pages
have valid words (albeit in different languages), the attackers
are able to rank in the top 10 search results of misspellings
for adult sites, payday loans, gambling, writing services, and
options trading kits. To monetize the trafﬁc, each site uses
afﬁliate marketing programs that lead to malicious downloads or
phishing pages. For instance, a search for “hayday loans online”
(originally “payday loans online”) returns gin.890m.com,
where “hay” is a Spanish word meaning “there are”. The website
hosts a sign-up form from leadapi.net which asks users
for social security numbers, date of birth, and bank account
information. We ﬁnd the campaign contains at least 20 websites
similar to gin.890m.com.
XieHe media
(“协协协 和和和 影影影 视视视”). A malicious website
sds.ccbkr.com has the title “协 和 影 视”. The website
induces users to install malicious software with free movies,
and also displays various advertisements related with gambling
and adult content. However, the title “协和” is the same as the
name of a large, well-known hospital in China. If a user directly
searches for “协和” on Baidu, most of the returned results are
related to that hospital. Indeed, the website sds.ccbkr.com
will be positioned as the 93rd in the search results (far away
from the ﬁrst page) and it is unlikely that users will reach and
click the search result. On the other hand, if a user searches the
misspelled keyword “谐和” (which has the same pronunciation
as “协和”), the malicious website will show as the ﬁrst in the
search results. Cybercriminals abuse the Chinese misspelling
with the same pinyin to achieve higher rank in the search engine.
In addition, we ﬁnd ccbkr.com sets wildcard DNS records
to display the illicit content on arbitrary subdomains.
VII. MITIGATION DISCUSSION
Based on our ﬁndings, we propose several potential mitigation
strategies. Although afﬁliate networks should hold their afﬁliates
responsible for participating in linguistic-collision misspelling
SEO, the afﬁliate programs may lack the incentive to enforce
such a policy. Realistically, the search engine providers are
probably in the best position to defend against linguistic-collision
1322

misspelling by proactively correcting search variants to better
protect users from attackers. While auto-correction services have
improved signiﬁcantly, the services could potentially beneﬁt
from other data sources. For example, Google Translate data
could be used to identify illogical word combinations, words
that are outside of the user’s normal language, and words that
are existent within the language but very rarely used. In addition,
search engine providers, such as Google and Baidu, could put
forward a more restrictive policy to limit users from purchasing
misspelled search keywords and further disincentive afﬁliate
networks caught using linguistic-collision misspellings.
Finally, free hosting services should more strictly enforce the
terms and conditions of use for attackers that are utilizing these
services to obtain free infrastructure. While we only mentioned
0-catch.com and atspace.name previously, we observed
several other hosting sites (uol.com.br was another repeat
offender) that were allowing attackers to promote dangerous
or misleading ads (including at least one pyramid scheme).
Enforcing the terms and conditions for these hosting sites could
make linguistic-collision misspelling SEO less proﬁtable for the
attackers and associating attacker activity to payment details
should make the miscreants think twice.
VIII. RELATED WORK
Search engine poisoning. A number of studies examine search
engine poisoning where cybercriminals illicitly manipulate search
engine results. deSEO [56] generated URL signatures to detect
malicious pages that are hosted on compromised legitimate
web servers for SEO attacks. SURF [57] designed a browser
plugin to detect redirection chains and poisoned search results.
Leontiadis et al. [58] conducted a measurement based study
on search redirection attacks for online illicit products and
found that the conversion rate was higher than email spam.
Extending the initial work, Leontiadis et al. [39] performed a
four-year longitudinal study to examine the evolution of search
engine poisoning, which highlighted a set of trafﬁc redirectors
and showed that the overall scale of search poisoning attacks
had increased steadily. Liao et al. [59] focused on long-tail
search-result manipulation that uses cloud hosting platforms.
Wang et al. [60] studied the problem of exploiting autocomplete
of suggested queries on search engines to promote illicit content.
Our research differs from previous search poisoning work in
that we focus on linguistic-collision misspellings, a sophisticated
class of attacks, which evade current auto-correction defenses to
poison search results. We conduct the ﬁrst large-scale analysis
to understand and characterize the abuse of linguistic-collision
misspellings to spread malicious content via search results.
Domain typosquatting. In domain typosquatting, attackers
register domain names that are purposefully similar to reputed
domains. Szurdi et al. [47] investigated long-tail typosquatting
registrations, by combining both passive and active domain
features to categorize typosquatting domains. Agten et al. [44]
focused on a sizeable set of typosquatting targets by using
crawled data over a seven-month monitoring period. They
found that typosquatting versions of popular domains appear
to change owners more frequently and few trademark own-
ers protect themselves by registering typosquatting domains.
Nikiforakis et al. [61] studied bit ﬂips in DNS requests (i.e., bit-
squatting), where random bit-errors occurring in the memory of
commodity hardware can redirect Internet trafﬁc to compromised
domains. Khan et al. [45] quantiﬁed the harm of typosquatting
and found that a typical user loses a second when visiting a
typosquatting domain. Kintis et al. [62] studied a speciﬁc type
of domain squatting, termed “combosquatting,” where attackers
register domains that combine a popular trademark with one or
more phrases. They found that combosquatting is used to perform
a spectrum of different types of abuse including phishing, social
engineering, afﬁliate abuse, trademark abuse, and even advanced
persistent threats. In addition, several studies have suggested
domain squatters often use domain parking services to monetize
their holdings [63–65]. Though the attack that we study has a
similar incentive to monetize on misspelled user inputs, unlike
traditional domain typosquatting, linguistic-collision misspellings
circumvent current auto-correction defenses by using legitimate
words in other languages.
Security analysis using deep learning. Recently, recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) were used as a tool for generating fake
Yelp reviews that are able to evade detection by humans and
existing algorithms [12]. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks are a special type of RNN that have the ability
to remember long-term dependencies over sequences. LSTM
networks have been applied to solve various security problems,
such as vulnerability detection [66], website ﬁngerprinting [67],
and system logs anomaly identiﬁcation [11]. In our work, we
