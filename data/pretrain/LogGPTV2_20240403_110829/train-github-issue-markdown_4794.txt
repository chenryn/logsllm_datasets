Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-use-responsive-design-
with-bootstrap-fluid-containers has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce
it, and include links to screenshots if possible.
When instructed to wrap all html elements in div this Waypoint gives you
credit prematurely (by simply creating a div) not necessarily wrapping all the
elements.
It logical for me since I am very familiar with HTML but maybe for new html
user it would not be obvious that you have to move closing tag to below all
other tags since exercise validates without that action...
