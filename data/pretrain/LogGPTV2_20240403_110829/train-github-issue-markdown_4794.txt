### Issue Report: FreeCodeCamp Challenge - Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers

**Challenge URL:**  
[http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-use-responsive-design-with-bootstrap-fluid-containers](http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-use-responsive-design-with-bootstrap-fluid-containers)

**Issue Description:**

The challenge instructs users to wrap all HTML elements in a `<div>` container. However, the validation system grants credit prematurely if the user simply creates a `<div>` tag, without necessarily wrapping all the elements within it.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Navigate to the challenge at the provided URL.
2. Follow the instructions to create a `<div>` element.
3. Notice that the challenge is marked as completed even if the `<div>` does not fully encapsulate all the HTML elements.

**Expected Behavior:**

The challenge should only be marked as completed when the `<div>` tag fully wraps around all the HTML elements, ensuring that the closing `</div>` tag is placed after all other elements.

**Actual Behavior:**

The challenge is marked as completed as soon as a `<div>` tag is created, regardless of whether it properly wraps all the elements.

**Additional Notes:**

For experienced HTML users, it may be clear that the closing `</div>` tag needs to be placed after all other elements. However, for new learners, this might not be immediately obvious, and the current validation can lead to confusion.
