### Bot Service Description and Rationale

| **Control** | **Severity** | **Automated Fix Script** | **Description and Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bot Service API must only be accessible over HTTPS** | High | No | Using HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks. |
| **Use own storage adapter instead of Bot Framework State Service API** | High | No | Utilizing your own storage adapter ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest, minimizing the risk of data loss from physical theft and helping meet regulatory compliance requirements. |
| **Proper handling of secrets in Bot Service** | High | No | Storing secrets such as passwords and keys in clear text can lead to easy compromise at various points during an application's lifecycle. Proper handling is essential. |
| **Logging of important activities and events during Bot interactions** | Medium | Yes | Logging important activities and events can help detect unusual usage behavior patterns through analytics. |
| **Only specific/required channels must be configured to allow traffic to bot service** | High | Yes | Enabling only the required channels for the Bot minimizes unnecessary attack vectors. Each enabled channel exposes the bot to potential activity on that channel. |

This table outlines the key controls and their rationale for ensuring the security and compliance of your Bot Service.
