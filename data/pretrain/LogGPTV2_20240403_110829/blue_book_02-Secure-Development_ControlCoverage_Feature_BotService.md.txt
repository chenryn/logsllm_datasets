BotServiceDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptBot Service API must only be accessible over HTTPSUse of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.HighNoNoEnsure to use own storage adapter instead of Bot Framework State Service API.Using this feature ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest. This minimizes the risk of data loss from physical theft and also helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.HighNoNoSecrets in Bot Service must be handled properly.Keeping secrets such as passwords, keys, etc. in clear text can lead to easy compromise at various avenues during an application's lifecycle.HighNoNoMake sure important activities and events during Bot interactions are logged.Analytics can be useful to detect unusual usage behavior patterns.MediumYesNoOnly specific/required channels must be configured to allow traffic to bot service.Each channel enabled for the Bot exposes the bot to activity on that channel. If a channel that is not actually required is enabled for the bot, it introduces unnecessary avenues for attack.HighYesNo
