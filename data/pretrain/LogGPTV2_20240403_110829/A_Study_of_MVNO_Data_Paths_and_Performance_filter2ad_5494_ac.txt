consistent latency across all data center locations, but interestingly favors CDN
servers in Chicago, 2,961 km away from San Jose. Similar to A-1, we believe this
is likely due to D-1 being a full MVNO, with traﬃc traversing a diﬀerent core
network than the base MNO.
Overall, we observe that some MVNOs exhibit drastically diﬀerent RTT per-
formance from their MNO counterparts, while others are similar. While it seems
that the light MVNO can be characterized as simply a re-branded version of
the base MNO, our experiments using full MVNOs show unique latencies and
resolutions between them and their MNOs. Thus, these carriers do not appear to
simply reﬂect the performance of the MNO network on which they reside. Such
behaviors will clearly impact network latency and throughput and may help to
explain why MVNOs networks generally perform worse than MNOs.

lengths but diﬀer in the number of hops taken to reach the destination.
4.3 Autonomous System Paths and Hop Counts
We next investigate traﬃc routes with respect to autonomous system (AS)
paths in the traceroutes for each carrier to non-location speciﬁc servers. We
use whois queries to map all IP addresses seen in carrier traceroutes to AS
numbers. Figure 3(a) shows the number of unique AS numbers observed across
the carriers, with the dark line indicating the mean. As shown, it appears as
though MVNO behavior overall is similar to MNO networks. This result illus-
trates that MVNO networks are bound to some degree to the MNO network
conﬁguration. We study the actual AS numbers traversed by traﬃc between
MNOs and MVNOs and ﬁnd that they generally match, and as such omit this
analysis for brevity. Interestingly, although carriers A-1, C-1, and D-1 all fall
under the ‘same’ MVNO brand, traﬃc for each client behaves diﬀerently based
on the underlying carrier. It appears that in terms of AS paths, MVNOs closely
reﬂect the underlying MNO. These results lead us to investigate hop counts to
help explain performance diﬀerences between MVNOs and MNOs.
We consider the total number of hops in traceroute records for traﬃc on
each mobile network to non-location speciﬁc servers. We only consider records
that reach the destination server. Figure 3(b) shows the results. As with other
metrics, we observe considerable variability between carriers. Carriers A and D
both use dramatically fewer hops to reach the server compared to their respective
MVNOs, while carriers B and C closely resemble their respective MVNOs. The
path length inﬂation seen on carriers A-1 and D-1 could help explain poorer
RTT performance compared to the base carrier. We also observe that MVNOs
A-1, C-1, and D-1, which are all marketed as the same carrier, experience very
diﬀerent length paths to reach the destination servers. We believe the variance
may be attributable to the diﬀerent preferred locations observed in Fig. 2.
4.4 Geographic Path Analysis
Lastly, we study the geographic paths taken by traﬃc on each mobile provider
going to speciﬁc CDN locations. This analysis provides us visual insight into

the carrier network behavior and performance. Figure 4 illustrates hops taken
by traceroutes over our two-week experiment where the destination servers are
located in Los Angeles, CA (140 km away from our location in Santa Barbara,
CA). Due to space limitations, we only include plots for Los Angeles and four car-
riers, as it is representative for all locations observed and illustrates the contrast
between full and light MVNOs. The ﬁgures indicate the diﬀerences in behav-
ior between MVNOs and their base carriers. For instance, carrier A (Fig. 4(a))
clearly operates over diﬀerent, more stable routes compared with its correspond-
ing MVNO (Fig. 4(b)). This helps explain why there is such a marked diﬀerence
in performance between the two when connecting to various data centers. Car-
riers B and B-1 (Fig. 4(c) and (d)), on the other hand, are quite similar to one
another. This result depicts the diﬀerence between light and full MVNOs, where
the light MVNO (B-1) routes traﬃc in the same way as the base MNO, while
full MVNOs that implement their own core are inﬂuenced by outside factors and
diﬀer from their respective base carriers.
A curious ﬁnding is that many of the carriers, particularly the MVNOs,
contain paths that pass through Los Angeles only to continue with subsequent
hops in distant locations before ﬁnally returning to Los Angeles. This seems to
indicate the lack of peering between the network that the earlier Los Angeles
hop is within and the content provider located in Los Angeles. This behavior is
interesting given that [9] found three of the four major US MNOs have peering

arrangements with Google servers in Los Angeles. The propagation delay intro-
duced by such scenarios can be considerable, without accounting for additional
potential for congestion or queuing delays. Bottlenecks such as these must be
removed in order for mobile data to shrink the performance gap between mobile
and traditional wired connectivity.
Overall, path visualization gives us an increased understanding of how car-
riers diﬀer. The full MVNOs that we measure share many locations with their
underlying MNO, but their routes are more frenetic. This could be due to dif-
ferent peering arrangements versus the base carrier or simply due to diﬀerent
overall Internet connectivity. We also see that the light MVNO in our study
closely resembles its base carrier. Given all that we have observed it seems clear
that light MVNOs are, at their foundation, re-branded base carriers.
5 Related Work
There has been signiﬁcant eﬀort towards measuring, characterizing, and improv-
ing the performance of cellular network infrastructure with respect to the user
experience [9,14,15]. Sommers et al. [14] compare the performance of cellular and
WiFi networks using a crowdsourced approach for measuring network through-
put. Nikrashev et al. [15] measure longitudinal performance from end-devices
to uncover the prevalence of middleboxes in mobile networks. Zariﬁs et al. [9]
use end-devices to identify latency caused by inﬂated routes and the relation-
ships between user performance, Internet ingress points, and peering agreements.
Similar to previous work, we use measurements from the end-user perspective
to understand the impacts of network infrastructure on user experience.
Zarinni et al. [4] compare application performance over two major carriers
and three MVNOs per carrier. Our work focuses on performance with respect to
underlying network layers (e.g. latency and route paths) and considers all four
major U.S. carriers and MVNOs operating on top of each.
As cellular networks become the primary mode of Internet connectivity,
research eﬀorts have focused on the analysis of the impact of content placement
and network conﬁguration on end-user experience [6,9]. Zariﬁs et al. [9] ﬁnd
that route inﬂation leads to increased RTT experienced by end users connecting
from locations with limited infrastructure. Rula et al. [6] explores the relation-
ship between cellular DNS infrastructure and the location of selected content
replicas, ﬁnding that instability of cellular DNS resolvers signiﬁcantly degrades
the experience of mobile users. We ﬁnd that locations of resolved content servers
are not universally attributable to one single factor.
6 Discussion and Conclusion
Given the results of our measurement study, what are the overriding lessons?
Round Trip Times. We observe that round trip times vary signiﬁcantly
between MNOs as well as MVNOs. Additionally, we see that location of des-
tination servers drastically aﬀects RTTs, and resolved server locations do not

appear to be logical in that they are often physically distant from the client
location. Such behavior could be the result of mobile carrier peering arrange-
ments, DNS infrastructure, and Internet ingress points. Future work should focus
on making more eﬃcient network topologies in order to close the performance
gap between mobile carriers.
Route Paths. We ﬁnd that MVNOs typically traverse the same autonomous
systems as their MNO counterparts in their paths to reach servers. However,
we often observe a higher number of hops on the MVNOs. The root cause of
such path inﬂation needs more thorough investigation, as it could be attribut-
able to multiple factors such as: Internet ingress points or middleboxes used for
accounting or traﬃc shaping in the mobile core network. Given our geographic
analysis, we believe that full MVNOs, which operate their own core networks,
route traﬃc through seemingly ineﬃcient paths. Perhaps increasing the num-
ber of ingress/egress points as well as replicating middlebox functionality across
more geographic locations could improve the directness of mobile traﬃc on such
networks.
MNOs vs MVNOs.With the exception of carrier B-1, we observe marked
performance diﬀerences on MVNO networks compared with their underlying
MNO networks. As carrier B-1 is a light MVNO, while the others are all full
MVNOs, we can argue that consumers should expect a diﬀerent user experience
when connecting via full MVNOs compared with base carriers. The observed
light MVNO leads us to conclude that its use is in essence the same as the base
carrier. It remains to be seen whether the same is true for all light MVNOs.
We ﬁnd that full MVNOs tend to share some infrastructure with the MNO,
but that they are less predictable in terms of routing paths. Latency diﬀerences
are also considerable between MNOs and full MVNOs and some variability can
be attributed to destination server location. It seems likely that MVNOs may
have fewer peering agreements with content providers, evidenced by considerably
longer, more circuitous paths taken.
We do not believe that MVNOs, by their nature, are bound to oﬀer inferior
performance compared to MNO carriers. There appears to be multiple avenues
available to explore for MVNO carriers in order to maximize traﬃc eﬃciency.
For researchers, this subject deserves more in-depth, longitudinal studies from
many locations to fully understand performance of these networks. For con-
sumers considering which MVNO or plan is the best option, there is currently
no clear answer. Additionally, the ‘best’ carrier will likely vary based on what
content the user intends to consume on the Internet. The inherent tradeoﬀs
between carriers are worthy of future exploration using real-world user traﬃc.
Limitations. Our measurement study provides only a limited glimpse into the
performance of mobile data networks given a single measurement location and
targeting a small set of servers. A longitudinal, in-depth measurement campaign
is required to fully understand the tradeoﬀs between mobile carriers and content
delivery networks. Measurements also rely on the eﬃcacy of the tools we use,
such as traceroute, and the equal treatment of measurement traﬃc by the
carrier core networks. A larger study must include more real world traﬃc.
