I need to capture the standard output (stdout) from a long-running process that I start using `subprocess.Popen(...)`, so I am using `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` as an argument. However, since this is a long-running process, I also want to display the output on the console in real-time, to give the user of the script an indication that the process is still active.

Is it possible to achieve both capturing the stdout and displaying it on the console simultaneously?

Thank you.

**Response:**

Yes, it is possible to achieve both capturing the stdout and displaying it on the console simultaneously. One approach is to use the `tee` command, which can duplicate the output to both a file and the console. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Using `tee` in a shell command:**
   You can run your process and pipe its output to `tee`, which will then duplicate the output to both a file and the console. For example:
   ```sh
   sh -c 'your_long_running_process' | tee /dev/stderr
   ```
   This command will run `your_long_running_process` and send its output to both the console (via `/dev/stderr`) and to the file specified (or to a variable in your Python script).

2. **Implementing in Python:**
   If you want to handle this directly in Python, you can use the `subprocess` module along with `threading` to read the output in real-time and print it to the console while also capturing it. Here's an example:
   ```python
   import subprocess
   import threading

   def read_output(process):
       for line in iter(process.stdout.readline, b''):
           print(line.decode().strip())

   # Start the process
   process = subprocess.Popen(['your_long_running_process'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)

   # Start a thread to read and print the output
   output_thread = threading.Thread(target=read_output, args=(process,))
   output_thread.start()

   # Wait for the process to complete
   process.wait()
   output_thread.join()
   ```

This way, the output of the long-running process will be printed to the console in real-time, and you can also capture it if needed.

Note that the `tee` solution works well on Unix-like systems, but the Python implementation is cross-platform and provides more control over the process.
