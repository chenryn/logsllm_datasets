Apologies for the abrupt closure. To achieve the desired functionality, I had to implement additional steps, which you can review in my Gist: [http://gist.github.com/422460](http://gist.github.com/422460).

It would be more convenient if this process were automated, allowing me to use `test_request_context` as described in the documentation.
