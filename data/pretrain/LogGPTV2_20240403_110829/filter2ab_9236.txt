titleblackhat:eu-21 Security Industry Call-to-Action: We Need a Cloud Vulnerability Database
The shared responsibility model is broken. Companies are unable to keep up with cloud complexity, while vendors and cloud providers do not provide clear identification, tracking or severity for vulnerabilities discovered in their platforms. Moreover there is an inherent lack of transparency, as cloud providers do not share full details of exposure, impact, or mitigation steps for vulnerabilities discovered in their platform. Join the Wiz Research Team who uncovered several unprecedented cloud vulnerabilities in AWS, GCP and Azure in their journey and conclusions from the disclosure process. We will review key learnings and insights from OMIGOD, ChaosDB and AWS IAM cross-account vulnerabilities we uncovered. In this session we will make the case for extending the current CVE model to be more cloud friendly as the current model is broken and call everyone to join the movement for change.
