Based on [8], we estimate that the top 1% researchers on
HackerOne have an average ratio of 0.54, while the bottom
50% only have an average ratio of 0.03, indicating that ap-
proximately among 100 reports submitted by them, only 3
are expected to be valid vulnerability reports. Bug bounty
platforms have introduced various data-driven approaches,
including reputation systems and rate limiting, to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio [8]. This partly explains the higher
signal-to-noise ratio of bounty platforms over individually
hosted bounty programs. However, the low signal-to-noise
ratio remains a key challenge for eﬀective vulnerability dis-
covery and requires more research eﬀort.
The long-tailed distribution of contribution levels as well
as concerns about accuracy lead to an increased focus on the
top contributors in today’s bug bounty programs, since they
are on average much more productive, and more accurate.
As a result, existing bounty platforms such as HackerOne
and BugCrowd have created private bounty programs that
only invite a small number of top contributors [12, 9, 8].
In some cases, the top contributors were directly hired by
organizations or bounty platforms [4, 7].
Less attention is given to white hats with lower produc-
tivity. However, taken as a group, they contribute a sizable
number of accepted reports. As such, the question arises
how to evaluate their contributions. To do an initial com-
parative assessment, we split the white hat community on
Wooyun into three groups of diﬀerent levels of productiv-
ity. The two thresholds, displayed in Figure 7, are chosen so
that the three groups have approximately the same number
of reports, thus allowing us to compare other dimensions of
their contributions.
We report the results in Table 2. Unsurprisingly, the av-
erage number of accepted reports diﬀers substantially across
these groups. In contrast, an interesting observation is that
the less productive groups have contributed reports for a

ferent productivity levels on Wooyun.
considerably larger number of organizations. There could
be multiple reasons to explain this diﬀerence. First, the
less productive groups have many more white hats, leading
to more “manpower” and more diverse interests covering a
wider range of websites. Meanwhile, white hats in the highly
productive group have more limited attention or may ben-
eﬁt from an increased focus on a speciﬁc set of websites.
Second, some websites may have been particularly popular
targets for white hats, and easy-to-be-found vulnerabilities
are already removed. For many low productive white hats
who may also have limited expertise, spending eﬀort on such
websites might not be cost-eﬀective. Thus, they shift their
attention to other websites, which are more likely to yield
discoveries.
The broader coverage of websites by less productive white
hats has a positive impact on the security of the Inter-
net, since even less popular sites still receive a considerable
amount of visitors every day. In addition, the security of or-
ganizations is rather connected in many ways [22, 33]. For
example, a user could use the same username and password
across multiple sites, and the compromise of one of them will
jeopardize others. Therefore, by complementing the limited
attention of top white hats, the less productive white hat
groups make diﬀerent but important contributions.
We further break down the contributions of each group
by target websites’ popularity and by vulnerability severity.
Rows 5 - 7 of Table 2 show that for the diﬀerent popularity
categories the contributions (in %) across the three produc-
tivity groups are remarkably consistent. In particular, the

of discoveries for popular websites. Row 8 shows that more
productive white hats have a larger percentage of contri-
butions with high severity vulnerabilities, but 28.1% of high
severity vulnerabilities were still discovered by the least pro-
ductive white hats.
In summary, the results support the existence of a sub-
stantial expertise and productivity gap on an individual
level, but from a collective perspective the diﬀerence is smaller
than perhaps expected. How to better utilize the potential
of these diﬀerent groups of white hats is an interesting chal-
lenge. In particular, it would be useful to think about how to
boost the productivity of less productive white hats through
better incentives, training, and other measures.
Skills and Strategies
4.2.3
Next to productivity, we measure two additional metrics:
the number of diﬀerent organizations an individual white hat
investigated, and the number of diﬀerent vulnerability types
an individual white hat reported. These two metrics partly
reﬂect the skills, experiences and strategies of white hats.
Figure 9 shows the distribution of these two metrics for white
hats on Wooyun with more than 5 discoveries. The average
number of organizations investigated by a white hat of this
group is 18, while the average number of vulnerability types
found is 7. The most productive individuals (i.e., red trian-
gles in the ﬁgure) generally surpass others in both metrics
which partially explains the productivity diﬀerence. First,
top white hats’ broad knowledge of diﬀerent types of vulner-
abilities may enable them to discover more vulnerabilities.
Second, they may ﬁnd more vulnerabilities because their
strategy is to investigate a larger number of websites. Fur-
thermore, we hypothesize that there is a trade-oﬀ between
exploration vs. exploitation: to ﬁnd more vulnerabilities, a
white hat must develop a good balance between spending
eﬀort at one particular website and exploring opportunities
on other sites. However, diﬀerent successful strategies co-
exist. For example, our dataset includes several white hats
in the bottom left corner of Figure 9 that is much more fo-
cused on exploitation. Similarly, a white hat named ‘meals’
ranked 4th on HackerOne only focuses on Yahoo’s bounty
platform, and has to-date found 155 vulnerabilities.
Investigating the optimal degree of strategy diversiﬁcation
during web vulnerability hunting is an interesting area for
future work.
4.2.4 Disclosure and Learning
A primary consideration of previous research was to un-
derstand how vulnerability disclosure pushes software ven-
dors to ﬁx ﬂaws in their products [35, 36]. However, when
considering the whole ecosystem, we question whether vul-
nerability disclosures also have positive eﬀects on the white
hat community itself. One possible eﬀect is to enable white
hats to learn valuable technical insights and skills from oth-
ers’ ﬁndings. Another eﬀect is to obtain valuable strate-
gic information for their own vulnerability discovery activ-
ities, such as which organizations to investigate. Both ef-
fects likely improve white hats’ productivity and accuracy.
In addition, the software engineering community and peer
organizations can also learn valuable lessons from vulnera-
bility reports to avoid making similar mistakes in the future.
While the latter factor may be of high practical relevance,
Figure 9: Scatter plot of white hats’ vulnerability type count
and targeted organization count on Wooyun. Each dot rep-
resents a white hat who has found more than 5 vulnerabil-
ities in total. The red triangle dots are white hats of the
high productivity group deﬁned in Section 4.2.2.
we are unaware of related research. In this paper, we inves-
tigate the ﬁrst eﬀect using data from Wooyun.
The Wooyun platform allows white hats to mark and fol-
low a particular report. Therefore, we can use the number
of followers of a vulnerability report as an approximate indi-
cator of its learning value to white hats. In Figure 8, we plot
the distribution of this follower count for all vulnerabilities
on Wooyun, and also break down the data by diﬀerent sever-
ity levels. We observe that the distribution is very skewed.
There are 9,489 reports that have at least 10 followers, in-
dicating that white hats have been actively learning from a
broad portion of reports. On average, high severity vulnera-
bilities have more followers, which is not surprising, as more
severe vulnerabilities tend to have a more signiﬁcant secu-
rity impact, and higher discovery and exploit complexity.
What might be counter-intuitive is that some low severity
vulnerabilities still receive more than 100 followers.
To examine why some vulnerabilities have received much
more attention than others, and why some low severity vul-
nerabilities are followed by many, we selected the 30 most
followed vulnerabilities from each severity level. We then
manually examined these 90 vulnerabilities. We ﬁnd that
these vulnerabilities mostly belong to one or more of the
following categories: (1) Vulnerabilities with signiﬁcant im-
pact (e.g., with a potential for massive user data leakage,
or an XSS inside the site statistics javascript code from a
major search engine company); (2) Vulnerabilities that are
associated with novel discovery or exploitation techniques;
(3) Vulnerabilities of widely used web applications, such as
CMS; (4) Vulnerabilities that are explicitly organized as tu-
torials. We found 21 such tutorial-style reports belonging to
a series about XSS, which are all of low severity, yet they

learning. We also examined a subset of disclosed reports
from HackerOne and have discovered that some organiza-
tions make disclosures3 to teach the writing of concise re-
ports.
In summary, our analysis provides evidence of how white
hats are learning from vulnerability reports; a typically over-
looked beneﬁt of vulnerability disclosure to the white hat
community. We will discuss additional facets of disclosure
in Section 5.1.
4.3 Organizations
We now shift our focus to the organizations who have
participated in vulnerability discovery ecosystems. These
organizations harvest vulnerability reports from the white
hat community, ﬁx security ﬂaws, and thereby ultimately
improve the security of the whole Internet (e.g., by reduc-
ing the impact of security interdependencies [22, 33]). How-
ever, collecting data about them is non-trivial because many
organizations, such as banks, are still reluctant to collabo-
rate with white hats due to various concerns [3]. In addi-
tion, for many organizations who joined platforms such as
HackerOne, data about discovered vulnerabilities, monetary
rewards and other important factors is often not publicly
disclosed.
Size and Growth
Wooyun provides a valuable opportunity to study the im-
pact of such ecosystems on organizations; and not only be-
cause of the existence of the delayed public full disclosure
policy. More importantly, an organization is rather coerced
to join this ecosystem once a white hat publishes a vul-
nerability on Wooyun aﬀecting the organization. This coer-
cive model is diﬀerent from most other platforms which only
host bounty programs for organizations that agree to par-
ticipate (i.e., voluntary model ). Due to the diversity of the
large white hat community, Wooyun covers a broad range
of organizations from many sectors, as we will show in Sec-
tion 4.3.3. As a result, observations made from this dataset
do not only help us understand the web vulnerability dis-
covery ecosystem in China, and the general security status
of the Chinese web, but also help us to envision the impact
of the bug bounty model for organizations in other parts of
the world.
4.3.1
Table 1 lists the number of organizations participating in
representative vulnerability discovery ecosystems. We ob-
serve that Wooyun aﬀects a larger number of organizations
compared with US-based platforms, who typically have tens
or hundreds of participating organizations. The diﬀerence
is partly due to the coercive versus voluntary ways of in-
volving organizations. Therefore, the Wooyun ecosystem
roughly represents an upper bound of coverage (growth) for
other ecosystems. We also investigate the trajectory of the
growth of the number of organizations covered on Wooyun.
Figure 10 shows that in every month, there are about 300
organizations beneﬁting from white hats’ eﬀorts. Around
150 of them are new organizations, which implies that the
white hat community is continuously broadening its horizon.
It would be interesting to understand whether this eﬀect re-
lies on the fact that new businesses are founded (or new
websites become public), or that white hats are moving to
already established but previously unresearched websites.
3For example: https://hackerone.com/reports/32825.
4.3.2 Vulnerability Distribution
For both Wooyun and HackerOne, Figure 11 shows that
only few organizations receive a high number of vulnerabil-
ity reports, while most organizations receive very few vul-
nerability reports. We hypothesize that the number of vul-
nerabilities received by organizations is related to multiple
factors, such as the complexity of the web system, the exis-
tence of monetary incentives, the popularity of the website,
etc. We will further investigate the relation between these
factors and the number of published vulnerability reports in
Section 4.3.7.
4.3.3
To investigate the diversity within participating organiza-
tions, we have manually tagged organizations on HackerOne
based on their business types. We ﬁnd that all participat-
ing companies are IT-focused and cater to diﬀerent busi-
ness/consumer needs which are shown in Table 3.

Table 3: Frequency of IT-business types within the group
of publicly available bounty programs on HackerOne. Only
tags with frequency greater than 3 are shown.
Due to its coercive model for involving organizations, the
Wooyun dataset includes a larger and more diverse set of
organizations (see Figure 12). Further, it shows that white
hats do not exclusively focus on certain business sectors.
For non-IT organizations, two sectors with many vulnera-
bility reports are government and ﬁnance. We consider this
