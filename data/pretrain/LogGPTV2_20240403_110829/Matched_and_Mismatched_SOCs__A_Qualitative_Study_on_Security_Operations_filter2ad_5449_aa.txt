ABSTRACT
Organizations, such as companies and governments, created Secu-
rity Operations Centers (SOCs) to defend against computer security
attacks. SOCs are central defense groups that focus on security inci-
dent management with capabilities such as monitoring, preventing,
responding, and reporting. They are one of the most critical defense
components of a modern organization’s defense.
Despite their critical importance to organizations, and the high
frequency of reported security incidents, only a few research stud-
ies focus on problems specific to SOCs. In this study, to understand
and identify the issues of SOCs, we conducted 18 semi-structured
interviews with SOC analysts and managers who work for orga-
nizations from different industry sectors. Through our analysis of
the interview data, we identified technical and non-technical issues
that exist in SOC. Moreover, we found inherent disagreements be-
tween SOC managers and their analysts that, if not addressed, could
entail a risk to SOC efficiency and effectiveness. We distill these
issues into takeaways that apply both to future academic research
and to SOC management. We believe that research should focus on
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SOCs.

1 INTRODUCTION
Computer security attacks are a significant threat to our society.
Organizations suffer frequent attacks by highly sophisticated and
systematic adversaries with different agendas, and these attacks, if
successful, result in severe consequences to the organizations, their
clients, and their partners.
Many organizations have created Security Operations Centers
(SOCs), generally in the form of a centralized group composed of
security specialists who monitor, prevent, report, and respond to
security attacks. While such SOCs have been shown to help improve
companies’ security posture [22, 28, 39], serious security incidents
remain rampant [40], and the current SOC setup is insufficient to
defend against these attacks.
The reasons why SOCs fail are complicated; representing a mix
of technical and human-centric issues. For example, in 2013, at-
tackers managed to breach Target’s network and steal their data,
despite Target following “industry best practices” by deploying a
$1.6 million malware detection tool and enforcing “reasonable secu-
rity controls in place” [37]. Before this incident occurred, Target’s
subsidiary SOC had successfully detected the issue and reported it
to the main SOC. However, for unknown reasons, the main SOC
did not take further action beyond the detection. As a result, the
data breach issue persisted and caused significant losses.
To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of SOCs, it is imper-
ative for the security community to identify problems facing SOCs
and create solutions to fortify these critical components against the
ever-growing number of attacks. Unfortunately, little research has
been done to investigate the issues faced by SOCs. Previous work fo-
cused on analyst efficiency [2] and burnout [43] in SOCs, but there
is a lack of research that comprehensively studies what issues exist
in SOCs. This shortage renders the academic community unaware
of practical problems and struggles that SOCs must contend with,
leaving them ill-positioned to address these significant challenges.
In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to discover the
issues of SOCs. In contrast to quantitative research, qualitative
research focuses on meanings, concepts definitions, characteristics,
metaphors, symbols, and descriptions of things [29], which is aligned
with our goal of studying what the issues are in current SOCs.
This research is based upon a one-year study with a total of
42,895-word transcripts of interviews with security practitioners in
various SOCs. In this study, we invited 57 SOC employees—both
managers and analysts—across 46 companies to participate, and 18
of them agreed to participate in a 45-minute in-depth interview to
discuss their understanding and concern of their SOC. We audio-
recorded, transcribed, anonymized, and analyzed all the interviews
by applying the iterative open coding approach [42].
We analyze the issues that analysts and managers reported and,
interestingly, found both agreements and contradictions among
them. In our analysis, we highlight the research problems that the
academic community should address to benefit SOCs in dealing
with real-world security threats. Based on the study, we have key
findings as follows:
Low visibility into the network infrastructure and end-
points is the most common issue in SOCs. Among all of the
issues that SOC operators identified (Section 2), low visibility into
the network infrastructure and endpoints is the most acknowl-
edged issue that prevents SOCs from being effective. The partici-
pants reported that low visibility is their biggest concern in security
operations (Section 4.1.1).
Phishing attacks are the most common attacks faced by
SOCs, yet current phishing defense training provides little
help in resolving the issue. In the interviews, 15 out of 18 partic-
ipants mentioned that phishing the attack experienced most often.
One possible way to prevent phishing attacks is to educate employ-
ees to be alert of suspicious emails. However, we found that such
education is not as effective as we expect in practice. In particular,
one participant mentioned his experience where a severe phishing
attack took place on an employee within 30 days after the phishing
defense training (Section 4.1.2).
False positives in malicious activity detection do not ma-
jorly impact SOC operations. Five interviewees reflected their
significant concerns regarding having a large volume of unfiltered,
unrelated, and uncorrelated alert data (Section 4.1.3). Moreover,
reports and logs that are automatically generated by SOC systems
may contain inaccurate or ambiguous information, which affects
SOC performance (Section 4.1.4). However, none of the intervie-
wees consider false positives in automatic malicious activity detec-
tion as a major issue in SOC operations, which is in opposition to
academia’s belief that false positives are fatal in automatic detection
(Section 4.1.5).
Current SOC performance evaluation metrics are ineffec-
tive in measuring SOC success. Current quantitative metrics,
such as the number of incidents and average response time, are not
effective in measuring SOC success because each security event
has unique severity and consequences (Section 4.2.2).
Speed of response and level of automation, evaluation met-
rics, and tool functionality are the top three controversial is-
sues between analysts and managers. Through our qualitative
analysis of our interview data, we discovered inherent disagree-
ments between managers and analysts regarding issues facing their
SOC (Section 4.2). Analysts and managers have conflicted and mis-
matched perspectives toward these issues.
Based on our findings, we provide actionable advice for SOC pro-
fessionals to help them improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
their organization’s SOC. Furthermore, we derive research opportu-
nities for the academic research community to help them recognize
the real-world concerns and needs of SOCs.
2 BACKGROUND
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a group dedicated to pre-
venting, detecting, and responding to the security incidents in an
organization. In contrast to Network Operation Centers that op-
erate and maintain the network equipment, or physical security
departments that are responsible for physical surveillance and secu-
rity of organizations, a SOC is responsible for monitoring, assessing,
and defending an organization’s computing environment by us-
ing a collection of tools, technologies, and processes. A SOC may
have a different name, such as Cyber Security Operations Center
(CSOC), Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), and
Information Security Operations Center (ISOC) [55]. In this paper,
we will refer to all such defense groups as SOCs.
Managers and analysts within a SOC collaborate to mitigate
the security threats in an organization. An organization typically
consists of networks, servers, databases, websites, applications, and
endpoints. A SOC analyzes activity over all the different units in
the organizational architecture to identify compromises.
Organization Resources. In this study, we consider two types
of SOCs: internal and outsourced. An internal SOC is part of the
organization they defend: it is operated and managed internally by
the organization. An outsourced SOC is an independent party which
an organization pays for SOC services. These SOCs are operated
and managed by an independent party, and typically report to a
designated entity who is a member of their client’s organization.
Human Hierarchy. One of the major tasks of a SOC is to consume
and analyze incident-relevant data. These incidents are events ob-
served on the company network and its endpoints, which may
require further actions. A SOC collects, analyzes, and stores very
large volumes of data daily from logging mechanisms. For instance,
intrusion detection systems, which generate logs, are placed on the
network to capture potentially malicious activities and to provide
information regarding that activity to SOC analysts. SOCs dedi-
cate a group of individuals that perform real-time triage of these
received alerts, logs, and events on their network.
This group of system analysts is called Tier 1. Some of the addi-
tional responsibilities of Tier 1 analysts include real-time monitor-
ing and configuring system tools. They perform the initial inves-
tigation of the incident, and if the incident is out of the scope of
their responsibility or if their skill-set is not enough to investigate
that incident, they escalate it to the next tier (the Tier 2 analysts).
The Tier 2 analysts perform an in-depth analysis of the incident.
They review the Tier 1 analyst’s reports to identify affected systems
and the scope of the attack. Based on the collected evidence, Tier 2
analysts take actions such as blocking an activity, deactivating an
account, watching the network for further evidence, or escalating
the case to a higher-tier.
In general, as the tier level increases, the responsibilities of the
analysts become more specific. Moreover, the time expectancy of
solving incidents of each tier tends to differ, where analysts from a
lower-tier are expected to resolve incidents faster than a higher-tier,
as incidents that escalate are more complex.

Table 1: Participants in our research study.
In the second step, to recruit the corresponding SOC manager/-
analyst from the same organization, we used the Snowball Sampling
technique, which is used to recruit future subjects by referrals from
existing subjects [6]. We asked each participant to ask if their man-
ager or their analyst would be interested in participating in our
research study. In this way, we recruited an additional six partici-
pants.
As shown in Table 1, we recruited 5 participants who work in
an outsourced SOC and 13 participants who work in internal SOCs.
Due to ethical considerations, we do not provide any identifiers that
would potentially reveal manager/analyst pairs who work in the
same organization, including their corresponding industry sectors.
Interview Question Design. Our interviews included questions
that were specific to roles. On specific topics, we designed questions
that were only asked to managers. We selected these topics by
considering role-specific authorizations and responsibilities. For
example, we asked questions about integrating new technologies
to managers because, typically, a manager can decide to add new
technology to the SOC. Similarly, SOC budget is typically controlled
by an entity who is situated either the equivalent of or higher than a
manager in the organizational hierarchy. Because of this reason, we
asked questions that are related to budget to managers. Regarding
automation, we designed questions for analysts. We wanted to
understand if analysts were allowed to automate their systems and
their opinion on automation.
At the start of each interview, the interviewer mentioned that all
questions were optional, and participants were free not to respond
to any of them. It is worth noting that the interviewer did not ask
questions in the order they appear in the Appendix A; the discussion
flow with the participant determined the order of the questions and
the interviewer had discretion to follow leads [4].
Data Analysis. We adopted the iterative open coding procedure [42]
to analyze our interview data thoroughly. Two independent coders
coded all interviews to ensure unbiased results. The primary re-
searcher conducted and transcribed the interviews.
After finalizing the interviews and the transcriptions, the pri-
mary researcher created a codebook by coding the transcripts. Once
the codebook was complete, the second coder joined the research
Figure 1: Typical SOC analyst tier responsibilities [55].
In large organizations, there may be other tiers that perform
tasks such as threat hunting, vulnerability assessment, and penetra-
tion testing. Broadly, these tier layers are called Tier 3+. A graphical
representation of the tiers with their responsibilities is shown in
Figure 1. It is important to note that not all SOC have such a hier-
archical structure. In non-hierarchical arrangements, all employees
are expected to have similar skill-sets which makes them capable
of handling incidents individually.
3 METHODOLOGY
We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with SOC analysts
and managers from six different industry sectors: airline, construc-
tion, education, financial services, information technology, and
professional services. The interview questions cover topics such
as the SOC types, the hierarchical structures, the technical and
managerial operations, and the evaluation metrics. For the details
of the interview questions, please refer to Appendix A. To have
exhaustive results, we did not stop conducting interviews until new
themes stopped emerging from the iterative open coding procedure
