## Abstract
Organizations, such as companies and governments, have established Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to defend against computer security attacks. SOCs are central defense units that focus on security incident management, including monitoring, prevention, response, and reporting. Despite their critical importance, only a few research studies have focused on the specific issues faced by SOCs. In this study, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with SOC analysts and managers from various industry sectors. Through our analysis of the interview data, we identified both technical and non-technical issues in SOCs. Additionally, we found inherent disagreements between SOC managers and analysts that, if not addressed, could pose a risk to SOC efficiency and effectiveness. We distill these issues into actionable takeaways for both future academic research and SOC management. Our findings highlight the need for research to focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SOCs.

## 1. Introduction
Computer security attacks pose a significant threat to organizations, often resulting in severe consequences for the organization, its clients, and partners. To mitigate these threats, many organizations have established Security Operations Centers (SOCs). These centers are typically composed of security specialists who monitor, prevent, report, and respond to security incidents. While SOCs have been shown to improve an organization's security posture, serious security incidents remain frequent, indicating that the current SOC setup is insufficient.

The reasons for SOC failures are multifaceted, involving both technical and human-centric issues. For example, in 2013, Target suffered a data breach despite deploying a $1.6 million malware detection tool and enforcing reasonable security controls. The subsidiary SOC detected the issue and reported it to the main SOC, but the main SOC did not take further action, leading to significant losses.

To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of SOCs, it is essential to identify and address the issues they face. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on the problems encountered by SOCs. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting a qualitative study to discover the issues in SOCs. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with SOC analysts and managers from various organizations and analyzed the data using an iterative open coding approach. Our findings provide actionable advice for SOC professionals and highlight research opportunities for the academic community.

## 2. Background
### 2.1. Security Operations Center (SOC)
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a dedicated group responsible for preventing, detecting, and responding to security incidents within an organization. Unlike Network Operation Centers, which manage network equipment, or physical security departments, which handle physical surveillance, a SOC focuses on monitoring, assessing, and defending an organization's computing environment. SOCs may be known by different names, such as Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC), Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), or Information Security Operations Center (ISOC).

### 2.2. Organization Resources
In this study, we consider two types of SOCs: internal and outsourced. An internal SOC is part of the organization it defends and is managed internally. An outsourced SOC is an independent party that provides SOC services to the organization and reports to a designated entity within the client's organization.

### 2.3. Human Hierarchy
SOCs analyze large volumes of data daily from logging mechanisms, such as intrusion detection systems. They typically have a tiered structure, with Tier 1 analysts performing real-time triage of alerts, logs, and events. If an incident is beyond their scope or skill set, it is escalated to Tier 2 analysts, who perform in-depth analysis and take appropriate actions. In some organizations, there may be additional tiers (Tier 3+) for tasks like threat hunting, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing.

## 3. Methodology
We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with SOC analysts and managers from six different industry sectors: airline, construction, education, financial services, information technology, and professional services. The interview questions covered topics such as SOC types, hierarchical structures, technical and managerial operations, and evaluation metrics. For the detailed interview questions, please refer to Appendix A. We continued conducting interviews until no new themes emerged from the iterative open coding procedure.

## 4. Key Findings
### 4.1. Common Issues in SOCs
- **Low Visibility**: The most common issue in SOCs is low visibility into the network infrastructure and endpoints, which hinders their effectiveness.
- **Phishing Attacks**: Phishing attacks are the most frequently encountered, yet current phishing defense training is not as effective as expected.
- **False Positives**: False positives in malicious activity detection do not significantly impact SOC operations, contrary to academic beliefs.
- **Inaccurate Reports**: Automatically generated reports and logs may contain inaccurate or ambiguous information, affecting SOC performance.

### 4.2. Disagreements Between Managers and Analysts
- **Speed of Response and Automation**: There are inherent disagreements between managers and analysts regarding the speed of response and the level of automation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Current quantitative metrics, such as the number of incidents and average response time, are ineffective in measuring SOC success.
- **Tool Functionality**: Managers and analysts have conflicting views on the functionality of SOC tools.

## 5. Conclusion
Based on our findings, we provide actionable advice for SOC professionals to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their SOCs. We also derive research opportunities for the academic community to address the real-world concerns and needs of SOCs. Future research should focus on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of SOCs by addressing the identified issues and resolving the inherent disagreements between managers and analysts.
