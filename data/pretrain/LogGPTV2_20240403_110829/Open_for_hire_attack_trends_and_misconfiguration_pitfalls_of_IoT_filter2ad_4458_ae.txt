### IoT Tagging and Analysis of Attack Sources

We assigned an "IoT" tag to IP addresses identified as IoT devices through periodic, Internet-wide scans. From the Censys database, we identified an additional 16,713 IoT devices. Further analysis revealed that the majority of attacks originated from cameras, routers, and IP phones.

### Non-IoT Infected Hosts

To extend our search for attacks from non-IoT devices, we performed a reverse lookup on all source IP addresses. This process uncovered 797 registered domains, of which 427 had active webpages. We examined these domains to determine if they served additional IP addresses beyond those discovered in our initial analysis. Our findings indicated that some domains were registered with /30 and /29 subnets, containing unused IP addresses. Additionally, we inferred that some Telnet malware injections originated from infected URLs serving HTML. Upon checking these URLs on VirusTotal, we found that 346 were tagged as malicious. The webpages included default WordPress sites, Ubuntu Apache test pages, static ad pages, and fake online shopping portals.

### Multistage Attacks on Honeypots

We define multistage attacks as those involving a sequence of multiple protocols targeted by the same adversary. Such strategies can be used to amplify attacks or find alternative sources for malware injection. To filter out scanning services, we used the Exonerator service [52], identifying 151 unique IPs originating from Tor relays. We observed a daily recurring pattern of scans from these sources, with an increasing trend over the month.

### Summary of Attack Trends

For April 2021, we summarized the attack trends for each protocol emulated by the honeypots (Figure 7). UDP protocols (CoAP and UPnP) received higher traffic related to Denial of Service compared to TCP protocols. TCP protocols, on the other hand, saw an increase in malware deployment and data poisoning. Our simulated IoT environment suggests an increasing number of attacks targeting misconfigured IoT devices.

### Impact of Scanning Services

The honeypots received numerous requests from known scanning services, such as Shodan, BinaryEdge, and ZoomEye (Figure 3). After being listed on these services, we observed an increase in the number of attacks on the honeypots (Figure 8). The figure also highlights major DoS attacks on specific days (Day 24, 26), showing an upward trend in attacks post-listing.

### Attacks from Infected Hosts

From the results of the honeypots and the network telescope, we observed a significant number of attacks from unknown sources, many of which involved malware injections. To identify attack sources from infected IoT devices, we used domain lookups and checked for affiliations with scanning services. The HosTaGe honeypot detected multistage attacks, while for other honeypots, we grouped attacks based on source IP addresses, without considering the time interval between attacks.

### Conclusion

Our work combines the search for misconfigured IoT devices on the Internet with an analysis of attack trends. We are the first to integrate the results of a complete IPv4 scan with insights from honeypot deployment and network telescope data. Our scans revealed a large number of misconfigured IoT devices that can be leveraged for various types of attacks. The attacks on the honeypots indicate a trend of attackers searching for vulnerable IoT devices, supported by network telescope data. We identified 11,118 misconfigured IoT systems actively attacking the Internet, with 1.8 million devices potentially waiting to be exploited.

### Future Work

We plan to extend our scanning scope to include TR069, SMB, and industrial IoT protocols like DDS and OPC UA. Additionally, we aim to perform a deeper analysis of raw packet data to uncover new threat actors in Industrial IoT devices and protocols. Based on recent work by Wan et al. [96], we see the need for combining geographically distributed scanners, especially for certain protocols like SSH.
