an "iot" tag if the IP address was identified as an IoT device from its
periodic Internet-wide scans. We identify an additional 1, 6713 IoT
devices from the Censys database. A further analysis to determine
the type of these IoT devices reveals that the majority of the attacks
originate from cameras, routers and IP phones.
Lastly, we extend the search for attacks from infected hosts from
non-IoT devices. Upon performing a simple reverse lookup of all the
source IP addresses, we discover a total of 797 registered domains
of which 427 have a webpage. The domains were looked up to see
if they served additional on additional IP addresses than the one
discovered from our analysis. We found the domains registered
with /30 and /29 subnets with some unused IP addresses. From this
analysis, we also infer that some of the Telnet malware injections
originated from an infected URL serving HTML. Upon searching
Virustotal for these URLs, we find 346 of them tagged as malicious.
The webpages were found serving default wordpress sites, Ubuntu
Apache test pages, static ad pages and fake online shopping portals.
Figure 9: Multistage attacks detected on honeypots
5.4 Multistage attacks in honeypots
We define multistage attacks as attacks in which there is a pattern of
multiple protocols that are being sequentially attacked by the same
adversary. Attackers may employ the multistage attack strategy to
amplify an attack or to find alternate sources for malware injection.
Although such types of traffic may be observed from scanning
services, we filter such sources by checking if they are registered to
2In more details, 1, 147 attacked only the honeypots, 1, 274 attacked only the telescope,
and 8, 697 both of them.
3In particular, 439 attacked only the honeypots, 564 attacked only the telescope, and
668 both of them.

attack sources with the Exonerator service [52] we determine a
total of 151 unique IPs originating from Tor relays. Furthermore,
we observe a daily recurring pattern of scans from these sources
and an increasing trend over the month.
5.1.7
Summary. We summarize the attack trends for each pro-
tocol emulated by the honeypots for April 2021 in Figure 7. We
observe that UDP protocols (CoAP and UPnP) received higher traf-
fic related to Denial of Service in comparison to TCP protocols.
Furthermore, the TCP protocols have seen an increase in malware
deployment and data poisoning. Our simulated IoT environment
suggests that there is an increasing number of attacks concentrating
on misusing misconfigured IoT devices.
5.2 Impact of listing by scanning-services
The honeypots received many requests from known scanning-
services as listed in Figure 3. We observed an increase in the number
of attacks on the honeypots after their listing on scanning-services
like Shodan, BinaryEdge and ZoomEye. Figure 8 shows the total
number of attacks on the honeypots by day. The attacks include all
the requests from scanning-services and other malicious sources.
The attacks are distinct by the connection sessions established from
the source. The dates at which scanning-services listed the honey-
pots are also marked in the figure. Furthermore, the figure shows
the days on which some major DoS attacks occurred (Day 24, 26).
We observe an upward trend in the number of attacks after being
listed by scanning-services.
5.3 Attacks from infected hosts
From the results of the honeypots and the network telescope, we
observe that there is a large number of attacks originating from
unknown sources. Furthermore, from the attack trends, we observe
many attempts of malware injections from unknown sources. To
determine attack sources originating from infected IoT devices,

a domain affiliated to a scanning service. The HosTaGe honeypot
offers the detection of multistage attacks as a service. For the other
honeypots, we group the attacks from distinct source IP addresses
and check if multiple protocols are targeted. We note that the attacks
are grouped based on the source IP addresses and the time interval
between attacks is not taken into account. This entails that a follow
up attack from the same adversary may have occurred anytime in
the one month experiment period.
We list the protocols targeted by attackers in the identified mul-
tistage attacks across the honeypots in Figure 9. The figure depicts
the protocols targeted step-wise. The numbers below the protocol
indicate the total number of attacks received on that protocol at
that stage and the thickness of the bars indicate the amplitude of
the attacks. A total of 267 multistage attacks were detected and we
observe that the majority of them initiated with Telnet and SSH.
Furthermore, the SMB is noticed to be receiving most of the attacks
at the second step and the S7 protocol in step three.
6 CONCLUSION
With this work, we combine the search for misconfigured IoT de-
vices on the Internet with an analysis of attack trends in the IoT.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to combine the
results of a complete IPv4 scan with knowledge gained by honeypot
deployment and network telescope data. Beyond the large number
of attacks that we received and analyzed, we show that many of
the misconfigured devices take themselves the role of the attacker
as part of malware propagation campaigns.
In particular, our scans reveal that there is a large number of
misconfigured IoT devices that can be leveraged to perform diverse
type of attacks on the Internet. Furthermore, the attacks received on
the honeypots suggest a trend in attackers searching for vulnerable
IoT devices. This is supported by the network telescope data that
suggest a global trend. The attacks received from infected IoT hosts
show that high magnitude attacks are possible, specifically with
devices running CoAP and UPnP. Through this work, we aim at
creating awareness about the implications of the misconfigurations
of IoT devices by exploring such devices that are making us of six
popular protocols. In fact, it is worth noting that by intersecting
all of our experiments (IPv4 scanning, network telescope and hon-
eypots) we are able to identify 11, 118 misconfigured IoT systems
that are actively attacking the Internet; simultaneously 1.8 million
devices are potentially waiting to be exploited by adversaries.
In comparison to previous work on Internet-wide scanning
[50, 74], we use custom probes that scan for specific IoT protocols
and further use open datasets to verify our findings from the scan.
We identify a large of number of misconfigured IoT devices based
on specific banner-based and response-based indicators. While
Markowsky et al. [50] demonstrate how to scan and find vulnerable
devices using Shodan and Masscan, they do not specifically search
for misconfigured IoT devices. Our results confirm the methodol-
ogy of [74], which combines scanning the Internet and deploying
honeypots to study the attack trends on the FTP protocol. We in-
stead focus on 6 protocols that are used in IoT. We enhance our
methodology by using the data from a network telescope as with
Neshenko st al. [57], who use the data to support their proposed
taxonomy of IoT vulnerabilities. Furthermore, our work highlights
206
the need for sanitization of Internet-scan data from honeypots. In
this context, we identify 8,192 honeypots that would otherwise be
classified as misconfigured IoT systems. While individual work on
honeypot fingerprinting has shed light into this field [75, 92], no
previous work on the Internet measurements has taken honeypots
into account.
To summarize our contributions, we scan the Internet, specifi-
cally to find misconfigured IoT devices by the use of custom probes
on 6 protocols (TCP and UDP). We verify the results from our scan
by validating them with open datasets on Internet-scanning. We
filter out potential honeypots from our scanning results by using
our multistage honeypot fingerprinting techniques [75] to avoid
poisoning of the results. Lastly, we deploy 6 IoT honeypots that
emulate misconfigurations observed from IoT devices in our scan.
Furthermore, the analysis of the data from the telescope compli-
ments our observations on the attacks received on honeypots.
With regard to future work, we plan to extend the scanning scope
of protocols to include TR069, SMB, and industrial IoT protocols
like DDS and OPC UA. The analysis from the network telescope
also motivates us to perform a deeper analysis on raw packet data to
uncover new threat actors on Industrial IoT devices and protocols.
Lastly, based on the recent work of Wan et al. [96] we see the need
for combining geographically distributed scanners, especially for
certain protocols (e.g. SSH).
