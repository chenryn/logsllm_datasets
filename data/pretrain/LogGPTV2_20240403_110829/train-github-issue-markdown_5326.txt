  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
There should be no error
## Current Behavior
The following error happens:
> Menu.js:535 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'props' of undefined  
>  at Object.handleClickAway [as onClickAway] (Menu.js:535)  
>  at HTMLDocument.ClickAwayListener._this.handleClickAway
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Provide SelectField an empty array [] as child instead of array of MenuItem's.
  2. Open this SelectField's dropdown. Empty dropdown is shown as there are no items to select.
  3. Click away to close the dropdown. Error will appear in the console.
(the same happens if I provide undefined instead of empty array)
## Context
Perhaps it is intended I provide at least one MenuItem in the child array but
empty array should be valid also as I don't want items in the dropdown in my
context.
