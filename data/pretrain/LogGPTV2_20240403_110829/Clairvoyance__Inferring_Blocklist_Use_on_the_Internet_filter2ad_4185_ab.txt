Further, to obtain a deﬁnitive signal from our experiment, we need to adhere to
the following constraints when sampling blocklist IPs to avoid possible noise:
– Exclusive: A blocklist can share part of its contents with other blocklists.
To reasonably infer whether a reﬂector is using a speciﬁc blocklist, we need
to test with IPs unique to that blocklist—IPs that are only in this blocklist
but no others.
– Stable: IPs on a blocklist change over time. To reliably measure if a reﬂector
blocks IPs from a certain blocklist, we need the sampled IPs to stay in the
list throughout one experiment. This cannot be enforced beforehand, so we
discard the cases where a blocklist IP does not remain on the list for the
duration of the experiment.
– Routable: IP blocklists can contain unroutable IPs [23]. Sending packets
with an unroutable source address results in a large portion of packets being
dropped, as we have observed (which could potentially happen at end ISPs
or transient links). Packet drops due to unroutable IPs would create noise in
the experiment. Therefore, when sampling IPs from blocklists we ensure that
the IPs are routable.
– Geo-location diversiﬁed: Besides blocklisting, another common reason for
traﬃc blocking is geo-blocking, where a host blocks all traﬃc coming from a
certain country or region. To minimize the eﬀect of geo-blocking, we prioritize
IPs that are from the United States when sampling IPs, assuming a host in
the US will not geo-block traﬃc from the US. For IPs in other countries, we
try to increase the diversity of IP locations, making sure the sampled IPs are
not concentrated in only a few countries when possible.

– Not from reﬂectors’ network (AS disjoint): We observed that not many
networks have implemented ingress ﬁltering (we saw less than 2% of the
total hosts we scanned showing this behavior). However, many networks drop
spoofed packets when the spoofed source addresses are within their own net-
work. So when selecting blocklist IPs, we make sure that these IPs are not
from the same ASes as one of our reﬂectors.
3.4 Control Group
To further validate our technique, every time we test a set of blocklist IPs against
each reﬂector, we also include a control group of 20 randomly chosen IPs that
are BGP routable, geo-located in the United States and not blocklisted (see
Sect. 4.2). The control group represents a random set of IPs that are unlikely to
be blocked in bulk by a reﬂector. We use US IPs to avoid the potential problem
of geo-blocking. If a reﬂector does block a signiﬁcant fraction of control IPs, it is
probably because the reﬂector is not suitable for this technique (one reason can
be that our ingress-ﬁltering step did not catch these IPs), and we should discard
all the results associated with this reﬂector.
3.5 Ethical Considerations
In our experiments, we send spoofed packets to reﬂectors impersonating traﬃc
from other IPs to infer the presence of network-layer blocking based on IP block-
lists. A key ethical concern with this kind of measurement is the extent to which
either receiving such packets or being seen to have received such packets would
put the recipients at undue risk. Indeed, this is particularly problematic in cen-
sorship measurements [11,29] because of the potential to inadvertently cause a
host to be associated with content that is politically dangerous in their country.
However, our work operates in a context that is substantially less risky, and we
have further designed multiple aspects of our protocol to minimize the likelihood
of risk. In particular, our methodology incorporates the following approaches to
minimize risk:
Restriction in Scope: We have speciﬁcally restricted our measurements to only
reﬂectors within the United States, which aﬀords relatively robust free speech
rights and considerable transparency around criminal proceedings. Indeed, from
our conversations with both network operators and law enforcement, we are
unaware of a realistic scenario where the mere receipt of a packet has led to
criminal or civil liability.
Conventional Sources: Unlike in censorship studies, the source IP addresses
being spoofed in our measurement are those that have been used to mount
wide-spread abusive activity such as spamming, port scanning, etc. and these
represent precisely the kinds of traﬃc that a typical host on the Internet would
expect to receive.
Inbound, Connection-Free Probes: Our measurements are constructed to
be inbound only and connection free; that is, a network monitor could witness
64
V. G. Li et al.
traﬃc consistent with an external scan of one of their hosts, but will never
witness a completed connection or any data transmission. From our discussions
with network operators and network security vendors, we could not identify a
scenario where the mere receipt of the packets we send would be suﬃcient to
drive an incident response team to action.
Minimal Use of End-Host Resources: Our scans are purposely constructed
with SYN-ACK packets to ensure that no state is created on the reﬂector. More-
over, our peak probing rate per reﬂector is 6 min-sized packets per second (see
appendix for more details). But even that rate only persists for two seconds in
each test, and in the following pilot study, we probe each reﬂector no more than
once every 3 mins.
4 Pilot Study Implementation
With the technique discussed in the previous section, one can then infer if an
online host (reﬂector) satisfying the selection criteria outlined above is block-
ing traﬃc using a speciﬁc IP blocklist. To evaluate our inference technique, we
conducted a pilot study over a large number of reﬂectors to infer their blocklist
usage. In this section, we explain in detail the implementation of our experiment,
including reﬂector selection, blocklist selection, sampling IPs from blocklists and
measurement setup.
4.1 Reﬂector Selection
We start our selection of reﬂectors using a snapshot of Censys [9] scanning data
from November 8, 2019, consisting of over 40 million IPv4 hosts with open ports
in the US. We then send multiple probes to each host targeting an open port
from diﬀerent source addresses, checking the IP IDs of responses to identify the
ones with the IP ID side channel. We further run tests to make sure they meet
the criteria listed in Sect. 3.2 (see Appendix A). If one host has multiple open
ports, we randomly pick one to probe.

65
reﬂector. Table 1 counts these addresses at diﬀerent network aggregations. By
construction, the set of reﬂectors we use will necessarily have certain biases. To
understand what fraction of networks of potential interest to others this might
cover, we queried the Alexa top 100K domains as of Dec. 17th, 2019 for their
A records and MX records and obtained their corresponding IP addresses. Of
these, we identiﬁed a total of 94,846 IPs that are located in the US, covering
34,083 /24 s. While we made no attempt to ﬁnd reﬂectors in these networks
a priori, our selection methodology identiﬁed at least one reﬂector in 16.9% of
these /24 s. When only looking at the top 10K domains, our data set covers
13.2% of US /24 s.
We also checked the WHOIS record of each reﬂector and identiﬁed all hosts
associated with education institutions. In total, our data set includes 4,370 edu-
cation IPs, ranging across 181 diﬀerent institutions, and covers 40 out of the top
100 US universities based on the US News ranking [42]. Thus, while there may
be networks without a suitable reﬂector for one reason or another, our technique
is applicable to a large number of existing networks.
4.2 Choosing Blocklists and Sampling IPs
For the pilot study, we choose candidate blocklists from public IPv4 blocklists.
We use the FireHOL IP blocklist collection [12], which aggregates over 100 pub-
lic IP blocklists every day. However, we cannot reasonably test against all the
blocklists and so, for the purposes of this paper, we select the most popular
public IP blocklists and then do a more detailed measurement on them.
For each of the public IP blocklists, we sample ﬁve IPs (using the criteria in
Sect. 3.3) from each list and test how many reﬂectors block all sampled blocklist
IPs in each blocklist. The goal of this step is to roughly estimate how widely
used these blocklists might be, so that we can pick the most prevalent ones for
more detailed measurements later in Sect. 5. We repeat the measurement twice
and select the top 9 blocklists:
1. Spamhaus DROP: Spamhaus Don’t Route Or Peer Lists
2. Spamhaus EDROP: An extension of the Spamhaus DROP list
3. DShield Top Blocklist: DShield.org recommended top 20 /24 s to block
4. ET Compromised: EmergingThreats.net recorded compromised hosts
5. Snort IP Filter List:
6. BDS IP Ban List: Binary Defense System ban list
7. Feodo IP Blocklist: Abuse.ch Feodo tracking list
8. Blocklist De Blocklist: Blocklist.de blocklist IPs
9. Tor IP Blocklist: IPs that belong to the Tor network (not just exit nodes)
labs.snort.org supplied IP blocklist
When sampling IPs from blocklists to test, we use the criteria listed in
Sect. 3.3. To ﬁnd the exclusive IPs on each blocklist, we use the public IP block-
lists collected by FireHOL, as mentioned earlier, and calculate the unique part
of each target blocklist. For the stable IP requirement, we collect all the target
blocklists hourly, and ensure the sampled IPs are in the blocklist through the
66
V. G. Li et al.
duration of the experiment. To satisfy the routable requirement, we use daily
RouteView data [41] to identify BGP routable IPs. For geo-location diversity,
we use NetAcuity [26] to make sure for each experiment the sampled IPs cover
as many diﬀerent countries as the data allows.
4.3 Measurement Setup
Having selected the reﬂectors and blocklists, we can now conduct the experiment
to infer which reﬂectors use which speciﬁc blocklist.
For a particular experimental run, we randomly selected 25 IPs from each
blocklist that satisfy the requirements deﬁned in Sect. 3: exclusive, stable,
routable, geo-diversiﬁed, and AS disjoint. Then we evaluated the blocking behav-
ior for all 220K reﬂectors against the 225 blocklist IPs sampled from the 9 block-
lists. To handle cases where reﬂectors might take time to update and start block-
ing the newest IPs on the blocklist, we ensure the sampled IPs have appeared in
the blocklist at least 2 weeks before our experiment. During post-processing, we
remove blocklist IPs from consideration that did not remain on the list for the
duration of the experiment. Furthermore, we conducted three experimental runs,
each time using a diﬀerent set of 25 IPs from each blocklist. We then conclude
that a reﬂector is using a blocklist if and only if all experiment runs show that
it blocked all the sampled IPs from that blocklist.
We conducted our measurements from December 3–23rd, 2019. During this
period, we tested in total 96,067,051 distinct (reflector, blocklist IP) pairs.
(In the ﬁrst two experiments, we tested against all reﬂectors. In the last exper-
iment, we only tested the ones that have shown blocking behavior in the ﬁrst
two tests.) Among these pairs, 894,570 pairs display a clear signal indicating
“blocking”.
5 Pilot Study Overall Results
Use at least one blocklist (1.9%)
Block at least
one IP (21.2%)
No blocking observed (76.9%)
Fig. 2. Breakdown of reﬂector blocking based on three experimental runs. We identiﬁed
4,253 reﬂectors that use at least one blocklist (Sect. 5.1). We also found a large number
of reﬂectors blocking at least some IPs in blocklists (Sect. 5.2).
Figure 2 presents the overall blocking behavior of all 222,782 reﬂectors we tested
partitioned into four categories: those reﬂectors that we conclude use at least
one of the public blocklists (1.9%), reﬂectors that block at least one blocklist IP
Clairvoyance: Inferring Blocklist Use on the Internet

(21.2%), and reﬂectors that do not block any blocklist IPs (76.9%). Note that
given the attributes of hosts to be reﬂectors, such as running old OS versions, it
is not surprising a large percentage shows no blocking of the blocklist IPs: they
already have attributes anti-correlated with high degrees of security hygiene. The
following sections explores each of these categories of reﬂector blocking behavior
in more detail.
