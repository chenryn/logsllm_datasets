User: How to adjust the file descriptor limit of Linux system?
Assistant: In a Linux system, each process has a maximum number of file descriptors supported, which is usually limited to a small default value, which can be adjusted in the following ways: 1. Query the current file descriptor limit Use the `ulimit -a` command to list the current system limit information, including the maximum limit value of the file descriptor. 2. Use commands to modify the current file descriptor limit Use the ulimit command to modify the current file descriptor limit, for example: ``` ulimit -n 65535 ``` The above command sets the file descriptor limit value to 65535. 3. Permanently modify the file descriptor limit If you want to permanently modify the file descriptor limit value, you usually need to edit the `/etc/security/limits.conf` file on Linux systems and add the following line: ``` * soft nofile 65535 * hard nofile 65535 ``` The above configuration specifies that all users (*) have a 65535 file descriptor limit on both soft and hard limits. For the restrictions to take effect, the changes must be applied by restarting the system or by logging back in.
