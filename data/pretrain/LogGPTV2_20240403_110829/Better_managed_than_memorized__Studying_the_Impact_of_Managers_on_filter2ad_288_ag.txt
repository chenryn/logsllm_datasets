B Zxcvbn Score
To better understand zxcvbn’s scoring, we used zxcvbn
to score 200 million unique passwords collected from
hashes.org, where we measured the zxcvbn score and
the corresponding guesses in log10. The results in Ta-
ble 9 show that each score has a corresponding cutoff for
guesses, e.g., score 2 requires between 103–106 guesses.

C Website category vs. website value
Commonly the website category is used as a proxy for the
website value. Since we collected both, we can provide
insights into this general assumption. Figure 8 shows the
self-reported value per domain. For instance, in>70% of
a very high value for that domain. Similarly, in>60% of a
logged passwords for a ﬁnancial domain, the user reported
logged passwords for news websites, the users (strongly)
disagreed that this domain has a high value.
D Known Password Manager Plugins
Chrome plugins are identiﬁed through a 32 characters
long UUID that can be retrieved from Google’s Chrome
Web Store. Table 10 lists the password manager plugins
that our study plugin can detect based on their UUID.
Plugins not in this list are reported as "Unknown plugin."

E Demographics of participant groups
Table 11 presents the demographics of our two participant
groups according their password creation strategies.
F Model ﬁt
All models in the building process were compared ac-
cording to the corresponding akaike information criterion
(AIC), which is an estimator of the relative quality of
statistical models for a given set of data. Additionally, the
models were statistically compared using likelihood-ratio
tests, which were evaluated using a Chi-squared distribu-
tion. The ﬁnal model is selected based on AIC as well as
their ability to describe the empirical data better than the
previous models. Tables 12 and 13 present the goodness
of ﬁt for the relevant steps in the model building process.
