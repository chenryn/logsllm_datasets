Based upon services provided, it was determined that a remote attacker would be able
to penetrate CUSTOMER's defenses. The initial attacker vector is identified as critical,
because it can be discovered remotely through automated scanning. The impact from
exploiting such vulnerabilities could cripple CUSTOMER's network and brand.
Recommendations
We commend CUSTOMER for being proactive in managing technology risk and
network security through procuring our services. Due to the impact to the overall
organization as uncovered by this Penetration test, appropriate resources are
recommended to be allocated to ensure that remediation efforts are accomplished in
a timely manner. While a comprehensive list of items that should be implemented
is beyond the scope of this engagement, some high-level items are important to
mention:
• Implement a patch management program: Many identified vulnerabilities
could be avoided with proper patch management. We recommend following
the guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-408 as a source for developing
security policies for proper patch management. This will reduce the risk of
running vulnerable systems.
• Enforce change control across all systems: Common vulnerabilities are
caused by human error. Many misconfiguration issues could be avoided
through a strong change and control process on all active systems.
• Leverage multifactor and role-based access control: Some critical systems
were found leveraging password security as the only means of validating
authorized individuals. Best practice is having at least two forms of
authentication, along with limiting administration account access.
• Restrict access to critical systems: Critical systems should be isolated from
other systems using whitelists, ACLs, VLANs, and other means. The design
concept of least privilege will limit the amount of damage an attacker can
inflict using a compromised resource. Consult NIST SP 800-27 RevA11 for
guidelines on achieving a security baseline for IT systems.
Risk Rating
The overall risk identified by SERVICE PROVIDER for CUSTOMER is broken down
between Critical and Low, defined as follows. SERVICE PROVIDER identified
three critical vulnerabilities that were used to gain access to CUSTOMER's internal
network.
• Critical: Immediate threat to key business processes
• High: Indirect threat to key business processes/ threat to secondary business
processes

Chapter 8
• Medium: Indirect / partial threat to business processes
• Low: No direct threat exists; vulnerability may be leverage with other
vulnerabilities
The current risk level of systems tested, based on the highest risk level of findings
in systems is Critical during the testing, a total of three (3) Critical, two (2) Medium,
and two (2) Low vulnerabilities were identified.
Appendix: Vulnerability Detail with Mitigation
Summary
This chapter concluded this book by providing guidance for developing professional
customer deliverable reports post-Penetration Testing services. Breaking into
systems and other hands on technical work is fun; however, detailed reporting and
solid business practices pay the bills. What makes a professional service practices
successful is the ability to become a trusted advisor for their related field. For
security requirements, this means helping customers meet compliance regulations,
reduce risk from vulnerabilities, and improve how to identify threats.
The first topic covered was compliance, because that is a common method to show
value for procuring services. We find customers find budget when there is a risk
of not meeting a mandate or reacting to a recent incident, so knowing the most
popular standards will improve your ability to matter to your customers. Next, we
looked at different methods to bill for services, as well as some things to look out for
regarding quoting for a project. After that, we broke down the different components
of a deliverable document providing best practices for providing results to your
customers. We added a final section that covered some reporting tools available in
Kali Linux that could help generate information for your customer deliverables.
We really enjoyed writing this book and hope it helps you with your web application
Penetration Testing objectives. Thank you for reading.
