Question: Which of the following statements are true regarding the properties and functionalities of pseudorandom number generators (pRNGs)?
"A": "A secure pRNG is designed such that its output is computationally indistinguishable from true random bits to any observer who does not know the seed.",
"B": "The efficiency of a pRNG is compromised if it is limited to producing a fixed number of bits per truly random input, since more true randomness would be required frequently.",
"C": "A pRNG's internal state remains constant once initialized with the initial truly random seed.",
"D": "The 'Generate(n)' function of a pRNG cannot update the internal state while generating pseudorandom bits."
Answer: AB
