**Mitigation Recommendation:**
To mitigate the risk associated with this technique, consider disabling the `emond` service by removing its Launch Daemon plist file. This action will prevent the `emond` service from being automatically started and can help reduce the attack surface of your system.

**Steps to Disable `emond`:**
1. Identify the Launch Daemon plist file for `emond`. The file is typically located at `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist`.
2. Remove the plist file using the following command:
   ```sh
   sudo rm /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist
   ```
3. Verify that the `emond` service is no longer running:
   ```sh
   ps aux | grep emond
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively disable the `emond` service and enhance the security of your system.
