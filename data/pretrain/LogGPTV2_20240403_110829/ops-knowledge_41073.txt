I am currently developing a webpage using Django on my PC, which runs Windows 7. I need to test some pages on a tablet, and I was wondering if it is possible to access my local development server (localhost) from an Android tablet. Both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network at home.

I have read several discussions on Stack Overflow and other forums, but I haven't found a clear solution yet. My tablet is a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 running Android 4.0.4.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**Solution:**

To access your Django development server from your Android tablet, follow these steps:

1. **Find Your PC's IP Address:**
   - Open the Command Prompt on your Windows 7 PC.
   - Type `ipconfig` and press Enter.
   - Look for the IP address associated with your wireless adapter (e.g., `192.168.1.5`).

2. **Access the Server from Your Tablet:**
   - Ensure both your PC and tablet are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
   - Open a web browser on your tablet.
   - Type the IP address of your PC followed by `:8000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:8000`) into the address bar and press Enter.

This should allow you to view and test your Django pages on your tablet. If you encounter any issues, make sure that your firewall settings on the PC are not blocking the connection.
