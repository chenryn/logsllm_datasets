User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where are the user credentials stored when remember password is selected? Provided a user has chosen the remember me option while logged in last time into a web application,how does the web application server identifies the user next time when he logs in? The credentials are stored in cookies in the client side itself? That would make huge security issues right? Somebody please explain

Assistant: Usaually the user's browser stores some cookies with a random string identifying the user on the server. 
More secure variants of this additionally check other parameters as the browser version, OS of the user and approximate location.

Basically, if you visit a webpage like facebook with a cookie, you get authenticated only with the random string in the cookie. 

How this works:
If you log in, the server generates this random string and stores it in it's database (togehter with other identification parameters). Additionally it sends this string as a cookie to the user's browser, where it is stored and delivered to the page with every request.
So if there is a request with a random value, the server checks if it matches with the other identification parameters and - if so - accepts you as a logged in user.
