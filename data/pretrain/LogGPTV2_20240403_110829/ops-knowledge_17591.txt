User: Please explain what is HTTPS? How is it different from HTTP?
Assistant: HTTPS is a secure version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that provides encryption and authentication using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. HTTP is a protocol used to transmit information between a web server and a client. It is a stateless protocol. The transmitted content is in plain text and does not provide encryption protection. Therefore, HTTP communication is vulnerable to interception and attacks, and the identities of both communicating parties cannot be verified. In contrast, HTTPS can provide higher security and privacy protection. HTTPS uses encryption algorithms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data, and uses digital certificates to verify the identities of both parties in communication. This way, the client can determine whether the web server is who it claims to be, and data can be securely transmitted in communications between the client and server. Because HTTPS provides better security and information protection, many websites now use HTTPS to protect online transactions and user privacy.
