Separation of attacks
In fact, since Test 2 fails if there is any neighbor closer
than T2, solving the 1-nearest-neighbor problem for each
aircraft is sufﬁcient. Using the aforementioned data structures,
this can be accomplished at a complexity of O(log n) for each
aircraft [40], resulting in a global complexity of O(n · log n).
4) Complementary Design: We propose a complementary
design consisting of both tests in parallel. Table I contains
a comparison of the spooﬁng detection tests. While the ﬁrst
test based on the cross-check of Equation (5) is independent
of other ﬂights, the second test based on the comparison of
multiple aircraft of Equation (6) is independent of the MLAT
positioning and can thus tolerate bad MLAT performance
(e. g., when sensors have a bad geometric distribution leading
to high dilution of precision). Furthermore, the second test is
able to separate multiple spooﬁng attacks occurring at the same
time as there will be independent sets of coinciding aircraft.
The combination of both tests can overcome the pitfalls of the
other and we can achieve a more versatile and robust spooﬁng
detection.
C. GPS Spoofer Localization
After spooﬁng detection, Crowd-GPS-Sec aims at localizing
spoofer devices. This is the next step in tracing an attacker in
order to take appropriate action for shutting down an attack.
We present a novel localization approach to remotely pinpoint
such devices using already available ADS-B/Flarm reports
broadcasted by aircraft. We start by describing the high-level
idea and then detail on the functionality of the crowdsourced
localization system.
1) Localization Model: If a malicious device emits GPS
spooﬁng signals, aircraft within the effective range will broad-
cast spoofed positions as contained in their ADS-B/Flarm
reports. All aircraft that receive the same fake GPS signals
will report positions on the same track but timely shifted as a
result of the propagation delay from different distances to the
spooﬁng source [7]. In particular, at the same global time, the
aircraft have different synchronizations on the spooﬁng signals
based on how long it takes the signals to arrive at the aircraft’s
GPS receiver, i. e., aircraft that receive the fake signals earlier
are ahead on the spoofed track, whereas aircraft that are further
away from the spoofer receive the signals at a later point
in time and are thus behind on the track. We extract the
resulting position differences from the ADS-B/Flarm reports
and backtrace these deviations to the location of the spooﬁng
device.

GPS Spoofer
Fig. 8. Each relation forms a hyperboloid representing all points with the
same distance differences. For the shown 2D projection, we can construct
three distinct relations considering three different aircraft.
Our starting point
is the identiﬁcation of the currently
spoofed aircraft, which is the outcome of the GPS spooﬁng
detection module. For those identiﬁed aircraft, we forward
related information to the spoofer localization module. We
further require the actual aircraft positions ai, aj from MLAT
and the mutual distances di,j with i, j ∈ {spoofed aircraft}.
As next step, we put the aircraft distance into relation with
the propagation distances and the rate of position change, i. e.,
the spoofed track velocity. We can formulate this as follows:
dist(ai, SP) − dist(aj, SP) = di,j ·
c
vtrack
,
(7)
c
vtrack
where ai, aj indicate the actual position of aircraft i, j as given
by MLAT, SP is the unknown spoofer location, di,j the respec-
tive aircraft distance, and vtrack the velocity of the spoofed
relates the position change rate to
GPS track. The factor
the signal propagation speed (close to the speed of light). We
note that we need to assure vtrack (cid:4)= 0 and hence require a track
of changing positions. Having related the reported positions
to the spoofer location, we solve each equation towards this
location. In particular, each equation describes all points that
have the same mutual distance differences.
Geometric Interpretation. Considering the solutions of one
relation of the type given by Equation (7), all potential solu-
tions geometrically describe a hyperbola in 2D and a hyper-
boloid in 3D with foci ai, aj and distance difference di,j·
.
vtrack
With two different relations, the possible solutions describe
a curve, which is the intersection between the hyperboloids.
Eventually, three hyperboloids intersect in at most two points,
whereas four or more hyperboloids narrow down the location
of the spoofer to a single point. The general functionality of
this approach is depicted in Figure 8 (2D projection).
Requirements. In order to get at least four different relations,
we need to fulﬁll one of the cases shown in Table III. In
particular, we either require four or more different reference
aircraft or, in the case we have less, we need to gather reports
from the same reference aircraft but from different locations on
their tracks. In other words, position reports sent by only two

aircraft but from four different locations are already sufﬁcient
to perform spoofer localization. Since we consider moving
targets, the transmission origins will also change likewise.
Hence, we are able to trade the number of spoofed aircraft
with the required observation time, which we can formulate
as follows:
(cid:8)
(cid:9)
· ts ≥ 4,
m

(8)
where m is the number of spoofed aircraft and ts denotes the
number of observed samples from different aircraft positions.
The binomial coefﬁcient provides the number of possible
relations. Equation (8) deﬁnes the minimum requirements for
our spoofer localization. If fulﬁlled, we can construct at least
four equations and eventually determine a distinct solution.
Comparison with MLAT. The described localization ap-
proach exhibits similarities to the MLAT process of Sec-
tion III-A but is characterized by decisive differences as com-
pared in Table II. Our approach uses the position information
included in the ADS-B/Flarm reports, whereas MLAT is based
on differences in the time of arrivals at multiple sensors. We
want to highlight that it is not possible to trace the location
of spooﬁng devices with MLAT. In our approach, we thus
exploit a characteristic that is attacker-controlled such as the
spoofed positions in the advertisements. As a result, we obtain
a multilateration with switched roles, i. e., the references are
moving aircraft as compared to the stationary ADS-B/Flarm
sensors. Since the considered measure is shifted from time to
positioning information, we need to adjust the scaling factor
with the velocity of the spoofed track. As a beneﬁcial side
effect, this diminishes the factor with which the uncertainties
in the GPS-derived positions are multiplied and consequently
minimizes the noise impact on the localization accuracy.
2) Error Minimization: In contrast to a deﬁnite analytic
solution considering relations based on Equation (7), real-
world signal reception and measurements suffer from several
error sources and hence prevent a distinct solution for the
spoofer position. Both the positions from MLAT as well as
the reported spoofed GPS positions are affected by noise.
Notably, the interpolation process for time-alignment induces
even more noise into the system. Consequently, compared to
the theoretical analysis, the constructed hyperboloids do not
intersect in a distinct point but rather mark an area.
tion SP, we formulate the following error function Et(·):
Et(SP, i, j) = dist(ai, SP)−dist(aj, SP)−di,j ·

is the distance in the reported ADS-B/Flarm
where di,j
positions and t is the current sample time. The real aircraft
positions are denoted by ai, aj and c is the speed of light.
All resulting errors add up to the overall error, which we try
to minimize by computing the root mean square error (RMSE).
Eventually, our algorithm outputs the most
likely spoofer
position:

with t indicating the sample time corresponding to Equa-
tion (9). The inner two sums aggregate the errors of relations
between all spoofed aircraft, whereas the outer sum aggregates
the errors over all sample times. The argument with the
minimum error is calculated to be the best approximation for
the spoofer position.
When time progresses, the total number of relations consid-
ering different references increases. This also affects the error
minimization process by expanding the system of equations
that are simultaneously evaluated. However, the complexity
increase is only linear and, as we will show, this process
stabilizes quickly. As all measurements are affected by noise,
more relations are beneﬁcial to reduce the system-intrinsic
errors and the localization is predicted to gain precision.
3) Improved Filtering: For GPS spooﬁng targeting multiple
aircraft, we identify an additional optimization technique that
helps to lower the impact of uncertainty in the reported
positions even further. As all affected aircraft receive the
same spooﬁng signals, they report positions on the same track
irrelevant of timing information. This allows to better predict
the underlying track by incorporating all available reports.
Consequently, we can apply a subsequent ﬁltering of the
spoofed aircraft positions.

In particular, we apply a projection of the reported positions
on the combined estimated track. Notably, with this projection
we cannot correct
timing inaccuracies, but we can better
estimate the most likely position at the current measurement
time. The (orthogonal) projection provides the least error with
respect to the estimated track and can be described as:
ˆai − ˆai
(cid:4) ⊥ track,
(11)
(cid:4)
(cid:4)
where ˆai is the noisy GPS position and ˆai
is the projected
point with ˆai − ˆai
being orthogonal on the estimated track.
Moreover, we do not necessarily require a continuous straight
line but the track can also contain separated segments, which
are then evaluated separately to apply the projection.
IV. EVALUATION
To evaluate the applicability of Crowd-GPS-Sec to real-
world air trafﬁc, we assess its performance in terms of
spooﬁng detection and accuracy of the spoofer localization. In
particular, we have implemented Crowd-GPS-Sec and applied
it to real-world data from the OpenSky Network. Moreover,
we have built a simulation framework to generate results with
respect to spooﬁng scenarios.
A. Spooﬁng Detection Performance
We compare our two spooﬁng detection tests with regard to
their coverage, detection delay, and detection rate. The tests
are applied to air trafﬁc data of Central Europe as received
by the OpenSky Network over a period of 1 h. The data set
contains 141,693 unique positions of 142 aircraft.
Coverage. We deﬁne the coverage of a test as the percentage
of aircraft positions that is protected by a test. Protection
means that a test indicates a spooﬁng attack if the aircraft
is indeed spoofed. For simplicity, we assume that the attacker
is using an omnidirectional antenna and is positioned right
underneath the target using exactly the required transmission
power to have the target aircraft lock on the spoofer. This
results in an attack range in the form of a sphere with a radius
of the altitude of the aircraft. Note that this setup models an
unrealistically optimal attacker since in reality, the attacker
may not be able to stay exactly underneath the target aircraft
as the aircraft is moving and it may use higher transmission
powers than the minimal required power.
Since both tests rely on different features,
the sets of
positions covered by one test is different from the one covered
by the other test, but there are overlaps. We therefore analyze
how many aircraft
