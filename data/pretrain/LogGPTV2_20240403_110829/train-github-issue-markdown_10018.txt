What happens:  
When
org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListBeanFactory.findAutowireCandidates()
determines candidate beans, it instantiates all of them at the end. Even when
the candidates are marked as lazy-inited. In my opinion, this is unnecessary.
Lazy-inited candidate should be instantiated only when it is actually chosen
to be the right candidate - which is done later in
DefaultListBeanFactory.doResolveDependency().
What should happen:  
In my opinion, beans marked as lazy-init should be instantiated only when
actually used by the application code. Spring internals should avoid
instantiating them unless really necessary.
This bug is a generalization of Bug #12991. I filed this bug separately
because its resolution might be more complicated (though it needn't) than
#12991, hence this bug has less chance to be resolved quickly.

  * #12240 Migration from 2.5.6 to 3.0.2 - Lazy Init functions differently. ( _ **"is duplicated by"**_ )
  * #12991 Even when primary candidate exists, other lazy bean candidates are instantiated ( _ **"is duplicated by"**_ )
