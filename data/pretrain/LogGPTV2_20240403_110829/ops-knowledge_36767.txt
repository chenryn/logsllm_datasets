User: I'm trying to make a distributable egg with setuptools and my program depends on wget being present, which obviously isn't available in PyPi.  I have a little script which checks for the presence of wget, asking the user to install it and returning -1 if it isn't installed, or returning 0 if it is installed.  
I'd like to complete the installation of my program only if my wget checking script returns 0.  How can I do this with setuptools?
Assistant: Depending on what you need wget for, have you considered writing your own wget-equivalent in python, using the urllib or urllib2 modules?  Then you'll have something that is both cross-platform and under your control, and you'll break your dependency on wget.  Look at the urlretrieve method.
