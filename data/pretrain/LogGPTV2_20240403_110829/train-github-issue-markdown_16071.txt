## Expected Behavior
The ListItemText component should change colour when an override is applied
## Current Behavior
Currently in order to override it I have to disable typography; is there any
way to apply the color whilst maintaining the typography? I tried adding a
Typography component as an element of the ListItemText but this doesn't work.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
See codesandbox here:
https://codesandbox.io/s/2plyrzlvkp
If you navigate to the demo.js you'll see the relevant code.
## Context
If you look at the codepen, the third item has the color red applied, but the
typography is lost due to typography being disabled. Another option is
providing another MuiThemeProvider that is specific to that, but that seems
less than ideal; I thought the purpose of overrides was to get around that
issue?
The reason this presents itself as an issue is when using the dark theme (set
to light at present in the codesandbox), the ListItemText uses white for the
font color, but since the background is also white you end up being unable to
see the text.
## Your Environment
It's all in the sandbox, using material ui next.
