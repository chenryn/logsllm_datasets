Assistant: This log chunk shows the kernel generating multiple cores over a period of time. It begins with three consecutive log entries of 3091200 double-hummer alignment exceptions. Then, there are four log entries of CE sym, at, and mask. Finally, there are nine log entries of generating core. followed by a number.
