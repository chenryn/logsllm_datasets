counts purchased. This assumption holds, because Japanese phone
companies does not rely on usage-based charging for incoming
calls. Cellular lines use dedicated area codes, so that the caller,
in this case, the victim, pays a premium compared to the charge for
calling a landline. Hence, in One Click Frauds, because miscre-
ants only use their lines for incoming calls, they are not charged for
usage.
Finally, because quantifying Presale is difﬁcult, and is likely to
be small in front of the other proﬁts, we simply consider Presale ≥
0. Finally, we assume that each fraud has roughly the same prob-
ability of being successful, and thus, that the total number of users
to fall for all frauds operated by a miscreant is simply given by
multiplying S by n.
With these assumptions, we obtain, for the utility (i.e., the proﬁt
or loss miscreants can expect) U , the following inequality, in ab-
sence of any risks linked to being caught:
U (t) ≥ Sn(t)f − Cinit(t)
−S(Chost(t) + Ccont) − BCbank − KCphone ,(1)
where t denotes time. Clearly, the policy maker wants U < 0. If,
on the other hand, U ≫ 0, there is a high incentive for people to
start fraudulent operations.
5.2 Fraud proﬁtability
We next turn to dimensioning each of the parameters in Eqn. (1).
We consider t = 1 year in all discussions.
We plot the number of occurrences the most commonly requested
amounts of money f are observed in our database in Fig. 5. The
spike at 45,001-50,000 JPY (roughly USD 500) coincides with the
average monthly amount of “pocket money” typical Japanese busi-
nessmen are allowed to take from the household income (45,600
JPY in 2008, [27]).5 The average, over 1,268 records in our database,
stands at f = 60, 462 JPY.
Next, the initial cost Cinit combines that of a computer, which
the fraudster likely already possesses, and of an Internet subscrip-
tion.
If the miscreant does not already own a computer, a basic
model, around 28,000 JPY (e.g., an Asus EeePC 900X), would be
more than sufﬁcient. Likewise, the miscreant probably already sub-
scribes to an Internet service, but assuming they do not, a modest
5In Japan, the wife of the household typically plays the role of

husband and children.
broadband access is all that they need. As an example, in 2009, Ya-
hoo! BroadBand provides an ADSL “8 Mbps” plan for 3,904 JPY
per month [8]. We get 0 ≤ Cinit ≤ 74, 848 JPY, where the upper
bound is given by assuming a fully dedicated machine and Internet
connection for setting up One Click Frauds, and is obtained com-
bining the prices of purchasing a new PC and subscribing for one
year to the Internet service.
We evaluate Chost using maido3.com, a domain reseller and
rental server popular with fraudsters (see Section 4). The Starter
Pack Plan costs 3,675 JPY for an initial setup fee; domain registra-
tion and DNS service is free; the plan requires a three months ad-
vance payment of 22,050 JPY (monthly fee is 7,350 JPY). We gath-
ered these numbers from our email communication with maido3.
com. For a one-year subscription, we obtain Chost = 91, 875 JPY.
Fraudulent bank accounts can be obtained for prices going be-
tween 30,000 and 50,000 JPY [1] from the black market. As pre-
viously mentioned in Section 4, bank accounts are easily forged if
created in Internet banks or banks requiring only postal mail for
new contracts since there is no physical interaction during the con-
tracting process. Also, it is relatively easy to set up fraudulent ac-
counts by taking advantage of the Japanese writing system. Bank
accounts internally use a phonetic alphabet (katakana), different
from the characters used for most names and nouns (kanji). It is
thus possible to create ambiguous account names. For instance,
both the “Baking Club of Shirai City” and “Shiraishi Mitsuko” (a
person’s name) are pronounced exactly the same, and thus would
have the same account holder information. By registering as a non-
proﬁt organization, the fraudster may easily bypass most identity
checks, and subsequently set up fraudulent transfers using the in-
dividual name instead. Creating an account in this fashion would
cost much lower than 50,000 JPY. We can thus conﬁdently assume
Cbank ≤ 50, 000 JPY.
A phone line is required for miscreants to have the ability to fur-
ther pressure and blackmail the victim to pay money. Cell phones
can be illegally purchased for approximately 35,000 JPY [1,3], and
can be made untraceable by paying the monthly subscription fees
of 7,685 JPY/month [3] at a convenience store, or by simply using a
prepaid phone. Forwarding and anonymizing services discussed in
Section 4 can be purchased for only 840 JPY/month [6]. Assuming
all these services are purchased for a year yields an upper bound
Cphone ≤ 137, 300 JPY.
We make the modestly controversial assumption that Ccont = 0.
Indeed, we suspect that most of the pornographic contents pre-
sented in One Click Fraud websites is simply copied and plagia-
rized from other (non-fraudulent) websites, or obtained through
peer-to-peer transfers.
Last, our analysis of Section 4 tells us that, on average, S ≈
3.7 domains, while B ≈ 5.2 accounts, and K ≈ 1.3 phone lines.
These numbers are obtained by looking at the graph G, and di-
viding, the total number of domains operated (481), bank accounts
(684), and phone numbers used (176), by the number of connected
subgraphs we found, including singletons (131).
Reusing these numbers in Eqn (1), we obtain a simple linear
condition for the fraud to be economically viable, that is, for U ≥
0, we need
n ≥ 3.8 users
to fall for each fraud, within one year. This means that, as long as,
for each scam operated, more than four people fall for the scam
within a year, the miscreant turns a proﬁt. In other words, there
is an extremely strong incentive for aspiring criminals to engage in
One Click Fraud. This strong incentive is not very surprising, given
the low amount of skills and equipment needed to set up One Click
23Frauds. What we ﬁnd more interesting is how proﬁtable One Click
Fraud appears to be.

5.3 Legal aspects
The above incentive assessment ignores the probability of get-
ting caught, and the associated penalties resulting from arrest, which
we detail next.
Prosecution probability. Criminals take advantage of social norms
and legal loopholes to commit One Click Frauds. First, most vic-
tims do not report these crimes. Indeed, to be able to legally charge
a suspect, a victim must make a formal complaint to the court. Due
to the embarrassment associated with the context of the fraud, many
victims do not wish to participate in the accusations that may reveal
their identity. Further complicating matters, is the fact that most
DNS resellers and web hosting services used, as we have observed
in our measurements, are physically situated outside of Japan. The
part of the fraud infrastructure hosted in Japan, i.e., the phone line
and the bank account, is equally hard to use for investigation. In-
deed, police cannot obtain contact and network information from
telecommunication networks unless they have an actual arrest war-
rant. Likewise, access to banking accounts is very restricted. Thus,
prosecution probability is actually very low.
Penalties.
In addition, sentences are relatively light. Common
fraud (e.g., blackmail), in Japan, carries a sentence of up to 10 years
of imprisonment. However, One Click Frauds very often do not
meet the legal tests necessary for qualifying as “fraud,” as in the
vast majority of cases, the victim pays up immediately, and there
is no active blackmailing effort from the miscreant. One could ar-
gue that they are nothing more than a sophisticated form of pan-
handling. As a result, the few sentences for cases related to One
Click Fraud made public [2] were rather light, with ﬁnes ranging
from 300,000 JPY to 2,000,000 JPY (≈ USD 3,000 to 20,000) and
prison sentences ranging from probation to 2.5 years of jail time.
5.4 Field measurements
We next use ﬁeld data provided by the Japanese police [15], and
compare their ﬁndings to ours. Note that the report [15] combines
numbers for One Click Frauds and related conﬁdence scams, so the
numbers in this section are much more approximate than we would
wish. However, they remain a useful starting point to roughly as-
sess the economic impact of these frauds.
Number of frauds per miscreant. First, the police acknowledges
2,859 cases of frauds leading to 657 arrests. It is very unlikely that
the police would inﬂate the number of unsolved cases in an external
publication, and it thus appears that each arrested individual was
responsible for an average of 4.4 frauds.6 This number is slightly
higher than S = 3.7 we found earlier, but the difference is hardly
surprising, as the probability of getting caught increases with the
number of sites operated.
Proﬁts made. The Japanese Police estimates, on average, between
2004 and 2008, that 26 billion JPY per year were swindled in var-
ious conﬁdence scams, prominently including One Click Frauds.
Dividing by the number of 2,859 cases the police reports, we ﬁnd
the average income per case to be approximately 9 million JPY over
a year (≈ 90,000 USD), a quite staggering number, especially con-
sidering that each arrested individual was responsible for about four
cases, potentially making around 360,000 USD. While we believe
that this is likely an over-estimate, due to the unpublished number
6In Japan, arrests are usually made only when the police is certain
with 99% probability or more of the suspect’s guilt. The conviction
rate is thus very high.

of unsolved cases, as well as, some potential exaggeration in the
losses incurred, the proﬁt made by miscreants in practice appears
sizable.
We can compare this estimate with reports gathered from the
press, which we summarize in Table 5. The proﬁts made appear to
be very high, which is not overly surprising considering the num-
ber of victims involved. Recall from the previous section, that one
only needs about four victims to break even. Clearly, with vic-
tim numbers in the 450–10,000 range, we can expect very signiﬁ-
cant proﬁts, which, in Table 5 are estimated between approximately
USD 28,000 and 600,000 for each group arrested. Thus, the USD
90,000 – 360,000 estimate acquired from the police reports seems
to be in the right order of magnitude.
Ironically, the case reported in [38] names the suspect as a fa-
mous IT writer specializing in cybercrime and appearing in mul-
tiple TV programs to warn the public of the dangers of One Click
Fraud. One cannot help but think that the suspect, being very famil-
iar with the inner working of One Click Fraud, must have reached
a conclusion identical to that of the present paper, that is, that there
is a signiﬁcant economic advantage to engage in such frauds.
We also note that these arrests were likely possible by the sheer
magnitude of the fraud. A criminal conﬁning themselves to only
a few dozens victims would likely be able to make a reasonable
proﬁt, while being hard to catch.
6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive picture of a con-
ﬁdence scam used in Japan, called One Click Fraud. By gathering
over 2,000 reports of incidents from vigilante websites, we were
able to describe a number of potential vulnerabilities that miscre-
ants use (lax registration checks, resellers turning a blind eye to
their customers’ activities), and also showed that the market ap-
pears to be quite heavily concentrated. The top eight miscreant
groups are responsible for more than half the frauds we uncovered.
At the same time, a large number of individuals seem to be partici-
pating in frauds of smaller magnitude.
We showed that an important reason for these scams to ﬂourish
is the strong economic incentives miscreants have. They can break
even as soon as they manage to successfully scam four victims for
each fraud, and, on average can make proﬁts in the order of USD
10,000-100,000 or more per year. Prosecution is difﬁcult, since
victims are reluctant to come forward, and the penalties that can be
meted are relatively light.
Reforming the law to impose harsher penalties is not easy, as
proving the mere existence of a crime is cumbersome. On the other
hand, prevention, identiﬁcation, and take-down seems more feasi-
ble. Our study shows that identifying perpetrators can greatly bene-
ﬁt from a bird’s eye view of the network. In our discussions with the
police, we learned that different cases are usually assigned to sep-
arate ofﬁcers, and that communication could be greatly improved.
For instance, one ofﬁcer may investigate a fraudulent phone num-
ber, while another may be investigating an online fraud.
If the
24phone number is used in said fraud, clearly both ofﬁcers would
beneﬁt from sharing the results of their investigations. However,
such holistic approaches remain relatively rare in practice.
Future work. We believe that, while we tried to provide as compre-
hensive a study as possible, we could enrich the data we obtained by
looking for connections with other forms of crime in more details.
Our conclusions, thus far, are that these domains do not apparently
engage in other forms of fraud, but are based on a relatively simple
check of known blacklists. Studying in more details WHOIS reg-
istrations cross-listings, as well as possible connections with more
“mainstream” pornographic sites could reveal further insights.
Also, an article issued at the time of this writing [9] shows that
One Click Fraud is now using peer-to-peer software as a prop-
agation vector for viruses very similar to Trojan.HachiLem.
While the propagation method is new, the psychological factors
making such scams successful remain the same. Finding how to
address these psychological traits is a promising area of research,
quite related to ongoing works in security psychology [28].
We have also observed, in the police records that we eventually
were not able to use, that 71 out of 359 scams reported were SMS-
based. That is, One Click Frauds are also affecting mobile web-
sites. Whether the perpetrators are the same, or different groups,
remains unknown, and would warrant further investigation.
Despite being focused on a very speciﬁc crime, we believe that
some of the methodology we used in this paper (graph-theory based
modeling, and clustering techniques, for example) could very well
apply to other forms of online frauds. As mentioned in the intro-
duction, One Click Frauds are closely related to the more general
body of scareware scams, and some of the techniques we use could
equally apply to analyzing scareware markets. More generally, we
hope this paper will help facilitate an ambitious research agenda to
gather more data from online criminal activities. An improved un-
derstanding of the economics of online crime is indeed essential in
determining which policies may work to curb the problem.
