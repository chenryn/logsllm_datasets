# 5.1 Economic Incentives for One Click Fraud

To understand the economic incentives behind One Click Fraud, we need to analyze the profit and cost structure of these fraudulent activities. The utility \( U \) (i.e., the expected profit or loss for the miscreant) can be expressed by the following inequality:

\[
U(t) \geq S \cdot n(t) \cdot f - C_{\text{init}}(t) - S \cdot (C_{\text{host}}(t) + C_{\text{cont}}) - B \cdot C_{\text{bank}} - K \cdot C_{\text{phone}}
\]

where:
- \( t \) denotes time.
- \( S \) is the number of domains operated.
- \( n(t) \) is the number of victims per domain.
- \( f \) is the fee amount requested from each victim.
- \( C_{\text{init}} \) is the initial setup cost.
- \( C_{\text{host}} \) is the hosting cost.
- \( C_{\text{cont}} \) is the content creation cost.
- \( B \) is the number of bank accounts used.
- \( C_{\text{bank}} \) is the cost of obtaining a fraudulent bank account.
- \( K \) is the number of phone lines used.
- \( C_{\text{phone}} \) is the cost of obtaining and maintaining a phone line.

The figure below shows the ten most common amounts of money requested in One Click Frauds, based on our database.

| Fee Amount (in yen) | Frequency |
|---------------------|-----------|
| 0                   | 1,001-5,000 |
| 250                 | 30,001-35,000 |
| 500                 | 40,001-45,000 |
| 750                 | 35,001-40,000 |
| 1,000               | 45,001-50,000 |
| 1,250               | 50,001-55,000 |
| 1,500               | 55,001-60,000 |
| 1,750               | 75,001-80,000 |
| 2,000               | 85,001-90,000 |
| 2,250               | 95,001-100,000 |

### Analysis of Costs and Profits

#### Initial Setup Cost (\( C_{\text{init}} \))

The initial setup cost includes the cost of a computer and an Internet subscription. If the miscreant does not already own a computer, a basic model such as an Asus EeePC 900X costs around 28,000 JPY. An Internet subscription, if not already available, can be obtained for 3,904 JPY per month (e.g., Yahoo! BroadBand ADSL "8 Mbps" plan). Therefore, the total initial cost is:

\[
0 \leq C_{\text{init}} \leq 74,848 \text{ JPY}
\]

#### Hosting Cost (\( C_{\text{host}} \))

We evaluated the hosting cost using maido3.com, a popular domain reseller and rental server among fraudsters. The Starter Pack Plan costs 3,675 JPY for an initial setup fee, with a monthly fee of 7,350 JPY. For a one-year subscription, the total hosting cost is:

\[
C_{\text{host}} = 91,875 \text{ JPY}
\]

#### Bank Account Cost (\( C_{\text{bank}} \))

Fraudulent bank accounts can be obtained from the black market for prices ranging between 30,000 and 50,000 JPY. Given the ease of creating ambiguous account names due to the Japanese writing system, we can assume:

\[
C_{\text{bank}} \leq 50,000 \text{ JPY}
\]

#### Phone Line Cost (\( C_{\text{phone}} \))

A phone line is necessary for further pressuring and blackmailing the victim. A cell phone can be illegally purchased for approximately 35,000 JPY, with monthly subscription fees of 7,685 JPY. Forwarding and anonymizing services cost 840 JPY per month. Assuming all these services are purchased for a year, the total phone line cost is:

\[
C_{\text{phone}} \leq 137,300 \text{ JPY}
\]

#### Content Creation Cost (\( C_{\text{cont}} \))

We assume that the content presented in One Click Fraud websites is often plagiarized from other non-fraudulent websites or obtained through peer-to-peer transfers. Therefore, we set:

\[
C_{\text{cont}} = 0
\]

#### Number of Victims and Domains

From our analysis, the average number of domains operated is \( S \approx 3.7 \), while the average number of bank accounts and phone lines used are \( B \approx 5.2 \) and \( K \approx 1.3 \), respectively. These numbers are derived from the graph \( G \) by dividing the total number of domains, bank accounts, and phone numbers by the number of connected subgraphs.

### Profitability Condition

Substituting these values into the utility equation, we obtain the condition for the fraud to be economically viable:

\[
n \geq 3.8 \text{ users}
\]

This means that as long as more than four people fall for each scam within a year, the miscreant turns a profit. This strong incentive is not surprising given the low skills and equipment needed to set up One Click Frauds.

# 5.2 Legal Aspects

### Prosecution Probability

Criminals exploit social norms and legal loopholes to commit One Click Frauds. Many victims do not report these crimes due to embarrassment, and the infrastructure used (DNS resellers and web hosting services) is often located outside Japan, making investigation difficult. Thus, the probability of prosecution is very low.

### Penalties

Sentences for common fraud in Japan can range up to 10 years of imprisonment. However, One Click Frauds often do not meet the legal criteria for "fraud," resulting in lighter sentences. Fines range from 300,000 JPY to 2,000,000 JPY, and prison sentences range from probation to 2.5 years.

# 5.3 Field Measurements

### Police Data

The Japanese police report 2,859 cases of fraud leading to 657 arrests. Each arrested individual was responsible for an average of 4.4 frauds. The estimated annual swindled amount is 26 billion JPY, with an average income per case of approximately 9 million JPY (â‰ˆ 90,000 USD).

### Press Reports

Press reports also indicate high profits, with estimates ranging from approximately USD 28,000 to 600,000 for each group arrested. This aligns with the police estimates, suggesting significant economic advantages for engaging in One Click Frauds.

# 6. Discussion and Conclusions

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of One Click Fraud in Japan. By gathering over 2,000 incident reports, we identified vulnerabilities and showed that the market is heavily concentrated. The top eight miscreant groups are responsible for more than half of the frauds. Economic incentives are strong, with miscreants breaking even after scamming just four victims. Prosecution is difficult due to reluctant victims and light penalties. Future work could explore connections with other forms of crime and the psychological factors driving these scams.
