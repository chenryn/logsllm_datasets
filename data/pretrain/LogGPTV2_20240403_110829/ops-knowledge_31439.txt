User: Why do you need system monitoring and log analysis? Please provide relevant actual cases and application scenarios.
Assistant: System monitoring and log analysis are performed to ensure system stability, security and performance optimization. The following are relevant actual cases and application scenarios: 1. When the website traffic peaks, the system response slows down, and performance monitoring and analysis are required to find out the reason for the slow response and optimize it to ensure the availability and user experience of the website. 2. When the database is abnormal, it is necessary to find out the problem in time and solve it as soon as possible to prevent data loss and system crash. 3. The system is attacked by hackers, abnormal operations are found in the system log, and defensive measures are taken in time to protect the system and data security. 4. Vehicle monitoring systems, security monitoring systems, production process monitoring systems and other scenarios that need to collect, analyze and process large amounts of data in a timely manner. By monitoring data, intelligent management and better business decisions can be achieved. 5. There are many detailed problems in the enterprise network, such as hardware failures, malware, security vulnerabilities, etc., which require system monitoring and log analysis to help managers better understand the network environment and diagnose problems. In short, system monitoring and log analysis can help organizations find problems, take timely measures, and improve system stability, availability, and security.
