ABSTRACT
The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an overlay network
that provides secure and anonymous communication chan-
nels. EepSites are the anonymous websites hosted in the I2P
network. To access the eepSites, DNS requests of a domain
name sufﬁxed with the .i2p pseudo top-level domain (TLD)
are routed within the I2P network. However, not only that
.i2p queries are leaking in the public DNS infrastructure,
but also such leakage has various plausible root causes and
implications that are different from other related leakage. In
this paper, we analyze the leaked .i2p requests captured in
the A and J root name servers of the public DNS, showing
that a large number of queries are observed and outlining
various potential directions of addressing such leakage.

INTRODUCTION
The Domain Name System (DNS) is an essential Internet
protocol used in the public and private network systems, and
serves as a translator of domain names into numerical IP ad-
dresses. The DNS consists of a hierarchical tree structure,
and there are 13 root name servers at the top of the hierar-
chy. In “example.com”, .com is called TLD while example
is called SLD (second level domain). During resolution, root
servers answer requests based on the authorized TLD.
Some systems use a customized DNS that utilizes a pseudo-
TLD in a private network setting. Such systems include Tor,

which utilizes the .onion pseudo-TLD, which has been stud-
ied in the past and shown to leak queries to the public DNS
infrastructure [4]. Such leakage has various privacy and se-
curity consequences.
I2P [3], an anonymous network, is similar to Tor [2] in
utilizing pseudo-TLD for naming convention of services that
are supposed to be resolved within a private network. I2P in-
ternally implements a customized DNS using the .i2p pseudo-
TLD. EepSite is a service to provide secure and anonymous
web browsing experience within the I2P network. To ac-
cess those eepSites, hosts in the I2P network use .i2p do-
main name to connect to servers. Although the pseudo-TLD
.i2p is supposed to be used within the I2P network, various
anecdotes indicate that .i2p DNS queries leak to the public
DNS [1]. While .onion leakage has been widely reported
and studied, a systematic study of .i2p leakage is lacking.
Contribution and dataset. We present the state of .i2p by
analyzing leakage in the public DNS infrastructure at two
root DNS servers over 127 days (from Sep 5, 2013 to Jan 9,
2014). The dataset was collected at the A and J root servers.
We found that many .i2p queries were leaked to the pub-
lic DNS root servers. This leakage has several implications
based on various plausible root causes and observations that
we outlined.
2. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
The dataset collected for this work was over 127 days. We
observed (i) there are more than 6.4 million queries, with an
average of more than 50.5 thousand queries per day, (ii) a
general upward trend in the daily trafﬁc volume from Octo-
ber 2013 to January 2014, corresponding to an increase in
the leakage, and consistent with the prior study on .onion
leakage [4], and (iii) persistent level of the .i2p leakage.
Query source. Table 1 lists the top 3 countries that re-
quested .i2p queries. Our previous study presenting .onion
leakage from the A and J root servers for the same period
revealed that hosts (and recursive resolvers) in United States
generated more .onion requests than other country [4]. Hosts
in Russia and China generated the most .i2p queries, high-
lighting the unique users population of I2P that is different
from Tor.
General trends and events. The trend of .i2p queries cap-
tured at the A and J root servers is shown in Figure 1. We
found: (i) there were clear trafﬁc spikes at the two roots

browsers perform web prefetching including domain name
pre-resolutions to improve the user experience. As a result,
some of the .i2p queries could be the result of web browsers
proactively parsing web pages for potential domain names
and attempting to resolve them using the conventional DNS
resolution. (iii) Malware. Malware families also utilize I2P
network to communicate with command and control servers
so that they can conceal activities and resist takedown ef-
forts. To access the I2P network, that malware requires cer-
tain software libraries and conﬁgurations. For example, we
conﬁrm such leakage with Dyre, a banking Trojan that uses
I2P [5].
4. CONCLUSION
We measured a persistent form of leakage of .i2p queries
in the public DNS infrastructure by observing DNS request
at the A and J root servers. We analyze various aspects of the
leaked requests, and show various unique characteristics of
the sources of requests, spikes in the volume of requests, and
the requested services. We contrast this analysis to .onion
leakage, highlighting a different use of I2P than Tor. We are
currently pursuing further analysis to quantitatively under-
stand root causes and potential implications of leakage.

dated on Sep 15 and Oct 28, 2013, (ii) the .i2p volume
trend in the two leading countries dominated the trend of
the entire requests, (iii) the requests from China showed a
steady upward trend for our observation period, (iv) unlike
Tor, where spikes coincided with political unrest and censor-
ship events [4], .i2p spikes coincided with the release of new
contents sharing services, or the move of legitimate free con-
tents sharing services to I2P due to outages (e.g., the ranking
of the service at #3 in Table 2 coincided with a DDoS attack).
Queries per SLD. Figure 2 shows the CDF of the query
numbers over all strings sufﬁxed in .i2p pseudo-TLD. We
found: (i) there were 297,118 .i2p SLDs leaked from the
A and J root servers, (ii) the distribution is strongly heavy-
tailed, with only 0.08% of all .i2p SLDs receiving more than
1,000 queries, 98.8% receiving less than ten queries, and
95% receiving only one query.
Popular services. Table 2 shows the top 5 .i2p services,
their type, and share of the total number of .i2p queries as
a percent. By looking into the type of services, we found
that they were mostly forums, and sharing services for copy-
righted and free contents. In comparison, .onion leaked names
were used for serving, in addition to the types of services in
.i2p, underground marketplaces (such as silk road, agora,
etc.) and other legitimate services (blocked in certain coun-
tries). We notice that services ranked two to ﬁve referred to
Russian eepSites for contents of similar types, perhaps as a
form of replication to defeat takedown efforts.
3. POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSES
While concretely understanding the root causes of the leak-
age of .i2p queries to the public DNS infrastructure is still
an ongoing and active effort, we provide various high-level
plausible causes. (i) User misconception and misconﬁg-
urations. Some users who are unfamiliar with I2P treat
.i2p domains as ordinary ones and try to resolve them ac-
cordingly. Even when users are aware of the special use of
.i2p queries, leakage could be too due to browser’s proxy
settings misconﬁguration. (ii) Browser prefetching. Web
