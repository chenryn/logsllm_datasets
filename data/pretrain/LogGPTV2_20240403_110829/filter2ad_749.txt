## Abstract
The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an overlay network that provides secure and anonymous communication channels. EepSites are anonymous websites hosted within the I2P network. To access these EepSites, DNS requests for domain names with the .i2p pseudo top-level domain (TLD) are routed within the I2P network. However, .i2p queries are leaking into the public DNS infrastructure. This leakage has various plausible root causes and implications that differ from other related leakages. In this paper, we analyze the leaked .i2p requests captured by the A and J root name servers of the public DNS, demonstrating a significant number of queries and outlining potential directions to address such leakage.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) is an essential Internet protocol used in both public and private network systems, serving as a translator of domain names into numerical IP addresses. The DNS follows a hierarchical tree structure, with 13 root name servers at the top. In "example.com", ".com" is the TLD (Top-Level Domain), and "example" is the SLD (Second-Level Domain). During resolution, root servers respond based on the authorized TLD.

Some systems, such as Tor, use a customized DNS with a pseudo-TLD in a private network setting. For example, Tor uses the .onion pseudo-TLD, which has been studied and shown to leak queries to the public DNS infrastructure [4]. Such leakage has various privacy and security consequences.

I2P [3], an anonymous network, is similar to Tor in using a pseudo-TLD for naming services that should be resolved within a private network. I2P internally implements a customized DNS using the .i2p pseudo-TLD. EepSites provide secure and anonymous web browsing within the I2P network. To access these EepSites, hosts in the I2P network use .i2p domain names. Although .i2p is intended for use within the I2P network, anecdotal evidence suggests that .i2p DNS queries leak to the public DNS [1]. While .onion leakage has been widely reported and studied, a systematic study of .i2p leakage is lacking.

### Contribution and Dataset
We present a comprehensive analysis of .i2p leakage in the public DNS infrastructure, observed over 127 days (from September 5, 2013, to January 9, 2014) at the A and J root DNS servers. We found that many .i2p queries were leaked to the public DNS root servers. This leakage has several implications based on various plausible root causes and observations that we outline.

## 2. Measurements and Results
The dataset collected for this work spans 127 days. Our key findings include:
- Over 6.4 million queries, averaging more than 50.5 thousand queries per day.
- An upward trend in daily traffic volume from October 2013 to January 2014, consistent with prior studies on .onion leakage [4].
- Persistent levels of .i2p leakage.

### Query Source
Table 1 lists the top three countries that generated .i2p queries. Hosts in Russia and China generated the most .i2p queries, highlighting a different user population compared to Tor.

| Rank | Country | Requests | Traffic (%) |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1    | RUS     | 1,915,863 | 29.84       |
| 2    | USA     | 1,214,040 | 18.91       |
| 3    | CHN     | 764,586   | 11.91       |

### General Trends and Events
Figure 1 shows the trend of .i2p queries captured at the A and J root servers. Key observations include:
- Clear traffic spikes on September 15 and October 28, 2013.
- The .i2p volume trend in the two leading countries dominated the overall trend.
- Requests from China showed a steady upward trend.
- Unlike Tor, where spikes coincided with political unrest and censorship events, .i2p spikes coincided with the release of new content-sharing services or the move of legitimate free content-sharing services to I2P due to outages.

### Queries per SLD
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the query numbers over all strings suffixed with .i2p. We found:
- 297,118 unique .i2p SLDs leaked from the A and J root servers.
- The distribution is strongly heavy-tailed, with only 0.08% of all .i2p SLDs receiving more than 1,000 queries, 98.8% receiving less than ten queries, and 95% receiving only one query.

### Popular Services
Table 2 shows the top five .i2p services, their type, and their share of the total number of .i2p queries.

| Rank | Masked SLD      | Type of Service           | Traffic (%) |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | bt---gg.i2p     | Torrent search engine      | 15.53       |
| 2    | u7---tq.i2p     | E-book search engine       | 8.61        |
| 3    | fl---ta.i2p     | E-book sharing forum       | 7.69        |
| 4    | zm---hq.i2p     | E-book sharing forum       | 6.61        |
| 5    | nn---ub.i2p     | Torrent search engine      | 5.03        |

## 3. Potential Root Causes
While understanding the root causes of .i2p query leakage to the public DNS infrastructure is an ongoing effort, we provide several plausible causes:
- **User Misconception and Misconfiguration**: Some users unfamiliar with I2P treat .i2p domains as ordinary ones and attempt to resolve them accordingly. Even when users are aware of the special use of .i2p queries, leakage can occur due to browser proxy settings misconfiguration.
- **Browser Prefetching**: Web browsers perform web prefetching, including domain name pre-resolutions, to improve user experience. This can result in .i2p queries being sent to the conventional DNS.
- **Malware**: Malware families, such as Dyre, a banking Trojan, use the I2P network to communicate with command and control servers, concealing activities and resisting takedown efforts. These malware require certain software libraries and configurations, leading to .i2p query leakage.

## 4. Conclusion
We measured a persistent form of .i2p query leakage in the public DNS infrastructure by observing DNS requests at the A and J root servers. We analyzed various aspects of the leaked requests, showing unique characteristics of the request sources, spikes in request volume, and requested services. We contrast this analysis with .onion leakage, highlighting different usage patterns of I2P compared to Tor. Further analysis is underway to quantitatively understand the root causes and potential implications of the leakage.
