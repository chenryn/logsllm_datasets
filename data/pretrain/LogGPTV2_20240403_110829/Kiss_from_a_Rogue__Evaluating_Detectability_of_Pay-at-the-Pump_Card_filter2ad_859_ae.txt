difﬁcult to pick and have complex keys that are designed to be
more difﬁcult to duplicate.4 We were interested in how these
newer locks are bypassed and our law enforcement contacts
described multiple situations in which high security keys were
stolen or loaned/bought from a store attendant for hundreds of
dollars. In other cases, the locks may be disengaged (“High
Security locks & stickers in place/lock wasn’t locked” (317))
or broken (“High security locks/broken on pumps 1 & 2”
(698)). Accordingly, these locks are insufﬁcient on their own
for preventing skimmers and cannot indicate tampering without
physical damage.

ment).
Vampire clip skimmers attach to the ribbon cable between
the card reader and the upstream control circuitry. They clamp
over the ribbon cable and break the shielding, allowing the
device to tap the connection. These devices require careful
placement of the skimmer over the ribbon cable to avoid
damaging the connection and are speciﬁc to the thickness of
the cable being used. We have not yet obtained a vampire
clip skimmer, but expect
they have similar retrieval
characteristics to other skimmers.
that
As we discussed in Section IV, the use of Bluetooth, cellu-
lar, and non-wireless skimmers prevents commodity consumer
hardware from detecting skimmers wirelessly. Skimmers with
a variety of data retrieval mechanisms do not present a consis-
tent wireless signature for detection, and this data shows that
the types of skimmers we examined earlier are being found in
the ﬁeld.
Discovery. According to our contacts, most skimmers are
discovered during routine inspection by the Florida Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Consumer Services. However, some
reports noted who initially found the skimmer: “discovered
by technician” (37 comments), “discovered by facility” (26
comments), “discovered by law enforcement” (4 comments),
and “discovered by consumer” (3 comments).
Gas pumps are not always managed by the facility’s
operators, and the business structure of this (leasing, con-

tracting, etc.) is outside of the scope of this paper. However,
we separated phrasing such as “Skimmer found by owner
during routing inspection/Properly placed security tape” (446)
from “Pumps have properly placed security tape/skimmers
found by Pump Tech” (542) into “discovered by facility” and
“discovered by technician” respectively in order to capture
these distinct groups.
Limitations. To the best of our knowledge, this data is the
best available aggregate data for detected skimmers, but it
has limitations; all ﬁelds are human-generated free responses.
Some entries record data about multiple skimmers or multiple
pumps at the same facility. The entries also do not specify an
exhaustive description of the skimmers or security measures.
Since this dataset is long-term, it is possible that how the data
was entered or interpreted changed over time.
This data also represents conditions when skimmers were
found, not when they were installed; the placement of seals and
other controls could have occurred after skimmer installation,
but this would highlight a similar problem where pumps are
not being correctly checked before applying a seal. While this
data has been aggregated, the reports come from individual
inspectors and other law enforcement ofﬁcers, so clariﬁcation
of ambiguous text was not possible. Accordingly,
in this
section, we have analyzed the data as provided. This data
highlights the real-world problems with protecting gas pumps
against skimmers.
C. Lessons Learned
In this section, we began by characterizing the only visible
security indicator available to consumers for detecting gas
pump tampering: tamper-evident seals. Besides being the only
visible indicator, these seals are also the least expensive and
easiest to deploy by businesses. We deﬁned the properties that
whomever evaluates a seal must decide: presence, placement,
intent, identity, and indication. We then obtained and analyzed
over three years of aggregate data on skimmer detections by
the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
and found that seals are the most frequent security control used
on pumps. On pumps where skimmers have been discovered,
they are most often found with security seals in place. Worse,
attacks are reported on 4 of 5 characteristics that must be
evaluated on a seal, creating further difﬁculty for evaluating
these seals. Ultimately, these seals do not indicate when a
skimmer is present and are easily evaded by adversaries.
VI. DISCUSSION
it
is clear that
Based on our analyses of current skimmer detection ap-
plications,
the possible detection methods
are limited and can not provide consumers with tools that
accurately detect skimming devices. Our analysis of hard-
ware from Section IV is evidence that even with similar
constructions, skimmers can vary in methods of data retrieval
and no characteristic of this can be guaranteed and used as
a method of detection. As long as skimmer detection apps
rely on limited methods including Bluetooth scanning, MAC
address recognition, and blacklists, the apps will continue to
be ineffective and leave the consumer unknowingly vulnerable.
Aside from poorly developed detection tools, we found
tamper-evident seals are also ineffective with helping
that
consumers detect skimming. The seals used at North American
gas stations often differ by fuel brand, seal brand, station
owner, and placement. We have observed municipal pump
seals, branded seals, and generic seals—all in a variety of
sizes, colors and fonts. Some have serial numbers; others do
not. We have also observed multiple styles of seal on the same
pump. Inconsistencies in seal presence, placement, and identity
prevent successful consumer evaluation, and our results in
Section V demonstrate that resolving these would be a partial
solution at best. Our analysis has demonstrated that consumer-
facing tools for detecting gas pump skimmers can fall short
for a variety of reasons. As skimming technology adapts,
the number of available detection mechanisms for consumers
dwindles.
A. Countermeasures
Use another required security measure/deprecate seals. As
we previously discussed, in Florida, operators are generally
required to deploy tamper-evident seals, a device that will
disable the terminal when opened, or an encrypting card
reader [1]. Our data in Section V shows that tamper-evident
seals are overwhelmingly the only control reported present
when skimmers are found. Neither disabling devices nor
encrypting card readers appeared in reports, suggesting that
either these devices are effective or not in use.
Anti-tampering equipment to electronically disable a ter-
minal when opened is common practice among PIN Entry
Devices (PEDs) [56]. However, it is unclear if adding these
devices to gas pumps is ﬁnancially feasible or how store
operators with a single on-site employee would handle false
positives. We discussed in Section V that
insider threats
are also problematic. If a malicious employee can re-enable
the pump, then the disabling device will not be effective.
Accordingly, these devices require new processes and handling
to work. Encrypting card readers also require additional care
in deployment; key management and back-end processing
add complexity which may complicate deployment for small
businesses.
The correct deployment of either of these technologies
effectively renders internal skimmers useless. A disabled pump
cannot accept cards and an encrypting reader does not transmit
sensitive account data as plaintext. This would make external
(i.e., overlay and deep-insert) skimmers the simplest attack
at gas pumps; the Skim Reaper system from Scaife et al. is
designed to detect these types of attacks [45]. We recommend
the removal of tamper-evident seals as a sufﬁcient security
measure from existing or future regulation.
Invest in alternative payment mechanisms. Given the preva-
lence of smartphones (which increasingly offer NFC payment
mechanisms), it may be advantageous to merchants to instead
invest in wireless payment mechanisms. These technologies
typically do not use static account data, reducing the viabil-
ity of skimming attacks. The apps used for these payments
offer fast updates without further hardware updates, which
may avoid further costly upgrades. One disadvantage of this
approach is that these mechanisms are not inclusive. In order
to use wireless payment mechanisms, users need to own a
smartphone that has support for such payment methods. Not
all people have such a device, and some may not elect to

use such technology even if they did. Gas pumps would still
need to continue to support card payment for these individuals
resulting in skimmers still being a problem. Another disad-
vantage to this approach is that malicious terminals are often
not considered in attack models for payment systems (and
can be exploited in EMV [23]). Given the difﬁculty operators
have securing existing pumps, it may difﬁcult to achieve the
needed level of trust with existing technology. Consequently,
we believe more work is needed to develop strong controls for
wireless pay-at-the-pump technology.
Due to the ﬁnancial constraints regarding replacing ex-
isting terminal hardware (see Section II), we believe this
approach is only viable if sufﬁcient consumer demand exists.
The initial deployment of pay-at-the-pump technology took
approximately two decades to reach ubiquity [36] and was
likely driven by consumer demand for a more convenient
payment mechanism. Without such demand, terminal replace-
ments seem unlikely without either an authoritative force (e.g.,
regulation or contractual obligation) or subsidies/discounts to
lower the ﬁnancial burden on businesses. We suspect that force
without ﬁnancial assistance is likely to result in the closure
of stores who cannot otherwise afford new technology. We
recommend that future research into new types of payment
mechanisms consider deployment cost as a feature and that
regulators consider how these changes will affect businesses.
Interrupt the payment workﬂow. Finally, other research
from our community [26], [40] suggests that interrupting the
payment workﬂow may be successful in bringing consumers’
attention to the security indicators. An on-screen message
could display an image of a correct seal, the seal’s serial
number, and require acknowledgment (e.g., inputting the serial
number on the seal) before proceeding. Such a system could
conceivably be deployed as a software update to existing
hardware, though many existing pumps allow the consumer to
begin the transaction by inserting their payment card, which
might render a system like this ineffective at preventing skim-
ming. While users might be unwilling to accept an interrupted
payment ﬂow, it may be possible to use human interaction to
detect tampering similarly to other problems in our community.
This is not a panacea. Even with additional consumer
awareness and individually-numbered seals, our analysis shows
that attackers actively target
is likely that
attackers would simply adjust their replacement seals to match
the on-screen instructions. Accordingly, we do not recommend
this mechanism, but we note it here for completeness.
these seals. It
B. Summary
We believe the fastest and most cost-effective solution
is to physically enhance the security of gas pumps to deny
attackers access to the inside of the unit. Though such security
mechanisms for gas pumps are not yet widespread, similar
technologies already exist for other payment terminals, and
these should be explored before relying on human-based
checks for detection.
VII. RELATED WORK
Research in security indicators largely focuses on the
interaction between the indicators and the user base [18]. This
is most prevalent in web browsers, where visual messaging is
critical to informing users of threats to their online safety [22],
[47], [57], [27], [8]. Experiments on these indicators show
that users notice these far less frequently unless their task
is interrupted [26]. Similarly, research has demonstrated that
while many webcams use indicators (e.g., lights), they are
largely unnoticed until an obvious, red indicator was overlaid
onto the user’s display [40].
Security indicators are also critical to physical assets in-
cluding those in healthcare [48], [55], voting machines [29],
[14], [55], and payment devices [24]. Tamper-evident seals
are intended to convey information about the conﬁdentiality
or integrity of an enclosure. Johnston analyzed hundreds of
seal designs and found the median time to successfully attack
(defeat or spoof) a seal was 43 seconds with a cost of less than
one dollar on subsequent attacks [30]. Our research expands
this work by exploring these seals when applied to payment
systems (speciﬁcally, the task of buying fuel).
Payment systems fraud detection research focuses primarily
on deciding whether to allow a transaction at the time that
transaction occurs [15], [51], [16], [50], [6], [7]. This type
of analysis reduces the quantity of magnetic stripe fraud but
ignores issues of both illegitimate encoding of correct card data
and data acquisition. MagnePrint [2] attempts to resolve the
former by measuring a card’s magnetic material at manufacture
and verifying the measurement upon card use. Since this
system requires a priori measurement, it cannot be used to
verify previously-issued cards. To address this, Scaife et al.
developed a system for using the encoding jitter of the data
to distinguish counterfeit writes from originals [46] without
needing a measurement during manufacturing. Characteriza-
tion of skimming attacks has also led to techniques capable of
detecting multiple card readers (i.e., overlay and deep-insert
skimmers) [45]. These techniques do not apply to other types
of skimmers, such as the internal ones predominantly found
inside gas pumps. Furthermore, while recent technologies such
as EMV payment cards have made duplication more difﬁ-
cult, this has largely moved attacks further into the payment
terminal [54], [33], [9], [20], [23], [35], [25], [13], [31],
[11]. Understanding detectability of attacks on customer-facing
terminals is therefore critical to improving payment systems
security.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Our comprehensive analysis provides strong evidence that
consumers have not been given the tools necessary to protect
themselves against fraud at the pump. We then showed that
while skimmer detection apps are available for the most
popular mobile platforms, few can detect any skimmers at
all. Moreover, through a forensic analysis of actual skimmers
recovered by law enforcement, we demonstrate that those apps
that can detect skimmers can trivially be evaded. Finally,
through the most comprehensive analysis of skimmers discov-
ered over the course of nearly four years, we show that anti-
theft mechanisms such as tamper-evident seals provide little
impediment to criminals. Simply arguing that deploying EMV
solves the problem ignores the massive expenses and logistical
challenges facing the industry; rather, a coordinated effort to
protect consumers and reduce fraud must be undertaken.
