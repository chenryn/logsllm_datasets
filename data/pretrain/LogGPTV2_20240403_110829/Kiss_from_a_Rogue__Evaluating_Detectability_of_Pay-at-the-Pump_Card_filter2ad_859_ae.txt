### Difficulties with High-Security Locks

High-security locks, which are designed to be more challenging to duplicate, have been a subject of interest in our study. Our law enforcement contacts have reported multiple instances where high-security keys were either stolen or obtained from store attendants for several hundred dollars. In other cases, the locks were either not engaged ("High Security locks & stickers in place/lock wasn’t locked" (317)) or broken ("High security locks/broken on pumps 1 & 2" (698)). Consequently, these locks alone are insufficient for preventing skimming devices and cannot indicate tampering without visible physical damage.

### Types of Skimmers

The comments in our dataset specified various types of skimmers:
- "Bluetooth skimmer" (22 comments)
- "Cellular skimmer" (15 comments)
- "Non-wireless skimmer" (1 comment)
- "Vampire clip skimmer" (1 comment)

**Vampire Clip Skimmers:**
These skimmers attach to the ribbon cable between the card reader and the upstream control circuitry. They clamp over the ribbon cable, breaking the shielding and allowing the device to intercept the data. The placement of these skimmers requires precision to avoid damaging the connection, and they must match the specific thickness of the cable. Although we have not yet obtained a vampire clip skimmer, we expect their retrieval characteristics to be similar to those of other skimmers.

As discussed in Section IV, the use of Bluetooth, cellular, and non-wireless skimmers makes it difficult for commodity consumer hardware to detect them wirelessly. These skimmers employ a variety of data retrieval mechanisms, making it challenging to develop a consistent wireless signature for detection. Our data shows that the types of skimmers we examined are indeed being found in the field.

### Discovery of Skimmers

According to our contacts, most skimmers are discovered during routine inspections by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. However, some reports noted the initial discoverers:
- "Discovered by technician" (37 comments)
- "Discovered by facility" (26 comments)
- "Discovered by law enforcement" (4 comments)
- "Discovered by consumer" (3 comments)

Gas pumps are not always managed by the facility's operators, and the business structure (leasing, contracting, etc.) is outside the scope of this paper. We categorized phrases like "Skimmer found by owner during routing inspection/Properly placed security tape" (446) as "discovered by facility" and "Pumps have properly placed security tape/skimmers found by Pump Tech" (542) as "discovered by technician" to capture these distinct groups.

### Limitations of the Data

To the best of our knowledge, this data represents the most comprehensive aggregate data for detected skimmers. However, it has several limitations:
- All fields are human-generated free responses.
- Some entries record data about multiple skimmers or multiple pumps at the same facility.
- The entries do not provide an exhaustive description of the skimmers or security measures.
- As this dataset spans a long period, the method of data entry or interpretation may have changed over time.
- The data reflects conditions when skimmers were found, not when they were installed. This means that seals and other controls might have been applied after the skimmer was installed, highlighting the issue of inadequate pump checks before sealing.

Given these limitations, we analyzed the data as provided, and it highlights the real-world challenges in protecting gas pumps against skimmers.

### Lessons Learned

In this section, we characterized the only visible security indicator available to consumers for detecting gas pump tampering: tamper-evident seals. These seals are the least expensive and easiest to deploy by businesses. We defined the properties that must be evaluated: presence, placement, intent, identity, and indication. Our analysis of over three years of aggregate data from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services showed that seals are the most frequent security control used on pumps. On pumps where skimmers have been discovered, they are often found with security seals in place. Attacks are reported on four out of five characteristics that must be evaluated on a seal, creating further difficulty in evaluating these seals. Ultimately, these seals do not indicate the presence of a skimmer and are easily evaded by adversaries.

### Discussion

Our analyses of current skimmer detection applications show that the possible detection methods are limited and cannot provide consumers with accurate tools to detect skimming devices. Even with similar constructions, skimmers can vary in methods of data retrieval, and no characteristic can be guaranteed for detection. As long as skimmer detection apps rely on methods such as Bluetooth scanning, MAC address recognition, and blacklists, they will remain ineffective, leaving consumers vulnerable.

Tamper-evident seals, while commonly used, are also ineffective in helping consumers detect skimming. The seals used at North American gas stations often differ by fuel brand, seal brand, station owner, and placement. We observed municipal pump seals, branded seals, and generic seals, all in various sizes, colors, and fonts. Some have serial numbers; others do not. Multiple styles of seals on the same pump further complicate consumer evaluation. Inconsistencies in seal presence, placement, and identity prevent successful consumer evaluation, and resolving these would be a partial solution at best.

### Countermeasures

**Use Another Required Security Measure/Deprecate Seals:**
In Florida, operators are generally required to deploy tamper-evident seals, a device that disables the terminal when opened, or an encrypting card reader. Our data shows that tamper-evident seals are overwhelmingly the only control reported present when skimmers are found. Neither disabling devices nor encrypting card readers appeared in reports, suggesting that either these devices are effective or not in use.

Anti-tampering equipment to electronically disable a terminal when opened is common practice among PIN Entry Devices (PEDs). However, it is unclear if adding these devices to gas pumps is financially feasible or how store operators with a single on-site employee would handle false positives. Insider threats are also problematic. If a malicious employee can re-enable the pump, the disabling device will not be effective. Therefore, these devices require new processes and handling to work. Encrypting card readers also require additional care in deployment, including key management and back-end processing, which may complicate deployment for small businesses.

The correct deployment of either of these technologies effectively renders internal skimmers useless. A disabled pump cannot accept cards, and an encrypting reader does not transmit sensitive account data as plaintext. This would make external (i.e., overlay and deep-insert) skimmers the simplest attack at gas pumps. We recommend the removal of tamper-evident seals as a sufficient security measure from existing or future regulation.

**Invest in Alternative Payment Mechanisms:**
Given the prevalence of smartphones (which increasingly offer NFC payment mechanisms), it may be advantageous for merchants to invest in wireless payment mechanisms. These technologies typically do not use static account data, reducing the viability of skimming attacks. The apps used for these payments offer fast updates without further hardware updates, which may avoid costly upgrades. However, these mechanisms are not inclusive. Users need to own a smartphone that supports such payment methods, and not all people have such a device or may choose not to use it. Gas pumps would still need to support card payments, resulting in skimmers remaining a problem. Additionally, malicious terminals are often not considered in attack models for payment systems (and can be exploited in EMV). Given the difficulty operators have securing existing pumps, achieving the needed level of trust with existing technology may be challenging. More work is needed to develop strong controls for wireless pay-at-the-pump technology.

Due to the financial constraints regarding replacing existing terminal hardware, this approach is only viable if there is sufficient consumer demand. The initial deployment of pay-at-the-pump technology took approximately two decades to reach ubiquity and was likely driven by consumer demand for a more convenient payment mechanism. Without such demand, terminal replacements seem unlikely without authoritative force (e.g., regulation or contractual obligation) or subsidies/discounts to lower the financial burden on businesses. We suspect that force without financial assistance could result in the closure of stores that cannot afford new technology. We recommend that future research into new payment mechanisms consider deployment cost as a feature and that regulators consider how these changes will affect businesses.

**Interrupt the Payment Workflow:**
Other research suggests that interrupting the payment workflow may be successful in bringing consumers' attention to security indicators. An on-screen message could display an image of a correct seal, the seal’s serial number, and require acknowledgment (e.g., inputting the serial number on the seal) before proceeding. Such a system could be deployed as a software update to existing hardware, though many existing pumps allow the consumer to begin the transaction by inserting their payment card, which might render a system like this ineffective at preventing skimming. While users might be unwilling to accept an interrupted payment flow, it may be possible to use human interaction to detect tampering similarly to other problems in our community. However, even with additional consumer awareness and individually-numbered seals, attackers would likely adjust their replacement seals to match the on-screen instructions. Therefore, we do not recommend this mechanism but note it here for completeness.

### Summary

We believe the fastest and most cost-effective solution is to physically enhance the security of gas pumps to deny attackers access to the inside of the unit. Though such security mechanisms for gas pumps are not yet widespread, similar technologies already exist for other payment terminals and should be explored before relying on human-based checks for detection.

### Related Work

Research in security indicators largely focuses on the interaction between the indicators and the user base. This is most prevalent in web browsers, where visual messaging is critical to informing users of threats to their online safety. Experiments show that users notice these indicators less frequently unless their task is interrupted. Similarly, research has demonstrated that while many webcams use indicators (e.g., lights), they are largely unnoticed until an obvious, red indicator is overlaid onto the user’s display.

Security indicators are also critical to physical assets, including those in healthcare, voting machines, and payment devices. Tamper-evident seals are intended to convey information about the confidentiality or integrity of an enclosure. Johnston analyzed hundreds of seal designs and found the median time to successfully attack (defeat or spoof) a seal was 43 seconds, with a cost of less than one dollar for subsequent attacks. Our research expands this work by exploring these seals when applied to payment systems (specifically, the task of buying fuel).

Payment systems fraud detection research primarily focuses on deciding whether to allow a transaction at the time it occurs. This type of analysis reduces magnetic stripe fraud but ignores issues of both illegitimate encoding of correct card data and data acquisition. MagnePrint attempts to resolve the former by measuring a card’s magnetic material at manufacture and verifying the measurement upon card use. Since this system requires a priori measurement, it cannot be used to verify previously-issued cards. To address this, Scaife et al. developed a system for using the encoding jitter of the data to distinguish counterfeit writes from originals without needing a measurement during manufacturing. Characterization of skimming attacks has also led to techniques capable of detecting multiple card readers (i.e., overlay and deep-insert skimmers). These techniques do not apply to other types of skimmers, such as the internal ones predominantly found inside gas pumps. Furthermore, while recent technologies such as EMV payment cards have made duplication more difficult, this has largely moved attacks further into the payment terminal. Understanding the detectability of attacks on customer-facing terminals is therefore critical to improving payment systems security.

### Conclusion

Our comprehensive analysis provides strong evidence that consumers have not been given the tools necessary to protect themselves against fraud at the pump. We showed that while skimmer detection apps are available for the most popular mobile platforms, few can detect any skimmers at all. Moreover, through a forensic analysis of actual skimmers recovered by law enforcement, we demonstrate that those apps that can detect skimmers can trivially be evaded. Finally, through the most comprehensive analysis of skimmers discovered over the course of nearly four years, we show that anti-theft mechanisms such as tamper-evident seals provide little impediment to criminals. Simply arguing that deploying EMV solves the problem ignores the massive expenses and logistical challenges facing the industry; rather, a coordinated effort to protect consumers and reduce fraud must be undertaken.
