User: Any ideas how I can display an image file (bmp or png) centered on the screen as an application splash screen when running a Windows console script based on a batch file, vbscript/wscript or Python console script?
I'm not interested in a wxPython solution - that's too much overhead just to implement a cosmetic feature like a splash screen.
Thank you,
Malcolm
Assistant: Try TK, it is included with python.  Also, PyGtk is lighter than wxPython, but I ended up bitting the bullet and using wxPython for the same purpose recently, it is heavy, but it didn't have any affect on the script performance.
