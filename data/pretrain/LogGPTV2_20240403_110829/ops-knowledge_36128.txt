User: Please introduce some commonly used Linux system monitoring tools and explain their purpose.
Assistant: 1. top: A tool for monitoring system processes, which can display running processes, CPU usage, memory usage, etc. in real time. 2. htop: similar to top, but with more features and an interactive interface. You can view the status of the process more intuitively, and also support dynamic sorting. 3. iostat: A tool for monitoring system I/O performance, which can display real-time statistics of disk I/O operations, including response time, transmission rate, etc. 4. iftop: A tool for real-time monitoring of network traffic, which can track and analyze traffic for different ports and IP addresses, which is very helpful for network fault location. 5. nmon: A tool for collecting system performance data and capacity planning data. It can monitor resources such as CPU, memory, network, and disk, and supports dynamic drawing of charts and exporting data. 6. sar: A tool that provides historical data and trend analysis of system performance. It can collect various statistical data such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, and also supports visual graphical reports. 7. vmstat: A comprehensive system monitoring tool that can display the overall system performance indicators in real time, such as the usage of CPU, memory, disk, and swap space. 8. netstat: A tool for monitoring the network connection status of the system, which can display the network connection status and the PID of the connection process, as well as port status, routing table and other information. 9. tcpdump: A network packet analysis tool that can capture and display packets in network traffic, including protocol type, source IP address, destination IP address, transmission direction, etc. 10. ping: A commonly used network connectivity testing tool, it can test whether the target host can be connected, and display the response delay and packet loss.
