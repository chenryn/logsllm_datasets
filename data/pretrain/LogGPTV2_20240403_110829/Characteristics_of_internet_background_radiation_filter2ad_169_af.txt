## Table 9: 24 Hours of Multi-Port Source Activity at the Four Sites

The table above shows the multi-port source activity over a 24-hour period. The profiles are ordered based on the ranks of all multi-port profiles collected at the UW I network, which showed the greatest affinity to Agobot. Several notable observations can be made:

1. **Spatial Invariance**: The top two exploits, Xi.exe (W32-Xibo) and NB-EP1, are extensively observed across all four networks, and their rankings are consistent in the Class B networks.
2. **Network Size and Activity**: Despite the LBL network being much smaller, it observes the same number of sources as the other two UW networks for the top three exploits. This suggests that these multi-port sources often sweep the address space.
3. **Agobot Scans**: UW I receives many more Agobot scans than the other networks, though the reason is unclear.

### Detailed Analysis of Agobot Scans

Figure 12 provides a detailed analysis of Agobot scans, showing the volume of unique sources per hour on several Agobot ports during a five-day period in March at the two adjacent UW networks. The graph at UW I shows four visible spikes, indicating an Agobot attack. While the background radiation at UW II closely follows UW I, these Agobot spikes are absent. The graphs also provide a temporal perspective on the growth of Agobot, with a striking daily spike-followed-by-decay pattern, presumably as new machines are cleaned up over the course of the day.

### Maturity of Agobot

We observe little Agobot activity on the Class A network. This likely reflects Agobot's "maturity" as malware. It has undergone iterative enhancements and may have evolved to avoid detection by telescopes. Alternatively, it may have a list of target networks or is being consciously focused by a human operator via IRC control channels.

## Table 10: Traffic from Sources Seen Across Networks: Intersections vs. Individual Networks

| Activity | All | Srch+Loc | Samr-exe | Witty |
|----------|-----|----------|----------|-------|
| LBL | 31K | 276K | 2,111 | 1,601 |
| UW Class A | 582K | 57% | 2,012 | 162 |
| LBL ∩ UW | 15K | 75% | 1,634 | 61 |
| LBL ∩ Class A | 6.5K | 91% | 116 | 18 |

### Sources Seen Across Networks

We now consider sets of source hosts seen on multiple networks at approximately the same time. We analyze source IPs seen across networks on an arbitrarily chosen day (Mar 22 GMT), characterizing them in terms of:

1. **Number of Source Hosts**: How many such source hosts are there?
2. **Traffic Consistency**: Do they send the same traffic to different networks?
3. **Activity Distribution**: What does the activity distribution look like?
4. **Comparison with Individual Networks**: How does it compare to the distribution on individual networks?

As shown in Table 10, source IPs seen at LBL and UW have a surprisingly large intersection set—almost half the source IPs seen at LBL are also seen at UW. In contrast, the intersection of LBL and the Class A is much smaller, even though we are seeing many more source IPs at the Class A than at UW. This contrast may be due to some sources avoiding the Class A networks and the proximity of LBL and UW in the IP address space.

## Table 11: Traffic from Sources Seen Over Time: Intersections vs. Individual Periods

| Activity | Mar 29 | Mar 30 | Apr 29 | 1-Day ∩ 1-Month ∩ |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------------------|
| All | 62K | 31K | 30K | 680 |
| Srch+Loc | 42% | 76% | 83% | 85% |
| Witty | 0 | 72 | 64 | 0 |
| Blaster | 24 | 30 | 31 | 7 |

### Sources Seen Over Time

To characterize sources seen at the same network over time, we analyze activity seen at LBL on three days: March 29, March 30, and April 29. This gives us comparisons for adjacent days and one month apart, respectively. Table 11 characterizes the variation. We see that the intersection of source hosts—even in the case of only one day apart—is much smaller than the intersection across networks. While this is partly because the UW network is larger than LBL, looking at the set of sources seen on another LBL network of the same size on March 29, we find more than 5,000 hosts in common. This confirms that we tend to see a larger intersection of source IPs across networks than over time. One effect we have not controlled for here, however, is DHCP artifacts: a host might be assigned different addresses on different days. We also note that one month’s time does not greatly further reduce the intersection size, suggesting that if a host does not have the DHCP artifact, then it tends to stay in the intersection. The initial steep decaying of source IP sets also suggests that it will be easier to track a (malicious) host across space than across time.

### Summary

Previous studies of Internet traffic have identified well-established properties such as diurnal cycles in volume, variability in mix across sites and over time, bursty arrivals, and the ubiquity of heavy-tailed distributions. However, a new dimension of Internet traffic has emerged, characterized by its complexity, automation, frequent maliciousness, potential adversarial nature, and rapid mutation. Each of these characteristics motivates the need for a deeper understanding of this "unwanted" traffic.

We have presented an initial study of the broad characteristics of Internet background radiation. Our evaluation is based on traffic measurements from four large, unused subnets within the IPv4 address space. We developed filtering techniques and active responders to use in our monitoring, analyzing both the characteristics of completely unsolicited traffic (passive analysis) and the details of traffic elicited by our active responses (activities analysis).

**Passive Analysis**:
- Demonstrates the prevalence and variability of background radiation.
- Reveals that the vast majority of traffic targets services with frequently-exploited vulnerabilities.
- Shows the overall dominance of TCP SYN-ACK/RST packets in backscatter traffic.

**Activities Analysis**:
- Focuses on the most popular services targeted by background radiation.
- Finds a rich variegation, including new worms, vestiges of old worms, autorooter scans, and empty connections.
- Highlights significant diversity across the monitored subnets and over time.

**Source Host Behavior**:
- Reveals consistent behavior in each of the measurement sites for the most prevalent multi-port scan type.
- Shows an appreciable intersection of sources across measurement sites, which can be explained by the random scanning behavior of worms like Welchia.
- Indicates a much smaller set of sources common to all measurement sites when considered over time.

**Dynamism in Background Radiation**:
- Unlike benign traffic, the mix of background radiation sometimes changes on a nearly-daily basis.
- Results in a potpourri of connection-level behavior, packet payloads, and activity sessions seen in different regions of the address space.

Our efforts have implications for both the research and operational communities. The ubiquity of background radiation presents significant difficulties for those who monitor Internet traffic, clogging stateful analyzers with uninteresting activity and complicating the detection of new types of activity. Further work is needed to assess the evolution of background radiation over time and to develop more detailed characterizations.
