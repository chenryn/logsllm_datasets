##### Detailed description
Intel's Inference Engine supports asynchronous forward passes using multiple
inference requests. Let users enable async. networks inference.
#### Initial proposal
  * Requires adding a new method `Net::enableAsync(bool)` to specify if we want to execute network asynchronously.
  * `Net::setInput` is used to set input data in the internal inputs queue and `Net::forward` to retrieve outputs in the same order.
  * `Net::forward` returns an empty Mat in case of output is not ready => User need to check that output is not empty.
Considered scenarios of Net in async mode:
##### Standard loop
    net.enableAsync(1);
    net.setInput(inp1);
    out1 = net.forward();
    net.setInput(inp2);
    out = net.forward();  // out is output for inp1 if out1 is empty. Otherwise it's output for inp2
    ...
This way user should store inputs and pop them by ready outputs (i.e. render
detections).
##### Prefetch
    net.enableAsync(1);
    net.setInput(inp1);
    net.setInput(inp2);
    ...
    out1 = net.forward();
    out = net.forward();  // out is output for inp1 if out1 is empty. Otherwise it's output for inp2
##### Syncing
    net.enableAsync(1);
    net.setInput(inp1);
    out = net.forward();  // assume out is empty here (not ready)
    out = net.forward();  // assume out is not ready again
    net.enableAsync(0);
    out = net.forward();  // wait here until output is ready
Syncing let users control maximum number of asynchronous requests. In example,
if number of fetched inputs equals to specified maximum number of requests, we
disable async mode and wait for the output of the first input in queue. Note
that it doen't disable asynchronous computations at that time but specifies
that next `Net::forward` invocation should return output.
