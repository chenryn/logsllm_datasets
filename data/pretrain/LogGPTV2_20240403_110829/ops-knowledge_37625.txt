User: I'm trying to run an external, separate program from Python. It wouldn't be a problem normally, but the program is a game, and has a Python interpreter built into it. When I use subprocess.Popen, it starts the separate program, but does so under the original program's Python instance, so that they share the first Python console. I can end the first program fine, but I would rather have separate consoles (mainly because I have the console start off hidden, but it gets shown when I start the program from Python with subprocess.POpen).
I would like it if I could start the second program wholly on its own, as though I just 'double-clicked on it'. Also, os.system won't work because I'm aiming for cross-platform compatibility, and that's only available on Windows.

Incorrect.

... so that they share the first Python console.

This is the crux of your problem. If you want it to run in another console then you must run another console and tell it to run your program instead.

... I'm aiming for cross-platform compatibility ...

Sorry, there's no cross-platform way to do it. You'll need to run the console/terminal appropriate for the platform.
