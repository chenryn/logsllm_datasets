For example, to copy the local file myFile.txt to the folder /myFolder on the remote server, the following command can be used: ``` scp myFile.txt user@remotehost:/myFolder ``` This command will copy myFile.txt to In the /myFolder directory of the remote server, you need to enter the password of the remote host at the same time. 2.
