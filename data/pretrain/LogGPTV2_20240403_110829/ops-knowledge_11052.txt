User: I'm trying to work out if it is possible to use Google Apps Scripts inside Google App Engine?
And if there is a tutorial in doing this out there ? 
Through reading Google's App Script site I get the feeling that you can only use app scripts inside Google Apps like Drive, Docs etc? 
What I would like to do is to be able to use the Groups Service that is in GAS inside GAE to Create, delete and only show the groups that a person is in, all inside my GAE App.
Thanks
Assistant: No you can't. AS and GAE are totally different things and won't work together.
What you can really do is (abstract):

write an AS that does what you need
redirect from GAE to the AS url to make sure that the user logs-in/grants permissions.
perform what you needed to do with AS
send back the user to GAE with a bunch of parameters if you need to
