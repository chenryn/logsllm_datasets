I am exploring the possibility of using Google Apps Script (GAS) within Google App Engine (GAE). Is there a tutorial available that explains how to do this?

From my understanding of the Google Apps Script documentation, it seems that GAS is primarily designed for use within Google Workspace applications like Drive, Docs, etc. 

My goal is to utilize the Groups Service available in GAS within my GAE application. Specifically, I want to create, delete, and display only the groups that a user is a part of, all within my GAE app.

Thank you for your help.

**Response:**

Unfortunately, Google Apps Script (GAS) and Google App Engine (GAE) are distinct platforms and cannot be directly integrated. However, you can achieve your goal by following these steps:

1. **Write a Google Apps Script**: Develop a script that performs the necessary operations, such as creating, deleting, and listing groups.
2. **Redirect from GAE to the GAS URL**: From your GAE application, redirect the user to the GAS script's URL. This ensures that the user logs in and grants the necessary permissions.
3. **Execute the GAS Script**: The script will perform the required actions using the Groups Service.
4. **Return to GAE with Parameters**: After the script execution, redirect the user back to your GAE application, passing any necessary parameters.

This approach allows you to leverage the capabilities of both platforms while maintaining a seamless user experience.
