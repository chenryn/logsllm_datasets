User: How to switch a database server from the master server to the slave server to meet the high availability design requirements of the database?
Assistant: The following are the steps to switch the database server from the master server to the slave server: 1. First, ensure that the slave server has synchronized the latest data with the master server to avoid data inconsistency. 2. Execute the FLUSH LOGS statement on the primary server. This command will forcefully flush the log files on the primary server to disk. 3. Then execute the STOP SLAVE statement on the slave server, which will stop the replication process of the slave server for master-slave switching. 4. Then execute the CHANGE MASTER TO statement on the slave server to convert the slave server into the new master server. This statement needs to specify information such as the IP address, port number, user name, and password of the new master server. 5. Finally, execute the START SLAVE statement on the slave server, which will restart the replication process of the slave server and start synchronizing data with other slave servers. After completing the above steps, the original master server becomes the slave server, and the original slave server becomes the new master server. In this way, the high-availability design requirements of the database can be realized, and the slave server can automatically switch and continue to provide services when the master server fails.
