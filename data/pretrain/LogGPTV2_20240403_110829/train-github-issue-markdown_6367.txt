While attempting to compile a simple program (available at <https://gist.github.com/darkstalker/c8c605ddc56aa4d31fc8>), which utilizes the `num` crate version 0.1.24, I encountered the following internal compiler error:

```
error: internal compiler error: Impl DefId { krate: 2, node: 24906 } was matchable against Obligation(predicate=Binder(TraitPredicate(core::ops::Mul)), depth=1) but now is not

note: the compiler unexpectedly panicked. This is a bug.
note: we would appreciate a bug report: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports>
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace
thread 'rustc' panicked at 'Box', /home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/beta-dist-rustc-linux/build/src/libsyntax/diagnostic.rs:209
```

The stack trace and the version of `rustc` can be found here: <https://gist.github.com/darkstalker/f4ce878d18a4f5c489d7>

This error suggests that there is an issue with the Rust compiler, and it would be helpful if you could submit a bug report as indicated. Additionally, running the compiler with the `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable will provide more detailed information about the crash, which may be useful for debugging.
