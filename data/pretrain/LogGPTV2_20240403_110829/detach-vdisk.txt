### Detach VDisk

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `detach vdisk` command stops the selected virtual hard disk (VHD) from appearing as a local hard disk drive on the host computer. Once detached, the VHD can be copied to other locations. Before executing this command, you must first select the VHD using the `select vdisk` command.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
detach vdisk [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **noerr**: (Optional) This parameter is intended for scripting purposes. When an error is encountered, DiskPart will continue to process subsequent commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**

To detach the selected VHD, type:
```plaintext
detach vdisk
```

**Steps to Detach a VHD:**
1. Open the DiskPart utility.
2. Select the VHD you want to detach using the `select vdisk` command.
3. Execute the `detach vdisk` command to remove the VHD from the host system.

This command is useful when you need to move or copy a VHD to another location without interrupting the current system operations.
