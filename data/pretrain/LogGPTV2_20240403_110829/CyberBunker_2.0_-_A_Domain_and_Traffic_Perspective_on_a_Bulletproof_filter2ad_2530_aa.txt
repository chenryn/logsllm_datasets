ABSTRACT
In September 2019, 600 armed German cops seized the physical
premise of a Bulletproof Hoster (BPH) referred to as CyberBunker
2.0. The hoster resided in a decommissioned NATO bunker and
advertised to host everything but child porn and anything related
to terrorism while keeping servers online no matter what. While
the anatomy, economics and interconnection-level characteristics
of BPHs are studied, their traffic characteristics are unknown. In
this poster, we present the first analysis of domains, web pages, and
traffic captured at a major tier-1 ISP and a large IXP at the time
when the CyberBunker was in operation. Our study sheds light
on traffic characteristics of a BPH in operation. We show that a
traditional BGP-based BPH identification approach cannot detect
the CyberBunker, but find characteristics from a domain and traffic
perspective that can add to future identification approaches.

1 MOTIVATION AND RELATED WORK
Cybercrime relies on infrastructures to host their services. One
class of such infrastructures are hosting providers that promise
protection, e.g., against law enforcement agencies, referred to as
BPH. They allow cybercriminals to host any content or service
while ignoring abuse messages and keeping services online.
A classical example are monolithic BPHs which hold their own
IP space. Due to abuse generated by the hosted services, they can
be detected by reputation based methods such as BGP Ranking [13]
and frequent changes in the used upstream providers (e.g., due to
contract terminations following abuse complaints) by analyzing
BGP routing data [6]. To avoid blacklisting, some BPH changed

their business model and evolved by abusing legitimate hosting
providers [3]. This new class of so called agile BPH can be detected
by using whois snapshots and passive DNS data [1]. In May 2018,
the agile BPH Maxided has been taken down by Dutch and Thai law
enforcement agencies. The confiscated data enabled to understand
the anatomy and economics of these BPH [9]. While the anatomy,
economics, and interconnection-level characteristics of BPHs are
studied, the characteristics of the generated Internet traffic are still
unknown—an aspect on which this poster aims to shed light.
The CyberBunker 2.0 is a recent and prominent example of a
monolithic BPH; a hoster that resided in a decommissioned NATO
bunker in Germany since 2013. It advertised its service to host
everything but “child porn and anything related to terrorism” while
“keeping servers online no matter what”, see their Stay Online
Policy [2]. The CyberBunker was accused to be involved in hosting
illegal Internet services, see the indictment by the prosecutor [5].
Examples include the darknet marketplace “Flugsvamp”, which
allegedly covered around 90% of the Swedish online drug trade [5].
In September 2019, 600 armed German cops seized the physical
premise of the CyberBunker [11]. A post-mortem analysis [7] after
the take down confirms the hosting of (C&C) servers infrastructure
for multiple botnets. This renders the CyberBunker as an interesting
example for studying properties of BPH.
In this poster, we aim at closing this gap by presenting the first
analysis of domains, web page contents, and traffic captured at a
major tier-1 ISP and an IXP at the time when the CyberBunker
was in operation. Our study sheds light on traffic characteristics
of a bullet proof hoster in operation. We show that a BGP-based
BPH identification approach would not detect the CyberBunker
and find characteristics from our traffic perspective that adds to
our understanding of this type of BPHs.
2 IDENTIFYING THE CYBERBUNKER
Identifying CyberBunker IP space. We begin by using historic
DNS data (see § 3.1) to obtain IP addresses for three domains claimed
to be hosted by the CyberBunker in the indictment by the pros-
ecutor [5]: www.orangechemicals.com, www.acechemstore.com,
and www.lifestylepharma.com (all accused for hosting shops of-
fering narcotics and synthetic drugs). For all domains we find A
resource records pointing to IP prefix B (AS62454 - “ZYZTM”) in the
time the CyberBunker was active. A follow-up query in archived
Spamhaus’s Block List (SBL) [12] database for the ZYZTM network
yield two further prefixes A and C. The SBL entries state the “Hoster
known to Spamhaus to be/have been involved in hosting several
known professional spammers and also cybercriminal types” [12].
We show all identified prefixes, their ASN, and upstream provider
(from BGP data 2013-2019) in Table 1. A post-mortem analysis of

of these prefixes. We therefore base our analysis on the IP prefixes.

Routing perspective. Prior work [6] observed BPHs to frequently
change/cycle their upstream providers due to abuse. These changes
of upstream providers (“re-wiring”) are observable in inter-domain
routing by analyzing BGP data [6]. We are therefore interested if
re-wiring activity could have been used to detect the CyberBunker.
For each prefix A, B, and C, we query all routing tables that are
archived every 8 hours by RIPE route collectors [8] using BGP-
stream. We use all RIBs collected by route collector rrc00 (RIPE
Amsterdam), rrc06 (Otemachi, Japan), rrc11 (New York, USA),
rrc12 (Frankfurt, Germany), and rrc24 (entire LACNIC region) in
the period from June 2013 till September 2019 (take down). We find
no signs for re-wiring for all three prefixes, i.e., all announced AS
paths continuously feature the same upstream ASes.
3 DOMAIN AND WEB PERSPECTIVE
We first take a domain perspective on the CyberBunker. This per-
spective enables us to understand which web sites were hosted
by the CyberBunker. We analyze historic DNS data and extract
A resource records that point to CyberBunker IP prefixes (i.e.,
www.domain.tld → CyberBunker IP). The resulting list of domains
enables us to later classify the content of the web sites.
3.1 Domain Perspective
DNS data set. We rely on weekly DNS resolutions of all ≈ 200 M
registered .com/net/org/... domains from DNS zone files [4] and
performing DNS resolutions during 2016 and 2019 (CyberBunker
take down). This data contains A RR queries to domain.tld and
www.domain.tld. We extract all entries where the A RR points to
an IP address included in one of the three CyberBunker IP prefixes.
Domain perspective. In total we obtain 1,159 domains from 52
different TLDs where 980 (85%) domains belong to .com. These do-
mains are located on 207 different IP addresses from CyberBunkers
IP space. Figure 1 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function
(CDF) for the number of domains for each used IP address. Only
18 IP addresses are used for hosting nearly 70% of the identified
domains. One single IP address is used for hosting of 372 domains.
This analysis shows, that few IPs host the bulk of the domains and
opens the question on which content is being hosted.

3.2 Content Perspective
Next, we aim to understand which content was offered by web
sites provided at the previously identified domains. To answer this
question, we first obtain historic snapshots (if available) for each
domain and then manually classify the content of the landing page.
Since we are only interested in the offered content in the period in
which the CyberBunker was active (2013-2019), no current crawls
