## Abstract
In September 2019, 600 armed German police officers seized the physical premises of a bulletproof hoster (BPH) known as CyberBunker 2.0. The BPH was located in a decommissioned NATO bunker and advertised its services to host any content except child pornography and terrorism-related material, with a commitment to keep servers online under all circumstances. While previous studies have examined the anatomy, economics, and interconnection-level characteristics of BPHs, their traffic characteristics remain largely unexplored. This poster presents the first analysis of domains, web pages, and traffic captured at a major tier-1 ISP and a large Internet Exchange Point (IXP) during the operational period of CyberBunker 2.0. Our findings highlight the unique traffic characteristics of a BPH in operation and demonstrate that traditional BGP-based BPH identification methods are insufficient for detecting CyberBunker 2.0. We identify specific domain and traffic characteristics that can enhance future BPH detection approaches.

## 1. Motivation and Related Work
Cybercriminals rely on hosting infrastructures that provide protection against law enforcement, known as bulletproof hosters (BPHs). These BPHs allow the hosting of any content or service while ignoring abuse messages and ensuring continuous uptime. Traditional BPHs, often monolithic, maintain their own IP space and can be detected through reputation-based methods like BGP Ranking [13] and frequent changes in upstream providers due to abuse complaints [6]. To avoid blacklisting, some BPHs have evolved into agile BPHs by abusing legitimate hosting providers [3], which can be detected using WHOIS snapshots and passive DNS data [1]. For example, the agile BPH Maxided was taken down in May 2018, providing insights into the anatomy and economics of such operations [9].

The CyberBunker 2.0 is a recent and prominent example of a monolithic BPH, operating from a decommissioned NATO bunker in Germany since 2013. It advertised its services to host "everything but child porn and anything related to terrorism" and committed to keeping servers online no matter what [2]. The CyberBunker was accused of hosting illegal internet services, including the darknet marketplace "Flugsvamp," which allegedly covered 90% of the Swedish online drug trade [5]. In September 2019, 600 armed German police officers seized the physical premises of the CyberBunker [11]. Post-mortem analysis confirmed the hosting of Command and Control (C&C) servers for multiple botnets [7], making the CyberBunker an interesting case study for BPH characteristics.

This poster aims to fill the gap in understanding the traffic characteristics of BPHs by presenting the first analysis of domains, web page contents, and traffic captured at a major tier-1 ISP and an IXP during the operational period of CyberBunker 2.0. Our study reveals that traditional BGP-based BPH identification methods would not detect the CyberBunker and identifies new characteristics from a domain and traffic perspective.

## 2. Identifying the CyberBunker
### 2.1 Identifying CyberBunker IP Space
We used historical DNS data to obtain IP addresses for three domains mentioned in the indictment: www.orangechemicals.com, www.acechemstore.com, and www.lifestylepharma.com. All these domains were accused of hosting shops offering narcotics and synthetic drugs. For each domain, we found A resource records pointing to IP prefix B (AS62454 - "ZYZTM") during the active period of the CyberBunker. Further queries in the Spamhaus Block List (SBL) database [12] identified two additional prefixes, A and C, associated with the ZYZTM network. The SBL entries indicated that the hoster was known to be involved in hosting professional spammers and cybercriminals. Table 1 summarizes the identified prefixes, their ASNs, and upstream providers.

| Prefix          | ASN   | Upstream ASes      |
|-----------------|-------|--------------------|
| 185.103.72.0/22 | 29090 | 13030              |
| 185.35.136.0/22 | 62454 | 9002 & 13030       |
| 91.209.12.0/24  | 51088 | 61180              |

A post-mortem analysis after the takedown [7] confirmed the usage of these prefixes, forming the basis for our analysis.

### 2.2 Routing Perspective
Previous research [6] observed that BPHs frequently change their upstream providers due to abuse, a phenomenon known as "re-wiring." We analyzed BGP data from RIPE route collectors [8] to determine if re-wiring activity could have been used to detect the CyberBunker. We queried all routing tables archived every 8 hours by RIPE route collectors (rrc00, rrc06, rrc11, rrc12, and rrc24) from June 2013 to September 2019. Our analysis revealed no signs of re-wiring for all three prefixes, indicating consistent upstream providers.

## 3. Domain and Web Perspective
### 3.1 Domain Perspective
To understand the websites hosted by the CyberBunker, we analyzed historical DNS data to extract A resource records pointing to the CyberBunker IP prefixes. This resulted in a list of 1,159 domains across 52 different TLDs, with 980 (85%) being .com domains. These domains were hosted on 207 different IP addresses within the CyberBunker's IP space. Figure 1 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the number of domains per IP address, revealing that 18 IP addresses hosted nearly 70% of the identified domains, with one IP address hosting 372 domains.

### 3.2 Content Perspective
To understand the content offered by the websites, we obtained historical snapshots (if available) for each domain and manually classified the landing page content. Since we were interested in the content offered during the CyberBunker's active period (2013-2019), we did not perform current crawls. This analysis provides insights into the types of content hosted by the CyberBunker.
