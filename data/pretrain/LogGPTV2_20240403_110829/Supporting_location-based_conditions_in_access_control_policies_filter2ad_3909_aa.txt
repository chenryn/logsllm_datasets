ABSTRACT
Location-based Access Control (LBAC) techniques allow tak-
ing users’ physical location into account when determining
their access privileges.
In this paper, we present an ap-
proach to LBAC aimed at integrating location-based condi-
tions along with a generic access control model, so that a
requestor can be granted or denied access by checking her
location as well as her credentials. Our LBAC model in-
cludes a novel way of taking into account the limitations
of the technology used to ascertain the location of the re-
quester. Namely, we describe how location veriﬁcation can
be encapsulated as a service, representing location technolo-
gies underlying it in terms of two semantically uniform ser-
vice level agreement (SLA) parameters called conﬁdence and
timeout. Based on these parameters, we present the formal
deﬁnition of a number of location-based predicates, their
management, evaluation, and enforcement. The challenges
that such an extension to traditional access control policies
inevitably carries are discussed also with reference to de-
tailed examples of LBAC policies.

INTRODUCTION
Conventional access control mechanisms rely on the as-
sumption that requestors’ proﬁles fully determine what they
are authorized to do. However, more generally, a requestor’s
proﬁle is not the only thing that matters: her physical loca-
tion may also play an important role in determining access
rights. Location-based Access Control (LBAC) is an intu-
itive concept: for example, being able to operate a mechan-
ical device located in a particular room requires having a
physical presence in that room. The very design of the de-
vice interface, including no remote control, is what enforces
the security policy. Achieving the same kind of guarantee
with software applications reachable via a telecommunica-
tion infrastructure like a wireless network requires a way to
perform location veriﬁcation, where a user’s location is se-
curely veriﬁed to meet certain criteria, for example, being
inside a speciﬁc room or within a geographical area. The
rapid development in the ﬁeld of wireless and mobile net-
working fostered a new generation of devices suitable for
being used as sensors by location technologies able to com-
pute the relative position and movement of users in their
working environment. Once a user’s location has been veri-
ﬁed using a protocol for location veriﬁcation, the user can be
granted access to a particular resource according to the de-
sired policy. The location veriﬁcation process must be able
to tolerate rapid context changes, because mobile users can
wander freely while initiating transactions by means of ter-
minal devices like cell phones (GSM and 3G) and palmtops
with wi-ﬁ cards. To this end, well known location sensing
techniques like the Global Positioning System (GPS) or tech-
niques based on measuring signal power losses or transmis-
sion delays between terminals and wireless base stations can
be exploited. Regardless of the speciﬁc technology, location
veriﬁcation can provide a rich context representation regard-
ing both the users and the resources they access. Location-
based information now potentially available to access control
modules include the position of the requestor when a certain
access request is submitted and the direction where she is
headed. In the near future, location-based services will pro-
vide a wealth of additional environment-related knowledge
(e.g., is the user sitting at her desk or walking toward the
door? is she alone or together with others?). This kind of
ﬁne-grained context information potentially supports a new
class of location-aware policy conditions regulating access to
and fruition of resources.
When evaluating location-aware conditions, however, we
need to consider that location-based information is radically
diﬀerent from other context-related knowledge inasmuch it
is both approximate (all location systems have a margin of
error) and time-variant (location is subject to fast changes,
especially when the user is in motion).
In this paper, we
put forward the idea of integrating location-based condi-
tions along with a generic access control model, so that a
requestor could be granted or denied access by validating
location-based credentials. We present the formal deﬁnition
of some location-based predicates, their management, eval-
uation, and enforcement. The challenges that such an ex-
tension to traditional access control policies inevitably car-
ries are discussed also with reference to detailed examples of
LBAC policies. Our approach to LBAC includes a novel way
of taking into account the speciﬁc techniques and algorithms
used to ascertain the location of the requester. We repre-
sent the underlying location technologies in terms of a set of
standard interfaces and semantically uniform service level
agreement (SLA) parameters called conﬁdence and time-
out. Speciﬁcally, we describe the interface between an access
policy evaluation engine and a Location Service. We then
show how the SLA parameters of a Location Service can be
taken into account by the Access Control Engine. Our solu-
tion fully addresses both uncertainty and time-dependency
of location-based information; furthermore, it has the abil-
ity to seamlessly integrate location-based and identity-based
access control, providing the exact level of security needed
for pervasive and distributed resources. Finally, our archi-
tecture is highly distributed and relies on external Web ser-
vices to perform functions like estimation of location of a
resource requestor.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 presents our location architecture and the basic con-
cepts introducing a location-based scenario. Section 3 for-
mally illustrates and deﬁnes location-based predicates. Sec-
tion 4 describes access control policies based on location
predicates, and Section 5 presents the working of the Access
Control Engine enforcing LBAC policies. Section 6 presents
related work. Finally, Section 7 gives our conclusions.
2. BASIC CONCEPTS AND REFERENCE
SCENARIO
We brieﬂy describe the reference location-based architec-
ture and some basic concepts on location-based systems.
2.1 Location-based architecture
In a LBAC architecture, there are more parties involved
than in conventional access control systems. Evaluation of
LBAC policies involves context data about location and tim-
ing that are made available by third parties through service
interfaces called Location Services. In other words, a LBAC
system evaluating a policy does not have direct access to
location information; rather, it sends location requests to
external services and waits for the corresponding answers.
The characteristics of these Location Services will depend on
the communication environment where the user transaction
takes place. Here, we focus on the mobile network, where
Location Services are provided by mobile phone operators.
Figure 1: Location-based Architecture
Our LBAC architecture involves the following three entities.
Requestor. The entity whose access request to a service
must be authorized by a LBAC system. We make
no assumption about requestors, besides the fact that
they carry terminals enabling authentication and some
form of location veriﬁcation.
Access Control Engine (ACE). The entity that imple-
ments the LBAC system used to enforce access control
to the available services. To evaluate access requests
according to some LBAC policies, ACE must commu-
nicate with a Location Service for acquiring location
information.
Location Service (LS). The entity that provides the lo-
cation information. The types of location requests that
it can satisfy depend on the speciﬁc mobile technology,
the methods applied for measuring users position, and
environmental conditions.
Figure 1 depicts the architecture schema.
Interactions
among the Requestor, the Access Control Engine, and the
Location Service is carried out via request/response message
exchanges. The Access Control Engine receives access re-
quests, evaluates policies and returns answers, invoking the
Location Service when necessary. This functional decom-
position is due to the fact that location functionalities are
fully encapsulated within remote services set up and man-
aged by the mobile operators. Therefore, no assumption can
be made on these services besides their interfaces.
2.2 Location-based conditions
Intuitively, a location-based condition is a condition in-
volving a predicate whose value depends on location mea-
surements performed by a Location Service. Location-based
predicates have been investigated since long by the wireless
network research community [1], trying to address critical
issues like time and space dependency. Two key issues are
speciﬁc to LBAC:
• interoperability: location tracking can rely on diﬀerent
sources of location information, depending on avail-
ability and cost;
• uncertainty: each location measure, which a Location
Service performs, has a degree of uncertainty due to
technological limitations and possible environmental
eﬀects.
While the former issue largely depends on roaming agree-
ments between mobile phone operators and is more business-
oriented in nature, the latter needs to be tackled eﬀectively

for LBAC to reach its goals. Today, in the mobile network
scenario, no technology is available ensuring fully exact user
location [13]. The location accuracy is always less than
100%, so normally a position is speciﬁed as a range, lo-
cating the user within a certain area.1 For a given location
request, this area cannot be set a priori; rather, it may
depend on the number of nearby antennas and on the sur-
rounding landscape features. Also, a location measurement
is often unstable because of changing environmental condi-
tions, such as reﬂection or interferences that may corrupt
the signal. In our model, we take into account these aspects
by assuming that the result provided by a Location Service
is always aﬀected by a measurement error. This fact is rel-
evant to the syntax and semantic of the Location Service
interface because the outcome of the evaluation of an access
request determined by the Access Control Engine will de-
pend on such an uncertainty, which must then be explicitly
represented and processed.
It is worth noting that performance-related properties of
a localization service largely depend on the underlying tech-
nology. We use GSM/3G technologies as our reference due
to their widespread usage and for recent advancements that
have sensibly improved location capabilities.2 Other tech-
nologies like 802.11 WiFi and AGPS/GPS [10, 22] could
also be exploited although some limitations reduce their ap-
plicability. WiFi, for example, has a limited coverage and
its usage is restricted to indoor environments (e.g., build-
ings, airports, malls) or in urban areas covered by many
hotspots. GPS, on the contrary, does not work indoor or
in narrow spaces but has no coverage limitation, a feature
which makes it an ideal location technology for open, out-
door environments. The main techniques used in GSM/3G
technology for location are the following.
Cell Identiﬁcation. It is the simplest technique and is
based on the identiﬁcation of the mobile terminal serv-
ing cell. The coordinates of the cell provide a broad
estimation of a user position, depending on the radius
of the cell, which can be comprised between 200 meters
and 2.5 kilometers. In towns, cells are much smaller
than in the countryside.
Signal Level. It is based on measuring the signal atten-
uation. Assuming free space propagation and omni-
directional antennas, signal level contours around a
base station are concentric circles where smaller cir-
cles enjoy more powerful signal. Directional antennas
lead to more complex geometrical shapes. Unless ad-
vanced (and computationally heavy) ray-tracing algo-
rithms are used, the signal level metric is not well-
suited indoor or for urban areas.
Angle of Arrival (AoA). It assumes that several base
stations are used for signal reception. A user position
can be calculated by computing the angle of arrival at
two base stations. Note, however, that if there is no
line-of-sight between the mobile terminal and the base
1Although elevation also counts, for the sake of simplicity
we disregard it in this paper. Our results can be readily
extended to incorporate 3D intervals, at the price of some
additional complexity.
2In cooperation with Siemens Mobile, our group has recently
patented a high-accuracy method for locating mobile phones
suitable for indoor environments [2].
stations, the calculated angle do not correspond with
the actual directional vector from the base station to
the mobile.
Time of Arrival (ToA). The distance between a base
station and a mobile phone is calculated by measuring
the time a signal takes to make a round-trip between
the two. Geometrically, this provides a circumference,
centered at the base station. If more than three base
stations are available, the intersection of their circles
provides a mobile phone position. However, signal ar-
rival can be delayed by walls or natural obstacles, de-
creasing location accuracy.
Time Diﬀerence of Arrival (TDoA). Assuming
that
base stations within the network are synchronized or
propagation delays between them are known, the dif-
ference between station-to-terminal propagation times
can be computed, increasing location accuracy. This
can either be realized by measuring the diﬀerences
between the arrival time of a certain burst sent by the
mobile to several base stations or by recording the
time diﬀerences of impinging signals at the mobile.
A positive aspect of all ﬁve location methods listed above
is that they do not require any modiﬁcation to existing
mobile networks. Their accuracy and measurement error,
however, may vary in diﬀerent environments. In particular,
TDoA and (enhanced) signal level methods are the most
accurate in urban and indoor environments while AoA is
well-suited for outdoor location because urban environments
involve refraction and reﬂection phenomena that may com-
promise its performance.
3. LOCATION-BASED CONDITIONS AND
PREDICATES
3.1 Expressing location-based conditions
A ﬁrst step to support location-based conditions in an au-
thorization language is to identify how location information
is queried and what kind of response the Location Service
returns. Traditional location-based services [16] usually as-
sume queries to the Location Service to be of the form of
range queries asking for an estimated range of values (pos-
sibly collapsing to a single value) for a predicate. Range
queries can be modeled as functions of the form:
predicate(parameters)→[range,accuracy,timeout]
stating that the evaluation of a location predicate over pa-
rameters returns a result of range. The range has a given ac-
curacy that represents the radius of the circular area, where
range is the center of such an area. Intuitively, range and
accuracy represents the area where a terminal is located.
The accuracy is therefore an upper bound of the deviation
with respect to the true location of the terminal, guaran-
teed by the Location Service3 and is to be considered valid
within the timeframe speciﬁed by the timeout. For the sake
of simplicity, in our model we consider queries to be of a
simpler (although largely equivalent) form; namely, we shall
