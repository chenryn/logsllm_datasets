ABSTRACT
Dynamic spectrum access networks are designed to allow today’s
bandwidth hungry “secondary devices” to share spectrum allocated
to legacy devices, or “primary users.” The success of this wire-
less communication model relies on the availability of unused spec-
trum, and the ability of secondary devices to utilize spectrum with-
out disrupting transmissions of primary users. While recent mea-
surement studies have shown that there is sufﬁcient underutilized
spectrum available, little is known about whether secondary de-
vices can efﬁciently make use of available spectrum while mini-
mizing disruptions to primary users.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst comprehensive study on the
presence of “usable” spectrum in opportunistic spectrum access
systems, and whether sufﬁcient spectrum can be extracted by sec-
ondary devices to support traditional networking applications. We
use for our study ﬁne-grain usage traces of a wide spectrum range
(20MHz–6GHz) taken at 4 locations in Germany, the Netherlands,
and Santa Barbara, California. Our study shows that on average,
54% of spectrum is never used and 26% is only partially used. Sur-
prisingly, in this 26% of partially used spectrum, secondary devices
can utilize very little spectrum using conservative access policies to
minimize interference with primary users. Even assuming an opti-
mal access scheme and extensive statistical knowledge of primary
user access patterns, a user can only extract between 20-30% of the
total available spectrum. To provide better spectrum availability,
we propose frequency bundling, where secondary devices build re-
liable channels by combining multiple unreliable frequencies into
virtual frequency bundles. Analyzing our traces, we ﬁnd that there
is little correlation of spectrum availability across channels, and
that bundling random channels together can provide sustained pe-
riods of reliable transmission with only short interruptions.

INTRODUCTION
Radio spectrum is perhaps the wireless industry’s most valuable
asset. The deployment and growth of any wireless network depend
on the amount of spectrum it can access. Despite its recognized
value, current policies on spectrum distribution are highly inefﬁ-
cient. Spectrum frequency ranges are assigned statically to wireless
carriers in long-term leases, generally ignoring market demands
that vary signiﬁcantly over time. Over the years, the large majority
of frequency ranges have been assigned, leaving little room for new
technologies or growth. Meanwhile, demands for previously as-
signed frequencies have dropped signiﬁcantly, leaving most ranges
woefully underutilized at an average of 5% of capacity [16].
Opportunistic and dynamic spectrum access is a new access model
designed to “extract” unused spectrum from allocated but under-
utilized frequencies, supporting newcomer trafﬁc without affecting
existing owners. In this model, wireless devices that need spectrum
locate and “opportunistically (re)use” unused frequencies ranges.
These “secondary” devices take great precaution to avoid disrupt-
ing original or “primary” users, and immediately exit the frequency
whenever they detect trafﬁc from primary users. Through this care-
fully planned access model, secondary devices can increase spec-
trum utilization with zero or bounded disruptions to existing own-
ers. Note that compared to more liberal spectrum access rules [11],
this “conservative” access model is easier to implement and much
more likely to gain acceptance with regulators and primary users.
The success of the dynamic spectrum access model depends heav-
ily on both the availability of unused spectrum, and whether sec-
ondary devices can efﬁciently extract and utilize them. While a
number of measurement studies have measured and modeled the
availability of unused spectrum [1, 5, 7, 13, 23, 24], the com-
munity has generally overlooked the second factor, and optimisti-
cally assumed that secondary devices can always efﬁciently utilize
available spectrum. Despite its importance, little is known about
151whether secondary devices can efﬁciently make use of available
spectrum, given the hard constraints of avoiding disruptions to pri-
mary users. This is understandable, since such a study requires ac-
cess to a ﬁne-grained measurement trace of spectrum usage, which
has not been available until recently.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst comprehensive study of per-
formance in opportunistic spectrum access systems that limit dis-
ruptions to unpredictable primary users. Our goal is to understand
whether dynamic spectrum access can provide reliable spectrum to
secondary users, while respecting hard disruption limits that protect
primary user transmissions. Our study can address key concerns
about the feasibility of supporting traditional network applications
in this new model. We answer questions in three key areas:
(1) How much usable spectrum is available at different frequency
ranges? How does this availability change across time and spec-
trum frequency?
(2) How much spectrum is accessible by conservative secondary
users who must avoid disrupting spectrum owners at all costs?
(3) Can we design novel spectrum access methods that allow us to
build a reliable wireless channel using unreliable dynamic spec-
trum channels?
We answer these questions by performing a deep analysis of a
large collection of spectrum usage measurements. These measure-
ments are taken from four locations across the globe: two in Ger-
many, one in the Netherlands, and one in Santa Barbara, USA. Each
measurement uses a spectrum analyzer to sweep a range of radio
frequencies between 20MHz and 6GHz for a period of 2–7 days,
capturing the raw energy level observed on each of the 200kHz fre-
quency channels at a periodic interval of 0.65 or 1.8 seconds. These
results capture, at a very ﬁne granularity, when speciﬁc radio fre-
quencies are occupied by primary users in the measurement area.
This dataset is unique in its combination of wide frequency cover-
age (20MHz to 6GHz), measurement length (one week for 3 of the
locations), and measurement frequency (one sweep per 1.8 or 0.65
seconds compared to 75 seconds of prior studies [7]). We extract
from them spectrum occupancy traces (occupied or free) across a
large set of frequencies, covering 5922 wireless channels and a total
of more than 5 billion data points for analysis. While four locations
are in no way representative of spectrum usage in general, these
measurements do provide initial insights into whether opportunistic
spectrum access has the potential to support traditional networking
applications.
Our analysis of spectrum availability (Section 3) conﬁrms that
most assigned frequencies are heavily underutilized. Out of 5922
channels analyzed, an average of 26% (or 1267 channels) were par-
tially occupied (5%–95% occupancy). We are primarily interested
in evaluating dynamic spectrum access on these channels, since
other channels are either fully occupied (20% of our dataset, or
1317 channels ), or can be statically allocated as free channels
(54%) of our dataset, or 3338 channels. We also observe that spec-
trum availability varies signiﬁcantly based on the frequency range
and measurement location. More importantly, short term availabil-
ity varies signiﬁcantly across time, and both idle duration and busy
periods show high variance. This highly variable spectrum avail-
ability poses signiﬁcant challenges to secondary devices, making it
harder to access and utilize a channel while respecting a ﬁxed limit
of disruptions to primary users.
In Section 4, we use these spectrum traces to compare the per-
formance of two “optimal” opportunistic access mechanisms: one
scheme where secondary devices have zero knowledge of primary
user patterns, and one where secondary devices have accurate sta-
tistical knowledge of the primary user accesses [14]. We are shocked
to ﬁnd that, even with accurate statistical knowledge of primary
user accesses, secondary devices can only extract 20–30% of the
available spectrum under a reasonable disruption limit of 10%, and
less than 10% of spectrum if the disruption limit drops to 1%. In ad-
dition, spectrum extracted from each channel is heavily fragmented
and scattered across time. As a result, the equivalent channels avail-
able to secondary devices are highly unreliable – spectrum access
on each channel is frequently interrupted, and often takes 10–100
seconds before being restored.
But there is hope. We propose and evaluate frequency bundling,
where secondary devices build reliable transmission channels by
combining together multiple unreliable frequencies, essentially uti-
lizing frequency diversity to compensate for the lack of reliabil-
ity on individual channels. To evaluate different bundling strate-
gies, we analyze correlation between availability patterns of differ-
ent 200kHz channels, and ﬁnd little or no correlation (Section 5).
This availability independence means that we can signiﬁcantly im-
prove overall reliability by simply bundling random channel pairs
together. Experimental results from our datasets are promising. Us-
ing a random bundling strategy, the improvement in channel relia-
bility scales exponentially with the size of the bundle. For example,
bundling 5–10 randomly selected channels together will reduce the
secondary device’s blocking time by two orders of magnitude. The
resulting new channel enjoys average transmission periods of 120–
1300s while being occasionally interrupted by 2-4s.
Finally, we wish to understand the impact of the sweeping fre-
quency parameter in our conclusions. Are our datasets sufﬁciently
ﬁne grain to capture the variability in primary user access patterns?
If so, then secondary devices can improve their spectrum utiliza-
tion simply by sensing and utilizing the channel at a ﬁner granu-
larity. We use the 2nd component of our dataset (collected locally
by us for this project) to test this theory. We ﬁnd that the varia-
tions in channel availability continue at ﬁner time scales, meaning
secondary devices cannot simply improve performance by working
at ﬁner time scales (Section 6). Using this dataset, we also exam-
ine potential artifacts of using coarse time scale for opportunistic
access.
In summary, our study provides a ﬁrst look into the feasibil-
ity of accessing spectrum opportunistically while respecting hard
limits to disruptions to primary users. We show that given the
unpredictable nature of primary user access, current spectrum ac-
cess methods cannot provide usable channels to secondary devices.
Only by bundling multiple unreliable channels together can we pro-
vide reasonable levels of reliability to network applications on these
devices. We also make several other observations:
• The performance of opportunistic spectrum access cannot
be determined solely from average spectrum availability, i.e.
higher availability does not necessarily mean more usable
spectrum.
• Statistical knowledge of spectrum occupancy can improve
the performance of opportunistic access by a factor of 2–3.
• Frequency channels (200kHz) are mostly uncorrelated, un-
less they are frequency-adjacent. This conﬂicts with a prior
measurement study [7]. The difference could be attributed to
the use of different energy detection methods, measurement
location and time granularity.
2. OVERVIEW
In this section, we ﬁrst provide background information on op-
portunistic spectrum access. We then describe the objectives of our
investigation and the datasets we use.
1522.1 Opportunistic Spectrum Access
Opportunistic spectrum access involves two entities: primary
users or original owners of allocated but underutilized frequencies,
and secondary users who seek to make use of unused spectrum, un-
der the hard constraints of avoiding disruptions to primary users at
all costs [3, 27, 14].
Figure 1 shows a representative example of opportunistic spec-
trum access on a partially used primary user channel. A secondary
user x accesses the channel using a slotted sensing-then-access
mechanism. At the start of each slot, x senses the channel to detect
whether any primary user is present, often using a RF energy de-
tection [10]. If the channel is occupied, x does nothing and waits
till the next slot. If the channel appears to be unused, x will decide
whether to access the channel in the current slot. In order to satisfy
hard primary user disruption limits, x must carefully access the risk
of using the channel because the primary user can potentially return
in the middle of its transmission slot. When necessary, x will give
up using an idle channel to avoid disrupting the original owner.
2.2 Goals
By analyzing real world measurements on primary user spec-
trum usage patterns, we have three key goals. First, we wish to un-
derstand the feasibility and effectiveness of opportunistic spectrum
access. More speciﬁcally, we seek to examine the availability of
both completely unused and intermittently used spectrum. For in-
termittently used channels, we also seek to examine the amount of
spectrum actually accessible to secondary devices, given the hard
constraints of avoiding disruptions to primary users.
Second, we seek to examine the role of various design decisions
and network factors in opportunistic spectrum access, including the
disruption limit set by the original owners, the time granularity of
spectrum access, and the type of information available to secondary
devices about the original owners.
Finally, we are interested to examine practical issues in utilizing
extracted spectrum to support today’s wireless services. Because
the extracted spectrum is fragmented across time and frequency, we
seek to identify ways to build reliable wireless transmission from
scattered spectrum pieces.
2.3 Datasets
We use two datasets in our analysis. They are unique in their
combination of wide frequency coverage, extensive measurement
length, and ﬁne-grained measurement frequency.
The ﬁrst dataset, used for most of the analysis, records the re-
ceived signal strength across 20MHz to 6GHz at three locations
over a period of one week. Table 1 lists some of the original own-
ers and their frequency ranges. The measurement was performed
by the Mobnets group of RWTH Aachen University, Germany [2].
The three measurement sites were i) on a balcony of a residential
building in Germany (GER1), ii) inside an ofﬁce building in Ger-
many (GER2) and iii) on a roof top in Netherlands (NED). At each
location, a spectrum analyzer repeatedly swept the 20MHz–6GHz
frequency range, measuring signal energy on each of the 200kHz
frequency channels. The measurement uses a 1.8 seconds sweep
time. That is, any two subsequent measurements on a single chan-
nel were 1.8 seconds apart. Using this dataset, we analyzed 5622
channels corresponding to the service bands listed in Table 1.
The second dataset came from our own measurements at UC
Santa Barbara, California, USA over a period of two weekdays in
April 2010 when school was in session. The goal of these measure-
ments is to sample primary user access patterns at a ﬁner-granularity
than the ﬁrst dataset. It contains the received energy strength in the
1925-1995MHz GSM frequency band, observed in an ofﬁce trailer.

Figure 1: An illustrative example of opportunistic spectrum ac-

cupancy. A secondary user (SU) periodically senses channel to
detect primary user and determine whether to access the chan-
nel. A disruption occurs if the primary user returns in the mid-
dle of secondary user transmissions.
We conﬁgured a GSM1900 digital receiver (Agilent E6454C) as a
spectrum analyzer which swept the GSM frequency with a resolu-
tion of 200kHz. Unlike a wide-band spectrum analyzer, our digital
analyzer only tunes to GSM frequencies. But since it covers a much
smaller frequency range, we can increase the sweep frequency to
once every 0.65 seconds. This dataset covers 300 channels, which
we use in Section 6 to study the impact of time granularity on op-
portunistic spectrum access.
Preprocessing. We preprocess our datasets to convert the re-
ceived signal strength traces to spectrum occupancy patterns (busy
or idle) on each measurement channel. To do so, we use the energy-
detection method [7, 23] and select (for each 200kHz measurement
channel) an energy threshold of -107dBm that is speciﬁed by the
IEEE 802.22 standard for TV bands [20]. We declare a frequency
channel as occupied (or busy) at a given time if its measured sig-
nal strength is above the threshold. While service bands could use
different thresholds to protect their transmissions, there are no rea-
sonable guides on what those individual thresholds should be. Thus
we apply this known threshold uniformly across different service
bands. For the NED location in the RWTH measurement as well as
our own UCSB measurement, we use a slightly higher threshold of
-100dBm. This is to compensate for the presence of stronger noise
ﬂoor, due to the proximity to a railway station in the case of NED
(also recommended by [23]), and the presence of metal walls and
obstacles in the case of UCSB measurements.
In addition to using a ﬁxed threshold, we also consider using dy-
namic thresholds as suggested by [7]. This is to set the threshold
for a frequency channel to be 3dBm higher than the minimum en-
ergy recorded on this channel. We found that this method, however,
is highly sensitive to the variance in the noise ﬂoor. It also marks
the majority of frequency channels as heavily occupied. Therefore,
we choose to use the ﬁxed threshold for our analysis, but adjust the
threshold based on local noise characteristics, as discussed in the
above.
2.4 Assumptions
We make a few assumptions in order to perform analysis on the
measurement datasets.
First, because both measurements sweep the frequency band se-
quentially to measure a wide frequency range, they do not capture
usage activities at time granularity smaller than the sweeping time.
Thus we set secondary user’s access slot size to be the same as
