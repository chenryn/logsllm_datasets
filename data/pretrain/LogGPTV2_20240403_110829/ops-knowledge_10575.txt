User: I'm using Debian. I installed Python 3.2.3. The path of Python 3 is /usr/bin/python3.
How do I change it in Spyder?
Assistant: Press CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+P to open the Preferences window. Within this window, select the Console item on the left, then the Advanced Settings tab. The path to the Python executable will be right there.
