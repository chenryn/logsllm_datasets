Windows Build `Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.134]`
Building linux kernels using `make menuconfig` is functional and produces
slight gibberish in the console. Attached should be screenshots of the console
and xterm after launching `make menuconfig` in the linux kernel repository as
pulled from github. (`git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux` then `cd
linux` and finally `make menuconfig` to reproduce what I've done.
I've tried to make the font sizes similar between WSL and Windows and in the
interests of time I stopped with the fonts you see in the screenshots.
The WSL console produces this:

This is what it should look like (ignore the difference in font.)

I have no idea what VT sequences are not being handled or what's going on, I
just noticed that it didn't look right.
This is probably a duplicate of #208 however I don't see exactly the same
behavior as the animation in that bug, so maybe this deserves its own bug.
Close it if it's a duplicate.
