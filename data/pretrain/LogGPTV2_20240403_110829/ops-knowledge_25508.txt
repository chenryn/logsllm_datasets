Confirm that the database connection string is set correctly: Check that the database connection string is correct. This may include the correct database name, username and password, host address and port number. 4. Verify that the database user and permissions are set up correctly: Make sure you have the required database access and that your application has the required access. 5. Confirm that the firewall settings are correct: Check that the firewall settings allow your application to communicate with the database server. 6.
