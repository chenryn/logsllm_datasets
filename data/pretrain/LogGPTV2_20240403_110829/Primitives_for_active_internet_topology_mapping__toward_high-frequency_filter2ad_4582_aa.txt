ABSTRACT
Current large-scale topology mapping systems require multi-
ple days to characterize the Internet due to the large amount
of probing traﬃc they incur. The accuracy of maps from
existing systems is unknown, yet empirical evidence sug-
gests that additional ﬁne-grained probing exposes hidden
links and temporal dynamics. Through longitudinal anal-
ysis of data from the Archipelago and iPlane systems, in
conjunction with our own active probing, we examine how
to shorten Internet topology mapping cycle time.
In par-
ticular, this work develops discriminatory primitives that
maximize topological ﬁdelity while being eﬃcient.
We propose and evaluate adaptive probing techniques that
leverage external knowledge (e.g., common subnetting struc-
tures) and data from prior cycle(s) to guide the selection of
probed destinations and the assignment of destinations to
vantage points. Our Interface Set Cover (ISC) algorithm
generalizes previous dynamic probing work. Crucially, ISC
runs across probing cycles to minimize probing while de-
tecting load balancing and reacting to topological changes.
To maximize the information gain of each trace, our Subnet
Centric Probing technique selects destinations more likely
to expose their network’s internal structure. Finally, the
Vantage Point Spreading algorithm uses network knowledge
to increase path diversity to destination ingress points.

INTRODUCTION
The scale of the Internet makes obtaining representative
metrics and characteristics challenging. Compounding this
challenge, the Internet is poorly instrumented, lacks mea-
surement and management mechanisms [5], and providers
hide information. Researchers therefore must frequently make
inferences over limited available data, and may form false
conclusions [15].
Understanding the complex structure of the Internet is vi-
tal for network research including routing, protocol valida-
tion, developing new architectures, etc. More importantly,
building robust networks, and protecting critical infrastruc-
ture, depends on accurate topology mapping.
While dedicated platforms exist to perform topology mea-
surements, e.g. [11, 19], these must balance induced mea-
surement load against model ﬁdelity. Unfortunately, in prac-
tice, such balancing results in multiple days worth of mea-
surement to capture even an incomplete portion of the Inter-
net. Employing more vantage points is an eﬀective technique
to improve topological recall [23], but does not reduce total
load or cycle time.
This work proposes primitives toward the eventual goal
of performing high-frequency active Internet topology mea-
surement. Measurement load hinders the ability to capture
small-scale dynamics and transient eﬀects that occur at fre-
quencies higher than the measurement period; eﬀectively
creating Nyquist aliasing loss. For example, recent work
[20] shows fewer than 50% of Internet paths remain station-
ary across consecutive days. Our own analysis of set cover
techniques [10] ﬁnds that the rate of missed interfaces in-
creases in proportion to the time since the covering set was
created:
implying that “train-then-test” methodologies are
insuﬃcient.
Our work therefore focuses on two separable problems via
a uniﬁed methodology, how to: i) select destinations in the
network to probe; and ii) perform the probe. We examine the
hypothesis that by leveraging external network knowledge,
e.g. routing, address structure, etc., and adaptive probing,
the active traﬃc load can be signiﬁcantly reduced without
sacriﬁcing the inferred topology ﬁdelity. Our methodology
extends prior schemes, e.g. [8] which attempt to reduce mea-
surement overhead, but are artiﬁcially parametrized, lossy,
and ignore temporal eﬀects across measurement periods. To-
ward high-frequency Internet topology mapping, we:
1. Quantify unnecessary probing performed by produc-
tion topology measurement platforms.
2. Develop three algorithms that use network knowledge
to intelligently drive adaptive probing.

2. UNNECESSARY PROBING
Several large topology measurement experiments have been
deployed,
including CAIDA’s Skitter/Archipelago project
(Ark) [11, 13], iPlane [19], and DIMES [22]. To better un-
derstand the challenges in topology mapping, this section fo-
cuses on the existing practice of Ark and iPlane which infer
interface-level topologies via traceroute-like [1, 17] probing.
So that measurement is tractable, production systems of-
ten follow common assumptions over the Internet’s struc-
ture, for instance by probing a target in each subnetwork of
size 28 (herein referred to via common /24 preﬁx notation).
Ark subdivides all routed preﬁxes (i.e. visible in BGP) into
/24’s. A “cycle” of probing is a complete set of measure-
ments to one destination address within each routed /24.
The probe target for a given /24 is randomly selected from
the 28 possible addresses.
a cycle consists of ∼ 231−8 /24s. Due to this large number of
/24’s to be probed in a cycle, approximately 9M, Ark divides
the probing work among multiple vantage points (measure-
ment sites). Probing at a /24 granularity requires signiﬁcant
time, and load. With asynchronous, distributed probing to
mitigate per-path RTT variance, a full cycle requires multi-
ple days to partially characterize the Internet.
With approximately half of all IP addresses globally routable,
Traces can be distilled into an interface-level representa-
tion of the Internet graph. Some traces yield more informa-
tion than others based on the choice of prior probes. For
instance, we expect traces to diﬀerent addresses within the
same BGP preﬁx to be similar, while probes to very diﬀerent
destination addresses are likely to have a higher information
gain.
2.1 A Path Pair Distance Metric
To quantify the information gain of intra-BGP traces, we
use the Levenshtein, or edit, distance which is a measure of
the minimum number of insert, delete or modify operations
required to equate two strings.
Let the alphabet of symbols be the unsigned 32-bit in-
teger space, Σ = {0, . . . , 232 − 1}. We compute the edit
distance (ED) between trace pairs using each IP address
along the path. An ED of zero implies that the two paths
are identical, whereas an ED of one implies that the two
traces diﬀer by a single interface addition, subtraction, or
replacement. For example, for the following two interface
paths, ED(t1, t2) = 2:
t1 = 1.2.6.1, 1.186.254.13, 2.245.179.52, 4.53.34.1
t2 =
1.2.6.1, 2.245.179.52, 4.69.15.1
We use data from a single Ark and single iPlane monitor
in a January, 2010 cycle for ED analysis. As a compara-
tive baseline, we also compute ED over an equal number of
random trace pairs.
2.2 Quantifying Unnecessary Probing
Figure 1(a) shows the cumulative fraction of path pairs in
Ark and iPlane as a function of ED. The ED is larger for
the randomly selected traceroute path pairs than the pairs
from within the same BGP preﬁx, as determined by a con-
temporaneous Routeviews [21] BGP routing table. Approx-
imately 60% of traces to destination in the same BGP preﬁx
have ED ≤ 3 while fewer than 50% of random traces have
ED ≤ 10. Thus, as we intuitively expect, there is value to
using the BGP structure to drive the probe target selection
in order to maximize the information gain.
Next, we wish to quantify the contribution of the last hop
autonomous system (AS) to the edit distance of traces to the
same BGP preﬁx, i.e. path diﬀerence attributable to subnet-
ting within an AS. For example, Figure 2 depicts the sources
of path diversity observed as an “hourglass” with multiple
vantage points contributing to diversity into an AS’s ingress
points, and the degree of subnetting within the destination
AS contributing to the remaining diversity. The “waist” is
the set of ingress points for a preﬁx which may be common
to multiple traces or require distributed vantage points in or-
der to be discovered (§4.3 discusses the diminishing return
of additional vantage points).
Figure 1(b) is the result of an ED analysis after remov-
ing interface hops belonging to the destination AS, as de-
termined by the Routeviews BGP table. We observe that
for ∼ 70% of the probe pairs to the same preﬁx, there is
zero additional information gain beyond the leaf-AS. There-
fore, from this oﬀ-line analysis of traces from two important

topology platforms, we conclude that there exist signiﬁcant
possible packet savings by intelligently tuning, e.g. via time-
to-live (TTL), the set of hops each trace interrogates. For
instance, a basic tracing strategy might start with a TTL
suitable to reach the destination and iteratively decrement
the TTL until a previously discovered hop, i.e. at the AS
ingress, is found.
Moreover, in analyzing pairs of traceroutes to the same
destination preﬁx, but from diﬀerent vantage points, we ﬁnd
that in ∼ 30% of the cases, entirely new paths are discov-
ered. Only approximately 10% of the probes from a new
vantage point yield less than four previously undiscovered
interfaces. Thus, there exists signiﬁcant information gain
from additional vantage points.
These potential eﬃciencies have been recognized, most
prominently by the DoubleTree method [8, 7]. Unfortu-
nately, DoubleTree relies on heuristics to tune its probing.
In §3 we detail non-parameterized primitives designed to ad-
dress the low-gain we ﬁnd here and provide eﬃciency with-
out sacriﬁcing inference power.
Note that the ED’s for iPlane are higher than for Ark due
a non-uniform distribution of traces to preﬁxes as part of the
iPlane logic [18]. Since iPlane provides signiﬁcantly fewer
instances of multiple probes to the same preﬁx as compared
with Ark, we can more readily test our primitives against
the latter. We therefore use historic Ark data, as well as our
own active probing, for the remainder of this paper.
3. ADAPTIVE PROBING METHODOLOGY
This section presents three strategies to illustrate the po-
tential power of adaptive probing in reducing unnecessary
probing: 1) subnet centric probing; 2) interface set cover ;
and 3) vantage point spreading.
3.1 Subnet Centric Probing
A na¨ıve strategy of leveraging BGP knowledge is to probe
exactly one destination within each advertised preﬁx. The
potential for using BGP routing information was ﬁrst recog-
nized by Krishnamurty and Wang [14]. While we show that
such an approach incurs approximately one-ﬁfth of the nor-
mal amount of probing packets sent by Ark, it is too aggres-
sive and misses signiﬁcant topology information of networks
with a rich subnetting structure.
Intuitively, we expect two numerically consecutive IP ad-
dresses to be more likely to share paths (and, hence, have a
low ED) than two distant addresses. But simply employing
address distance is too simplistic and does not capture typ-
ical network subnetting structure [4]. For example, the two
IP addresses 18.255.255.254 and 19.1.1.1 have a numerical
distance of 2, but they would belong to diﬀerent networks
unless both belonged to a single 18.0.0.0/7 subnetwork.
Instead, we propose to use the knowledge of how net-
works are subnetted (the preceding example illustrating an
example where subnetting is much more probable than no
