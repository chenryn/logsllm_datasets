### Problem description
I recently updated material-ui from 0.18.2 to 0.18.4 and noticed that the
buttons in my application have a unusual white gap on the bottom of the
buttons with a containerElement attached to it (the element is a react
element.
I switched back to 0.18.2 and the gap seized to exist. I upgrade to 0.18.3 and
it still didn't appear until I upgraded to 0.18.4.
The difference seems to be that the button now has a overflow: hidden
attribute to it whereas the other buttons do not show this attribute at all.
### Link to minimal working code that reproduces the issue
You can see this problem on the demo where a RaisedButton
has the gap when you hover over it. I don't see this problem in other buttons.
