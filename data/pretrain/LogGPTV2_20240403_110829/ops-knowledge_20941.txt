User: How to deploy and run a web application using Docker?
Assistant: The following are the general steps for deploying and running web applications using Docker: 1. Select a suitable Docker image (Docker image), and download official or community-maintained web application images from Docker Hub. You can also write your own Dockerfile and use the docker build command to build a custom image. 2. Create a container in Docker, use the docker run command or write a docker-compose.yml file to configure the running parameters of the container, such as port mapping, environment variables, and data volumes. 3. Start the container, use the docker start command or the docker-compose up command to start the container in batches. You can use the docker logs command to view the container running logs, or use the docker exec command to enter the container for debugging. 4. Access the web application, and access the web service running in the container through a web browser or other HTTP client. Pay attention to the port mapping relationship and firewall settings inside the container. 5. Maintain and manage containers, use the docker stop command to stop the container, use the docker rm command to delete the container, use the docker push command to upload the custom image to the Docker warehouse, etc.
