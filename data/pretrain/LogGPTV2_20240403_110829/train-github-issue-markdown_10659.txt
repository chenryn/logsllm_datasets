After trying `pip3 install uvicorn` i get the error message `Failed building
wheel for httptools`.
I know this is a duplication of this error (MagicStack/httptools#33), but I
can't seem to find a solution. Anyone having the same problem, or know of a
solution?
I'm on macOS Mojave 0.14.2  
with python 3.7.1, but on 3.6.3 I had the same issue.
