After running the command `pip3 install uvicorn`, I encountered the following error: `Failed building wheel for httptools`.

I am aware that this issue has been reported before (see [MagicStack/httptools#33](https://github.com/MagicStack/httptools/issues/33)), but I have not been able to find a working solution. Has anyone else experienced this problem, or does anyone know of a solution?

**System Information:**
- **Operating System:** macOS Mojave 10.14.2
- **Python Versions:** 3.7.1 and 3.6.3 (the issue persists in both versions)

Thank you in advance for any assistance!
