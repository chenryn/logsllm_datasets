fuel. In order to acquire bigger dataset, the collected real data is expanded
with proportional simulated data. The final operative dataset contains data for
vehicles with many engine capacities and carbon emission amounts. The x-axis
contains the engine capacity measured in cubic centimetres (cc). The y-axis

The outcome clusters obtained after execution of the clustering algorithm are
shown in Fig.4. The data points, which have unique IDs, corresponds to the
vehicles.

The clustering algorithm should place vehicles, which have equal engine
capacity and different amount of emissions preferably in the same cluster. In
this way, the vehicles with not optimal emissions will not be placed in any clus-

maximal internal cluster distance in cluster K8 is 24mg. The vehicles with IDs
8759305, 6947228 and 5915180 are detected as outliers, because the distance
from them to their nearest clusters is bigger than the internal cluster distance.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper we presented an IoT platform, called EcoLogic, for real-time mon-
itoring, analysis and control of carbon dioxide emissions exposed into the atmo-
sphere by vehicles with internal combustion engines.
The platform has the following advantages:
 High availability and velocity during work with big amounts of data due
to cloud-native architecture.
 Platform-agnostic – possibility to work with different vehicles and clouds.
The hardware modules are flexible and easy extendable to work with variety of
sensors and/or collect data from the default onboard diagnostic bus or sensors
of the vehicles. The implemented cloud-native applications are microservices,
which are not vendor locked and can work on different clouds.

The following routes for further improvements are identified and will be
addressed in the latter stages of the project:
 The engine capacity and carbon dioxide emission parameters are not ade-
quate to appropriately regulate the amount of fuel injected. The solution could

be extended to use also other parameters like vehicle weight and performance
requirements for better control.
 The measured parameters on cold and hot (with normal working temper-
ature) engine are not deviate between each other. The measurements on a cold
engine leads to detection of the outliers. The solution could be optimized to use
twoseparatedatasets:data,whichismeasuredonnormallyworkingengineand
data, which is measured on cold engine.
 Different algorithm for anomaly detection or classification can be used. It
can be a supervisedmachine learning algorithm, which takes the data measured

The increasing proliferation of global cyber-attacks, at a frightening rate, has been
facilitated by the connectivity growth using wired and wireless communication tech-
nologies between various heterogeneous systems. These attacks dangerously aim at a
broadarrayofcomputingsystemsvaryingfromdatacentersandpersonalmachinesto
mobile devices and industrial control systems. The deficiency of existing cyber-
defenses and strategies may hinder the ability of security practitioners in applying
suitable and timely reactions against these threats. Additionally, the inadequacies in
existing digital investigation techniques and tools pose many challenges related to
determining the identity of the threat actors, discovering the root vulnerability to
impedeanysubsequentexploitationofarelatedevent,andidentifyingthethreatactors’
motivations for the development of efficient cybersecurity defense strategies.
Cyber forensics and threat investigations has rapidly emerged as a new field to
provide the key elements for ensuring that the next generation of emerging infras-
tructures, such as service-oriented architecture and cloud environments, are secure,
reliable, and trustworthy, where all future internet services and applications will be
hosted and running. In this regard, a rethinking in the current digital investigations’

CFTIC 2020 gathered about 52 attendees on Discord. The discussions following
the presentations and the closing showed a big interest in the novel and emerging

event can be regarded as a complete success.

1 Introduction
DevelopingrobustDataMining(DM)methodsforHumanActivityRecognition
(HAR)fromreal-timesmart-homeorsmart-phonesensordatahasbeenreported
by the likes of [4,16,21] to be a challenging task. One of the main problems
with correctly classifying peoples’ actions is caused by observations which do
not conform to an expected pattern. This is because human beings going about
their daily lives are unlikely to execute activities in exactly the same way so
models that attempt to classify such activities based on sensor activations need
to adapt accordingly [22,27].
State-of-the-art methods have been influenced by work conducted in data
stream clustering [23], concept drift adaptation [11], and activity recognition
