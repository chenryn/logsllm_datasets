### Optimized Text

**Fuel.** To expand the dataset, real-world data is supplemented with proportionally simulated data. The final operational dataset includes information on vehicles with various engine capacities and carbon emission levels. The x-axis represents the engine capacity in cubic centimeters (cc), while the y-axis indicates the mass of carbon dioxide emissions in milligrams (mg).

The resulting clusters from the clustering algorithm are shown in Figure 4. Each data point, identified by a unique ID, corresponds to a vehicle.

**Figure 4. Clusters of Real Dataset**

The clustering algorithm aims to group vehicles with the same engine capacity but different emission levels into the same cluster. This approach ensures that vehicles with suboptimal emissions are not included in any cluster and are instead detected as outliers. The algorithm generates eight clusters (K1-K8) for the current dataset, representing vehicles grouped into eight distinct engine capacities: 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2500, 3000, and 3200 cubic centimeters, respectively. The carbon dioxide emissions values vary between 2.70 mg and 50.44 mg.

- **Vehicle with ID 8759305**: Engine capacity of 1800 cc, emissions of 56.07 mg.
  - Nearest cluster center: K3, distance of 38 mg.
  - Maximal internal cluster distance in K3: 18 mg.

- **Vehicle with ID 6947228**: Engine capacity of 3200 cc, emissions of 81.42 mg.
- **Vehicle with ID 5915180**: Engine capacity of 3200 cc, emissions of 83.86 mg.
  - Nearest cluster center for both: K8, distances of 54 mg and 56 mg, respectively.
  - Maximal internal cluster distance in K8: 24 mg.

Vehicles with IDs 8759305, 6947228, and 5915180 are detected as outliers because their distances to the nearest clusters exceed the internal cluster distances. These vehicles do not have optimal carbon dioxide emissions compared to the rest of the vehicles in clusters K1-K8. Notably, the outlier with ID 8759305 has parameter values measured during the idle period on a cold engine. The outliers with IDs 6947228 and 5915180 have simulated parameters based on the real vehicle's parameters on a cold engine. The results from the algorithm are feasible and validate its correctness on the real dataset. The hardware modules of the detected anomalies are notified, and actuators are activated.

### An Information Retrieval-Based Approach to Activity Recognition in Smart Homes

**Abstract:**
Developing robust Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from real-time smart home sensor data faces challenges such as variations in activity sequence length, sensor contributions, and class imbalance. These variations can reduce the efficacy of classification models. Additionally, prior solutions have been complex, leading to long training times. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a data structure that captures the duration and frequency information of each sensor for an activity, transforming this data into an Information Retrieval (IR)-based representation, and comparing the utility of this representation using four different supervised classifiers. Our proposed framework, combined with a state-of-the-art ensemble learner, results in more accurate and scalable ML classification models better suited for offline HAR in a smart home setting.

**Keywords:**
Human activity recognition, smart homes, machine learning

**1. Introduction**
Developing robust Data Mining (DM) methods for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from real-time smart home or smartphone sensor data is challenging. One of the main issues is the variability in human behavior, which makes it difficult for models to classify activities based on sensor activations. State-of-the-art methods have been influenced by data stream clustering, concept drift adaptation, and activity recognition with labeled and unlabeled data. However, there are still challenges in determining the most appropriate representation of data streams. Different activity-based representations, from window-based techniques to knowledge-driven ontology-based methods, have been explored, but the problem remains unsolved. Investigating the intra and inter-sequencing of activities, along with class imbalance and interleaving of activities, is crucial. The fundamental problem in HAR for smart homes is to correctly associate a sequence of sensor readings with an activity label.
