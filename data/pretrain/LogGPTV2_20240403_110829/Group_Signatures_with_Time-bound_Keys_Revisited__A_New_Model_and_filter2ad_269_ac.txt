signature can be traced, and no adversary can produce a
valid signature using a secret key after the expiry time of
the signing key has passed.

(Traceability). For any PPT adver-
sary A and a security parameter λ ∈ N, we deﬁne the exper-

Then, e(eht,bg) = e(egyt ,bg) = e(eg,bgyt ) = e(eg,bht) hold. A
group signature σ contains ehβ
t , egd(xi+β), egd and bgd where
β and d are randomness chosen by the signer. If a signer i
is prematurely revoked, then the group manager computes
grti,t := grtyt

e(egd(xi+β),bgyt ) = e(egd(xi+β),bht). By checking whether the
equation holds for each grti,t one by one, the veriﬁer can
check whether the signer is prematurely revoked or not. The
randomness d, chosen in each signing, prevents to link two
signatures generated by the same signer at the same time
period.

Next, we give our scheme as follows.

put gpk = ((G1, G2, GT , e, g,bg), f,eg, g1, g2, h0, h1, h2,

• The group manager assigns a leaf node η to τi.
