User: By given an entity ID , I will query by models = Model.get_by_id(id). However, I find out that some time it will not return result collectly.
Is there any alternative or recommended method to query by entity ID in Google App Engine, python?
Assistant: The problem disappear by itself after the 2011-05-10, which is the v1.5 launch date. Not sure this problem is related.
I didn't change any code, as the get_by_id() was fine all the while and on this few days. Beside, I added a cron job to run the get_by_id() every minutes and try to get the instance alive.
From my observation, the get_by_id() failed because it couldn't query the datastore.
Btw, the setting of datastore is Master/Slave Replication.
