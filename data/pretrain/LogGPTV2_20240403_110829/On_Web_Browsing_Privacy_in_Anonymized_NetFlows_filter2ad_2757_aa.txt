## Abstract

Anonymization of network traces is widely considered a necessary condition for releasing such data for research purposes. A key goal of trace anonymization is to prevent the recovery of web browsing activities. While several studies have examined the possibility of reconstructing web browsing activities from anonymized packet-level traces, we argue that these approaches fail to address many real-world challenges, and are unlikely to be successful with coarser NetFlow logs. In this paper, we develop new methods to identify target web pages within anonymized NetFlow data, addressing challenges such as browser caching and session parsing. We evaluate our techniques on the front pages of the 50 most popular websites (as ranked by Alexa.com) in both closed-world and real-world scenarios. Our results show that certain types of web pages with unique and complex structures remain identifiable despite state-of-the-art anonymization techniques. This poses a significant threat to web browsing privacy, as an attacker can approximate the web browsing conditions represented in the flow logs.

## 1. Introduction

Recently, there has been a significant emphasis on creating anonymization systems to maintain the privacy of network data while allowing it to be published for research [23, 24, 17, 9, 22]. The primary goals of anonymization are:
1. To hide structural information about the network, preventing the disclosure of private security information.
2. To prevent the assembly of behavioral profiles for users, such as the websites they browse.

In this paper, we focus on evaluating the effectiveness of current anonymization methods in achieving the second goal. Specifically, we assess the feasibility of identifying individual web pages within anonymized NetFlow logs [4]. Our work distinguishes itself from prior studies by operating on flow-level data rather than packet traces, and by carefully examining practical concerns associated with implementing such identification in real network data. Previous studies have focused on packet-level features, which cannot be readily scaled to flow-level data. Instead, we use NetFlow data, which is becoming more common in network and security research [13, 21, 33, 5].

Our primary contribution is a rigorous experimental evaluation of the threat posed by web page identification in anonymized data. Unlike previous evaluations, our approach accounts for significant issues such as dynamic web pages, browser caching, web session parsing, and HTTP pipelining. We apply machine learning techniques to accommodate variations in web page download behavior and can parse and identify web pages even within multiple interleaved flows, such as those created by tabbed browsing, without additional information. Our method involves modeling the web servers involved in the download of a web page and using these models to find corresponding servers in anonymized NetFlow data. We also formalize the "20 Questions" game as a binary Bayes belief network to narrow down possible download scenarios.

Our evaluation juxtaposes the assumptions of closed-world scenarios used in previous work with the realities of identifying web pages in live network data. In controlled environments, our techniques detected approximately 50% of targeted web pages with less than 0.2% false detections. In more realistic scenarios, true and false detection rates varied based on the type of web page. Our results show that certain types of web pages are easily identifiable in real network data, while others remain anonymous due to false detections or poor true detection rates. Additionally, we examine the effects of locality (i.e., different networks for training and testing data) on web page detection using three distinct datasets from disparate network environments. Overall, our findings indicate that information leakage from anonymized flow logs poses a threat to web browsing privacy, as an attacker can approximate the basic browser settings and network conditions under which the pages were downloaded.

## 2. Background and Related Work

Network trace anonymization is an active area of research in the security community, with ongoing development of anonymization methods [9, 23, 30] and releases of network data [26, 7]. Several attacks have demonstrated weaknesses in the privacy provided by these techniques, including passive [6] and active attacks [2, 3], which have shown that deanonymization of public servers and recovery of network topology information is possible in some cases. However, an in-depth examination of the extent to which web browsing privacy may be at risk has been lacking.

Existing approaches for inferring web browsing activities within encrypted tunnels [19, 32, 11, 1, 18, 8] assume unambiguous identification of connections constituting a web page retrieval. This assumption underestimates the difficulty of the problem, as it is often nontrivial to delineate the flows that constitute a single page retrieval, especially with NetFlow data. Koukis et al. [14] present a study of web browsing behavior inference within anonymized packet traces, but their approach, which uses packet inter-arrival times to delineate sessions, is not always effective. Our work addresses additional challenges and provides a more in-depth evaluation, applying to flow traces which offer coarser information than packet traces.

## 3. Identifying Web Pages in Anonymized NetFlow Logs

The anonymized NetFlow data we consider consists of time-ordered records, each summarizing packets sent from the server to the client within a TCP connection. These unidirectional flow records contain source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, timestamps, and the total size of the traffic. We assume consistent pseudonyms for IP addresses and that port numbers and sizing information are not altered. This allows us to separate connections initiated from different hosts and filter flows originating from port 80.

Initially, we assume that web browsing sessions can be adequately parsed from the NetFlow log. Though accurate session parsing is difficult even with packet traces, we adopt this assumption to facilitate the extraction of features that uniquely identify target web pages and model their behavior. 

### 3.1 Feature Selection

We observe that the front page of msn.com is inconsistent in the number and size of flows, with significant overlap among examples. The number of flows and their sizes depend on how the client requests objects, and changes in dynamic content or browser cache can cause object drift. This makes the number of flows and their sizes poor indicators of the web page identity. However, the cumulative size of flows provides a more consistent path toward the target cumulative size. 

Using flow size, index number, and cumulative size, we can plot these features in 3-dimensional space. The paths taken in this space indicate the behavior of the web page download. For example, the paths for yahoo.com and msn.com are distinct, with msn.com's path remaining similar to past sessions.

Server sessions, which involve the sequence of flows from each web server, further refine the identification process. Separating flows by the server that produced them shows that each server occupies a distinct area in the 3-dimensional space, offering two benefits: better identification and more robust modeling.

## Conclusion

Our work demonstrates that certain types of web pages remain identifiable in anonymized NetFlow logs, posing a significant threat to web browsing privacy. By accounting for real-world challenges and using advanced techniques, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the risks associated with anonymized network data.
