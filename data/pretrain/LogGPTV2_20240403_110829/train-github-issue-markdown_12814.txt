### Context
- **Playwright Version:** 1.9.1
- **Operating System:** macOS Monterey
- **Browser:** Chrome

### Description of the Issue

I am currently using the unofficial TikTok API, which is based on Playwright (GitHub: [davidteather/TikTok-Api](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api)), to scrape data from TikTok. After updating my Mac to macOS Monterey, the script I use for scraping has stopped working and now throws an error. I have attempted to reinstall all the necessary packages, including Playwright, but the issue persists.

### Error Message

```python

### Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue
- Reinstalled all required packages.
- Reinstalled Playwright.

Despite these efforts, the script continues to fail with the same error. Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
