What is a License?
 Giving some of your rights or privileges to 
another person who would not normally 
have them.
Licensing Agreements 101: The Creative Commons  - Slide 10 of 36
What is a Contract?
 An Agreement between (at least) two 
parties.
 Each party must provide something in 
exchange.
 Exchange can be benefit or detriment, either 
immediately or at some point in the future.   
 Parties must act as though they agree to 
the contract.
 Contracts are governed by state law.
Licensing Agreements 101: The Creative Commons  - Slide 11 of 36
Contract + License = 
Licensing Agreement
 Licensor agrees to allow Content User to 
make use of their work as long as they 
follow the terms of the contract.
Content User receives the benefit of using the 
protected work.
Licensor receives the “legal detriment” of 
giving up some copy-rights.
Licensing Agreements 101: The Creative Commons  - Slide 12 of 36
How does federal copyright 
law fit in to all this?
 In effect, the contract creates exception to 
general federal law.
 Federal law creates the rights
 State law handles how the contract is    
enforced
 CC License explicitly does not effect all of 
your copy-rights.
