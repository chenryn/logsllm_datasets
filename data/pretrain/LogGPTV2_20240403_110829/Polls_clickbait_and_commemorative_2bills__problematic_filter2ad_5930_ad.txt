Figure 7: Campaign and advocacy ads by organization type of the advertiser, color-coded by the political affiliation of the
advertiser. Ads from registered committees dominated, roughly evenly divided between Democratic and Republican ads, but
ads from news organizations and nonprofits were more heavily conservative and nonpartisan respectively.
UnitedVoice.com (800 ads, 3.6%), and rightwing.org (393 ads, 1.8%).
ConservativeBuzz does not have a website, despite claiming to be a
news source on their landing page; UnitedVoice and rightwing.org
are ranked 248,997 and 539,506 on the Tranco Top 1m.
Other advertisers in this category are more well-known, e.g.,
Daily Kos, a liberal blog (690 ads, 3.1%, site rank 3,218); Human
Events, a conservative newspaper (390 ads, 1.8%, rank 19,311); News-
max, a conservative news network (117 ads, 0.5%, rank 2,441).
Unregistered Groups. Unregistered groups ran a small number
of ads. The top advertiser was “Gone2Shit”, a campaign from the
marketing firm MullenLowe, which ran 228 ads for a humorous
voter turnout campaign. The U.S. Concealed Carry Association ran
162 ads. Beyond these top two, a number of “astroturfing” groups or
other industry interest groups ran ads, such as “A Healthy Future”
(lobbying against price controls on Rx drugs), “Clean Fuel Washing-
ton”, and “Texans for Affordable Rx” (a front for the Pharmaceutical
Care Management Association, based on investigating their web-
site). Other top ads came from unregistered, left-leaning groups,
such as “Progress North” and “Opportunity Wisconsin”, which de-
scribe themselves as grassroots movements. We also saw a small
number of groups consisting of coalitions of registered nonprof-
its, who collectively fund an ad campaign, such as “No Surprises:
People Against Unfair Medical Bills” and “votewith.us”.
Businesses and Government Agencies. Some businesses, e.g., Levi’s,
Absolut Vodka, ran political ads: mostly nonpartisan ads for voter
registration. State/local election boards also ran voter information
ads, e.g. the NYC Board of Elections.
4.6 Misleading Political Polls
Focusing now on the content of ads in our campaign and advocacy
category, rather than the advertisers, we highlight the use of polls,
petitions, and surveys, many of which appear to contain misleading
content, and manipulate users into providing their email addresses.
The purpose of many online political petitions and polls are to
allow political actors to harvest personal details like email addresses,
so that they can solicit donations, canvas, or advertise to those
people in the future [66]. This phenomenon is present in our dataset.
In a few cases (30 ads), ads we labeled as polls or petitions linked
to nonpartisan public opinion polling firms such as YouGov and
Civiqs, but most ads were from political groups, and had landing
pages asking people to provide their email addresses.
Figure 8: The political affiliation and organization types of
poll/petition advertisers. These ads were primarily run by
unaffiliated conservative advertisers, mostly news organiza-
tions and nonprofits.
We observe that poll and petition ads are more common from
politically conservative advertisers. In Fig. 8, we visualize the num-
ber of poll ads by the political affiliation of their advertisers. Non-
affiliated conservative groups (mostly news organizations and non-
profits) ran the highest number of poll and petition ads (3,960
ads, 52% of total), followed by Republican party committees (1,389,
18.2%). Democratic committees ran fewer poll ads than their Re-
publican counterparts (1,027 ads, 13.5%), while non-partisans and
nonaffiliated liberals rarely use poll ads (458 ads, 6%; 53 ads, 0.6%).
Poll ads also made up a greater proportion of ads on right-leaning
websites than other sites: 2.2% on Right and 1.1% on right-leaning
websites were polls and petitions, compared to 1.1% on Left, 0.2%
on left-leaning, and 0.2% on center sites.
Next, we describe several topics and manipulative tactics used
by poll ads, which differ across political affiliations.
Democratic-Affiliated Groups. Most poll or petition ads from
Democratic-affiliated groups were for highly partisan issue-based
petitions, e.g., “Stand with Obama: Demand Congress Pass a Vote-
by-Mail Option”, “Official Petition: Demand Amy Coney Barrett
Resign - Add Your Name”. However, some petitions used even more
contrived scenarios, such as posing as a “thank you card” for im-
portant politicians (Fig. 9a). These ads were run by affiliated PACs
rather than party or candidate committees, such as the National
Democratic Training Committee (290 ads), Progressive Turnout
Project (282 ads), and Democratic Strategy Institute (215 ads).

Republican-Affiliated Groups. The Trump campaign ran 906 ads
with positive and neutral polls promoting President Trump and
479 ads with polls that attacked their opponent (e.g., Fig. 9b). Other
Republican committees, such as the NRCC, used the LockerDome ad
platform to run generic-looking polls not clearly labeled as political
(e.g., Fig. 9d). Moreover, Lockerdome was also used by unaffiliated
advertisers, e.g., “All Sears MD”, rawconservativeopinions.com, to
run nearly identical-looking ads that were used to sell political
products; this homogenization makes it difficult for users to discern
the nature of such ads. We also found 5 Lockerdome ads from the
“Keep America Great Committee,” whose operators turned out to
be using it to commit fraud and pocket donations [50].
Conservative News Organizations. The largest subgroup of adver-
tisers that used polls were right-leaning news organizations, such
as such as ConservativeBuzz, UnitedVoice, and rightwing.org. Some
polls use neutral language, e.g., “Who Won the First Presidential
Debate?”, while others used more provocative language, e.g., “Do
Illegal Immigrants Deserve Unemployment Benefits?” (Fig. 9c).
Journalistic investigations have found that advertisers like Con-
servativeBuzz purport to be conservative news organizations but
are actually run by Republican-linked digital marketing firms. Ap-
pearing as news, many of their stories are plagiarized and/or serve
a political agenda. Their misleading poll ads are an entry point for
harvesting email addresses for their mailing lists. They profit from
these mailing lists by sending ads to their subscribers, including
ads from political campaigns [6, 49].
Our data backs up these findings. We inspected poll ads from
ConservativeBuzz, UnitedVoice, and rightwing.org, who comprise
55% of poll ads from Right/Conservative advertisers, and 29% of
poll ads overall. The landing pages of their ads often asked for an
email address to submit poll responses (Appendix E). We looked
up these advertisers in the Archive of Political Emails to see the
content of the emails that they send to subscribers 2. We found that
their emails often contained a mix of spam for various products
(Subject: “This Toxic Vegetable Is The #1 Danger In Your Diet”),
biased or inaccurate political news (Subject: “Fauci-Obama-Wuhan
Connection Exposed in This Bombshell Report”), or a combination
of the two (Subject: “URGENT – Think Trump Won? You need to
see this...”, selling a Trump mug).

Political Product Ads
4.7
We now consider ads in our dataset that used political content to
sell products, divided into three categories.
4.7.1 Ads for Memorabilia. We observed 3,186 ads for political
memorabilia, including clothing with slogans, collectibles, and nov-
elty items. These ads were placed by commercial businesses – none
were affiliated with political parties. Our GSDMM model produced
45 topics for political memorabilia ads; Tab. 4 shows the top seven.
We observe that the majority of memorabilia ads are targeted
towards conservative consumers. 2,175 advertisements (68.3% of
memorabilia ads) contained “Donald” and/or “Trump”. Seven of the
top ten topics are directly related to Trump, selling items such as
special edition $2 bills (Fig. 10a), electric lighters, garden gnomes,
and trading cards.
Some memorabilia ads targeting conservatives used potentially
misleading practices. While some ads clearly advertised themselves
as products, others disguised the memorabilia as “free” items, but
requires payment to cover shipping and handling. Many ads did
not clearly disclose the name of the advertiser. Some straddled the
line between product ads and clickbait by making claims that the
product “angered Democrats” or would “melt snowflakes.” We also
observed many collectible bills and coins, advertised as "Legal U.S.
Tender", by sellers such as Patriot Depot, making dramatic claims
like "Trump Supporters Get a Free $1000 Bill."
We observed far fewer ads for left-leaning consumers; the first
topic containing left-leaning products was the 15th largest at 71
ads. Ads targeting liberals include a pin for “flaming feminists” or
a deck of cards themed around the 2020 Senate Impeachment Trial
of former President Trump (Fig. 10b).
4.7.2 Ads Using Political Context To Sell Something Else. We ob-
served 1,258 ads that leveraged the political climate for their own
marketing. Some of these ads were from legitimate companies,
such as Capitol One advertising their alliance with the Black Eco-
nomic Alliance to close opportunity gaps, or the Wall Street Jour-
nal promoting their market insight tools. However, many others
were from relatively unknown advertisers peddling get-quick-rich
schemes, like stocks that would “soar” from Biden winning the
election (Fig. 10c) or election-proof security in buying gold.
Our GSDMM model found 29 topics for ads categorized as non-
political products using political context. Tab. 5 details the largest 7
topics. The most prominent political contexts used for these topics
were Congress (e.g., legislation related to the product) and the 2020

Political Context
election. Finance related topics in particular often cited market
uncertainty around the election, e.g., referencing how a certain out-
come might affect stocks and promoting their product as a hedge
or chance to capitalize. Notably, three of the top four topics tar-
geted older audiences: “hearing devices,” “retirement finance,” and
“seniors’ mortgage.”
4.7.3 Where did political product ads appear? We find that politi-
cal product ads appeared much more frequently on right-of-center
websites (Fig. 11). This finding aligns with the qualitative content
that we observed in these ads — a large amount of Trump memora-
bilia, and “scare” headlines about the election outcome. Two-sample
Pearson Chi-Squared tests indicate a statistically significant asso-
ciation between the political bias of the site and the number of
political product ads observed, both for mainstream news sites
(𝜒2(10, 𝑁 = 1, 150, 676) = 4871.97, 𝑝 < .0001) and misinformation
sites (𝜒2(8, 𝑁 = 206, 559) = 414.75, 𝑝 < .0001). Pairwise compar-
isons using Pearson Chi-squared tests, corrected with the Holm-
Bonferroni method, indicate that all pairs of website biases were
significantly different (𝑝 < .0001), except for the following pairs on
misinformation sites: (Lean Left, Lean Right), (Lean Left, Left), and
(Lean Left, Uncategorized).

Figure 11: The percentage of ads observed that were for po-
litical products, by the political bias of the site. Right sites
more frequently hosted ads for political products, both on
misinformation and mainstream sites, and both for memo-
rabilia or nonpolitical products using political contexts.
Political News and Media Ads
4.8
We observed 29,409 ads that were related to political news and me-
dia content. At 52.0% of all political ads, this was the most populous
category and accounted for more than either of the other two cate-
gories. Unlike the product ads primarily selling goods or services,
these ads advertised information or information-related services.
We categorize these news and media ads into two groups: those that
advertised specific political news articles, and those that advertised
political outlets, events, or related media. Article ads contained a
range of sensationalized, vacuous, or otherwise misleading content,
especially with “clickbait-y” language that enticed people to click.
Sponsored Content / Direct Article Links. Overall, we find
4.8.1
that most political news and media ads were sponsored content
or links to articles (25,103 ads, 85.4%). Some of these ads reported
substantive content, e.g., linking to a review of a documentary:
“‘All In: The Fight for Democracy’ Tackles the Myth of Widespread
Voter Fraud.” Others were clickbait only using political themes for
attention, e.g., “Tech Guru Makes Massive 2020 Election Prediction.”
Misleading Ads and Headlines. Given that our ads were primarily
