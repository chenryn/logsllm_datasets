**ATT&CK ID:** M1026  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

**Description:**
To enhance security and control over the scheduling of high-priority processes, configure the "Increase Scheduling Priority" option to restrict this right to members of the Administrators group. This can be achieved through Group Policy Objects (GPO) by following these steps:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console.
2. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Local Policies** > **User Rights Assignment**.
3. Locate and double-click on **Increase scheduling priority**.
4. Remove any unnecessary users or groups and ensure that only the **Administrators** group is listed.

This configuration ensures that only authorized administrators can schedule high-priority processes, thereby mitigating the risk of privilege abuse and enhancing overall system security.
