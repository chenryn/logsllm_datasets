**ATT&CK ID:** S1012  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** PowerLess

**Description:**
The PowerLess technique can be used to stage stolen browser data in the file `C:\Windows\Temp\cup.tmp` and keylogger data in the file `C:\Windows\Temp\Report.06E17A5A-7325-4325-8E5D-E172EBA7FC5BK`.[76]

This method allows attackers to collect and temporarily store sensitive information, such as browser credentials and keystrokes, in a location that is less likely to be monitored or detected by security tools.
