Hi there,  
I am evaluating an upgrade to 1.7.1 for our 1.4.4 production cluster. We seem
to be having some data that has geo shapes that 1.4.4 accepted and indexed but
1.7.1 is choking on. The message below is only a warning but it seems to be
rejecting the whole shard to be moved to the newer versioned machine, right?
Can I reduce the level of validation checking for geo locations?
Do we have a breaking change in geo shape validator between these versions?
