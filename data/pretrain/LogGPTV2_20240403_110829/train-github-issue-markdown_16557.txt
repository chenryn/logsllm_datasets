Hello,

I am currently evaluating an upgrade from version 1.4.4 to 1.7.1 for our production cluster. During this process, I have encountered an issue with certain geo shapes that were accepted and indexed by the 1.4.4 version but are causing problems in 1.7.1. The warning message provided below indicates that a shard relocation is being rejected due to these issues.

**Questions:**
1. Is it possible to reduce the level of validation checking for geo locations to allow the upgrade to proceed?
2. Has there been a breaking change in the geo shape validator between versions 1.4.4 and 1.7.1?

**Error Message:**

```

```

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
