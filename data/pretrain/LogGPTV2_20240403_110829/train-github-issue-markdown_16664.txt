# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
My laptop vendor didn't included simple media keys on keyboard. I use PT to
create shortcuts to virtual keys like Media Play/Pause, Volume Up/Down.
In Keyboard Manager there are two options: Remap Keyboard (key to key) and
Remap Shortcuts (key combination to key combination). But when I try to create
shortcut like this:
> Ctrl + Alt + Up => Volume Up  
>  Ctrl + Alt + Down => Volume Down  
>  Ctrl + Alt + Right => Media Play/Pause
I always get an error `Shortcut must start with a modifier key` over target
shortcut key. But in this case, there's no modifier key needed. So I end up
with same combinations with Ctrl, as they work ok:
> Ctrl + Alt + Up => **Ctrl** \+ Volume Up  
>  Ctrl + Alt + Down => **Ctrl** \+ Volume Down  
>  Ctrl + Alt + Right => **Ctrl** \+ Media Play/Pause
I would like to define shortcuts (especially for media keys) without needing
to fake shortcut with Ctrl.
# Proposed technical implementation details
I think the right side of shortcut shouldn't require modifier key. Even
standard keys can be mapped as destination without modifier - if someone want
to type `X` by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Shift + z, this should be allowed.
