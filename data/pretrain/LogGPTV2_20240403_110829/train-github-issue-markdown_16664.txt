# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

My laptop vendor did not include dedicated media keys on the keyboard. To address this, I use PowerToys (PT) to create shortcuts for virtual keys such as Media Play/Pause, Volume Up, and Volume Down. 

In the Keyboard Manager, there are two options: "Remap Keyboard" (key to key) and "Remap Shortcuts" (key combination to key combination). However, when I attempt to create the following shortcuts:
- `Ctrl + Alt + Up` => Volume Up
- `Ctrl + Alt + Down` => Volume Down
- `Ctrl + Alt + Right` => Media Play/Pause

I consistently receive an error message stating, "Shortcut must start with a modifier key" over the target shortcut key. In this scenario, no additional modifier key is needed. As a workaround, I have resorted to using the same combinations but with an extra `Ctrl` key, which works:
- `Ctrl + Alt + Up` => `Ctrl` + Volume Up
- `Ctrl + Alt + Down` => `Ctrl` + Volume Down
- `Ctrl + Alt + Right` => `Ctrl` + Media Play/Pause

I would like to define these shortcuts (especially for media keys) without the need to include an extra `Ctrl` key.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details

The destination side of the shortcut should not require a modifier key. Even standard keys should be mappable as destinations without a modifier. For example, if someone wants to type `X` by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Z`, this should be allowed. This flexibility will enhance the usability of the Keyboard Manager and allow for more intuitive and efficient key remapping.
