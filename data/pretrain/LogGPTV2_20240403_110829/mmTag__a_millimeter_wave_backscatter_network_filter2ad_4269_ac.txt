Figure 6: Polarization Conversion. (a) if the polarization of
the received signal is in X direction, mmTag‚Äôs node change

might be aligned to neither X nor Y direction as shown in Fig-
ure 6(a). Therefore, we need to have a design which converts any
incoming polarization to its orthogonal. To solve this problem, we
found that if we design the transmission lines to have 180‚ó¶ phase
difference, the node converts any incoming polarization to its or-
thogonal. To consider why this works, consider an example shown
in Figure 6(b). In this example, if we exchange the value of X and Y
and rotate X by 180‚ó¶, the reflected signal will be orthogonal to the
received signal. Therefore, our design enables the node to change
the signal polarization to its orthogonal one and reflect it back
regardless of the angle or orientation of the node respect to the
AP. It is worth mentioning that in most backscatter systems, nodes
have linear polarization and therefore their readers have to use

circularly polarized antennas to enable robustness to orientation
changes. However, mmTag‚Äôs nodes do not use linear polarization
and work with any orientaiton. Therefore, this enables us to use
linear polarization at the reader side and still provide robustness to
orientation changes. Finally, to provide higher radiation gain and
improve the communication range, instead of using a single patch
antenna for each element, we use two cascaded patch antennas as
shown in Figure 5(c). The cascaded patch antennas have around 60
degree beamwidth, and hence there is no need for beam alignment
in the elevation plane.
In summary, mmTag‚Äôs node uses a passive beam alignment tech-
nique to hear a query signal from the AP. It then modulates the
signal, changes its polarization, and reflects it back toward the di-
rection of the This enables a mmTag node to communicate with
the AP without requiring complex and power hungry hardware
such as full-duplex radios at the AP and phased arrays at the node.
6 LINK BUDGET ANALYSIS
In previous sections, we have described different parts of our design.
Here, we perform a link budget analysis for mmTag. For our analy-
sis, we make the following assumptions. AP transmission power is
12 dBm which is in accordance with the FCC rules [1]. The receiver
antenna has 20 dBi gain. The Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) at the
receiver side provides 20 dB gain. We also consider 4 dB loss for
cables and connections. Finally, each cascaded patch antenna on
the mmTag‚Äôs node provides 8 dBi gain and it has around 1.5 dB loss
due to the transmission lines used for the beamforming.
Considering these parameters, we calculate the power of node‚Äôs
signal at the AP side for different distances between the AP and
the node. Figure 7 shows the result of this analysis for different
size of the node‚Äôs array. The figure shows that as the number of
antenna elements increases, mmTag can support longer ranges and
higher datarates. Therefore, depending on the range, data-rate and
size constraints of an application, one can design a mmTag‚Äôs node
with different number of antenna elements. When the node has 6
elements (where each element is two cascaded patch), the node‚Äôs
signal power is -70 dbm and -82 dBm at 5 m and 10 m, respectively.
Note, considering ASK modulation and BER of 10‚àí3, these signal
powers are high enough to support 1.5 Gbps and 96 Mbps at 5 m
and 10 m, respectively.
7 SUPPORTING MULTIPLE NODES
So far, we explained how a single mmTag node communicates to an
AP. In this section, we explain how mmTag enables multiple nodes
to communicate to an AP. mmTag uses a combination of spacial-
division and time-division multiplexing to enable communication
to multiple nodes. In the following section, we discuss them in more
details.
a) Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM) In this technique, the
AP creates a narrow beam and scans the environment while trans-
mitting a query signal. During this time, each node sends a pre-
defined packet which is used by the AP to identify and find the
direction of each node. Once the AP finds the direction of all nodes,
it establishes communication links to them by focusing its beam
toward them in a round-robin manner. This approach enables the
AP to support all nodes. However, it worth mentioning that if an
Figure 7: Link Budget Analysis
application requires supporting multiple nodes concurrently, one
can simply use MIMO beamforming architecture at the mmTag AP
which enables creating multiple independent beams, each directed
toward a different node.
b) Time Division Multiplexing (SDM) In scenarios where a
large number of nodes are connected to a single AP, there is a
chance that two or more nodes are located in the same direction
respect to the AP. Therefore, their reflected signals collide and
the AP can not decode them. To avoid this, mmTag employs Time
Division Multiplexing. In this scheme, the AP assigns a time slot to
each node to send its data while the other nodes stay silent. The
AP and nodes can use low-power, low-data-rate radios, such as
Bluetooth, to exchange their control information.
8 IMPLEMENTATION
In this section, we describe the implementation of mmTag‚Äôs node
and the mmWave AP‚Äôs setup.
We design mmTag using ANSYS HFSS software. The node is
then fabricated on PCB using standard Rogers 4835 material with
0.18 mm thickness, as shown in Figure 8. The node is integrated with
ADRF5020 SPDT switches that have very low power consumption.
This is the only mmWave IC used in our node, making the design
simple and low-cost. Our design is tuned to cover the whole 24 GHz
mmWave ISM band with 250 MHz bandwidth. However, the same
method and design approach can be used to design a mmTag‚Äôs node
operating at higher frequencies (such as 60 GHz) where 2 GHz of
bandwidth is available. As long as the ratio of bandwidth to center
frequency (fractional bandwidth) is less than 10%, the proposed
beam alignment technique works. The size of mmTag‚Äôs node is
6√ó 5 cm, including 6 antenna elements (where each is two cascaded
path). The node creates a directional beam with 12 degree beam
width. Note, our design can be easily tuned to higher frequency
bands (such as 60 GHz) which results in even smaller antennas.2
For the mmWave AP, we use a signal generator and a spectrum
2The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength, and therefore the smaller the
antennas.

the result of our evaluation. The figure shows the S11 of a single
element of the node when its switch is in state 0 and state 1. When
the switch is state 1, S11 is less than -15 dB at the carrier frequency.
This implies that antenna is tuned. Therefore, in this mode, the
antenna works properly and the node receives the mmWave signal
from the AP and reflects it back in the same direction. On the other
hand, when the switch turns to state 0, the figure shows the S11 is
as high as -5 dB at the carrier frequency. Such a high S11 means
that the antenna is not tuned. Therefore, the antenna does not work
in this mode and it does not receive nor reflect the AP‚Äôs signal. This
evaluation confirms that our node is able to modulate and reflect
the mmWave signal.
Passive Beamforming: As mentioned in Section 4, mmTag‚Äôs
node reflects back the signal toward the AP, regardless of the in-
cidence angle. Here, we empirically evaluate the nodes ability in
performing this. To do so, we run an experiment where we place
the node at 1 m from the AP and rotate the node in the azimuth
direction as shown in Figure 10 while measuring the power of the
reflected signal. Figure 11 shows the normalized received power
from the node versus rotation angles. For comparison, we also show
the received power if we were using a wide-beam single antenna
(yellow plot) or a fixed-beam antenna array (red plot) instead of
our design. The figure shows that our design experiences much
lower power loss in the reflected signal. This implies that the node
can perform passive beam forming toward the AP, regardless of its
angle with respect to the AP.
Polarization Conversion: Here, we evaluate if using orthogo-
nal polarization helps mmTag to solve the self-interference problem
of the AP. We ran an experiment where the AP is continuously
transmitting a query signal while also measuring the power of
the received signal (i.e. self-interference) at the receiver antenna.
We performed this experiment for two scenarios: (a) the AP used
antennas with orthogonal polarization for transmitting and receiv-
ing, and (b) the AP used antennas with the same polarization for
transmitting and receiving. Our results shows that the power of

analyzer, and connect them to directional antennas to transmit
and receive 24 GHz signals. The AP‚Äôs average transmission power
(including the transmitter antenna‚Äôs gain) is 12 dBm. Note, the peak
transmission power can be higher if the AP performs duty cycling.
We use an LNA with 25 dB gain for the AP‚Äôs receiver.
9 EVALUATION
We evaluated the performance of mmTag in different locations,
angles, and orientations. We ran experiments in an indoor environ-
ment where shelves and tables were present around the measure-
ment area.
9.1 Microbenchmarks
Switched Antenna Performance We first evaluate our node‚Äôs
ability in modulating and reflecting a signal. As described in Sec-
tion 4.3, we use low power SPDT switches to switch the node
between two modes: reflective and non-reflective. Figure 9 shows

for different orientation angles. As discussed in Section 5, mmTag
uses a novel antenna and feed network design which converts any
incoming signal polarization to its orthogonal, and hence, it can
communicate to the AP regardless of orientation of the node. To
evaluate this capability, we run an experiment where we place
the node at 1 m from the AP. We then measure the power of the
reflected signal from the node at the AP, while we rotate the node
around its x-axis as shown in Figure 10. The normalized received
power is shown in Figure 12. For comparison, we also plot the
received power if we were using a typical patch antenna instead
of our design. This result shows that mmTag‚Äôs node experiences
less than 3 dB loss across all different rotation angles. On the other
hand, if we were just using a typical patch antenna which does not
change the polarization, we would experience much higher loss.
This result implies that the node can reflect the signal and enable
robust communication to the AP, regardless of its orientation.
9.2 mmTag‚Äôs Range Performance
Next, we evaluate the performance of mmTag as a communication
link for different distances of a node from the AP. In this experi-
ment, the AP transmits a query signal to the node and measures
the power of the signal reflected back from the node. Figure 13
shows the result of this experiment for different distances between
the node and AP. The figure also shows the noise floor of the AP
for different bandwidths as well as the node‚Äôs maximum data-rate
for some ranges.3 Note, there is currently 250 MHz of ISM band
available at 24 GHz which can support up to 125 Mbps. Therefore,
in order to evaluate our system for higher data-rates, the received
powers are measured empirically and the corresponding data-rates
are computed by substituting the power measurements and the
noise floor into standard data-rate tables based on the ASK modu-
lation and BER of 10‚àí3, which is a typical BER for most backscatter
systems. 4 Note, mmTag‚Äôs BER can be improved by increasing the
number of antenna elements on the node, or operating at lower
datarate or shorter range. Our results show that mmTag provides
more than 1 Gbps data rate when the node is less than 4.65 m from
the AP. The figure also shows that increasing the distance reduces
the node‚Äôs signal power. However, mmTag can still provide 100
Mbps and 10 Mbps at even 8 m and 14 m, respectively. Note, our
empirical results are based on transmit power of 12 dbm, includ-
ing the antenna gain. In order to achieve longer range or higher
data-rate, one can duty cycle the transmission of the query signal
while keeping the average transmission power at 12 dbm which
complies with FCC regulation [1]. Figure 13 shows the results when
the query signal is 10% duty cycled. In this case, mmTag achieves
the maximum data rate of 1 Gbps even at 8 m distance. Finally, it
is worth mentioning that our current node design has 6 antenna
elements. The range and and data-rate can be increased further by
designing a node with more elements.
3mmTag‚Äôs AP uses CMD298C4 LNA which has Noise Figure (NF) of 1.4 dB. The
AP‚Äôs noise floor is computed based this Noise Figure and thermal noise at the room
temperature (i.e.300 K).
4ASK modulation requires SNR of 7 dB to achieve BER of 10‚àí3 [13].
Figure 11: mmTag‚Äôs Passive beamforming performance.
mmTag‚Äôs node reflects the signal back to the direction of the
AP while experiencing minor loss across different angles re-
spect to the AP. The figure also shows that the loss would be
much higher if a fixed-beam array or a single antenna was
used instead of mmTag‚Äôs design.

self-interference signal in the first scenario is 31 dB lower than in
the second scenario. This result implies that mmTag can signifi-
cantly reduce the impact of the self-interference problem, resulting
in a significant improvement in the operating range.
However, for this approach to work, the node must always be
able to change the polarization of the signal. Next, we evaluate the
performance of the mmTag node in changing the signal polarization
