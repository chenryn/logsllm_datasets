User: I'm writing a python script on Linux (debian) to install a few things, reboot, and then do more things.
I'm not sure if it's possible, but would I be able to say,
run all of my installers, reboot and resume my script from where it left off?
I would like for the user to not have to do anything (even log onto the machine, if at all possible)
Oh! Also, is there a way to keep(or Store) variables without storing them in plaintext?
Thanks!
Assistant: One more way to execute your script at booting time by adding below line to root's crontab
@reboot /usr/bin/python /root/simple.py
simple.py  -- script need to be executed.
