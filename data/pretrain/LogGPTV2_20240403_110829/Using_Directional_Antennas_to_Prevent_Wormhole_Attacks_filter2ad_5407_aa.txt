Using Directional Antennas to Prevent Wormhole Attacks 
Abstract 
Wormhole  attacks  enable  an  attacker  with  limited 
resources and no cryptographic material to wreak havoc 
on  wireless  networks.    To  date,  no  general  defenses 
against  wormhole  attacks  have  been  proposed.    This 
paper  presents  an  analysis  of  wormhole  attacks  and 
proposes  a  countermeasure  using  directional  antennas.   
We  present  a  cooperative  protocol  whereby  nodes  share 
directional  information  to  prevent  wormhole  endpoints 
from  masquerading  as  false  neighbors.    Our  defense 
greatly  diminishes  the  threat  of  wormhole  attacks  and 
requires no location information or clock synchronization.   
1. Introduction 
Wireless ad hoc networks have properties that increase 
their vulnerability to attacks. Wireless links are inherently 
vulnerable  to  eavesdropping  and  message  injection,  as 
well  as  jamming  attacks. 
  Constraints  in  memory, 
computing  power,  and  battery  power  in  mobile  devices 
can  impose  trade-offs  between  security  and  resource 
consumption.   
Routing  in  ad  hoc  wireless  networks  is  an  especially 
hard task to accomplish securely, robustly and efficiently.   
Many proposed routing protocols are focused on energy, 
and  provide  no  protection  against  an  adversary.    Some 
secure  routing  protocols  also  have  been  proposed.   
However, due to the unpredictability of ad hoc networks, it 
is  hard  to  detect  behavior  anomalies  in  route  discovery.   
In  particular,  proposed  routing  protocols  cannot  prevent 
wormhole  attacks.    In  a  wormhole  attack,  an  attacker 
introduces  two  transceivers  into  a  wireless  network  and 
connects  them  with  a  high  quality,  low-latency  link.   
Routing messages received by one wormhole endpoint are 
retransmitted at the other endpoint.    Attackers can exploit 
wormholes  to  build  bogus  route  information,  selectively 
drop packets, and create routing loops to waste the energy 
of network.                                       
Wireless  ad  hoc  networks  typically  assume  omni-
directional antennas.    In this paper, we consider devices 
with  directional  antennas.    Directional  antennas  have 
been shown to improve efficiency and capacity of wireless 
networks.    Several  MAC  protocols  [4,  14,  12,  20]  and 
routing protocols [5, 2, 17] have been proposed that take 
advantage of directional antennas.

performance,  and  Section  7  analyzes  the  impact  of

2. Background 
that 
secures 
the  SRP  protocol 
Several secure routing protocols have been proposed for 
wireless ad hoc networks.    Papadimitratos and Haas [23] 
present 
against 
non-colluding adversaries by disabling route caching and 
providing  end-to-end  authentication  using  an  HMAC 
primitive. SEAD [7] uses one-way hash chains to provide 
authentication  for  DSDV  [21].    Ariadne  [8]  uses  an 
authenticated broadcast technique [22] to achieve similar 
security  goals  on  DSR  [11].  Marti  et  al.  [16]  examine 
techniques  to  minimize  the  effect  of  misbehaving  nodes 
through node snooping and reporting, but it is vulnerable 
to blackmail attacks. ARRIVE [13] proposes probabilistic 
multi-path  routing  instead  of  single  path  algorithm  to 
enhance the robustness of routing.    These secure routing 
protocols  are  still  vulnerable to wormhole  attacks which 
can  be  conducted  without  having  access 
to  any 
cryptographic keys.   
Wormhole attacks depend on a node misrepresenting its 
location.    Hence,  location  based  routing  protocols  have 
the  potential 
[15].   
to  prevent  wormhole  attacks 
Localization  may  be  done  using  globally  accessible 
beacons  that  broadcast  known  locations  (that  may  be 
pre-configured or determined using GPS [29]).    Recently 
there has been some research to build localization system 
using  localized  protocols  [19,  1,  10,  18].    The  location 
service itself may become the attack target.    Localization 
systems generally require some seed nodes that know their 
own positions, which may not be possible in all network 
environments.    Sastry,  Shankar,  and  Wagner  propose  a 
protocol that verifies a node is located within a particular 
region [28].    If an attacker acquires a wormhole endpoint 
within the region, the attacker could make other nodes also 
appear  to  be  within  the  region.    An  adversary  who 
acquires  a  wormhole  endpoint  within  the  region  has 
already violated their security requirements.   
A previous approach for detecting wormhole attacks is 
to use packet leashes [9].    A temporal packet leash places 
a bound on the lifetime of a packet that restricts its travel 
distance.    The sender includes the transmission time and 
location  information  in  the  message,  and  the  receiver 
checks  that  the  packet  could  have  traveled  the  distance 
between  the  sender  and  itself  within  the  time  between 
reception  and  transmission.    Since  radio  transmissions 
travel at the speed of light, temporal packet leashes require 
tightly 
location 
knowledge. 
synchronized  clocks  and  precise 
Our  approach  to  preventing  wormhole  attacks  is  for 
nodes  to  maintain  accurate  information  about  their 
neighbors (nodes within one hop communication distance).   
This is simpler than using location since each node need 
only maintain a set of its neighboring nodes.    A message 
from a non-neighboring node is ignored by the recipient.   
Note that any protocol used to maintain accurate neighbor 
sets may itself be vulnerable to wormhole attacks, so our 
goal is to design a neighborhood discovery protocol that is 
not vulnerable to wormhole attacks.    The security of our 
protocol will rely on using directional antennas to obtain 
relative  direction  information,  and  cooperation  among 
nodes to verify possible neighbors.     
3. Wormhole Attacks 
In  a  wormhole  attack,  an  attacker  forwards  packets 
through a high quality out-of-band link and replays those 
packets at another location in the network [9, 15].    Figure 
1  shows  a  basic  wormhole  attack.    The  attacker replays 
packets  received  by  X  at  node  Y,  and  vice  versa.    If  it 
would normally take several hops for a packet to traverse 
from  a  location  near  X  to  a  location  near  Y,  packets 
transmitted  near  X  traveling  through  the  wormhole  will 
arrive at Y before packets traveling through multiple hops 
in the network.    The attacker can make A and B believe 
they  are  neighbors by  forwarding routing messages,  and 
then 
to  disrupt 
communications between A and B.     
selectively  drop  data  messages

  The 
adversary  controls  nodes  X  and  Y  and 
connects them through a low-latency link.     
For  most  routing  protocols,  the  attack  has  impact  on 
nodes  beyond  the  wormhole  endpoints’  neighborhoods 
also.    Node A will advertise a one-hop path to B so that C 
will direct packets towards B through A.    For example, in 
on-demand routing protocols (DSR [11] and AODV [24]) 
or  secure  on-demand  routing  protocols  (SEAD  [7], 
Ariadne  [8],  SRP  [23]),  the  wormhole  attack  can  be 
mounted  by  tunneling  ROUTE  REQUEST  messages 
directly  to  nodes  near  the  destination  node.    Since  the 
ROUTE  REQUEST  message  is  tunneled  through  high 
quality  channel,  it  arrives  earlier  than  other  requests. 
According  to  the  protocol,  other  ROUTE  REQUEST 
messages  received  for  the  same  route  discovery  will  be 
discarded.    This  attack  thus  prevents  any  other  routes 
from  being  discovered,  and  the  wormhole will  have  full 
control  of  the  route.    The  attacker  can  discard  all 
messages  to  create  a  denial-of-service  attack,  or  more 
subtly,  selectively  discard  certain  messages  to  alter  the 
function  of  the  network.    An  attacker  with  a  suitable 
wormhole  can  easily  create  a  sinkhole  that  attracts  (but 
does  not  forward)  packets  to  many  destinations.    An 
intelligent  attacker  may  be  able  to  selectively  forward 
messages to enable other attacks. 
To  show  how  much  damage  a  single  wormhole  can 
cause  to  routing,  we  simulated  randomly  distributing 
nodes  in  a  rectangular region  and  used  the  shortest path 
algorithm to find the best route between any node pairs.   
If a wormhole is formed, some far away nodes will appear 
to be neighbors and some node pairs will be able to find a 
“shorter”  path  through  the  wormhole.    Hence  the  route 
between  them  is  disrupted  by  the  wormhole. 
  In 
simulation  experiments,  a  single  wormhole  with  two 
randomly  placed  endpoints  disrupts  over  5%  of  all 
network routes. 
A  more  intelligent  attacker  may  be  able  to  place 
wormhole endpoints at particular locations.    Strategically 
placed  wormhole  endpoints  can  disrupt  nearly  all 
communications  to  or  from  a  certain  node  and  all  other 
nodes  in  the  network.    In  sensor  network  applications, 
where  most  communications  are  directed  from  sensor 
nodes to a common base station, wormhole attacks can be 
particularly  devastating.    If  the  base  station  is  at  the 
corner of the network, a wormhole with one endpoint near

strategically  placed  node  can  disrupt  a 
substantial  fraction  of  communications.  The 
position  of

means the second endpoint is at the center of 
the network; 0 means it is in the bottom left 
corner). 
the base station and the other endpoint one hop away will 
be able to attract nearly all traffic from sensor nodes to the 
base  station.    If  the  base  station  is  at  the  center  of  the 
network, a single wormhole will be able to attract traffic 
from  a  quadrant  of  the  network.    Figure  2  shows  the 
effectiveness of a wormhole in disrupting communications 
from sensor nodes to a base station.    One endpoint of the 
wormhole  is  within  one  hop  of  the  base  station;  the 
position  of  the  second  endpoint  varies  along  the  x  axis.   
When  the  base  station  is  in  a  corner  of  the  network,  a 
wormhole with the second endpoint near the base station 
can  effectively  disrupt  all  network  communications.    If 
the  second  endpoint  is  placed  in  the  opposite  corner, 
approximately half of the nodes in the network will send 
messages for the base station to the wormhole. 
4. Directional Antennas 
Directional  antenna  systems  are  increasingly  being 
recognized as a powerful way for increasing the capacity 
and connectivity of ad hoc networks [25, 26]. Transmitting 
in particular directions results in a higher degree of spatial 
reuse  of  the  shared  medium.    Further,  directional  trans-
mission  uses  energy  more  efficiently.    The  transmission 
range of directional antennas is usually larger than that of 
omnidirectional antennas, which can reduce hops for rout-
ing and make originally unconnected devices connected.   
into 
switched and steered antennas systems.    Steered antennas 
provide fine directional control, but are too expensive for 
most  sensor  network  applications.    Switched  antennas 
provide  less  precise  directional  control,  but  can  be 
inexpensive  and  moderately  small,  particularly  at  COTS 
Antenna  systems  may  be  broadly  classified 
frequencies  such  as  2.4GHz or  5  GHz [27].  In  switched 
antenna systems, one of several fixed directional antennas 
can be selected using a switch. The transceiver can then 
choose  between  one  or  more  beams  for  transmitting  or 
receiving [25]. 
Most  work  on  directional  antennas  has  focused  on 
media  access  protocols  [14,  12,  4,  20].    Directional  an-
tennas  can  increase  spatial  reuse  and  reduce  packet 
collisions  and  negative  effects  such  as  deafness  [4].   
Routing  protocols  using  directional  antennas  can  out-
perform omnidirectional routing protocols [2, 5, 17].    In 
this  paper,  we  show  that  directional  antennas  also  have 
security  benefits.    In  particular,  directional  information 
can be used to mitigate wormhole attacks.     
We  adopt  the  antenna  model  in  [5].    The  model 
assumes  an  antenna  with  N  zones.    Each  zone  has  a 
conical  radiation  pattern,  spanning  an  angle  of  2π/N 
radians.    The zones are fixed with non-overlapping beam 
directions, so that the N zones may collectively cover the 
entire plane as shown in Figure 3.    When a node is idle, it
