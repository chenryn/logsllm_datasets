### Taylor’s Disclaimer
I am about to critique some individuals, so I feel it is appropriate to provide an explanation and a semblance of an apology in advance.

Despite the implications in the following slides, there are indeed many intelligent and competent professionals in the field of penetration testing. These individuals, whether certified or not, genuinely understand what they are doing. However, this presentation is not about them.

Instead, it focuses on those who call themselves penetration testers but lack the necessary skills and knowledge. My aim is to discuss how we can improve the industry and prevent these unqualified individuals from tarnishing the reputation of the entire field.

Sincerely,
- Taylor

## Part 1: The Penetration Test is Dead

### 1.1 History of the Penetration Test

#### Timeline
- **1970s**: Captain Crunch, Vint Cerf, Blue Boxes, Catch-22
- **1980s**: CCC, 414s, WarGames, LoD, MoD, CoDC, 2600, Phrack, Morris Worm, Mitnick v MIT/DEC, Poulsen, CERT
- **1990s**: Sundevil, EFF, LOD vs MOD, Poulsen, Sneakers, DEF CON, AOHell, Mitnick, The Net, Hackers, MP3, RIAA, Back Orifice, L0pht, Melissa
- **2000-2008**: ILOVEYOU, Dmitry Sklyarov, DMCA, Code Red, Paris Hilton’s Sidekick, XSS, Storm Worm, Web2.x, AJAX

#### Semantics
- We are discussing "classic" network-based penetration testing.
- This does not include zero-day vulnerability development or on-the-fly reverse engineering.

#### Brief History
- Early penetration testing was a niche and secretive practice.
- Information security was poorly understood, except by a few experts.
- Key texts like "The Hacker Manifesto" and "Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into It" provided early insights into the hacker mindset and security practices.

#### Notable Works
- **The Hacker Manifesto** by The Mentor
- **Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into It** by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema

#### More History
- **Sterling’s “The Cuckoo’s Egg”**: Documents the discovery, identification, and arrest of a cracker.
- **Bill Cheswick’s “An Evening with Berferd In Which a Cracker is Lured, Endured and Studied”**: Provides insights into cracker behavior.
- **Chris Klaus’s Internet Scanner 1.x**: An early tool for network scanning.
- **Cheswick and Bellovin’s “Firewalls and Internet Security”**: A foundational text on network security.

#### War Stories
- **Public School System (circa 2000)**: A penetration test revealed thousands of vulnerabilities, including blank or weak passwords, poor architecture, and unpatched systems.
- **Other Vulnerabilities**: IIS Unicode, Solaris TTYPROMPT, froot, blank passwords, 'sa', Administrator.

#### Early Methodologies
- Initially, there was no commonly accepted methodology.
- I developed my own methodologies, which were used successfully by three companies.
- In late 2000, Pete Herzog released the first version of the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM).

#### Job Security Through Process Obscurity
- The lack of a standardized methodology led to significant differences in penetration tests.
- This inconsistency made it difficult for organizations to trust the results.
- Embracing the OSSTMM helped ensure a basic set of best practices and business ethics.

#### Progress
- Various organizations and frameworks have emerged to standardize penetration testing:
  - ISACA
  - ISECOM
  - CHECK
  - OWASP
  - ISAAF
  - NSA
  - TIGERSCHEME

### 1.2 Penetration Testing Goes Mainstream

- By 2000, penetration testing gained widespread appeal.
- Assessment tools like Nmap, SuperScanner, Nessus, Cain & Abel, and Metasploit improved in effectiveness and ease of use.
- With more accessible tools, more practitioners emerged, though many lacked experience and methodology.

#### Hacking in the Movies
- **WarGames, Sneakers, Hackers, The Matrix, Swordfish, Antitrust, Takedown**

#### The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum
- The industry is filled with individuals who believe they are good hackers, often due to ego rather than skill.
- Becoming a good penetration tester requires more than just tools; it requires understanding the mindset of an attacker.

#### Training and Education
- **Early Education (pre-2000)**: Limited but generally good.
- **Current Education**: Many training programs and certifications exist, but most are subpar and focus on tools rather than methodology.
- **Notable Books**: Hacking Exposed, Shellcoders Handbook, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, Grayhat Hacking, Google Hacking for Penetration Testers.

#### Apologies
- To those who are truly skilled, you are the exception. For the rest, if you felt offended by the previous points, you might be one of the individuals relying too heavily on certifications and tools.

#### On Regurgitation
- I have heard my war stories retold by others. If I catch you using one of my stories, I will make every effort to ridicule and humiliate you publicly.

#### "Scan Now" Pentests
- Many modern penetration tests are little more than automated scans, producing thousands of pages of worthless results.
- The value lies in the methodology and the human element, not just the tools.

#### Conclusion: Why Yesterday's Pentest is Worthless
- Security is a process, not a project.
- Lack of a standardized methodology.
- Inconsistency in testing approaches.
- Early pentests were ad hoc.
- Mainstream adoption and media portrayal.
- Books, classes, and certifications.

## Part 2: Long Live the Penetration Test!

### 2.1 The Value of the Penetration Test
- Penetration testing remains a critical component of security assessments.
- It provides real-world insights into vulnerabilities and helps organizations prioritize remediation efforts.

### 2.2 Evolution of the Penetration Test
- The field has evolved to include more sophisticated techniques and a broader scope.
- Modern penetration testing includes web applications, mobile devices, and cloud environments.

### 2.3 A Framework for Repeatable Testing
- Standardized methodologies like the OSSTMM ensure consistency and reliability.
- A repeatable process allows for better comparison and tracking of security improvements over time.

### 2.4 Penetration Testing in the 21st Century and Beyond
- The future of penetration testing involves integrating automation with human expertise.
- Continuous testing and real-time monitoring will become more prevalent.
- Collaboration and sharing of threat intelligence will enhance the effectiveness of penetration testing.

---

## Conclusions
- The penetration test is not dead; it is evolving.
- Standardization and a focus on methodology are crucial for the future of the field.
- The industry must continue to improve and adapt to new threats and technologies.
