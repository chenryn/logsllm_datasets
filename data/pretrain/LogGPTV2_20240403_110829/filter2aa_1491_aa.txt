Taylor’s [Don’t Give Me Bad Reviews Because I Made Fun of You] Disclaimer:
I’m about to really rip on some folks, so I ﬁgure I might as well offer an explanation, 
(and some semblance of an apology) in advance.
Contrary to implications in later slides, there ARE actually a handful of really smart 
people doing pentests, writing books about pentests and teaching classes on 
pentesting, who despite their certiﬁcations (or lack thereof) actually know WTF they 
are doing.
Those are not the people I’m talking about.
This presentation picks on the other douchebags who call themselves pentesters. As 
such, I plan to talk about what you (and I) can do to take the industry back from the 
shameless charlatans who’ve almost been successful in giving the rest of us a bad 
name.
Yours very sincerely,
-Taylor

on semantics
we’re talking about “classic” [network-based] 
penetration testing
we’re not talking about 0-day vulndev, 
on-the-ﬂy reversing, etc
(if that’s what you were looking for, you can skip 
out to the bar now)

a brief history: the pentest
11
early pentesting was a black art
nobody saw the need; employees were trusted
information security was poorly understood,
except by the learned few
The Hacker Manifesto
by The Mentor
Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into It
by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema

the hacker manifesto
Says The Mentor, “I am a hacker, enter my world…”
Provides a voice that transforms a sub-culture:
“Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that 
of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look 
like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will 
never forgive me for.”

“A young boy, with greasy blonde hair, sitting in a dark room. The 
room is illuminated only by the luminescense [sic] of the C64's 40 
character screen. Taking another long drag from his Benson and 
Hedges cigarette, the weary system cracker telnets to the next 
faceless ".mil" site on his hit list. "guest -- guest", "root -- root", 
and "system -- manager" all fail. No matter. He has all night... he 
pencils the host off of his list, and tiredly types in the next potential 
victim…”

enough history, i thought 
there were war stories?!
once upon a time…
pentest, circa 2000
public school system with sql server, public i/f, sa no passwd
thousands of vulns, top ﬁndings:
blank or weak passwords, poor architecture and perimeter defenses, 
unpatched systems, open ﬁle shares, no formal security program or 
awareness efforts
what grade would you like today?

other fun shit...
that used to work

Solaris TTYPROMPT
froot
blank passwords
‘sa’

whitehats by day… 
early on, true penetration testing skills were learned mostly in 
and amongst small, underground communities
those who were good were often that way because their hat’s 
weren’t always white

early methodologies
when i began performing penetration tests professionally, there 
was no semblance of a commonly-accepted methodology, so 
i wrote my own
in fact, i wrote methodologies used successfully by three 
companies based entirely on my own early experiences
in late 2000, pete herzog (ideahamster) released the ﬁrst 
version of the open source security testing methodology 
manual (the OSSTMM - like awesome with a T in the middle)
19
18
19
osstmm v1.x
the earliest editions of the osstmm were helpful, and showed 
promise, but had a long way to go before they would replace 
my own hand-written process/procedure documentation
even still, the effort was laudable, as no other similar effort of 
any signiﬁcance otherwise existed
20

20
a service in search of a 
methodology
the real problem with a generally-accepted methodology, 
however, was rooted in ruthless competition
in 2001 there was a lot of money in pentesting, and a lot of 
competition for the mid and large enterprise
in other words, it was “job security through process obscurity”
if you were good at what you did, as long as nobody else 
could produce as thorough results with as effective 
remediation recommendations, you won ;)
21
20
21
a stain on your practice
unfortunately, “job security through process obscurity” 
ultimately hurt us all, as not only were no two pentests alike, 
but they were often so radically different that no one could feel 
conﬁdent or secure with only a single organization’s results
and if it ain’t repeatable, it ain’t a pentest… it’s just a hack
thus it was time to embrace the osstmm to help ensure a 
basic set of best practices, necessary processes, and general 
business ethics that anyone worth their salt should possess

so where does 
pentesting ﬁt?
we don’t know, but pentesting is cool!
(more on this later)

1.2
pentesting goes mainstream
24
25
pentesting goes 
mainstream
by 2000, pentesting began to gain more widespread appeal
assessment tools have come a long way since then
(hell, even portscanners used to be a pain in the ass) 
their effectiveness, efﬁciency and ease of use have improved:
take nmap, superscanner, nessus, caine/abel, metasploit
with easier and more readily available tools, more practitioners 
emerge, though most lack both experience and methodology

the lunatics have taken 
over the asylum!
you better get used to it
in this segment of this industry, you’ll likely compete with idiots
why? because there are thousands of people who mistakenly 
believe they’re good hackers (this audience of course excluded ;)
unfortunately, although ego is often a by-product of a good 
hacker (or maybe even a factor of?), i can guarantee that ego 
alone does not a good hacker make
28
27
28
so how did i become a 
pentester then?
With Internet texts and a series of good mentors :)
The Rainbow Series, always a good place to start
“Smashing the Stack for Fun and Proﬁt” by Aleph One
“How to Become a Hacker” by ESR
IRC and underground websites 
(just take everything with a grain of salt)
understanding the process of an attack; not just the tools and the 
vulns… but the actual mindset one must achieve to circumvent

hacking training:
the good, the bad, the ugly
30
Early on (pre-2000), your choices were few, but the education 
was generally good
Good, but not great
For the most part, we were teaching tools with a basic 
[prescribed] formula for using those tools to explore common 
network security deﬁciencies
But we weren’t teaching a methodology, because:
It was difﬁcult to teach someone to “think like a hacker” in only 5 days
A good (and commonly accepted) methodology didn’t yet exist
29
30
hacking training continued
Unfortunately, nowadays, there are a zillion companies who 
will teach you “applied hacking,” “penetration testing,” “ethical 
hacking,” and other such crap
Few of them actually know what they’re doing 
Most are “certiﬁed” but lack real experience.
They’ll teach you nmap and offer you 80 hours of “bootcamp-style” 
rhetoric, but they can’t teach you to be a good pentester.
(In fact, of the dozen or so “C|EH instructors” I’ve met, only 3 had 
ever actually performed a penetration test for hire. OMGWTF?)
31

31
hacking books
Hacking Exposed. Good book, set the bar pretty high.
Nonetheless, a million other “hacking books” followed, and as 
with “hacking training,” many (most) of them sucked. 
I have at least a dozen crappy books that are basically re-worked 
re-writes of each other… teaching the same old tools in the 
same old way, with the same old screenshots.
A few notable exceptions: shellcoders handbook, hacking: the 
art of exploitation, grayhat hacking, google hacking for 
pentesters
32
31
32
hacking certiﬁcations
No, seriously, are you really proud of that?
All certiﬁcations, given time, become worthless due to brain dumps and 
study guides. 
Assuming they weren’t worthless to begin with. 
 Does a tool-based class & tool-based cert really prove your skill-set?
I posit that “certiﬁed hacker” is almost as good as a note from your mom (but 
not quite). Who exactly is really qualiﬁed to certify a hacker?  
I’ve never seen a test, multiple choice or otherwise, that could even hope 
to identify a good hacker. Especially one with an 80% pass-rate at the 
conclusion of a 5-day class. Get real.
33

apologies
Yeah, yeah, ok.
I’m sorry to those of you who do actually know what you’re 
doing. You are the notable few, you’re smarter than your 
peers, you’re a dying breed, blah blah blah. (remember my 
disclaimer?)
The rest of you know who you are. If your face turned beet red 
during that last slide, you’re probably one of the people who 
thinks that a “hacking instructor certiﬁcation” makes you an 
expert. Do you seriously believe that crap?
34

on regurgitation
i’ve heard “war stories” about pentests that i performed told by 
more than a handful of other “hacking instructors” (many of whom 
attended my classes) across the course of the past several years
if i ever catch you using one of my stories, i can assure you that i 
will make every effort to ridicule and humiliate you, publicly ;)

“scan now” pentests
from the “scan now” button in internet scanner
clients get a report with thousands of vulnerabilities with subjective risk 
ratings
does not account for the environment, network architecture or asset 
value
little guidance, no strategy, limited value
many of the “pentests” currently being delivered are little more than 
“scan now” tests; they are ultimately in-depth vulnerability scans 
that produce thousands of pages of worthless results
36

36
bottom line:
it’s not about the tools!

another story. goody.
pentest for a banker’s bank (that’s a bank that provides services only 
to other banks)
external pentest was helpful, but not revelatory
onsite pentest, however, revealed:
several oddly named accounts on an internal webserver; after two hours of 
password cracking, only a non-admin password was revealed. 
heartbroken, i continued on.
20 minutes and about three guesses later, variations on my non-admin 
password gave me admin access to:
domain controllers, dns servers, core routers, and ﬁrewalls. game over
38
37
38
conclusion: why yesterday’s 
pentest is worthless
39
security is a process, not a project
lacking a methodology
no two tests are alike
early pentests were very adhoc
pentesting goes mainstream
hacking in the movies
books, classes and certiﬁcations
38
Part 2
long live the pentest!
