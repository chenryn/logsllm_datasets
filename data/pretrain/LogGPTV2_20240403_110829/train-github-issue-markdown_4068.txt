  1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?  
`go version go1.6 linux/amd64`
  2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?
        GOARCH="amd64"
    GOHOSTARCH="amd64"
    GOHOSTOS="linux"
    GOOS="linux"
    GORACE=""
    GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT="1"
    CC="gcc"
    GOGCCFLAGS="-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fmessage-length=0"
    CXX="g++"
    CGO_ENABLED="1"
  3. What did you do?  
When the `go test` command, with the `-coverprofile` flag, needs to compile a
source file, it reports errors using an incorrect line number.
The problem can be reproduced running  
`$go test -coverprofile=/tmp/out`  
with this source file:  
https://play.golang.org/p/WAB6gv-0HC  
and test file:  
https://play.golang.org/p/LCkNJTTOQ1
  4. What did you expect to see?
        # test/bug01
    /tmp/go-build602734163/test/bug01/_test/_obj_test/bug.go:6: undefined: fmt.Printz
    FAIL    test/bug01 [build failed]
  5. What did you see instead?
        # test/bug01
    /tmp/go-build602734163/test/bug01/_test/_obj_test/bug.go:7: undefined: fmt.Printz
    FAIL    test/bug01 [build failed]
