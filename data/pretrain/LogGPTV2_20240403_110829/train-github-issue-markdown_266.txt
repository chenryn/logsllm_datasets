I am experiencing an issue on my live website, [www.studiotaroccomanta.com](http://www.studiotaroccomanta.com).

When the main menu is collapsed and closed, clicking the button to open it works correctly for the first-level entries. However, when I view the "ATTIVITA'" submenu on a mobile device, leave it open, and then try to click on another first-level menu item (such as "CONTATTI"), the submenu simply closes without redirecting me to the correct page.

Do you have any suggestions or ideas on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
