I have a live website with the problem here: www.studiotaroccomanta.com
If the main menu is collapsed and closed, when I click the button to open it
everything works fine for the first level entries.  
But when I visualize the submenu "ATTIVITA'" on mobile, leave it open, and
then try to click one of the other FIRST level menu (like "CONTATTI"), the
submenu simply close, staying on the current page, aka without redirecting me
to the correct page.
Any ideas?
