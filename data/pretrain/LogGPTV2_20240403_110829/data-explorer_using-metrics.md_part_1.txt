# Monitor Azure Data Explorer performance, health, and usage with metrics
Azure Data Explorer metrics provide key indicators as to the health and performance of the Azure Data Explorer cluster resources. Use the metrics that are detailed in this article to monitor Azure Data Explorer cluster usage, health, and performance in your specific scenario as standalone metrics. You can also use metrics as the basis for operational [Azure Dashboards](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards) and [Azure Alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts).
For more information about Azure Metrics Explorer, see [Metrics Explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started).
## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-and-database.md).
## Use metrics to monitor your Azure Data Explorer resources
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. In the left-hand pane of your Azure Data Explorer cluster, search for *metrics*.
1. Select **Metrics** to open the metrics pane and begin analysis on your cluster.

## Work in the metrics pane
In the metrics pane, select specific metrics to track, choose how to aggregate your data, and create metric charts to view on your dashboard.
The **Resource** and **Metric Namespace** pickers are pre-selected for your Azure Data Explorer cluster. The numbers in the following image correspond to the numbered list below. They guide you through different options in setting up and viewing your metrics.

1. To create a metric chart, select **Metric** name and relevant **Aggregation** per metric. For more information about different metrics, see [supported Azure Data Explorer metrics](#supported-azure-data-explorer-metrics).
1. Select **Add metric** to see multiple metrics plotted in the same chart.
1. Select **+ New chart** to see multiple charts in one view.
1. Use the time picker to change the time range (default: past 24 hours).
1. Use [**Add filter** and **Apply splitting**](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-getting-started#apply-dimension-filters-and-splitting) for metrics that have dimensions.
1. Select **Pin to dashboard** to add your chart configuration to the dashboards so that you can view it again.
1. Set **New alert rule** to visualize your metrics using the set criteria. The new alerting rule will include your target resource, metric, splitting, and filter dimensions from your chart. Modify these settings in the [alert rule creation pane](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-charts#create-alert-rules).
## Supported Azure Data Explorer metrics
The Azure Data Explorer metrics give insight into both overall performance and use of your resources, as well as information about specific actions, such as ingestion or query. The metrics in this article have been grouped by usage type. 
The types of metrics are:
* [Cluster metrics](#cluster-metrics)
* [Export metrics](#export-metrics)
* [Ingestion metrics](#ingestion-metrics)
* [Streaming ingest metrics](#streaming-ingest-metrics)
* [Query metrics](#query-metrics)
* [Materialized view metrics](#materialized-view-metrics)
For an alphabetical list of Azure Monitor's metrics for Azure Data Explorers, see [supported Azure Data Explorer cluster metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported#microsoftkustoclusters).
## Cluster metrics
The cluster metrics track the general health of the cluster. For example, resource and ingestion use and responsiveness.
|**Metric** | **Unit** | **Aggregation** | **Metric description** | **Dimensions** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cache utilization (deprecated) | Percent | Avg, Max, Min | Percentage of allocated cache resources currently in use by the cluster. Cache is the size of SSD allocated for user activity according to the defined cache policy.   An average cache utilization of 80% or less is a sustainable state for a cluster. If the average cache utilization is above 80%, the cluster should be  [scaled up](manage-cluster-vertical-scaling.md) to a storage-optimized pricing tier or  [scaled out](manage-cluster-horizontal-scaling.md) to more instances. Alternatively, adapt the cache policy to fewer days in cache. If cache utilization is over 100%, the size of data to be cached is larger than the total size of cache on the cluster.  This metric is deprecated and presented for backward compatibility only. Use the ‘Cache utilization factor’ metric instead. |  None
| Cache utilization factor | Percent | Avg, Max, Min |  Percentage of utilized disk space dedicated for hot cache in the cluster.  100% means that the disk space assigned to hot data is optimally utilized. No action is needed, and the cluster is completely fine.  Less than 100% means that the disk space assigned for hot data is not fully utilized.  More than 100% means that the cluster's disk space is not large enough to accommodate the hot data, as defined by your caching policies. To ensure that sufficient space is available for all the hot data, the amount of hot data needs to be reduced or the cluster needs to be scaled out. We recommend enabling auto scale. | None |
| CPU | Percent | Avg, Max, Min | Percentage of allocated compute resources currently in use by machines in the cluster.   An average CPU of 80% or less is sustainable for a cluster. The maximum value of CPU is 100%, which means there are no additional compute resources to process data.  When a cluster isn't performing well, check the maximum value of the CPU to determine if there are specific CPUs that are blocked. | None |
| Ingestion utilization | Percent | Avg, Max, Min | Percentage of actual resources used to ingest data from the total resources allocated, in the capacity policy, to perform ingestion. The default capacity policy is no more than 512 concurrent ingestion operations or 75% of the cluster resources invested in ingestion.   Average ingestion utilization of 80% or less is a sustainable state for a cluster. Maximum value of ingestion utilization is 100%, which means all cluster ingestion ability is used and an ingestion queue may result. | None |
| InstanceCount | Count	| Avg |	Total instance count. |
| Keep alive | Count | Avg | Tracks the responsiveness of the cluster.   A fully responsive cluster returns value 1 and a blocked or disconnected cluster returns 0. |
| Total number of throttled commands | Count | Avg, Max, Min, Sum | The number of throttled (rejected) commands in the cluster, since the maximum allowed number of concurrent (parallel) commands was reached. | None |
| Total number of extents | Count | Avg, Max, Min, Sum | Total number of data extents in the cluster.   Changes in this metric can imply massive data structure changes and high load on the cluster, since merging data extents is a CPU-heavy activity. | None |
| Follower latency | Milliseconds | Avg, Max, Min | The follower databases synchronize changes in the leader databases. Because of the synchronization, there’s a data lag of a few seconds to a few minutes in data availability.   This metric measures the length of the time lag. The time lag depends on several factors like: the overall size and rate of the ingested data to the leader, the number of databases followed, the rate of internal operations performed on the leader (merge/rebuild operations).   This is a cluster level metrics: the followers catch metadata of all databases that are followed. This metric represents the latency of the process. | None |
## Export metrics
Export metrics track the general health and performance of export operations like lateness, results, number of records, and utilization.
