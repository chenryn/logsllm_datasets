I recently used Homebrew to install PyQt (along with Qt and SIP). However, I encounter an import error whenever I try to import PyQt4 in Python 3, which was also installed using Homebrew. Interestingly, I can successfully import PyQt4 in Python 2 via the terminal.

I am new to working with Python packages and am quite confused about this situation. Could you provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue? Specifically, I would like to know how to uninstall and reinstall the necessary packages so that I can access PyQt4 through my `/usr/local/python3` installation.

Thank you in advance for your help!

To resolve the issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Uninstall the existing PyQt4 package**:
   ```sh
   brew uninstall pyqt
   ```

2. **Reinstall PyQt4 with Python 3 support**:
   ```sh
   brew reinstall pyqt --with-python3
   ```

This command will ensure that PyQt4 is installed and linked correctly with your Python 3 environment. If you still encounter issues, you may need to check the Python 3 path and ensure it is correctly set up. You can do this by running:
```sh
which python3
```
This should return the path to your Python 3 executable. If it does not point to `/usr/local/bin/python3`, you may need to adjust your `PATH` environment variable or use a virtual environment to manage your Python packages more effectively.

If you have any further questions or run into additional issues, feel free to ask!
