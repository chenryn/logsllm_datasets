User: I recently used homebrew to install pyqt (along with qt & sip), but get an import error whenever I try to import PyQt4 in Python 3 (which was also installed using homebrew). To confuse matters more, I am able to import PyQt4 on Python 2 via the terminal.
I'm totally new to working with Python packages and, with that, totally confused. Any thoughts on how I might be able to undo what I did and reinstall so that I can access PyQt via the usr/local/python3 installation?
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: brew reinstall pyqt --with-python3 will get you sorted!
