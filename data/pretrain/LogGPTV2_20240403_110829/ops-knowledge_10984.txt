User: I'm in the process of learning how a large (356-file), convoluted Python program is set up.  Besides manually reading through and parsing the code, are there any good methods for following program flow?
There are two methods which I think would be useful:

Something similar to Bash's "set -x"
Something that displays which file outputs each line of output

Are there any methods to do the above, or any other ways that you have found useful?
Assistant: You could look for a cross reference program.  There is an old program called pyxr that does this.  The aim of cross reference is to let you know how classes refer to each other.  Some of the IDE's also do this sort of thing.
