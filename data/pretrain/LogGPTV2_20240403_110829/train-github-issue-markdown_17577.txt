When attempting to run the `make` command for Julia, I encountered the following error:

```
make[1]: *** [openspecfun/Makefile] Error 129
make: *** [julia-deps] Error 2
```

However, by navigating to the `deps/openspecfun` directory and running `make` there, the process completed successfully. Afterward, I was able to resume the `make` process for Julia without further issues.

Here are the system details:

- **Operating System:**
  - `uname -a`: 
    ```
    Linux giada.mitre.org 2.6.32-431.29.2.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Sun Jul 27 15:55:46 EDT 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    ```
  - `cat /etc/redhat-release`:
    ```
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.7 (Santiago)
    ```

- **Compiler and Tools:**
  - `gcc --version`:
    ```
    gcc (GCC) 4.8.2
    ```
  - `git --version`:
    ```
    git version 2.5.0
    ```
  - Note: The default versions of `gcc` and `git` on this system are older.

The detailed error message is as follows:

```

```

This indicates that the `cdefs-compat.h` header file was missing, which caused the compilation to fail. Running `make` in the `deps/openspecfun` directory resolved this issue, allowing the Julia build to proceed.
