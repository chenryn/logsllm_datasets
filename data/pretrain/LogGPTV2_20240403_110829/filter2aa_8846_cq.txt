 Voice. As more organizations switch to VoIP, voice protocols such as SIP have become common on Ethernet
networks. This has introduced additional management, either by using dedicated voice VLANs on networks, or
establishing quality of service (QoS) levels to ensure that voice traffic has priority over non-voice traffic. Other webbased voice applications make it more difficult to manage voice as a separate entity. The consumer Skype app, for
example, allows for video and voice calls over the internet. This can cause additional bandwidth consumption that
isn’t typically planned for in the network topology design or purchased from an ISP.
 Multimedia collaboration. There are a variety of new technologies that allow instant collaboration with
colleagues. Smartboards and interactive screens make meeting in the same room more productive. Add in video
technology, and someone thousands of miles away can collaborate in the same meeting virtually. Instant
messaging through Microsoft Teams, Slack and other applications enables real-time communication. Mobile
communication has become a huge market, with mobile apps such as WhatsApp, WeChat and LINE making realtime communication possible anywhere in the world.
 Remote access. Because of the abundance of connectivity, being productive in most job roles can happen from
anywhere. Even in a more traditional environment, someone working outside of the office can use a VPN to connect
and access all the internal resources for an organization. Taking that a step further, Remote Desktop Services (RDS)
and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) can give you the same experience whether you’re in the office or at an
airport: If you have an internet connection, you can access the files and applications that you need to be productive.
A screen scraper is a security application that captures a screen (such as a server console or session) and either
records the entire session or takes a screen capture every couple of seconds. Screen scraping can help establish
exactly what a person did when they logged into a computer. Screen scrapers are most often used on servers or
remote connectivity solutions (such as VDI or Remote Desktop farms).
 Data communications. Whether you are physically in an office or working remotely, the communication between
the devices being used should be encrypted. This prevents any unauthorized device or person from openly reading
the contents of packets as they are sent across a network. Corporate networks can be segmented into multiple
VLANs to separate different resources. For example, the out-of-band management for certain devices can be on a
separate VLAN so that no other devices can communicate unless necessary. Production and development traffic
can be segmented on different VLANs. An office building with multiple departments or building floors can have
separate VLANs for each department or each floor in the building. Logical network designs can tie into physical
aspects of the building as necessary. Even with VLAN segments, the communication should be encrypted using
TLS, SSL or IPSec.
 Virtualized networks. Many organizations use hypervisors to virtualize servers and desktops for increased density
and reliability. However, to host multiple servers on a single hypervisor, the Ethernet and storage networks must
also be virtualized. VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V both use virtual network and storage switches to allow
communication between virtual machines and the physical network. The guest operating systems running in the
VMs use a synthetic network or storage adapter, which is relayed to the physical adapter on the host. The softwaredefined networking on the hypervisor can control the VLANs, port isolation, bandwidth and other aspects just as if
it was a physical port.

Answers to Domain 4 Review Questions
1. Answer: B
Explanation: In this scenario, the information indicates that the issue is with the routing of the network
communication. Routing occurs at Layer 3 of the OSI model. Layer 3 is typically handled by a router or the routing
component of a network device.
2. Answer: B
Explanation: In this scenario, collision avoidance is used. Wireless networks use collision avoidance specifically to
address the issue described in the scenario (which is known as the “hidden node problem”).
3. Answer: E
Explanation: SIP is a communications protocol used for multimedia communication such as internal voice calls. In
this scenario, you need to capture SIP traffic to ensure that you are only capturing traffic related to the phone calls.

Domain 5. Identity and Access Management
(IAM)
This section covers technologies and concepts related to authentication and authorization, for example, usernames,
passwords and directories. While it isn’t a huge domain, it is technical and there are many important details related to the
design and implementation of the technologies.
5.1 Control physical and logical access to assets
There are some common methods for controlling access without regard for the asset type. For example, we need a way to
authenticate users — validate that they are who they say they are. Then we need a way to authorize the users — figure out
whether they are authorized to perform the requested action for the specific asset (such as read or write a given file or
enter a particular server room). Let’s take a closer look at how authentication and authorization typically work.
 Authentication. Traditional authentication systems rely on a username and password, especially for
authenticating to computing devices. LDAP directories are commonly used to store user information, authenticate
users and authorize users. But there are newer systems that enhance the authentication experience. Some replace
the traditional username and password systems, while others (such as single sign-on, or SSO), extend them.
Biometrics is an emerging authentication method that includes (but is not limited to) fingerprints, retina scans,
facial recognition and iris scans.
 Authorization. Traditional authorization systems rely on security groups in a directory, such as an LDAP directory.
Based on your group memberships, you have a specific type of access (or no access). For example, administrators
might grant one security group read access to an asset, while a different security group might get
read/write/execute access to the asset. This type of system has been around a long time and is still the primary
authorization mechanism for on-premises technologies. Newer authorization systems incorporate dynamic
authorization or automated authorization. For example, the authorization process might check to see if you are in
the Sales department and in a management position before you can gain access to certain sales data. Other
information can be incorporated into authorization. For example, you can authenticate and get read access to a
web-based portal, but you can’t get into the admin area of the portal unless you are connected to the corporate
network.
Next, let’s look at some key details around controlling access to specific assets.
 Information. “Information” and “data” are interchangeable here. Information is often stored in shared folders or
in storage available via a web portal. In all cases, somebody must configure who can gain access and which actions
they can perform. The type of authentication isn’t relevant here. Authorization is what you use to control the access.
 Systems. In this context, “systems” can refer to servers or applications, either on premises or in the cloud. You
need to be familiar with the various options for controlling access. In a hybrid scenario, you can use federated
authentication and authorization in which the cloud vendor trusts your on-premises authentication and
52
authorization solutions. This centralized access control is quite common because it gives organizations complete
control no matter where the systems are.
 Devices. Devices include computers, smartphones and tablets. Today, usernames and passwords (typically from
an LDAP directory) are used to control access to most devices. Fingerprints and other biometric systems are
common, too. In high-security environments, users might have to enter a username and password and then use a
second authentication factor (such as a code from a smartcard) to gain access to a device. Beyond gaining access
to devices, you also need to account for the level of access. In high-security environments, users should not have
administrative access to devices, and only specified users should be able to gain access to particular devices.
 Facilities. Controlling access to facilities (buildings, parking garages, server rooms, etc.) is typically handled via
badge access systems. Employees carry a badge identifying them and containing a chip. Based on their department
and job role, they will be granted access to certain facilities (such as the main doors going into a building) but
denied access to other facilities (such as the power plant or the server room). For high-security facilities, such as a
data center, it is common to have multi-factor authentication. For example, you must present a valid identification
card to a security guard and also go through a hand or facial scan to gain access to the data center. Once inside,
you still need to use a key or smartcard to open racks or cages.
5.2 Manage identification and authentication of people, devices and services
This section builds on the previous section. The subtopics are more operational in nature and go into more detail.
 Identity management implementation. We looked briefly at SSO and LDAP. Now, we will look at them in more
detail.
 SSO. Single sign-on provides an enhanced user authentication experience as the user accesses multiple
systems and data across a variety of systems. It is closely related to federated identity management (which
is discussed later in this section). Instead of authenticating to each system individually, the recent sign-on
is used to create a security token that can be reused across apps and systems. Thus, a user authenticates
once and then can gain access to a variety of systems and data without having to authenticate again.
Typically, the SSO experience will last for a specified period, such as 4 hours or 8 hours. SSO often takes
advantage of the user’s authentication to their computing device. For example, a user signs into their device
in the morning, and later when they launch a web browser to go to a time-tracking portal, the portal accepts
their existing authentication. SSO can be more sophisticated. For example, a user might be able to use SSO
to seamlessly gain access to a web-based portal, but if the user attempts to make a configuration change,
the portal might prompt for authentication before allowing the change. Note that using the same username
and password to access independent systems is not SSO. Instead, it is often referred to as “same sign-on”
because you use the same credentials. The main benefit of SSO is also its main downside: It simplifies the
process of gaining access to multiple systems for everyone. For example, if attackers compromise a user’s
credentials, they can sign into the computer and then seamlessly gain access to all apps using SSO. Multifactor authentication can help mitigate this risk.
 LDAP. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a standards-based protocol (RFC 4511) that traces
its roots back to the X.500 standard that came out in the early 1990s. Many vendors have implemented
LDAP-compliant systems and LDAP-compliant directories, often with vendor-specific enhancements. LDAP
53
is especially popular for on-premises corporate networks. An LDAP directory stores information about
users, groups, computers, and sometimes other objects such as printers and shared folders. It is common
to use an LDAP directory to store user metadata, such as their name, address, phone numbers,
departments, employee number, etc. Metadata in an LDAP directory can be used for dynamic
authentication systems or other automation. The most common LDAP system today is Microsoft Active
Directory (Active Directory Domain Services or AD DS). It uses Kerberos (an authentication protocol that
offers enhanced security) for authentication, by default.
 Single- or multi-factor authentication. There are three different authentication factors — something you know,
something you have and something you are. Each factor has many different methods. Something you know could
be a username and password or the answer to a personal question; something you have could be a smartcard or
a phone, and something you are could be a fingerprint or retinal scan. Single-factor authentication requires only
one method from any of the three factors — usually a username and password. Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
requires a method from each of two or three different factors, which generally increases security. For example,
requiring you to provide a code sent to a hard token in addition to a username and password increases security
because an attacker who steals your credentials is unlikely to also have access to the hard token. Different methods
provide different levels of security, though. For example, the answer to a personal question isn’t as secure as a
token from a security app on your phone, because a malicious user is much more likely to be able to discover the
information to answer the question on the internet than to get access to your phone. One downside to multi-factor
authentication is the complexity it introduces; for instance, if a user doesn’t have their mobile phone or token
device with them, they can’t sign in. To minimize issues, you should provide options for the second method (for
example, the user can opt for a phone call to their landline).
 Accountability. In this context, accountability is the ability to track users’ actions as they access systems and data.
You need to be able to identify the users on a system, know when they access it, and record what they do while on
the system. This audit data must be captured and logged for later analysis and troubleshooting. Important
information can be found in this data. For example, if a user successfully authenticates to a computer in New York
and then successfully authenticates to a computer in London a few minutes later, that is suspicious and should be
investigated. If an account has repeated bad password attempts, you need data to track down the source of the
attempts. Today, many companies are centralizing accountability. For example, all servers and apps send their
audit data to the centralized system, so admins can gain insight across multiple systems with a single query.
Because of the enormous amount of data in these centralized systems, they are usually “big data” systems, and
