We envision several directions of future work. First, the efﬁ-
ciency of PBES can be improved by using other encryption schemes
such as the Tag-KEM/DEM framework [1]. The practicality of
PBES can be further explored by deeper integration with the power
grid and by studying other real-world applications such as distributed
ﬁle sharing. Second, new policy based encryption schemes can be
developed that support ﬂexible policies and provide policy secrecy
against all servers (PBES reveals policies to KDC). Furthermore,
providing schemes that allow routing of messages based on the se-
cret policies is an additional challenge. Third, PBES shares the key
escrow property with several other schemes that may limit its ap-
plicability for certain applications. New schemes that minimize or
eliminate this limitation while still providing desirable properties
would provide signiﬁcant advancement.

POLICY AND KEY ENCAPSULATION
MECHANISM (PKEM)
A policy and key encapsulation mechanism (PKEM) is an encapsula-
tion mechanism, which we deﬁne to encapsulate both a key and a pol-
icy. Similar to a KEM a PKEM consists of three algorithms, namely,
PKEM.KeyGen, PKEM.Encrypt and PKEM.Decrypt except that unlike
KEM, PKEM.Encrypt also accepts an additional bit string from the mes-
sage space (interpreted as policy) as input and PKEM.Decrypt outputs both
the key and policy as seen in Section 5.2.
Given that a PKEM encapsulates both a key and policy we deﬁne two
notions of indistinguishability for a PKEM against an adaptive chosen ci-
phertext attack, viz, key indistinguishability and policy indistinguishability.
We deﬁne each of them as follows.
Deﬁnition A.1. Key Indistinguishability. Let A = (A1,A2) be a PPT
CCA2 adversary. We deﬁne the guessing advantage of A as follows:
h
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Pr
Gpkem−key−ind−cca2
PKEM,A
(k) = b
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Advpkem−key−ind−cca2
PKEM, A
(k) =
where
(k) :
PKEM,A
Game Gpkem−key−ind−cca2
(sk, pk) $←− PKEM.KeyGen(1k); (St, pol) $←− ADEC(.)
b $←− {0,1}; K∗
0
(K∗

1 ,C∗) $←− PKEM.Encrypt(pk, pol); K∗ $←− K∗
$←− ADEC(.)
(pk,C∗,K∗,St); Return b0
$←− {0,1}PKEM.KeyLen(k)
1
b
2
(pk)
and oracle DEC(.) is deﬁned as PKEM.Decrypt(sk, .) with the condition
that the oracle rejects queries on C∗ after the target ciphertext is given to
the adversary.
Deﬁnition A.2. Policy Indistinguishability. Let A = (A1,A2) be a PPT
CCA2 adversary. We deﬁne the guessing advantage of A as follows:
h
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Pr
Gpkem−pol−ind−cca2
PKEM,A
(k) = b
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(k) =
where
(k) :

Game Gpkem−pol−ind−cca2
(sk, pk) $←− PKEM.KeyGen(1k); (St, pol0, pol1) $←− ADEC(.)
b $←− {0,1}; (K∗,C∗) $←− PKEM.Encrypt(pk, polb)
b0
(pk,(K∗,C∗),St); Return b0
$←− ADEC(.)
1
2
(pk)
and oracle DEC(.) is deﬁned as PKEM.Decrypt(sk, .) with the condition
that the oracle rejects queries on C∗ after the target ciphertext is given to
the adversary.
A symmetric-key based PKEM (SPKEM) is similar to the public-key
based PKEM described above except that a symmetric key is used instead of
the asymmetric key-pair. Notions of key and policy indistinguishability for
SPKEM are deﬁned similarly to that of PKEM except that they are deﬁned
for an OTCCA adversary, i.e., the adversary doesn’t get access to encryp-
tion oracle in the ﬁrst phase. We can construct a SPKEM using a DEM and
then build a PKEM using SPKEM and KEM as shown in Section 5.2. The
SPKEM scheme of Section 5.2 is secure against OTCCA attacks on key and
policy indistinguishability as stated by the following theorems.
Theorem A.1. If DEM is secure against one-time adaptive chosen cipher-
text attacks (OTCCA) on (message) indistinguishability then SPKEM is se-
cure against one-time adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (OTCCA) on key
indistinguishability.
In particular, for every PPT adversary A, there exists a PPT adversary B
whose running time is essentially the same as that of A such that for all
k ∈ N, we have
Advspkem−key−ind−otcca
SPKEM, A
(k) = Advdem−ind−otcca
DEM,B

Theorem A.2. If DEM is secure against one-time adaptive chosen cipher-
text attacks (OTCCA) on (message) indistinguishability then SPKEM is se-
cure against one-time adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (OTCCA) on pol-
icy indistinguishability.
In particular, for every PPT adversary A, there exists a PPT adversary B
whose running time is essentially the same as that of A such that for all
k ∈ N, we have
