User: I have Python 3.2.2 downloaded and have been using IDLE to execute code; however, I was wondering whether it is possible to have Python 3.2.2 run through Terminal as opposed to Python 2.6.1 on which it is currently running. 
How would I got about doing so? Would there be any bad side effects?
Assistant: Sure, start the terminal and type python3.2. That should get you into a Python 3.2 shell.
