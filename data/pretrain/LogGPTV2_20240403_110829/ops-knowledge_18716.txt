User: I know there's a lot of questions asking about the opposite, but is there a particularly good way to launch a Python script from an executable? The executable itself was originally written in Python and compiled using py2exe so I was thinking of using popen() and passing python myscript.py but not sure if that's the most efficient.
The particular script being launched would be Python 2.7 with the Python ArcGIS interpreter.
Assistant: If you're simply trying to execute a python script externally, then just use popen() on your script, as you said.
