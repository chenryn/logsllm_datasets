# Add the PowerToys Run Shortcut to the PowerToys 'Shortcut Guide' Display

Currently, when the Shortcut Guide is displayed on the screen, it does not show the [Space] key shortcut that launches the PowerToys Run dialog. We should include this shortcut in the Shortcut Guide to ensure that all relevant shortcuts are visible and easily accessible to users.
