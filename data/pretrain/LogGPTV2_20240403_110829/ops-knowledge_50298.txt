Assistant: 1. Create a snapshot: In the virtualization management platform, select the virtual machine to create a snapshot, right-click, and select "Snapshot Management" or "Create Snapshot". Next, you can fill in the name and description of the snapshot, choose whether to include the memory state of the virtual machine and whether the snapshot can be overwritten. Click the "Create Snapshot" button to complete the snapshot operation. 2. Snapshot recovery: In the virtualization management platform, select the virtual machine whose snapshot is to be restored, find the snapshot to be restored in "Snapshot Management", right-click and select "Restore". Next, you can choose whether to restore the current state of the virtual machine to the state at the time of snapshot creation. Click the "Restore" button to complete the snapshot restore operation. 3. Snapshot deletion: In the virtualization management platform, select the virtual machine whose snapshot is to be deleted, find the snapshot to be deleted in "Snapshot Management", right-click and select "Delete". Next, you can choose whether you want to merge the snapshot into the virtual machine disk. Click the "Delete" button to complete the snapshot deletion operation. It should be noted that in a virtualized environment, snapshots occupy disk space, so snapshots need to be managed according to actual conditions to avoid excessive disk space occupation.
