ABSTRACT 
Third-party tracking has proliferated across the whole Internet in 
recent  years.  To  protect  Web  users,  much  effort  has  been  spent 
and almost all of them merely choose to stop third-party service to 
prevent tracking. However, users should be in total charge of their 
personal information and it does not mean that every user would 
like  to  give  up  personalization  service  to  protect  privacy  in  any 
case. In this poster, we present a new approach to make a balance 
between  privacy  and  personalization  through  recommendation 
system, which can help users judge the level of privacy threat so 
that  users  can  choose  between  privacy  and  personalization  in  a 
reasonable way.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Third-party tracking has proliferated across the whole Internet 
in  recent  years.  A  few  third-party  websites  (like  advertising 
companies)  track  users  to  provide  personalization  service  at  the 
cost  of  privacy  violation,  while  Web  users  want  to  control  over 
Web  tracking  [1].  To  protect  Web  users,  much  effort  has  been 
spent  and  almost  all  of  them  merely  choose  to  stop  third-party 
service  and  prevent  third-party  websites  from  tracking  users. 
Comparatively, we present a new approach to mitigate third-party 
tracking problem and try to make a balance between privacy and 
personalization. 
Related  work:  Existing  technical  countermeasures,  such  as 
opt-out  cookie,  DNT  (Do  Not  Track)  header,  no  cookie  or  JS, 
referrer filtering and blocking [2], mostly stop tracking as well as 
service provided by third-party websites. And none of the existing 
methods could offer adequate protection alone and many of them 
are  difficult  for  users  to  understand  or  configure  [3].  Compared 
with these efforts, several research projects take a different tack 
(Privad [4], Reznichenko[5], Adnostic [6], and RePriv[7]). Instead 
of  simply  opting  out  of  tracking,  they  put  forward  alternative 
advertising  technologies  that  allow  for  behavioral  targeting

without requiring tracking. However, these works focus on only 
one type of tracking (advertising tracking) and ignore other types.  
Balance between Privacy and Personalization: Users should 
be in total charge of what he or she owns, and it does not mean 
that  every  user  would  like  to  give  up  personalization  service  to 
protect  privacy  in  any  case.  For  example,  when  a  user  visits  a 
shopping  website,  he  may  permit  ad  tracking  for  precise 
advertisement  recommendation.  While  when  the  user  visits  a 
website about health, he may not want to be tracked by any types 
trackers.  As  a  consequence,  we  try  to  balance  privacy  with 
personalization using the relationship between the types of first-
party website and third-party website. 
Contributions:  In  this  paper,  we  present  a  new  approach  to 
make  a  balance  between  privacy  and  personalization  through 
recommendation  system,  TrackWatcher.  Our  paper  makes  the 
following contributions: 
(1)  We  design  an  algorithm  automatically  discriminating 
between  first-party  websites  and  third-party  websites  in  a  web 
page, and calculating their types respectively. 
(2)  We  implement  our  classifying  algorithm  and  crawl  on 
Alexa 
top  100,000  websites  gathering  different  domain 
information  in  each  website  and  outputting  their  corresponding 
types. 
(3)  We  introduce  recommendation  system  into  third-party 
website  management  and  build  a  recommendation  model 
providing users with rating measures on HTTP requests to third-
party websites. 
2.  FRAMEWORK DESIGN 
2.1  Overview 
TrackWatcher is composed of four parts deployed separately in 
server-side  and  client-side:  web  crawler  and  data  preprocessing 
module  (server-side),  websites  classifying  module  (server-side), 
recommendation server (server-side), and HTTP requests monitor 
and manager (client-side). 
Figure  1  illustrates  the  mechanism  of  TrackWatcher  Client. 
First, the user needs to finish his/her personal preference settings 
for  the  TrackWatcher.  Then,  when  the  user  visits  a  website, 
TrackWatcher  Client  will  get  the  first  party  website  (FPW) 
HTML  file  from  the  FPW  server.  Meanwhile,  TrackWatcher 
Client checks the LocalData to find out whether there is historical 
recommended  list  for  third  party  websites  (TPW)  embedded  in 
this FPW. If so, this historical recommended list will be used as 
recommendation result. If not, TrackWatcher Client will send the 
URL  to  TrackWatcher  Server  to  get  the  recommended  list  of 
TPWs embedded within this FPW. Next, TrackWatcher will parse 
the HTML file and apply the recommendation result. After this, 
1472 
each time a third party website server sends a HTTP request to the 
first party website, TrackWatcher will determine whether  or  not 
to  block  the  TPW  based  on  the  recommendation  result.  Finally, 
TrackWatcher displays the web page. 
2)Level 2: social network, blog, and email 
3)Level 3: others 
Level  1  websites  need  the  most  protection,  while  Level  3 
websites need the least protection.  
Finally, 
Recommendation 
Server  Module 
finished 
recommended  list  for  each  user  based  on  his/her  personal 
preference  settings  and  the  type  information  of  FPW  and  TPW. 
We introduce our recommendation algorithm in detail in the next 
section. 
Figure 1. TrackWatcher client framework  
The process of determining recommended lists is completed in 
the  server-side  of  TrackWatcher  (shown  in  Figure  2).  First, 
TrackWatcher  Server  used  a  Web  crawler  to  get  the  raw  type 
information  of  Alexa  Top  100,000  websites  as  well  as  their 
corresponding  third-party  websites.  This  raw  type  information 
included Meta Keyword, Meta Description, Title, and Wikipedia 
information. Second, this raw type information was passed to the 
Pre-Processing  Module 
the  Automatic 
Classification  Module.  Third,  the  Classification  Module  utilized 
machine  learning  algorithms  to  generate  the  category  of  each 
FPW  and  each  TPW.  We  also  group  these  categories  into 
different  levels.  For  third  party  website  categories,  we  classify 
TPW  categories  into  three  different  levels  based  on  their  credit 
and privacy security levels, as follows:  
to  process 
for 
1) Level 1: Hosting Platform, Content Provider  
2) Level 2: Advertising Company, Analytics Services, Fronted 
Services  
3) Level 3: Social Network, E-Commerce  
Level  1  websites  were  treated  as  the  safest,  while  Level  3 
websites were treated as the most harmful. For first party website 
categories, we classify FPW categories into three different levels:  
1)Level 1: banking, online shopping, online payment 
2.2  Recommendation Server Module  
The  recommendation  database  of  TrackWatcher  contains  five 
tables as shown in Figure 2:  
1) FPWInfo: the type information of first party website 
2) TPWInfo: the type information of third-party websites 
3) UserPref: the personal privacy level settings 
4) FTInfo: the FPW-TPW pair matching 
5) RatingInfo: stores user’s historical FPW-TPW blocking data 
(Score 1: Permit, Score 0: Block) 
To  gain  better  recommendation  performance,  we  introduce  a 
hybrid recommender model combining collaborative filtering and 
utility-based  filtering  techniques  in  our  approach  for  privacy 
protection. 
Collaborative  filtering:  Collaborative  filtering  has  been 
widely  used  and  is  probably  the  most  mature  recommendation 
technique. In our work, collaborative filtering technique was used 
to  aggregate  the  rating  data  of  Web  users  upon  each  first  party 
website and third-party tracker pair (A, B).  Here,  A  stands  for  a 
first-party  website  and  B  refers  to  a  third-party  tracker.  For 
“permit” case, rating is equal to 1; and for “block” case, rating is 
equal to 0. Then collaborative filtering technique was used again 
to  recognize  the  commonalities  between  different  Web  users 
based on these rating data using Formula (1):
