## Abstract
Third-party tracking has become pervasive across the internet in recent years. To protect web users, many efforts have been made, and most of these solutions involve simply blocking third-party services to prevent tracking. However, users should have full control over their personal information and not every user is willing to sacrifice personalization for privacy. In this poster, we present a novel approach that balances privacy and personalization through a recommendation system. This system helps users assess the level of privacy threat, allowing them to make informed decisions about whether to allow or block third-party tracking.

## 1. Introduction
Third-party tracking has proliferated across the internet in recent years. A few third-party websites, such as advertising companies, track users to provide personalized services, often at the cost of privacy violations. Web users, however, want to have control over web tracking [1]. To protect users, many efforts have been made, and most of them involve stopping third-party services and preventing tracking. In contrast, we propose a new approach to mitigate third-party tracking while balancing privacy and personalization.

### Related Work
Existing technical countermeasures, such as opt-out cookies, DNT (Do Not Track) headers, no cookies or JavaScript, referrer filtering, and blocking [2], typically stop tracking but also disable the services provided by third-party websites. None of these methods offer adequate protection on their own, and many are difficult for users to understand or configure [3]. Some research projects, like Privad [4], Reznichenko [5], Adnostic [6], and RePriv [7], take a different approach. Instead of simply opting out of tracking, they propose alternative advertising technologies that allow for behavioral targeting without requiring tracking. However, these works focus only on advertising tracking and ignore other types of tracking.

### Balancing Privacy and Personalization
Users should have full control over their personal information, and not every user is willing to give up personalization for privacy. For example, a user might allow ad tracking on a shopping website for precise advertisement recommendations but may not want to be tracked when visiting a health-related website. Therefore, we aim to balance privacy and personalization by considering the relationship between the types of first-party and third-party websites.

### Contributions
In this paper, we introduce a new approach to balance privacy and personalization using a recommendation system called TrackWatcher. Our contributions include:

1. **Algorithm Design:** We design an algorithm to automatically distinguish between first-party and third-party websites on a web page and categorize them.
2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** We implement our classification algorithm and crawl the top 100,000 websites on Alexa, gathering domain information and categorizing them.
3. **Recommendation System:** We introduce a recommendation system to manage third-party websites, providing users with rating measures for HTTP requests to third-party websites.

## 2. Framework Design

### 2.1 Overview
TrackWatcher consists of four main components: a web crawler and data preprocessing module (server-side), a website classification module (server-side), a recommendation server (server-side), and an HTTP request monitor and manager (client-side).

**Figure 1.** illustrates the mechanism of the TrackWatcher Client. The process begins with the user setting their personal preferences. When the user visits a website, the TrackWatcher Client retrieves the HTML file from the first-party website (FPW) server. It then checks the local data for a historical recommended list of third-party websites (TPWs) embedded in the FPW. If a list exists, it is used; otherwise, the client sends the URL to the TrackWatcher Server to get the recommended list. The client then parses the HTML file and applies the recommendation. Each time a TPW sends an HTTP request to the FPW, TrackWatcher decides whether to block the TPW based on the recommendation. Finally, the web page is displayed.

### 2.2 Recommendation Server Module
The recommendation database of TrackWatcher includes five tables:

1. **FPWInfo:** Type information of first-party websites.
2. **TPWInfo:** Type information of third-party websites.
3. **UserPref:** Personal privacy level settings.
4. **FTInfo:** Pair matching of FPW-TPW.
5. **RatingInfo:** Stores historical FPW-TPW blocking data (Score 1: Permit, Score 0: Block).

To enhance recommendation performance, we use a hybrid recommender model combining collaborative filtering and utility-based filtering techniques.

#### Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is widely used and is a mature recommendation technique. In our work, it aggregates rating data from web users for each first-party website and third-party tracker pair (A, B). Here, A represents a first-party website, and B represents a third-party tracker. For "permit" cases, the rating is 1; for "block" cases, the rating is 0. The collaborative filtering technique is then used to recognize commonalities between different web users based on these ratings using Formula (1):

\[ \text{corr}(u, v) = \frac{\sum_{i \in T} (r_{ui} - \bar{r}_u) (r_{vi} - \bar{r}_v)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i \in T} (r_{ui} - \bar{r}_u)^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i \in T} (r_{vi} - \bar{r}_v)^2}} \]

Where:
- \( r_{ui} \) is the rating of user \( u \) for item \( i \).
- \( \bar{r}_u \) is the average rating of user \( u \).
- \( T \) is the set of items rated by both users \( u \) and \( v \).

This approach ensures that the recommendation system provides accurate and personalized suggestions, helping users make informed decisions about their privacy and personalization preferences.
