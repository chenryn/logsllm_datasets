Abstract. We challenge a set of assumptions that are frequently used
to model interdomain routing in the Internet by confronting them with
routing decisions that are actually taken by ASes, as revealed through
publicly available BGP feeds. Our results quantify for the ﬁrst time the
extent to which such assumptions are too simple to model real-world
Internet routing policies. This should introduce a note of caution into
future work that makes these assumptions and should prompt attempts
to ﬁnd more accurate models.

Introduction
Figure 1a illustrates a case of what is called multi-exit routing in the Inter-
net. From BGPmon’s [1] publicly-available feed of the BGP interdomain route
updates of numerous routers, we know that the autonomous system (AS) in
the middle of the ﬁgure, AS6762, has two diﬀerent routes by which to reach
the address preﬁx 103.11.245.0/24, the advertisement for which is originated
by AS5845, on the ﬁgure’s far right. One route, on top, goes via AS10026 and
AS45932, while the other, on the bottom, goes via AS1299. Which of these routes
will AS6762 advertise to the ASes that neighbor it on the left, AS262589 and
AS26615?
The AS in the middle is Telecom Italia’s Sparkle, the world’s 9th most im-
portant AS as reported by CAIDA’s AS Rank service [2]. The top route goes via
Pacnet, which is a customer of Sparkle according to CAIDA’s AS Relationships
database [3]. The bottom route is via TeliaNet, which the database tells us is
Sparkle’s peer. The standard assumption is that an AS will always route through
a paying customer rather than a peer, from which it receives no revenue. And
indeed Sparkle advertises the route via its paying customer Pacnet to the top-
left neighbor, INTERNEXA. However, the BGP feeds also tell us that Sparkle
advertises a diﬀerent route, the one via its peer TeliaNet, to the bottom-left
neighbor, Tim Cellular. It appears that the assumption does not hold.
What is wrong? Could there be an error in the AS Relationships database
that we are relying upon? Suppose, for instance, that TeliaNet was in fact a

paying customer of Sparkle, rather than its peer. Then, Sparkle’s routing through
both Pacnet and TeliaNet would be perfectly coherent with the assumption that
Sparkle will prefer to route through its customers.
However, this scenario would violate another common assumption: that an AS
with two customers will route through the one that oﬀers a shorter sequence of
AS hops to the destination preﬁx. Since the route via TeliaNet is just two hops,
it should be chosen instead of the route via Pacnet, which takes three hops, but
this is not the case. If Sparkle were to override this choice, which BGP practices
allow, it would be to select Pacnet in place of TeliaNet, and not advertise routes
via both of them, as it does.
The scientiﬁc community already knows that network operators do not al-
ways implement interdomain routing policies in ways that are consistent with
the simplifying assumptions that are made for modeling purposes. However, the
degree to which reality deﬁes the assumptions has not previously been quantiﬁed.
This paper looks at 4 million routes that we collected from IPv4 BGP feeds, and
in particular at 204 thousand instances of multi-exit routing that those feeds
reveal. In 33% of the multi-exit cases, the assumption about routing preferen-
tially to customers over peers and to peers over providers is not coherent with
the relationships that are described by CAIDA. In fully 57% of the cases, the
path length assumption does not hold.
This paper proceeds in Sect. 2 by providing some background for readers
who are not familiar with the details of BGP. In this context, we formalize four
commonly-held assumptions, and cite examples in the literature where they are
made. (The assumptions described above are composites of these four assump-
tions.) Sect. 3 describes our methodology for confronting the assumptions with
the data. Results appear in Sect. 4. The paper wraps up with related work
(Sect. 5) and a conclusion pointing to future work (Sect. 6).
Our contributions are to formalize commonly-held assumptions about inter-
domain routing and AS relationships and propose two methods to identify vio-
lations of the models. Also, we provide the ﬁrst quantiﬁcation of such violations
to be based upon publicly-available data.

Interdomain Routing and Our Set of Assumptions
2.1 BGP Background
BGP is the interdomain routing protocol that allows an AS to learn how to route
to destinations in other ASes. A BGP route describes the AS Path, or sequence
of ASes, to be traversed on the way to a preﬁx, which is a set of contiguous IP
addresses. The BGP next hop is the egress point to use at the IP level in order to
follow the route. Routes are exchanged between routers in the same AS through
iBGP sessions, and between routers in diﬀerent ASes via eBGP.
In the general case, a BGP router learns several routes toward a given desti-
nation. It is free to accept just some of them and to modify these. The router
then elects one route (the best route) by following the selection steps of the BGP
decision process [4], typically modeled as in Table 1. At each step, routes domi-
nated by at least one other route are discarded. When, after one of these steps,
there remains just one element in the set, this element is the best route.

1. Highest local preference
2. Shortest AS Path length
3. Lowest origin type
4. Lowest multi-exit discriminator
5. eBGP over iBGP
6. Lowest IGP cost
7. Tie break rules
The router is free to modify a best route before forwarding it to its neighboring
routers and it is free to select which of those routers will receive the route.
preference. If a router receives two routes  and (cid:3)
with a higher value of local_pref assigned to , then  is preferred to (cid:3)
One modiﬁable parameter that aﬀects the choice of best routes is the local
toward the same destination
.
2.2 AS Relationships
ASes use BGP to implement their contractual commercial agreements, which
are typically modeled by three types of economic relationship.
– Customer-to-provider (c2p): a customer pays a provider for transit service
to the rest of the Internet for its traﬃc and its customers’ traﬃc.
– Peering (peer): a pair of ASes transit traﬃc between them or their customers
to destinations belonging to them or their customers, free of charge.
– Sibling-to-sibling (s2s): a pair of ASes transit traﬃc for each other and for
their respective clients to every destination in the Internet, free of charge.
Gao [5] proposed a way to infer AS relationships based upon observed BGP
routes, opening the way to much subsequent work.

2.3 A Set of Interdomain Routing Assumptions
This section describes four common assumptions about interdomain routing,
citing selected papers that make each assumption.
(A1) iBGP valid
The assumption is that any BGP route has the potential to be propagated
within an AS to all routers of that AS. In other words, route propagation is only
governed by routing decisions taken by the diﬀerent routers in the AS and there
are no parts of the AS to which a route cannot be forwarded.
This assumption seems justiﬁed since an AS should guarantee this property
in order to assure that all of its routers are selecting the best routes [6–10].
(A2) Policy through eBGP only
Routing policy is only applied by routers through their participation in interdo-
main (i.e., eBGP) sessions. This assumption implies that the local_pref value
is not modiﬁed by routers through their iBGP sessions. If a router were to mod-
ify the local_pref value for some or all of the routes in an iBGP session, this
could aﬀect the choices of all routers in the AS to which this route is forwarded.1
This assumption is made to simplify the model of route propagation in an
AS [6, 8–10].
(A3) Customer over peer, peer over provider
The assumption that an AS always prefers to send traﬃc through a customer
over a peer and through a peer over a provider so as to maximize the presumed
economic beneﬁts. Sending traﬃc through a customer means that the customer
will pay for it, while sending though a provider means that one has to pay the
provider. [6, 8, 10].
An AS will implement this hierarchy by assigning a higher local_pref value
to routes learned from a customer than to routes learned from a provider.
(A4) Only one relationship type
In the literature, each AS interconnection is typically modeled as a single eco-
nomic relationship [5,8–16]. This assumption rules out, for instance, an AS being
the peer of another AS in one part of the world, while being that AS’s customer
in another location. This is a convenient assumption to make because the main
source of data consists of AS paths conveyed on BGP routes. These paths pro-
vide only AS-level information, and do not reveal, for instance, in cases where
there are several possible egress points through which traﬃc can pass from one
AS to another, which ones are used.
3 Methodology
If we had detailed knowledge of the routing decisions made by BGP routers,
it would be possible to challenge, and possibly invalidate, the individual as-
sumptions described in the previous section. Unfortunately, this information is
1 There is a way to inﬂuence a routing decision before the local preference step, which
is to use a vendor-speciﬁc weight attribute. It allows a router to prefer routes based
upon which router it received them from. For the purposes of (A2), modifying weights
through iBGP sessions has the same violation impact as modifying local preferences.

unavailable to us. However, the publicly-available BGP feeds do allow us to
challenge combinations of assumptions.
The novelty of our approach lies in the way that we use observed instances
of multi-exit routing as a means to identify assumption violations. An instance,
which we call a multi-exit, arises when an AS uses multiple next-hop ASes to
reach a given destination preﬁx. Brieﬂy, we process the feeds to identify multi-
exits (Sect. 3.1), and then we examine each one for incoherencies in either the AS
path length, the AS relationships, or both (Sect. 3.2). Each incoherency reveals
a case in which one or more common assumptions have been violated.
3.1 Observing Multi-exits
Not all multi-exits can be observed through BGP feeds, but we can see them
when an AS advertises two or more routes to a common destination preﬁx to
its neighboring ASes. Fig. 1b illustrates the general case: an AS X announces
to its neighbors W and W (cid:3)
diﬀerent routes to a destination preﬁx p, each route
having a diﬀerent next-hop AS, Y or Y (cid:3)
.
We observe multi-exits as follows. A BGP snapshot at a given instant t is the
set of all of the BGP routes being used by the vantage points at that time. The
AS Path of a route is a sequence of AS numbers (AS 1, . . ., ASi, . . ., ASk). For
each AS ASi of the AS Path and for each destination preﬁx p related to this path,
we extract the next-hop AS ASi+1 used by ASi to reach the destination p. In
this way we build the set of BGP triplets, TBGP = {(ASi, ASi+1, p)}. Looking at
these triplets, a multi-exit is observed whenever we detect two (or more) triplets
of the form (ASi, ASi+1, p) and (ASi, AS(cid:3)
i+1, p).
3.2 Observing Incoherencies in Multi-exits
We now present simple criteria for detecting, in a multi-exit, two types of inco-
herency with a set of common assumptions. Each incoherency reveals an instance
in which one or more assumptions have been violated. Note that while observed
incoherencies allow us to reveal assumption violations, the inverse is not nec-
essarily the case. If an assumption is violated by an AS for which there is no
multi-exit in our database, our techniques will not reveal this violation. Further-
more, it is possible, even in a multi-exit, for a violation to not manifest itself
as an observable incoherency. Hence, our results provide a lower bound on the
number of actual violations present at the time of the BGP snapshot.
Incoherent AS Path Lengths. We observe incoherent AS Path lengths as
follows. Assume that X, in Fig. 1b, through a router R (not shown), announces
to its neighbor W a route  that it has received from Y , and simultaneously,
through another router R(cid:3)
a route
(cid:3)
. If any of the ﬁrst four steps of the BGP decision
process (see Table 1) had been decisive, assumptions (A1) and (A2) require that

will have selected the same route. Since each has selected a diﬀerent

Our ﬁrst criterion is thus to check the AS path length of routes identiﬁed in a
multi-exit. If an AS announces two routes  and (cid:3)
toward the same destination,
