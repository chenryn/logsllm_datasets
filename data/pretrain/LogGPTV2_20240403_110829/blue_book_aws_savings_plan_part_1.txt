[Saving
plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/what-is-savings-plans.html)
offer a flexible pricing model that provides savings on AWS usage.
You can save up to 72 percent on your AWS compute workloads.
!!! note "Please don't make Jeff Bezos even richer, try to pay as less money to
AWS as you can."
!!! warning "When doing the savings plan reservations always use the reservation rates instead of the on-demand rates!"
Savings Plans provide savings beyond On-Demand rates in exchange for
a commitment of using a specified amount of compute power (measured per hour)
for a one or three year period.
When you sign up for Savings Plans, the prices you'll pay for usage stays the
same through the plan term. You can pay for your commitment using All Upfront,
Partial upfront, or No upfront payment options.
Plan types:
* *Compute Savings Plans* provide the most flexibility and prices that are up
    to 66 percent off of On-Demand rates. These plans automatically apply to
    your EC2 instance usage, regardless of instance family (for example, m5, c5,
    etc.), instance sizes (for example, c5.large, c5.xlarge, etc.), Region (for
    example, us-east-1, us-east-2, etc.), operating system (for example,
    Windows, Linux, etc.), or tenancy (for example, Dedicated, default,
    Dedicated Host). With Compute Savings Plans, you can move a workload from C5
    to M5, shift your usage from EU (Ireland) to EU (London). You can continue
    to benefit from the low prices provided by Compute Savings Plans as you make
    these changes.
* *EC2 Instance Savings Plans* provide savings up to 72 percent off On-Demand,
    in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family in a chosen AWS
    Region (for example, M5 in Virginia). These plans automatically apply to
    usage regardless of size (for example, m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge, etc.), OS (for
    example, Windows, Linux, etc.), and tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)
    within the specified family in a Region.
    With an EC2 Instance Savings Plan, you can change your instance size within
    the instance family (for example, from c5.xlarge to c5.2xlarge) or the
    operating system (for example, from Windows to Linux), or move from
    Dedicated tenancy to Default and continue to receive the discounted rate
    provided by your EC2 Instance Savings Plan.
* *Standard Reserved Instances*: The old reservation system, you reserve an
    instance type and you can get up to 72 percent of discount. The lack of
    flexibility makes them inferior to the new EC2 instance plans.
* *Convertible Reserved Instances*: Same as the Standard Reserved Instances but
    with more flexibility. Discounts range up to 66%, similar to the new Compute
    Savings Plan, which again gives more less the same discounts with more
    flexibility, so I wouldn't use this plan either.
# [Understanding how Savings Plans apply to your AWS usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/sp-applying.html)
If you have active Savings Plans, they apply automatically to your eligible AWS
usage to reduce your bill.
Savings Plans apply to your usage after the Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RI)
are applied. Then *EC2 Instance Savings Plans* are applied before *Compute
Savings Plans* because *Compute Savings Plans* have broader applicability.
They calculate your potential savings percentages of each combination of
eligible usage. This percentage compares the Savings Plans rates with your
current On-Demand rates. Your Savings Plans are applied to your highest savings
percentage first. If there are multiple usages with equal savings percentages,
Savings Plans are applied to the first usage with the lowest Savings Plans rate.
Savings Plans continue to apply until there are no more remaining usages, or
your commitment is exhausted. Any remaining usage is charged at the On-Demand
rates.
## Savings plan example
In this example, you have the following usage in a single hour:
* 4x r5.4xlarge Linux, shared tenancy instances in us-east-1, running for the
    duration of a full hour.
* 1x m5.24xlarge Linux, dedicated tenancy instance in us-east-1, running for the
    duration of a full hour.
Pricing example:
| Type        | On-Demand rate | Compute Savings Plans rate | CSP Savings percentage | EC2 Instance Savings Plans rate | EC2IS percentage |
| ---         | ---            | ---                        | ---                    | ---                             | ---              |
| r5.4xlarge  | $1.00          | $0.70                      | 30%                    | $0.60                           | 40%              |
| m5.24xlarge | $10.00         | $8.20                      | 18%                    | $7.80                           | 22%              |
They've included other products in the example but I've removed them for the
sake of simplicity
### Scenario 1: Savings Plan apply to all usage
You purchase a one-year, partial upfront Compute Savings Plan with a $50.00/hour
commitment.
Your Savings Plan covers all of your usage because multiplying each of your
usages by the equivalent Compute Savings Plans is $47.13. This is still less
than the $50.00/hour commitment.
Without Savings Plans, you would be charged at On-Demand rates in the amount of
$59.10.
### Scenario 2: Savings Plans apply to some usage
You purchase a one-year, partial upfront Compute Savings Plan with a $2.00/hour
commitment.
In any hour, your Savings Plans apply to your usage starting with the highest
discount percentage (30 percent).
Your $2.00/hour commitment is used to cover approximately 2.9 units of this
usage. The remaining 1.1 units are charged at On-Demand rates, resulting in
$1.14 of On-Demand charges for r5.
The rest of your usage are also charged at On-Demand rates, resulting in $55.10
of On-Demand charges. The total On-Demand charges for this usage are $56.24.
### Scenario 3: Savings Plans and EC2 reserved instances apply to the usage
You purchase a one-year, partial upfront Compute Savings Plan with an
$18.20/hour commitment. You have two EC2 Reserved Instances (RI) for r5.4xlarge
Linux shared tenancy in us-east-1.
First, the Reserve Instances covers two of the r5.4xlarge instances. Then, the
Savings Plans rate is applied to the remaining r5.4xlarge and the rest of the usage,
which exhausts the hourly commitment of $18.20.
### Scenario 4: Multiple Savings Plans apply to the usage
You purchase a one-year, partial upfront EC2 Instance Family Savings Plan for
the r5 family in us-east-1 with a $3.00/hour commitment. You also have
a one-year, partial upfront Compute Savings Plan with a $16.80/hour commitment.
Your EC2 Instance Family Savings Plan (r5, us-east-1) covers all of the
r5.4xlarge usage because multiplying the usage by the EC2 Instance Family
Savings Plan rate is $2.40. This is less than the $3.00/hour commitment.
Next, the Compute Savings Plan is applied to rest of the resource usage, if it
doesn't cover the whole expense, then On demand rates will apply.
# EC2 Instance savings plan versus reserved instances
I've been comparing the EC2 Reserved Instances and of the EC2 instance family savings plans and decided to go with the second because:
- They both have almost the same rates. Reserved instances round the price at the 3rd decimal and the savings plan at the fourth, but this difference is neglegible.
- Savings plan are easier to calculate, as you just need to multiply the number of instances you want times the current rate and add them all up.
- Easier to understand: To reserve instances you need to take into account the instance flexibility and the normalization factors which makes it difficult both to make the plans and also to audit how well you're using it.
- Easier to audit: In addition to the above point, you have nice dashboards to see the coverage and utilization over time of your ec2 instance savings plans, which are at the same place as the other savings plans.
# [Understanding how reserved instances are applied](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/apply_ri.html)
WARNING: Don't use reserved instances, use EC2 family savings plans.
A Reserved Instance that is purchased for a Region is called a regional Reserved Instance, and provides Availability Zone and instance size flexibility.
- The Reserved Instance discount applies to instance usage in any Availability Zone in that Region.
- The Reserved Instance discount applies to instance usage within the instance family, regardless of sizeâ€”this is known as instance size flexibility.
With instance size flexibility, the Reserved Instance discount applies to instance usage for instances that have the same family, generation, and attribute. The Reserved Instance is applied from the smallest to the largest instance size within the instance family based on the normalization factor.
The discount applies either fully or partially to running instances of the same instance family, depending on the instance size of the reservation, in any Availability Zone in the Region. The only attributes that must be matched are the instance family, tenancy, and platform.
The following table lists the different sizes within an instance family, and the corresponding normalization factor. This scale is used to apply the discounted rate of Reserved Instances to the normalized usage of the instance family.
| Instance size | 	Normalization factor |
| --- | --- |
| nano | 	0.25 |
| micro | 	0.5 |
| small | 	1 |
| medium | 	2 |
| large | 	4 |
| xlarge | 	8 |
| 2xlarge | 	16 |
| 3xlarge | 	24 |
| 4xlarge | 	32 |
| 6xlarge | 	48 |
| 8xlarge | 	64 |
| 9xlarge | 	72 |
| 10xlarge | 	80 |
| 12xlarge | 	96 |
| 16xlarge | 	128 |
