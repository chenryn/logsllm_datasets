#### 6.6.10.1 Conflict History Tab for Log-Based Method

**Note:** The "View Data" link and "Conflict Details" window, which are available in multi-master replication systems configured with the trigger-based method, are not available in systems using the log-based method.

- **Source DB and Target DB Columns:** These columns provide the IP addresses and database names of the source and target master nodes involved in the conflict.
- **SQL Query for Pending Conflicts:** You can retrieve information about unresolved conflicts using a SQL query instead of the xDB Replication Console graphical user interface. Run the following query from a master node to display details of pending (unresolved) conflicts:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    conflict_type,
    table_name,
    pk_value,
    d1.db_host AS src_db_host,
    d1.db_port AS src_db_port,
    d1.db_name AS src_db_name,
    src_rrep_sync_id,
    d2.db_host AS target_db_host,
    d2.db_port AS target_db_port,
    d2.db_name AS target_db_name,
    target_rrep_sync_id,
    c.notes
FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts c
JOIN _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_pub_database d1 ON c.src_db_id = d1.pub_db_id
JOIN _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_pub_database d2 ON c.target_db_id = d2.pub_db_id
JOIN _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tables t ON c.table_id = t.table_id
WHERE resolution_status = 'P'
ORDER BY t.table_name;
```

**Example Output:**

| RECORD 1 |   |
|----------|---|
| conflict_type | II |
| table_name | dept |
| pk_value | deptno=50 |
| src_db_host | 192.168.2.22 |

| target_db_port | 5444 |
| target_db_name | mmrnode |
| target_rrep_sync_id | 42289824 |

#### 6.6.10.2 Conflict Resolution Concept for the Log-Based Method

Manual conflict resolution typically involves modifying rows in one or more publication tables to correct erroneous entries. This can be done using tools like PSQL or pgAdmin (Postgres Enterprise Manager Client in Advanced Server).

**Key Points:**
- **Isolated Modifications:** Changes must be limited to the specific publication tables being modified and should not be replicated to other master nodes.
- **Preventing Replication:** To prevent the xDB Replication Server from replicating changes during synchronization, use a transaction block that includes a reference to an xDB control schema table. For example:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
-- One or more SQL statements to correct publication tables
COMMIT;
```

When this transaction block is executed on a master node, the changes within it are not replicated to other master nodes during the next synchronization.

#### 6.6.10.3 Overview of Correction Strategies

Before starting manual conflict resolution, determine the extent of inconsistencies in the publication tables across the master nodes.

**Steps:**
1. **Stop the Publication Server:** Use the stop option of the Linux scripts or Windows services described in Section 5.2.1.
2. **Analyze Tables:** Determine which publication tables contain inconsistent rows across master nodes.
3. **Manual Corrections:** Make necessary corrections to the rows in the publication tables across all master nodes to achieve a consistent state.
4. **Apply Transactions:** Ensure all publication tables are updated consistently according to the desired result.
5. **Update Control Schema:** In the control schema of the controller database, update indicators to show that conflicts have been resolved.
6. **Resume Operation:** Start the publication server and recreate the replication schedule if needed.

#### 6.6.10.4 Manual Publication Table Correction

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Ensure Consistency:**
   - On `mmrnode_a`, correct the row:
     ```sql
     BEGIN;
     UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
     UPDATE edb.dept SET dname = 'MARKETING', loc = 'LOS ANGELES' WHERE deptno = 50;
     COMMIT;
     ```

   - On `mmrnode_c`, insert the missing row:
     ```sql
     BEGIN;
     UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
     INSERT INTO edb.dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
     COMMIT;
     ```

2. **Update Control Schema:**
   - Modify the entry in the `xdb_conflicts` table in the control schema of the controller database to indicate the conflict has been resolved.

**Note:** Entries in the `xdb_conflicts` table only affect the data in the Conflict History tab and the SQL query. They do not impact future replication operations but serve as a record of past conflict resolutions.
