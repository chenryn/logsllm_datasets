Acoustic feature based methods for attack detection have wide
applicability, but they all have very limited effectiveness [14, 21,
45, 49, 52]. Current commercial voice authentication system like
VoiceVault and Nuance, mostly rely on the challenge-response based
methods to detect replay attacks. Such methods however require ex-
plicit user cooperation in addition to standard voice authentication
process, which could be cumbersome. Recent proposed smartphone
based solutions however require the user to hold or move the phone
in some predefined manners. In particular, Chen et al. [17] propose
a smartphone based voice authentication system by measuring
the magnetic fields emitted from loudspeakers and thus differen-
tiating them from the live users. It however requires the users to
rotate the smartphone around their heads while speaking the given
passphrase. VoiceLive [55] measures the time-difference-of-arrival
(TDoA) changes to the two microphones of the smartphone to pin-
point the sound origins within a live user’s vocal track for liveness
detection. While effective, it does require the phones to be held in
front of the users’ mouths and thus force the majority of the users
(who hold the phone by their ears) to change their habitual ways of
speaking on phones. In contrast, our system is transparent to users
and covers more user cases as it works when holding the phones
either to the user’s ears or in front of their mouths. Moreover, our
system is less susceptible to environmental noises as it senses artic-
ulatory gestures by actively emitting high frequency sound waves
(which could be easily separated from noises) as oppose to passively
listen to the voices that mixed with background noises in VoiceLive.
Speech Synthesize Attack. This type of attacks assume the
attacker is capable of synthesizing the target’s voice by using speech
synthesize techniques. De Leon et al. [18] proposed a relative phase
shift feature for GMM-UBM or SVM based speaker verification
system. Experiments show this feature can lower the FAR to 2.5%.
Also, Wu et al. [51] evaluated state-of-the-art systems on defending
speech synthesis attacks. Results show an overall average EER of
less than 1.5% is achieved. Recent work done by Leow et al. [33]
utilized concatenation artifacts on the spectrogram to detect US-
based synthesized speech attacks, it obtains an EER of 15.2% for
16000Hz utterances. Furthermore, Adobe’s recent work VoCo [8]
allows the users to edit texts and synthesize corresponding speeches
of a given speaker with only 20 minutes of the voice samples of
him/her. Though hasn’t been evaluated as replay attacks, VoCo
might introduce severe potential threats to voice authentication
systems as well.

tate victim’s voice through voice conversion or manipulation pro-
cess using existing user voice samples. Conducting voice conversion
requires expertise or specialized equipment, however involves no
human efforts. Earlier study by Kinnunen et al. [23] indicated text-
independent speaker verification systems are vulnerable against
voice conversion attacks using telephone speech. Besides, Kons
et al. [28] evaluate several common speaker verification systems,
including the I-vector, GMM-NAP, and HMM-NAP based systems,
under voice conversion attacks. Results show that they overall gain
4-fold increases in EER, and FAR of HMM-NAP system increase
from 1% to 36%. Recently, Wu et al. [50] developed an authenti-
cation system with PLDA component that defends against voice
conversion attacks with 1.71% FAR, whereas Alegre et al. utilize
PLDA and FA technologies and achieve the FAR rate of 1.6% [13].
Further, Sizov et al. [42] propose an i-vectors and PLDA based gen-
eral countermeasure to unknown types of voice conversion attacks,
it’s claimed that this method could bring EER to as low as 0.54%.
Impersonation Attack. Different from other types of attack, it
indicates an adversary would launch an attack without using any
professional devices by only relying on impersonating the target’s
voice. Comparing with other types of attacks, impersonation at-
tacks are less accessible and less risky to authentication systems.
Indeed, Wu et al. [48] suggest the impersonators may capable of
mimicking the F0 pattern and speaking rates of the victims, but
it’s barely possible for them to fake the spectral characteristics like
formants. Therefore impersonation attacks may fool human listens
but not authentication systems. Recent work shows by utilizing
state-of-the-art speaker model like i-vector models [20] and GMM-
UBM [16], the impersonation attack can be effectively mitigated.
Furthermore, even with professional mimicry artists or linguists,
those common speaker authentication systems maintain consider-
able effectiveness [19, 37].
7 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we developed a voice liveness detection system that
requires only a speaker and a microphone that are commonly avail-
able on smartphones. Our system, VoiceGesture, is practical as
no cumbersome operations are required besides the conversional
voice authentication process. Once it is integrated with voice au-
thentication system, the liveness detection is transparent to the
users. VoiceGesture performs liveness detection by extracting fea-
tures in the Doppler shifts that caused by the articulatory gesture
when a user speaks a passphrase. Extensive experimental evalua-
tion demonstrates the effectiveness of our system under various
conditions, such as with different phone types, placements and sam-
pling rates. Overall, VoiceGesture can achieve over 99% accuracy,
with the EER at around 1%.
