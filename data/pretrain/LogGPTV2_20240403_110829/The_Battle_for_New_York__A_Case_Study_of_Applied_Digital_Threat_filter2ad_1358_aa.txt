## Abstract

Digital security professionals use threat modeling to assess and enhance the security posture of organizations or products. However, no threat-modeling techniques have been systematically evaluated in a real-world, enterprise environment. This case study introduces formalized threat modeling to New York City Cyber Command (NYC3), the primary digital defense organization for the most populous city in the United States.

We found that threat modeling improved self-efficacy; 20 out of 25 participants regularly incorporated it into their daily duties 30 days after training, without further prompting. After 120 days, participant-designed threat mitigation strategies provided tangible security benefits for NYC, including blocking 541 unique intrusion attempts, preventing the hijacking of five privileged user accounts, and addressing three public-facing server vulnerabilities. These results suggest that the introduction of threat modeling can provide valuable benefits in an enterprise setting.

## Introduction

Threat modeling is a structured process for assessing digital risks and developing mitigation strategies, with origins dating back over 30 years. It is commonly recommended in industry and academia as a useful tool for mitigating risk in software, systems, and enterprises. Despite numerous proposed approaches, few provide efficacy metrics, and almost none have been systematically evaluated in an enterprise environment. This makes it challenging to quantify the practical benefits of threat modeling.

In this paper, we present the first case study of threat modeling in a large, high-risk enterprise environment: New York City Cyber Command (NYC3). NYC3 is responsible for defending the most populous city in the United States from cyber attacks, supporting a digital infrastructure that serves 60 million visitors and 300,000 government employees annually.

Prior to our study, NYC3 did not use threat modeling but protected its assets primarily through vendor technologies meeting city-specific and industry guidelines. As part of a unique cooperative opportunity, we introduced 25 NYC3 personnel to an exemplar threat-modeling approach through group training sessions. We then tracked the impact of this training on NYC3’s security posture quantitatively, through analysis of 120 days of log data, and qualitatively, via pre-, post-, and 30-day-post-training surveys with participants. To our knowledge, this represents the largest-scale real-world evaluation of threat modeling efficacy to date.

Our results indicate that threat modeling may provide valuable benefits in an enterprise setting. Participants' perceptions of threat modeling were very positive: 23 out of 25 participants agreed that it was useful in their daily work, and 20 reported adopting its concepts into their daily routine. Collectively, participants developed 147 unique mitigation strategies, of which 64% were new and unimplemented within NYC3. Additionally, participants identified new threats in eight distinct areas, such as physical access-control weaknesses and human configuration errors. Within one week, NYC3 employees started implementing participant-designed plans to mitigate these newly-identified threat categories.

In the 120 days following our study, NYC3 implemented participant-designed defensive strategies that prevented five privileged account hijackings, mitigated 541 unique intrusion attempts, and remedied three previously unknown web-server vulnerabilities. While our findings are drawn from a single enterprise environment, NYC3 shares many similarities with many U.S. enterprises today, such as the use of widely-mandated compliance standards, pervasive vendor technologies, and the mission to protect a spectrum of organizations ranging from the financial sector to law enforcement. Consequently, our observations and metrics provide a foundation for future work on threat modeling and enterprise-employee security training.

## Background

### Threat-Modeling Frameworks

Threat modeling is a structured approach to assessing risks and developing plans to mitigate those risks. Many frameworks aim to improve practitioners’ situational awareness and provide a decision-making process for complex problems. Some frameworks focus on thinking like an adversary, helping practitioners identify and block essential tasks that would lead to a successful attack. Other frameworks help users automatically or manually identify likely threats based on past data and ongoing trends.

### The Center of Gravity (CoG) Framework

In this study, we introduced NYC3 employees to the Center of Gravity (CoG) framework, which originated in the 19th century as a military strategy. As a military concept, a center of gravity is the "primary entity that possesses the inherent capability to achieve the objective." As a threat modeling approach, CoG focuses on identifying and defending this central resource. This approach is applicable in any contested domain and is synonymous with centrality, which appears in network theory for social groups and the digital domain. CoG supports planning offensive cyberspace operations and prioritizing digital defenses.

The constraints of our partnership with NYC3, particularly the requirement to minimize employees' time away from their duties, allowed us to introduce and examine only one threat modeling framework. We selected CoG because it incorporates key characteristics from more pervasive frameworks: it provides a top-down approach to identifying internal points of vulnerability, similar to STRIDE, and assists with assessing vulnerabilities from an adversarial perspective, similar to attack trees, security cards, persona non grata, and the cyber kill chain. Uniquely among popular threat modeling approaches, it allows organizations to prioritize defensive efforts based on risk priority.

### Empirically Evaluating Threat Models

A limited number of threat-modeling frameworks have been empirically evaluated, and none have been assessed at the enterprise level. Previous studies compared the effectiveness of different frameworks using student groups and measured perceived effectiveness through post-study questionnaires. In our study, we do not compare different frameworks but use one particular approach as a case study to examine the introduction of threat modeling within an enterprise environment. We utilize qualitative research methods and aggregate quantitative data to determine how well threat modeling protects digital systems.

## Case Study: Threat Modeling at NYC3

To evaluate the impact of introducing threat modeling to an organization that had not previously used it, we partnered with NYC3 to introduce the CoG framework and observe the effects. NYC3 is responsible for protecting the most populous city in the U.S. and its government from cyber attacks. The Government of the City of New York (GoNYC) includes 143 separate departments, agencies, and offices with more than 300,000 employees that support 8.6 million residents and 60 million yearly visitors. It maintains nearly 200,000 external IP addresses and has its own Internet Service Provider, with hundreds of miles of fiber-optic cable and dozens of major points of presence. Additionally, the city is responsible for maintaining industrial control and mainframe systems. Our participant pool consisted of civil servants and private-sector contractors who work directly with NYC3.

Throughout this study, we focused on the efficacy of threat modeling, defined as the ability to achieve a desired outcome. Both effectiveness (the ability to successfully achieve an outcome) and efficiency (the ability to reduce effort to achieve an outcome) comprise efficacy.

### Recruitment

NYC3 leadership sent all employees an email outlining the voluntary nature of the study, its motivation, and goals. The email informed employees that they would be introduced to new techniques that could potentially streamline their daily duties and that the findings would be applied to defending NYC3 systems and networks. The study was conducted during participants' regularly scheduled work hours, and no additional monetary incentives were provided.

### Study Protocol

We designed a multi-part study protocol, as follows:

#### Protocol Pilot

Before deploying our protocol with participants, we conducted three iterations of the study using non-NYC3 employees (two security practitioners and one large-organization chief information security officer) to pre-test for relevance, clarity, and validity. We updated the study protocol based on pilot feedback and overall study flow.

#### Baseline Survey

Establishing a baseline for NYC3's defensive practices allowed us to compare the security posture before and after the training intervention. We asked participants about their specific work role, responsibilities, demographics, understanding of organizational mission statements, the assets they use to accomplish their daily duties, their sentiment towards NYC3’s current security posture, and their perceived self-efficacy for performing digital security tasks. We used a combination of open-ended, close-ended, and Likert-scale questions in our 29-question online survey. We used an identical structure for the post-training survey and 30-day follow-up survey to measure changes in self-efficacy.

#### Educational Intervention

After completing the initial survey, we provided groups of participants with in-person instruction on the history of CoG, its application as a threat modeling technique, the CoG process, and two examples of applying the framework. We scheduled three independent sessions and allowed participants to choose the session most convenient to their work schedule.

We based our 60-minute educational intervention on fundamentals from adult learning research and experiential learning theory (ELT). Kolb and Kolb found that adults learn new concepts better through ELT by integrating new concepts into existing ones, accommodating existing concepts to account for the new concepts, and "experiencing, reflecting, and acting" to reinforce the new concepts. Social learning theory (SLT) further supports this process, indicating that adults learn new patterns of behavior best through direct experience. Thus, our class was designed to reinforce each concept with hands-on exercises using scenarios relevant to the audience and their domain knowledge.

During the class, the instructor introduced participants to tabular and graph-based methods for performing CoG.
