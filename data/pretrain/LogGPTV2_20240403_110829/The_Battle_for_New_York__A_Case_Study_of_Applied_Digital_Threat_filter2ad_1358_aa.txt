Abstract
Digital security professionals use threat modeling to
assess and improve the security posture of an organiza-
tion or product. However, no threat-modeling techniques
have been systematically evaluated in a real-world, enter-
prise environment. In this case study, we introduce for-
malized threat modeling to New York City Cyber Com-
mand: the primary digital defense organization for the
most populous city in the United States.
We ﬁnd that threat modeling improved self-efﬁcacy;
20 of 25 participants regularly incorporated it within
their daily duties 30 days after training, without further
prompting. After 120 days, implemented participant-
designed threat mitigation strategies provided tangi-
ble security beneﬁts for NYC, including blocking 541
unique intrusion attempts, preventing the hijacking of
ﬁve privileged user accounts, and addressing three
public-facing server vulnerabilities. Overall, these re-
sults suggest that the introduction of threat modeling can
provide valuable beneﬁts in an enterprise setting.

Threat modeling — a structured process for assessing
digital risks and developing mitigation strategies — orig-
inated more than 30 years ago and is commonly recom-
mended in industry and academia as a useful tool for mit-
igating risk in software, systems, and enterprises [57].
While a number of threat-modeling approaches have
been proposed, few provide efﬁcacy metrics, and essen-
tially none have been systematically evaluated in an en-
terprise environment [9, 14, 15, 20, 24, 25, 28, 34, 35, 37,
38, 42, 46, 53]. As a result, it can be difﬁcult to quantify
the beneﬁt of threat modeling in practice.

In this paper, we present the ﬁrst case study of threat
modeling in a large, high-risk enterprise environment:
New York City Cyber Command (NYC3).1 NYC3 is
responsible for defending the most populous city in the
United States from cyber attacks, including a digital in-
frastructure that supports 60 million visitors and 300,000
government employees each year.
Similar to many other enterprise organizations, prior
to our study, NYC3 did not use threat modeling but
protected its assets primarily via vendor technologies
meeting city-speciﬁc and industry guidelines. As part
of a unique cooperative opportunity, we introduced 25
NYC3 personnel to an exemplar threat-modeling ap-
proach through group training sessions. We then tracked
the impact of this threat modeling training on NYC3’s
security posture quantitatively, through analysis of 120
days of log data, and qualitatively, via pre-, post-, and
30-day-post-training surveys with participants. To our
knowledge, this represents the largest-scale real-world
evaluation of threat modeling efﬁcacy to date.
Our results suggest that threat modeling may pro-
vide valuable beneﬁts in an enterprise setting. Partic-
ipants’ perceptions of threat modeling were very posi-
tive: after 30 days, 23 participants agreed that it was
useful in their daily work and 20 reported that they
have adopted its concepts in their daily routine. Col-
lectively, participants developed 147 unique mitigation
strategies, of which 64% were new and unimplemented
within NYC3. Additionally, participants identiﬁed new
threats in eight distinct areas within their environment,
such as physical access-control weaknesses and human
conﬁguration errors. Within one week of develop-
ing these plans, NYC3 employees started implementing
participant-designed plans to mitigate these eight newly-
identiﬁed threat categories.
In the 120 days following
our study, NYC3 implemented participant-designed de-
fensive strategies that prevented ﬁve privileged account
hijackings, mitigated 541 unique intrusion attempts, and
remedied three previously unknown web-server vulnera-

bilities.
While our ﬁndings are drawn from a single enter-
prise environment, NYC3 shares many similarities to
many U.S. enterprises today, such as the use of widely-
mandated compliance standards [29, 44, 45], use of per-
vasive vendor technologies, and the mission to protect
a spectrum of organizations ranging from the ﬁnancial
sector to law enforcement [13].2 Consequently, our ob-
servations and metrics provide a scaffolding for future
work on threat modeling and enterprise-employee secu-
rity training.
2 Background
In this section, we describe threat modeling, detail the
speciﬁc threat-modeling approach we used in this study,
and brieﬂy review prior empirical studies of threat mod-
eling.
2.1 Threat-modeling frameworks
Threat modeling is a structured approach to assess-
ing risks and developing plans to mitigate those risks.
Many threat-modeling frameworks aim to improve prac-
titioners’ situational awareness and provide them with a
decision-making process for complex problems [15, 25].
Some frameworks focus on thinking like an adversary,
helping practitioners identify and block essential tasks
that would lead to a successful attack [9,14,28,43]. Other
frameworks help users automatically or manually iden-
tify likely threats to a particular system based on past
data and ongoing trends [38, 39, 53, 54, 57].
2.2 The Center of Gravity framework
In this study, we introduced NYC3 employees to the
Center of Gravity (CoG) framework, which originated in
the 19th century as a military strategy [64]. As a military
concept, a center of gravity is the “primary entity that
possesses the inherent capability to achieve the objec-
tive [17].” As a threat modeling approach, CoG focuses
on identifying and defending this central resource. This
approach is applicable within any contested domain [60]
and is synonymous with centrality, which appears in net-
work theory for social groups [30] and network theory
in the digital domain [62]. CoG supports planning of-
fensive cyberspace operations [8] and prioritizing digital
defenses [11].
The constraints of our partnership with NYC3 —
in particular, the requirement to minimize employees’
time away from their duties — only allowed us to in-
troduce and examine one threat modeling framework.
We selected CoG because it incorporates many key
characteristics from across more pervasive frameworks:
CoG provides practitioners with a top-down approach
to identifying internal points of vulnerability, similar to
STRIDE [38, 39], and it assists with assessing vulner-
abilities from an adversarial perspective, similar to at-
tack trees, security cards, persona non grata, and cyber
kill chain [9, 14, 28, 54]. Uniquely among popular threat
modeling approaches, it allows organizations to priori-
tize defensive efforts based on risk priority.
We next brieﬂy describe the process of applying the
CoG approach. Figure 1 illustrates these steps using an
example provided by one participant.
To begin using CoG, analysts must start by codifying
the long-term organizational objective, or “end state,” of
defensive measures. An end state provides the why for
implementing defenses and allows an individual practi-
tioner to understand their own speciﬁc security objective
with respect to the organization.
Once the practitioner understands their objective, the
next step is to identify all of the assets currently in use
that support accomplishing the objective. In this context,

an asset can be a system, a service, a tool, or anything
relevant to accomplishing the objective (not just security-
speciﬁc assets). The practitioner then identiﬁes the CoG
as the pivotal asset on which all other assets depend for
accomplishing the objective.
Once the practitioner identiﬁes the CoG, they can de-
construct it into three components: critical capabilities,
critical requirements, and critical vulnerabilities [17].
Critical capabilities (CC) are distinguished by two key
features: they support the practitioner’s objectives, and
the CoG would cease to operate without them [21]. For
each CC, there are one or more critical requirements
(CR), deﬁned as supporting resources that enable the CC
to function [21]. Eikmeier distinguishes between ca-
pabilities and requirements using a “does/uses” litmus
test [17]: If the CoG does something, that something is
a capability, and if it uses something, that something is
a requirement. Critical vulnerabilities (CV) are directly
related to critical requirements; CVs are thresholds of di-
minished CRs that make the CoG inoperable [55]. Prac-
titioners identify CVs by asking the following question
for each CR: what would cause this requirement to no
longer function as intended? Some CVs are binary, such
as the complete loss of a CR, but others may cause a re-
duced functionality beyond some threshold, preventing
the CoG from accomplishing the objective.
Building a thorough list of critical vulnerabilities al-
lows the practitioner to understand how their objectives
can be threatened. The practitioner should consider both
malicious and accidental threats to collectively describe
the worst-case situation for their organization and objec-
tives. The CoG approach models all threats with a sin-
gular, uniﬁed motivation: exploiting critical vulnerabili-
ties. This allows practitioners to develop a list of threats
that can encompass nation-state hackers, insiders, poorly
trained users, and others. The practitioner iterates over
the list of critical vulnerabilities to develop a correspond-
ing list of threat capabilities (TC). For each CV, they ask:
what could take advantage of this vulnerable condition?
From the list of TCs, they enumerate all of the threat re-
quirements (TR) needed to support each capability.
The ﬁnal step in the CoG analysis process is build-
ing an actionable defense plan (ADP) that can neutralize
identiﬁed threat capabilities and requirements, mitigate
critical vulnerabilities, and protect the identiﬁed CoG.
Each component of an ADP, designed to dampen or elim-
inate one or more potential risks, is referred to as a miti-
gation strategy.
2.3 Empirically evaluating threat models
A limited number of threat-modeling frameworks have
been empirically evaluated, and none have been assessed
at the enterprise level. Sindre and Opdahl [50, 58] com-
pared the effectiveness of attack trees against misuse
Figure 2: Our six-part study protocol and metrics.
cases and Labunets et al. [32] compared CORAS [34]
against SREP [37]. In both of these empirical studies, re-
searchers measured the effectiveness of each framework
by quantitatively comparing output from student groups.
Additionally, these studies measured the perceived effec-
tiveness of the frameworks through post-study question-
naires based on the Technology Acceptance Model [12].
Massacci et al. [35] used small groups of industry practi-
tioners and students to compare the performance of four
threat models [20,24,34,42] against ﬁctional scenarios in
a classroom environment, largely based on participants’
perception of the frameworks.
In our study, we do not compare different frame-
works to each other. Instead, we use one particular ap-
proach as a case study to examine the introduction of
threat-modeling within an enterprise environment, using
participants with a direct, vested interest in improving
their job performance and the security posture of their
environment. We utilize qualitative research methods
based on studies from Sindre, Opdahl, Labunets, and
Moody [32, 41, 50] while aggregating quantitative data
to determine how well threat modeling protects digital
systems.
3 Case study: Threat modeling at NYC3
To evaluate the impact of introducing threat modeling to
an organization that had not previously used it, we part-
nered with NYC3 to introduce a speciﬁc threat-modeling
framework (CoG) and observe the effects. NYC3 is re-
sponsible for protecting the most populous city in the
U.S. and its government from cyber attacks. The Gov-
ernment of the City of New York (GoNYC) includes 143
separate departments, agencies, and ofﬁces with more
than 300,000 employees that support 8.6 million resi-
dents and 60 million yearly visitors [48].
It maintains
nearly 200,000 external IP addresses and has its own In-

ternet Service Provider, with hundreds of miles of ﬁber-
optic cable and dozens of major points of presence. Fur-
ther, the city is responsible for maintaining industrial
control and mainframe systems. We drew our participant
pool from the civil servants and private-sector contrac-
tors who work directly with NYC3.
Throughout this study we focus on the efﬁcacy of
threat modeling, which in this context we deﬁne as the
ability to achieve a desired outcome. Both effectiveness,
the ability to successfully achieve an outcome, and efﬁ-
ciency, the ability to reduce effort to achieve an outcome,
comprise efﬁcacy.
Because we introduced threat modeling in NYC3’s op-
erational environment, we were not able to conduct a
comparative experiment; instead, we designed a primar-
ily observational study to obtain as much insight as possi-
ble — both qualitative and quantitative — into the effects
of introducing threat modeling within an enterprise envi-
ronment. Our study includes six components (as shown
in Figure 2), that occurred from June through November
2017, and was approved by the University of Maryland
Institutional Review Board. Due to the study’s sensitive
nature, we generalized some details about defenses and
vulnerabilities to protect NYC. Additionally, we redacted
sensitive information when quoting participants and gen-
eralized job descriptions so as to not deanonymize partic-
ipants.
3.1 Recruitment
NYC3 leadership sent all of its employees an email
that outlined the voluntary nature of our study as well
as our motivation and goals. The email informed NYC3
employees that they would be introduced to new tech-
niques that could potentially streamline their daily duties,
and that the ﬁndings from the study would be directly
applied to defending NYC3 systems and networks. We
conducted the study during participants’ regularly sched-
uled work hours and did not provide them with any addi-
tional monetary incentives for participating.
3.2 Study protocol
We designed a multi-part study protocol, as follows.
Protocol pilot. Prior to deploying our protocol with par-
ticipants, we conducted three iterations of the study us-
ing non-NYC3 employees (two security practitioners and
one large-organization chief information security ofﬁcer)
to pre-test for relevance, clarity, and validity. We updated
the study protocol based on pilot feedback and overall
study ﬂow. After three iterations, we arrived at the ﬁnal
protocol described below.
Baseline survey. Establishing a baseline for NYC3 de-
fensive practices allows us to compare the security pos-
ture before and after our training intervention. We asked
participants about their speciﬁc work role, responsibil-
ities, and demographics; their understanding of organi-
zational mission statements; which assets they use to
accomplish their daily duties; their sentiment towards
NYC3’s current security posture; and their perceived
self-efﬁcacy for performing digital security tasks.
We used a combination of open-ended, close-ended,
and Likert-scale questions in our 29-question online sur-
vey (App. B). We based all self-efﬁcacy questions on
best-practices and question-creation guides from estab-
lished educational psychology studies [5]. We used an
identical structure for the post-training survey and 30-
day follow-up survey. Capturing self-efﬁcacy before, im-
mediately after, and 30 days after receiving the educa-
tional intervention allowed us to measure how each par-
ticipant perceived the model’s efﬁcacy. We were inter-
ested in measuring efﬁcacy perceptions, as self-efﬁcacy
has been shown to be an important component of indi-
vidual success at performing job duties in enterprise set-
tings [4]; one key component of self-efﬁcacy is belief in
the efﬁcacy of the tools you use to complete tasks.
Educational intervention. After completing the ini-
tial survey, we provided groups of participants with in-
person instruction on the history of CoG, its application
as a threat modeling technique, the CoG process outlined
in Section 2.2, and two examples of applying the frame-
work. We scheduled three independent sessions and al-
lowed participants to choose the session most convenient
to their work schedule.
We based our 60-minute educational intervention on
fundamentals from adult learning research and the expe-
riential learning theory (ELT) [31]. Kolb and Kolb found
that adults learn new concepts better through ELT by (1)
integrating new concepts into existing ones, (2) accom-
modating existing concepts to account for the new con-
cepts, and (3) “experiencing, reﬂecting, and acting” to
reinforce the new concepts [31]. Social learning theory
(SLT) further supports this process, indicating that adults
learn new patterns of behavior best through direct experi-
ence [6]. Thus, our class was designed to reinforce each
concept with a hands-on exercise using scenarios rele-
vant to the audience and their domain knowledge.
During the class, the instructor introduced participants
to tabular and graph-based methods performing CoG
