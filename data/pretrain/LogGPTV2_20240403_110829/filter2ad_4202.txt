ABSTRACT
The Internet is organized as a collection of administrative domains,
known as Autonomous Systems (ASes). These ASes interact through
the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that allows them to share reach-
ability information. Adjacent routers in distinct ASes use external
BGP (eBGP), whereas in a given AS routes are propagated over
internal BGP (iBGP) sessions between any pair of routers. In large
ASes where a logical full-mesh is not possible, confederations or
route reﬂectors (RRs) are used. However, these somewhat scalable
alternatives have introduced their own set of unpredictable effects
(persistent routing oscillations and forwarding loops causing an in-
crease of the convergence time) addressed in the literature [1].
The solution we propose to these issues consists of a structured
routing overlay holding a comprehensive view of the routes. We
describe the design of a distributed entity that performs BGP route
pre-computation for its clients inside a large backbone network and
propagates the paths to the routers. Compared to the current iBGP
routing, the advantage of the overlay approach is the separation
between the responsibility of the control plane (route storage and
best path computation) and the forwarding of the packets.
One of the major improvements we bring is the divided rout-
ing table tackling the scalability concerns and allowing for parallel
computation of paths.

1. TODAY’S ROUTING PARADIGM
In this work we focus on improving the scalability of BGP intra-
domain routing, keeping eBGP untouched. The current iBGP ar-
chitecture suffers from multiple drawbacks:
• Scalability - quantiﬁed by the number of sessions a router
is required to handle and the number of preﬁxes in the BGP
table. During the last decade, the Internet BGP routing table
has expanded, growing from 100, 000 preﬁxes in 2001 to
approximatively 320, 000 in 2010.
• Incomplete visibility of routing information - a border router
of an AS has several possible paths to a given IP preﬁx. After

the decision process, it selects and advertises only its single
best route among all the possible ones, reducing the knowl-
edge of the routers inside the network [2]. This incomplete
view of eBGP-learned routes may lead to suboptimal egress
point selection, non-deterministic protocol behavior, path ex-
ploration, delayed convergence [3].
• Complex routing policy management - the routing policy of
an AS is subject to misconﬁgurations and inconsistencies
given the heterogenous nature of routing equipment in an
AS. It is difﬁcult to build and maintain automatic tools to
consistently manage the entire collection of routes in BGP
networks.
2. SEPARATION OF IBGP PLANE
In today’s IP networks, routing is done in a distributed manner,
on every router in the network. We propose to detach the two pro-
cesses of building the routing table (routing plane) and the forward-
ing of trafﬁc (data plane) on two distant hardwares. This ofﬂoading
of the control plane from the actual routers to dedicated nodes may
be regarded as a natural evolution in routing, driven by the increas-
ing table size.
We reconsider the current design with a separate iBGP routing
plane concentrating the full knowledge of routing data. A detached
plane would help to solve issues about visibility and diversity of
routing information and also permit a more consistent management
of the routing policy. Such a separation relieves routers from the
overhead of the BGP routing process as it allows for distant storage
of the routing information and further customized processing ac-
cording to rules speciﬁc to the client routers. Our proposal is based
on a logical overlay of routing processes (or nodes) that are jointly
responsible for the following:
• collect, split and store the complete set of eBGP-received
routes and the internally originated routes,
• store the routing policies and the conﬁgurations of all the
routers within the AS,
• compute BGP routes for each router,
• redistribute the computed paths to the routers.
One of the most challenging issues for an iBGP architecture is its
ability to scale, or in other terms to support increasing routing table
size and messages over time. To design a scalable solution, the
iBGP overlay is split into n sub-planes, where nodes of the same
sub-plane handle the same routing information for only a fraction
of the entire set of preﬁxes.

Unlike in [4], our solution achieves a division of the routing table
in the overlay, therefore decreasing the charge of protocol data on
the routers and allowing for parallel computation of routes located
on disjoint nodes. If redundancy is sufﬁcient within the overlay,
failures inside the network will have minimal impact on reachabil-
ity inside the AS.
Other studies on centralized routing schemes [5] have shown
encouraging results about faster network convergence. Having a
comparable convergence time, a well designed routing architecture
could be an alternative to link-state protocols.
4. PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSION
The splitting of the routing table sounds appealing, but it comes
at a cost. We want to determine a threshold beyond which the
overhead of computing paths inside the overlay will prevail on the
advantages of such a distributed design. Future work includes an
implementation of the routing table splitting algorithm and its opti-
mization for handling gracefully the dynamic re-organization of the
preﬁxes in the nodes of the overlay. Further, we will concentrate on
an evaluation of the proposed architecture and examine which are
the relevant parameters to be studied, e.g. how to quantify conver-
gence time, scalability and compliance to the routing policy.
We have shown a different approach to intra-domain BGP rout-
ing, bringing architectural advantages. The proposed design offers
better scalability, improved diversity and comparable network con-
vergence time. We estimate that it provides ground for implemen-
tations of extra features, such as multiple BGP paths.

Figure 1: The n = 3 nodes in the overlay each manage a subset
of the preﬁxes found in the total routing table
Upon reception of a reachable preﬁx from eBGP (step 1), a router
forwards this information to the overlay (step 2) and the corre-
sponding sub-plane is determined through a simple IP lookup in
a table containing the previously mentioned set of preﬁxes (step 3).
The subsets of preﬁxes assigned to sub-planes are decided dy-
namically. This allows for a ﬂexible load-sharing of routing data
over the sub-planes, that takes into account the capacities of nodes.
To ensure that each client router receives routing data from the
overlay (step 5) for the full set of preﬁxes, each client router con-
nects to at least one node of each sub-plane.
2.1 Design guidelines
Various assumptions have been made when building this new
architecture. Some important construction aspects are derived from
present needs appearing in Internet routing:
Dynamic load sharing of routing data among planes allows for
splitting, organizing and re-organizing of the various pre-
ﬁxes handled by the overlay nodes. A change in the network
topology graph or an unbalanced distribution of the preﬁxes
over the sub-planes may trigger a redistribution of preﬁxes.
The overlay automatically adjusts the load on the nodes over
time.
Distributed computing of the BGP decision process can improve
convergence time. We believe that parallel processing of the
large amount of control plane data would alleviate today’s
limited routing engines that are handling great loads due to
the BGP activity.
Correlation between best path selection and route propagation is
one of the causes leading to opacity in a network. This is par-
tially due to the fact that each router advertises its best route
and the propagation inside the AS depends on the sparse
router-level graph. Bringing complete visibility to the de-
cision entity enables better route selection, while ensuring
a reasonable number of exchanged routing messages. The
overlay nodes have knowledge of the entire IGP topology
and the routing policy, thus they are able to provide diverse
paths towards the same preﬁx, depending on the position of
the different clients within the IGP topology.
