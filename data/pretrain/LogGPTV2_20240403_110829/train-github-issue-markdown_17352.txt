Atom automatically inserts a newline at the end of a file on save. In my
opinion, this is bad behavior because it is confusing and potentially
problematic to save something that differs from what has been edited.
As one example, if I am editing a file in an existing repo, I don't want to
automatically insert a newline because the resulting diff will distract from
what I'm trying to do.
In addition, it's not just that this happens silently, it's that I can't find
any way to end a file without a newline. Let me edit my files! =)
I couldn't find a setting for this, although I may be missing something. In my
opinion this should not be default behavior in any case.
