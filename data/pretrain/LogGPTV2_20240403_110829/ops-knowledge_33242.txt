I encountered an issue with integrating Google AdSense into my Django application on Google App Engine. After designing the HTML templates for my web application and importing them using the Django template system, I noticed that the AdSense banners were not displaying correctly.

When I open the HTML files directly in my browser, the AdSense banners appear as expected. However, when the same HTML files are rendered through Django, the banners do not show up. Additionally, I created a simple HTML template containing only the AdSense script, and when I load this template through Django, it returns a blank (white) page with no banner or any other content.

I have since resolved the issue. It turned out that I had inadvertently added some characters with incorrect encoding. Once I corrected the encoding, the AdSense banners began to display properly.

If you encounter a similar issue, I recommend checking for any unintended characters or encoding issues in your HTML templates.
