User: I have a problem with Django on Google App Engine. I finished to design html templet for my web application and I imported them on django using django template system. 
The problem is google ad-sense. I can say ad-sense banner on the html version of my pages if i try to open them in my browser. But nothing appear if I try to do the same operation with them loaded in django. 
I also tried to develop a simple html template that contains only the adSense script, if i load this on django it returns a white page. No banner, nothing. 
What can i do to solve this problem?
Assistant: I solved the problem! Sorry, I accidentally added some character with erroneous codeing.
