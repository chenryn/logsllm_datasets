Question: A developer claims that setting the 'HttpOnly' attribute on a session cookie is unnecessary if the website already employs robust server-side security measures. What is the best argument against this claim?
"A": "The 'HttpOnly' attribute is redundant because server-side security can prevent all types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
"B": "The 'HttpOnly' attribute is necessary because it provides an additional layer of defense in depth, potentially mitigating the impact of an XSS attack that bypasses server-side protections.",
"C": "The 'expires' attribute is more important than 'HttpOnly' because it dictates how long the cookie is valid and thus impacts security more directly.",
"D": "The 'Domain' attribute is crucial as it ensures the cookie is sent to the correct domain, making 'HttpOnly' irrelevant."
Answer: B
