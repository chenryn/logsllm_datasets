### Adding Common Charts to a Tabbed Dashboard

#### Scenario:
- I have utilized the Tabs feature to organize multiple dashboards (e.g., Tab 1 and Tab 2).
- There are several charts, such as a date filter, that need to be shared across multiple tabs.

#### Current Issue:
- Once a chart is added to one tab in the tabbed dashboard, it cannot be reused in another tab.
