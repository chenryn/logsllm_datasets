Add charts to Tabbed Dashboard  
Scenario:
  * I have used the Tabs feature to segregate various dashboards (Say Tab 1 and Tab 2).
  * I have a couple of charts that are common to multiple dashboards(say date filter) and would like to add this multiple tabs.  
**Current issue:**
  * Charts used once in a tabbed dashboard cannot be used again in another tab.
