### Access to FOTA Files

#### B. Prevalence
We investigate the prevalence of FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) applications across various devices and vendors using metadata provided by Firmware Scanner. Our analysis reveals that 133 distinct FOTA packages are distributed across 395 different brands. While the majority (67%) of these packages are found on devices from the same brand, some devices include FOTA apps from multiple brands. As anticipated, `com.google.android.gsf` is present in over 95% of the devices in our dataset. Similarly, `com.google.android.gms` is found in 18% of devices from Google-certified OEMs. Additionally, we observe high-prevalence cases such as two FOTAs from Adups and Mediatek, which appear in 578 and 336 devices from 111 and 34 different brands, respectively.

Determining whether a given FOTA is developed by the OEM manufacturing the device is challenging based solely on the certificate information. However, by analyzing the relationships between package names, OEMs, and the organizations signing the FOTA apps, we can gain more insights into the distribution of specific FOTA packages in Android devices. For a graphical illustration, please refer to Figure 3 in Appendix C.

We identify two distinct patterns:

1. **First-Party FOTAs**: These FOTAs exhibit a consistent relationship between packages, brands, and certificate information. For example, the `com.samsung.android.app.omcagent` app found on a "Samsung" device, signed by "Samsung Corporation." Note that in some cases, the brand may reflect Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) due to re-branding, such as "Verizon" devices that are updated by a FOTA app from "Samsung."

2. **Third-Party FOTA Providers**: These include companies like Adups, Redstone, and SoC manufacturers like Qualcomm, which are present in devices from multiple vendors and often signed with different certificates.

**Figure 1: Distribution of FOTA Types in Devices with 1 to 5 FOTAs**
To facilitate visualization, we highlight non-Google packages with higher prevalence in our dataset.

Our findings indicate that 42% of FOTA apps (from 47 packages) are first-party FOTAs, all from the OEM category, while 43% of apps (from 84 packages) are third-party FOTAs. Specifically:
- 10% of apps (from 30 packages) are from OEMs.
- 1.6% of apps (from 4 packages) are from MNOs.
- 9% of apps (from 13 packages) are from SoCs.
- 9% of apps (from 13 packages) belong to the SFD (Specialized Firmware Developer) category.

The remaining FOTAs are either not categorized or belong to Google.

Despite the limitations of this analysis, the results show that a majority of FOTA software in our dataset is not deployed by the OEMs. Instead, they often rely on third parties for updating the entire system or specific hardware components. This externalization of FOTA services means that vendors lose control over critical system components, potentially introducing privacy and security concerns. Users have no control over what is installed via FOTA, and malicious apps can be installed without their knowledge [19]. We further analyze installations through FOTA software in §VII using data from real devices.

**Distribution of FOTAs per Device**
- 80% of devices have Google FOTA components.
- Excluding Google components, 71%, 20%, 8%, 0.8%, and 0.2% of devices have one, two, three, four, and five FOTAs, respectively.

A plausible reason for having multiple FOTAs is to update different components, such as the system itself, hardware drivers, or other apps. Figure 1 shows the distribution of FOTAs per device, grouped by type. We report statistics for devices with 1 to 5 FOTAs. For clarity, we aggregate repeated types (e.g., [SOC, OEM, OEM] and [SOC, SOC, OEM] to [SOC, OEM]).

In general, most devices with one or two FOTAs have them from OEMs (66% and 66%, respectively). In the absence of an OEM FOTA, it is common to see FOTAs from SFDs or SoCs. Combinations of FOTAs from different categories often include one from an SoC, suggesting that these devices include FOTAs for specific hardware components and the system itself. MNOs are less commonly found as FOTA providers.

**Limitations**
- Our analysis is based on 2,013 FOTA apps extracted from 20,924 devices.
- Due to limitations in FOTA Finder (§IV-B), we were unable to process 37% of the Firmware Scanner dataset.
- A larger coverage might change the distribution of FOTA types.
- We used static lists filled by manual web searches to classify companies based on package names, which may impact our results.

### VI. Behavior Analysis
We perform a static analysis of the FOTA apps in our dataset to characterize their capabilities, privacy risks, and potential for executing harmful or unwanted behaviors. We also analyze aspects relevant to the installation process and other artifacts present in both devices and FOTA apps, such as shared UIDs, to provide additional information about the stakeholders and their relationships. Our findings only show potential behaviors, as we do not have runtime observations. Code obfuscation techniques or reflection [35], [42], [54] may also lead to missing some behaviors, which is a known limitation of static analysis.

#### A. Overview
We begin with a general analysis of the DEX code of 1,716 non-Google FOTA apps found on non-rooted devices to identify potentially harmful behaviors, including access to sensitive resources and personal data. We use a custom analysis pipeline integrating multiple open-source static analysis tools, such as FlowDroid [31] and Amandroid [67] for taint analysis, and a modified version of Androwarn [10] for API usage analysis. Due to technical and instrumentation challenges, we are unable to dynamically study FOTA apps in a standard sandbox environment.

**Table III: Summary of Results**
We classify access to 36 different types of sensitive data, resources, or capabilities into 9 categories. The majority of FOTA apps show expected behaviors, such as accessing the current network and phone state. However, a prevalent access to user and device identifiers is observed. A small number (<5%) of FOTA apps access the device location. Table IV provides details on the types of device and user data accessed and uploaded to update servers. The purpose of uploading such identifiers is unknown, but it may facilitate targeted installation programs. Personal data is likely uploaded without user consent, indicating a lack of transparency. Other potentially dangerous behaviors include the ability to make phone calls (146 apps), record audio (44 apps), or capture video (40 apps). However, as we will further investigate in §VI-C, their usage is legitimate in most cases.

In the following sections, we delve deeper into these potentially dangerous behaviors, focusing on the presence of third-party components in FOTA apps and the types of permissions requested by FOTA apps. When relevant, we will contextualize our findings with the type of FOTA apps according to the classification in §V-A.
