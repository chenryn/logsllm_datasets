User: I have a web socket server running on an Ubuntu 12.04 EC2 Instance. My web socket server is written in Python, I am using Autobahn WebSockets.
I have a JavaScript client that uses WebRTC to capture webcam frames and send them to the web socket server.
My webserver (where the JavaScript is hosted) is not deployed on EC2. The python web socket server only do video frame processing and is running over TCP and port 9000.
My Problem:
The JS client can connect to the web socket and the server receives and processes the webcam frames. However, after 5 or 6 minutes the client stops sending the frames and displaying the following message:

WebSocket connection to 'ws://x.x.x.x:9000/' failed: Failed to send
  WebSocket frame.

When I print the error data I got "undefined".
Of course, this never happens when I run the server on my local testing environment.
Assistant: This could be caused by to a Chrome Extension.
