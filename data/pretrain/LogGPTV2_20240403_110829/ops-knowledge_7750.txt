User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Using PHPMailer on Hostgator (timeout when try to login into SMTP server) Solved: The problem was that to use the service through hostgator, for some reason the user must log in using main dsn name and not the SMTP domain name.

I was using the simple PHP mail() function to send emails and it was working fine but it didn't require to login into SMPT server. When I moved to PHPMailer library I wrote this code to send email but I'm having timeout when when trying to do this login. According to info from hostgator, the SMTP server (with SSL/TSL) is at port 465. So I wrote:

$mail = new PHPMailer;

$mail-&gt;SMTPDebug  = 3;
$mail-&gt;isSMTP();                                       // Set mailer to use SMTP
$mail-&gt;Host       = 'mail.mydomain.com';               // Specify main and backup SMTP servers
$mail-&gt;SMTPAuth   = true;                              // Enable SMTP authentication
$mail-&gt;Username   = 'contact@mydomain.com';            // SMTP username
$mail-&gt;Password   = 'pass';                            // SMTP password
$mail-&gt;SMTPSecure = 'tls';                             // Enable TLS encryption, `ssl` also accepted
$mail-&gt;Port       = 465;                               // TCP port to connect to
$mail-&gt;setFrom('contact@mydomain.com', 'my name');
$mail-&gt;addAddress('....@gmail.com', 'someone');        // Add a recipient

$mail-&gt;addReplyTo('contact@mydomain.com', 'my name');
$mail-&gt;isHTML(true);                                   // Set email format to HTML

$mail-&gt;Subject = 'subject';
$mail-&gt;Body    = 'msg body &lt;b&gt;bold!&lt;/b&gt;';
$mail-&gt;AltBody = 'Corpo alternativo caso o primeiro não seja exibido';

if(!$mail-&gt;send())
{
    echo 'Message could not be sent.';
    echo 'Mailer Error: ' . $mail-&gt;ErrorInfo;
}
else
{
    echo 'Message has been sent';
}


But when this php file is called, besides not showing the echo I placed before the code, it also waited the 300 seconds to open a modal warning me of the timeout error. Thanks in advance.

Assistant: I think the answer is in your code. You have lines like $mail-&gt;Host       = 'mail.mydomain.com'; Be sure to switch all these out with actual domains. You have to use your www.com website domain.

The following is wrong.

$mail-&gt;Host       = 'mail.mydomain.com';               // Specify main and backup SMTP servers


I'm not surprised it won't send. Swap all the values out with real strings that matter to your site.
