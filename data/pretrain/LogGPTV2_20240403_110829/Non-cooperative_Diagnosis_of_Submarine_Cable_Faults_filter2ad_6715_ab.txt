Fig. 3. Five sets of subpaths observed from the NOKIA, ENG3, and BBC paths
(response) packet is received by the destination, and the ﬁrst packet’s RTT can
be used to infer a congested router’s queueing delay upon packet loss on the
forward (reverse) path [13]. Moreover, P11s (R11s) on the x-axis in Fig. 2(b)
show the RTTs when both packets in a probe (response) pair are lost. We align
the x-axes in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) to facilitate a clear comparison.
Fig. 2(b) shows that UB(cid:2)BBC suﬀered from signiﬁcant congestion in phase
(b). We also observe similar results for the other BBC paths and the NOKIA
and ENG3 paths which are not shown in this paper. Comparing with phase (a),
phase (b) exhibits both RTT inﬂation and more loss pairs with the measured
path queueing delay [13] between 34 ms and 228 ms. In many cases, both packets
in a probe pair or a response pair were lost. The ﬁgure also shows a prolonged
congestion period in the forward path, indicated by persistent probe packet
losses. However, the path performance improved in the second half of the phase
which corresponds to the non-working hours in the United Kingdom.
Phases (c) and (d). Fig. 2(a) shows a further reduction of the IP-level Jaccard
distance for the ENG3 and BBC paths on 15 April 5:40 GMT (i.e., the onset of
phase (c)), because only the subpath via Alexandria and London was retained in
FLAG (as shown in Fig. 3(c)). Moreover, Fig. 2(b) shows more prolonged RTT
inﬂation and packet losses during phase (c), which was probably caused by the
reduced alternate routes.
On 16 April 7:30 GMT, the beginning of phase (d), the service provider for
UA–UH changed the upstream from FLAG to TATA (AS6453) only for the BBC
paths. As a result, the IP-level Jaccard distance shown in Fig. 2(a) dropped to
almost zero. We also observe a spike from the AS-level Jaccard distance for the
BBC paths at the similar time in Fig. 1(b). Notice that this change signiﬁcantly
improved the performance for the BBC paths. In particular, Fig. 2(b) shows that
UB(cid:2)BBC enjoyed relatively stable RTTs and insigniﬁcant packet losses (and
230
E.W.W. Chan et al.
similarly for the other BBC paths), whereas the NOKIA and ENG3 paths still
suﬀered from severe congestion in this phase.
Discussion. Fig. 4 shows all the submarine cables available to FLAG and TATA
for connecting the IP hops’ locations in Figs. 3(a)–3(d). We generate the ﬁgures
by inspecting the cables and landing points in the cable maps of FLAG [6] and
TATA [5]. Fig. 4(b) shows that TATA uses only the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable to
reach Singapore, Chennai, and Mumbai, but these segments were not aﬀected
by the shunt fault occurred in the Mediterranean segment [9]. Moreover, TATA
uses diﬀerent cables between Mumbai and London. On the other hand, Fig. 4(a)
shows that FLAG does not use the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable for forwarding traﬃc
from Hong Kong to the three web servers.
Based on Fig. 4, a plausible explanation for the congestion in the FLAG net-
work in phase (b) is taking on rerouted traﬃc from the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable after
the cable fault. Both FEA and SEA-ME-WE 4 (and SEA-ME-WE 3) are the
major submarine cables connecting between Europe and Asia. Fig. 4(b) shows
that TATA could use FEA to reach BBC when the SEA-ME-WE 4 segment
in the Mediterranean region was not available. Therefore, the congestion was
introduced as a secondary eﬀect of the cable fault. On the other hand, the path
quality for the BBC paths improved after switching to TATA in phase (d). Unlike
FLAG, TATA has access to three submarine cables between Suez and Alexan-
dria. There are also two cables between Alexandria and London. Moreover, the
reduced path diversity from phase (a) to phase (c) could also be responsible for
the congestion in the FLAG network, although the reason for the reduction is
unknown to us.

3.2 Impacts of the Cable Repair
In this section, we analyze the impact of the four-day (25–28 April 2010) repair
of the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable on the routing behavior and path performance.
Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) show the respective time series of the average IP-level Jaccard
distance (at the top of each ﬁgure) for the ENG3 and BBC paths and the RTTs
Non-cooperative Diagnosis of Submarine Cable Faults

for UB(cid:2)ENG3 and UB(cid:2)BBC between 23–30 April which is labeled as the
second episode (e2) in Fig. 1(a). We do not include the time series for the NOKIA
paths, because they are similar to ENG3’s. Moreover, the path performance for
the other measuring nodes to ENG3 (BBC) also resembles the performance given
in Fig. 5(a) (5(b)). To correlate the forward-path routing behavior with the path
performance, each ﬁgure only shows the loss pairs and both-packet-loss events
(i.e., P01 and P11) observed from the forward paths. Note that the ENG3 paths
remained in phase (c) during the entire period, whereas the BBC paths switched
from phase (d) to phase (e), which involves a signiﬁcant route change, and then
back to phase (d).

Fig. 5. Time series of the average IP-level Jaccard distance for the paths to ENG3 and
BBC, and the time series of RTT for UB(cid:2)ENG3 and UB(cid:2)BBC during e2.
Fig. 5(a) shows that the ENG3 (and also NOKIA) paths suﬀered from diurnal
congestion in e2. Traceroutes show that the NOKIA and ENG3 paths still went
through the FLAG subpaths shown in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c), respectively, for the
entire episode. As a result, both the RTT and Jaccard distance time series exhibit
similar patterns as in phases (b)–(c) of Fig. 2. The paths also encountered more
severe congestion since 25 April when the SEA-ME-WE 4 cable’s repair process
began. It is thus likely that the FLAG subpaths were further utilized by other
232
E.W.W. Chan et al.
aﬀected parties as alternate routes during the repair process. However, FLAG’s
network operators did not seem to respond to the degraded path performance
until they switched to eastbound routes on 5 May noon GMT (which is shown
in Fig. 1(a)), and the path performance was subsequently improved.
Fig. 5(b), on the other hand, shows that the BBC paths were quite good
during e2 except for sporadic packet losses and routing instability. In particu-
lar, at the beginning of the episode, the paths still went through TATA which
routed the BBC traﬃc via the subpath given in Fig. 3(d). Probably due to the
interruption caused by the repair work [2], TATA rerouted the traﬃc to another
set of subpaths with longer RTTs on 25 April 13:30 GMT, and we refer to this
period as phase (e). We can also see a positive correlation between ﬂuctuation in
the IP-level Jaccard distance and signiﬁcant forward-path packet losses during
phase (e). TATA ﬁnally restored the subpath in Fig. 3(d) on 29 April 6:00 GMT
(which is close to the completion time of the repair), and therefore the path
performance returned to the level observed from the beginning of the episode.
4 Related Work
RIPE NCC [10] reported a longitudinal study of cable cuts in the Mediterranean
in 2008 based on its routing information (RIS), test traﬃc measurements (TTM),
and DNS monitoring (DNSMON) services. The study showed that the aﬀected
networks involved frequent rerouting in BGP, signiﬁcant network congestion, and
increased latencies. In our study, we mainly use end-to-end path measurement
and IP traceroute to study the impacts on the paths under our monitoring.
Based on a set of measuring points, we are able to infer that the path congestion
was due to the secondary eﬀect of the cable fault, which has not been reported
in previous studies.
Renesys [7] also reported a few studies on the impacts of submarine cable
faults based on BGP routes and RTTs (measured by traceroute) obtained from
its data collection infrastructure. Comparing with their analysis on the same
SEA-ME-WE 4 cable fault [12], our methodology uses TCP data packets to
measure the data-path performance, instead of ICMP packets that can be pro-
cessed by diﬀerent paths in the routers and thus produce biased measurement.
Therefore, our measurement observed quite stable RTTs for the paths via the
TATA network, whereas Renesys observed signiﬁcant RTT ﬂuctuation from the
TATA network in the similar time period. Besides, our analysis also obtains
useful packet loss information that was not considered in their analysis.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we employed non-cooperative path measurement to study the
impacts of a recent submarine cable fault on the Internet connectivity and end-
to-end path performance. With only eight measurement nodes, we showed that
the non-cooperative methods (HTTP/OneProbe and traceroute) could facilitate
an in-depth impact analysis of a cable fault occurred thousands miles away. In
particular, our analysis revealed that a cable fault could signiﬁcantly impact on
Non-cooperative Diagnosis of Submarine Cable Faults
233
Internet traﬃc on other non-faulty paths. Moreover, network operators did not
always take immediate action to resolve the performance degradation problem
as a result of the cable fault.
As an ongoing work, we will report our impact analysis of other submarine
cable faults, such as a SEACOM cable fault in Africa in July 2010. We will also
devise new algorithms based on non-cooperative path measurement to promptly
identify and respond to path-quality degradation as a result of cable faults.
