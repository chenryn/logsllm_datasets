### Overview of Steganography Techniques and Tools

#### LSB (Least Significant Bit) Substitution
- **Concept**: Embed a secret message in the least significant bits (LSBs) of image pixels.
- **Principle**: The human visual system is not sensitive enough to detect minor changes in color.
- **Basic Algorithm**:
  - Take the first M cover pixels, where M is the length of the secret message in bits.
  - Replace the last bit of each pixel with a bit from the message.
- **Challenge**: The first region of the image may have different statistical properties compared to the rest.
- **Improvement**: Use a pseudo-random number generator to distribute the message bits more evenly.

**Example**:
- **Original Data**:
  - 10010101 00001101 11001001
  - 10010110 00001111 11001011
  - 10011111 00010000 11001011
- **Stego Data**:
  - 10010100 00001101 11001000
  - 10010110 00001110 11001011
  - 10011111 00010001 11001011

#### Steganography Tools

**S-Tools**
- **Functionality**: Hides information inside BMP, GIF, or WAV files using LSB overwriting.
- **Features**:
  - Uses a password for LSB randomization and encryption.
  - Converts 8-bit images to 24-bit and reduces colors in 24-bit images.
  - Can hide multiple files within a single image or sound file.
  - Supports multiple algorithms.

**JPHS**
- **Functionality**: Hides information inside JPG files using LSB overwriting of DCT coefficients.
- **Features**:
  - No installation required; uses JPHIDE and JPSEEK.
  - Minimizes visual and statistical effects by distributing the hidden file.
  - Uses Blowfish for encryption and LSB randomization.
  - Available for Linux and Windows.

**MP3 Stego**
- **Functionality**: Compresses, encrypts, and hides data in MP3 bit streams.
- **Features**:
  - Available for Linux.
  - Can be used as a copyright marking system.
  - Hidden data can be removed by recompressing the bit stream, but at the cost of quality loss.
  - Requires a text file and a WAV file to produce an MP3 file.

**Camouflage**
- **Functionality**: Hides files by scrambling them and attaching them to another file.
- **Features**:
  - Appends hidden files to carrier files.
  - Password-protects camouflaged files.
  - Can nest camouflaged files within other camouflaged files.

**Stego (for Mac)**
- **Functionality**: Embeds and retrieves data from Macintosh PICT format files without changing appearance or size.
- **Features**:
  - Alters pixel values slightly.
  - Rasterizes the image and embeds data into the LSBs of RGB or indexed color values.
  - Hides the file length in the LSBs of the first 32 steggable bytes.

**NCovert**
- **Functionality**: Functions as a TCP covert channel.
- **Features**:
  - Runs on Linux.
  - Transfers data using the IP ID field and TCP sequence number.
  - Acts as both client and server based on options.

**Hydan**
- **Functionality**: Hides data in Windows or Linux binary (executable) files.
- **Features**:
  - Takes advantage of redundancies in i386 assembler.
  - Can hide one byte in approximately 110 instruction bytes.
  - Maintains the size of the carrier file.

**StegFS**
- **Functionality**: A hidden file system for Linux.
- **Features**:
  - Places hidden files into unused blocks of a partition.
  - Uses a separate block allocation table with 128-bit encrypted entries.
  - Encrypted entries are indistinguishable from random bits without the key.

### Detecting Steganography Use

### Steganography Uses
- Hiding/sharing codes or sensitive information.
- Concealing personal or embarrassing images.
- Sharing illegal content, plans, or source code.
- Hiding cracks, serials, passwords, and backdoors.

### Physical Hiding and Sharing Secrets

**Spy Tactics/Practices**
- **Copying Secrets**: Make surreptitious copies instead of stealing.
- **Two-Way Communication**: Establish creative communication methods.
- **Dead Drops**: Exchange secrets without meeting.
- **Creative Envelopes**: Use common areas and items for concealment.
- **Caching**: Balance accessibility with secrecy.
- **Booby-Trapped Containers**: Use 30 unique forms/categories of concealment.
- **Destroy Obsolete Records**: Dispose of old records, receipts, tools, maps, and passwords.

**Two-Way Communication**
- **Signals**: Indicate that a drop has been made.
- **Separate Signals**: Indicate that payment or trade items have been left.
- **Strategically Placed Items**: Drink cans, broken tree branches, Christmas lights, chalk marks, etc.

**Secret “Envelopes”**
- **Imagination-Limited**: Hide secrets in various everyday objects and locations.
- **Examples**:
  - Inside smoke detectors, books, under desks, electrical outlets, tissue boxes.
  - Inside electronic devices, behind wall plates, in cat litter boxes, false bottom containers.
  - Inside dog food bags, car parts, junk mail envelopes, gutted VHS tapes, buried, etc.

**Dead Drop Uses**
- **Illegal Exchanges**: Drug deals, classified information, corporate espionage, bio/nuclear weapons, stolen goods.
- **Virus Exchange**: Diskettes with viruses.
- **Imagination-Limited**: Various other uses.
