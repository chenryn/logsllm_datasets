Question: "In a code review session, a developer claims that their code is secure because they have applied a check for NULL pointers at every usage point. As a security analyst, you need to provide a counterargument that addresses potential issues this approach might fail to mitigate. Which of the following would be the most effective counterargument?"
 "A": "While checking pointers before use mitigates the risk, potential race conditions could still lead to a NULL pointer dereference in a multithreaded environment."
 "B": "Checking pointers before use is ineffective, and it is better to rely on tools that prevent the use of uninitialized variables instead."
 "C": "Input validation on external data is unnecessary if all pointers are checked for NULL because it would not impact the dereference."
 "D": "The use of automated static analysis tools during the testing phase is the only way to ensure that NULL pointer dereferences do not occur."
Answer: A
