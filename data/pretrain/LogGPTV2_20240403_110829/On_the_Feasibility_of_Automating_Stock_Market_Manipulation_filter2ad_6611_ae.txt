A APPENDIX
Layering is tricky to grasp because of the indirect way pressure
from open orders drives stock prices. To help visualize it, we list the
non-bona fide trades made in one real-world instance in Table 8. As
shown, even though only half the orders actually executed (the rest
were cancelled by the criminals), the stock price moved 0.66% in a
matter of minutes. If, for example, the criminal bought $1,000 worth
of shares prior to this manipulation, he could sell them immediately
following the layering for $1006.60. While this gain may seem
small, with enough leverage (i.e., shares bought in advance) and
consistency, criminals can turn even this seemingly indiscernible
movement into a profitable scam.

ACSAC 2020, December 7–11, 2020, Austin, USA
Table 8: One instance of non-bona fide orders reported in
SEC v.s. Taub et al. In a few minutes, the criminal increased
the stock’s price by 0.66%, despite most of the orders being
canceled. By following these orders with a bona fide ask, the
adversary can cash out any shares he purchased in advance
at the elevated price.
