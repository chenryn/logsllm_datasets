### Appendix

#### Understanding Layering
Layering is a complex manipulation technique because it indirectly influences stock prices through open orders. To illustrate, Table 8 lists non-bona fide trades in a real-world instance. Even though only half of the orders were executed (the rest were canceled by the criminals), the stock price increased by 0.66% in a matter of minutes. If a criminal bought $1,000 worth of shares before this manipulation, they could sell them immediately after for $1,006.60. Although this gain may seem small, with sufficient leverage and consistency, such movements can be turned into a profitable scam.

| **Order Type** | **# Shares** | **Price** | **Capital Needed** | **# Executed** |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| Buy            | 500          | $69.48    | $34,740            | 0              |
| Buy            | 100          | $69.68    | $6,968             | 100            |
| ...            | ...          | ...       | ...                | ...            |
| Total          | 2,600        |           | $184,066           | 1,100          |

#### Simplified Notation
To simplify the following tables, we use the notation (b, s, x) to denote buying x shares at price b and selling them at price s.
