### Supporting Windows Clients

Mac OS X Server supports the native Windows file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB). SMB is also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS). Mac OS X Server comes with built-in browsing and name resolution services for your Windows client computers. You can enable Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) on your server, or you can register with an existing WINS server.

Windows services in Mac OS X Server include Windows Master Browser and Domain Master Browser services. You do not need a Windows server or a primary domain controller on your network to allow Windows users to see your server listed in the Network Neighborhood window. Enable the master browsers to allow Windows clients outside of your server’s subnet to access the server by name.

You can also set up your Mac OS X server to be a Primary Domain Controller for your Windows clients.

#### TCP/IP
In order to have access to Windows services, Windows client computers must be properly configured to connect over TCP/IP. Refer to your Windows networking documentation for information on TCP/IP configuration.

### Connecting to the Server Using Network Neighborhood

Before trying to connect to the server from a Windows client computer, find out the workgroup or domain of both the client computer and the file server.

You can find the workgroup name of a Windows client computer in the computer’s Network Neighborhood window. To find the server’s workgroup name, open Server Admin, click **Windows** in the **Computers & Services** list, click **Settings**, then click **General**.

#### To connect to a Windows server using the Network Neighborhood:
1. On the Windows client computer, open the **Network Neighborhood** window. If you are in the same workgroup or domain as the server, skip to step 4.
2. Double-click the **Entire Network** icon.
3. Double-click the icon of the workgroup or domain the server is located in.
4. Double-click the server’s icon.
5. Log in using your Windows login name.

#### Connecting to the Server by Name or Address in Windows
You can connect to the Windows server by double-clicking its name in the Network Neighborhood. You can also connect without using the Network Neighborhood.

#### To connect to the Windows server without the Network Neighborhood:

### Chapter 5: NFS Service

This chapter shows how to set up and manage the NFS file service in Mac OS X Server.

#### Overview
Network File System (NFS) is the protocol used for file services on UNIX computers. Use NFS to provide file service for your UNIX clients (other than Mac OS X clients). You can export a shared item to a set of client computers or to "World." Exporting an NFS volume to World means that anyone who can access your server can also access that volume.

**Note:** The NFS term for sharing is "export." This guide, therefore, uses that term to be consistent with standard NFS terminology.

You use Server Admin to configure and manage NFS service. You also use the Sharing module of Workgroup Manager to set privileges and access levels for the share points or folders you want to export.

---

### Before You Set Up NFS Service

Be sure to consider the security implications of exporting in NFS before you set up NFS service.

#### Security Considerations
NFS was created for a secure networking environment, in which you can trust the client computer users and the people who administer the clients. Whereas access to Apple file service, Windows file sharing, and FTP service share points is controlled by authentication (user name and password), access to NFS shared items is controlled by the client software and file permissions.

NFS allows access to information based on the computer’s IP address. This means that a particular client computer will have access to certain share points regardless of who is using the computer. Whenever that computer is started up, some volumes or folders are automatically mounted or made available, and anyone using that computer can access those volumes or folders.

With NFS, it’s possible for a user to spoof ownership of another person’s files. For example, if a file on the server is owned by a user with user ID 1234, and you export a folder that contains that file, someone on a remote computer can create a local user on the remote computer, give it a user ID of 1234, mount that folder, and have the same access to the folder’s contents as the file’s original owner.

You can take some steps to prevent this by creating unique user IDs and by safeguarding user information. If you have Internet access and plan to export to World, your server should be behind a firewall.

---

### Setup Overview

Here is an overview of the major steps for setting up NFS service.

1. **Before You Begin**
   - Read “Before You Set Up NFS Service” for issues to consider when setting up NFS service.
2. **Configure NFS settings**
   - The NFS settings let you set the maximum number of daemons and choose how you want to serve clients—via TCP, UDP, or both. See “Configuring NFS Settings.”
3. **Create share points and share them using NFS**
   - Use the Sharing module of Workgroup Manager to specify the share points you want to export (share) using NFS. You must explicitly configure a share point to use NFS for NFS users to be able to access the share point. See “Creating a Share Point and Setting Privileges,” “Setting Up an NFS Share Point,” and “Automatically Mounting Share Points for Clients.”

You don’t need to start or stop NFS service; when you export a share point, the service starts automatically. When you delete all exports, the service stops. To see if NFS service is running, open Server Admin, select **NFS** in the **Computers & Services** list, and click **Overview**.

### Setting Up NFS Service

You can use Server Admin to change some NFS service settings.

#### Configuring NFS Settings
The NFS settings let you set the maximum number of daemons and choose how you want to serve clients—via TCP, UDP, or both.

#### To configure NFS settings:
1. Open Server Admin and select **NFS** in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings** (near the bottom of the window).
3. Enter a number in the **Use__server daemons** field to specify the maximum number of `nfsd` daemons you want to allow to run at one time.
   - An `nfsd` daemon is a server process that runs continuously and processes reading and writing requests from clients. The more daemons that are available, the more concurrent clients can be served. Typically, four to six daemons are adequate to handle the level of concurrent requests.
4. Choose how you want to serve data to your client computers.
   - Select both TCP and UDP unless you have a specific performance concern. TCP provides better performance for clients, and UDP puts a smaller load on the server.
     - **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: Separates data into packets and uses error correction to ensure proper transmission.
     - **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: Does not break data into packets, so it uses fewer system resources. It is more scalable than TCP and a good choice for a heavily used server. Do not use UDP if remote clients are using the service.
5. Click **Save**.

#### From the Command Line
You can also change the NFS service settings using the `serveradmin` command in Terminal. For more information, refer to the "File Services" chapter of the command-line administration guide.

### Managing NFS Service

This section tells you how to perform day-to-day management tasks for NFS service once you have it up and running.

#### Starting and Stopping NFS Service
When the server starts up, a startup script checks to see if any NFS exports are defined; if so, NFS starts automatically.

If NFS is not running and you add exports, wait a few seconds for the service to launch.

To stop NFS service:
- Delete all exports. The `nfsd` daemons continue to run until the server is restarted.

#### From the Command Line
You can also stop the NFS service processes using the `kill` command in Terminal. For more information, refer to the "File Services" chapter of the command-line administration guide.

#### Viewing NFS Service Status
You use Server Status to check the status of all Mac OS X Server devices and services.

#### To view NFS service status:
1. Open Server Admin and select **NFS** in the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Overview** (near the bottom of the window).
3. The **Overview** pane tells you whether the service is running and if `mountd`, `nfsd`, and `portmap` processes are running.
   - **mountd**: Handles mount requests from client computers (only one `mountd` process will appear in the status window if you’ve defined any exports).
   - **nfsd**: Responds to read/write requests from client computers that have mounted folders.
   - **portmap**: Allows client computers to find `nfs` daemons (always one process).

#### From the Command Line
You can also check the NFS service status using the `ps` or `serveradmin` commands in Terminal. For more information, refer to the "File Services" chapter of the command-line administration guide.

---

### Viewing Current NFS Exports

You can use the Terminal application to view a list of the current NFS exports.

#### To view current NFS exports:
- In Terminal, type `showmount -e`.
- If this command does not return results within a few seconds, there are no exports, and the process is blocked (hung). Press `Control-C` to exit the `showmount` command and return to an active command line in your Terminal window.

### Chapter 6: FTP Service

This chapter shows how to set up and manage File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service in Mac OS X Server.

#### Overview
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a simple way for computers of any type to transfer files over the Internet. Someone using any computer that supports FTP or an FTP client application can connect to your FTP server and upload or download files (depending on the permissions you set). Most Internet browsers and a number of freeware and shareware applications can be used to access your FTP server.

FTP service in Mac OS X Server is based on the source code for Washington University’s FTP server, known as "wu-FTPd." However, the original source code has been extensively modified to provide a better user experience. Some of these differences are described in the following sections.

#### A Secure FTP Environment
Most FTP servers restrict users to specific directories on the server. Users can see folders and files only in these directories, so the server is kept quite secure. Users cannot access volumes mounted outside the restricted directories, and symbolic links and other mechanisms are typically disabled to prevent unauthorized access.
