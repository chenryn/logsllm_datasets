5 Countermeasures
In this section we present two countermeasures against
the attacks we developed. Speciﬁcally, we propose dif-
ferent approaches to resolve both problems. A solution
is required to not only ﬁx the denial of service issue, but
at the same time the MT service hijacking. Unlike the
second prevention strategy, the ﬁrst solution solves both
issues at once, but requires a protocol change.
For the ﬁrst solution, we propose a change to the
paging protocol procedure [4]. To perform authentica-
tion, the network is sending a 128 bit random challenge
(RAND) to the subscriber. Based on the secret key Ki
that is only stored on the SIM card or in the authenti-
cation center of the network, the subscriber computes a
32 bit response value using the A3 algorithm. The so-
called Signed Response (SRES) value is sent back to the
USENIX Association  
22nd USENIX Security Symposium  45
network. In the same fashion, the operator network com-
putes SRES based on Ki as stored in the authentication
center. If both SRES values match, the subscriber suc-
cessfully authenticated itself to the network. However,
as mandated in the GSM speciﬁcation, the authentica-
tion is performed after the paging response is processed.
The same principle applies to UMTS [12]. Therefore,
the paging response itself is not authenticated. By adapt-
ing the protocol to include the RAND value in the pag-
ing request and SRES in the paging response, this can
be changed. This implies that all of the paging responses
are authenticated, which eliminates session hijacking. At
the same time a paging response that includes authenti-
cation information can be used by the network to validate
the response before changing the state to not expect fur-
ther paging responses. Thus, also solving the denial of
service attack. It is important to note that this requires
a fresh RAND for every authentication to prevent replay
attacks. This is similar to the protocol change proposed
by Arapinis et al. [16], which encrypts the paging request
using a shared session key called unlikability key. While
they use this key to prevent tracking of subscribers via
IMSI paging, the same modiﬁcation also prevents our
described attacks. Unfortunately, partly due to the dif-
ﬁculty of updating devices in the ﬁeld, the industry is
reluctant to apply new protocol changes to commercially
deployed networks.
The second solution involves no protocol change, but
has to dismantle each problem individually. MT session
hijacking issue can be addressed, by enforcing authen-
tication for each service request. This would also over-
come MO session hijacking. In order to eliminate the de-
nial of service attack, the MSC/VLR state machine needs
to be changed. Speciﬁcally, the MSC/VLR has to be able
to map all incoming paging responses to the correct ser-
vice as long as no fully authenticated session exists. Ac-
cordingly, this circumvents the denial of service attack.
6 Related Work
In the last years, various attacks against cellular networks
and their protocol stacks have been published. We sep-
arate related work into two parts. First, attacks that al-
low an adversary to impersonate a victim. Second, de-
nial of service attacks in mobile networks that result in
customers not being able to receive MT services.
Impersonation. In [28] Nohl and Melette demonstrated
that it is possible to impersonate a subscriber for mo-
bile originated services. By ﬁrst snifﬁng a transaction
over-the-air, cracking the session key Kc, and knowing a
victims TMSI, they were able to place a phone call on
behalf of a victim. The authors of [24] used a femtocell
device under their control in order to impersonate a sub-
scriber that is currently booked into the femtocell. By
relaying authentication challenges to a victim, they were
able to send SMS messages on behalf of the subscriber.
Our work in this paper is different, as we do not attack
MO services, but MT services. Thus, in our research,
the considered victim is, e.g., the called party and not the
caller. Contrary to attacking MO services, attacking MT
services is time critical.
Denial of Service. We consider relevant types of de-
nial of service attacks in mobile networks that affect MT
services for subscribers. We determined three types of
denial of service attacks that fulﬁll this requirement: at-
tacks directly targeting the victim phone, attacks focus-
ing on the network, and attacks affecting subscribers, but
without direct communication.
The ﬁrst type comprises DoS attacks that target mo-
bile devices directly, most notably phones. These issues
are usually baseband/phone speciﬁc and caused by im-
plementation ﬂaws. Several vulnerabilities have been
discovered in mobile phones that can lead to code ex-
ecution and denial of service conditions [33, 46]. Par-
ticularly, the Curse-of-Silence ﬂaw enabled an adversary
to disable the MT SMS functionality of speciﬁc Nokia
devices [44].
In [38] Racic et al. demonstrate that it
is possible to stealthily exhaust mobile phone batteries
by repeatedly sending crafted MMS messages to a vic-
tim. Consequently, the phone battery will drain very fast,
eventually the phone will switch off, and MT services
can no longer be delivered to a victim. Our attack is in-
herently different from these kinds of attacks, because it
is independent from the target device type and does not
interact with the victim directly at all.
The second category consists of attacks that target the
operator itself, and as a consequence also impact MT ser-
vices for subscribers. These types are caused by design
ﬂaws. Spaar showed in [43] that it is feasible to exhaust
channel resources of a base station by continuously re-
questing new channels on the RACH. Unlike our attack,
this attack is limited to a single BTS and does not af-
fect subscribers served by a different cell. Therefore, to
attack a metropolitan area, an attacker needs to commu-
nicate with and attack every BTS in that area. Enck et
al. [21] showed that it is practical to deny voice or SMS
services within a speciﬁc geographical area, by sending
a large number of short messages to subscribers in that
area. Serror et al. [42] exhibit that similar conditions
can be achieved in CDMA2000 networks by causing a
signiﬁcant paging load and delay of paging messages
via Internet originating packets to phones. A compara-
ble resource consumption attack for 3G/WiMax has been
demonstrated by Lee et al. in [32]. As Traynor et al. out-
line [36], it is also possible to degrade the performance
of large networks by utilizing a phone botnet and, e.g.,
repeatedly adding and deleting call forwarding settings.
All of these attacks exhaust network resources mostly
46  22nd USENIX Security Symposium

due to generated signaling load. As a result, services can
no longer be reliably offered to mobile subscribers, effec-
tively causing denial of service conditions. This includes
MT and MO services. We exploit a race condition in the
MT paging procedure and do not attack the core network
itself. Our attack does not intend to generate excessive
signaling trafﬁc in the network. As a result, it is not pre-
vented by proposed mitigations for these kind of issues
from previous research.
Our attack ﬁts into the last of the three types of attacks
that result in DoS for MT services. Most network attacks
aim to abuse generated signaling to decrease the over-
all performance of the operator network. Attacks against
mobile devices merely use the network as a bearer to de-
liver a speciﬁc payload to the phone. The third category
is stipulated by attacks that target the mobile device it-
self, but do not send any payload to it. The aforemen-
tioned IMSI detach attack discovered by Munaut [34]
can effectively cause that a service such as a call, will
not result in paging requests by the network anymore.
As described in section 4.4, this design ﬂaw even sup-
ports our attack. Contrary to this vulnerability, the pag-
ing response attack allows us to precisely control when
and where a victim can be reached or not. After sending
a detach indication, an attacker cannot control anymore
for how long this state is kept.
Our approach can be used either to hijack a session
or to perform a denial of service attacks. We do attack
mobile stations but neither by exhausting network re-
sources, nor by directly communicating to the target de-
vice. We can target speciﬁc geographical areas, speciﬁc
subscribers or a group of subscribers without the need to
build a hit list of phone numbers residing in that area. De-
pending on the target, the attack can be either distributed
or performed from a single phone. Additionally, the in-
volved costs for this attack are as cheap as acquiring the
required number of Motorola C1XX phones.
7 Conclusion
The trust in the security of cellular networks and specif-
ically the widely used GSM standard has been shat-
tered several times. Yet, attacks against mobile termi-
nated services are a minority. The undisturbed operation
of telecommunication networks is traditionally based on
trust. The inherent trust that each subscriber and par-
ticipant in communication plays by the rules. Nonethe-
less, due to several available and modiﬁable software and
hardware projects for telecommunication, this trust rela-
tionship has to be considered broken. In this paper we
showed how to exploit the trust in paging procedures on
a broadcast medium. We demonstrated that it is possible
to leverage a race condition in the paging protocol to a
novel denial of service attack and the possibility to hi-
jack mobile terminated services in GSM. Moreover, we
showed that this attack can not only disturb communi-
cation for single subscribers, but can also greatly affect
telephony in a larger geographical region formed by lo-
cation areas. A motivated attacker can interrupt com-
munication on a large scale by merely utilizing a set of
inexpensive consumer devices that are available on the
market. This is considerably more efﬁcient compared
to traditional radio jamming due to the broad frequency
range of mobile carrier networks and the size of location
areas. In order to mitigate these attacks, we propose two
different countermeasures of which one does not require
a protocol change. We strongly encourage future stan-
dards to consider threats caused by active attackers that
tamper with user equipment and protocol stacks.
