User: I'm trying to add a python egg to my eclipse pydev path via Eclipse Settings -> PyDev -> Interpreter - Python -> New Egg/Zip(s), and in the dialog where I browse to the egg file, and click the "open" button on the dialog, it simply keeps the dialog open and browses into the egg.
This is on OS X with Helios SR 2.
Assistant: Go to:
Window > Preferences > PyDev > Interpreter - (Python, Iron python, or Jython) > Libraries
You can add a new folder, using the New folder Button,
You can add a new egg, using the New Egg button,
or remove.
If you are experimenting with new versions of libraries, I suggest to remove the old versions, restart eclipse, install the new ones, then restart eclipse again.
Cheers !! happy PyDeving !!
