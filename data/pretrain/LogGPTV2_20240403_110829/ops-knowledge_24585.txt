**User:**
I am trying to add a Python egg to my Eclipse PyDev path via *Eclipse Settings* -> *PyDev* -> *Interpreter - Python* -> *New Egg/Zip(s)*. However, when I browse to the egg file and click the "Open" button in the dialog, it simply keeps the dialog open and navigates into the egg file. This is happening on macOS with Helios SR 2.

**Assistant:**
To add a Python egg to your PyDev interpreter in Eclipse, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Window** > **Preferences**.
2. Navigate to **PyDev** > **Interpreters** > **Python Interpreter** (or **IronPython** or **Jython**, depending on your setup).
3. In the **Libraries** tab, you will find several options:
   - **New Folder**: Use this button to add a new folder containing your libraries.
   - **New Egg**: Use this button to add a new egg file.
   - **Remove**: Use this button to remove any existing libraries or eggs.

If you are experimenting with new versions of libraries, I recommend the following steps:
1. Remove the old versions of the libraries.
2. Restart Eclipse.
3. Add the new versions of the libraries.
4. Restart Eclipse again to ensure the changes take effect.

This should resolve the issue you are experiencing. Happy coding with PyDev! ðŸŽ‰
