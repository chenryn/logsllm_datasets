Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

Today, I updated Symfony by running the following command:
```bash
$ bin/vendors update
```
After the update, I attempted to clear the cache using:
```bash
$ php app/console cache:clear
```
However, I encountered the following error:
```
Catchable fatal error: Object of class Symfony\Component\ClassLoader\DebugUniversalClassLoader could not be converted to string in E:\Projetos\eMarketing\vendor\symfony\src\Symfony\Component\ClassLoader\DebugUniversalClassLoader.php on line 42.
```

This version is clearer, more structured, and easier to read.
