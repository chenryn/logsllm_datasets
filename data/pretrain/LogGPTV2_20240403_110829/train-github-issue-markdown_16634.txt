Hi!
I'm trying to prepare dataset splits for a problem I'm working on, and would
ultimately like a hybrid of Stratified K-Fold and Grouped K-Fold. Is there a
way to accomplish this using logic already built into sklearn? If not, where
would be the right place for me to add it/do you have any suggestions for how
to get started before I give it a go?
For a bit more context, my dataset is a considerably larger version of the
following structure:
    groups = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]  # you can think of this as a sample-id
    y = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]  # this is some trait of the samples 
The objective would be to balance `y` across the train and test sets, and have
each `group` only represented on one side of the folds. Thanks in advance!
