APPENDIX A
ALGORITHM PARAMETERS
In Section IV, we introduced Algorithm 1 to generate the
IRS conﬁgurations for IRShield. Here we provide additional
details on the algorithm parametrization.
Progression rate R. The progression rate R affects the
decorrelation speed of IRS conﬁgurations. In particular, R
determines the number of randomly selected IRS elements
(cid:100)R · M(cid:101) which are ﬂipped within the algorithm’s randomiza-
tion step. Therefore, R ∈ [0, 0.5]. For various values of R,
we simulate ensembles of IRS conﬁgurations over time with
Phold = 0, M = 256 IRS elements, and an update rate
of 20 conﬁgurations/sec. In Fig. 15, we plot
the average
Hamming distance over time to the initial conﬁguration at
t = 0. For the sake of simplicity,
the upper plot shows
the behavior of Algorithm 1 with the inversion step being
disabled (having no effect). The lower plot is obtained using
the unmodiﬁed algorithm.
channel. On the other hand, changing many IRS elements,
e. g., 50 %, is likely to result in a larger change. Thus, we
expect that reducing R increases the smoothness of the time
series of IRS channels. To experimentally assess this effect,
we collect Wi-Fi CSI measurements using the setup described
in Section III-C. We place the IRS at a distance of 30 cm
to the anchor and vary R. Similar to the simulation, we
use Phold = 0, M = 256 IRS elements, and an update
rate of 20 conﬁgurations/sec. We plot the amplitude of a
single OFDM subcarrier over time for exemplary values of
R with (Fig. 16) and without (Fig. 17) the inversion step of
Algorithm 1 being bypassed. From both ﬁgures, we can see the
algorithm’s desired to effect to vary the IRS signal amplitude
over time. As expected, it is evident that R controls the speed
of these variations. Apart from R, the effect of the inversion
step can be observed in Fig. 17, laying the foundation for an
enhanced sliding standard deviation.

and 1 s sliding-window standard deviation for various values of R. The
inversion step of Algorithm 1 is bypassed.
Fig. 15. Average Hamming distances of IRS conﬁgurations w.r.t. t = 0,
without (top) and with (bottom) inversion step.
Since the channel via the IRS, HIRS(k, t), is a function
of the IRS conﬁguration, R directly affects the decorrelation
speed of the time series of IRS channels. Intuitively, a change
of few IRS elements, e. g., 5 %, yields a small change in the

R should be chosen low enough such that strong IRS
amplitudes persist during the adversary’s sliding standard devi-
ation window to create excursions within ¯σ(w)(t). Conversely,
when the IRS changes too fast, single strong IRS amplitude
deviations will have less impact on ¯σ(w)(t). This can be

Hold probability Phold. In the previous paragraph, we consid-
ered Algorithm 1 with Phold = 0. In this case, the algorithm is
strictly scheduled according to the IRS refresh rate which we
set to 20 conﬁgurations/sec. With Phold > 0, the algorithm
is halted in a probabilistic manner, randomizing the timing
of the state transitions and scaling the average IRS refresh
rate by the factor Phold. In turn, short pauses are inserted
into the IRS operation, such that ¯σ(w)(t) covers a wider
range. To investigate the effect, we use the experimental setup
outlined in the previous paragraph and collect Wi-Fi CSI
measurements for R = 0.05 and varying values of Phold. We
plot the amplitude of a single OFDM subcarrier and the sliding
standard deviation over time in Fig. 18. From the bottom plot,
showing Phold = 0.6, we can clearly see that the timing of
the IRS-induced channel variation becomes increasingly non-
uniform.
of ¯σ(w)(t) are maximized while the coherence time lies within
the desired range of approx. 1 to 2 s.

Choice of parameters. Having outlined the effect of R and
Phold, we next seek to determine values for R and Phold.
Based on the considerations from Section IV-A, we use the
following metrics to assess the algorithm parametrization:

SYSTEMATIC COVERAGE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
APPENDIX B
The experimental setup for the systematic coverage tests as
described in Section V-B is depicted in Fig. 21.
• IRShield should disturb the adversary’s reference mea-
surement to yield an overly high motion detection thresh-
old, cf. Eq. (6). Thus, the median and MAD of ¯σ(w)(t)
should be maximized.
• IRShield should produce strong time-varying ﬂuctuations
within the adversarial observation. Thus, the signal en-
ergy (the Euclidean norm) of ¯σ(w)(t) should be maxi-
mized.
• The adversarial observation with IRShield should exhibit
temporal characteristics similar to actual human motion,
cf. Fig. 4, where strong signal variation occurs for du-
rations of 1 – 2 s. We assess the decorrelation speed by
means of the coherence time of ¯σ(w)(t) as the time its
normalized autocorrelation lies above 0.5.
As we can see from Figs. 19 and 20, Phold should be at least
0.4, while R should be between 0.025 and 0.05. Thereby, the
adversarial motion detection threshold and the Euclidean norm
