User: Please design a monitoring system that can monitor the running status of the server in real time and conduct remote monitoring through the mobile APP.
Assistant: The following is a possible monitoring system design for reference only: 1. Server monitor: software installed on the server to collect information such as server running status and resource usage, and send the data to the monitoring system server. You can choose mature monitoring software, such as zabbix, prometheus, etc., or develop it yourself. 2. Monitoring system server: software deployed in the cloud or on a local server, used to receive data from the server monitor, and perform processing, analysis, and alarming. You can choose a mature monitoring system or develop it yourself. 3. Alarm mechanism: When the monitoring system detects that the server is abnormal or reaches the set threshold, it will immediately send an alarm message to the administrator so that measures can be taken in time. 4. APP: Provide real-time monitoring status display, including server resource usage, logs, historical graphs, etc., and provide remote operation and control functions. Can support multiple operating systems, such as iOS, Android, etc. 5. Data storage: The monitoring system will store the monitoring data for a long time, which is convenient for future analysis, query and other operations. Overall, the monitoring system can help administrators optimize and maintain servers based on real-time data and trends, improve server stability and reliability, and also facilitate remote monitoring. It should be noted that the implementation of the system needs to fully consider issues such as server resource occupation, data collection and transmission accuracy, and security.
