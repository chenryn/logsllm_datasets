Reasons for killing someone
Hinder 
•
Kill off your investigating detectives. Subpoena and indictments cant be issued by a dead person. Dead people 
find it difficult to travel.
•
Kill your opposing lawyer, the judge or IRS audit officer to slow them down
Financial - $$$$$
•
Kill yourself. Enjoy your Life Insurance whilst your alive. No more sinking your boat at sea, or hiding out 
in Mexico. Start with a new Identification. 
•
Kill your elderly parents to get their estate. They just wont die quick enough.
Revenge 
•
Revenge on your ex-wife/girlfriend/partner. They will be dead and not even know it.
•
Your boss is a asshole. As their Executor shut down their bank accounts, drivers license, phone 
plan, cable and utilities
The Law isn’t written for the Dead

New York Times: DEAD MAN WALKING (OHIO) 2013
“Legally dead dad must stay that way even if he's 
technically alive”
Donald Miller was declared dead in 1994 after he 
skipped out on his ex-wife, two daughters and massive 
child support payments. He was declared dead after 
missing for five years.
Now the living 61-year-old wants to resurrect his legal 
status, but a judge says he's too late. Ohio law sets a 
three-year window to challenge a decision in a 
declaration of death.
The Judge said ‘Even though you’re sitting here in my courtroom, I see you, you’re alive, you seem to be in 
good health, the law restricts me from reversing the prior finding of death” 
Putting it all together

Virtuals can do the following

“Do Over” Identification for a life screw up. Criminal/Bankruptcy – A spare Life ID.
Life insurance policies for death benefits without killing off yourself or elderly parents.
Be the head of company or Shelf company with  so you cant be touched. “Prevent the piecing of the veil” Asset 
protection for people suing you.
Buy highly leveraged derivatives without fear of loss. If the trade pays off fantastic, if not, the virtual can be 
killed off for the life insurance or bankrupted and put on the shelf for 3-7 years as defective stock (harder to 
get finance) and sold as a discount.  
Obtain Firearms or Import Drugs and Firearms with a Virtual Identity
Anonymity  
IP / Location    = TOR / VPN / Anonymity box
Payments         = Bitcoin 
Company         =  Shell/Shelf
Identity            =  A VIRTUAL 
If any of the technical mechanisms above fail, like for Ross Ulbricht as an example, why not have the last 
guy holding the gun…………non existent 
Death and Birth – Vulnerabilities Overview
Anyone with this knowledge can kill another person or
group of people “mass murder” on paper as it stands
for revenge, kicks or profit. This affects hundreds of
millions of people.
This is a Global Problem – U.S, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and Europe.
“You could be dead right now and not even know it”
Death and Birth - Vulnerabilities
•
Going from a paper based system to Online facility for Medical Doctors with a DIY portal 
(ERDS) or no portal (Australia) makes Death Registration for hackers easy world wide. 
•
Using public details such as Registration/Licence Numbers as the “No one knows identifier” 
allows fake birth/registration by legitimate doctors. 
•
Basic or no licensing for Funeral Directors allows anyone to be a Funeral Director for 
abuse. 
•
DIY portal or automated response for Funeral Directors allows hackers to be a fake 
funeral director or a real Funeral director to complete the Death Registration process

Why is it Swiss Cheese – The Government
•
The Government want accurate, centralised birth and death records. There have been records
lost due to fire damage or floods in some states. No one can read doctors handwriting.
The Government
•
Struggling to ensure that babies registered and put into the system. The government want to
make birth registration as simple as possible to give children a chance to work, pay taxes and on
the system. 2.5% of babies in 2012 in Victoria were not registered.
•
The Government have historically used the premise that for the death and burial of a person
required two or three professional industries, the Medical, Coroner and Funeral Director. To
dispose of a body improperly would require collusion between all parties.
•
Moving from paper based system to online system with industries that’s always been paper based
without security portal controls
