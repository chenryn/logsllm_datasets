**Current behavior**  
Related to #9047. AppConfig is loaded using APP_INITIALIZER. Before the
returned promise has been resolved, the initializer for the requested route is
already invoked. The initializer will fail if it requires settings from
AppConfig
**Expected behavior**
The route resolvers should be invoked after the APP_INITIALIZER promise(s)
have been resolved
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Use API url from AppConfig in a resolver
