### Current Behavior
This issue is related to #9047. The `AppConfig` is loaded using `APP_INITIALIZER`. However, the initializer for the requested route is invoked before the promise returned by `APP_INITIALIZER` has been resolved. This causes the initializer to fail if it requires settings from `AppConfig`.

### Expected Behavior
The route resolvers should be invoked only after all `APP_INITIALIZER` promises have been resolved.

### Minimal Reproduction of the Problem
- **Link to reproduction:** [Plunker Example](https://plnkr.co/edit/PbTGxQ2X1aKUVfUvJdcO?p=preview)
- **Instructions:**
  - Open the provided Plunker link.
  - Observe the behavior when navigating to a route that requires initialization.
  - Note that the route initializer fails because `AppConfig` is not yet available.

### Motivation / Use Case
The goal is to use an API URL from `AppConfig` in a route resolver. This ensures that the resolver can access the necessary configuration before performing any operations.

### Environment Information
- **Angular Version:** 2.4.8
  - *Note:* I have not tested with earlier versions, but I believe this issue was not present in 2.4.7.
- **Browser:** Chrome (though the issue seems to be browser-agnostic)
- **Language:** TypeScript
