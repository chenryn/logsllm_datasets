Abstract. Previous studies on inferring the origin of routing changes in
the Internet are limited to failure events that generate a large number
of routing changes. In this paper, we present a novel approach to origin
inference of small failure events. Our scheme focuses on routing changes
imposed on preferred paths of preﬁxes and not on transient paths trig-
gered by path exploration. We ﬁrst infer the preferred path of each preﬁx
and measure the stability of each inter-AS link over this preferred path.
The stability is measured based on routing changes of speciﬁc preﬁxes
that regularly use the link and are advertised by the AS adjacent to the
link. We then correlate the stability of other links over this path and
infer the instability boundary as the origin. Our analysis using Oregon
RouteViews data and trouble tickets from operational networks shows
that our inference scheme can identify the origins of small failure events
with very high accuracy.
1 Introduction
An inter-domain link failure in the Internet can cause routing changes of hun-
dreds of thousands of preﬁxes advertised over the Internet. While some preﬁxes
may preserve reachability through an alternative path, other preﬁxes may be-
come unreachable and thus aﬀect the data delivery of users seeking those des-
tinations. From the ISP’s point of view, operators are interested in ﬁnding the
origin of these routing changes to identify possible locations of failure events.
The origin information could then be used by operators to distinguish stable
links from unstable links when seeking new transits. However, with the large
number of routing changes observed in the Internet today, identifying the origin
of these changes has been diﬃcult [1,2].
Analyzing the sequence of update messages exchanged in Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) [3] has helped explaining the routing changes encountered by
each preﬁx. Earlier work represented in [5,6] analyzed these routing updates
across time, observation points and preﬁxes to locate origins. However, the use
of the time threshold to group routing updates resulted in correlating unrelated
updates triggered by diﬀerent network events [2] and transient updates triggered
by path exploration [7,8]. A more recent work in [9,10] took a diﬀerent approach
to capturing routing changes using the Link-Rank [11]. In [11], for each inter-AS
link, the number of preﬁxes gained or lost is extracted from routing updates and

compared at given intervals (3-4 minutes) to ﬁnd signiﬁcant variations. While
this approach enables routing changes to be captured eﬃciently, origin inference
in the Internet is limited to failure events that generate a large number of routing
changes because a small deviation is constantly observed for the majority of links.
In this paper, we present a novel scheme for origin inference of small failure
events. Our main idea is that most preﬁxes have one preferred path and a routing
change imposed on this path should indicate a failure or policy change at one
of the nodes or links that construct the path. We thus ﬁrst infer the preferred
path of each preﬁx and extend the Link-Rank concept to measure the stability of
each inter-AS link over this preferred path. The stability is measured using only
the preﬁxes that regularly use the link and are advertised by the AS adjacent
to the link to ﬁlter the noise caused by path exploration. We then correlate the
stability of other links over this path and infer the instability boundary as the
origin. This paper makes the following contributions. First, we present a novel
approach based on preferred path changes for correlating routing updates and
additionally present a scheme for eﬀectively inferring the origins of small routing
changes. Second, we describe a methodology for inferring the actual time of
failure (not the time of detection) and the time of recovery, both of which provide
operators with very valuable information. Third, we provide evaluation results
using Oregon RouteViews data and trouble tickets from operational networks.
2 Eﬀect of Path Exploration on Origin Inference
The eﬀect of BGP path exploration on origin inference has not been deeply
discussed in the past. In this section, we ﬁrst describe how path exploration
occurs and illustrate its eﬀect on origin inference.
2.1 Path Exploration of BGP
Path exploration is a state in which a BGP router explores multiple alternative
paths during convergence to a new best path. We illustrate an example using
Figure 1. In the ﬁgure, AS20 to AS70 announces preﬁxes p20 to p70. The link
between AS40 and AS60 fails and AS40 reacts by sending withdraw messages
for p60 and p70 to its neighbors (#1 in Figure 1). When AS20 ﬁrst receives
this message, it announces to AS10 the path via AS30 as the new best path
to reach p60 and p70, not knowing about the failure (#2). However, shortly
after this announcement, AS20 receives a withdraw message from AS30 (#3)
where it then announces to AS10 the alternative path via AS50 as the new best
path (#4). In some cases, a withdraw message is observed immediately before
the announce message due to possible convergence delay or an implementation
bug [4]. Now suppose that at some point in time, the failed link is repaired and
AS10 eventually receives the same best path observed before the link failure.
Table 1 summarizes the AS paths observed for this event. As the table shows
several transient paths are likely to be triggered during path exploration and
selecting the update with the correct AS path is essential for an accurate origin
inference.

2.2 Eﬀect of Path Exploration on Measurement
Using the above example, we examin the eﬀect of path exploration on origin
inference. Table 2 shows the number of preﬁxes of each inter-AS link extracted
from the routing table (Routing Information Base) created at the monitoring
point. Each RIB consists of a list of preﬁxes and their preferred AS paths. We
assume that RIBT 1 represents the initial routing table created before the link
failure. As shown in Table 2, this single failure and recovery event causes a
variance of one or more preﬁx at all nine links. If a simple threshold is used
to detect only those links that lose all preﬁxes as emphasized in the table, ﬁve
links are still left as candidates, where two of the links are detected twice. In
the Internet, failure events occur simultaneously and variance is likely to occur
much more frequently making origin inference complicated and diﬃcult.
3 Detecting Candidate Origins
In this section, we describe a methodology for detecting candidate origins. The
detected candidates are correlated with other links to infer origins in Section 4.

3.1 Selection of Measurement Preﬁxes for Each Link
The observation from the previous example suggests that we must avoid un-
wanted variations that occur during path exploration after link failure and after
link recovery. To achieve this, for each link we focus on a set of preﬁxes that
are regularly advertised over the link and from the AS adjacent to the link.
Speciﬁcally, for link (X,Y), we use preﬁxes that are advertised from Y regularly
through X. Using the dashed lines in Figure 1 as the preferred path of each preﬁx,
Table 3 shows the number of speciﬁc preﬁxes extracted for each inter-AS link.
As the table shows, variations only occur at the origin link (40,60) and the edge
link (60,70) and not at other links. Note that links (20,60), (30,40) and (50,60)
are considered temporary links and variations are no longer measured since none
of the preﬁxes advertised by AS40 and AS60 prefer these links.
To infer preferred paths of preﬁxes in the Internet, we use the path preference
inference scheme based on usage time of paths described in [8]. For example, for
n AS paths (except NULL paths = withdrawn) observed for preﬁx pi, denoted as
{pathi
n}, we measure the cumulative duration of the usage time
of each path, denoted as {T pathi
n}. We then calculate for
1
each pathi
j the usage ratio Rpathi
j using Equation 1. The path with the highest
ratio Rpathi
pref is inferred as the preferred path for pi.

We validate this scheme using BGP data collected at two monitoring points pro-
vided by Oregon RouteViews [12] over the month of September 2009. AS22388
(TRANSPAC2) is a high-speed research and education network connecting the
Asia-Paciﬁc region with networks in the U.S. AS3356 (LEVEL3) is one of the
Tier 1 networks located in the U.S. For both monitoring points, we observed that
approximately 55% of the preﬁxes have one preferred path (Rpathpref = 1).
These preﬁxes either only had one path to the monitoring point or remained
stable during the entire measurement period. For approximately 97% and 92%
of the preﬁxes, we observed Rpathpref to be very high (over 0.9) for AS22388
and AS3356, respectively. This indicates that for most preﬁxes, we can infer the
preferred path with very high probability. We also found that Rpathpref is lower
than 0.5 for less than 1% of the preﬁxes indicating a low probability for most
preﬁxes to encounter signiﬁcant changes in policies during a 1-month period.
3.2 Detecting Links as Candidate Origins
Table 3 showed that variations also occurs when path exploration is triggered
after the link is repaired. In order to avoid detecting the same link multiple times
during path exploration, we limit the detection to only when a routing change
is imposed on preferred paths. In Table 3 for example, the number of preﬁxes
at link (40,60) recover at T 5 and drop again at T 6, but this second drop is not
detected as the path observed at T 5 is not the preferred path of this preﬁx. This
leaves two links as candidate origins; T 3:(40,60) and T 3:(60,70).
4 The Origin Inference Scheme
The candidate set of links may include links that are actually not origins. This
can occur when the reachability of preﬁxes are lost due to a failure at a transit
link. One approach to cope with this problem is to utilize BGP data collected
from multiple monitoring points. For example, if AS60 also served as a monitor-
ing point, stable reachability to p70 may be observed during the event. However,
such an assumption is not eﬀective unless all ASes work as monitoring points.
There is also the question of whether a routing change can be mutually observed
at diﬀerent monitoring points.
Instead we correlate candidate origins with other origins detected over the
preferred path and use simple heuristics to infer one candidate as the origin.
This is based on our idea that most preﬁxes have one preferred path and a
routing change imposed on this path should indicate a failure or policy change
at one of the nodes or links that construct the path. The correlation of candidates
is ﬁrst given window time T to absorb possible delays in the detection of other
candidate links due to the propagation delay among updates and preﬁxes. We
summarize the algorithm below.
