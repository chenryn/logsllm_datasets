User: What could be the best way to distribute a python application to both windows and mac user without scaring them away during the installation process? 
I'm writing a software which will be of help to my university's students. This software will be used by student of various discipline, a lot from those which have little to no programming background. 
It would be best if there are some one click magic happens solution to the installation.
How should I go about doing them? Please advice!
Assistant: This is a pretty broad question.  The "best way" to distribute any software is to use a software distribution/systems management suite. It takes time to implement but once done the time savings is enormous.  There are several suites that will do this; I believe that AirWatch will work as will ThingWorx, Helix Device Cloud, and others.  These solutions can do what is called a "required distribution" which will simple force the software down.  There's not even a click; the software is just there as of the date you specify.  
Now, if you don't want to invest time in a solution like this, then use the MSI format for Windows.  That is a superior way to install software - the user double-clicks on the software and, if you've done the MSI a certain way, the install happens.  There's a user decision to install which some won't take advantage of.  Again, that only works on Windows, sorry.  I'm not versed in Mac installations but I'm sure that there's a way to build installers for Mac as well.
If your users get scared during a normal software install, well, you've got a different problem.  If they're familiar with computers at all, they've seen software install before and have most likely done it.
