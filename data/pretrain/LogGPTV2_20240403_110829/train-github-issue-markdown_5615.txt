### Elasticsearch Configuration and Cluster Joining Issues

**Elasticsearch Version:** 0.90.1  
**Number of Servers:** 16  
**Nodes per Server:** 2 (Total Nodes: 32)

When configuring the `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` setting using the formula `N/2 + 1` (where `N` is the total number of master-eligible nodes), the following issues arise:

- **Setting `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 17`**:
  - **Result:** The node will not join the cluster.
  
- **Setting `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 5`**:
  - **Result:** The node successfully joins the cluster.
  
- **Setting `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` to any value above 5**:
  - **Result:** The node fails to join the cluster.

### Current Configuration
- **Unicast Hosts:**
  ```yaml
  discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["node1", "node6", "node11", "node16"]
  ```

### Observations
- **With `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 5`**:
  - The node joins the cluster without issues.
  
- **Changing `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 5` to `6`**:
  - **Result:** The node does not join the cluster.
  
- **Adding an additional host to `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts`**:
  - **Result:** The node successfully joins the cluster when `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` is set to 6.

### Conclusion
- To ensure that the node joins the cluster, the `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` setting must be increased by 1, and a corresponding additional host must be added to the `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts` list.

This behavior is consistent, and it appears that the number of unicast hosts must match or exceed the `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` setting for the node to join the cluster successfully.
