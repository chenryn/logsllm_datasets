Elastic Search Version: 0.90.1  
Number of servers: 16  
Nodes: 32 (2 nodes per server)
When using N/2+1 to set the "discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes":
**discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 17**
The node will never join the cluster. I can set it to:
**discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 5**
And it joins, but setting it to any number above 5 and it all not join.
Currently I have 4 hosts in the "discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: "
**discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["node1", "node6", "node11", "node16"]**
If I change "discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 5" to "6" the node will not
join the cluster. However if I add an additional host to
"discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts:" the node will then join the cluster. This
behavior is consistant, +1 to master_node and I need to add a host to unicast
setting.
