 **Current behavior**
I have component with class bindings which look like:
classFromProp2= true  
when resizing screen classFromProp1 changes and foo-class gets lost.
this behavior works as expected if I use [ngClass]="{'foo-class':
classFromProp2}"
**Expected behavior**  
should merge classes correctly
  * **Angular version:** 2.0.X  
~2.4.0
