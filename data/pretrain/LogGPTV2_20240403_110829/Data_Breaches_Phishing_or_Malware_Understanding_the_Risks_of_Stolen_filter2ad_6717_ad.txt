hijacking attacks; brute force login attempts; and challenges with
recovery and re-compromise.
5.1 Current password match rate
Stolen credentials pose a significant risk to authentication sys-
tems built solely on usernames and passwords. To approximate
this risk, we scan through all email addresses and passwords in
our dataset in search of Google users. We extend this search to
non-email usernames by looking up whether any Google account
exists under the same username (e.g., for Cindy001, we would check
PI:EMAIL and other Google-related domains). For ex-
isting users, we then verify whether the password exposed to mis-
creants matches the user’s current Google password. In order to
stem any future abuse, we force all victims with exposed, valid
credentials to reset their passwords. We note that in the case of cre-
dential leaks, our experiment measures long-term password re-use,
while for phishing kits and keyloggers there are multiple factors at
play we discuss shortly.
Credential leaks re-use rate. We identify a total of 751,133,653
Google users affected by third-party breaches,5 of which 51,754,113
had valid passwords—a match rate of 6.9%, if we include unsalted
passwords that we failed to invert. If we exclude all victims with non-
inverted passwords (thus biasing towards weak passwords which
victims may re-use more frequently), the match rate increases to
7.5%. We note these rates are likely underestimates, as users may
have changed their passwords between the time the password was
exposed and our check; we may have previously reset the victim’s
password from a prior credential leak; or because our approach
to mapping usernames to Google accounts may over-count the
number of existing accounts which are in fact unrelated to the
victim of a credential leak. Across all of our credential leaks, the
median match rate per file including non-inverted passwords is
7.0%. While this percentage is small, in aggregate, data breaches
continue to expose millions of valid passwords.
Phishing & Keylogger match rate. For victims of phishing
kits, we identify a total of 2,335,289 Google users, of which 578,434
had valid passwords—a match rate of 24.8%. For keyloggers, our
sample is much smaller and consists of 1,616 Google users, only
192 of which had valid passwords—a match rate of 11.9%. Using the
timestamps reported through our undisclosed source, we compare
the match rate of passwords exposed in the first 6 months of our
time window versus the last 6 months and find the rate falls within
the margin of error (23.1% vs. 24.1% for phishing kits; 12.2% vs.
10.4% for keyloggers). This suggests that even a year later, victims
remain unaware their passwords were ever exposed and at risk.
5We exclude victims appearing in salted or encrypted credential leaks so as not to
underestimate long-term password re-use.

Having ruled out staleness, one explanation for the low match
rates is that numerous services rely on email addresses for user-
names, though victims may diversify passwords between their email
provider and these other services (a promising sign). As our pass-
word dataset lacks an annotation of the service targeted, we cannot
limit our analysis to Google-specific attacks. Likewise, victims may
supply intentionally incorrect information to phishing pages to
“test” whether the login is real. We find 5% of gmail.com emails
provided to phishing pages do not exist, indicating either a savvy
user or security service submitting fake credentials.
5.2 Historical password match rate
As stolen credentials become stale over time, our analysis of cre-
dential leaks dating back to 2012–2014 may underestimate the risk
of password re-use. To better understand contemporaneous pass-
word re-use metrics, we examine the overlap of passwords for
users affected by multiple data breaches. We restrict our analysis
to fully inverted leaks (with 100% plaintext passwords after inver-
sion) where we have a high confidence in the origin due to manual
acquisition—otherwise, copies or portions of the same leak appear-
ing on multiple paste sites may cause us to overestimate re-use.
Across the 7 largest fully inverted leaks of known distinct origins
(listed in Table 3), we observe that 17.0% of the 22 million email
addresses in multiple leaks re-used a password at least once. Fig-
ure 5 depicts the pairwise password re-use rate for each set of leaks.
While the Taobao and Neopets leaks had the most extensive pass-
word re-use (for 38% of common emails), the majority of password
re-use rates varied between 12% and 19%. Interestingly, for email
addresses in at least three leaks, only 7.1% re-used a password two
times or more, indicating that while users may re-use passwords
across multiple sites, universal use of the same password is less
common. For comparison, Das et al. analyzed 10 plaintext (or fully
inverted) leaks from 2006–2012 and found a 43% re-use rate for
6,077 accounts [9]. Our sample from 2012–2014 is much larger and
indicates that password re-use is less frequent.
5.3 Hijacking risk
We evaluate the likelihood a user falls victim to hijacking given
they appear in our dataset of stolen credentials. In order to mitigate
the risk of exposed passwords, Google blocks or requires additional
authentication information when a login falls outside a user’s risk
profile, similar to an approach by Freeman et al. [13]. This profile
encapsulates a user’s historical access patterns, known devices, and
known locations. The full details of this calculation are beyond the
scope of this work. Independently, Google also monitors account
activity to detect suspicious behaviors for authenticated users in
Figure 5: Heatmap of password re-use rates, comparing
leaks pairwise.
order to detect victims who have been hijacked. This detection is
unbiased as to how the victim was first compromised.
To understand the impact of risk-based login scores, we calculate
the odds ratio that a Google account in our dataset with a valid
password was hijacked between March, 2016–March, 2017 com-
pared to a random sample of all Google accounts. We rely on odds
ratios rather than raw likelihoods as hijacking detection has an
unquantified number of false negatives (though near-zero false pos-
itives). We present a breakdown of our results in Table 9. We find
that once a user’s valid credentials are exposed to a phishing kit,
the likelihood they become compromised is over 400x more than
a random user. In contrast, for victims affected by data breaches,
the odds of becoming compromised are an order of magnitude less:
roughly 10x. This discrepancy stems in part from phishing kits
collecting additional information related to victims including their
login location, User-Agent, and even recovery questions (discussed
in Section 4.3), whereas credential leaks often only include the user-
name and password. Keyloggers fall in between these extremes,
with an odds ratio of roughly 40x. As such, while credential leaks
represent the largest source of passwords in our dataset (even tak-
ing into account match rates), phishing victims are the most likely
to become hijacked.
5.4 Brute force password guessing
For accounts without valid passwords, we also examine whether
attackers attempt to brute force access to the account, potentially
trying variations of the exposed password as an initial seed. Using
a sample of all logins from a one week period, we calculate the odds
that a victim appearing in our dataset receives at least 10 failed
logins compared to a random sample of users. Table 9 shows our
results. While we find some evidence of inflated failed sign-ins—
1.4x to 1.7x more than random users—we do not find any strong
evidence that attackers are permuting invalid passwords. That said,
our analysis window is fairly limited due to privacy reasons; it may
be attackers behave differently in other time periods.
5.5 Recovery rate
In the event Google detects an account as hijacked, it proactively
disables login access and invalidates any existing sessions. While
Figure 6: Duration an account remains temporarily disabled
due to hijacking before the true owner recovers access.
this lock down prevents further abuse, it raises a subsequent chal-
lenge where users must prove ownership beyond a password in
order to re-gain access to their account. Google relies on a spec-
trum of challenges to prove historical access: sending a code to a
pre-configured second email address or phone number; answering
a secret question; or identifying prior product usage times. Roughly
70.5% of hijacked users successfully pass these challenges to recover
their account. We provide a breakdown of the time frame between
when an account was disabled and re-enabled in Figure 6. A me-
dian user takes 168 days to re-secure their account. This long delay
arrives in part from users being unaware they are hijacked, and
Google lacking an alternate notification mechanism in the absence
of a recovery phone or recovery email. Furthermore, users may be
confused why they cannot login.
For those users that do successfully recover from a hijacking
incident, we examine what fraction change their security posture
post-recovery. We find only limited evidence of improving account
security: roughly 3.1% of users enable second-factor authentication.
Our results suggest there is a significant gap in educating users
about how to protect their accounts from further risk. This mirrors
previous findings by Ablon et al. where only 4% of users migrated
to password managers after being notified their data was exposed
by a breach [1], as well as results by Ion et al. who found that
while experts commonly favor using two-factor authentication
or password managers, these tools are virtually absent from the
security posture of regular users [23].
5.6 Recompromise rate
As a final metric, we examine the likelihood that victims hijacked
in the last year become hijacked again in the same time window.
We restrict this analysis to only accounts that were successfully
recovered. In total, only 2% of users fall victim to repeat hijacking.
This indicates that password resetting may be a sufficient response
to address account compromise. For repeat victims, one possibility
is that malware infections harvest newly changed passwords, or
that they were deceived by a phishing attack after their initial
recovery.

Zooming out, we leverage our unique dataset to explore the most
influential phishing kits and keyloggers fueling the ecosystem of
credential theft. We examine which blackhat tools are most popular
in the wild and how they changed during the course of our study. We
also explore the miscreants deploying these tools and the regions
where they are most active.
6.1 Popularity of tools
With 4,069 phishing kit variants and 52 keylogger variants in oper-
ation during our measurement window, which ones see the most
widespread use? As a metric of popularity, we examine the number
of unique Gmail exfiltration emails per variant (e.g., the exfiltration
email received at least one message matching that particular phish-
ing kit or keylogger’s reporting template). We note it is possible
that multiple kit variants all report to the same exfiltration point.
Our results in Figure 7 indicate that the majority of blackhat tools
are unpopular: 69% of phishing kit variants have fewer than 10
associated exfiltration points, while the same is true for 48% of
keyloggers.
However, if we rank the tools by the number of potential vic-
tims they impact, we find that a handful of popular tools have a
significant negative impact as shown in Table 10 and Table 11. The
most popular phishing kit—a file portal that supports “logins” from
Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL, Gmail, and other mail providers—generated
1,448,890 reports of stolen credentials to 2,599 different exfiltra-
tion emails. The other top phishing kits spoof a variety of brands
including file storage services like Dropbox and Office 365; web
mail providers like Workspace Webmail (operated by GoDaddy)
and AOL; and even business services like Docusign (legal signing
service) and ZoomInfo (business information service).
The most popular keylogger, HawkEye, sent 409,837 reports of
victim activity to 470 exfiltration emails. Originally available on
hawkeyeproducts.com for $35, a second “Hawkeye Reborn” version
was released via hawkspy.net along with multiple cracked versions.
Hawkeye supports stealing credentials from browsers, mail clients,
and chat clients in additional to multiple exfiltration options (SMTP,
FTP, and HTTP). Other popular kits in use during our year-long
investigation include Cyborg, Predator Pain, Limitless, and Olympic
Vision—the majority of which are free (or cracked) keyloggers avail-
able on blackmarket forums. The large discrepancy in the number
of exfiltration emails between keyloggers and phishing kits likely
stems from the ease of deploying a website and attracting visitors
versus deceiving users into installing a binary and contending with
anti-virus protections.
6.2 Usage over time
As an alternative measure to popularity, we also examine the long-
term usage of phishing kit and keylogger variants. Figure 8 provides
a breakdown of the number of days we saw activity from each
blackhat tool. Roughly 50% of keylogger variants remained active
for the entire year duration of our study. This likely stems from
a lack of diversity in keyloggers and a slow release cycle for new
variants. In contrast, only 21% of phishing kits remained active
over the course of the year. Re-examining the most popular tools
in Table 10 and Table 11, all remained active for the entirety of the
Figure 7: Number of email addresses configured to receive
stolen credentials for each blackhat tool (log scale).
