Hello,
straight to the point:
To reproduce:
  1. Go to Bootstrap website, collapse secition: link
  2. Open up webdeveloper tools (I use Google Chrome), go to Console tab and execute: `$("#collapse .accordion-body:last").collapse("show");`
  3. Result: The last accordion opens, but the first isn't closed.
The problem (briefly):  
The third accordion doesn't have `parent` option set, because we didn't
provide it.
The workaround solution:  
Start the third accordion with parent option set, and after that try to
`show()` it. Note, that `hide()` and `toggle()` also triggers this bug.
The proper solution:  
Collapse constructor should look for `parent` setting (and all other too) in
`data-` attributes of the `$()` element, as a fallback. If user doesn't
provide these options, he obviously wants the Collapse to read those from
`data-` attributes.
The cry story:  
Wasted a couple of hours, why the accordion didn't work after `show()`. It's
super counter intuitive, that the `options` aren't read from `data-`
attributes, when you start the Collapse manual way. I suppose all other
plugins inherit the same behaviour (starting by `data-` attributes reads
`options` from these attributes, where starting manual way don't).
Kind regards
\-------- Edit
It's funny when you notice your own mistake only after you cry about it.
Of course `accordion-body` doesn't have `data-` attributes to read from, so
the `The proper solution` isn't quite working. But the problem remains. How do
we mix the auto `data-` usage with the manual usage. I.e. how to achieve such
a workflow:
  1. Start the accordion/collapse through `data-` attributes.
  2. `open()`, `hide()`, `toggle()`, `whatever()` the accordion manually (occasionally) later on.
?
\-------- Edit
Ok, it was quite easy: `$("#collapse .accordion-body:last").collapse({parent:
"#accordion2"}, "show");`. But, can you see the notobviousleness of this
solution? If I wanna `show()` an accordion, I don't wanna think to which
`parent` it belongs, since I've already provided the information in the
`accordion-toggle`. I just want the damn thing to show itself properly ;p.
Also note the information duplication in this solution, which simply leads to
maintenance hell in the future.
