Question: "If a web application developer wants to prevent the website from being framed on another site, potentially leading to clickjacking attacks, which CSP directive would best serve this purpose and why?"
 "A": "The 'default-src' directive, because it sets a default source list for all content types."
 "B": "The 'script-src' directive, since scripts are the most common vector for clickjacking."
 "C": "The 'frame-ancestors' directive, because it specifies valid parents that may embed a page."
 "D": "The 'base-uri' directive, as it restricts the base URL for relative URLs in the document."
Answer: C
