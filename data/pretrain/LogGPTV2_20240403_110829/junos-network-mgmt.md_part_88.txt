2 Software (ELS) configuration style. If your switch runs software that does not support ELS, see
"Example: Configuring Mirroring for Remote Monitoring of Employee Resource Use on EX4300
Switches" on page 1099. For ELS details see: Getting Started with Enhanced Layer 2 Software.
EX4300 switches enable you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering a VLAN on EX4300 switches
You can analyze the mirrored traffic by using a protocol analyzer application running on a remote
monitoring station if you are sending mirrored traffic to an analyzer VLAN.
This topic includes two related examples that describe how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch
to the remote-analyzer VLAN so that you can perform analysis from a remote monitoring station. The first
example shows how to mirror all traffic entering the ports connected to employee computers. The
second example shows the same scenario but includes a filter to mirror only the employee traffic going
to the Web.
BEST PRACTICE: Mirror only necessary packets to reduce potential performance impact. We
recommend that you:
1100
• Disable your configured mirroring sessions when you are not using them.
• Specify individual interfaces as input to analyzers rather than specifying all interfaces as
input.
• Limit the amount of mirrored traffic by using firewall filters.
This example describes how to configure remote mirroring:
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• Junos OS Release 13.2X50-D10 or later for EX Series switches
• An EX4300 switch connected to another EX4300 switch
The diagram shows an EX4300 Virtual Chassis connected to an EX4300 destination switch.
Before you configure remote mirroring, be sure that:
• You have an understanding of mirroring concepts.
• The interfaces that the analyzer will use as input interfaces have been configured on the switch.
Overview and Topology
IN THIS SECTION
Topology | 1101
This topic includes two related examples that describe how to configure mirroring to the remote-analyzer
VLAN so that analysis can be performed from a remote monitoring station. The first example shows how
to configure a switch to mirror all traffic from employee computers. The second example shows the
same scenario, but the setup includes a filter to mirror only the employee traffic going to the Web.
Figure 39 on page 1101 shows the network topology for both these example scenarios.
1101
Topology
Figure 39: Remote Mirroring Network Topology Example
In this example:
1. Interface ge-0/0/0 is a Layer 2 interface, and interface ge-0/0/1 is a Layer 3 interface (both
interfaces on the source switch) that serve as connections for employee computers.
2. Interface ge-0/0/10 is a Layer 2 interface that connects the source switch to the destination switch.
3. Interface ge-0/0/5 is a Layer 2 interface that connects the destination switch to the remote
monitoring station.
4. VLAN remote-analyzer is configured on all switches in the topology to carry the mirrored traffic.

Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure port mirroring of all traffic from the two ports connected to employee computers to the
remote-analyzer VLAN for use from a remote monitoring station:
1. On the source switch:
1108
• Configure the employee-web-monitor port mirroring instance:
[edit ]
user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching port mode trunk
user@switch# set forwarding-options port-mirroring instance employee-web-monitor output
vlan 999
• Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
• Configure the interface to associate it with the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
• Configure the firewall filter called watch-employee:
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from destination-address
192.0.2.16/24
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from source-address
192.0.2.16/24
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp then accept
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web from destination-port 80
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web then port-mirror-instance
employee-web-monitor
• Apply the firewall filter to the employee interfaces:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
user@switch# set ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
2. On the destination switch:
1109
• Configure the VLAN ID for the remote-analyzer VLAN:
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set remote-analyzer vlan-id 999
• Configure the interface on the destination switch for trunk mode and associate it with the remote-
analyzer VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 999
• Configure the interface connected to the destination switch for trunk mode:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/5 unit 0 family ethernet-switching interface-mode trunk
• Configure the employee-monitor analyzer:
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
user@switch# set instance employee-web-monitor input ingress vlan remote-analyzer
user@switch# set instance employee-web-monitor output interface ge-0/0/5.0
