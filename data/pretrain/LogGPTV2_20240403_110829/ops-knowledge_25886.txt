User: I have a bit of a problem with the ftplib from python. It seems that it uses, per default, two connections (one for sending commands, one for datatransfer?). However my ftpserver only accepts one connection at any given time. Since the only file that needs to be transfered is only about 1 MB large, the reasoning of being able to abort inflight commands does not apply here.
Previously the same job was done by the windows commandline ftp client. So I could just call this client from python, but I would really prefer a complete python solution.
Is there a way to tell ftplib, that it should limit itself to a single connection? In filezilla I'm able to "limit the maximum number of simultanious connections", ideally I would like to reproduce this functionality.
Thanks for your help.

That's how ftp works. You have a control connection (usually port 21) for commands and a data connection for data transfer, file listing etc and a dynamic port.

However my ftpserver only accepts one connection at any given time.

ftpserver might have a limit for multiple control connections, but it must still accept data connections. Could you please show from tcpdump, wireshark, logfiles etc why you think multiple connections are the problem?

This is for the number of control connections only. Does it work with filezilla? Because I doubt that ftplib opens multiple control connections.
