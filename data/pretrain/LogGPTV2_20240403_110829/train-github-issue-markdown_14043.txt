Currently empty form fields are mapped to "" (empty string). This has several
issues:
  1. Neither a `@NotNull` JSR-303 constraint or a "not null" relational DB constraint fails in this case. You're left with defining a min `@Size` constraint or relying on a implementation-specific `@NotEmpty`. In addition, there is no DB min constraint you can define at the Db level. Simply mapping "" to null would solve these problems and we could just rely on `@NotNull`/not null.
