User: I have both Python 2.7 and 3.4 installed on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine.  I want to install the 'requests' module so it is accessible from Py3.4.
When I issued pip install requests on my terminal cmd line I got back:

"Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): requests in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"

How can I direct pip to install requests for 3.4 even though it is already in 2.7?
Assistant: i was facing same issue in beautiful soup , I solved this issue by this command , your issue will also get rectified . 
You are unable to install requests in python 3.4 because your python libraries are not updated . 
use this command 
apt-get install python3-requests
Just run it will ask you to add 222 MB space in your hard disk , just press Y and wait for completing process, after ending up whole process . check your problem will be resolved.
