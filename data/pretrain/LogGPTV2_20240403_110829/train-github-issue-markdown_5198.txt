The complete source code with the issue can be found at:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sorriso/TodoSRV)

This repository contains a small, evolving sample of a full Todo application. The architecture includes:
- A Rich Internet Application (RIA) on the client side, using SproutCore 2.0 and jQuery.
- A Spring RESTful server, utilizing MyBatis, C3P0, and MySQL, with Spring Security for authentication.

### Setup Instructions:
1. **Database Creation:**
   - Ensure the database is created before proceeding.
   
2. **Spring Framework Version:**
   - To (de)activate the error message, update the Spring Framework version in the `pom.xml` file:
     - Change from `3.0.6.RELEASE` to `3.1.0.RC2` to activate the error.
     - Change from `3.1.0.RC2` back to `3.0.6.RELEASE` to deactivate the error.

3. **Application Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application on a Tomcat 7 server. For example, you can use Eclipse to launch the application.
   - Access the application via the URL: `http://localhost:8080/TodoSRV`.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Log in with the credentials: `user / user`.
   - If there are existing todo items, they will be displayed (GET command allowed).
   - If no items exist, create 2 or 3 todo items (POST command allowed). 
   - **Note:** Refresh the page after creating items to avoid a known bug that duplicates todo items. This bug is unrelated to the current issue.

5. **Marking Items as "Done":**
   - Attempt to mark a todo item as "done". An error will appear in the web inspector (e.g., Web Inspector or Firebug console) indicating that the POST command is not allowed.
   - This action works correctly with Spring Framework version `3.0.6.RELEASE`.

6. **Clearing "Done" Items:**
   - If a todo item is already marked as done, the clear action (DELETE command) works as expected.

### Additional Notes:
- The `hiddenHttpMethodFilter` has been added to the `web.xml` file.

### Affected Version:
- **Spring Framework 3.1 RC2**
