the full code source having the issue can be found here:
https://github.com/sorriso/TodoSRV
this is a small application architecture sample (still under improvement /
development) of a full todos application  
with a RIA javascript application on client side (using sproutcore 2.0,
jquery)  
and a spring Resful server (using mybatis, c3p0 and mysql) with spring
security
  * database must be create first
  * just change springframework version from 3.0.6.RELEASE to 3.1.0.RC2 (and vice versa) in pom.xml file to (de)activate error msg
  * launch the application on a tomcat 7 server (via eclipse by example)
  * open the url http://localhost:8080/TodoSRV
  * login with user / user -> if exists todos item list appears (GET command allowed)  
if not create 2 or 3 todo item (POST command allowed)  
AND REFRESH the page in order to avoid a bug (who have no link with this
issue) who duplicate todo items
  * mark as "done" a todo item -> error in webInspector / firebug console -> POST command not allowed  
(this action works fine with 3.0.6.RELEASE)
  * if a todo item is already marked as done, clear action works fine (DELETED command allowed)
filter hiddenHttpMethodFilter have been added in web.xml file
* * *
**Affects:** 3.1 RC2
