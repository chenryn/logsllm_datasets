ABSTRACT
A power grid is a complex system connecting electric power
generators to consumers through power transmission and
distribution networks across a large geographical area. Sys-
tem monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation
of power grids, and state estimation is used in system moni-
toring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis
of meter measurements and power system models. Various
techniques have been developed to detect and identify bad
measurements, including the interacting bad measurements
introduced by arbitrary, non-random causes. At ﬁrst glance,
it seems that these techniques can also defeat malicious mea-
surements injected by attackers.
In this paper, we present a new class of attacks, called
false data injection attacks, against state estimation in elec-
tric power grids. We show that an attacker can exploit the
conﬁguration of a power system to launch such attacks to
successfully introduce arbitrary errors into certain state vari-
ables while bypassing existing techniques for bad measure-
ment detection. Moreover, we look at two realistic attack
scenarios, in which the attacker is either constrained to some
speciﬁc meters (due to the physical protection of the meters),
or limited in the resources required to compromise meters.
We show that the attacker can systematically and eﬃciently
construct attack vectors in both scenarios, which can not
only change the results of state estimation, but also modify
the results in arbitrary ways. We demonstrate the success of
these attacks through simulation using IEEE test systems.
Our results indicate that security protection of the electric
power grid must be revisited when there are potentially ma-
licious attacks.

INTRODUCTION
A power grid is a complex system connecting a variety of
electric power generators to customers through power trans-
mission and distribution networks across a large geographi-
cal area, as illustrated in Figure 1. The security and reliabil-
ity of power grids has critical impact on society. For exam-
ple, on August 14, 2003, a large portion of the Midwest and
Northeast United States and Ontario, Canada, experienced
an electric power blackout, which aﬀected an area with a
population of about 50 million people. The estimated total
costs ranged between $4 billion and $10 billion (U.S. dollars)
in the United States, and totaled $2.3 billion (Canadian dol-
lars) in Canada [30].
System monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable op-
eration of power grids.
It provides pertinent information
on the condition of a power grid based on the readings of
meters placed at important area of the power grid. The me-
ter measurements may include bus voltages, bus real and
reactive power injections, and branch reactive power ﬂows
in every subsystem of a power grid. These measurements
are typically transmitted to a control center, a component
that retains crucial system data and provides centralized
monitoring and control capability for the power grid. Mea-
surements are usually stored in a telemetry system, which
is also known as Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
(SCADA) system. State estimation is used in system moni-
toring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis
of meter measurement data and power system models.
State estimation is the process of estimating unknown
state variables in a power grid based on the meter mea-
surements. The output of state estimation is typically used
in contingency analysis, which will then be used to control
the power grid components (e.g., to increase the yield of a
power generator) to maintain the reliable operation even in
the presence of faults (e.g., a generator breakdown).
It is possible for an attacker to compromise meters to in-
troduce malicious measurements. For example, there is an

online video1 that teaches people how to manipulate elec-
tric meters to cut their electricity bills. Though this meter-
hacking tutorial is about meters at the end consumers, it
is conceivable that attackers have the same kind of ability
to modify the meters in the power grid to introduce bad
measurements if they have access to these meters. If these
bad measurements aﬀect the outcome of state estimation,
they can mislead the power grid control algorithms, possi-
bly resulting in catastrophic consequences such as blackouts
in large geographic areas.
Power systems researchers have realized the threat of bad
measurements and developed techniques for processing them
(e.g., [16, 21–25]). These techniques ﬁrst detect if there
are bad measurements, and then identify and remove the
bad ones if there are any. Some of these techniques (e.g.,
[21,23,25]) were targeted at arbitrary, interacting (i.e., corre-
lated) bad measurements. At ﬁrst glance, it seems that these
approaches can also defeat the malicious measurements in-
jected by attackers, since such malicious measurements can
be considered as interacting bad measurements.
However, in this paper, we discover that all existing tech-
niques for bad measurement detection and identiﬁcation can
be bypassed if the attacker knows the conﬁguration of the
power system. The fundamental reason for this failure is
that all existing techniques for bad measurement detection
rely on the same assumption that “when bad measurements
take place, the squares of diﬀerences between the observed
measurements and their corresponding estimates often be-
come signiﬁcant [16].” Unfortunately, our investigation in-
dicates that this assumption is not always true. With the
knowledge of the power system conﬁguration, the attacker
can systematically generate bad measurements so that the
above assumption is violated, thus bypassing bad measure-
ments detection.
In this paper, we present a new class of attacks, called
false data injection attacks, against state estimation in elec-
tric power systems. By taking advantage of the conﬁgura-
tion information of a power system, an attacker can inject
malicious measurements that will mislead the state estima-
tion process without being detected by any of the existing
techniques for bad measurement detection.

State estimation uses power ﬂow models. A power ﬂow
model is a set of equations that depict the energy ﬂow on
each transmission line of a power grid. An AC power ﬂow
model is a power ﬂow model that considers both real and
reactive power and is formulated by nonlinear equations.
For large power systems, state estimation using an AC power
ﬂow model is computationally expensive and even infeasible
in many cases. Thus, power system engineers sometimes
only consider the real power and use a linearized power ﬂow
model, DC power ﬂow model, to approximate the AC power
ﬂow model [14,18]. A DC power ﬂow model is less accurate,
but simpler and more robust than an AC model [14]. In this
paper, as the ﬁrst step in our research, we focus on attacks
against state estimation using DC power ﬂow models. We
expect the results of this paper to serve as the foundation
for future research for generalized power ﬂow models.
We present false data injection attacks from the attacker’s
perspective. We ﬁrst show that it is possible for the attacker
to inject malicious measurements that can bypass existing
techniques for bad measurement detection. We then look at
two realistic attack scenarios. In the ﬁrst attack scenario,
the attacker is constrained to accessing some speciﬁc meters
due to, for example, diﬀerent physical protection of the me-
ters. In the second attack scenario, the attacker is limited in
the resources available to compromise meters. For both sce-
narios, we consider two realistic attack goals: random false
data injection attacks, in which the attacker aims to ﬁnd any
attack vector as long as it can lead to a wrong estimation
of state variables, and targeted false data injection attacks,
in which the attacker aims to ﬁnd an attack vector that can
inject arbitrary errors into certain state variables. We show
that the attacker can systematically and eﬃciently construct
attack vectors for false data injection attacks in both attack
scenarios with both attack goals.
We validate these attacks through simulation using IEEE
test systems, including IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, 118-bus,
and 300-bus systems [37]. The simulation results demon-
strate the success of these attacks. For example, to inject
a speciﬁc malicious value into one target state variable, the
attacker only needs to compromise 10 meters in most cases
in the IEEE 300-bus system, which has 1,122 meters in total.
Practical Implication: We would like to point out that
the false data injection attacks do pose strong requirements
for the attackers.
It requires that the attackers know the
conﬁguration of target power system, which is in general
not easy to access. Moreover, the attackers have to manipu-
late some meters or their measurements before they are used
for state estimation. Nevertheless, it is critical for power en-
gineers and security people to be aware of this threat. Ex-
isting state estimation and the follow-up processes such as
contingency analysis assume near-perfect detection of large
bad measurements, while our results indicate that the at-
tackers can always bypass the detection by manipulating
the measurement values. Such a discrepancy may be am-
pliﬁed in the processes following state estimation and leads
to catastrophic impacts (e.g., blackouts in large geographic
areas).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
gives background and related work. Section 3 presents the
basic principle of false data injection attacks, and gives the
approaches for both random and targeted false data injec-
tion attacks in the two attack scenarios. Section 4 demon-
strates the success of these attacks through simulation. Sec-
22tion 5 concludes this paper and points out future research
directions.
2. PRELIMINARIES
Power System (Power Grid): A power transmission
system (or simply a power system) consists of electric gen-
erators, transmission lines, and transformers that form an
electrical network [31]. This network is also called a power
grid.
It connects a variety of electric generators together
with a host of users across a large geographical area. Re-
dundant paths and lines are provided so that power can be
routed from any power plant to any customer, through a va-
riety of routes, based on the economics of the transmission
path and the cost of power. A control center is usually used
to monitor and control the power system and devices in a
geographical area.
State Estimation: Monitoring power ﬂows and voltages
in a power system is important in maintaining system reli-
ability. To ensure that a power system continues to operate
even when some components fail, power engineers use meters
to monitor system components and report their readings to
the control center, which estimates the state of power system
variables according to these meter measurements. Examples
of state variables include bus voltage angles and magnitudes.
The state estimation problem is to estimate power sys-
tem state variables x = (x1, x2, ..., xn)T based on the me-
ter measurements z = (z1, z2, ..., zm)T , where n and m are
positive integers and xi, zj ∈ R for i = 1, 2, ..., n and j =
1, 2, ..., m [31]. More precisely, assuming e = (e1, e2, ..., em)T
with ej ∈ R, j = 1, 2, ..., m, are measurement errors, the
state variables are related to the measurements through the
following model
z = h(x) + e,
(1)
where h(x) = (h1(x1, x2, ..., xn), ..., hm(x1, x2, ..., xn))T and
hi(x1, x2, ..., xn) is a function of x1, x2, ..., xn. The state
estimation problem is to ﬁnd an estimate ˆx of x that is the
best ﬁt of the measurement z according to Equation (1).
For state estimation using the DC power ﬂow model, Equa-
tion (1) can be represented by a linear regression model
z = Hx + e,
(2)
where H = (hi,j)m×n. Three statistical estimation crite-
ria are commonly used in state estimation: the maximum
likelihood criterion, the weighted least-square criterion, and
the minimum variance criterion [31]. When meter error is
assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean, these
criteria lead to an identical estimator with the following ma-
trix solution

Bad Measurement Detection: Bad measurements may
be introduced due to various reasons such as meter fail-
ures and malicious attacks. Techniques for bad measure-
ments detection have been developed to protect state es-
timation [23, 31]. Intuitively, normal sensor measurements
usually give an estimate of the state variables close to their
actual values, while abnormal ones may “move” the esti-
mated state variables away from their true values. Thus,
there is usually “inconsistency” among the good and the bad
measurements. Power systems researchers proposed to cal-
culate the measurement residual z − Hˆx (i.e., the diﬀerence
between the vector of observed measurements and the vector
of estimated measurements), and use its L2-norm (cid:4)z − Hˆx(cid:4)
to detect the presence of bad measurements. Speciﬁcally,
(cid:4)z − Hˆx(cid:4) is compared with a threshold τ , and the presence
of bad measurements is assumed if (cid:4)z − Hˆx(cid:4) > τ .
The selection of τ is a key issue. Assume that all the
state variables are mutually independent and the meter er-
rors follow the normal distribution. It can be mathemati-
cally shown that (cid:4)z − Hˆx(cid:4)2, denoted L(x), follows a χ2(v)-
distribution, where v = m − n is the degree of freedom. Ac-
cording to [31], τ can be determined through a hypothesis
test with a signiﬁcance level α. In other words, the probabil-
ity that L(x) ≥ τ 2 is equal to α. Thus, L(x) ≥ τ 2 indicates
the presence of bad measurements, with the probability of
a false alarm being α.
2.1 Related Work
Many researchers have considered the problem of bad mea-
surements detection and identiﬁcation in power systems (e.g.,
[4,6,7,9,10,12,21–25,28,29,32–36]). Early power system re-
searchers realized the existence of bad measurements and
observed that a bad measurement usually led to large nor-
malized measurement residual. After the presence of bad
measurements is detected, they mark the measurement hav-
ing the largest normalized residual as the suspect and re-
move it [9, 10, 24, 28, 29, 32–34]. For example, Schweppe et
al. [29] ﬁlter one measurement having the largest normal-
ized residual at each loop, and then rerun the same process
on the reduced measurement set until the detection test is
passed. Handschin et al. [9] proposed a grouped residual
search strategy that can remove all suspected bad measure-
ments at one time.
It was found that the largest normalized residual criterion
only worked well for independent, non-correlated bad mea-
surements called non-interacting bad measurements [21, 23,
25]. In practice, there exist correlated bad measurements,
which make the normalized residual of a good measurement
the largest. Such bad measurements are called interacting
bad measurements. The largest normalized residual method
does not work satisfactorily in dealing with interacting bad
measurements. To address this problem, Hypothesis Testing
Identiﬁcation (HTI) [21] and Combinatorial Optimization
Identiﬁcation (COI) [4, 12, 25] were developed. HTI selects
a set of suspected bad measurements according to their nor-
malized residuals, and then decides whether an individual
suspected measurement is good or bad through hypothesis
testing. COI uses the framework from the decision theory
