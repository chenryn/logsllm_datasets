I reported this bug on the 3.x series and it was never addressed.
The community had a workaround by calling the callback via setTimeout.
#13519
... but now the workaround is dead in the 4.x.x series.
The devs NEED to take this seriously. This just killed my app and if it's not
fixed I might as well shut down the entire project.
I tried to refactor my code to call the callback without setTimeout and that
doesn't fix the problem.
Can someone from the Electron team prioritize this or let me know of a way to
prioritize this. This is **critical** for may app...
