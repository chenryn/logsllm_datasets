Looking at wells (http://getbootstrap.com/components/#wells) and contextual
text and backgrounds (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes) and noticed
these are not complementing each other.
A `.well` will make the element ignore the text and background provided by the
contextual classes, so
        ...
is no different from
        ...
I propose that either the fact that `.well` will override the contextual
classes be documented, or (preferably) `.well` and the contextual classes will
complement each other.
