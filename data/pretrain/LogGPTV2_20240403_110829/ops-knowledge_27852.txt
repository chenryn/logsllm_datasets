User: I'm generating an epydoc for a library of code, and there are a few testing files scattered throughout that I'd like to not include.  I could use the --exclude generation option and rename the files, but I'm wondering if there's anything I can add to the files themselves that will be interpreted by epydoc as a command not to include/parse that file.
Assistant: It would seem the answer to this question is no.  If you want to exclude an element, the only option is to use 

--exclude=PATTERN   

Which excludes modules whose dotted name matches the regular expression PATTERN
