4.4 Practical Implications
Now, we discuss the practical implications of our result. Speci(cid:12)cally, we highlight the implications for
the EPID scheme [13, 5], which is based on Mechanism 6 and is standardized as Mechanism 3 in the
ISO/IEC 20008-2 [2]. In fact, the EPID scheme has a lot in common with Mechanism 6, especially, their
joining protocols are almost identical.5
Firstly, our security analysis helps to understand the security of the EPID scheme. As we showed in
Section 3, there exists an attack against the anonymity of Mechanism 6 in the BSZ model. Therefore, it
is not sure that the EPID scheme is secure since its security relies on that of Mechanism 6. Speci(cid:12)cally,
there are concerns that the weakness of Mechanism 6 might be exploited to frame the EPID scheme.
However, fortunately our attack does not threaten the EPID scheme for operational reasons. Concretely,
since the CPA security is considered in the security model of the EPID scheme [13] (i.e., an adversary
is not allowed to access the opening oracle in this model), our attack does not work. In addition, due to
our security analysis of Mechanism 6, it seems that the EPID scheme is secure in the proposed security
model [13]. More precisely, our result (speci(cid:12)cally, Theorem 4.1) implies that Mechanism 6 is secure in
the CPA setting since an adversary cannot generate a related query in this setting. Therefore, the EPID
scheme also seems to be secure in the CPA setting.
Secondly, our result is a (cid:12)rst step to use the EPID scheme in a more demanding situation. Even if
the EPID scheme is secure in the CPA setting, there remains a possibility of potential attacks such as
Bleichenbacher’s attack [12]. Such attacks have been eﬃciently implemented (e.g., [9, 31]), especially the
attacks proposed by Swami [31] is a type of CCA attacks for Intel SGX, which employs the EPID scheme.
Since Intel SGX is widely used in many kinds of cryptographic systems [29, 30, 21, 8, 20, 28], it might
be possible that the vulnerability of Mechanism 6 is exploited for some deployed system. Therefore, to
achieve a higher security level, it is required that the EPID scheme is secure in the CCA setting. Due to
our analysis of the rigorous security, we see that Mechanism 6 is CCA secure under the condition that
the issuer does not join the attack. (Also, we provide a patched scheme satisfying CCA security in the
next section.) Thus, it seems that the EPID scheme could also achieve CCA security if it is used under
limited conditions (or it is constructed from the patched scheme instead of Mechanism 6). Although we
5Roughly, the values h1, h2, A, x, y, and f in the EPID scheme [13] correspond to the values H, K, A, yi, zi, and xi
in Mechanism 6 (showed in Figure 1), respectively.

need a more detailed discussion, we hope that we have provided approaches to use the EPID scheme in
the CCA setting.
5 Patched Scheme
In this section, we give a patch of Mechanism 6. As we explained before, the (cid:13)aw of Mechanism 6 is that
the underlying proof system does not satisfy simulation soundness. More precisely, for commitments
fRigi2[1;4] and a challenge value c, the elements (cid:27)x and (cid:27)r are uniquely determined but the other
elements (cid:27)y, (cid:27)(cid:14), and (cid:27)q are redundant. By this redundancy, the adversary can re-randomize the challenge
signature, and then Mechanism 6 can be broken.
To achieve that Mechanism 6 satis(cid:12)es anonymity in the BSZ model, we need to remove this redun-
dancy. A simple way to do this is to make the underlying proof system have unique responses [19, 32]
(de(cid:12)ned as \strict soundness" in the later paper). That is, for commitments fRigi and a challenge value
c, there exists only one valid proof. By doing so, the adversary cannot re-randomize a signature since
there is no candidate of such a signature. However, when we employ the proof system with unique re-
sponses, the resulting group signature scheme becomes ineﬃcient. This is because many equations need
to be proved/veri(cid:12)ed in such a proof system, and then the signature size and the signing/verifying costs
in the group signature scheme also increase.
element (cid:27)q is (cid:12)xed, possible cases of related queries are \e(cid:27)y ̸= (cid:27)
\e(cid:27)y = (cid:27)
In the proposed patched scheme, we reduce the redundancy to prevent re-randomizing the signature.
Concretely, we add an equation to prove about the witness q and also (cid:12)x the element (cid:27)q. That is, the
parts (cid:27)y and (cid:27)(cid:14) are still redundant also in the patched scheme. However, from the analysis of related
queries in Section 4.2, we see that it is hard to generate related queries in such a situation. When the

(b). As we proved, the probability that the adversary generates the related queries in Type (a) and (b)
is negligible. Therefore, the adversary cannot re-randomize a signature when the element (cid:27)q is (cid:12)xed.

The description of the patched scheme is given in Figure 2. The changed parts from Mechanism 6 are
underlined. In the patched scheme, only the signing and the veri(cid:12)cation algorithms are changed whereas
the other algorithms (GKg, UKg, Join/Issue, Open, and Judge) are the same as those of Mechanism 6.
q is added as a part of a signature, and a signer also
Concretely, to (cid:12)x the value (cid:27)q, the element T0 = G1
proves this equation when generating a signature.
One concern is that the signer’s information may leak by adding a new element to a signature. In
Mechanism 6, the randomness q 2 Zp is used to mask the certi(cid:12)cate Ai such that T1 = Ai (cid:1) K q. Thus,
the tuple (T0; T1) is an ElGamal encryption of a certi(cid:12)cate Ai. Since Type II pairing is considered, the
XDH assumption holds. Thus, the ElGamal scheme is secure in G1, and then the additional element T0
does not leak the signer’s information.

hidden from the adversary by the security of the encryption schemes and the zero-knowledge property
of the underlying proof system. Therefore as in Theorem 4.1, we can easily see that the patched scheme
satis(cid:12)es anonymity if the adversary does not generate a related query.
In the patched scheme, we have four cases of a related query described in Table 2 since the element (cid:27)q
is (cid:12)xed. For each type of related queries, we see that it is eliminated from the analysis in Section 4.2. The
probability that an adversary generates a related query in Type (a) is negligible if the DL assumption
holds, and the probabilities to generate a related query in Type (b) and (c) are at most 1=p and 2=p,
respectively. Thus, we can say that the patched scheme satis(cid:12)es anonymity.
