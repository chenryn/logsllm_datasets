title:blackhat:eu-21 Clocking On
A nerd's eye view of time and timekeeping...Moves are finally afoot to secure time! Well, to secure what we consider to be the current time. Or, to be more specific, to secure how we distribute what we consider to be the consensus of what is the "current" time. And by "we" I mean The Internet. And by "current time" I mean time measured by Atomic Clocks, accurate to within 1 second every 100 million years. Or thereabouts.So that's nice...But what does that actually mean?Why do I care?Is it enough?Is an 0-day that skews time still an 0-day or does it disappear up its own paradox?Only time will tell...
