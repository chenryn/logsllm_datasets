To view the resulting URL, please see the Plunker and select the option "_Launch the preview in a separate window_."

- The configuration `['/Parent', {}, 'Child']` results in a runtime error during the application start.
- The configuration `['/Parent2', {par:1, w:0, x:1}, 'Child2', {id:2, y:10, z:11}]` generates the following URL: `#/parent2/1/child2/2;y=10;z=11?w=0&x=1`. However, there is some inconsistency in the processing of additional parent-child attributes. The expected URL format should be `#/parent2/1/child2/2?y=10&z=11&w=0&x=1`.

This discrepancy indicates that the handling of extra parameters needs to be reviewed and corrected.
