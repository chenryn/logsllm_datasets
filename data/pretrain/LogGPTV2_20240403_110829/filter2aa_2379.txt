#### Introduction
Motorola is the leading manufacturer of trunked radio systems used by public safety agencies in the United States. This article provides an overview of the different Motorola systems and will delve into each one in more detail in subsequent months.

#### Types of Motorola Systems
There are four main types of Motorola systems:
- **Type I**
- **Type II**
- **Type I/II Hybrids**
- **ASTRO**

Except for ASTRO, voice transmissions in these systems are analog, making them accessible on a regular scanner.

#### Motorola Type I
- **Frequency Range:** Operates only in the 800 MHz range.
- **Marketing Term:** "Privacy Plus" was initially a marketing term for Type I systems.
- **Talk Groups:** In Type I systems, talk groups are assigned through digital codes rather than separate frequencies. For example, a city might have the police, fire, and sanitation departments as distinct talk groups.
- **Hierarchy:** 
  - **Fleets:** A group of subfleets (e.g., police or fire department).
  - **Subfleets:** Individual radio identifiers within a fleet (e.g., patrol, detective, traffic).
  - **Radio Identifiers:** Unique identifiers for each radio.
- **Addressing:** Radios have a digital address stored in a "code plug." Addresses are divided into eight blocks, each with a "size code" that determines the number of fleets, subfleets, and individual radio identifiers it can support.

#### Example: Scanning Chicago's O'Hare Airport
- **Frequencies:** 856.7625 MHz, 857.7625 MHz, 858.7625 MHz, 859.7125 MHz, 859.7625 MHz, 860.7125 MHz, 860.7625 MHz.
- **Fleet Map:** E1P4, which supports one fleet with sixteen subfleets and 1024 unique radio identifiers.
- **Subfleet Assignments:**
  - Dispatch, Trades, Electrical, HR, Construction, Parking, Ground Transportation, F 100, Police, Fire, Operations, Security, Emergency, Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting, Accident Control.

#### Motorola Type II
- **Trademark:** "SmartNet"
- **Frequency Bands:** 800 MHz, 900 MHz, VHF, UHF
- **Features:** Emergency signaling, enhanced security, remote monitoring, flexible grouping options.
- **Channels and Talk Groups:** Up to 28 radio channels and 4000 talk groups.
- **Addressing:** Uses two types of addresses:
  - **Radio Identifier:** Unique identifier for each radio.
  - **Talkgroup Codes:** Hexadecimal codes for each talk group.
- **Example: Scanning Disneyland**
  - **Reported Frequencies:** 861.5125 MHz, 862.5125 MHz, 863.5125 MHz, 864.5125 MHz, 865.5125 MHz.
  - **Likely Frequencies:** 938.3875 MHz, 938.4000 MHz, 938.4375 MHz, 938.4500 MHz, 938.4625 MHz, 938.4750 MHz, 938.4875 MHz, 938.5000 MHz.
  - **Interconnection:** Can be linked to form a "SmartZone" with up to 48 sites interconnected via microwave or landline links.

#### Motorola Type I/II Hybrid
- **Purpose:** Used by organizations transitioning from Type I to Type II while still using old equipment.
- **Complexity:** Can be confusing for scanner listeners as signals may contain both talkgroups and fleet/subfleet addresses.
- **Example: Scanning Arlington, Texas**
  - **Frequencies:** 856.4875 MHz, 856.7125 MHz, 857.4875 MHz, 857.7125 MHz, 858.4875 MHz, 858.7125 MHz, 859.4875 MHz, 859.7125 MHz, 860.4875 MHz, 860.7125 MHz.
  - **Fleet Map:** Supports various fleets and subfleets for the fire and police departments, as well as other services and the University of Texas at Arlington.

#### Motorola ASTRO
- **Trademark:** Digital voice radios.
- **Concept:** Similar to Type II but with digital voice transmission, making it inaccessible to current scanners.
- **Standards:** Compliant with APCO Project 25, designed for public safety interoperability.
- **Customers:** Large municipalities and statewide systems, such as Cleveland, San Diego County, Florida, Massachusetts, and Michigan.
- **Example: Baltimore, Maryland**
  - **System:** 28 channels, nine simulcast sites, over 5,000 mobile and portable radios.
- **Example: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**
  - **Contract:** $51 million for two 15-channel ASTRO systems, expected to operate over 6,000 radios.
