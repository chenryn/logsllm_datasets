I can't see any mention of HMR in the Devtools documentation, however; now
that `react-hot-loader` has become obsolete (and with it, the `require("react-
hot-loader/root").hot` method), how should we set up apps for HMR in:
  * React DOM apps
  * React Native apps
  * React custom renderer apps
I'd be particularly interested in a migration guide specifically for anyone
who's already set up HMR via `react-hot-loader`.
Also, for HMR, does it matter whether we're using the standalone Devtools or
the browser-extension Devtools?
