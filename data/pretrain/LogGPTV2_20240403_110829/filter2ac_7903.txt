ATT&CK ID:T0840
ATT&CK Technique Name:Network Connection Enumeration
Adversaries may perform network connection enumeration to discover information about device communication patterns. If an adversary can inspect the state of a network connection with tools, such as Netstat, in conjunction with System Firmware, then they can determine the role of certain devices on the network  . The adversary can also use Network Sniffing to watch network traffic for details about the source, destination, protocol, and content.
