## Abstract
In traditional ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) schemes, the access structure, also known as the ciphertext policy, is explicitly sent along with the ciphertext. This allows anyone who obtains the ciphertext to know the associated access structure. In certain applications, access structures contain sensitive information and must be protected from everyone except the users whose private key attributes satisfy the access structure.

In this paper, we propose a new model for CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures. In our model, each attribute consists of two parts: an attribute name and its value. If a user's private key attributes do not satisfy the access structure associated with a ciphertext, the specific attribute values in the access structure are hidden, while other information about the access structure remains public.

Based on the CP-ABE scheme proposed by Lewko et al. [14], we present an efficient construction of CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures. Compared to previous works in this field, our construction is more flexible and expressive and is proven fully secure in the standard model.

Many distributed applications require complex access-control mechanisms where access decisions depend on attributes of protected data and access control policies assigned to users. Data owners can establish specific access control policies based on users' attributes. Sahai and Waters [26] introduced the concept of attribute-based encryption (ABE) to address this issue. ABE enables public key-based one-to-many encryption and is envisioned as a promising cryptographic primitive for realizing scalable and fine-grained access control systems.

There are two types of ABE schemes: key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) and ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE). This paper focuses on the latter.

In a CP-ABE scheme, every ciphertext is associated with an access structure on attributes, and every user's secret key is associated with a set of attributes. A user can decrypt a ciphertext only if the set of attributes associated with their private key satisfies the access structure associated with the ciphertext. In traditional CP-ABE schemes, the access structure is sent along with the ciphertext, making it visible to anyone who obtains the ciphertext. This property is not suitable for applications where access policies contain sensitive information.

Consider a cloud data storage scenario where a data owner intends to outsource data to the cloud and wants to establish specific access control policies. The data owner encrypts the data to prevent leakage of sensitive information to the cloud service provider. Figure 1 depicts the system architecture of a cloud storage for healthcare information. In healthcare, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that medical data be kept confidential against cloud storage servers. Suppose a data owner outsources a medical record to the cloud and specifies that the record can only be accessed by a cardiologist at University Park Hospital or by a patient with social security number 123-45-6789. If the data owner uses a traditional CP-ABE scheme, the cloud service provider and others can infer the access policy, which is unacceptable.

One can construct CP-ABE with hidden access structures from attribute-hiding Inner-product Predicate Encryption (IPE) [12]. However, using inner product predicates for CP-ABE can cause a superpolynomial blowup in size for arbitrary access structures, making it extremely inefficient. Therefore, we investigate how to trade off fully hidden access structures for the efficiency of CP-ABE.

### 1.1 Our Contributions
In many applications, specific attribute values carry more sensitive information than generic attribute names. This observation motivates us to consider a new model of CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures. In this model, each attribute includes two parts: an attribute name and its value. If a user's private key attributes do not satisfy the access structure associated with a ciphertext, the attribute values in the access structure are hidden, while other information, such as attribute names, remains public. For example, if the data owner uses a CP-ABE scheme under this new model to encrypt a medical record, anyone obtaining the ciphertext only knows the following information about the access policy:
- SS#: * OR (Affiliation: * AND Occupation: *)
The sensitive attribute values, such as "123-45-6789," "University Park Hospital," and "Cardiologist," are hidden from the public. Figure 2 shows an example of a partially hidden access structure.

Based on the CP-ABE scheme proposed by Lewko et al. [14], we present an efficient construction of CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures. Our scheme can handle any access structure that can be expressed as a Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS), and its ciphertext size scales linearly with the complexity of the access structure. We prove that the proposed scheme is fully secure in the standard model using the dual system encryption methodology [29].

Our scheme is more flexible and expressive compared to previous works [22, 19, 13] on CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures, which only support restricted access structures. Table 1 provides an overview comparing our CP-ABE scheme to existing ones, showing that our scheme is superior in handling the most expressive access structures and is fully secure in the standard model. Therefore, our proposed scheme is most suitable for outsourcing data with sensitive attribute values in access control policies.

### 1.2 Related Work
We summarize the major related works in the areas of ABE, KP-ABE, PE, CP-ABE, CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures, and dual system encryption technology.

#### Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE)
Sahai and Waters [26] introduced ABE as an application of their fuzzy identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme, where both ciphertexts and secret keys are associated with sets of attributes. Decryption is enabled if the attribute sets overlap by at least a fixed threshold value.

#### Key-Policy ABE (KP-ABE)
Goyal et al. [11] formulated two complementary forms of ABE: KP-ABE and CP-ABE. In a KP-ABE scheme, decryption keys are associated with access structures, while ciphertexts are associated with sets of attributes. Goyal et al. [11] presented the first KP-ABE supporting monotonic access structures. Ostrovsky et al. [25] presented a KP-ABE system that supports non-monotone formulas in key policies. Lewko and Waters [18] proposed an unbounded KP-ABE scheme.

#### Predicate Encryption (PE)
Katz et al. [12] introduced the notion of PE and proposed the first inner-product PE. Shi and Waters [28] presented a delegation mechanism for a class of PE. Okamota and Takashima [23] presented a hierarchical delegation mechanism for an inner-product PE scheme. Shen et al. [27] introduced predicate privacy and proposed a symmetric-key inner-product PE. Lweko et al. [14] proposed the first fully secure inner-product PE. Okamota and Takashima [24] presented a fully secure PE for a wide class of admissible predicates.

#### Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE)
Bethencourt et al. [2] proposed the first CP-ABE construction, which is secure under the generic group model. Cheung and Newport [9] proposed a CP-ABE scheme secure under the standard model but restricted to AND of different attributes. Secure and expressive CP-ABE schemes [30, 14] were later proposed. CP-ABE schemes with multiple authorities were studied in [21, 17].

#### CP-ABE with Partially Hidden Access Structures
Nishide et al. [22] introduced the notion of CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures, where admissible access structures are expressed as AND gates on multi-valued attributes with wildcards. Li et al. [19] studied user accountability. These schemes are selectively secure. Lai et al. [13] proposed a fully secure CP-ABE scheme with partially hidden access structures but supported restricted access structures. Our proposed scheme is fully secure and more flexible and expressive.

#### Dual System Encryption Methodology
Waters [29] introduced the dual system encryption methodology, which has been used to obtain constructions of fully secure (H)IBE from simple assumptions [29], fully secure (H)IBE with short ciphertexts [16], fully secure (H)IBE and ABE with leakage resilience [15], and fully secure ABE and inner-product PE [14, 24].

### 1.3 Organization
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review standard notations and cryptographic definitions. In Section 3, we describe the security model for CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures and propose a concrete construction. Details of the security proofs are given in the Appendix. We state our conclusion in Section 4.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1 Standard Notations
- \( S \): A set
- \( s \xleftarrow{\$} S \): Picking an element \( s \) uniformly at random from \( S \)
- \( \mathbb{N} \): The set of natural numbers
- \( 1^\lambda \): A string of \( \lambda \) ones
- \( z \leftarrow A(x, y, \ldots) \): Running an algorithm \( A \) with inputs \( (x, y, \ldots) \) and output \( z \)
- A function \( f(\lambda) \) is negligible if for every \( c > 0 \), there exists \( \lambda_c \) such that \( f(\lambda) < \frac{1}{\lambda^c} \).

### 2.2 Access Structures
**Definition 1 (Access Structure [1])**:
Let \( \{P_1, \ldots, P_n\} \) be a set of parties. A collection \( A \subseteq 2^{\{P_1, \ldots, P_n\}} \) is monotone if for all \( B, C \): if \( B \in A \) and \( B \subseteq C \), then \( C \in A \). An access structure (respectively, monotone access structure) is a collection (respectively, monotone collection) \( A \) of non-empty subsets of \( \{P_1, \ldots, P_n\} \), i.e., \( A \subseteq 2^{\{P_1, \ldots, P_n\}} \setminus \{\emptyset\} \). The sets in \( A \) are called authorized sets, and the sets not in \( A \) are called unauthorized sets.

In our context, attributes play the role of parties, and we restrict our attention to monotone access structures. It is possible to (inefficiently) realize general access structures using our techniques by treating the negation of an attribute as a separate attribute.

### 2.3 Linear Secret Sharing Schemes
**Definition 2 (Linear Secret-Sharing Schemes [1])**:
A secret sharing scheme \( \Pi \) over a set of parties \( P \) is called linear (over \( \mathbb{Z}_p \)) if:
1. The shares for each party form a vector over \( \mathbb{Z}_p \).
2. There exists a matrix \( A \) with \( \ell \) rows and \( n \) columns, called the share-generating matrix for \( \Pi \). For all \( i = 1, \ldots, \ell \), the \( i \)-th row of \( A \) is labeled by a party \( \rho(i) \) (where \( \rho \) is a function from \( \{1, \ldots, \ell\} \) to \( P \)). When we consider the column vector \( v = (s, r_2, \ldots, r_n) \), where \( s \in \mathbb{Z}_p \) is the secret to be shared, and \( r_2, \ldots, r_n \in \mathbb{Z}_p \) are randomly chosen, then \( Av \) is the vector of \( \ell \) shares of the secret \( s \) according to \( \Pi \). The share \( (Av)_i \) belongs to party \( \rho(i) \).

It is shown in [1] that every linear secret-sharing scheme according to the above definition also enjoys the linear reconstruction property. Suppose that \( \Pi \) is an LSSS for the access structure \( A \). Let \( S \in A \) be any authorized set, and let \( I \subset \{1, \ldots, \ell\} \) be defined as \( I = \{i \mid \rho(i) \in S\} \). Then there exist constants \( \{\omega_i \in \mathbb{Z}_p\}_{i \in I} \) such that, if \( \{\lambda_i\} \) are valid shares of any secret \( s \) according to \( \Pi \), then \( \sum_{i \in I} \omega_i \lambda_i = s \). Let \( A_i \) denote the \( i \)-th row of \( A \); then \( \sum_{i \in I} \omega_i A_i = (1, 0, \ldots, 0) \). These constants \( \{\omega_i\} \) can be found in time polynomial in the size of the share-generation matrix \( A \) [1]. Note that, for unauthorized sets, no such constants \( \{\omega_i\} \) exist.

**Boolean Formulas**: Access structures might also be described in terms of monotonic boolean formulas. Using standard techniques [1], one can convert any monotonic boolean formula into an LSSS representation. We can represent the boolean formula as an access tree. An access tree of \( \ell \) nodes will result in an LSSS matrix of \( \ell \) rows. We refer the reader to the appendix of [17] for a discussion on how to perform this conversion.

### 2.4 Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption
A CP-ABE scheme consists of the following four algorithms:

- **Setup(1Î», U)**: Takes as input a security parameter \( \lambda \) and the attribute universe description \( U \). It outputs the public parameters \( PK \) and a master secret key \( MSK \).
- **KeyGen(PK, MSK, S)**: Takes as input the public parameters \( PK \), the master secret key \( MSK \), and a set of attributes \( S \). It outputs a secret key \( SK_S \).
- **Encrypt(PK, M, A)**: Takes as input the public parameters \( PK \), a message \( M \), and an access structure \( A \). It outputs a ciphertext \( CT \).
- **Decrypt(PK, SK, CT)**: Takes as input the public parameters \( PK \), a secret key \( SK \), and a ciphertext \( CT \). It outputs the message \( M \) if the attributes in \( SK \) satisfy the access structure \( A \) in \( CT \).

This concludes the preliminaries section. The next section will delve into the security model and the construction of our CP-ABE scheme with partially hidden access structures.
