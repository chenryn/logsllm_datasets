ABSTRACT
In a traditional ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption
(CP-ABE) scheme, an access structure, also refereed to as
ciphertext-policy, is sent along with a ciphertext explicitly,
and anyone who obtains a ciphertext can know the access
structure associated with the ciphertext. In certain appli-
cations, access structures contain sensitive information and
must be protected from everyone except the users whose
private key attributes satisfy the access structures.
In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a new model for CP-ABE
with partially hidden access structures. In our model, each
attribute consists of two parts: an attribute name and its
value; if the private key attributes of a user do not satisfy
the access structure associated with a ciphertext, the speciﬁc
attribute values of the access structure are hidden, while
other information about the access structure is public.
Based on the CP-ABE scheme proposed by Lewko et al.
[14] recently, we then present an eﬃcient construction of CP-
ABE with partially hidden access structures. Compared to
previous works in this ﬁeld, our construction is more ﬂexible
and expressive and is proven fully secure in the standard
model.

Many distributed applications require complex access- con-
trol mechanisms, where access decisions depend on attributes
of protected data and access control policies assigned to
users, or data owners can establish speciﬁc access control
policies on who can decrypt the protected data based on
users’ attributes. Sahai and Waters [26] addressed this is-
sue by introducing the concept of attribute-based encryption
(ABE). ABE enables public key based one-to-many encryp-
tion and is envisioned as a promising cryptographic primitive
for realizing scalable and ﬁne-grained access control systems.
There are two kinds of ABE schemes [11], key-policy ABE
(KP-ABE) and ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) schemes.
This paper, our concern is on the latter.
In a CP-ABE scheme [2], every ciphertext is associated
with an access structure on attributes, and every user’s se-
cret key is associated with a set of attributes. A user will
be able to decrypt a ciphertext only if the set of attributes
associated with the user’s private key satisﬁes the access
structure associated with the ciphertext. In traditional CP-
ABE schemes [2, 9, 14, 30], an access structure is sent along
with a ciphertext explicitly; therefore anyone who obtains
the ciphertext is able to know the associated access struc-
ture. However, this property is not appropriate for certain
applications where access policies contain sensitive informa-
tion.
Consider the following cloud data storage scenario where
a data owner intends to outsource his data to the cloud and
wants to establish speciﬁc access control policies on who can
access the data. Before outsourcing his data, the data owner
encrypts it in order to prevent leakage of sensitive informa-
tion to the cloud service provider since the cloud is usually
operated by commercial ﬁrms outside of the data owner’s
trusted domain. Figure 1 depicts the system architecture of
a cloud storage for healthcare information. In healthcare,
it must meet the requirements of Health Insurance Porta-
bility and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for any use or dis-
closure of protected healthcare information; therefore, there
is no option but to keep medical data conﬁdential against
cloud storage servers. Suppose that a data owner intends to
outsource a medical record to the cloud and speciﬁes that
the medical record can only be accessed by a cardiologist
in University Park Hospital or by a patient with social se-
curity number 123-45-6789. The data owner encrypts the
record using a CP-ABE scheme in order to keep it conﬁden-
tial from the cloud service provider. If the data owner uses a
traditional CP-ABE scheme to encrypt the medical record,
everyone including the cloud service provider is able to know
the access policy associated with the ciphertext, and can in-

suﬀers from a heart problem. This is clearly not acceptable
and shows the necessity of hiding the access policies from
prying eyes in certain applications.
One can construct CP-ABE with hidden access structures
from attribute-hiding Inner-product Predicate Encryption
(IPE) [12]. Predicate Encryption (PE) was presented by
Katz, Sahai and Waters [12] as a generalized (ﬁne-grained)
notion of encryption that covers CP-ABE. In a PE scheme,
secret keys correspond to predicates and ciphertexts are as-
sociated with a set of attributes; a secret key SKf corre-
sponding to a predicate f can be used to decrypt a ci-
phertext associated with an attribute set I if and only if
f (I) = 1. Katz, Sahai, and Waters [12] also introduced
the idea of attribute-hiding, a security notion for PE that
is stronger than the basic security requirement of payload-
hiding. Roughly speaking, attribute-hiding requires that a
ciphertext conceal the associated attributes as well as the
plaintext, while payload-hiding only requires that a cipher-
text conceal the plaintext. The special case of inner product
predicates is obtained by having each attribute correspond
to a vector ⃗x and each predicate f⃗v correspond to a vector
⃗v, where f⃗v(⃗x) = 1 iﬀ ⃗x · ⃗v = 0. (⃗x · ⃗v denotes the standard
inner-product.)
As mentioned in [14], in order to use inner product predi-
cates for CP-ABE, access structures must be written in CNF
or DNF form, which can cause a superpolynomial blowup in
size for arbitrary access structures. Since it is extremely in-
eﬃcient to implement CP-ABE schemes with fully hidden
access structures derived from attribute-hiding IPE, we in-
vestigate how to trade oﬀ fully hidden access structures for
the eﬃciency of CP-ABE.
1.1 Our Contributions
In many applications, speciﬁc attribute values carry much
more sensitive information than the generic attribute names.
In Figure 1, “Cardiologist” and “123-45-6789” are more sen-
sitive than “Occupation” and “SS#”, respectively. This ob-
servation motivates us to consider a new model of CP-ABE
with partially hidden access structures. In this model, each
attribute includes two parts: attribute name and its value;
if the set of attributes associated with a user’s private key
does not satisfy the access structure associated with a ci-
phertext, attribute values in the access structure are hidden,
while other information, such as attribute names, about the
access structure is public. In the above-mentioned example,
Figure 2: An access structure (a) and the corre-
sponding partially hidden access structure (b)
if the data owner uses a CP-ABE scheme under this new
model to encrypt his medical record, anyone obtaining the
ciphertext only knows the following information about the
access policy:
SS# : ∗ OR (Aﬃliation : ∗ AND Occupation : ∗),
while the sensitive attribute values, such as“123-45-6789”,
“University Park Hospital” and “Cardiologist”, are hidden
from the public. Figure 2 shows graphically this example of
partially hidden access structure.
Based on the CP-ABE scheme proposed by Lewko et al.
[14] recently, we present an eﬃcient construction of CP-
ABE with partially hidden access structures. In a CP-ABE
scheme, if the access structure associated with a ciphertext
is fully hidden, a user is not able to know which attribute
set satisﬁes the access structure, and this makes decryption
diﬃcult. However, in the proposed CP-ABE with partially
hidden access structures, we avoid the problem by adding
some redundant components to a ciphertext, where if the
private key attributes of a user satisfy the access structure
associated with the ciphertext, the user is able to decide
which attribute set satisﬁes the access structure using the
redundant components of the ciphertext. Our scheme can
handle any access structure that can be expressed as a Lin-
ear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS), and its ciphertext size
scales linearly with the complexity of the access structure.
We prove that the proposed scheme is fully secure in the
standard model using the dual system encryption method-
ology in [29].
There are a few other works [22, 19, 13] on CP-ABE with
partially hidden access structures. However, their schemes
only support restricted access structures, which can be ex-
pressed as AND gates on multi-valued attributes with wild-
cards. Compared to these schemes, our scheme is more ﬂex-
ible and expressive. An overview comparing our CP-ABE
scheme to those of other CP-ABE schemes with hidden ac-
cess structures is given in Table 1. The table shows that
our scheme is superior to the existing ones in the area of
CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures since it can
handle the most expressive access structures and is fully se-
cure in the standard model. Therefore, our proposed scheme
is most suitable for outsourcing data with sensitive attribute
values in access control policies.

of their fuzzy identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme [26],
where both ciphertexts and secret keys are associated with
sets of attributes. The decryption of a ciphertext is enabled
if and only if the attribute set for the ciphertext and the
attribute set for the secret key overlap by at least a ﬁxed
threshold value d.
KP-ABE. Goyal et al.
[11] formulated two complimentary
forms of ABE: KP-ABE and CP-ABE. In a CP-ABE scheme,
decryption keys are associated with sets of attributes and
ciphertexts are associated with access structures. In a KP-
ABE scheme, the situation is reversed: decryption keys are
associated with access structures while ciphertexts are asso-
ciated with sets of attributes. There exists a general method
to transform KP-ABE to CP-ABE [10].
In terms of the
expressive power of access structures, Goyal et al. [11] pre-
sented the ﬁrst KP-ABE supporting monotonic access struc-
tures. To enable more ﬂexible access control policy, Os-
trovsky et al.
[25] presented a KP-ABE system that sup-
ports the expression of non-monotone formulas in key poli-
cies. The problem of building KP-ABE systems with mul-
tiple authorities was investigated in [7, 20, 8]. Recently,
Lewko and Waters [18] proposed a KP-ABE scheme which
is “unbounded” in the sense that the public parameters do
not impose additional limitations on the functionality of the
scheme.
Predicate Encryption (PE). In this paragraph, we give a
brief introduction about the work on PE since CP-ABE can
be derived from inner-product PE. The notion of PE was
introduced by Katz et al. [12]. They also proposed the ﬁrst
inner-product PE. Shi and Waters [28] presented a delega-
tion mechanism for a class of PE, in which the admissible
predicates of the system are more limited than inner-product
predicates. Okamota and Takashima [23] presented a (hi-
erarchical) delegation mechanism for an inner-product PE
scheme. Shen et al.
[27] introduced a new security notion
of PE called predicate privacy and proposed a symmetric-
key inner-product PE, which achieves both plaintext privacy
and predicate privacy. These schemes were only proven se-
lectively secure. Lweko et al.
[14] proposed the ﬁrst fully
secure inner-product PE. Okamota and Takashima [24] pre-
sented a fully secure PE for a wide class of admissible predi-
cates, which are speciﬁed by non-monotone access structures
combined with inner-product predicates.
CP-ABE. The ﬁrst CP-ABE construction proposed by Bethen-
[2] is proven secure under the generic group
court et al.
model. Later, Cheung and Newport [9] proposed an CP-
ABE scheme that is secure under the standard model; how-
ever, the access structures in this scheme are restricted to
AND of diﬀerent attributes. Recently, secure and expressive
CP-ABE schemes [30, 14] were proposed. CP-ABE schemes
with multiple authorities were also studied in [21, 17].
CP-ABE with Partially Hidden Access Structures. The no-
tion of CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures was
introduced by Nishide et al.
[22], where the admissible ac-
cess structures are expressed as AND gates on multi-valued
attributes with wildcards. Li et al. [19] followed their work
and studied the problem of user accountability. All these
schemes are proven to be selectively secure only, which is a
weak security model analogous to the selective-ID model [5,
3] in IBE schemes. Recently, Lai et al. [13] proposed a fully
secure (cf.
selectively secure) CP-ABE scheme with par-
tially hidden access structures; however, their scheme only
supports restricted access structures as in [22, 19]. Moving
one step forward, we propose a fully secure CP-ABE scheme
with partially hidden access structures that can be expressed
as an LSSS, which is more ﬂexible and expressive than pre-
vious works [22, 19, 13].
Dual System Encryption Methodology. The dual system en-
cryption methodology, introduced by Waters in [29], will
be used in the security proofs of our construction. This
methodology has been leveraged to obtain constructions of
fully secure (H)IBE from simple assumptions [29], fully se-
cure (H)IBE with short ciphertexts [16], fully secure (H)IBE
and ABE with leakage resilience [15], fully secure ABE and
inner-product PE [14, 24].
1.3 Organization
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, we review some standard notations and cryptographic
deﬁnitions. In Section 3, we describe the security model for
CP-ABE with partially hidden access structures and propose
a concrete construction. Details of the security proofs of the
proposed construction are given in the Appendix. We state
our conclusion in Section 4.
2. PRELIMINARIES
If S is a set, then s $← S denotes the operation of picking
an element s uniformly at random from S. Let N denote
the set of natural numbers. If λ ∈ N then 1λ denotes the
string of λ ones. Let z ← A(x, y, . . .) denote the operation
of running an algorithm A with inputs (x, y, . . .) and output
z. A function f (λ) is negligible if for every c > 0 there exists
a λc such that f (λ)  λc.
2.1 Access Structures
(Access Structure [1]). Let {P1, . . . , Pn}
Definition 1
{P1,...,Pn}
be a set of parties. A collection A ⊆ 2
is monotone
if ∀B, C : if B ∈ A and B ⊆ C, then C ∈ A. An access
structure (respectively, monotone access structure) is a col-
lection (respectively, monotone collection) A of non-empty
subsets of {P1, . . . , Pn}, i.e., A ⊆ 2
{P1,...,Pn}\{∅}. The sets
in A are called authorized sets, and the sets not in A are
called unauthorized sets.
In our context, attributes play the role of parties and we
restrict our attention to monotone access structures. It is
possible to (ineﬃciently) realize general access structures us-
ing our techniques by treating the negation of an attribute
as a separate attribute.
2.2 Linear Secret Sharing Schemes
Our construction will employ linear secret-sharing schemes
(LSSS). We use the deﬁnition adapted from [1]:
Definition 2
(Linear Secret-Sharing Schemes). A
secret sharing scheme Π over a set of parties P is called lin-
ear (over Zp) if
1. The shares for each party form a vector over Zp.
2. There exists a matrix A with ℓ rows and n columns
called the share-generating matrix for Π. For all i =
1, . . . , ℓ, the ith row of A is labeled by a party ρ(i) (ρ
is a function from {1, . . . , ℓ} to P). When we consider
the column vector v = (s, r2, . . . , rn), where s ∈ Zp is
the secret to be shared, and r2, . . . , rn ∈ Zp are ran-
domly chosen, then Av is the vector of ℓ shares of the
secret s according to Π. The share (Av)i belongs to
party ρ(i).
It is shown in [1] that every linear secret-sharing scheme
according to the above deﬁnition also enjoys the linear re-
construction property, deﬁned as follows. Suppose that Π
is an LSSS for the access structure A. Let S ∈ A be any
authorized set, and let I ⊂ {1, . . . , ℓ} be deﬁned as I =
∑
{i|ρ(i) ∈ S}. Then there exist constants {ωi ∈ Zp}i∈I such
∑
that, if {λi} are valid shares of any secret s according to Π,
i∈I ωiλi = s. Let Ai denotes the ith row of A, we
then
i∈I ωiAi = (1, 0, . . . , 0). These constants {ωi} can be
have
found in time polynomial in the size of the share-generation
matrix A [1]. Note that, for unauthorized sets, no such con-
stants {ωi} exist.
Boolean Formulas Access structures might also be de-
scribed in terms of monotonic boolean formulas. Using stan-
dard techniques [1] one can convert any monotonic boolean
formula into an LSSS representation. We can represent the
boolean formula as an access tree. An access tree of ℓ nodes
will result in an LSSS matrix of ℓ rows. We refer the reader
to the appendix of [17] for a discussion on how to perform
this conversion.

tion
A CP-ABE scheme consists of the following four algo-
rithms:
Setup(1λ, U ) takes as input a security parameter λ and the
attribute universe description U . It outputs the public
parameters PK and a master secret key MSK.
KeyGen(PK, MSK,S) takes as input the public parameters
PK, the master secret key MSK and a set of attributes
S. It outputs a secret key SKS .
Encrypt(PK, M, A) takes as input the public parameters
