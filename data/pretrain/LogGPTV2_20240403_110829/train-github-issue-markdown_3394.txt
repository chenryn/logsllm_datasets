I know this has been asked several times, however I'm surprised I couldn't
find an entry suggesting an approach similar to Webpack+Nativescript where
webpack reads vars from the environment and passes down a static object with
the values set. In this case it could work by reading a very specific pattern
from the cli's parameters, like:
    $ flutter run/build --env.DEBUG
And then it would just be a matter of initializing a static data structure
that would hold the passed parameters:
    if (flutter.env.DEBUG) {
        print("DEBUG")
    }
I am aware of the multiple entry points approach, but I think it becomes
unintuitive when the dev environment changes constantly (e.g. having a PC at
work and also working from home or while traveling), let alone when working
with more people and each has their own dev environment and you end up
polluting the working tree just to change an IP to test a change with a local
server.
