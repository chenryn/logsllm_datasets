User: How to configure the network interface on the Linux system to ensure that the server can communicate normally?
Assistant: The steps to configure the network interface on the Linux system to ensure that the server can communicate normally are as follows: 1. Confirm the name of the network card: use the command ```ip addr``` or ```ifconfig``` to view all network cards and their names in the system . 2. Configure the IP address: use the command ```ip addr add <ip address>/<subnet mask> dev <interface>``` to configure the IP address, replace the IP address and subnet mask with the required values, and Replace "<interface>" with the name of your network interface. 3. Configure the default gateway: use the command ```ip route add default via <default gateway>``` to configure the default gateway, and replace "<default gateway>" with the IP address of the gateway. 4. Modify the DNS configuration: add the IP address of the DNS server to the ```/etc/resolv.conf``` file, or configure DNS through the ```systemd-resolved``` service. 5. Test network connection: Use the command ```ping``` or ```curl``` to test whether the server can access the external network. If the connection fails, you can check whether the network connection and DNS configuration are correct, and whether the firewall settings are correct. 6. Save the network configuration: use the command ```systemctl restart networking``` or ```ifdown/ifup``` command to restart the network service, and use the command ```netstat -rn``` to confirm that the network service is running normally . The network configuration can be saved using the ```/etc/network/interfaces``` file.
