## Abstract
Side-channel attacks on mobile devices have gained increasing attention since their introduction in 2007. Traditional side-channel attacks, such as power analysis and electromagnetic analysis, required the physical presence of the attacker and expensive equipment. However, modern mobile devices can be exploited by an (unprivileged) application to leak sensitive information. Given the vast amount of sensitive data stored on smartphones, the implications of side-channel attacks affect both the security and privacy of users and their devices.

In this paper, we propose a new categorization system for side-channel attacks, which is necessary due to the significant evolution of these attacks since their initial scientific investigations during the smart card era in the 1990s. Our proposed classification system allows for a systematic analysis of side-channel attacks and facilitates the development of novel countermeasures. In addition to this new categorization system, our extensive survey of existing attacks and attack strategies provides valuable insights into the evolving field of side-channel attacks, particularly in the context of mobile devices. We conclude by discussing open issues and challenges in this context and outline possible future research directions.

**Index Terms:** Side-channel attacks, information leakage, classification, smartphones, mobile devices, survey, Android.

## I. Introduction
Side-channel attacks exploit unintended information leakage from computing devices or implementations to infer sensitive information. The seminal works of Kocher [1], Kocher et al. [2], Quisquater and Samyde [3], and Mangard et al. [4] introduced attacks against cryptographic implementations to exfiltrate key material from smart cards using timing information, power consumption, or electromagnetic (EM) emanation. These "traditional" side-channel attacks required the attacker to be in physical possession of the device to observe and learn the leaking information. Different attacks assumed different types of attackers and levels of invasiveness. To systematically analyze side-channel attacks, they have been categorized along two orthogonal axes:

1. **Active vs. Passive:** Depending on whether the attacker actively influences the behavior of the device or only passively observes leaking information.
2. **Invasive vs. Semi-Invasive vs. Non-Invasive:** Depending on whether the attacker removes the passivation layer of the chip, de-packages the chip, or does not manipulate the packaging at all.

However, with the advent of cloud computing in the early 2000s, the scope and scale of side-channel attacks changed significantly. While early attacks required physical possession of the device, newer side-channel attacks, such as cache-timing attacks [5]–[7] and DRAM row buffer attacks [8], are conducted remotely by executing malicious software in the targeted cloud environment. With the proliferation of mobile devices, especially those with numerous embedded features and sensors, more sophisticated side-channel attacks targeting smartphones have been proposed since around 2010. For example, attacks allow inferring keyboard input on touchscreens via sensor readings from native apps [9]–[11] and websites [12], deducing a user's location via power consumption available from the proc filesystem (procfs) [13], and inferring a user's identity, location, and diseases [14] via the procfs.

Clearly, side-channel attacks have a long history and have evolved significantly from attacks on specialized computing devices in the smart card era to attacks on general-purpose computing platforms in desktop computers and cloud computing infrastructures, and finally to attacks on mobile devices. Although side-channel attacks and platform security are well-studied topics, it must be noted that smartphone security and associated privacy aspects differ from those in the context of smart cards, desktop computers, and cloud computing. The following key enablers facilitate more devastating attacks on mobile devices:

1. **Always-On and Portability:** Mobile devices are always turned on and carried around, making them tightly integrated into everyday life.
2. **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD):** Employees use personal devices to process corporate data and access corporate infrastructure, highlighting the importance of secure mobile devices.
3. **Ease of Software Installation:** The appification of mobile devices allows for easy installation of additional software, including malicious apps, via established app markets.
4. **OS Based on Linux Kernel:** Modern mobile operating systems, such as Android, are based on the Linux kernel, which was initially designed for desktop machines. Features considered harmless on desktops can pose significant security and privacy threats on mobile devices [16].
5. **Features and Sensors:** Mobile devices include many features and sensors not present on traditional platforms, enabling devastating side-channel attacks. These sensors have also been used to attack external hardware, such as keyboards and computer hard drives [17]–[19], to infer videos played on TVs [20], and even to attack 3D printers [21], [22].

Due to these key enablers, a new area of side-channel attacks has evolved, with most recent attacks being strictly non-invasive and relying on the execution of malicious software in the targeted environment. The existing classification system for analyzing side-channel attacks on smart cards no longer meets the needs of these new attack settings and strategies. Therefore, we establish a new categorization system for modern side-channel attacks on mobile devices. We survey existing side-channel attacks and identify commonalities between them, allowing researchers to identify future research directions and address these attacks on a larger scale.

### A. Motivation and High-Level Categorization
It is important to note that side-channel attacks against smartphones can be launched by attackers who are in physical possession of the devices and by remote attackers who manage to spread seemingly innocuous applications via app stores. In some cases, side-channel attacks can even be launched via websites without requiring the user to install an app. In today’s appified software platforms, an attack scenario requiring the user to install a seemingly harmless game is entirely practical.

Interestingly, side-channel attacks on smartphones exploit both physical properties and software properties. A malicious application can exploit the accelerometer sensor [9], [10] (a physical property) to attack user input, which relies on touchscreens. Additionally, attacks can be conducted by exploiting software features (logical properties) provided by the Android API or the mobile OS itself [13], [14]. This indicates that smartphones significantly broaden the scope and scale of attacks. The appification of mobile platforms allows for targeting devices and users at an unprecedented scale compared to smart cards and cloud settings.

Figure 1 illustrates a high-level categorization system for side-channel attacks. The y-axis indicates the type of information exploited (WHAT?), and the x-axis shows how the adversary learns the leaking information (HOW?). We also indicate how existing side-channel attacks against smart cards, cloud computing infrastructures, and smartphones relate to this system. For example, attackers exploit hardware-based information leakage (physical properties) [4] of smart cards by measuring power consumption with an oscilloscope, requiring physical possession of the device (red cross-hatched area).

In contrast, side-channel attacks against cloud-computing infrastructures do not necessarily require physical presence. These attacks exploit microarchitectural behavior (such as cache attacks [5]–[7], [23]) or software features (such as page deduplication [24]) to infer secret information from co-located processes. The green dashed area in Figure 1 is shifted to the right, indicating reliance on software execution, and below the x-axis, indicating targeting of software features.

Even more diverse side-channel attacks have been proposed for smartphones, indicated by the larger area in Figure 1. These attacks result from the five key enablers mentioned earlier. This area indicates that on smartphones, we deal with local attackers exploiting physical properties and remote attackers executing software to exploit both physical and software features (such as memory footprint [25] or data-usage statistics [14], [26]). In the remainder of this paper, we refine this high-level categorization system to systematically analyze modern side-channel attacks.

Although we do not explicitly focus on Android, the majority of existing papers deal with the Android operating system, reflecting its openness and large market share. Gartner [27] reports that Android sales (86% in Q1 2017) outperform Apple iOS sales (14% in Q1 2017).

## II. Background
In this section, we introduce the basics of mobile security, define the general notion of side-channel attacks, and establish the boundaries between side-channel attacks and other attacks on mobile devices. We stress that side-channel attacks do not exploit specific software vulnerabilities but instead exploit available information that either leaks unintentionally or is published for benign reasons to infer sensitive information indirectly. Finally, we discuss related work.

### A. A Primer on Smartphone Security
Mobile devices, such as tablet computers and smartphones, are powerful multi-purpose computing platforms that enable various application scenarios. Third-party applications can be easily installed to extend the basic functionality of these devices. Examples include gaming applications that use multiple sensors, office applications, banking applications, and more. These examples demonstrate that mobile devices are tightly integrated into everyday life, leading to the storage and processing of sensitive data and information.

To protect this information, modern mobile operating systems rely on two fundamental security concepts: application sandboxing and permission systems. For instance, on Android, the underlying Linux kernel ensures the concept of sandboxed applications. Each application is assigned a user ID (UID), preventing it from accessing resources of other applications. The permission system allows applications to request access to specific resources outside of its sandbox, typically considered sensitive or privacy-relevant. Android categorizes permissions into normal and dangerous categories. Normal permissions are granted automatically during installation, while dangerous permissions must be explicitly granted by the user. Other mobile operating systems, such as Apple’s iOS, rely on similar protection mechanisms.

Besides these basic security concepts, applications themselves rely on cryptographic primitives, cryptographic protocols, and dedicated security mechanisms to protect sensitive resources. For instance, applications rely on...
