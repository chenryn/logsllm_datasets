Abstract—Side-channel attacks on mobile devices have gained
increasing attention since their introduction in 2007. While
traditional side-channel attacks, such as power analysis attacks
and electromagnetic analysis attacks, required physical presence
of the attacker as well as expensive equipment, an (unprivileged)
application is all
it takes to exploit the leaking information
on modern mobile devices. Given the vast amount of sensitive
information that are stored on smartphones, the ramiﬁcations of
side-channel attacks affect both the security and privacy of users
and their devices.
In this paper, we propose a new categorization system for side-
channel attacks, which is necessary as side-channel attacks have
evolved signiﬁcantly since their scientiﬁc investigations during
the smart card era in the 1990s. Our proposed classiﬁcation
system allows to analyze side-channel attacks systematically, and
facilitates the development of novel countermeasures. Besides this
new categorization system, the extensive survey of existing attacks
and attack strategies provides valuable insights into the evolving
ﬁeld of side-channel attacks, especially when focusing on mobile
devices. We conclude by discussing open issues and challenges in
this context and outline possible future research directions.
Index Terms—Side-channel attacks, information leakage, clas-
siﬁcation, smartphones, mobile devices, survey, Android.
I. INTRODUCTION
(unintended)
S IDE-channel attacks exploit
information
leakage of computing devices or implementations to infer
sensitive information. Starting with the seminal works of
Kocher [1], Kocher et al. [2], Quisquater and Samyde [3],
as well as Mangard et al. [4], many follow-up papers con-
sidered attacks against cryptographic implementations to ex-
ﬁltrate key material from smart cards by means of timing
information, power consumption, or electromagnetic (EM)
emanation. These “traditional” side-channel attacks required
the attacker to be in physical possession of the device to be
able to observe and learn the leaking information, yet different
attacks assumed different types of attackers and different levels
of invasiveness. More speciﬁcally, in order to systematically
analyze side-channel attacks, they have been categorized along
the following two orthogonal axes:
1) Active vs passive: Depending on whether the attacker
actively inﬂuences the behavior of the device or only
passively observes leaking information.
2) Invasive vs semi-invasive vs non-invasive: Depending on
whether or not the attacker removes the passivation layer

of the chip, depackages the chip, or does not manipulate
the packaging at all.
However, with the era of cloud computing, the scope and
the scale of side-channel attacks have changed signiﬁcantly in
the early 2000s. While early attacks required attackers to be in
physical possession of the device, newer side-channel attacks
such as cache-timing attacks [5]–[7] or DRAM row buffer
attacks [8] are conducted remotely by executing malicious
software in the targeted cloud environment. With the advent of
mobile devices, and in particular the plethora of embedded fea-
tures and sensors, even more sophisticated side-channel attacks
targeting smartphones have been proposed since around the
year 2010. For example, attacks allow to infer keyboard input
on touchscreens via sensor readings from native apps [9]–[11]
and websites [12], to deduce a user’s location via the power
consumption available from the proc ﬁlesystem (procfs) [13],
and also to infer a user’s identity, location, and diseases [14]
via the procfs.
Clearly, side-channel attacks have a long history and have
evolved signiﬁcantly from attacks on specialized computing
devices in the smart card era, to attacks on general-purpose
computing platforms in desktop computers and cloud comput-
ing infrastructures, and ﬁnally to attacks on mobile devices.
Although side-channel attacks and platform security are al-
ready well-studied topics, it must be noted that smartphone
security and associated privacy aspects differ from platform
security in the context of smart cards, desktop computers, and
cloud computing. Especially the following key enablers enable
more devastating attacks on mobile devices.
1) Always-on and portability: First and foremost, mobile
devices are always turned on and due to their mobility
they are carried around at all times. Thus, they are tightly
integrated into our everyday lives.
2) Bring your own device (BYOD): To decrease the number
of devices carried around, employees use personal de-
vices to process corporate data and to access corporate
infrastructure, which clearly indicates the importance of
secure mobile devices.
3) Ease of software installation: Due to the appiﬁcation [15]
of mobile devices, i.e., where there is an app for almost
everything, additional software can be installed easily by
means of established app markets. Hence, malicious apps
can also be spread at a fast pace.
4) OS based on Linux kernel: Modern mobile operating
systems (OS), for example, Android, are based on the
Linux kernel. The Linux kernel, however, has initially
been designed for desktop machines and information or

features that are considered harmless on these platforms
turn out to be an immense security and/or privacy threat
on mobile devices (cf. [16]).
5) Features and sensors: Last but not least, these devices
include many features and sensors, which are not present
on traditional platforms. Due to the inherent nature of
mobile devices (always-on and carried around, connec-
tivity, inherent input methods, etc.), such features often
enable devastating side-channel attacks. Besides, these
sensors have also been used to attack external hardware,
such as keyboards and computer hard drives [17]–[19],
to infer videos played on TVs [20], and even to attack
3D printers [21], [22], which clearly demonstrates the
immense power of mobile devices.
Due to the above mentioned key enablers, a new area of
side-channel attacks has evolved and the majority of more
recent side-channel attacks are strictly non-invasive and rely
on the execution of malicious software in the targeted envi-
ronment. Considering these developments, we observe that the
classiﬁcation system that has been established to analyze side-
channel attacks on smart cards does not meet these new attack
settings and strategies anymore. Hence, the existing classiﬁ-
cation system does not allow a systematic categorization of
modern side-channel attacks, including side-channel attacks
on mobile devices.
In this work, we close this gap by establishing a new
categorization system for modern side-channel attacks on
mobile devices. Therefore, we survey existing side-channel
attacks and identify commonalities between them. The gained
insights allow researchers to identify future research directions
and to cope with these attacks on a larger scale.
A. Motivation and High-Level Categorization
It is important to note that side-channel attacks against
smartphones can be launched by attackers who are in physical
possession of the devices and also by remote attackers who
managed to spread a seemingly innocuous application via an
existing app store. In some cases such side-channel attacks
can even be launched via websites and, thus, without relying
on the user to install an app. Nevertheless, in today’s appi-
ﬁed software platforms where apps are distributed easily via
available app markets, an attack scenario requiring the user to
install a seemingly harmless game is entirely practical.
Interestingly, side-channel attacks on smartphones exploit
physical properties as well as software properties. A malicious
application can exploit the accelerometer sensor [9], [10] (a
physical property) in order to attack the user input, which is
due to the inherent input method relying on touchscreens. In
addition, attacks can also be conducted by exploiting software
features (a logical property) provided by the Android API or
the mobile OS itself (cf. [13], [14]). This clearly indicates
that smartphones signiﬁcantly broaden the scope as well as
the scale of attacks. Especially the appiﬁcation [15] of mobile
platforms—i.e., where there is an app for everything—allows
to easily target devices and users at an unprecedented scale
compared to the smart card and the cloud setting.
Figure 1 illustrates a high-level categorization system for
side-channel attacks. We indicate the type of information that

is exploited (WHAT?) and how the adversary learns the leaking
information (HOW?) on the y-axis and x-axis, respectively.
Furthermore, we indicate how existing side-channel attacks
against smart cards, cloud computing infrastructures, and
smartphones relate to it, i.e., where existing attacks on the
respective platforms are located in this new categorization
system. For example, attackers exploit hardware-based infor-
mation leakage (physical properties) [4] of smart cards by
measuring the power consumption with an oscilloscope. In this
case, the attacker must be in possession of the device under
attack, which is indicated by the red cross-hatched area.
In contrast, side-channel attacks against cloud-computing
infrastructures do not (necessarily) require the attacker to
be physically present—unless we consider a malicious cloud
provider—as the attacker is able to remotely execute software.
Usually,
these attacks exploit microarchitectural behavior
(such as cache attacks [5]–[7], [23]) or software features (such
as page deduplication [24]) in order to infer secret information
from co-located processes. Hence, the green dashed area in
Figure 1 is shifted to the right as these attacks mostly rely on
software execution, and it is also shifted to the area below the
x-axis as these attacks also target software features.
Even more manifold and diverse side-channel attacks have
been proposed for smartphones, which is indicated by the
larger area in Figure 1. These manifold side-channel attacks
mainly result from the ﬁve aforementioned key enablers. More
speciﬁcally, this area indicates that on smartphones we have to
deal with local attackers that exploit physical properties, but
also with attackers that execute software on the smartphone in
order to exploit both physical properties as well as software
features (logical properties, such as the memory footprint [25]
or the data-usage statistics [14], [26]). In the remainder of this
paper we will reﬁne this high-level categorization system in
order to systematically analyze modern side-channel attacks.
Although we do not explicitly focus on Android in this
paper, the majority of the existing papers deal with the Android
operating system. This reﬂects the trend that the research
community focuses mostly on Android because of its openness
and also because it has the biggest market share among all
mobile operating systems. Gartner [27] reports that Android
sales (86% in Q1 2017) clearly outperform Apple iOS sales
(14% in Q1 2017).

B. Outline
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II introduces background information in terms of mobile
operating systems, the basic notion of side-channel attacks,
and related work. In Section III, we discuss different types
of information leaks and provide a deﬁnition for software-
only side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we introduce our new
categorization system for modern side-channel attacks. We
survey existing attacks in Sections IV, V, and VI, and we
classify existing attacks according to our newly introduced
classiﬁcation system in Section VII. We discuss existing
countermeasures in Section VIII. Finally, we discuss open
issues, challenges, and future research directions in Section IX
and conclude in Section X.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce the basics of mobile security,
deﬁne the general notion of side-channel attacks, and we
establish the boundaries between side-channel attacks and
other attacks on mobile devices. We stress that side-channel
attacks do not exploit speciﬁc software vulnerabilities of
the OS or any speciﬁc library, but instead exploit available
information that either leaks unintentionally or that is (in some
cases) published for benign reasons in order to infer sensitive
information indirectly. Finally, we also discuss related work.
A. A Primer on Smartphone Security
Mobile devices, such as tablet computers and smartphones,
are powerful multi-purpose computing platforms that enable
many different application scenarios. Third-party applications
can be easily installed in order to extend the basic functionality
of these devices. Examples include gaming applications that
make use of the many different sensors, ofﬁce applications,
banking applications, and many more. These examples clearly
demonstrate that mobile devices are already tightly integrated
into our everyday lives, which leads to sensitive data and
information being stored and processed on these devices.
In order to protect this information properly, modern mobile
operating systems rely on two fundamental security concepts,
i.e., the concept of application sandboxing and the concept of
permission systems. For instance, on Android the underlying
Linux kernel ensures the concept of sandboxed applications.
Each application is assigned a user ID (UID), which allows
the kernel to prevent applications from accessing resources of
other applications. The permission system on the other hand
allows applications to request access to speciﬁc resources out-
side of its sandbox, which typically includes resources that are
considered as being sensitive or privacy relevant. Android also
categorizes permissions depending on so-called protection lev-
els. The two important categories of Android permissions are
normal permissions and dangerous permissions, respectively.
While normal permissions are granted automatically during
the installation procedure, dangerous permissions must be
explicitly granted by the user. Other mobile operating systems
such as Apple’s iOS rely on similar protection mechanisms.

Besides these basic security concepts on the OS level,
applications themselves rely on cryptographic primitives, cryp-
tographic protocols, and dedicated security mechanisms to
protect sensitive resources. For instance, applications rely on
