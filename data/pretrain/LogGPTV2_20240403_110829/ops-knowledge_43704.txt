User: I suspected that
airflow run dag_id task_id execution_date
would run all upstream tasks, but it does not. It will simply fail when it sees that not all dependent tasks are run. How can I run a specific task and all its dependencies? I am guessing this is not possible because of an airflow design decision, but is there a way to get around this?
Assistant: You can run a task independently by using -i/-I/-A flags along with the run command.
But yes the design of airflow does not permit running a specific task and all its dependencies. 
You can backfill the dag by removing non-related tasks from the DAG for testing purpose
