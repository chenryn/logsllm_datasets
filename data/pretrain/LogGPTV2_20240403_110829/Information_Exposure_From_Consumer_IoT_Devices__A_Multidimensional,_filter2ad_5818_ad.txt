experiment locations and egress configurations (columns). A key
observation is that cameras collectively expose the largest fraction
of unencrypted bytes (up to 11% in the US testbed), most of which
come from the Microseven camera and Zmodo doorbell in the US,
and the Spy camera in the UK, which are not common to both
testbeds. The next largest fraction of unencrypted bytes (7.1% in
the US and 6.0% in the UK) come from home automation devices
(e.g., D-Link movement sensor) and appliances (mostly Samsung
washer and dryer). On the other end, audio devices tend to use the
most encryption (more than 60% on both testbeds), likely because
they are built and designed by major corporations (e.g., Amazon and
Google) known to have high security standards. Another important
observation is that appliances, home automation devices, and smart
hubs have the largest portion of unknown traffic. After a manual
investigation we found that such devices have a larger fraction of
proprietary protocols not known to Wireshark, which are often
partly encrypted, making the entropy analysis inconclusive and
motivating future investigation.
The Samsung TV and FireTV are the isolated cases showing a
significant difference in encrypted traffic depending on whether
they are connected to the Internet directly or via VPN (Table 7). We
suspect this occurs because the TVs detect the device geolocation
based on egress IP, and customize content displayed to the user
(e.g., available streaming services and content) based on the inferred
country. We have validated this hypothesis by manually observing
what these TVs show when they are powered on and used: the
content displayed clearly reflects the region corresponding the
public IP address of the device and, in the case of VPN experiments,
they advertise services and interactive content that is normally
not available without using the VPN. Turning off the VPN and
restarting the device is able to restore the previous content and
behavior.
Encryption analysis by experiment type. We now investi-
gate whether the experiment type has any impact on the fraction
of (un)encrypted bytes sent. Our results, reported in Table 8, show
video having the lowest fraction of encrypted bytes and voice inter-
actions having the highest. This is similar to the category analysis

Table 7: Average percentage of unencrypted bytes per device.
The topmost devices are common devices to both testbeds,
while the last three exist only in the US lab. Text decora-
tion indicates statistically significant differences across the
following categories: Bold indicates differences when using
VPN; Italic means differences between US and UK.
for TVs and audio devices (i.e., video interactions and the camera
category are analogs, as are voice interactions and audio devices).
The other experiments, which do not have interactions directly
mapped to specific categories, do not show a clear trend, meaning
that the differences in encryption are mostly due to the device itself,
and not to the type of experiment.
This observation also holds for common devices in different
regions. However, we notice less significant trends that may require
further investigation to understand the underlying reasons: power
experiments are the easiest to classify using entropy analysis and
show the highest percentages of both unencrypted (>8.2%) and
unencrypted (>33.0%) traffic. We also observe differences when
devices are connected via VPN (e.g., for encrypted and unencrypted
traffic of video devices). These differences show no clear patterns
and are likely due to changes in device behavior (e.g., similar to
different content/functionality as seen with TVs) when the device
detects a different region.
5.3 Takeaways
While unencrypted traffic is a minority of all traffic, we identi-
fied substantial information exposure via plaintext traffic for all
devices, categories, interactions, and regions. Most differences in
unencrypted traffic across device category and device interactions
are due to specific devices, rather than being endemic of an entire
category of device. We observed regional differences in the use of
encryption, especially in devices in the TVs category, since they in-
teract with different content providers depending on their detected
region.
6 CONTENT ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze the information exposed to other parties
by IoT devices as defined in RQ3 (inferring unencrypted content)
and RQ4 (inferring encrypted content). Specifically, we focus on the
network traffic for two content types: textual PII contained in unen-
crypted network traffic (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, locations as
