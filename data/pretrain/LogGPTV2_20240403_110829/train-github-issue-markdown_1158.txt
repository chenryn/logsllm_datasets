**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Anonymous**

I attempted to redefine some of my classes and mappers using the declarative extension in version 0.4.5. However, I encountered an issue when trying to set the `schema` argument for the table. At runtime, the `schema` value is `None`, which is not suitable for my application.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that only the `autoload` argument is recognized, while other `Table` arguments are ignored. 

Could we consider adding support for a `schema` attribute on a declarative class? This would allow users to specify the schema directly within the class definition, improving flexibility and usability.

Thank you.
