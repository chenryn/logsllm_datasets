 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
I tried to redefine some of my classes and mappers using the declarative
extension in 0.4.5, but I couldn't see how to set the schema argument on the
table. At runtime, schema==None, which won't work for this application.
Looking at the code, it appears only "autoload" is honored, and other Table
args are ignored.
Perhaps we could recognize a **schema** attribute on a declarative class?
