While I assume that your goal is to find living targets, you should also have a resource for locating proof of 
deceased individuals. 1 have used this website numerous times to locate the graves of recently deceased people. 
While not necessarily "proof of death, it provides a great lead toward locating a death certificate and living 
family members. In 2021,1 began finding better results at People Legacy (peoplelegacy.com).
Unclaimed Property
Every' state in the U.S. possesses an unclaimed property' website. Common forms of unclaimed property’ include 
savings or checking accounts, stocks, uncashed dividends, online payments, refunds, and leftover utility’ balances. 
Most of these pages only require a last name to conduct a search. The results almost always include full name, 
home address, property’ type, and amount owed. This can provide a great search resource, and a possible pretext 
for a phone call. A complete collection of these sites with easy access to each state is at Unclaimed 
(unclaimed.org).
If all else fails, or you believe you are missing something, check Google. Searching the address should identify’ 
any leftover information about your target address. When searching, place the street address in quotes excluding 
the city’. An example search may’ appear similar to "1234 Main" "Bethalto" IL. This will mandate that any’ results 
include the exact address and the exact city’ name, but they’ do not necessarily need to be right next to each other 
on the page. If you place the entire address including the city’ inside a single set of quotes, you would miss any
Many’ people will have their address and telephone number unlisted in public telephone books. This prevents 
their information from appearing on some websites. If any’ of these people are registered voters, their address 
may’ still be public. In order to locate this data, you will need to connect to the county clerk of the county’ of 
residence. The link here will display’ a list of all fifty’ states. Clicking the state of the target will present all of the 
counties with known online databases of voter registration content. These will often display’ the full name of the 
voter and full address. This can be sorted by name or address depending on what information you have about 
the target. Later chapters present additional voter registration search options.
The target of your investigation may be an address of your suspect. You may’ want to know who else lives at a 
residence. There are dozens of websites that possess databases of address information. I have outlined a few 
here that are unique from those already discussed. Additionally, the following websites which were [ 
discussed all allow reverse search of a residential address.

Ten years ago, I often queried telephone number porting websites to identify the provider of my target's 
telephone number. This would identify the cellular company that supplied service to my suspect. I would use 
that information within my court order to demand subscriber data about the target Knowing the prorider was 
essential as to not waste time requesting records from companies that had no data to provide. The websites used 
back then have either disappeared, or now charge a substantial fee for access. Five years ago, I noticed that an 
overwhelming amount of my target telephone numbers were connected to Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) 
services such as Google Voice and Twilio. This would often be indicated by a result of "Broadband" or 
"Internet" instead of something obvious such as "Verizon". Until recently, the absence of a specific prorider 
was a hurdle during investigations. Today, we have more sophisticated services that can identify exact provider 
details on practically any number.
If this service cannot proride the data you need, or if you want another source to proride more confidence in 
the result, you should also consider the sites Carrier Lookup (carrierlookup.com) and Phone Carrier Check 
(phonecarriercheck.com). If both of these sendees disappear by the time you need them, a Google search of 
"carrier lookup" should provide new alternatives.

There are hundreds of websites that claim the ability to search for information on telephone numbers and 
addresses. These vary from amazingly accurate results to sites that only include advertisements. If 1 have a target 
telephone number, there are three phases of my search. First, I want to identify the type of number and provider. 
The type could be landline, cellular or internet, and the provider could be the company supplying the sendee. 
Next, I want to identify any subscriber information such as the name and address associated with the account. 
Finally, I want to locate any online web content with a connection to the target number. This can all lead to 
more intelligence and additional searches. The majority of cellular numbers can now be identified if they are 
registered in someone's name. If you have an address, you will want to identify any associated people or 
telephone numbers. This chapter will highlight the sites which can assist with these tasks.
I begin with this option because it has been the most stable and does not limit searching as others do. This site 
requests any domestic or international telephone number and produces a report which includes the country’, 
type of sendee, and provider associated with the number. While many online services can identify the provider 
of a cellular or landline number, this option provides the best details about VOIP numbers. I submitted several 
telephone numbers associated with various proriders that I could personally confirm. The folloxring identifies 
the results of these searches. The first column represents the provider as I knew it, the second column is the 
type, and the third is the provider displayed by Free Carrier Lookup. This is far from complete, but I wanted to 
demonstrate the ability’ to convert internet-based numbers into identifiable companies.

Once you have identified the provider, you should focus on the subscriber data associated with the number. We 
will tackle this in several different ways, as many things changed in 2019. First, wc should focus on the most 
reliable options, which often require registration for a free trial. This chapter becomes quite technical quickly, 
but the tools at the end will simplify everything.
I scoured the internet for every business that provides bulk caller ID data to private companies. Some offer a 
free website for testing; some require you to submit queries through their servers; and others make you register 
for a free trial. I have tested all of them and identified those that are easy to access and give the best results. 
First, I will focus only on easy and reliable ways to search an individual number through specific web addresses 
and Terminal commands. Afterward, I present some legacy services which still prove to be reliable. This section 
was heavily modified in 2021 due to company mergers and removal of free trials.
In 2013, I began experimenting with reverse caller ID data. These are the same databases that identify a 
telephone number on your landline caller ID display. Often, this will include the name associated with the 
number. Until recently, this was something that only appeared on landline numbers, but that has changed. Now 
many cellular telephone numbers have name information associated with them. This name information is usually 
extracted from the cellular telephone service provider. I was immediately shocked at the accuracy of these results 
while searching cellular telephone numbers that were otherwise untraceable. On many of my investigations, this 
technique has eliminated the need to obtain court subpoenas to discover subscriber information.
The reason we can access this data is because it is necessary for telephone systems that do not already possess 
caller ID options. New systems that operate over the internet, referred to as VOIP systems (Voice Over Internet 
Protocol), do not receive caller ID data natively. This is something that we have taken for granted while it was 
provided by our telephone companies. Today, many businesses must purchase access to this data from resellers. 
This presents us with an opportunity.
We now know that this number was not ported from another carrier; it is a mobile number; and it possesses a 
low risk rating. These ratings increase for VOIP, forwarding, and masked numbers, and might indicate that the 
number you are searching is not assigned to any specific individual.
This company provides VOIP services to many apps, companies, and individuals. An extended feature of their 
internet-based phone service is the ability to identify incoming calls through caller ID. Fortunately for us, they 
provide a page on their site that allows queries against their database, but it requires you to register for a free 
trial account. Locate the "Sign up" button and create a free account. Click the confirmation link in the email and
This newer service provides a few pieces of information about a telephone number which I have not seen 
available anywhere else. The following is a partial result of a target telephone number query.

You could do this manually and add your API key, but that is complicated. Instead, consider using my custom 
script, as explained at the end of this section. It also adds the option to query' Twilio via API instead of the web 
portal.

If I could only search two websites, this would be my second pick. I found this sendee in late 2020 and I am 
impressed. The website offers a free trial account with $5.00 in free queries. This could last several years. 
Unfortunately, there is no way to submit a single URL as a query'. You must submit a Get request within Terminal 
to include several pieces of data. The following is the submission structure.
Similar to Twilio and Tclnyx, you must create a free trial account. You must provide an email address and 
telephone number, and I have used temporary’ addresses and Google Voice to bypass this restriction. Navigate 
to this website and register for a free account. Upon completion, you will receive an email with an API license 
key that is valid for approximately’ 20 free successful searches. You will not be charged for empty' results. You 
must validate this address by’ clicking the link included in the message. This is their way of verifying that you 
provided an accurate and real email address. The following information was sent to my’ account.
On the Lookup search page, insert the target number and allow the page to generate a result, which will appear 
directly below. The result will include the type of provider and any name associated with the billing. If I only 
had one website to search, this would be it. Below is an actual redacted result.
Once you are logged in to an account, click "Explore Products" in the left menu. Scroll down to the "Lookup" 
feature on the right. This is the screen which allows querying of numbers, and you may want to bookmark this 
page. I usually only’ select the "Include caller name" unless I want confirmation of the carrier. These searches 
are S0.01 each, which means you should be able to conduct 1500 queries on this single trial. While a bit of an 
annoyance to set up the first time, the work is justified. Make sure you have a valid email and Google Voice 
account ready before registering.
you should be all set. If you are required to verify a telephone number, Google Voice numbers are accepted. 
You should be presented with a $15 credit within Twilio. This should provide numerous searches.

Caller ID Script
296 Chapter 18
You are now ready to submit requests for caller ID information. To do this, you must formulate an API request 
in your browser that includes your username, authentication key, and target telephone number to search. This 
is easier than it sounds. rXll we need is a number to search.
Before reverse caller ID lookups, this information would have required a subpoena. In one 
cellular telephone number searched on Sendee Objects revealed the name "Jennifer S" in the result. During an 
interview with this subject, she disclosed that "Jennifer S" is how she identifies her account on the telephone 
bill that she shares with other family members. She was unaware that this data was sent to the receiving number. 
On many searches, the full name will be present. This should explain why you may be noticing a caller's name 
on your caller ID display when he or she is calling from a cellular number.

This queries the domain (calleridservice.com), our username (jwilson555), our authentication key 
(c2332b496e5bf95), and our target number (6187271200). The sendee confirmed that this cellular number 
belongs to John Williams. I recommend saving the address of your first query as a bookmark or favorite. 
However, you should leave off the target telephone number at the end of the address. This wall prevent the 
sendee from charging you for a credit even time you load this template. You can then add the new target number 
at the end of the bookmark and conduct your searches easily. Caller ID Service grants you SO. 12 in free searches, 
which will allowr you up to 25 queries. Obtaining an additional free trial will only require a different email address. 
We will add this URL to our search tools later.
You may feel overwhelmed with these options. I can relate. For many years, I stored bookmarks of all URLs 
and APIs within my browser, then modified the content of each URL with my new target telephone number. 
This always felt sloppy and often wasted credits. In 2020,1 finally created my own search script which can be 
executed from within the Linux and Mac OSINT machines previously explained. Conduct the following within 
Terminal on your Linux VM to install the script and shortcut. These steps are also included at the end of the 
online linux.txt file explained in Chapter Four.
In previous editions of this book, I explained caller ID lookup features of services including EveryoneAPI, 
BulkCNAM, OpenCNAM, CIDName, and Service Objects. I no longer present these opuons for various 
reasons. EveryoneAPI and OpenCNAM were acquired by Neustar, and no longer offer free trials of the sendee. 
Furthermore, their API requirements are more complicated and some no longer allow searching via static URL 
BulkCNAM became Bulk Solutions and suffers the same fate. CIDName is still present, but new accounts are 
scrutinized and rarely approved for our usage. Service Objects only offers a one-week trial, and the results are 
not great. In my experience, numbers which are not identified through Twilio or Telnyx would also not be 
present wdthin these removed services. Instead of maintaining numerous accounts, I find it better to simply
