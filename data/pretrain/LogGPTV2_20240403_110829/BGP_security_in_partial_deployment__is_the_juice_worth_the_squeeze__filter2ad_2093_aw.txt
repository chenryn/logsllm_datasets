#### Direct Route Selection
The algorithm will select the direct route to \( d \) and will not choose any other route subsequently, as this is its most preferred route. Now, let us assume that for every Autonomous System (AS) chosen in iterations 1 through \( r \), the lemma holds. Let \( v_i \) be the AS chosen at iteration \( r + 1 \) of the Fixed Customer Routes (FCR) process. Consider \( v_i \)'s Best Perceivable Routes (BPR) set at this time. By definition, every route in the BPR set is perceivable and must comply with the Ex condition at each and every "hop" along the route. Note that, combined with the fact that all routes in \( v_i \)'s BPR set are customer routes, the suffix of every such route is also a perceivable customer route.

Consider an AS \( v_j \) that is \( v_i \)'s next-hop on some route in \( v_i \)'s BPR set. Notice that \( v_j \)'s route is fixed at some iteration in \{1, ..., r\} (since \( v_j \) has a shorter perceivable customer route than \( v_i \)). Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, at some point in the S*BGP convergence process, \( v_j \)'s route converges to \( R_{v_j} \) for every such AS \( v_j \). From that point onward, \( v_i \)'s best available routes are precisely those captured by the BPR set in the \( r + 1 \)-th iteration of FCR. Hence, from that moment onwards, \( v_i \) will repeatedly select the route \( R_{v_i} \) according to the tiebreak step TB and will never select a different route thereafter.

#### Lemma B.3: Stabilization in FPeeR
**Lemma B.3.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to \( I \) in FPeeR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

**Proof.** Consider an AS \( v_i \) chosen at some iteration of FPeeR. If \((v_i, v_{i-1}, ..., d)\) is a perceivable peer route, then \((v_{i-1}, ..., d)\) must be a perceivable customer route to satisfy the Ex condition. For every such route in \( v_i \)'s BPR set, it must be the case that the route of \( v_i \)'s next-hop \( v_j \) on this route was fixed in FCR. By Lemma B.2, at some point in the S*BGP convergence process, \( v_j \)'s route converges to \( R_{v_j} \) for every such AS \( v_j \). From that point onward, \( v_i \)'s best available routes are precisely those captured by its BPR set at the iteration of FPeeR in which \( v_i \) is chosen. Therefore, \( v_i \) will select the route \( R_{v_i} \) according to the tiebreak step TB and will never select a different route thereafter.

#### Lemma B.4: Stabilization in FPrvR
**Lemma B.4.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to \( I \) in FPrvR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

**Proof.** We prove the lemma by induction on the number of FPrvR iterations. Consider the first iteration. Let \( v_i \) be the AS chosen at this iteration, let \( v_j \) be a next-hop of \( v_i \) on some route \( R \) in \( v_i \)'s BPR set, and let \( Q \) be the suffix of \( R \) at \( v_j \). Observe that \( Q \) cannot be a provider route, for otherwise \( v_j \) would have been chosen in FPrvR before \( v_i \). Hence, \( Q \) must be either a customer route or a peer route, and so \( v_j \)'s route must have been fixed in either FCR or FPeeR. By the previous lemmas, under S*BGP convergence, every such \( v_j \)'s route will eventually converge to \( R_{v_j} \). Once all such ASes' routes have converged, \( v_i \)'s best available routes are precisely those captured by the BPR set in the \( r + 1 \)-th iteration of FPrvR. Therefore, \( v_i \) will select the route \( R_{v_i} \) according to the tiebreak step TB and will never select a different route thereafter.

Now, let us assume that for every AS chosen in iterations 1 through \( r \), the statement of the lemma holds. Let \( v_i \) be the AS chosen at iteration \( r + 1 \) of FPrvR, and consider \( v_i \)'s BPR set at this time. Let \( v_j \) again be a next-hop of \( v_i \) on some route \( R \) in \( v_i \)'s BPR set, and let \( Q \) be the suffix of \( R \) at \( v_j \). If \( Q \) is a provider route, then \( v_j \)'s route must have been fixed in FPrvR at some point in iterations \{1, ..., r\}. If \( Q \) is either a customer route or a peer route, \( v_j \)'s route must have been fixed in either FCR or FPeeR. By the previous lemmas and the induction hypothesis, under S*BGP convergence, every such \( v_j \)'s route will eventually converge to \( R_{v_j} \). From that moment onward, \( v_i \)'s best available routes are precisely those captured by the BPR set in the \( r + 1 \)-th iteration of FPrvR. Therefore, \( v_i \) will select the route \( R_{v_i} \) according to the tiebreak step TB and will never select a different route thereafter.

#### Correctness of Algorithm for Security 2nd Model
The proof that our algorithm for the security 2nd model outputs the S*BGP routing outcome in this model follows from the combination of the lemmas below. Let \( R_{v_i} \) be the route from \( v_i \) induced by the algorithm's computed next-hops.

**Lemma B.5.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to \( I \) in FSCR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

**Proof.** The proof is essentially the same as the proof of Lemma B.2, where now all routes must be secure.

**Lemma B.6.** Under S*BGP routing, the route of every AS added to \( I \) in FCR is guaranteed to stabilize to the route \( R_{v_i} \).

This completes the optimization of the provided text.
