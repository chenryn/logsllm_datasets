## Who Am I?
- **Name:** Paul Such
- **Twitter:** @0x222
- **Occupation:** Security Engineer and Co-Founder of SCRT (a Swiss security company specializing in ethical hacking, IT security, and digital forensics)
- **Hobbies:** Guitarist, mountain biker, motorsport enthusiast
- **Organizer:** Insomni'hack (security conferences, CTF, etc.), March 2015
- **Research Collaborator:** Florian Gaultier (@agixid)

## Hacking Car Firmware: Why?
- **Fun and Profit!**
- **Extensive research has been done on CANBUS, OBD2, etc.**
- **Car entertainment systems can control various functions: lights, central locking, air conditioning, GPS, Bluetooth, phone, Wi-Fi, auxiliary heating, etc.**
- **Many cars have built-in options that are software-activated: TV, Wi-Fi, auxiliary heating, etc.**

## Model
- **Car:** VW Touareg 2
- **Multimedia System:** RNS 850 (Audi MMI-3G)

## Finding the Firmware – Sources
- **The Hard Way:** Dismantle the car to find the disk/flash (in this case, the drive is inside the glovebox, note the IDE/PATA interface, not SATA).
- **Buy a RNS850 on eBay.**
- **Social Engineering:** Obtain firmware from a VW dealer or mechanic.
- **For Some Models:** Update the GPS, which may also update the firmware (e.g., Audi TT).
- **Google Search:** "RNS850 firmware"

## Upload/Modify the Firmware
- **Direct Disk Access:** No other method available.
- **Magic Combo:** Press PHONE + SET UP together for 3-5 seconds.
- **Rebooting the RNS850:** Requires pressing Phone + Climate + Nav + Traffic + Button simultaneously.
- **Power-User Method:** Use OBD2 + VAGCOM + combo.

## Hidden Menus
- **Accessing Hidden Menus:**
  - Press PHONE + SET UP together for 3-5 seconds.

## Analyzing the Firmware
- **Filesystem:** A mix of EFS & IFS filesystems.
- **Tools Used:**
  - `dumpefs` to dump the filesystem.
  - Custom Python tool to recreate the filesystem using `dumpefs` output.
  - Deflate some files using `deflate`.
  - `dumpifs` to extract files (after editing file headers).

- **Firmware Details:**
  - Based on QNX.
  - ELF header shows a SuperH architecture.

### Example Python Script: `extract-efs.py`
```python
import sys
import os
import re

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <input_file> <output_directory>")
    sys.exit()

with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
    file_content = f.read()

os.system(f"mkdir {sys.argv[2]}")

heads = file_content.split("------------------------------------------------------------------------------ »")
for i, head in enumerate(heads):
    params = {}
    params_raw = head.split("\x0a")
    for param in params_raw:
        if "=" in param:
            key, value = param.split("=", 1)
            params[key] = value

    if ".mode" in params and "name" in params:
        directory = params["name"].replace('"', '')
        if "d" in params[".mode"]:
            os.system(f"mkdir -p {sys.argv[2]}/{directory}")
        else:
            file_name = params["name"].replace('"', '')
            dump = heads[i + 1].split("data", 1)[1]
            lines = dump.split("\n")
            dump_hex = ""
            for line in lines:
                try:
                    clear_line = line.split(":", 1)[1].split("  ", 1)[0]
                    raw_line = clear_line.replace(" ", "\\x")
                    dump_hex += raw_line
                    dump_raw = eval(f'"{dump_hex}"')
                except:
                    pass
            with open(f"{sys.argv[2]}/{directory}/{file_name}", "w") as f2:
                f2.write(dump_raw)
```

## Results
- **Unix-like Filesystem:**
  - `imageInfo/passwd` and `ppp/shadow` reveal user accounts and hashed passwords.
  - `inet.d` lists network services like FTP and Telnet.

- **Leaked Information:**
  - Internal IP ranges and network configurations.
  - Pre-configured SSID and WEP keys for Wi-Fi.

## Oh No! Honey, I Bricked Our Car…
- **Long Story Short:** The car was bricked during an attempt to replace a dummy text file (SMS pre-configured answers).
- **Cause:** Unknown (possibly checksum or upload problem).
- **Fix Time:** 3 months.
- **Outcome:** Replacement of the car's "black box."

## Conclusions
- **Expensive Hobby:** Friends and family no longer allow testing on their cars.
- **Future Work:**
  - Investigate libraries such as `./mmedia/wma9_decoder.so`, `./mmedia/mpega_parser.so`, etc.
