### Table 138: Message Logging on T1600 and TX Matrix Plus Routers

**Page 1301**

Table 138 on page 1301 specifies which messages in a routing matrix are included in the logs on the T1600 routers and the TX Matrix Plus router. The T1600 routers forward only those messages with severity levels of "critical" or higher. Therefore, the log on the TX Matrix Plus router does not include messages with severity levels of "error," "warning," or "notice" that are logged locally on the T1600 routers.

| **Log Location** | **Source of Messages** | **Lowest Severity Included** |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| T1600 router     | Local                  | notice                      |
| TX Matrix Plus router | Local                  | notice                      |
| TX Matrix Plus router | Forwarded from T1600 routers | critical                    |

### Messages Logged When Local Severity Level Is Higher

When the local severity level is set higher than the forwarded severity level, the log on the TX Matrix Plus router includes fewer forwarded messages compared to when the severities are the same. All local logs will also contain fewer messages overall.

For example, you can configure the `/var/log/messages` file to have a severity level of "critical" for local messages and "notice" for forwarded messages:

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
file messages {
    any critical;
}
host sfc0-master {
    any notice;
}
```

### Table 139: Example with Different Severity Levels

**Page 1302**

Table 139 on page 1302 specifies which messages are included in the logs on the T1600 routers and the TX Matrix Plus router. Although the T1600 routers forward messages with severity levels of "notice" or higher, the TX Matrix Plus router discards any forwarded messages with severity levels lower than "critical." None of the logs include messages with severity levels of "error" or lower.

| **Log Location** | **Source of Messages** | **Lowest Severity Included** |
|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| T1600 router     | Local                  | critical                    |
| TX Matrix Plus router | Local                  | critical                    |
| TX Matrix Plus router | Forwarded from T1600 routers | critical                    |

### Configuring Optional Features for Forwarded Messages on a TX Matrix Router

#### Including Priority Information in Forwarded Messages

To include priority information (facility and severity level) in each forwarded message, add the `explicit-priority` statement at the `[edit system syslog host scc-master]` hierarchy level. For the information to appear in a log file on the TX Matrix router, also include the `explicit-priority` statement at the `[edit system syslog file filename]` hierarchy level for the file on the TX Matrix router.

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host scc-master {
    facility severity;
    explicit-priority;
    log-prefix string;
    match "regular-expression";
}
```

#### Adding a Text String to Forwarded Messages

To insert a text string in each forwarded message, include the `log-prefix` statement at the `[edit system syslog host scc-master]` hierarchy level.

#### Using Regular Expressions to Refine the Set of Forwarded Messages

To use regular expression matching to specify more exactly which messages from a facility are forwarded, include the `match` statement at the `[edit system syslog host scc-master]` hierarchy level.

### Configuring Optional Features for Forwarded Messages on a TX Matrix Plus Router

#### Including Priority Information in Forwarded Messages

To include priority information in messages forwarded to the TX Matrix Plus router (or the SFC), add the `explicit-priority` statement at the `[edit system syslog host sfc0-master]` hierarchy level. For the information to appear in a log file on the SFC, also include the `explicit-priority` statement at the `[edit system syslog file filename]` hierarchy level for the file on the SFC.

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host sfc0-master {
    facility severity;
    explicit-priority;
    log-prefix string;
    match "regular-expression";
}
```

#### Adding a Text String to Forwarded Messages

To insert a text string in each forwarded message, include the `log-prefix` statement at the `[edit system syslog host sfc0-master]` hierarchy level.

#### Using Regular Expressions to Refine the Set of Forwarded Messages

To use regular expression matching to specify more exactly which messages from a facility are forwarded, include the `match` statement at the `[edit system syslog host sfc0-master]` hierarchy level.

### Configuring System Logging Differently on Each T640 Router in a Routing Matrix

We recommend that all routers in a routing matrix composed of a TX Matrix router and T640 routers use the same configuration. However, in rare circumstances, you might need to log different messages on different routers. To configure routers separately, include configuration statements in the appropriate groups at the `[edit groups]` hierarchy level on the TX Matrix router.

#### Example Configuration

```plaintext
[edit groups]
re0 {
    system {
        syslog {
            file messages {
                any info;
            }
            host scc-master {
                any none;
            }
        }
    }
}
re1 {
    ... same statements as for re0 ...
}
lcc0-re0 {
    system {
        syslog {
            file messages {
                authorization info;
            }
        }
    }
}
lcc0-re1 {
    ... same statements as for lcc0-re0 ...
}
lcc1-re0 {
    system {
        syslog {
            file messages {
                any notice;
            }
        }
    }
}
lcc1-re1 {
    ... same statements as for lcc1-re0 ...
}
```

### Configuring System Logging Differently on Each T1600 or T4000 Router in a Routing Matrix

We recommend that all routers in a routing matrix composed of a TX Matrix Plus router with T1600 or T4000 routers use the same configuration. However, in rare circumstances, you might need to log different messages on different routers. To configure routers separately, include configuration statements in the appropriate groups at the `[edit groups]` hierarchy level on the TX Matrix Plus router.

#### Example Configuration

```plaintext
[edit groups]
re0 {
    system {
        syslog {
            file messages {
                any info;
            }
            host sfc0-master {
                any none;
            }
        }
    }
}
re1 {
    ... same statements as for re0 ...
}
lcc0-re0 {
    system {
        syslog {
            file messages {
                authorization info;
            }
        }
    }
}
lcc0-re1 {
    ... same statements as for lcc0-re0 ...
}
lcc1-re0 {
    system {
        syslog {
            file messages {
                any notice;
            }
        }
    }
}
lcc1-re1 {
    ... same statements as for lcc1-re0 ...
}
```

### Directing System Log Messages to a Remote Destination

#### Specify the Facility and Severity of Messages to Include in the Log

Each system log message belongs to a facility, which groups together messages generated by the same source or concerning similar conditions. Each message is preassigned a severity level, indicating the impact of the triggering event on the routing platform functions.

When configuring logging for a facility and destination, specify a severity level for each facility. Messages from the facility that meet or exceed this severity level are logged to the specified destination.

```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
(console | file filename | host destination | user username) {
    facility severity;
}
```

For more information about the destinations, see "Directing System Log Messages to a User Terminal" on page 1314, and "Directing System Log Messages to the Console" on page 1315.
