ABSTRACT
This paper presents the results of a cryptographic analysis
of the protocols used by the European Rail Traﬃc Manage-
ment System (ERTMS). A stack of three protocols secures
the communication between trains and trackside equipment;
encrypted radio communication is provided by the GSM-R
protocol, on top of this the EuroRadio protocol provides
authentication for a train control application-level proto-
col. We present an attack which exploits weaknesses in all
three protocols: GSM-R has the same well known weak-
nesses as the GSM protocol, and we present a new collision
attack against the EuroRadio protocol. Combined with de-
sign weaknesses in the application-level protocol, these vul-
nerabilities allow an attacker, who observes a MAC collision,
to forge train control messages. We demonstrate this at-
tack with a proof of concept using train control messages we
have generated ourselves. Currently, ERTMS is only used
to send small amounts of data for short sessions, therefore
this attack does not present an immediate danger. However,
if EuroRadio was to be used to transfer larger amounts of
data trains would become vulnerable to this attack. Addi-
tionally, we calculate that, under reasonable assumptions,
an attacker who could monitor all backend control centres
in a country the size of the UK for 45 days would have a 1%
chance of being able to take control of a train.

INTRODUCTION
The European Rail Traﬃc Management System (ERTMS)
Standard provides a suite of protocols used to deliver next-
generation train management and signalling.1 This standard
is designed with the intention to enable trains to interoper-
ate across borders and optimise the running operation of

railways. At present, the system is being rolled out across
Europe and also on high-speed lines around the world.
ERTMS is formed of three core communication layers:
GSM-R, EuroRadio and the Application Layer protocol (see
Figure 1). The EuroRadio and the Application Layer proto-
cols form ETCS, the European Train Control System. The
lowest layer of the stack, GSM-R, is a rail-speci(cid:12)c variant
of the GSM protocol, used for communications between the
train and trackside infrastructure. EuroRadio, the middle
layer, provides authentication and integrity of messages sent
between the train and track side components using crypto-
graphic MACs. The Application Layer protocol is the high-
est layer of the stack; this is a stateful protocol that includes
timestamps and message acknowledgements to prevent the
replay of messages and ensure successful communication.
In this paper, we present the results of a cryptographic
analysis of the ERTMS communication stack, in which we
determined whether arbitrary, unauthorised messages can
be sent to trains or trackside equipment. We show that one
such attack is possible and give details on the exact circum-
stances which would allow it to happen. We also propose
several solutions to mitigate this vulnerability.
The MAC algorithm used in EuroRadio is a modi(cid:12)ed ver-
sion of the ISO 9797-1 MAC Algorithm 3 [13, 23], a standard
which was introduced in 2011. The ISO algorithm is a CBC-
MAC that uses a single DES transformation for all but the
last block, which is encrypted using triple DES (3DES) using
two diﬀerent keys. The use of only two keys for the 3DES
operation is a potential weakness, so EuroRadio uses triple
DES (3DES), with 3 distinct keys, for this (cid:12)nal block.
As with any 64-bit MAC, it is possible for collisions to
occur, i.e., two diﬀerent messages may have the same MAC
for a particular key. Such a collision is unlikely (requiring
229 messages for a 1% chance) however an attacker that can
wait long enough will eventually observe one. A well de-
signed protocol should not be vulnerable to an attacker that
observes colliding MACs. However, we show in Section 4
that in the case of EuroRadio that such a collision can be
used to retrieve the (cid:12)rst of the three DES keys using brute-
force.
Establishing one of the keys used by the MAC should
not pose an immediate threat to the integrity of the pro-
tocol, as the (cid:12)nal transformation when generating a MAC
involves a 3DES encryption with three distinct keys. An
attacker, therefore, cannot simply generate a valid MAC
for any ERTMS message to send to a train. However, the
ERTMS speci(cid:12)cation allows a number of messages to be sent
with optional packets. By using these optional packets, we
show that it is possible to carefully craft a forged message
with a valid MAC, e.g. a Movement Authority allowing a
train to proceed further than it was safe to proceed, which
would be accepted by a train.
Taking the UK train network as an example we look at
the likelihood of a collision to occur, required to perform the
attack. We (cid:12)nd that due to current data speeds and session
lengths, this is very unlikely for a single train. However,
if EuroRadio was used to transfer larger amounts of data
(for instance, transmitting train diagnostic data) it could be
more likely broken. We go on to consider an attacker that
is capable of monitoring the entire ERTMS backbone of a
country the size of the UK and (cid:12)nd that, when monitoring
the network for 45 days, an attacker has a 1% chance of
observing the collision needed to be able to take control of a
train. We present a number of mitigations, both short-term
and long-term based, against the presented attack.
In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
(cid:15) Security analysis of cryptography used in ERTMS.
We perform a security analysis of the cryptography
implemented in each layer of the ERTMS standard
(GSM-R, EuroRadio and Application Layer protocol).
(cid:15) A message forging attack against the EuroRadio
protocol. We implement an attack whereby a mes-
sage can be forged to match a valid MAC by exploiting
several limitations of the EuroRadio MAC algorithm,
and weaknesses in the Application Layer protocol.
(cid:15) Mitigation and (cid:12)xes. We assess potential mitiga-
tions and (cid:12)xes to the attack discovered, and propose
alternative MAC algorithms suitable for use in Euro-
Radio.
In the next section, we provide an overview of the ERTMS
system at a high level, and in Section 4, we describe how it
is possible to retrieve one of the keys used in the EuroRadio
MAC algorithm. In Section 5, we show how it is possible to
create valid MACs for train control messages by an unau-
thorised party. The implementation of the MAC collision
and DES key recovery methods is presented in Section 6.
We then discuss the time needed to (cid:12)nd the collisions re-
quired for our attack in Section 7, discussing (cid:12)xes to the un-
derlying protocols, analysis of their collision resistance and
performance impact in Section 8, concluding in Section 9.
Related work. The EuroRadio MAC is similar to ISO
9797-1 MAC Algorithm 3 [13]. Mitchell [17] and Preneel et
al. [21, 12] have previously analysed the ISO 9797-1 MAC Al-
gorithm 3 design and found collision-based key recovery at-
tacks, requiring 232:5 known plaintext-MAC pairs and 3(cid:1) 256
oﬄine operations. The EuroRadio MAC replaces the use of
two key 3DES in ISO 9797-1 MAC Algorithm 3 with the use
of three distinct keys, so these attacks are no longer feasi-
ble. Franekova et al. [8, 9], discuss similar attacks against
the EuroRadio MAC, however the use of 3DES means that
the attacks they discuss will not work in practice.
P(cid:19)epin and Vigliotti [18] discuss the cryptographic mech-
anisms used in ERTMS key distribution, consider standard
attacks against 3DES, such as a related-key attack and quan-
tify the cost and resources required to break 3DES, which

presents the (cid:12)rst feasible attack against the cryptography
used by ERTMS.
At a more abstract level, De Ruiter et al. [6] present a
formal analysis of the security of the EuroRadio key estab-
lishment protocols, however they abstract away from the
cryptographic details. Bloom(cid:12)eld et al. [3] provide a high-
level security analysis of ERTMS, but did not (cid:12)nd the vul-
nerability in the EuroRadio MAC presented in this paper.
2. ERTMS OVERVIEW
In this section, we present a high-level overview of the
communication systems in ERTMS, focussing on some of
the more complex components and provide context to the
functioning of ERTMS.
Within ERTMS, two important components are Radio
Block Centres (RBCs) and balises.
RBCs are entities which are responsible for trains in a
speci(cid:12)c area. They take care of the sending and receiving of
signalling and train control information to and from trains
under their control. A single RBC is typically responsible
for a geographical radius of approximately 70 kilometres2.
Every RBC is connected to a (cid:12)xed network in order to hand
over trains to the next RBC when a train leaves its area of
control. Trains are authorised to operate on particular sec-
tions of track using Movement Authority (MA) commands.
These are Application Layer messages which contain rele-
vant information sent from the RBCs to the trains. They
include details such as, for example, the maximum speed
a train may operate at and the distance that the train is
allowed to move under this command.
The RBC determines the positions of the trains in its
area through position reports sent by the trains. Based
on this information, signalling commands are provided, if
the track ahead is clear. The train determines its position
through balises, RFID-like units which are embedded into
the trackbed, typically in pairs. As a train passes over a
‘balise group’, it may then determine the direction of travel,
and relevant data is emitted to the train, for example, line
speed limits, distance to the next balise group, balise group

ID and other appropriate operational information such as
track gradient and pro(cid:12)le.
Communication between the various components of the
trackside infrastructure is speci(cid:12)ed in the ERTMS standard.
However, it should be noted that ERTMS, whilst interoper-
able, does not have a requirement for open operation within
the signalling subsystems, which may be proprietary.
Currently, there are three operational levels to ERTMS:
(cid:15) Level 1, is simply an overlay to the existing national
signalling systems. Balises may optionally be used to
provide movement authorities to trains operating on
equipped lines. Lineside signals at this level remain
mandatory, dependent on the national system in place.
(cid:15) Level 2 removes the need for lineside signals, where
balises at this level provide only static data, including
position data. Movement authorities are provided to
the train over GSM-R by the trackside RBC. Lineside
signals may optionally be retained, however, are not
mandatory.
(cid:15) Level 3 uses a similar principle to Level 2, however
integrity of safe operation is solely controlled through
onboard means (i.e. track-based detection equipment
is no longer required), therefore, allowing moving block
operation of the trains, to increase utilisation of previ-
ously constrained capacity on the rail network.
2.1 GSM-R
GSM-R is the lowest level communication protocol used
in ERTMS between the train and trackside [11, 10]. How-
ever, it is not used for communications between trains and
balises. Based on the GSM Mobile Communications Stan-
dard3, GSM-R uses diﬀerent frequency ranges based on na-
tional spectrum availability, and provides additional rail-
speci(cid:12)c functionality. The additional functionality includes
support for multi-party communication between drivers, emer-
gency calling functionality, and priority-based pre-emption
(i.e. active calls may be terminated if a higher priority call is
received). ERTMS command and control messages are sent
at the highest priority in GSM-R, and cannot be pre-empted.
In comparison to the cell-based GSM standard, GSM-R uses
an alternative network cell layout, where base stations are
located along, or near railway lines, and an overlap is pro-
vided to ensure redundancy should one cell fail.
In the United Kingdom, a nationwide rollout of GSM-
R for voice was completed by the Infrastructure Manager,
Network Rail in 2014 to replace the outdated Cab Secure
Radio system, with GSM-R data support rolled out on the
Cambrian line in 2010 during the rollout of ERTMS on the
line.
Cryptography used in GSM-R. GSM-R uses the A5
suite of cryptographic ciphers, more speci(cid:12)cally A5/1, a
stream cipher based on Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LF-
SRs). Optionally, the block cipher, A5/3, may be supported.
These ciphers are used for encryption of the communication
between mobile stations (e.g. trains and handheld devices)
and a GSM-R Base Station, providing con(cid:12)dentiality dur-
ing transmission. Mobile handsets and devices are authen-
ticated onto the network, however, the base station is never
authenticated to the handset.

2.2 EuroRadio
The EuroRadio protocol is a middle layer protocol that
sits between the GSM-R and Application Layer protocols,
providing authentication and integrity veri(cid:12)cation for mes-
sages sent and received between the train and backend. Euro-
Radio’s main purpose is to provide guarantees that messages
received are authentic, by adding cryptographic MACs. It
relies on GSM-R to provide encryption between the train
and mobile base station. EuroRadio includes provisions for
an algorithm negotiation phase during the handshake, how-
ever, currently there is only one option for this.
The message authentication algorithm used is based on
the ISO 9797-1 MAC Algorithm 3 (also known as ANSI
X9.19 Optional Procedure 1) [23, 13, 1]. This algorithm
computes a message’s MAC using a combination of the DES
and 3DES ciphers by dividing a message into n blocks of 64
bits, padded appropriately, which are fed into a CBC circuit
which uses DES for the (cid:12)rst (n (cid:0) 1) blocks of a EuroRadio
payload and 3DES for the (cid:12)nal block of this payload (see
Figure 2). The MAC is computed on the length of the entire
message, the ETCS ID of the recipient, the message being
sent and optional padding to ensure appropriate length for
the MAC computation [23]. The pre(cid:12)x consists of the mes-
sage length and recipient ETCS ID, which is 40 bits long.
The MAC algorithm used in EuroRadio uses three dis-
tinct keys in the (cid:12)nal 3DES computation, whereas the ISO-
speci(cid:12)ed algorithm uses only two keys in the (cid:12)nal round.
EuroRadio uses Padding Method 1, speci(cid:12)ed in ISO 9797:
0s are used as padding such that the size of the data be-
comes a multiple of the block size. If the data is already a
multiple of the block size, no padding is added.
The keys used by EuroRadio to generate the MACs are
session keys, derived from a pre-shared 3DES key and nonces
exchanged between the parties during the protocol hand-
shake phase.
In addition to ensuring validity and integrity of messages
sent to and from a train and backend equipment, this layer
oﬀers the ability to set the priority of messages to either ‘nor-
mal’ or ‘high’. All messages which have a ‘normal’ priority
set, must have a MAC computed and added to the payload.
‘High’ priority messages do not contain a MAC and bypass
veri(cid:12)cation by the EuroRadio layer but can only be used to
send a very restricted set of commands, such as emergency
stop messages.
