the symbol index within the epoch as m = (cid:3) t‚àíi¬∑Te
(cid:4). The
Ts
corresponding physical layer symbol is thus ri,m.
To allow easy synchronization with the jamming signals
on authorized devices, we propose to use both the secret key
and the epoch index to control the PRNG for jamming signal
generation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, to generate the jamming symbols
in epoch i, the ally jammer, say AJg, Ô¨Årst uses the key
kg and the epoch index i as the seed to the PRNG to
get a sequence of pseudo random Ô¨Çoating numbers, i.e.,
(cid:5)a0, a1, . . . , a2n‚àí1(cid:6) = P RN G(kg, i), and then forms each
jamming symbol ri,m as ri,m = a2m + a2m+1 ¬∑ j, where
m = 0, 1, ..., n ‚àí 1. As a result, the jamming signals are
pseudo-random samples, which are independent of the noise
and shifted versions of themselves. Therefore, when an
authorized device comes to the network, it can reÔ¨Åne its
synchronization with the ally jammer, and eventually remove
the jamming signals.
Te
Note that the quality of the jamming signals is affected
by two parameters: the duration of each jamming symbol
Ts, and the precision of the pseudo random numbers used
for the real and the imaginary parts of jamming symbols.
To maximize the uncertainty of the jamming signals, the
smallest value for Ts and the maximum precision allowed
for the jamming symbols can be used. Both parameters
are eventually limited by the hardware used for emitting
jamming signals. Finally,
the
jamming symbols should be transmitted without modulation
and encoding.

each other, and the authorized device only needs to consider
possible symbol alignments within this time window. In our
example, since the authorized device is in the (i ‚àí 2)-th
epoch, it should regenerate the following sequence of jam-
ming symbols from the ally jammer: rd,0, rd,1, . . . , rd,n‚àí1,
where d ‚àà [i ‚àí 2 ‚àí w, i ‚àí 2 + w].
To obtain the synchronization with the ally jammer, the
authorized device can use correlation to Ô¨Ånd the loca-
tion of the received samples yi,k, . . . , yi,l
in the locally
generated symbols. Correlation is a popular technique for
detecting known signal patterns on the receiver side. As-
suming the correlation length is L. The authorized device
can Ô¨Årstly align yi,k, . . . , yi,k+L‚àí1 with the Ô¨Årst L signals
in rd,0, rd,1, . . . , rd,n‚àí1, compute the correlation, shift the
alignment by one sample and re-compute the correlation,
until a spike at
is identiÔ¨Åed. The
jamming signals are pseudo-random samples, which are
independent of the noise and shifted versions of themselves.
Therefore,
the correlation is near zero except when the
correct alignment is found.

However, the above statement is only partially correct as
the frequency offset can disrupt the correlation. For example,

The frequency offset part ej2œÄŒîfgti,k+n introduces dynamic
phases to the individual components in the above sum, which
may lead to signal cancellation. Therefore, the authorized
device must compensate for frequency offset before the cor-
relation can be used for synchronization. After compensating
for the frequency offset (we will discuss frequency offset
compensation in IV-C), the correlation output becomes:

B. Synchronizing with Ally Jamming Signals
1) Synchronizing by Correlation: An authorized device
has to synchronize with ally jammers, so that it can esti-
mate and remove the ally jamming signals to maintain its
communication. The goal of synchronization is to align the
received ally jamming symbols with the locally generated
ally jamming signals, even though these received signals
have been distorted by the unknown wireless channel param-
eters(i.e., when the parameters Œ≥, Œîf, and Œº in Equation (2)
are unknown).

Figure 4. Synchronization with ally jamming signals.
Correlation Position
Let us use Figure 4 to explain the synchronization process
in ally friendly jamming. In this and the following two
sections, we will focus on one ally jammer for simplicity,
and defer the discussion of multiple ally jammers to the
Section IV-E. Assuming when an authorized device joins the
network, the ally jammer, say AJg, is in the i-th epoch on its
local clock and the ally jamming signals being transmitted
are ri,k, . . . , ri,l. The corresponding jamming signals re-
ceived by the authorized device are yi,k, . . . , yi,l. Assuming
the frequency offset between AJg and the authorized device
is Œîfg, based on Equation (1), we have
yi,m = hejŒ≥ej2œÄŒîfgti,m ri,m + ni,m, m ‚àà [k, l].
At the same time, the authorized device is in the (i + Œ¥)-
th epoch on its own clock (Œ¥ = ‚àí2 in Figure 4). Assuming
the authorized device knows that the ally jammer is AJg
(we will address how to distinguish ally jammers in Sec-
tion IV-C), it can use the secret key kg and its epoch indices
to regenerate the ally jamming symbols locally. It is assumed
that the ally jammer and authorized devices are loosely
synchronized, with maximum clock difference of ŒîT . Thus,
the current local epochs of this authorized device and the ally
(cid:9) epochs away from
jammer will not be more than w = (cid:8) ŒîT

Therefore, by detecting the correlation spike, the authorized
device is able to synchronize with the ally jammer.
Recall that there is also a sampling offset between the
received ally jamming signals and the self-generated signals.
For example, assuming for any transmitted jamming signal
ri,m, the received signal by authorized device with sampling
offset Œº is ri,m+Œº. After generating ri,m with the shared key,
the authorized device interpolates it at a rate of N. As a re-
sult, ri,m will be expanded to ri,m+p/N , p = 0, . . . , N ‚àí 1.
When N is large enough (in our experiments, N = 16 gives
a good enough resolution), there will be a value p0 such that

use p0/N to approximate the sampling offset Œº.

Figure 5. Received samples interpolation. Interpolation rate N = 16. The
selected interpolated samples are close to the received samples.
To decide the value of p0, the authorized device uses a
selection of the interpolated samples rather than the samples
before interpolation, to correlate with the received signals.
The authorized device can try all values of p = 0, 1, . . . , N‚àí
1, the one achieving the maximum correlation spike value
is regarded as p0, which can be used to approximate the
sampling offset for the following samples.
C. The Introduction of Pilot Frequencies
In order to compensate for the frequency offset as well as
identify ally jammers rapidly, we introduce the concept pilot
frequency into ally friendly jamming. A pilot frequency is
a 1 Hz wide frequency uniquely associated with each ally
jammer, injected along with the pseudo-random jamming
signals into the channel. On the receiver side, the authorized
device can use this pilot frequency to identify the associated
ally jammer and compute the frequency offset between them.
Before applying pilot frequency, we need to assign a
proper pilot frequency to each ally jammer. Assuming the
maximum frequency offset between ally jammers and autho-
rized devices is fmax, the frequency offset Œîf ‚àà [0, fmax).
We assign (2g ‚àí 1)fmax as the ally jammer AJg‚Äôs pilot
frequency and designate [(2g ‚àí 2)fmax, 2gfmax) as the
associated shift range, as shown in Figure 6.
For each ally jammer, along with the generated pseudo-
random signals, it also generates the signals of its pilot
Figure 6. Pilot frequency assignment.
frequency. Assume an epoch has n pseudo-random signals,
the ally jammmer will generate n pilot frequency signals,
and apply them to all epochs. For example, for the ally
jammer AJg with the pilot frequency (2g ‚àí 1)fmax, the
pilot frequency signal it will generate for the m-th pseudo-
random signals in all epochs is
pfm = ej2œÄ(2g‚àí1)fmaxmTs .
pfm will be added up onto the m-th generated pseudo-
random signals in all the epochs. Hence the m-th jamming
signals in epoch i, say si,m, is given by
si,m = ri,m + pfm.
On the receiver side, for transmitted signal si,m, assuming
the authorized device will
the frequency offset
receive
is Œîfg,
yi,m = hejŒ≥ej2œÄŒîfgti,msi,m + ni,m
= hejŒ≥ej2œÄŒîfgti,m(ri,m + pfm) + ni,m.
As ri,m are pseudo-random samples, their energy is spread
over a wide range of spectrum. On the other hand, the pilot
frequency signals pfm concentrate all their energy on a
narrow band (1Hz wide), which will achieve a much larger
magnitude, as shown in Figure 7. Therefore, on the receiver
side, if the authorized device analyzes the spectrum of the
received signals, it will Ô¨Ånd a spike within the designated
shift range of the pilot frequency. Since the designated pilot
frequency shift ranges of different ally jammers do not
overlap, as shown in Figure 6, the pilot frequencies can be
used for ally jammer identiÔ¨Åcation.
Assuming the ally jammer AJg is identiÔ¨Åed, the autho-
rized device knows its pilot frequency (2g‚àí1)fmax. And as
Œîfg + (2g ‚àí 1)fmax has also been detected, the authorized
device can infer their frequency offset Œîfg, which can be
used further to compensate for their frequency offset.

D. Detecting and Recovering Transmissions
After synchronizing with the ally jamming signals, the
authorized device needs to detect and recover potential trans-
missions from other authorized devices. Before a transmis-
sion is recovered, the authorized device cannot distinguish
it is authorized or unauthorized. Therefore, the authorized
device will try to detect and recover all transmissions in
the same way. For simplicity, in this section and the fol-
lowing section, we assume all transmissions are authorized
transmissions. And we also assume that there is only one
authorized transmission at one time, the media access control
mechanism in ally friendly jamming will be presented later.
1) Re-synchronization & Transmission Detection: When
the authorized device joins the network, it needs to synchro-
nize with the ally jamming signals, this process is denoted
as the initial synchronization. After initial synchronization,
we have each authorized device re-synchronize with the ally
jamming signals periodically. Figure 8 illustrates the re-
synchronization process. Assuming that an authorized device
re-synchronizes with the ally jamming signals every T time
