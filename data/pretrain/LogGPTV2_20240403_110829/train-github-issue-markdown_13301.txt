Users are confused by this:
            if not index._verify_integrity():
                dups = index.get_duplicates()
                err_msg = 'Tried columns 1-X as index but found duplicates %s'
                raise Exception(err_msg % str(dups))
this was added as I recall to give a somewhat better error message when
INFERENCE (fewer column labels than columns of data) but this error message is
also getting raised when there are duplicates in an explicitly specified
`index_col`
