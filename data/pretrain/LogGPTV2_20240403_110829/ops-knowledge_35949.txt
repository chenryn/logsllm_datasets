User: I have read the documentation but I don't understand.
Why do I have to use distutils to install python modules ?
Why do I just can't save the modules in python path ?
Assistant: You don't have to use distutils. You can install modules manually, just like you can compile a C++ library manually (compile every implementation file, then link the .obj files) or install an application manually (compile, put into its own directory, add a shortcut for launching). It just gets tedious and error-prone, as every repetive task done manually.
Moreover, the manual steps I listed for the examples are pretty optimistic - often, you want to do more. For example, PyQt adds the .ui-to-.py-compiler to the path so you can invoke it via command line.
So you end up with a stack of work that could be automated. This alone is a good argument.
Also, the devs would have to write installing instructions. With distutils etc, you only have to specify what your project consists of (and fancy extras if and only if you need it) - for example, you don't need to tell it to put everything in a new folder in site-packages, because it already knows this.
So in the end, it's easier for developers and for users.
