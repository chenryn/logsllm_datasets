**ATT&CK ID:** T1030  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Data Transfer Size Limits

An adversary may exfiltrate data in fixed-size chunks rather than transferring entire files, or they may limit the size of each packet to remain below certain thresholds. This technique is often employed to evade network data transfer threshold alerts and other detection mechanisms. By breaking the data into smaller, less conspicuous pieces, the adversary can reduce the likelihood of being detected during the exfiltration process.
