include kinship, ancestry and partner compatibility testing.
IX.J.1 Setting
The customer ships her specimen (usually saliva) to a company. This specimen
is used to genotype typically one million SNPs and the data is then digitized and
stored in digital form on the server. Some computation is done on this data for
ancestry, disease susceptibility, kinship or other tests. The data and the results
are then available for the user to download or see through a browser. Some
companies (e.g., 23andme) allow to search for people with common ancestors
e.g., 3rd, 4th or 5th cousins.
IX.J.2 Threat Model
We assume the threat models for specimen collection, digitization and inter-
pretation. There are also new threats. The owner of the data posts his data
online along with his identity and some phenotypical data, as done for example
on openSNP.org. We assume that the data owner makes an informed decision,
so he willingly gives away his genome privacy. The major threat then is to the
blood relatives of the data owner, whose private information is also leaked.
Genomic data aggregation is another issue caused by users posting their
genomic data online. This data can be aggregated by companies and then used
for commercial or other purposes. It is worth noting that some genome-sharing
websites have an achievement programs where users get rewards whenever they
post their phenotype data (e.g., hair color, eye color, disease pre-disposition
etc.). Genomic data along with phenotypic data is much more valuable than
genomic data alone.
IX.J.3 Solutions and Open Problems
All other solutions apply here, however recreational genomics presents new prob-
lems of public sharing and genomic data aggregation. We emphasize that public
36
awareness is required to enable people to make an informed decision to share
their genomic data publicly and thus compromising their own and their rela-
tives’ privacy. It should be made clear that in case of abuse of this publicly
available data, people would be discouraged to share genomic data even for le-
gitimate research purposes. However, this is a policy and ethics debate and is
out of scope of this paper.
Conclusion
The conﬂuence of cheap computing and high-throughput sequencing technolo-
gies is making genomic data increasingly easy to collect, store, and process. At
the same time, genomic data is being integrated into a wide range of applica-
tions in diverse settings (e.g., healthcare, forensics, consumer-related products),
such that privacy and security issues have yet to be suﬃciently deﬁned and
addressed. For instance, massive computation capability is needed to analyze
genomic data for research purposes, such that the cloud is likely to play a large
role in the management of such data. At the same time, genomic data will
be used in speciﬁc applications (e.g., forensics) where mobile computing envi-
ronments (e.g., tablets and smartphones) will be routinely used to access those
data. And, genomic data will be increasingly available on the Web, especially
in citizen-contributed environments, (e.g., online social networks). While some
individuals are sharing such information, there are signiﬁcant privacy concerns
because it is not known what such information is capable of revealing, or how
it will be used in the future.
As such, there is a clear need to support personalized medicine, genomic
research, forensic investigation and recreational genomics while respecting pri-
vacy. Computing is a crucial enabler, but can also be the ﬁrst source of leakage if
appropriate mechanisms are not put in place. Our survey (opinion poll from the
biomedical community) provides some insight into what may be the most impor-
tant aspects of the problem to study. And, along these lines, we have provided
a review of the state-of-the-art regarding computational protection methods in
this ﬁeld, as well as the main challenges moving forward. To assist the data pri-
vacy and security community to develop meaningful solutions, we have provided
a framework to facilitate the understanding of the privacy-preserving handling
of genomic data.
