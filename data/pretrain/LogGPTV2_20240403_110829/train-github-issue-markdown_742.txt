    RuntimeError: iter.device(arg).is_cuda() INTERNAL ASSERT FAILED at /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1587428398394/work/aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/Loops.cuh:56, please report a bug to PyTorch.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. A float-point number ResNet was trained
  2. The pre-trained ResNet was prepared for QAT
  3. When QAT ran on the first epoch, it raised the message above.
## Expected behavior
The model should be able to move from system memory to GPU memory.
## Environment
Please copy and paste the output from our  
environment collection script  
(or fill out the checklist below manually).
You can get the script and run it with:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/pytorch/master/torch/utils/collect_env.py
    # For security purposes, please check the contents of collect_env.py before running it.
    python collect_env.py
