connected hotspots was about 44,000, with 34,000 hotspots online.
We are also interested in understanding where new hotspots
are deployed. On March 7th, 2021, we found approximately 15,000
online hotspots located within the United States and 1,000 online
hotspots located outside of the United States. On May 26th, 2021,
we found approximately 20,000 online hotspots in the US and about
14,000 outside of the US. While international coverage is growing
rapidly, the network launched in the US in summer 2019 and was
not available outside the US until summer 2020.
4.3 Who is Deploying Hotspots?
Every hotspot has a designated owner, or more precisely, a wallet
that receives the rewards earned by the hotspot. We found an
exponential decay relationship between the number of hotspots a
single owner owns and the number of owners; approximately 5,700
owners (62.1%) own only one hotspot, about 1,300 owners (14.6%)
own two hotspots, about 600 owners (7%) own three hotspots. There
are about 9,000 unique owners total, of which 83.7% own 3 or fewer
hotspots and 10.3% own 5 or more. As of May, 2021, the maximum
number of hotspots owned by a single owner is 1,903. Contrast this
with March, 2021, when the maximum was 160. The majority of
hotspots are located in the US, and the second most common region
is western Europe. While there are a modest number of large-scale
owners, it is fair to claim that ownership (by unique wallets at least)
of the Helium hotspot infrastructure today is decentralized.
We next investigate several of the larger hotspot pools. A com-
mon inference from HNT balances over time is that owners which
are using Helium in service of a real-world, end application engage
in a large number of data transactions and have thousands to tens
of thousands of HNT in their account. In contrast, owners which
do not take part in data transactions generally have low HNT in
their accounts as they frequently encash their HNT. These owners
appear to be using the network as means for gaining profit rather
than supporting their own edge devices. Next, we look at a few
examples of each of these classes of owner.

(b) Number of hotspots transferred per owner.
(c) Hotspot transfer transactions over time.
Figure 7: Resale market analysis. About 95.4% of the total hotspots transferred do not change owners more than 2 times as seen in (a).
This shows that once hotspots are transferred they do not have a tendency to change ownership. In (b), we show the 200 owners which
have participated in the most hotspot transfers either purchasing or selling them. These owners account for about 10% of the total owners
who have participated in carrying out these transactions. Over time there is growth in the number of owners participating in these hotspot
transfer transactions as seen in (c). There were a total of 3,819 such transactions over a span of 6 months.
4.3.3 Resale Market. Enthusiasm for Helium, coupled with the
global electronics shortage [20] as well as the general manufactur-
ing latency of new-to-market products, has resulted in a shortage of
hotspots. The original Helium hotspot sold for $500 USD and newer,
Helium-sanctioned third-party hotspots cost around $300-400 USD.
An informal survey of the resale market finds a median price of
$989 USD for a Helium hotspot among the top twenty eBay listings
(min: $405, max: $6,500).
Some of the resale market is new, unopened hotspots. We cannot
track sales of those hotspots. However, Helium also supports a
transfer_hotspot transaction, which allows one user to sell an
established hotspot to another. Figure 7 analyzes hotspots and
owners involved in resale transactions. About 8.6% of the total
hotspots deployed are transferred to another owner. Over 95.8%
of hotspot transfer transactions transfer 0 DC between buyer and
seller, which suggests that the majority of resale payments take
place using an off-chain marketplace, such as eBay; although it is
not clear what ensures sellers actually relinquish ownership of the
hotspot to buyers in such markets.
5 HOW MUCH IS BUILT ON HELIUM TODAY?
Next, we seek to understand what types of users and applications
are running on the Helium network today. Our analysis reveals that
currently Helium remains highly speculative, with more handlers
deploying hotspots than users using Helium to ferry data. This
is perhaps not surprising. The design of Helium’s coverage-based
reward model is to break into the chicken-and-egg problem of ‘no
users to pay for infrastructure’ and ‘no infrastructure to support
possible users.’ Still, we find a small but steady growth in what
appears to be real-world application traffic, that suggests that ‘if
[Helium] can build it, they will come.’
5.1 How does payment-for-data actually work?
Data transfer transactions are not recorded immediately and di-
rectly to the main Helium blockchain. Instead, short-lived “state
channels” aggregate batches of packets. The purpose of state chan-
nels is to permit fast and scalable payment for individual packet
transfers, a critical facet of the Helium microtransaction model.
28
To receive data, routers must first open a state channel. A state
channel open transaction stakes DC to pay for packets that may
eventually be transferred and sets a deadline some number of
blocks9 after which the channel will be closed. Hotspots that re-
ceive a wireless packet from an edge device use the metadata in the
packet to look up the owning router and send an offer to the router
to buy the packet; the offer includes packet metadata but not yet
payload contents. A router purchases a packet by sending back a
signed offer to buy, at which point the hotspot releases the packet.
Routers are responsible for closing state channels after they
expire. The state channel close transaction (should) include every
offer to buy a packet made by the router. If a router signed an
offer but never received the packet, it omits that offer from the
close transaction. When a hotspot that did send data is left out of a
close transaction, there is a 10-block grace period for the hotspot
to a submit signed demand that amends the closing. If a hotspot
lies about sending data, routers have no recourse but to add the
hotspot to a blocklist and not make future offers to purchase its
packets. As the value of individual data transactions is quite low and
the duration of state channels is short, this discovery of malicious
hotspots does not pose significant economic risk to routers.
For our analysis of data transfer behavior, then, we are limited by
the resolution of state channel transactions. State channel duration
is decided by each router independently. As we explain in the next
section, however, nearly all traffic to date is sent on state channels
with a 240-block (roughly 2 hour) duration, which is the granularity
with which our subsequent traffic analyses are able to operate.
One additional thing to note here is that it is possible for multiple
hotspots to receive the same packet. While there is sufficient infor-
mation in the packet metadata that a router can identify duplicate
receptions, it can still choose to buy as many copies of a packet
as it wishes. Observing payment flow then is a measure of data
transferred between hotspots and routers, which may overestimate
the actual flow of data from edge devices, depending on how often
routers choose to purchase duplicate copies.

5.2 Who is running Helium routers?
Setting up a router and payment processor requires non-trivial
technical expertise. Routers must be continuously online and re-
sponsive. The LoRaMAC between edge device and gateway has two
acknowledgment windows, at precisely 1 s and 2 s after a packet
transmission. The LoRaWAN protocol dictates that routers are re-
sponsible for sending acknowledgments if requested (as it is the
router which much choose which gateway should send the acknowl-
edgment packet if multiple gateways hear the original uplink packet
from the device). Thus the cloud service must (1) learn of a proffered
packet, (2) return a signed commitment to pay, (3) receive payload
data, (4) generate an acknowledgment, and (5) send a signed com-
mitment to pay for acknowledgment to a hotspot in under 1 s (or,
with less reliability 2 s) for each data packet.
As of May 2021, there are only ten OUIs registered. OUI 1 and
OUI 2 are registered to the Helium company. Of all state channel
open/close transactions, 81.18% belong to OUI 1 and OUI 2.
As a (currently) free service, the Helium company provides the
Helium Console, which is both a Helium router as well as an inter-
face for provisioning and managing devices. The Console includes
numerous integrations that allow data collected from sensors to
flow to other services such as cloud database providers and mapping
systems. Console users are required to buy DC for their devices,
but this is purchased and used at-cost.
From an analysis perspective, this monopolistic router limits
direct insight into application users, as all data transfer payments
are from the Helium Console OUI, rather than from individual users
or applications. To fund user accounts with DC on the Console,
users can either burn their own HNT with the Console wallet
as the destination—a transaction which is visible per-user to our
analysis—or they can make a credit card purchase, in which case
the Console will acquire and burn HNT using its own account. In
practice, DC are so cheap that funding events are rare. Indeed, long
before beginning this study, our research group made a one-off
$10 USD purchase of DC (which is the minimum purchase amount
permitted by the Console) in November 2020 to support another
experiment. As of this writing, we have used less than 15% of this
purchase, despite regular use of the network by multiple research
projects and extensive use during our experiments for this work.
5.3 How much actual data is sent over Helium?
With the caveats on resolution outlined, namely state channel batch-
ing, opaque duplicate purchases, and a centralized OUI operator, we
next look to analyze the behavior of data on the Helium network.
5.3.1 Device Data Traffic. We observe the trends of the device
data traffic since 2019 to identify how much of the network is used
for data transfers. Figure 8 gives a macro view of data activity.
Most of data transfers in the earlier blocks were carried out by the
Helium Router. However, the data transfers carried out by third
party routers have recently started to increase, evidence of increased
usage of the Helium network by end applications.
Fake Data & Arbitrage. One exceptional situation occurred
5.3.2
on August 12, 2020, which is the date that DC payments first went
live on the network. We see a sharp rise in the data transfer be-
tween August 12, 2020 and Sep 6, 2020 and a sudden drop after that.
29
Figure 8: Packets transfer analysis. This shows the number of
packets paid for with each state channel closing transaction, sorted
by block. The primary trend is data paid for by OUI 1 and OUI 2, the
Helium Console, which closes a state channel roughly every 120
blocks. At around 1 min/block, aggregate user traffic is approaching
14 packets/second across the whole network.
Prior to this date, data transfer was free, and mining rewards that
would have been allocated to data transfer were instead allocated
to PoC activity. When DC payments and miner data transfer re-
wards first went live, there was no cap on the reward one received
for network data transfers. Every epoch, 32.5% of newly minted
HNT was divided among hotspots that ferried data, in proportion
to the amount of data they carried – essentially, more data transfers
would fetch you more rewards. Recall, however, that the cost of
data is fixed, creating an arbitrage opportunity among DC/USD and
HNT. Users were thus gaming the network by spamming packets
to devices they owned to increase their shared of mined HNT. The
arbitrage was stopped on August 24, 2020 with the implementation
of HIP 10 [12], though it took slightly longer for the spam packets
to fall off the network. This event remains the largest sustained
volume of data traffic carried by the Helium network to date.
6 META-INFRASTRUCTURE
In this section, we take a more holistic view of the Helium network
and networking at large. We are interested to understand what
infrastructure the Helium infrastructure relies on, and whether
there are hidden points of centralization in this otherwise decen-
tralized network. We find that despite the wide array of individuals
deploying hotspots, the Helium network has potential choke points.
6.1 What ISPs do Hotspots Rely On?
One such example of a choke point is a region’s reliance on ISPs. As
all Helium hotspots are currently miners, they all participate in one,
large p2p network.10 We use the zannotate utility [4] together with
10We note that there is a limited window of time for this analysis. With the impending
launch of validator nodes, hotspots will have the option to convert to so-called “light”
nodes. Only the validators will maintain a fully connected p2p graph, and thus only
they will have access to the network information of some hotspots in the future.

Figure 10: Relay nodes with 𝑛 peer nodes. Most hotspots relay
only a few nodes. The cause of high-relay nodes is unknown.
Figure 9: Distribution of ASNs for hotspots (with public IPs).
Sorted by the number of hotspots per ASN, the overwhelming
majority of hotspots hang off of just a few networks, although there
is a very long tail of ASNs with just one or two hotspots.
Route Views data to identify the ASN of all non-relayed hotspots (i.e.
hotspots with public IP addresses) connected to the p2p network.
In total, Helium hotspots are deployed in 454 ASNs. Figure 9
shows the complete distribution of these ASNs and Table 1 shows
the top 15 ISPs derived from the ASNs using CAIDA’s as2org
dataset [2]. We find that the most widely-used ISP is Spectrum
