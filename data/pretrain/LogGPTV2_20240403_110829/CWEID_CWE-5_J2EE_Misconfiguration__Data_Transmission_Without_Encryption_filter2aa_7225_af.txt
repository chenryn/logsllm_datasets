### CWEID:CWE-363 Race Condition Enabling Link Following
title_zh:使用共享资源的并发执行不恰当同步问题（竞争条件）

### CWEID:CWE-366 Race Condition within a Thread
title_zh:上下文切换时的竞争条件
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.
### CWEID:CWE-368 Context Switching Race Condition
title_zh:信号处理例程中的竞争条件
A product performs a series of non-atomic actions to switch between contexts that cross privilege or other security boundaries, but a race condition allows an attacker to modify or misrepresent the product's behavior during the switch.
### CWEID:CWE-370 Missing Check for Certificate Revocation after Initial Check
title_zh:Switch语句中的竞争条件
The product does not check the revocation status of a certificate after its initial revocation check, which can cause the product to perform privileged actions even after the certificate is revoked at a later time.
### CWEID:CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
title_zh:单线程内的竞争条件
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.
### CWEID:CWE-372 Incomplete Internal State Distinction
title_zh:检查时间与使用时间(TOCTOU)的竞争条件
The product does not properly determine which state it is in, causing it to assume it is in state X when in fact it is in state Y, causing it to perform incorrect operations in a security-relevant manner.

### CWEID:CWE-374 Passing Mutable Objects to an Untrusted Method
title_zh:传递不可变的对象给非可信方法
The product sends non-cloned mutable data as an argument to a method or function.
### CWEID:CWE-378 Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions

The product detects a specific error, but takes no actions to handle the error.
### CWEID:CWE-384 Session Fixation
title_zh:隐蔽时间通道
Authenticating a user, or otherwise establishing a new user session, without invalidating any existing session identifier gives an attacker the opportunity to steal authenticated sessions.
### CWEID:CWE-385 Covert Timing Channel

Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.
### CWEID:CWE-391 Unchecked Error Condition
title_zh:符号名称未能映射到正确对象
[PLANNED FOR DEPRECATION. SEE MAINTENANCE NOTES AND CONSIDER :CWE-252:, :CWE-248:, OR :CWE-1069:.] Ignoring exceptions and other error conditions may allow an attacker to induce unexpected behavior unnoticed.

### CWEID:CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
title_zh:在移除最后引用时对内存的释放不恰当（内存泄露）
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.
### CWEID:CWE-403 Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')
title_zh:将私有的资源传输到一个新的空间（资源泄露）

title_zh:将文件描述符暴露给不受控制的范围（文件描述符泄露）
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."
### CWEID:CWE-406 Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)

### CWEID:CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
title_zh:算法复杂性
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.
### CWEID:CWE-408 Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification
title_zh:对高度压缩数据的处理不恰当（数据放大攻击）
The product allows an entity to perform a legitimate but expensive operation before authentication or authorization has taken place.
### CWEID:CWE-410 Insufficient Resource Pool
title_zh:不充分的资源池
The product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.
### CWEID:CWE-414 Missing Lock Check
title_zh:双重释放
A product does not check to see if a lock is present before performing sensitive operations on a resource.
### CWEID:CWE-412 Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock

### CWEID:CWE-422 Unprotected Windows Messaging Channel ('Shatter')
title_zh:当访问候选通道时的竞争条件
The product does not properly verify the source of a message in the Windows Messaging System while running at elevated privileges, creating an alternate channel through which an attacker can directly send a message to the product.
### CWEID:CWE-420 Unprotected Alternate Channel

### CWEID:CWE-428 Unquoted Search Path or Element
title_zh:未经引用的搜索路径或元素
The product uses a search path that contains an unquoted element, in which the element contains whitespace or other separators. This can cause the product to access resources in a parent path.
### CWEID:CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element
