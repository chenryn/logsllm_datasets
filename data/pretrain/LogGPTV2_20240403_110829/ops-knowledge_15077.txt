User: How to uncompress a tar.gz file using Linux command line tools? Please provide specific commands and parameters.
Assistant: To decompress a tar.gz file, you need to use the tar command combined with the gzip compression tool. The specific commands and parameters are as follows: tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz Among them, the meanings of the parameters are as follows: - z: use gzip to compress/decompress; - x: decompress the file; - v: display detailed information, that is, decompress The file name during the compression process; - f: specifies the file to be decompressed. It should be noted that if the compressed file name contains path information, you need to pay attention to the correctness of the path when decompressing. For example, if the compressed file is /home/user/test.tar.gz, you need to execute the above command in the directory you want to decompress when decompressing, otherwise the file will be decompressed to an incorrect location.
