Abstract 
We  describe  a  specific  application  of  assurance  cases  to 
the  problem  of  ensuring  that  a  transition  from  a  legacy 
system  to  its  replacement  will  not  compromise  mission 
assurance objectives. The application in question was the 
transition  of  the  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  to  a 
new  ground-control  system.  The  transition,  which  took 
place over five days, required uninterrupted control of the 
GPS  satellite  constellation  while  control  was  transferred 
from a 1970s-era mainframe to a distributed architecture. 
We  created  an  assurance  case  so  that  the  procedural 
documentation we had  could  be  restructured  into  a  form 
amenable  to  analysis.  The  analysis  concluded  that  there 
were no major hazards; this conclusion was validated by 
a successful transition. 
1. Introduction 
On  September  14,  2007,  the  U.S.  Air  Force  replaced 
the  ground-control  system  for  the  Global  Positioning 
System  (GPS)  [1].  The  new  system,  known  as  the 
Architecture  Evolution  Plan  (AEP),  replaced  a  legacy 
control system (referred to as Legacy)  built  on  1970s-era 
mainframe computers. Since GPS is used worldwide as  a 
navigation  aid,  it  was  essential  that  the  transition  was 
executed without disrupting the GPS navigation signals. 
The  Air  Force  asked  The  Aerospace  Corporation  to 
analyze the AEP transition plan from a mission assurance 
perspective and document any risks that were discovered. 
The  scope  of  this  assessment  was  limited  to  the  ground-
control system as replacement of the system was intended 
to be transparent to the GPS satellites. 
We  chose  to  use  an  assurance  case,  expressed  in  the 
Goal  Structuring  Notation  (GSN)  [2],  to  structure  the 
assessment. We had experience with assurance cases, and 
believed  that  GSN  would  support  our  assessment  goals. 
This  assurance  case  was  unique  in  that  it  focused  on  the 
transition  to  the  new  system  and  not  the  system  itself. 
Legacy was assumed to provide adequate service based on 
its service history. AEP was assumed to provide adequate 
service  based  on  other  analyses.  The  challenge  we  faced 
consisted 
in  this  work  was  in  applying  a  technique  intended  for  a 
system  made  up  of  states  to  a  process  made  up  of  steps; 
the  system  states  were  not  defined  explicitly  in  our 
documentation,  which 
operational 
procedures. Our solution was to define a series of phases 
composed  of  sets  of  process  steps.    In  each  phase,  the 
system was defined as having a single state. The states we 
constructed  reflected  the  gradual  shift  in  responsibility 
from  Legacy  to  AEP.  We  hypothesized  that  restructuring 
our procedural documentation into a state-based argument 
would make it easier to find risks in the transition plan. 
of 
The assurance case demonstrated to the Air Force that 
the transition posed no major mission assurance concerns. 
The  most  significant  finding  was  lack  of  documentation 
for  some  procedures;  we  later  established  that  the 
documentation  was  available 
in  another  form.  The 
strength of the assurance case, along with the many other 
tests  and  analyses 
to  ensure 
continuity  of  service  during  and  after  the  transition, 
contributed to the decision to proceed with the transition.

Some  of  the  specifics  of  the  system  and  its  assurance 
case  have  been  adapted  for  publication.  The  alterations 
abstract away some detail but do not alter the substance. 
2. The GPS System 
The GPS system includes: a constellation of at least 24 
satellites,  which  provide 
time  and  position  signals 
(navigation  messages)  to  users  [3];  a  ground  control 
system;  and  user  GPS  receivers.  The  transition  involved 
the  Operational  Control  System  (OCS),  part  of  the 
ground-control  system,  which  consists  of:  (1)  the  Master 
Control  Station  (MCS),  the  central  facility  for  satellite 
control; (2) monitoring stations that monitor the accuracy 
of  the  navigation  messages;  and  (3)  ground  antennas, 
which  receive  telemetry  (status  information)  from  the 
satellites and upload commands or data when necessary. 
Figure 1 shows a simplified view of GPS as a closed-
loop  system  for  minimizing  navigation  error.  The 
navigation  messages  are  received  at  the  monitoring 
stations  at  precisely  surveyed  locations.  At  the  MCS,

location  errors  and  clock  offsets  are  calculated  from  this 
data. Next, Kalman filters are used to predict future orbit 
and clock offsets. The MCS then transmits the predictions 
to  the  ground  antennas,  which  upload  the  predictions  to 
the satellites. The satellites then use these data to generate 
the  navigation  messages.  The  feedback  occurs  when  the 
monitoring  stations  transmit  measured  signal  parameters 
back  to  the  MCS,  which  then  recalculates  the  orbit  and 
clock parameters for the next message cycle.

Feedback loop 
The  primary  function  of  the  OCS  is  to  support  the 
navigation  message  feedback  loop.  It  also:  (1)  supports 
telemetry,  tracking,  and  commanding  of  the  satellites  to 
keep  them  in  the  appropriate  orbits;  (2)  provides  data  to 
the  National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency  (NGA), 
which  also  monitors  the  navigation  signal,  and  to  other 
U.S.  Government  agencies;  and  (3)  provides  diagnostic 
data to the GPS satellite manufacturers. 
Because  of  the  importance  of  the  navigation  uploads, 
the  OCS  Kalman  filter  results  contained  in  the  upload 
message  were  a  key  issue  of  the  study.  Both  Legacy  and 
AEP  use  the  same  filtering  algorithm,  but  they  provide 
slightly  different  results  under  some  circumstances.  The 
concerns  were  that  either  AEP’s  implementation  would 
not be sufficiently accurate, or the slight difference would 
cause a discontinuity in received data when the first AEP 
uploads to the satellites occurred. The assurance case also 
addressed  the  continuity  and  correctness  of  telemetry, 
tracking and commanding  functions  and  data  provided  to 
external interfaces.  
3. The OCS Transition 
To maintain uninterrupted control of the GPS satellite 
constellation during the transition, taking the OCS offline 
was  unacceptable.  Instead,  the  transition  entailed  parallel 
operation of the Legacy and AEP systems  as  control  was 
transferred incrementally to AEP. This process was called 
the  Enhanced  Phased  Operations  Transition  (EPOT);  it 
consisted  of  four  increments,  or  phases.  Each  phase  had 
specific  entry  and  exit  criteria.  The  EPOT  phases,  along 
with  the  assurance  objectives  that  needed  to  be  met  for 
those phases, are listed in Table 1.

Phase Description 
Legacy  is  the  source  of  operational  data,  and  AEP  has  not  yet 
been physically connected to operational portions of the system. 
Legacy is the source of operational data, but AEP is performing 
calculations to shadow Legacy. AEP shadows Legacy to provide 
sufficient time for AEP’s Kalman filters to be synchronized with 
Legacy’s and to provide a final test of AEP functionality. 
AEP  is  the  source  of  operational  data,  but  it  does  not  yet  have 
control  of  ground  antennas  or  monitoring  stations.  Legacy  can 
use  ground  antennas  and  monitoring  stations 
to  resume 
operation if AEP exhibits anomalies. 
AEP is the operational source of data, and operational control of 
ground  antennas  and  monitoring  stations  is  being  transferred  to 
AEP.  At  the  end  of  the  phase,  AEP  has  complete  control  of 
interfaces. 
Assurance Objective 
None needed; Legacy is assumed to provide  adequate 
service. AEP is silent and so cannot interfere.

Parallel  operation  of 
the 
two  systems  required 
duplicating  connections  to  outside  data  sources.  Input 
from the monitoring stations was needed to provide signal 
error  data  to  the  Kalman  filters  running  in  both  systems; 
NGA data was also available, but the filters needed to be 
trained on the same data to be comparable. During Phases 
0-2,  Legacy  forwarded  the  monitoring  station  data  to 
AEP.  At  the  beginning  of  Phase  3,  Legacy’s  monitoring 
station  connection  was  terminated  so  that  the  monitoring 
stations could be transferred to AEP control. At this point, 
the  AEP  Kalman  filters  would  start  to  diverge  from  the 
Legacy filters because of the difference in data sources.  
Only one version of the system could be connected to 
the  ground  antennas  at  a  time.  AEP  used  an  alternate 
transmission  facility  for  EPOT  Phase  2  before  assuming 
control of the ground antennas in Phase 3.

4. Transition Assessment 
took 
Our  assessment  was  conducted  by  two  of  the  authors 
and 
three  person-months.  Other  staff  of  The 
Aerospace Corporation assisted with the assurance case as 
needed, including two domain experts. One expert had 23 
years of experience with the GPS  ground  control  system; 
both had been involved in AEP’s development. 
functional 
redundancy 
The  assessment  was  conducted  at  a  relatively  high 
level of abstraction, both  because  of  time  constraints  and 
because 
the  system  and 
procedures  meant  that  the  correct  operation  of  any 
particular  system  mechanism  was  not  critical.  The 
assessment  considered  the  system  as  a  whole;  it  was 
complemented  by  other,  more  focused  studies  and  by 
transition rehearsals. 
in 
The  assurance  case  went  through  multiple  review 
cycles by software colleagues and domain experts until we 
were satisfied that no unaddressed argument goal posed a 
significant risk to transition success.  
4.1. Goal and Approach 
The goal of the transition assessment, derived from the 
GPS  Transition  Plan  [3],  was  to  show  that  the  transition 
would  be  conducted  so  as  to  minimize  the  operational 
impact  to  GPS  users  (that  is,  navigation  and  external 
interface  users).  An  argument  for  assurance  of  the 
transition plan was not explicitly documented prior to this 
effort;  however,  the  high-level  structure  of  the  argument 
could  be  gleaned  from  several  sources  [3,  4].  We 
constructed  an  assurance  case  to  document  the  implicit 
argument  for  the  effectiveness  of  the  transition  plan  and 
supplemented  the  preexisting  argument  with  our  own 
observations.  Specifics  of  the  assurance  case,  including 
most of the evidence used to support its claims, are based 
on a checklist that provides detailed steps to be performed 
during each transition phase.  
To  create  the  argument  structure,  we  derived  a  set  of 
system  states  from  the  checklist  and  then  argued  that  the 
system  was  safe  (1)  when  it  was  in  each  state,  and  (2) 
during  each  transition  between  states.  Our  strategy  in 
creating  the  states  was  to  consider  not  just  the  Legacy 
system or the AEP system, but the combined Legacy-AEP 
super-system for ground control.  
Creating  super-system  states  enabled  us  to  represent 
the gradual transfer of responsibility between systems as a 
set  of  sequential  state  changes.  Our  super-system 
configurations  are  composed  of  a  set  of  variables  whose 
values  represent  which  system—Legacy  or  AEP—is 
responsible  for  carrying  out  each  system  function.  It  also 
includes  variables  whose  values  represent  how  recently 
the  Kalman  data  for  each  system  was  updated  by  the 
monitoring stations, so that we could ensure that stale data 
was not used to provide service to an interface. 
We  created  a  matrix  to  relate  procedural  steps  from 
the  checklist  to  the  system  state  variables  we  identified. 
This  ensured  that  we  had  not  missed  any  transient  states. 
For  example,  we  found  a  state  where  both  Legacy  and 
AEP  controlled  an  interface;  we  then  verified  that 
operational  procedures  would  preclude  a  conflict.  We 
partitioned the matrix into regions in which  the  values  of 
the  state  variables  remained  fairly  stable  as  the  transition 
proceeded.  This  partitioning  gave  rise  to  a  sequence  of 
system  configurations  in  which  responsibilities  were 
clearly  assigned  to  either  Legacy  or  to  AEP.  Figure  2 
provides  an  example  of  where  a  partition  boundary  was 
drawn  (with  some  columns  elided  for  reasons  of  space). 
The  sequence  of  configurations  aligned  with  the  phases 
set  out  in  the  transition  plan,  validating  our  analysis  and 
providing additional confidence in the plan. 
4.2. Decomposition Strategy 
The transition phases were chosen by the contractor to 
align  with  significant  events  during  the  transition.  Our 
state  variable  analysis  also  indicated  a  correspondence
