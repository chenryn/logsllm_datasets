ABSTRACT
The 16th Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society was held
on October 30, 2017 in conjunction with the 24th ACM Conference
on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2017) in Dallas,
Texas, USA. The goal of WPES is to bring together a diverse group
of privacy researchers and practitioners to discuss privacy problems
that arise in global, interconnected societies, and potential solutions
to them. The program for the workshop contains 14 full papers
and 5 short papers selected from a total of 56 submissions. Specific
topics covered in the program include but are not limited to: de-
anonymization, fingerprinting and profiling, location privacy, and
private memory systems.

1 INTRODUCTION
The increased power and interconnectivity of computer systems
available today create the ability to store and process large amounts
of data, resulting in networked information accessible from any-
where at any time. It is becoming easier to collect, exchange, access,
process, and link information. This global scenario has inevitably
resulted in an increasing degree of awareness with respect to pri-
vacy. Privacy issues have been the subject of public debates, and
the need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and techniques
has been widely recognized.
The goal of this workshop is to discuss the problems of privacy
in global interconnected societies, as well as possible solutions to
these types of problems. The workshop seeks submissions from
academia and industry presenting novel research on all theoretical
and practical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental
studies of fielded systems. We encourage submissions from other
