I ran into an odd behaviour when taking the intersection of two Indexes.
Specifically,
    left = pd.Index(['A','B','A','C'])
    right = pd.Index(['B','D'])
    left.intersection(right)
returns
    Index(['B', 'C'], dtype='object')
However, I would expect this to return
    Index(['B'], dtype='object')
If `Index(['B', 'C'], dtype='object')` is the intended behaviour, can someone
explain the rationale behind it?
