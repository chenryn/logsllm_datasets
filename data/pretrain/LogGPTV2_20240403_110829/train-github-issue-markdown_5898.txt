Hi!
Thanks for a great & amazing library - been a very smooth ride so far building
https://github.com/iverberk/nomad-ui with react and material-ui
I'm done with the first run on the layout, and currently testing it out on
mobile.
I can't seem to find any documentation on Tabs and how they work with scroll /
overflow on mobile devices.
Is it something that is currently supported in `@stable` \- or is there any
work-arounds for it - it looks quite smashed together on an iPhone6S with just
6 tabs in use :)
Thanks again and love what you are doing!
