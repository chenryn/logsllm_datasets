Subject: Inquiry About Tab Component Behavior on Mobile Devices

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well.

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the fantastic and versatile library. My experience so far in developing [nomad-ui](https://github.com/iverberk/nomad-ui) using React and Material-UI has been exceptionally smooth and enjoyable.

I have completed the initial layout phase and am currently in the process of testing the application on mobile devices. During this testing, I encountered an issue with the Tabs component, specifically regarding its behavior with scrolling and overflow on smaller screens, such as an iPhone 6S. Even with just six tabs, the layout appears quite cramped and unappealing.

Could you kindly provide some guidance or point me towards any relevant documentation on how to properly handle the Tabs component in a mobile context? Is this feature currently supported in the `@stable` version, or are there any recommended workarounds to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing and functional display?

Thank you once again for your hard work and dedication. I truly admire the contributions you make to the developer community.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
