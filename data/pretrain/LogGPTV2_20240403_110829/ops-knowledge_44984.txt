User: Please provide a horizontally scalable distributed computing solution according to the actual needs of the laboratory.
Assistant: horizontally scalable distributed computing solution is to use a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes is an open source platform for auto-deploying, auto-scaling, and auto-managing containerized applications. It easily scales computing resources, enabling applications to automatically adjust their size as needed. In this scenario, labs can deploy containerized applications inside a Kubernetes cluster. For example, an emulator or computing application can be packaged as a container image and run in a cluster. Kubernetes automatically adjusts the number of applications based on load and distributes them across nodes to maximize resource utilization. If more computing resources are needed, more nodes can be added at any time. In addition to computing nodes, Kubernetes clusters can also deploy other applications, such as data storage, computing task management, and monitoring systems. In this way, laboratories can use a unified platform to manage all computing resources and applications, and can easily expand or reduce the size of the system. In addition, through the flexibility and scalability of Kubernetes, the laboratory can make full use of the computing resources of the public cloud platform to save costs.
