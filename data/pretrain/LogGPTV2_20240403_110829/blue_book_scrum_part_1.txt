[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) is an
[agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) framework for
developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial
emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields such
as personal task management.  It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members,
who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed
iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two
weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings,
called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to
demonstrate the work done, a sprint retrospective to improve continuously, and
a sprint planning to prepare next sprint's tasks.
For my personal scrum workflow and in the DevOps and DevSecOps teams I've found
that Sprint goals are not operative, as multiple unrelated tasks need to
be done, so it doesn't make sense to define just one goal.
# The meetings
Scrum tries to minimize the time spent in meetings while keeping a clearly
defined direction and a healthy environment between all the people involved in
the project.
To achieve that is uses four types of meetings:
* [Daily](#daily-meetings).
* [Refinement](#refinement-meetings).
* [Retros](#retro-meetings).
* [Reviews](#review-meetings).
* [Plannings](#planning-meetings).
## Daily meetings
Dailies or weeklies are the meetings where the development team exposes at high level of
detail the current work. Similar to the dailies in the scrum terms, in the
meeting each development team member exposes:
* The advances in the assigned tasks, with special interest in the encountered
    problems and deviations from the steps defined in the refinement.
* An estimation of the tasks that are going to be left unfinished by the end of
    the sprint.
The goals of the meeting are:
* Get a general knowledge of what everyone else is doing.
* Learn from the experience gained by the others while doing their tasks.
* Get a clear idea of where we stand in terms of completing the sprint tasks.
As opposed to what it may seem, this meeting is not meant to keep track of the
productivity of each of us, we work based on trust, and know that each of us is
working our best.
## Refinement meetings
Refinement are the meetings where the development team reviews the issues in the
backlog and prepares the tasks that will probably be done in the following
sprint.
The goals of the meeting are:
* Next sprint tasks are ready to be worked upon in the next sprint. That means
    each task:
    * Meets the Definition of Ready.
    * All disambiguation in task description, validation criteria and steps
        is solved.
* Make the Planning meeting more dynamic.
The meeting is composed of the following phases:
* Scrum master preparation.
* Development team refinement.
* Product owner refinement.
### Refinement preparation
To prepare the refinement, the scrum master has to:
* Make a copy of the [Refinement document template](refinement_template.md).
* Open the OKRs document if you have one and for category in OKR categories:
  * Select the category label in the issue tracker and select the milestone of
      the semester.
  * Review which of those issues might enter the next sprint, and set the sprint
      project on them.
  * Remove the milestone from the issue filter to see if there are interesting
      issues without the milestone set.
* Go to the next sprint Kanban board:
  * Order the issues by priority.
  * Make sure there are tasks with the `Good first issue` label.
  * Make sure that there are more tasks than we can probably do so we can remove
      some instead of need to review the backlog and add more in the
      refinement.
* Fill up the sprint goals section of the refinement document.
* Create the Refinement developer team and product owner meeting calendar
    events.
### Development team refinement meeting
In this meeting the development team with the help of the scrum master, reviews
the tasks to be added to the next sprint. The steps are defined in the
refinement template.
### Product owner refinement meeting
In this meeting the product owner with the help of the scrum master reviews
the tasks to be added to the next sprint. With the refinement document as
reference:
* The expected current sprint undone tasks are reviewed.
* The sprint goals are discussed, modified and agreed. If there are many
    changes, we might think of setting the goals together in next sprints.
* The scrum master does a quick description of each issue.
* Each task priority is discussed and updated.
## Retro meetings
Retrospectives or Retros are the meetings where the scrum team plan ways to
increase the quality and effectiveness of the team.
The scrum master conducts different dynamics to help the rest of the scrum team
inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions,
processes, tools, and their Definition of Done and Ready. Assumptions that led
them astray are identified and their origins explored. The most impactful
improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the
backlog for the next sprint.
Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the sprint
retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and
adaptation.
The sprint retrospective concludes the sprint.
The meeting consists of five phases, all of them conducted by the scrum master:
* *Set the stage*: There is an opening dynamic to give people time to “arrive”
    and get into the right mood.
* *Gather Data*: Help everyone remember. Create a shared pool of information
    (everybody sees the world differently). There is an initial dynamic to
    measure the general feeling of the team and the issues to analyze further.
* *Generate insights*: Analyze why did things happen the way they did, identify
    patterns and see the big picture.
* *Decide what to do*: Pick a few issues to work on and create concrete action
    plans of how you’ll address them. Adding the as issues in the scrum board.
* *Close the retrospective*: Clarify follow-ups, show appreciations, leave the
    meeting with a general good feeling, and analyze how could the
    retrospectives improve.
If you have no idea how to conduct this meeting, you can take ideas from
[retromat](https://retromat.org).
The goals of the meeting are:
* Analyze and draft a plan to iteratively improve the team's well-being, quality
    and efficiency.
## Review meetings
Reviews are the meetings where the product owner presents the sprint work to the
rest of the team and the stakeholders. The idea of what is going to be done in
the next sprint is also defined in this meeting.
The meeting goes as follows:
* The product owner explains what items have been “Done” and what has not been
    “Done”.
* The product owner discuss what went well during the sprint, what problems they
    ran into, and how those problems were solved.
* The developers demonstrate the work that it has “Done” and answers questions.
* The product owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands in terms of the
    semester OKRs.
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review
    provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning.
As the target audience are the stakeholders, the language must be changed
accordingly, we should give overall ideas and not get caught in complicated high
tech detailed explanations unless they ask them.
The goals of the meeting are:
* Increase the transparency on what the team has done in the sprint. By
    explaining to the stake holders:
    * What has been done.
    * The reasons why we've implemented the specific outcomes for the tasks.
    * The deviation from the expected plan of action.
    * The status of the unfinished tasks with an explanation of why weren't they
        closed.
    * The meaning of the work done in terms of the semester OKRs.
* Increase the transparency on what the team plans to do for the following
    sprint by explaining to the stakeholders:
    * What do we plan to do in the next semester.
    * How we plan to do it.
    * The meaning of the plan in terms of the semester OKRs.
* Get the feedback from the stakeholders. We expect to gather and process their
    feedback by processing their opinions both of the work done of the past
    sprint and the work to be done in the next one. It will be gathered by the
    scrum master and persisted in the board on the planning meetings.
* Incorporate the stakeholders in the decision making process of the team. By
    inviting them to define with the rest of the scrum team the tasks for the
    next sprint.
## Planning meetings
Plannings are the meetings where the scrum team decides what it's going to do in
the following sprint. The decision is made with the information gathered in the
refinement, retro and review sessions.
Conducted by the scrum master, usually only the members of the scrum team
(developers, product owner and scrum master) are present, but stakeholders can
also be invited.
If the job has been done in the previous sessions, the backlog should be
priorized and refined, so we should only add the newest issues gathered in the
retro and review, refine them and decide what we want to do this sprint.
The meeting goes as follows:
* We add the issues raised in the review to the backlog.
* We analyze the tasks on the top of the backlog, add them to the sprint
    board without assigning it to any developer.
* Once all tasks are added, we the stats of past sprints to see if the scope is
    realistic.
The goals of the meeting are:
* Assert that the tasks added to the sprint follow the global path defined by
