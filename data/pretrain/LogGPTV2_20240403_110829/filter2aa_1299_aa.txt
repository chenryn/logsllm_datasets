**Sun Tzu: The Original Hacker?**
- Sun Wu (Tzu) wrote "Ping-fa" (The Art of War).
- A key quote from Sun Tzu: "One who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred engagements. One who does not know the enemy but knows himself will sometimes be victorious, sometimes meet with defeat. One who knows neither the enemy nor himself will invariably be defeated in every engagement."

### China: The Terrell Owens of Cyber-War
- **Definition of Red Hacker Alliance:**
  - A Chinese nationalist hacker network composed of many independent websites linked together. These sites educate members on computer attack and intrusion techniques. The group is known for launching coordinated attacks against foreign governments and entities to protest perceived injustices. There is a growing trend towards monetary motivations.

- **Timeline:**
  - **1997:** Formation of the Green Army by GoodWell (China).
  - **1998:** Anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia catalyze the creation of the Red Hacker Alliance.
  - **2000:** Honker Union of China founded by Lion, China Eagle Union by Wan Tao, and Javaphile by Coolswallow and Blhuang.
  - **2001:** Sino-US cyber conflict: 1000 web defacements protesting the death of a Chinese pilot.

- **Statistics:**
  - Visiting 90 out of 250 sites that kept statistics showed a total of 1,197,769 registered members. The range is from a minimum of 24,000 to a maximum of around 1.2 million. During times of political strife, these numbers likely increase dramatically.

### Locked and Loaded
- **Red Hacker Alliance Sites:**
  - The Friendly Download Site (http://www.xxijj.com) claims to have 69,951 downloads, including Trojan horses and attack tools. It also hosts the newest 2005 version of the Gray Pigeon Trojan, an updated version used in the 1999 Cyber Conflict with Taiwan.
  - In June 2005, the National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC) reported Trojan email attacks targeting UK government and companies. The attacks were traced to the Far East, and Trojans used included Gray Pigeon and Nethief, both credited to Chinese hackers.

### Citizen Soldier
- **Cultural Perspective:**
  - Our initial inquiry is viewed through a US paradigm, applying cultural bias. In Chinese society, independence from government direction does not mean separation from the state. The PRC government views its citizens as integral to Comprehensive National Power and national security.
  - From a Western perspective, active espionage requires government initiative. However, there may be a non-traditional association between the central government and the Red Hacker Alliance.

### Itâ€™s All About the Mao (Yuan)
- **Example:**
  - An interview with a Beijing hacker reveals that Chinese officials approached him for help in obtaining classified information from foreign governments. He refused but admitted to scanning a top US general's personal documents for fun. He also acknowledged that Chinese companies now hire hackers for industrial espionage, driven by financial incentives.

### From Russia with...
- **Russian Cyber Capabilities:**
  - Moscow conducts arms business with over 70 countries and exported $6 billion worth of arms in 2006. Russian intelligence services have a history of employing hackers, such as Markus Hess in 1985.
  - **Estimate of Russia's Cyber Capabilities:**
    - Military Budget: $40 Billion USD
    - Global Rating in Cyber Capabilities: Tied at Number 4
    - Cyber Warfare Budget: $127 Million USD
    - Offensive Cyber Capabilities: 4.1 (1 = Low, 3 = Moderate, 5 = Significant)

- **Cyber Weapons Arsenal:**
  - Large, advanced BotNet for DDoS and espionage
  - Electromagnetic pulse weapons (non-nuclear)
  - Compromised counterfeit computer software
  - Advanced dynamic exploitation capabilities
  - Wireless data communications jammers
  - Cyber Logic Bombs
  - Computer viruses and worms
  - Cyber data collection exploits
  - Computer and networks reconnaissance tools
  - Embedded Trojan time bombs (suspected)

- **Cyber Force Size:**
  - 7,300+
  - Broadband Connections: 23.8 Million+

### Russia vs. Estonia
- **Estonian Cyberwar:**
  - Series of cyber attacks began on April 27, 2007, targeting Estonian organizations, including parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters. The attacks were in response to the relocation of a Soviet-era memorial in Tallinn. Most attacks were DDoS, ranging from ping floods to botnet rentals. Spamming and defacement of websites, including the Estonian Reform Party site, also occurred.

### Russia vs. Georgia
- **Georgian Cyberattacks:**
  - Stories are still evolving. Estonia, once a victim of Russian-based hackers, is now hosting Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website and sending cyberdefense advisors to Georgia.
  - The strikes include physical attacks on telecommunications infrastructure, such as cell towers. Many DoS attacks directed against Georgia came from the United States rather than Russia.

### Russia vs. ???
- **FSB and Russian Software Industry:**
  - The FSB is the internal counter-intelligence agency of the Russian Federation. Russia produces 200,000 scientific and technology graduates annually, comparable to India's output. A World Bank study states that over one million people are involved in software R&D. The 2007 cyber attack on Estonia highlighted Russia's advanced cyber warfare capabilities.
  - Conclusion: Russia has the intent and technological capabilities to carry out cyber attacks globally.

- **Russian Business Network:**
  - Security researchers and anti-spam groups identify the St. Petersburg-based Russian Business Network as a significant player in cybercrime.
