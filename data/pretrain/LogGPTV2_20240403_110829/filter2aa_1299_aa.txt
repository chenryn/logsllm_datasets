Yes Sun Tzu was a hacker!
• Sun Wu (Tzu) “Ping-fa”(The Art of War)
• “Thus it is said that one who knows the enemy and 
knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred 
engagements. One who does not know the enemy but 
knows himself will sometimes be victorious, sometimes 
meet with defeat. One who knows neither the enemy nor 
himself will invariably be defeated in every engagement!”

CHINA 
(The Terrell Owens of cyber-war)
• Definition of Red Hacker Alliance:
•
A Chinese nationalist hacker network, made up of 
many independent web sites directly linked to one 
another in which individual sites educate their 
members on computer attack and intrusion 
techniques.  The group is characterized by launching 
coordinated attacks against foreign governments 
and entities to protest actual and perceived 
injustices done to their nation.  There is a growing 
trend that suggests monetary motivations are 
becoming as important as patriotic passion. 
They started without us
• 1997 Formation of the Green Army Founded by 
GoodWell (China)
• 1998 Anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia provide the 
catalyst for the creation of the Red Hacker 
Alliance.
• 2000  Honker Union of China founded by Lion 
China Eagle Union founded by Wan Tao  
Javaphile founded by Coolswallow and Blhuang
• 2001 Sino-US cyber conflict 1000 web 
defacement protesting death of Chinese pilot.
73% of all statistics are made up. 
(But still OUCH)
• Visiting each of the 90 sites that kept statistics 
(out of 250 sites looked at) and then adding up 
the total number of registered members showed 
a total of 1,197,769 participants. 
• The range therefore would be from a minimum 
of 24,000 to a maximum of around 1.2 million.
•
It is probable that during times of political strife, 
these numbers rise dramatically higher and 
move closer to the upper ranges.
Locked and Loaded
•
One of the sites directly linked to the Red Hacker Alliance and operating out 
of the Green Power Bar is the Friendly Download Site (http://www.xxijj.com).  
It claims to have 69,951 downloads available, many of which are Trojan 
horses and attack tools.  The Friendly Download Site also has the newest 
2005 version of the Gray Pigeon Trojan.  This is an updated version of the 
same Gray Pigeon Trojan that was discussed in Chapter One and used 
during the 1999 Cyber Conflict with Taiwan.  Its design is based on the 
Glacier Trojan and is an indigenously produced product. 
•
In June of 2005, the National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre 
(NISCC)108 released a report detailing Trojan e-mail attacks targeting 
United Kingdom “government and companies.”  The briefing noted that the 
attacks were coming from the “Far-East” and Trojans used in the attack 
included Gray Pigeon and Nethief.109  Chinese hackers have taken credit 
for the creation of both of these two Trojan programs.

The central problem with our initial inquiry and the thinking behind it is that 
we are viewing the situation from a US paradigm and applying cultural bias.  
In Chinese society, independence from government direction and control 
does not carry with it the idea of separation from the state.  The PRC 
government views its citizenry as an integral part of Comprehensive 
National Power and a vital component to national security. 
•
From a Western perspective, the idea of active espionage against another 
nation requires government initiative, involvement, and direction.  It is hard 
for us to conceive of links being formed between state authorities and quasi-
freelance intelligence operations, simply because it does not fit our 
preconceived notion of the proper relationship.  When in fact, there is a very 
good chance this is exactly the type of association that is taking place 
between the central government and the Red Hacker Alliance.
It’s all about the Mao’s (yuan) baby
•
An interview with a Chinese hacker from Beijing provides an 
excellent example of this “nontraditional” relationship:  
•
“One Beijing hacker says two Chinese officials approached him a 
couple of years ago requesting „help in obtaining classified 
information‟ from foreign governments. He says he refused the 
„assignment,‟ but admits he perused a top US general's personal 
documents once while scanning for weaknesses in Pentagon 
information systems „for fun.‟ The hacker, who requested anonymity 
to avoid detection, acknowledges that Chinese companies now hire 
people like him to conduct industrial espionage. „It used to be that 
hackers wouldn't do that because we all had a sense of social 
responsibility,‟ says the well-groomed thirty something, „but now 
people do anything for money.‟”158 
From Russia with ….
•
An interesting point to keep in mind is that Moscow does the arms business 
with over 70 countries, including China, Iran, and Venezuela, and in 2006 
exported $6 billion worth of arms. Russian intelligence services have a 
history of employing hackers against the United States. In 1985 the KGB 
hired Markus Hess, an East German hacker, to attack U.S. defense 
agencies in the infamous case of the “Cuckoo's Egg”.

Russia VS. Estonia
(or just getting warmed up)
•
Cyberattacks on Estonia (also known as the Estonian Cyberwar) 
refers to a series of cyber attacks that began April 27, 2007 and 
swamped websites of Estonian organizations, including Estonian 
parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers and broadcasters, amid 
the country's row with Russia about relocation of a Soviet-era 
memorial to fallen soldiers, as well as war graves in Tallinn.[1] Most 
of the attacks that had any influence on general public were 
distributed denial of service type attacks ranging from single 
individuals using various low-tech methods like ping floods to 
expensive rentals of botnets usually used for spam distribution. 
Spamming of bigger news portals commentaries and defacements 
including that of the Estonian Reform Party website also occurred.[2]
Russia VS. Georgia
(Military precision or an excuse for poor infrastructure?)
•
The stories are still coming in and still changing or evolving depending if you 
listen to n3td3v or not.
•
Meanwhile, Estonia (once the victim of Russian-based hackers) is now 
hosting Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. And "in a historic first, 
Estonia is sending cyberdefense advisors to Georgia," Network World 
observes.
•
And, of course, the strikes aren't just made up of ones and zeros. The 
Russians are reportedly bombing Georgia's telecommunications 
infrastructure -- including cell towers. "It's still very difficult to get a call 
anywhere around the country right now," an NPR reporter says. 
•
When political tensions flared last month between Georgia and its large 
neighbor to the north, the country was ready to block Internet traffic from 
Russia, hoping to avoid the denial-of-service attacks that shut down Internet 
service in Estonia for several days in 2007. Instead, most of the DoS 
attacks that were directed against Georgia came from an unlikely place: the 
United States.
Russia VS. ????
•
The FSB is the internal counter intelligence agency of the Russian Federation and 
successor to the Soviet KGB. Russia is often overlooked as a significant player in the 
global software industry. Russia produces 200,000 scientific and technology 
graduates each year. This is as many as India, which has five times the population. 
This is hard to believe since their software industry can be traced back to the 1950s.
•
A study by the World Bank stated that more than one million people are involved in 
software research and development. Russia has the potential to become one of the 
largest IT markets in Europe. The Russian hacker attack on Estonia in 2007 rang the 
alarm bell. Nations around the world can no longer ignore the advanced threat that 
Russia's cyber warfare capabilities have today and the ones they aspire to have in 
the near future.
•
From this information, one can only conclude that Russia has advanced capabilities 
and the intent and technological capabilities necessary to carry out a cyber attack 
anywhere in the world at any time.
