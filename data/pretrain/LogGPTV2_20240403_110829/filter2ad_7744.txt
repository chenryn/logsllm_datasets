ABSTRACT
In this paper, the use of structural behavior of communi-
cation protocols in designing new covert channels is inves-
tigated. In this way, a new covert transmitter is designed
based on a modiﬁed CSMA protocol that enables the trans-
mitter to embed a covert message in its overt traﬃc. The
proposed scheme provides high covert rate without compro-
mising the stealthiness of the channel.

INTRODUCTION
Covert communication often refers to the process of com-
municating through a channel that is neither designed, nor
intended to transfer data [1]. Covert channels may be used
to allow information to be leaked to an unauthorized recipi-
ent by exploiting weaknesses in conventional communication
systems. Kemmer [1] identiﬁed three necessary conditions
for existence of a covert channel. (i) a global resource that is
shared between the transmitter and the receiver, (ii) ability
to modify the shared resource, and (iii) a method to achieve
synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver.
The wireless channel provides all three conditions making
it a perfect medium for a covert channel.
In [2] a covert
channel based on jamming over slotted ALOHA was intro-
duced. Later, a covert channel that exploits the properties
of splitting tree collision resolution algorithm was proposed
in [3]. Wang et al. extended the aforementioned approach
into an anonymous covert channel [4] in which the receiver
decodes the message using a voting approach that considers
the probabilistic decisions of multiple covert transmitters.
Although the above schemes provide stealth covert chan-
nels, they trade the achievable covert rate in favor of the
channel secrecy. Moreover, in order to avoid detection, these
schemes are designed based on keeping the covert transmit-
ter’s long-term statistical characteristics as close as possible
to an ordinary transmitter. However, to achieve this goal,
the transmitter has to deviate from short-term behaviors of
a regular source which may be used by a system observer to
uncover the existence of the covert channel.

probability of a successful transmission by members
of the covert set.
In this paper, we present a new approach that system-
atically exploits the probabilistic nature of multiple access
protocols in order to open a covert channel in the system.
To this end, we turn our attention to the carrier sense mul-
tiple access (CSMA) protocol and design a covert transmit-
ter that mimics the characteristics of a regular CSMA node
while communicates covertly with the covert receiver.
2. COVERT CHANNEL DESIGN
In principle, the proposed covert channel beneﬁts from the
channel activities of a subset of users in the system (i.e., the
covert set) as the mean of synchronization, and the covert
transmitter’s overt traﬃc is used in order to modify the
shared medium. The design is based on a modiﬁed version of
the CSMA protocol that gives the transmitter enough free-
dom to embed the covert message into its overt traﬃc, yet
the transmitter reacts to the network events (e.g., collision)
similar to an ordinary CSMA node.
Figure 1 depicts the modiﬁed CSMA protocol which is
used by the covert transmitter. The transmitter and the re-
ceiver are equipped with a virtual clock called covert clock.
The covert clock is incremented every time a packet from
members of the covert set is detected. Due to the broadcast
nature of the wireless channel, the transmitter and the re-
ceiver can observe the channel activities of the members of
the covert set and increment their clock synchronously. This
only requires that both sides track the same set of users and

are equipped with proper error correction methods in case a
mismatch happens between the transmitter and the receiver.
Each covert message (i.e., ω) is associated to a unique
state in the ﬁrst stage of the transmitter’s transmission win-
dow (i.e., stage 0). The covert communication begins as the
transmitter moves to the corresponding state of the covert
message. Then, the transmitter monitors the channel to
catch packets from members of the covert set. For each
packet, the transmitter’s clock is incremented by one unit
and it moves down one state in its transmission window (to
the left in Figure 1). The transmitter sends its next packet
when it reaches the last state of the transmission window.
The receiver also maintains its covert clock similar to the
transmitter. Hence, upon receiving a packet from the trans-
mitter, the receiver reads the value of its clock, decodes the
covert message, and resets the clock for the next message.
However, if the transmitter fails to transmit the packet on
the proper time slot (e.g., due to collision), it expands its
contention window and selects a new time slot that corre-
sponds to the covert message. Indeed, this window expan-
sion plays a critical role to maximize the stealthiness of the
covert transmitter as it mimics the behavior of an ordinary
CSMA node to handle collisions in the network. Thus,

Where, Ti is the size of the transmitter’s contention win-
dow in the ith stage, and M is the number of backoﬀ stages.
The parameter α, is a design parameter that controls how
far the transmitter deviates from behaviors of a regular user.
Finally, in order to keep synchronization between the trans-
mitter and the receiver, following each unsuccessful packet
transmission attempt, the transmitter waits for Ti − ω ex-
tra clock ticks (i.e., packets from members of the covert set)
before moving to the next stage. Hence, at the beginning of
the ith stage, the covert clocks at the receiver and the trans-
j=0 Tj , regardless of the covert
mitter would be equal to
message. The receiver removes this oﬀset from its covert
clock (i.e., Cr) and decodes the message as: ω = Cr mod T0.
3. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS RESULTS
The performance analysis is performed on four scenarios
(Table 1) using a CSMA testbed with Slot time = 20μs,
SIFS = 10μs, DIFS = 50μs, Payload = 1.5KB, and Channel
overt rate = 1M bps.

In order to evaluate the stealthiness of the channel, we
use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test) [5] and the reg-
Figure 2: Covert rate of the proposed channel.
Figure 3: Overt rate of the covert transmitter
ularity test [6]. The KS-test shows the diﬀerence between
the distributions of the inter-packet delays sampled from the
covert transmitter’s traﬃc and the traﬃc originated from a
regular node. The regularity test is designed to detect the
abnormal behavior of the covert transmitter in reacting to
the network events (e.g., packet loss). The test results in
Table 2 veriﬁes that the transmitter has similar long-term
characteristics (KS-test) and short-term behaviors (regular-
ity test) as compared to a regular CSMA node.
Figure 2 shows the achievable rate of the proposed covert
channel. It is noted that the covert channel rate increases
linearly with the capacity of the overt channel. The overt
communication rate of the covert transmitter and regular
users in the system are depicted in Figure 3. From the graph,
it can be observed that the transmitter conveys the same
overt rate as compared to regular users of the system. Thus,
it is extremely diﬃcult for a system observer to track the
transmitter based on overt communication rate.
