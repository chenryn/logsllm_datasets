# Steps to Reproduce
Make a class with a destructor.  
Make a celery task.  
Instantiate the class in the celery task.  
Make the celery task raise an Exception.  
See how destructor dosn't get called.(Gets called if task ends in success)

## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
    class WelcomeClass():
        def __init__(self):
            print("HELLOOOOO")
        def __del__(self):
            print("BYEEEEE")
    @app_cluster.task(bind=True, autoretry_for=(Exception,), max_retries=3,
                      default_retry_delay=10)
    def execute(self, param_a, param_b=None, **kwargs):
        print("started")
        jb = WelcomeClass()
        if param_b is None:
            param_b = "filled"
            print("retry")
            self.retry(exc=Exception("i have filled now"), args=[param_a, param_b], kwargs=kwargs)
        print("ended")
    def test_celery(self):
        sig = execute.si("something")
        t = sig.delay()
        t = 0
# Expected Behavior
I expect the destructor of a class begin called everytime a celery task
succeed/fail/raise exception etc
# Actual Behavior
Destrucutor gets called only when task succeed.
