### Peak Popularity and Download Patterns

To determine the peak popularity of each file, we calculate the midpoint of the week with the highest number of downloads. In cases of ties, we select the earlier week. Approximately 40% of the global dataset's downloads occur during the peak week, with 20% before and 40% after the peak week. Additionally, there is a significant tail of downloads both before and after the peak week.

**Figure 5** also presents the results for the university dataset, revealing a substantial difference in download timing. For instance, over 70% of the university dataset's downloads occur before the global peak week, with approximately 40% taking place at least 10 weeks before the global peak. This observation suggests that users at well-connected universities may be useful for predicting content that will become increasingly popular.

### General Observations and Category-Specific Trends

To assess the generality of this observation, **Figure 6** breaks down the percentage of downloads that occurred on or before the week of the global peak for each distinct file category. The fraction of early downloads is significantly higher in the university dataset across almost all categories, particularly for anime, games, and TV shows. In contrast, university users tend to be late adopters of music files. We hypothesize that the combination of high-speed internet access and tech-savvy users alters user behavior, thereby changing the workload. Early adopter groups provide good content-sharing opportunities, and peer storage could be prioritized based on the content types for which peers are early downloaders.

### Differences in Peak Weeks

Next, we consider the differences in the actual peak week as observed at the university and globally. **Figure 7** shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the relative difference in weeks. In addition to the CDF for all files, we also show three lines for the set of videos among the 10, 100, and 1,000 most popular files. These results confirm that university users are early downloaders, but they also indicate that the differences in peak times are most pronounced for the most popular files. This suggests that well-connected university users may be particularly early to download highly popular content. The significant number of early local peaks for the "all curve" indicates a substantial tail of niche content that university users download early, suggesting potential insights into future global popularity by observing content consumption trends on well-connected university networks.

### Global Peak Timing and Flash Crowd Behavior

While previous studies have observed early flash crowd behavior immediately after content release, our findings suggest that the global peak of popular content often occurs well after its release. **Figure 8** shows the average time (in weeks) until the global peak for content of different popularity, using logarithmic binning with four bins per scale factor of 10. This figure supports our hypothesis that popular content often peaks well after its release. Local results, while omitted for brevity, are consistent with this observation both locally and globally.

**Figure 9** displays the CDF of the time until the peak for the most popular files in the global dataset. Notably, more than 60% of the top 100 most popular files peak at least 20 weeks after their first observed downloads. For less popular files, there are more instances of early peaking, but a substantial number still peak several weeks after their initial discovery. This suggests that the popularity dynamics of these files are not determined by initial flash crowd behavior but rather build over time.

### Rich-Get-Richer Models and Hotset Churn

Preferential attachment and rich-get-richer models, applied to various domains, suggest that popular files gain even more downloads due to their existing popularity. **Figure 10** illustrates the number of downloads in week 27 of a video’s lifetime as a function of the number of downloads in week 26 and the total number of downloads up to and including week 26. The previous week's downloads are a strong predictor of the following week's downloads, with a slope close to one. The total number of downloads also shows a strong correlation, though the direct relationship is weaker.

In general, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between consecutive weeks (after log transformation) is 0.35 and 0.68 for the university and global datasets, respectively, with standard deviations of 0.12 and 0.15. These results suggest that rich-get-richer models may help describe BitTorrent popularity, and that a file’s popularity often peaks long after its release. This contrasts with previously proposed flash crowd models and aligns with recent observations by Zhang et al. [19].

### Hotset Churn Analysis

We next assess the weekly churn in content popularity, focusing on the "hotset," the set of most downloaded files in a given week. **Figure 11(a)** shows the overlap in the hotset observed in consecutive weeks at the university or global dataset and the fraction of files in the university hotset that are simultaneously in the global hotset. There is typically high churn in the hotset, with an average of only 20-40% weekly overlap. The overlap between the two datasets is even lower, with less than a 10% overlap.

Among the files that enter the hotset, 33.4% (19.2%) of the files at the university (globally) enter multiple times. While the majority of files (84.8% and 93.7%) remain in the hotset for only a single week, 1.6% (0.7%) remain for at least five weeks. The smaller percentage of long-term popular files in the global dataset is likely due to higher overall churn. As a fraction of the number of files in the hotset, the datasets appear more similar. **Figure 11(b)** illustrates this, showing a given week’s overlap with the hotset of week 20. In some weeks, the hotset is almost entirely replaced, and both datasets contain files that remain in the hotset for longer periods, with some files moving in and out multiple times.

### Conclusions

Using two simultaneously collected datasets, capturing download characteristics and content popularity dynamics at a university campus and globally, we analyzed the differences in workload dynamics observed locally versus globally. We found that users on a well-connected university network download larger files and are early adopters of new content, downloading files well before the global popularity peaks. These characteristics suggest design modifications to content replication systems like BitTorrent to localize the effects of "rich" users and improve the scalability of the global system. Exploring these alternative designs is left for future work.
