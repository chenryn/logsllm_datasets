to the time that each (individual) ﬁle’s popularity peaked globally. We calculate
the peak popularity of each ﬁle as the mid-point of the week that had the most
downloads. In the case of ties, we pick the earlier week. Approximately 40% of
the downloads in the global dataset happen during the peak week, 20% before
the peak week, and 40% after the peak week. Furthermore, there is a substantial
tail of downloads both before and after the peak week.
Figure 5 also shows the results for the university dataset. There is a substantial
diﬀerence in when the downloads take place on campus. For example, more than
70% of the downloads in the university dataset take place before the global peak
week. In fact, roughly 40% of the downloads takes place at least 10 weeks before
the global peak week. This is particularly interesting as it may suggest that
users at well-connected universities can be used for predicting content that will
become increasingly popular.
To assess the generality of this observation, Figure 6 breaks down the per-
centage of downloads that took place on or before the week that the global
popularity peaked for each distinct ﬁle in a particular category. The fraction of
early downloads is much higher in the university dataset for almost all categories,
particularly for anime, games, and TV shows. For music ﬁles, on the other hand,
the University users seem to be late to follow current trends. We hypothesize
that the combination of high speed Internet access and tech-savvy users alters
the user behavior, thereby changing the workload. We note user groups that are
early adopters of a content type provide good content-sharing opportunities for
that content, and that peer storage could be prioritized based on the content
types for which the peer have been found to be an early downloader.
We next consider the diﬀerence in the actual peak week, as observed at the
university and globally. Figure 7 shows the CDF of the relative diﬀerence in
weeks. In addition to the CDF for all ﬁles, we also show three lines for the set
of videos that are among the 10, 100, and 1,000 most popular ﬁles, as observed

globally. These results conﬁrm our earlier observation that the university users
are early downloaders; however, they also show that the diﬀerences in peak times
are biggest for the ﬁles that are the most popular (e.g., in the top 10 curve).
This suggests that well-connected university users may be particularly early to
download content that will become highly popular. The signiﬁcant number of
early local peaks for the “all curve”, suggests that there is also a substantial tail
of niche content that the University users are early to download. Thus, there may
be lessons to be learned about future (global) popularity, by observing content
consumption trends on (well-connected) university networks.
While previous studies have observed early ﬂash crowd behavior immediately
after the release of content [10], the fact that we observe big diﬀerences in the
peaks of popular content suggests that the global peak of popular content often
happens well after the release of the content. Figure 8 shows the average time
(in weeks) until the global peak for content of diﬀerent popularity, as a func-
tion of the number of downloads during the ﬁles’ peak week and over the full
measurement period, respectively. Here, we applied logarithmic binning, with
four bins per scale-factor 10. This ﬁgure supports our hypothesis that popular
content in fact often peaks well after its release (or in this case, conservatively,
after we ﬁrst discover it having been released). While local results are omitted
for brevity, this observation is consistent both locally and globally.
Figure 9 shows the CDF of the time until peak for the most popular ﬁles in
the global dataset. We note that the most popular ﬁles (top 100) peak well after
we ﬁrst discover them; e.g., more than 60% of these ﬁles peak at least 20 weeks
after we ﬁrst observe downloads. As suggested by the previous ﬁgure, for less
popular ﬁles there are more ﬁles that peak early. However, also for these ﬁles
there is a substantial amount of ﬁles that peak several weeks after ﬁrst observed.
The fact that most of the popular ﬁles peak rather late suggests that the
popularity dynamics of these ﬁles are not determined by any initial ﬂash crowd
behavior when the ﬁle is released [10], but that popular ﬁles instead often build
popularity over time. Preferential attachment and rich-get-richer models have
been applied to various domains, and suggest that ﬁles that have gained many
downloads typically gain even more downloads due to the fact that they are
popular. To validate if the global popularity in fact follows this characteristic,

Fig. 11. Hotset churn analysis
Figure 10 shows the number of downloads in week 27 of a video’s lifetime, as
a function of the number of downloads in week 26, and as a function of the
total number of downloads up to and including week 26. This corresponds to the
views at the half-year mark of the video’s lifetime. Again, we used logarithmic
binning (with four bins per scale factor 10). We note that the previous week’s
downloads (in week 26) on average is a very good predictor of the number of
downloads during the following week. In fact, the slope is very close to one.
Also, the total number of downloads (up until the current week) shows strong
correlation; however, the direct relationship is much weaker.
In general, ignoring the age of the videos, the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient
between consecutive weeks (after log transformation) is on average 0.35 and
0.68 (with standard deviations of 0.12 and 0.15) for the university and global
datasets, respectively.
To summarize, our results suggest that rich-get-richer models may help describe
the BitTorrent popularity, and that a (popular) ﬁle’s popularity often peaks long af-
ter it is released. This observation is in contrast to previously proposed ﬂash crowd
models that include a decreasing number of downloads per time unit following the
initial ﬂash crowd, but is similar to recent observations by Zhang et al. [19]. This
suggests that search mechanisms are not as eﬀective as they could be. The adoption
of other technologies (e.g., RSS feeds, online social networks) may also reduce the
delay between when content is released and when its popularity peaks.
6 Hotset Churn
We next assess the weekly churn in content popularity. For this analysis we focus
on the “hotset”, the set of most downloaded ﬁles in a given week. Figure 11(a)
shows the overlap in the hotset observed in consecutive weeks at the university
or global dataset, and the fraction of ﬁles in the university hotset that simulta-
neously are in the global hotset. While there are high variations, we note that
there typically is high churn in the hotset, with on average only 20-40% weekly
overlap. The overlap between the hotsets of the two datasets for any given week
is even lower, with less than a 10% overlap.
Global and Local Dynamics
261
Among the ﬁles that at some point are in the hotset, we found that 33.4%
(19.2%) of the ﬁles at the university (globally) enter the hotset multiple times.
While the majority of ﬁles (84.8% and 93.7%) only remain in the hotset for a
single week, 1.6% (0.7%) of the ﬁles remained in the hotset for at least ﬁve weeks.
We note that the smaller percentage of long-term popular ﬁles in the global
dataset is likely due to a higher overall churn (as indicated by more one-timers
and one-week cases). As a fraction of the number of ﬁles in the hotset, however,
the datasets appear much more similar. These observations are illustrated by
Figure 11(b), which shows a given week’s overlap with the hotset of week 20.
In a few weeks the hotset is almost entirely replaced, both datasets contain ﬁles
that remain in the hotset for a longer period, and some number of ﬁles (in both
datasets) appears to move in and out of the hotset multiple times.
7 Conclusions
Using two simultaneously collected datasets, capturing the download character-
istics and the content popularity dynamics observed both at a university campus
and by a large set of global BitTorrent trackers, this paper analyzed the diﬀer-
ences in workload dynamics observed locally versus at a global scale. We ﬁnd
that users on a well-connected university network download larger ﬁles and are
early adopters of new content; they download ﬁles well before the time at which
the global popularity of the ﬁles peaks. These characteristics suggest design mod-
iﬁcations to content replication systems such as BitTorrent, to localize the eﬀects
of “rich” users, and improve the scalability of the global system. Exploring these
alternative designs is left for future work.
