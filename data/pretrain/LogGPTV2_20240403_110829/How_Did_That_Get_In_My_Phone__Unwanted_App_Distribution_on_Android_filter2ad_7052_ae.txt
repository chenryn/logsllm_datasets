### Child Signers and Installer Markets

Each row in the table represents an installer, identified by a package name and signer pair. The first row corresponds to the Google Play Store (com.android.vending). This table excludes the previous package name for the official market (com.google.android.feedback) and Play APKs signed by other signers, such as the AOSP test key.

**Table VIII: Top 10 Markets by Number of Child Signers**

| Rank | Market Package Name | Children | IDR (%) | Signature Count |
|------|---------------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 1    | com.android.vending | 816K     | 0.6%    | 1.2M            |
| 7    | com.sec.android.app.samsungapps | 14K  | 1.2%   | 26K             |
| 8    | com.mobile.indiapp  | 12K      | 1.6%    | 15K             |
| 9    | com.amazon.venezia  | 12K      | 0.7%    | 23K             |
| 10   | com.oppo.market     | 10K      | 2.8%    | 12K             |
| 11   | com.xiaomi.mipicks  | 10K      | 1.1%    | 12K             |
| 12   | com.farsitel.bazaar | 8K       | 10.5%   | 20K             |
| 13   | ir.mservices.market | 8K       | 4.4%    | 13K             |
| 15   | com.vivo.appstore   | 7K       | 0.9%    | 9K              |
| 18   | com.huawei.appmarket| 7K       | 11.7%   | 9K              |

For each market, the table shows the rank by the number of child signers across all categories. Significant differences in IDR are observed among different markets. The Huawei market (com.huawei.appmarket) has the highest IDR at 11.7%, followed by the Iranian Bazaar market (com.farsitel.bazaar) with 10.5%, the Iranian MyKet market (ir.mservices.market) with 4.4%, the NearMe market from Chinese vendor Oppo (com.oppo.market) with 2.8%, and the 9Apps Indian market (com.mobile.indiapp) with 1.6% IDR. In contrast, the Google Play Store and Amazon's market have the lowest IDRs at 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. This suggests that the security vetting process applied by the Google Play Store effectively enhances user security. Users of alternative markets face up to 19 times higher probability of encountering unwanted apps compared to the Google Play Store.

### Browsers

**Table IX: Top 10 Browsers by Number of Child Signers**

| Rank | Browser Package Name | Browser Name | IDR (%) | Child Signatures |
|------|----------------------|--------------|---------|------------------|
| 42   | com.UCMobile.intl    | UC           | 3.8%    | 1,593            |
| 45   | com.android.chrome   | Chrome       | 3.9%    | 1,521            |
| 80   | com.opera.browser    | Opera        | 3.6%    | 536              |
| 142  | com.uc.browser.en    | UC Mini      | 5.0%    | 225              |
| 158  | org.mozilla.ﬁrefox   | Firefox      | 3.6%    | 193              |
| 164  | com.opera.mini.native | Opera Mini   | 10.5%   | 183              |
| 166  | com.brave.browser    | Brave        | 5.1%    | 175              |
| 173  | com.coloros.browser  | Oppo ColorOS | 4.0%    | 157              |
| 197  | com.android.browser  | Android (Oppo) | 8.8% | 133              |
| 215  | com.nearme.browser   | Oppo NearMe  | 6.7%    | 111              |

UC Browser and Chrome lead the list, ranking 42nd and 45th, respectively, among all installers. The top seven browsers are available in the Google Play Store, while the last three are preinstalled on Oppo devices. Significant differences in IDR are observed, with most browsers having an IDR between 3.8% and 5.1%. However, Opera Mini stands out with an IDR of 10.5%, which is more than double the IDR of the full Opera browser (3.6%). The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, as prior research does not indicate significant security differences between Opera versions.

### Privileged Installers

Privileged installers, those signed by a platform key, are responsible for 4.1% of all installs and 9% of unwanted installs. The high ratio of unwanted installs is concerning because these installers have system-level permissions and cannot be uninstalled by regular users or security tools, only by the superuser or through ADB. Security tools can only recommend disabling them. Most system-level installers come pre-installed, but 35% of their installs are for other system-level apps. The "Platform" column in Table VII shows the number of system-level installers per category, dominated by bloatware and backup (phone cloning) apps. More than half of the installers in these categories are privileged, aligning with user complaints about bloatware installing additional apps without the ability to uninstall them.

### Full Dataset Analysis

The analysis so far has been based on the Subset dataset, corresponding to 412 million install events for which parent information was recovered. Table XI in the Appendix presents the same results for the Full dataset of 1.7 billion install events. Although the Full dataset may misclassify some installs due to impersonation, it avoids any bias introduced in the Subset dataset. The results from both datasets are very similar, indicating no significant sampling bias in the Subset dataset.

### Summary

The Google Play Store is the primary app distribution vector, responsible for 87% of all installs and 67% of unwanted installs. Its VDR is 0.6%, indicating that its defenses against unwanted apps are effective, though a significant number still bypass these defenses. Alternative markets account for 5.7% of all installs and 10.4% of unwanted installs, with an average IDR of 3.2%, five times higher than the Google Play Store. Web downloads are rare (<0.1% of installs) but pose a significantly higher risk. Backup restoration and bloatware are also significant vectors for unwanted app distribution, responsible for 4.8% and 6% of unwanted installs, respectively.

### Pay-Per-Install (PPI)

PPI is a software distribution model where advertisers pay publishers to advertise and install programs on user devices. Publishers receive a commission for each confirmed install. PPI services can be divided into underground and commercial. Underground PPI services often distribute malware and use silent installs, while commercial PPI services are backed by companies and prompt users to decide about the install.

Android PPI services have not been extensively analyzed. We provide an initial look, starting with the known package names of three standalone installers for two commercial PPI services, IronSource (IS) and DigitalTurbine (DT), mentioned in prior work. Both partner with device vendors and carriers to pre-install their installers, which then offer apps to users. If the user installs an advertised app, the PPI service and the partner split the commission paid by the advertiser.

Starting from the known IS and DT PPI installers, we identified 48 IS and 38 DT installers by examining apps from the same signer and/or similar package names. These 86 installers were used to produce the PPI results in Table VII.

**Table VII: PPI Results**

| PPI Service | Total Installs | Unwanted Installs | IDR (%) |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| IronSource  | 36K            | 0.2%              | 0.3%    |
| DigitalTurbine | 644K          | 0.1%              | 1.1%    |

IronSource (IS) is an Israeli advertising company with 48 installers, including the names of 37 partners. The IDR for IS installers ranges from 0% to 5.6%, with a mean of 0.3% and a median of 0%. Popular apps installed via IS include Wish shopping, Booking, and Candy Crush Soda Saga.

DigitalTurbine (DT) is a public company headquartered in Austin, Texas, with 38 installers and 21 partners. The IDR for DT installers ranges from 0.0% to 9.7%, with a mean of 1.1% and a median of 0%. Popular apps installed via DT include Facebook, Slotomania, and Empire: Four Kingdoms.

### Top Unknown Installers

We examine installers for which it is unclear why they would need to install other apps, focusing on those that install apps from at least 10 signers. **Table X: Top 10 Unknown Installers by IDR**

| Rank | Package Name | Available in Play | Platform Key | INSTALL PACKAGES Permission | SDR (%) | IDR (%) | Child Packages | Child Signers | GPR (%) |
|------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|---------|---------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| 1    | cn.feelcool.superﬁles | No | No | Yes | 82.4% | 71.4% | 12 | 12 | 0% |
| 2    | com.google.android.play.ms72 | No | No | No | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| 3    | com.snaptube.premium | No | No | No | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| 4    | cn.opda.a.phonoalbumshoushou | No | No | No | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| 5    | launcher3.android.com.hivelauncher | No | No | No | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 | 0 | 0% |

The top unknown installer, `cn.feelcool.superﬁles`, is clearly an unwanted installer, with all its APKs considered unwanted and a very high SDR and IDR. None of the 12 apps it installs are available in the Google Play Store. AVClass labels its samples as adware from the hiddenads family. The rest of the installers are not unwanted but install a significant fraction of unwanted apps. None of these installers are available in the Google Play Store, and their installation paths are unclear, suggesting they may come pre-installed.
