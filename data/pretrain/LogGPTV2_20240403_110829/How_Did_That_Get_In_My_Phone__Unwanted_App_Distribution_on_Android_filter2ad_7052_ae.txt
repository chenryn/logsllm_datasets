test key. For each market, the table shows the rank by number
of child signers across all categories. We observe signiﬁcant
differences in IDR for different markets. The highest IDR
of 11.7% is for the Huawei market (com.huawei.appmarket),
followed by the Iranian Bazaar market (com.farsitel.bazaar)
with 10.5%, the Iranian MyKet market (ir.mservices.market)
with 4.4%, the NearMe market from Chinese vendor Oppo
(com.oppo.market) with 2.8%, and the 9Apps Indian market
(com.mobile.indiapp) with 1.6% IDR. On the better side of
the spectrum, there are the Play market and Amazon’s market
with the lowest IDRs of 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. This
indicates that the security vetting process that the Play market
applies to uploaded apps indeed has a positive effect on
user security [2]. Compared to the Play market, the users of
alternative markets have up to 19 times higher probability of
encountering unwanted apps.
Browsers. Table IX is similar for the top 10 browsers. UC
Browser tops the table followed closely by Chrome. These
two browsers rank 42 and 45, respectively, among all installers.
The top seven browsers are available in the Play market, while
the last three correspond to browsers preinstalled in Oppo
phones. Similar to the markets, we can observe signiﬁcant
differences in IDR between some mobile browsers. Most
browsers have an IDR in the range 3.8%–5.1%, but Opera Mini
has twice that risk (10.5% IDR), even more compared to the

Privileged installers. An orthogonal classiﬁcation is whether
installers are system or user level apps. System-level installers
signed by a platform key are responsible for 4.1% of all installs
and 9% of unwanted installs. The high ratio of unwanted
installs is especially worrying because these installers have
access to system level permissions and cannot be uninstalled
by normal users or security tools, only by the superuser or
through ADB. Security tools can only recommend the user to
disable them. Most system-level installers come pre-installed,
but we observe that 35% of their installs are for other system-
level apps. Thus, it is possible for other system-level installers
to be installed later in the device lifetime. Column Plat. in
Table VII shows the number of system-level installers per
category, which is dominated by bloatware and backup (i.e.,
phone cloning) apps. More than half of installers in those two
categories are privileged. This matches common complaints
by users that bloatware is installing apps in their phones and
cannot be uninstalled.
Considering all
So far, we have analyzed the
Subset dataset corresponding to the 412M install events for
which we could recover parent information. Table XI in the
Appendix presents the same results in Table VII, but for the
Full dataset of 1.7B install events. Results in Table XI could
misclassify some installs due to impersonation, but avoid any
bias introduced when selecting the Subset dataset. The results
on both datasets are very similar, indicating that no signiﬁcant
sampling bias was introduced in the Subset dataset.
Takeaway. To summarize, we observe that the Play market
is the main app distribution vector responsible for 87% of
all installs and 67% of unwanted installs. However, its VDR
is only 0.6%, showing that the Play market defenses against
unwanted apps work, but still signiﬁcant amounts of unwanted
apps are able to bypass them, making it the main distribution
vector for unwanted apps. Among the remaining installs,
alternative markets are the largest, being responsible for 5.7%
of all installs and 10.4% of unwanted installs. Furthermore,
on average they are ﬁve times riskier (3.2% VDR) than
the Play market (0.6%). App downloads from the Web are
installs.
rare (<0.1% installs), but have a signiﬁcantly higher risk.
Backup restoration is an unintended unwanted app distribution
vector responsible for 4.8% of unwanted installs. Bloatware is
another surprisingly high distribution vector, responsible for
6% of unwanted installs.
B. Pay-Per-Install
Pay-per-install (PPI) is a software distribution model where
an advertiser pays publishers to advertise a program and have
it installed on user devices. Publishers are paid a commission
for each conﬁrmed install on a new device. The advertiser
can reach direct agreements with publishers, e.g., setting up
an afﬁliate network, or can leverage PPI services, who act as
middle-men between advertisers and publishers.
Previous work analyzed Windows PPI services, dividing
them into underground and commercial [23], [45], [73]. Un-
derground PPI services mostly distribute malware, do not
advertise themselves publicly, and often use silent installs, i.e.,
the user is unaware of the installation [23]. Commercial PPI
services, instead, are backed by companies and prompt offers
for users to decide about the install [45], [73]. In both types,
publishers are paid for each install of a PPI installer program
that then downloads the currently advertised programs.
As far as we know, Android PPI services have not yet been
analyzed, so we provide a ﬁrst look at them. Advertising in
Android often uses ad libraries that ad networks ask publishers
to include into their apps. For PPI services, if the publishers
are owners of popular apps, the service may provide them
with a library to include in their apps. On the other hand, if
the publishers are device vendors or carriers, the PPI service
provides them with a stand-alone installer to be pre-installed
in their branded devices. As a starting point, we knew the
package names of three stand-alone installers for two Android
commercial PPI services, IronSource (IS) and DigitalTurbine
(DT), mentioned in prior work [33]. Both commercial PPI
services partner with device vendors and carriers to pre-install
their installer, which can then offer apps to the user. If the user
installs an advertised app, PPI and partner (carrier or vendor)
split the commission paid by the advertiser. In addition, we
had a list of 59 apps identiﬁed in prior work [61] that pay
their users a commission if they install other apps. In this
PPI model, there is no publisher and the PPI service directly
interacts with users. While these 59 apps appear in a handful
of devices in the reputation logs, they did not perform any
installs in our dataset. Starting from the known IS and DT PPI
installers, we leveraged the 34.6M APKs in the reputation logs
to identify further installers for those two services. For this, we
examined apps from the same signer and/or similar package
name. This process identiﬁed 48 IS and 38 DT installers. The
identiﬁed 86 installers were used to produce the PPI results in
Table VII.
The PPI row in Table VII shows that those two commercial
PPI services are responsible for 0.2% of all installs and 0.1%
of unwanted installs with DT being responsible for 644K
installs and IS for 36K. Thus, DT is the larger PPI. Obviously,
this is a very conservative lower bound on commercial PPI
distribution as more Android commercial PPI services likely
exist. However, we have not been able to identify more stand-
alone commercial PPI installers in our dataset. It may happen
that DT and IS dominate the agreements with carriers and
vendors. Thus, other commercial PPI services provide their
publishers with a library to embed into their apps, rather
than a stand-alone installer. Those PPI publishers should
then appear under the Other and Unclassiﬁed categories in
Table VII. Thus, we can conservatively estimate that all PPI
activity (commercial and underground) can be responsible
between 0.1% and 4% of all unwanted app installs. Of course,
assuming all uncategorized installers are involved in PPI is a
conservative upper bound as well. But, that upper bound is
already signiﬁcantly lower than the estimate that Windows PPI
services distributed over a quarter of all PUP [45]. Next, we
detail these two commercial PPIs. Then, in Section VI-C we
examine the unknown installers that may be involved in PPI
distribution.
IronSource. IS is an Israeli advertising company [41]. Its
offering includes the Aura out-of-the-box experience (OOBE)
platform, which they claim is installed in 130M devices [42].
The 48 IS installers include the name of vendor and carrier
partners in the package name (e.g., com.aura.oobe.samsung).
We observe 37 partners: 29 vendors (e.g., alcatel, huawei, htc,
samsung, xiaomi, zte), 7 carriers (e.g., digicel, hutchinson,
telus), and one OS publisher (remix). Of those, 8 vendors
(dewav, huawei, irulu, lge, longcheer, tinno, yulong) and the
OS publisher (remix) sign the IS installer with their platform
keys, which gives it system privilege. The IDR for IS installers
ranges 0%–5.6%, with a mean of 0.3% and a median of
0%. Thus, IS installs very few unwanted apps. In contrast,
their Windows PPI service had a 81% IDR [45]. The most
popular child apps are: Wish shopping, Booking, and Candy
Crush Soda Saga. We also observe TikTok, Netﬂix, Outlook,
SnapChat, Pinterest, Twitter, Skype, and Spotify. This shows
that some of the most popular apps leverage IronSource to
increase their user base. To conclude, we observe that IS has
signiﬁcantly cleaned their practices. Their vetting limits abu-
sive advertisers, achieving a IDR lower than other distribution
vectors such as markets and browsers. And, while they use
many certiﬁcates and package names, those are clearly labeled
as belonging to IronSource.
Digital Turbine. DT is a public company headquartered in
Austin, Texas. According to their 2019 ﬁscal year state-
ment [11] it works with 30 carriers and OEM vendors, is
installed in 260M devices, and has delivered one billion app
installs. Their revenue for 2019 totaled $103.6M. Similar to IS,
the 38 installers include the partner name (e.g., com.dti.att).
We observe 21 partners: 9 carriers (e.g., att, cricket, comcast,
uscc), 18 vendors (e.g., blu, lenovo, samsung, zte), and two
others (sliide, smartapp). The IDR for the installers ranges
0.0%–9.7% with a mean of 1.1% and a median of 0%. This is
worse than IS, but still low compared with other sources. The
most downloaded apps are popular: Facebook, Slotomania, and
Empire: Four Kingdoms. We also observe Instagram, Yelp,
and YahooMail. The advertised apps are mostly disjoint from
those IS advertises, but we found a few advertised through
both PPIs, e.g., Wish Shopping and Candy Crush Saga. While
the advertised apps are predominantly benign, com.dti.gionee
(9.7% IDR) is a clear exception, distributing apps from two
advertisers in Table V (VideoBuddy and MrOwl). Gionee
mostly sells its devices in India, thus both apps likely target
Indian users. We also found user reports that the installer name
displayed in the device was changed from DT Ignite to Mobile
Services Manager, with users complaining that this was done
for obfuscation [4]. Thus, while their overall IDR is not bad,
DT can still improve its transparency and advertiser vetting.
Takeaway. We provide a very conservative lower bound on
commercial PPI service distribution of 0.2% of all installs
and 0.1% of unwanted installs and observe that such services
seem to have improved their ﬁltering of abusive advertisers
compared to their Windows counterparts. We also estimate
that all PPI activity may be responsible for up to 4% of the
unwanted app installs. That upper bound is still signiﬁcantly
lower than the estimate of Windows commercial PPI services
being responsible for over a quarter of PUP installs [45].
C. Top Unknown Installers
In this Section we take a look at the installers for which
it is not clear based on their public description why they
would need to install other apps, other than for pay-per-install
advertising. These correspond to three rows in Table VII, the
installers that our classiﬁcation labels as Bloatware and Other,
as well as those left Unclassiﬁed. To make sure we analyze
relevant
installers, we focus on installers that install apps
from at least 10 signers. Table X shows the top 10 installers
satisfying those constraints, sorted by decreasing IDR. The
top two installers are Unclassiﬁed, ﬁve are Bloatware (ranks
5–9), and three are Other, two video downloaders (Snaptube,
Videoder) and one optimizer (Baidu Mobile Guard).
The top unknown installer is cn.feelcool.superﬁles. It is
clearly an unwanted installer since all its APKs known to VT
are considered unwanted (i.e., VT ≥ 4); its signing key has a
very high SDR (82.4%), i.e., its signer mostly signs unwanted
apps; and it has a very high IDR (71.4%), i.e., it mostly installs
unwanted apps. Furthermore, none of the 12 apps it installs
are available in the Play market. AVClass labels its samples as
adware from the hiddenads family. We believe we are the ﬁrst
to cast light on this unwanted installer. The rest of the installers
are not unwanted (e.g., low SDR), but install a signiﬁcant
fraction of unwanted apps.
None of these installers are available in the Play market,
so we examine how they arrived in the phone. We have no
installation events for the top two Unclassiﬁed installers, Thus,
they might come pre-installed, similar to the ﬁve bloatware
TABLE X: Candidate installers related to PPI identiﬁed. For each installer, it shows whether available in Play (GP), whether
signed by a platform key (Plt.), whether some APKs have the system-level INSTALL PACKAGES permission (IP), SDR, IDR,
number of children packages and signers, and the percentage of child packages in Play (GPR).
