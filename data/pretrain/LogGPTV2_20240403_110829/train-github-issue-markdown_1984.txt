### Expected Behavior
I was trying to write unit tests for my flask restful api which uses
BasicHttpAuth on the initial request and returns a JWT token. All subsequent
requests have this token in an x-access-header up to an expiry of 15 mins,
then re-authentication happens( the code for this is in the anacropapi repo on
my profile under api. **init**.py). I have noted the error in the template. I
thought this test client would be fully compatible with the requests package.
Does anyone know of a work around for this or can an auth keyword arg be added
?
    import unittest 
    class ApiTest(unittest.TestCase): 
        def setUp(self):
            # creates a test client
            self.app = app.test_client()
            # add a user into the account code goes here ...
        def tearDown(self):
            db.drop_all()
            # etc...
        def test_login(self):
            # sends HTTP GET request to the application
            # on the specified path with an auth kwarg passed like in requests 
             result = self.app.get('/login', auth=requests.auth.BasicHttpAuth(username, password)) 
### Actual Behavior
    this returns no auth arg found error i cant remember the specfic error off hand
