User: If I build a package with python setup.py bdist_wheel, the resulting package expands the shebangs in the scripts listed in setup.py via setup(scripts=["script/path"]) to use the absolute path to my python executable #!/home/f483/dev/storj/storjnode/env/bin/python.
This is obviously a problem as anyone using the wheel will not have that setup. It does not seem to make a difference what kind of shebang I am using.
Assistant: Using the generic shebang #!python seems to solve this problem.
Edit: This is incorect!
