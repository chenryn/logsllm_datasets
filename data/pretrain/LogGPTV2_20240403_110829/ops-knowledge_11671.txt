Question: "In the context of a device's sensor data protection, which of the following strategies is likely to be the least effective in preventing untrusted software from manipulating sensor output and why?"
 "A": "Using cryptographic techniques to sign and verify parametric data values."
 "B": "Implementing role-based access control to restrict which user roles can modify sensor parametric data."
 "C": "Relying on physical tamper-proofing of the device to prevent unauthorized access to hardware."
 "D": "Allowing unrestricted access to sensor calibration data with the expectation that system monitoring tools will detect and prevent misuse."
Answer: D
