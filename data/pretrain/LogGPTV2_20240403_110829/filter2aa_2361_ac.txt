case is the right to copy.  The Court agrees.  See Dkt. #82.  MDY and Donnelly argue that
Warden does not prevent, restrict, or otherwise limit a user’s ability to copy the literal code

3The Court is aware that Warden does not prevent all WoW users from copying the
dynamic nonliteral elements of the game.  Players who do not use Glider may copy that
content while connected to Blizzard servers.  The statute, however, requires only that the
technological measure “restricts[] or otherwise limits” unauthorized copying.  17 U.S.C. §
1201(b)(1)(A).

contained in the game client software or the individual nonliteral illustrations of that code
because both can be freely copied from the user’s hard drive.  The Court again agrees.  The
same cannot be said, however, with respect to the dynamic nonliteral elements of the game.
As explained above, these aspects of WoW can be accessed only while playing the game on
Blizzard’s servers.  By preventing or interrupting a Glider user’s access to the servers,
Warden effectively prevents that user from copying – should he choose to do so – the
dynamic nonliteral sights and sounds of WoW as it is being played.3
The Court concludes that MDY has violated section 1201(b)(1).  Warden constitutes
a “technological measure” within the meaning of section 1201(b)(1) to the extent it prevents
a user from copying the dynamic nonliteral elements of WoW as it is being played.  Glider
circumvents Warden within the meaning of the statute.  See 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(2)(A).  And
Glider is knowingly marketed by MDY for use in circumventing Warden.  See 17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(b)(1)(C). 
III.
The Personal Liability of Michael Donnelly.
Blizzard contends that Michael Donnelly should be held personally liable for the
tortious interference, contributory copyright infringement, vicarious copyright infringement,
and DMCA violations.  The Court will set forth relevant facts and then address the law.
A.
Findings of Fact.
Michael Donnelly is the president of MDY and manages its day-to-day operations.
MDY is the entity that promotes and modifies Glider.  MDY currently has two employees.
These employees work under the direction of Donnelly.
Donnelly did not believe that the creation or distribution of Glider violated the
copyright laws.  Donnelly did not copy any of Blizzard’s code, nor does Glider seek to
replicate the WoW game.  Donnelly knew that Glider users would be required to pay all

required WoW fees.
When Donnelly first introduced Glider, he read the Blizzard End User License
Agreement (“EULA”) and Terms of Use Agreement (“TOU”).  These contracts did not at the
time expressly prohibit bots.  They did prohibit cheats and hacks, but Donnelly did not view
Glider as a cheat or a hack because it did not modify any WoW code.  By November of 2005,
however, Donnelly understood that the use of Glider by his customers was a breach of their
contracts with Blizzard.  An e-mail written by Donnelly at the time stated that “[s]ince
Blizzard does not want bots running at all, it’s a violation to use them.”  Dkt. #43-10 at 3.
MDY’s website openly acknowledges that Glider “is against the [TOU] as provided by
Blizzard for [WoW].”  Dkt. #43-9 at 3.
In August of 2006, Donnelly received a cease and desist letter from Blizzard.  The
letter addressed five files on MDY’s website and claimed that they contained Blizzard
intellectual property.  Four of the five files consisted of screen shots from WoW.  Donnelly
removed those files from his website.  The fifth file concerned the “launchpad” program that
Donnelly had written for Glider.  Because Donnelly did not understand how this program
affected Blizzard’s copyright, he wrote Blizzard and asked for an explanation.  Blizzard did
not respond.
In October of 2006, representatives of Blizzard appeared at Donnelly’s home.  They
informed him that Glider violated Blizzard’s copyrights and demanded that he immediately
cease selling Glider and disgorge all profits earned from Glider.  The representatives
threatened to file a lawsuit in California the next day if Donnelly refused to comply.
Donnelly immediately sought legal counsel.  When that counsel was unable to obtain an
extension of Blizzard’s deadline, Donnelly brought this action in Arizona before Blizzard
could bring the action in California.  Donnelly has continued selling Glider during the course
of this lawsuit, including after the Court’s July 2008 ruling that the sale of Glider constituted
contributory and vicarious copyright infringement.  Dkt. #82.  Donnelly testified at trial that
he did not stop selling Glider after the Court’s ruling because he disagrees with the ruling and
believes it will be overturned on appeal.

Blizzard has suffered damages as a result of Glider.  Mr. Ashe testified without
contradiction that Glider and other bots diminish the game playing experience of WoW and
provoked 500,000 complaints to Blizzard between December of 2004 and March of 2008.
Blizzard spends almost $1,000,000 per year attempting to detect and eliminate Glider and
other bots, money that could be devoted to more productive uses.  Blizzard also believes that
it has lost customers and sales as a result of Glider, but has no way of determining how
many. 
B.
Conclusions of Law.
1.
Tortious Interference.
The parties agree that Arizona law applies to Blizzard’s tortious interference claim.
Under Arizona law, corporate officers and directors “are not personally liable for torts
committed by the corporation or by one of its officers merely by virtue of the office
they hold.”  Bischofshausen, Vasbinder, & Luckie v. D.W. Jaquays Mining & Equip.
Contractors Co., 700 P.2d 902, 908 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1985).  To be personally liable,
“the directors or officers must participate or have knowledge amounting to acquiescence or
be guilty of negligence in the management or supervision of the corporate affairs causing or
contributing to the injury.”  Id. at 908-09; see Albers v. Edelson Tech. Partners L.P., 31 P.3d
821, 826 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2001) (“[W]hile corporate officers and directors are generally
shielded from liability for acts done in good faith on behalf of the corporation, their status
does not shield them from personal liability to those harmed as a result of intentionally
harmful or fraudulent conduct.”); Dawson v. Withycombe, 163 P.3d 1034, 1051 (Ariz. Ct.
App. 2007) (“Under Arizona law, a director cannot be liable without some kind of personal
participation in the tort or at least acquiescence by knowledge of the tort combined with a
failure to act.”).
To establish MDY’s liability for tortious interference, Blizzard was required to prove
that (1) a valid contractual relationship existed between Blizzard and its customers, (2) MDY
knew of the relationship, (3) MDY intentionally and improperly interfered in the relationship
and caused a breach or termination of the relationship, and (4) Blizzard was damaged as a

4 Citing Bar J Bar Cattle Co. v. Pace, 763 P.2d 545 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1988), MDY
contended in its summary judgment briefing that “[m]alice must be the sole motivator for the
actor to interfere tortiously.”  Dkt. ##45 at 22, 57 at 26 (emphasis in original).  The Court
disagreed.  Dkt. #82 at 25 n. 12.  Bar J Bar simply recognizes that the impropriety of a
defendant’s conduct requires a multi-pronged inquiry. Malice is one “facet[] of the element

result.  See Antwerp Diamond Exch. of Am., Inc. v. Better Bus. Bur. of Maricopa County,
Inc., 637 P.2d 733, 740 (Ariz. 1981); Wagenseller v. Scottsdale Mem’l Hosp., 710 P.2d 1025,
1043 (Ariz. 1985) (en banc), superseded in other respects by A.R.S. § 23-1501.  The Court
found that each of these elements has been satisfied.  See Dkt. #82 at 22-26.
For Donnelly to be personally liable for MDY’s tortious interference, the Court
concludes that Donnelly must have known that MDY was engaging in tortious interference.
Donnelly does not dispute that a valid contractual relationship existed between Blizzard and
its customers.  Donnelly clearly knew of the relationship – he read the contracts.  Since at
least November 2005, Donnelly knew that MDY was intentionally interfering with that
contractual relationship by inducing its customers to breach the TOU.  And, as the finding
of fact set forth above demonstrate, Blizzard has been damaged by Glider.  
The one remaining question is whether Donnelly knew MDY’s interference with
Blizzard’s contracts was improper.  The Court previously found that MDY’s actions were
improper under the seven-factor test of Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767.  Dkt. #82 at
23-26.  The Court finds that Donnelly, from at least November of 2005, was aware of the
facts that satisfy the seven-factor test and therefore knew that MDY’s conduct was improper.
Donnelly knew that Blizzard has established valid and financially profitable contracts with
its customers.  Donnelly knew that MDY aids WoW players in breaching their contracts with
Blizzard, assists the players in gaining an advantage over other WoW players, enables
players to mine the game for their own financial benefit and in violation of the TOU, assists
players in avoiding detection by Blizzard, and does so in a way designed to place Blizzard
at risk.  Donnelly knew that MDY’s motive was financial gain.  Donnelly knew that Glider
was successful because WoW was successful, and that MDY sought to exploit WoW’s
success for its own financial benefit.4

of impropriety that the plaintiff may show in a particular case.”  Wagenseller, 710 P.2d at
1043 (emphasis added).  Malice need not be shown if the other elements of improper conduct
exist.
- 16 -
Because Donnelly knew the facts that satisfy all seven factors enumerated in
Restatement § 767, the Court concludes that he knew that MDY was improperly interfering
with Blizzard’s customer contacts.  This is true whether or not he understood the details of
Arizona tortious interference law.  The Court therefore holds that Donnelly is personally
liable for MDY’s tortious interference from November 2005 forward.  The parties have
addressed damages through stipulation and have not asked the Court to determine the dollar
amount of this liability.
2.
Copyright Infringement and DMCA Violations.
“Courts within virtually every circuit have adopted a two-prong test to determine
whether a corporate officer is jointly and severally liable with the corporation for copyright
infringement.  The prerequisites for vicarious liability are:  (1) the officer has the right and
ability to supervise the infringing activity, and (2) the officer has a direct financial interest
in such activities.”  Jobete Music Co. v. Johnson Communications, Inc., 285 F. Supp. 2d
1077, 1083 (S.D. Ohio 2003) (citing cases); see Microsoft Corp. v. Ion Techs. Corp., 484 F.
Supp. 2d 955, 961 (D. Minn. 2007); BMI v. Rooster’s, Inc., No. Civ.A. 04-140-DLB, 2006
WL 335583, at *3 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 14, 2006); Coogan v. Avnet, Inc., No. CV-04-0621-PHX-
SRB, 2005 WL 2789311, at *7 (D. Ariz. Oct. 24, 2005); see also A&M Records, Inc. v.
Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1022 (9th Cir. 2001) (noting that vicarious liability for
copyright infringement “is an ‘outgrowth’ of respondeat superior”).
Donnelly does not address the issue of personal liability in his proposed findings of
facts and conclusions of law.  See Dkt. #88.  At oral argument, Donnelly relied on Murphy
Tugboat Co. v. Shipowners & Merchants Towboat Co., 467 F. Supp. 841 (N.D. Cal. 1979),
for the proposition that personal liability should be limited to cases where the defendant
engaged in “inherently wrongful conduct.”  See id. at 853.  Murphy involved the application
of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  Personal liability was limited because “‘the behavior

84 F.3d 1408, 1411 (Fed. Cir. 1996), for the proposition that officers are personally liable for
a corporation’s patent infringement only if they act culpably.  Donnelly has provided no case
applying this rule to copyright law.
