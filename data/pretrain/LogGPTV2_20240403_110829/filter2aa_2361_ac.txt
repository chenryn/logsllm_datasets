### Case Analysis: The Right to Copy

**Court Agreement and Reference**
The Court agrees with the assertion that the case pertains to the right to copy. See Dkt. #82. MDY and Donnelly argue that Warden, a software tool, does not prevent, restrict, or otherwise limit a user’s ability to copy the literal code contained in the game client software or the individual nonliteral illustrations of that code, as both can be freely copied from the user’s hard drive. The Court concurs with this argument.

**Warden and Dynamic Nonliteral Elements**
However, the Court notes that Warden does not prevent all World of Warcraft (WoW) users from copying the dynamic nonliteral elements of the game. Players who do not use Glider, a third-party bot, may copy that content while connected to Blizzard servers. The statute, 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1)(A), requires only that the technological measure “restricts[] or otherwise limits” unauthorized copying.

**Dynamic Nonliteral Elements and Server Access**
As explained, the dynamic nonliteral elements of WoW, such as sights and sounds, can be accessed only while playing the game on Blizzard’s servers. By preventing or interrupting a Glider user’s access to the servers, Warden effectively prevents that user from copying these dynamic nonliteral elements as they are being played.

**Conclusion on Section 1201(b)(1) Violation**
The Court concludes that MDY has violated section 1201(b)(1). Warden is deemed a “technological measure” within the meaning of section 1201(b)(1) to the extent it prevents a user from copying the dynamic nonliteral elements of WoW as it is being played. Glider circumvents Warden within the meaning of the statute, and MDY knowingly markets Glider for use in circumventing Warden. See 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(2)(A) and 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1)(C).

### Personal Liability of Michael Donnelly

**Blizzard's Claims**
Blizzard contends that Michael Donnelly should be held personally liable for tortious interference, contributory copyright infringement, vicarious copyright infringement, and Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) violations. The Court will set forth relevant facts and then address the applicable law.

**Findings of Fact**

- **Donnelly's Role and Knowledge**: Michael Donnelly is the president of MDY and manages its day-to-day operations. MDY promotes and modifies Glider, and currently has two employees working under Donnelly’s direction.
- **Initial Beliefs and Actions**: Donnelly did not believe that the creation or distribution of Glider violated copyright laws. He did not copy any of Blizzard’s code, nor does Glider seek to replicate the WoW game. Donnelly knew that Glider users would need to pay all required WoW fees.
- **EULA and TOU Review**: When Donnelly first introduced Glider, he read the Blizzard End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms of Use Agreement (TOU). These agreements did not explicitly prohibit bots at the time but did prohibit cheats and hacks. By November 2005, Donnelly understood that using Glider was a breach of contract for his customers.
- **Cease and Desist Letter**: In August 2006, Donnelly received a cease and desist letter from Blizzard, addressing five files on MDY’s website. Donnelly removed four files containing WoW screenshots but sought clarification on the fifth file, which concerned the launchpad program. Blizzard did not respond.
- **Blizzard's Demand**: In October 2006, Blizzard representatives visited Donnelly’s home, demanding he cease selling Glider and disgorge profits. Donnelly sought legal counsel and filed a lawsuit in Arizona before Blizzard could file in California. Donnelly continued selling Glider even after the Court’s July 2008 ruling.
- **Damages to Blizzard**: Blizzard suffered damages due to Glider, including diminished game experience, 500,000 complaints, and significant costs in detecting and eliminating bots.

**Conclusions of Law**

1. **Tortious Interference**
   - **Arizona Law**: Under Arizona law, corporate officers and directors are not personally liable for torts committed by the corporation unless they participate, have knowledge amounting to acquiescence, or are negligent in management.
   - **Elements of Tortious Interference**: To establish liability, Blizzard needed to prove a valid contractual relationship, MDY’s knowledge of the relationship, intentional and improper interference causing a breach, and resulting damages.
   - **Donnelly's Knowledge and Intent**: Donnelly knew of the valid contracts, intentionally interfered by inducing breaches, and caused damages. The Court found that Donnelly knew the facts satisfying the seven-factor test of impropriety under Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767, making him personally liable for tortious interference from November 2005 onward.

2. **Copyright Infringement and DMCA Violations**
   - **Vicarious Liability**: Courts generally apply a two-prong test for vicarious liability: (1) the officer has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity, and (2) the officer has a direct financial interest in such activities.
   - **Donnelly's Arguments**: Donnelly relied on Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Shipowners & Merchants Towboat Co., 467 F. Supp. 841 (N.D. Cal. 1979), for limiting personal liability to inherently wrongful conduct. However, this case involved antitrust law, and no similar limitation applies to copyright law.
   - **Personal Liability**: Given Donnelly’s role, knowledge, and financial interest, the Court holds him personally liable for MDY’s copyright infringement and DMCA violations.

This analysis provides a clear and structured overview of the Court's reasoning and conclusions regarding the right to copy, the role of Warden, and the personal liability of Michael Donnelly.
