ABSTRACT
Many security protocols used for daily Internet traffic have been
used for decades and standardization bodies like the IETF often
provide extensions for legacy protocols to deal with new require-
ments. Even though the security aspects for extensions are carefully
discussed, automated reasoning has proven to be a valuable tool to
uncover security holes that would otherwise have gone unnoticed.
Therefore, Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is already a customary
procedure for the development of some new protocols, e.g., TLS 1.3
and MLS.
IKEv2, the key exchange for the IPsec protocol suite, is expected
to undergo significant changes to facilitate the integration of Post-
Quantum Cryptography. We present the first formal security model
for the IKEv2-handshake in a quantum setting together with an au-
tomated proof using the Tamarin Prover. Our model focuses on the
core state machine, is therefore easily extendable, and aims to pro-
mote the use of ATP in IPsec-standardization. The security model
captures gaps in the protocol, but treats the specific implementation
(like fragmentation mechanisms, for example) as a black box. With
IKE_INTERMEDIATE we showcase this approach on a recently
proposed extension that significantly changes the protocol’s state
machine.

1 INTRODUCTION
IPsec is the most popular technology for providing Virtual Private
Networks (VPNs) and plays a central role for securing IP-based
communication. If an IPsec connection is established correctly, the
communication is then a) encrypted and thus unreadable for an
attacker listening on the wire (confidential), b) transmitted such
that modifications by an attacker are detected (integrity-protected),
and c) guaranteed to originate from the expected communication
partner (authentic). Often, further security properties apply. They
are usually accomplished by the use of cryptographic schemes.
Although IPsec itself uses symmetric cryptography to secure the
data transfer, unacquainted parties need a key exchange protocol
using asymmetric cryptography to agree on a shared secret, which is
then used as the key in the symmetric scheme. Although several key
agreement protocols exist, nowadays only Internet Key Exchange
version 2 (IKEv2) is of practical relevance for IPsec. In this work
we therefore focus on IKEv2 only.
The requirements for the whole protocol suite will change over
time due to new developments in the field of networking and other
new challenges. One of the motivations for future adaptions and
extensions is new progress in the field of cryptography. Due to
the increasing power of supercomputers, parameter sets for the
cryptographic primitives employed might exceed the limits of the
protocol within the coming years. Moreover, quantum computers

are on the rise and may pose a threat to conventional cryptography.
If they reach a certain size, they will be able to break the (Elliptic
Curve) Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which is essential to IKEv2.
Therefore, alternative or additional quantum-safe key exchanges
might be necessary. Furthermore, future governmental requisites
for the use of cryptographic schemes might lead to the necessity of
using multiple schemes in parallel.
In short, changes to the protocols are unavoidable to securely face
future threats and demands; at the same time they are sometimes
difficult to apply. The overall security level of the protocol (suite)
must not decrease by introducing modifications; a proper discussion
about this should be accompanied with (automated) proofs.
Contribution
We model the security of a minimal subset of IKEv2 in a quantum
setting (which is when an active attacker has access to a quantum
computer) and prove that in such a setting, IKEv2 is no longer secure.
We also analyze a proposed extension of the protocol which allows
the classic Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange to be supplemented
by multiple (quantum-resistant) key exchanges [33, 35]. We are
able to show that IKEv2 regains all desired security properties with
this extension.
Our analysis allows the comparison of IKEv2 with TLS 1.3 [32]
and Noise key agreement [36], which were also analyzed with
Tamarin [9, 17]. It also shows that IKEv2 - at least in its minimal
form - is designed so well that the extension for making it quantum-
safe is both straightforward and secure.
As a by-product, we provide a Tamarin-based IKEv2-verification
in the classical setting, which we use to ensure that our model agrees
with the proofs in the literature regarding security in the classical
case. The code is provided in Appendix A; it is open source2 and may
be used to further verify current and future protocol extensions.
A challenging aspect of the analysis is the resource-intensity:
Even the correct model takes up to a half hour to compute in our
environment; spotting errors is therefore laborious, and it may be
difficult to spot that a model check does not terminate at all. We
therefore point out that part of the contribution lies in executing
the analysis.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 IPsec and IKEv2
IPsec is a protocol suite which describes how different security
services can be used together to secure traffic in an IP-based com-
munication system. Its architecture is standardized by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 4301 [24], which distinguishes
between three concepts:
Security Protocol: These are the protocols used to secure the ac-
tual Internet Protocol traffic. Currently,
Authentication Header (AH) (RFC 4302 [22]) and
Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) (RFC 4303 [23]) are de-
fined, of which ESP is more commonly used. ESP achieves
confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the communi-
cation.
2An extended version of this paper can be found here [19], all code is available here:
https://github.com/mnm-team/tamarin-ikev2
Security Association (SA): Security Associations (SAs) are fun-
damental to IPsec. Each SA defines the provided security
service for a certain simplex connection between two com-
munication peers. Importantly, it describes how the desired
security goals are achieved. This includes specifying the
cryptographic algorithms and keys, various session informa-
tion, and the policies indicating which Security Protocol is
used to secure which kind of traffic.
Key Management: The Security Protocols rely on cryptographic
keys. These can be exchanged manually, but there are also
protocols to establish all parameters for an SA between un-
acquainted communication peers, which allows for more
flexibility. As stated in the introduction, we focus on Inter-
net Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) as defined in RFC 7296
[20] and refer to IKEv1 only when necessary.
The IKEv2 protocol implements an authenticated DH key exchange
with a minimum of two round-trips. In the first, the peers exchange
public DH-values to establish a confidential channel between them-
selves. The second round-trip authenticates the first exchange with
digital signatures or pre-shared keys. The two security protocols
(ESP and AH) are designed minimalistically; the key exchange
mechanism solves the most complex part of the IPsec suite. Thus,
most of the currently discussed extensions of IPsec concern IKEv2.
The standardization body responsible for IPsec has never re-
quired a formal security analysis for any modifications the protocol
underwent; most changes might have been regarded as too minor
to prompt such effort.
However, the recently proposed drafts for integrating post-quan-
tum key exchange to IKEv2 [33, 35] would structurally change the
protocol: First, it introduces several additional round-trips in the
protocol, which changes the state machine. Second, the derivation
function for the session key (called KEYMAT, see [20, Section 2.17])
is changed to include additional key material. Structural changes
like these bear a higher risk for security and should more urgently
be accompanied by formal verification.
2.2 Previous analyses of IKE(v2)
IKEv1 and IKEv2 were not formally analyzed until after their re-
spective standardization in RFC 2409 [18] and RFC 4306 [21]. The
specifications explain why the protocols are believed to fulfill cer-
tain security goals, but do neither define these goals formally nor
prove that they are fulfilled. A first formal analysis of IKE(v1) (using
the automatic NRL Protocol Analyzer) found some security flaws
in its design [29].
Additionally, IKE(v1) was subject to non-automatic formal secu-
rity analysis [4]. It supplements an earlier formalization of impor-
tant notions, such as protocols in general and key-exchange protocols
in particular, attackers against such protocols as well as for sessions
and session-key security [3] with a concrete example. Using this
understanding, IPsec SAs can be interpreted as sessions for the com-
munication partners. These definitions have since played a central
role in automated verification of protocols.
IKEv2 – which obsoletes IKE(v1) – was formally modeled and
verified with the Scyther tool for automatic proofs by Cremers [8].
The analysis revealed some weaknesses of IKEv2’s authentication
mechanism. We compare our results to his to verify the correctness
92A formal analysis of IKEv2’s post-quantum extension

of our model and proofs. Apart from those attempts at formal
verification of IKE and IKEv2, there exists significant work on
attacker models, key exchange models, and the security properties
of IKE(v2) and similar protocols. Chapter 3 refers to them in greater
detail.
2.3 Formal analysis of other protocols
Formal verification has been used for other popular key exchange
protocols recently. Tamarin [30, 34] was used to analyze the Noise
key exchange protocol framework, which later provided the basis
for a formal analysis of the Wireguard key exchange [12, 13]. It
was also used frequently during the development of the TLS 1.3
standard [32]: For every revision of the proposal, the security model
was adjusted and verified again [9]. Other protocols that recently
received attention by formal analysis are the PKCS#11 standard [10]
and the Signal protocol for private messaging with smartphones [6].
The latter motivates recent standard activities to establish a protocol
for Message Layer Security (MLS), which aims to secure group
communication for different smartphone messaging services [2]. A
first version of the protocol is formally analyzed in [7], a procedure
the IETF aims to continue during the standardization process of
the new protocol.
3 PROTOCOL MODEL
IKEv2 is not only the key exchange protocol for IPsec, but also
manages the IPsec SAs; this results in a multitude of extensions.
Modeling all possible states, messages and error codes of the proto-
col would exceed the capabilities of an automatic prover, which is
why we focus on a minimal subset. RFC 7815 [25] provides this in
the form of Minimal-IKEv2, specifying that the agreement of keys
between the peers is the minimal subset of a standard-conform
implementation. Particularly, it leaves out advanced authentication
modes like EAP or certificate validation. We use this subset for our
model. More complex scenarios as well as adaptions and extensions
of the protocol may be modeled on the basis of this later on.
Figure 1 shows the Minimal-IKEv2 state machine. start indi-
cates that in this session, Initiator and Responder have not com-
municated at all yet. Every other state is reached at the end of the
corresponding key agreement step:
IKE_SA_INIT Initiator The Initiator chooses a private ephemeral
key eI for the DH-exchange, calculates the public ephemeral
key epI and sends it to the Responder together with a Nonce_i
in an IKE_SA_INIT message. The message also contains a
list of proposed key exchange methods.
IKE_SA_INIT Responder The Responder also chooses a private
ephemeral key eR and uses it to calculate the shared DH-
key. Together with Nonce_r and Nonce_i, this shared key
is used to derive the session key (called keymat), typically
by hashing. The public ephemeral key, Nonce_r, and a selec-
tion of key exchange methods from the Initiator’s proposal
comprise the Responder’s IKE_SA_INIT message, which he
sends to the Initiator.
IKE_AUTH Initiator Upon receiving the IKE_SA_INIT response,
the Initiator also calculates the shared DH key and derives
the session key keymat. For authentication, the Initiator signs
his own IKE_SA_INIT message with his private static key,
thereby also proving that the IKE_SA_INIT message was
sent by him. The IKE_AUTH message itself is also signed and
sent to the Responder.
IKE_AUTH Responder The Responder verifies the signature with
the Initiator’s public static key, and proves his own iden-
tity by signing the IKE_AUTH response as well as his own
IKE_SA_INIT message with his own private static key and
sending them to the Initiator.
IKE_AUTH Done As a last step, the Initiator verifies the signature of
the Responder; this completes the exchange. Both peers now
share a common SA, which can be used for communication
with IKEv2 or deriving new so-called Child-SAs for other
IPsec protocols.
We assume an IKEv2 session to only be valid if the final state
IKE_AUTH Done is reached. We therefore prove that the states in
question can be reached:
Correctness There exist sessions for both roles (Initiator and Re-
sponder) where the communication agents have established
key material and those sessions can exist at the same time.3
Next, we define an attacker model before presenting the security
properties which are to be met if such an attacker exists.
3.1 The Dolev-Yao attacker model
The Dolev-Yao attacker model [11] is very commonly used for
formal analyses [13]. It allows the attacker to act with the powers
of a message carrier, i.e., to eavesdrop, to hold back, resend, or
modify a message, and to send fresh messages. An attacker is called
“passive” if they only eavesdrop on the network. Interaction makes
an attacker “active”. Oracles can be introduced in the model, too, to
identify weaknesses from leakage of sensitive information.
3.2 Security properties
The most important security goals of IKEv2 are informally stated to
be “identity protection” and “key secrecy” [20]. The security prop-
erties of authenticated key exchange protocols have been defined
and refined in several related works, among them [4], [26], [8], and
[13].
We use their respective definitions of the following seven prop-
erties; changes to the cited definitions are marked by “[ ]”. The
properties are defined assuming that two communication partners
A and B intend to establish a connection using IKEv2 with each
other.
The first three properties, namely Aliveness, Weak Agreement,
and Agreement, were first discussed by Lowe in [27] as different
levels of authentication:
Aliveness We say that a protocol guarantees to an initiator A alive-
ness of another agent B if, whenever A (acting as initiator)
completes a run of the protocol, apparently with responder B,
then B has previously been running the protocol.[27, Chap-
ter 2.1] As Lowe states: “Many protocols fail to achieve even
this weak form of authentication.”[ibid.]
Weak Agreement We say that a protocol guarantees to an initiator
A weak agreement with another agent B if, whenever A
3Proving this statement also aids the automatic prover in proving the properties
defined in Section 3.

(acting as initiator) completes a run of the protocol, apparently

Agreement (on a list of data items S) We say that a protocol guar-
antees to an initiator A agreement with a responder B on a set
of data items S if, whenever A (acting as initiator) completes
a run of the protocol, apparently with responder B, then B
has previously been running the protocol, apparently with A,
and was acting as responder in his run, and the two agents
agreed on the data values corresponding to all the variables in
