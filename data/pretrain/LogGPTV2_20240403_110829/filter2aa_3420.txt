Safety
DIY Destructive Devices can go wrong.
VERY WRONG!
If you ever hear someone 
with a grenade launcher 
go,
“Hey, y’all, someone hold 
my beer!  Now watch 
this!!”
RUN!
Safety 2
• WARNING! DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME! DO
NOT MAKE THESE SHELLS OR BUILD THIS
SYSTEM
• Do NOT disassemble 37mm or 40mm shells!
• We are experts. No, really. 
• Please do not do this. 
• If you want, call/email us. We will happily 
discuss it with you, including the possible 
dangers.
Safety 3
Hand Orientation
Right hand on pistol grip
Left hand BEHIND the shell
Not on ‘hand guard’
Fragmentation Vest
Flash Suit
Gloves
Helmet
Eye Protection
Ear Protection
No Such thing as overkill when its your 
fingers and eyeballs
Legality
• 37mm vs. 40mm 
•Non-DD vs Destructive Device
• NFA 1934
• ¼ Ounce of 
Explosive/Propellant/Lift 
Charge
• PC 120301(a)(4) – “Penal 
Code” ($200,000 fine + Jail 
time)
Capability 37mm non-DD
•1/2lb projectile 400 meters 
range
•1/4lb 400 feet vertically
•25000 PSI in high pressure 
chamber
Why our system is not DD
•Total weight of lift charge/payload
•Intent – Signal, Search and Rescue
•Non-antipersonnel
•37mm
•Never ever aim at individuals.
