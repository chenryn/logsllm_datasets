### Apache Airflow version
Other Airflow 2 version (please specify below)
### What happened
Hello ,
We were trying to execute airflow CLI commands for "airflow tasks" in MWAA.
While testing these commands , we observed that below "airflow tasks" cli
command are parsing parsing all DAGs file then execute provided airflow tasks
command.
**Commands** :  
airflow tasks clear  
airflow tasks failed-deps  
airflow tasks run  
airflow tasks test
### What you think should happen instead
We are expecting that when to execute "airflow tasks" cli command, it should
only parse DAG name and task name provided in the command and not parse DAG
lists followed by task list.
### How to reproduce
  1. We created web logic token to access web server
  2. After that, we used python script to run "airflow tasks" cli commands.
