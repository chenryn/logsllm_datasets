User: I want to transform a python script in a executable file. That is why, I want to install py2exe
When I try to install the file "py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe", I got the message "Python version 2.7 required, which was not found in the registry"
I suspect that py2exe is not finding my python.exe file (it ask me python directory but I cannot enter anything).
Python 2.7.9 is installed on my laptop in the file Mydocuments (and I cannot not move the path)!
I use Windows 8.
Thank you a lot for your help and for your answer
Assistant: Just unpack this exe with tool like 7-zip and you can run py2exe from resulting folder.
