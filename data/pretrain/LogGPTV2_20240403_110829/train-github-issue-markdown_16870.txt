Debugging a Node program that uses util.inspect hangs the underlying node
process.
I stumbled across this while working on an app that depends on the Azure
Storage SDK for Node (it uses util.inspect). I don't have a workaround for
debugging right now, but the app works fine when running directly from the
command line.
I've created a repro of the problem here:  
https://gist.github.com/benquarmby/36f6c00947ad04509212
Steps:
  * Create a script that invokes util.inspect on an object
  * Place a breakpoint in the script _after_ the call util.inspect
  * Start debugging
  * Observe that the breakpoint is not hit
Environment:
  * VSCode 0.10.6
  * Windows 10 x64
  * Node 5.5 x64
