#### Introduction
We observed that local resolvers are often assigned /24 blocks, with more such blocks allocated to local resolvers compared to public ones, with the exception of Sprint. The latency measurements for these resolvers are presented in Figure 11, which shows cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for different carriers in our study.

#### Key Findings
- **Proximity and Latency**: For carriers whose resolvers responded to our probes, the cellular DNS (cell DNS) is generally closer to clients than public DNS resolvers. This is expected since public DNS resolvers are located outside the cellular network, requiring resolution requests to leave the cellular network.
- **Latency Differences**:
  - For US carriers, the median latency for cell DNS resolvers is 10-25 ms lower than the best public DNS resolver.
  - For South Korean operators, the median resolution time for public DNS resolvers is nearly twice as long as that of the cell DNS.
- **Performance Consistency**: Public DNS services exhibit greater performance consistency and a shorter tail in resolution times compared to cell DNS. For T-Mobile, public DNS resolvers performed equally or better over 40% of the time.

#### Resolver Consistency
In addition to analyzing the structure and performance of public DNS, we also explored the consistency of client-resolver mappings, focusing on Google Public DNS. Despite using anycast, users are directed to multiple /24 blocks of resolvers at different geographic locations, each representing one of 30 distinct resolver clusters. This inconsistency may be due to the widespread use of tunneling (e.g., via MPLS).

#### Public DNS Performance
Figure 13 compares domain resolution times for locally configured DNS, GoogleDNS, and OpenDNS. Our results show that in most cases, the locally configured resolver provides faster domain name resolutions. While public DNS resolvers have longer average resolution times, they exhibit lower variance and a shorter tail in response times compared to cellular operator resolvers.

#### Public DNS Replica Performance
We measured the performance of replicas selected by public DNS resolvers. Figure 14 shows the cumulative distribution of the percentage difference in performance between the replica servers returned by each public DNS resolver and the locally configured one. The aggregation shifts the results toward equal performance, with 60-80% of the relative latency being zero for all providers in the US and South Korea. This indicates similar performance between cell networks and public DNS on average.

#### Discussion
Our analysis highlights critical issues with current cellular DNS infrastructures and their impact on content distribution. The opaqueness of cellular DNS and the inconsistency in client-resolver mappings can lead to suboptimal replica selection. For example, within Verizon, client-facing and external-facing DNS resolvers are within separate autonomous systems (ASes). This opaqueness means that even though many CDNs use DNS-based replica selection for mobile clients, they cannot accurately measure the distance from their replicas to these resolvers or place them in respective network coordinates.

#### Conclusion and Future Work
We presented a detailed analysis of cellular network DNS infrastructure and its implications on CDN replica selection. Our work, motivated by the need for accurate client localization in next-generation networks, reveals several issues impacting content delivery in modern cellular networks. We found that despite their greater distance from mobile devices, remote public resolvers yield comparable performance in replica selection to cellular provider DNS. Future work will extend this characterization to other markets and explore alternative approaches for improving CDN performance through better client localization.
