This derives from the browser console, which is the only thing comparable to
Deno's terminal repl.
As of right now, the repl is a normal script, I believe that it would be more
helpful to anyone using it If it were a module allowing imports, and with top-
level await, as most of Deno is promise focused.
I believe it to be reasonable to derive from the browser in this case as the
repl / console is often used for something simple and short, and having more
utility there would be helpful, and it shouldn't break any backward
compatibility as scripts aren't intended to be programmatically run there.
The console is merely a simple tool to help us out, is it not? What could go
wrong?
If anything, having an optional flag wouldn't be that bad,
Maybe something like so: ` deno --repl=module`
