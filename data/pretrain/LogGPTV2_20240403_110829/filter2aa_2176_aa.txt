### Introduction

### Disclaimer
- IP addresses and host names in the event graphs and descriptions have been obfuscated/changed.
- The addresses are completely random, and any resemblance to well-known addresses or host names is purely coincidental.

### Text or Visuals?
- **Which would you rather look at?**
  - **Textual Logs**:
    ```plaintext
    Jun 17 09:42:30 rmarty ifup: Determining IP information for eth0...
    Jun 17 09:42:35 rmarty ifup:  failed; no link present.  Check cable?
    Jun 17 09:42:35 rmarty network: Bringing up interface eth0:  failed
    ...
    ```
  - **Visual Representation**:
    - A picture tells more than a thousand log lines.

---

### Why Use Event Graphs?
- **Visual Representation of Textual Information (Logs and Events)**
- **Display of Most Important Properties**
- **Reduction in Analysis and Response Times**
  - Quickly visualize thousands of events.
  - A picture tells more than a thousand log lines.
- **Situational Awareness**
  - Visualize the status of business posture.
- **Facilitate Communication**
  - Use graphs to communicate with other teams.
  - Graphs are easier to understand than textual events.

---

### When to Use Event Graphs
- **Real-time Monitoring**
  - What is happening in a specific business area (e.g., compliance monitoring).
  - What is happening on a specific network.
  - What certain servers are doing.
  - Look at specific aspects of events.
- **Forensics and Investigations**
  - Selecting an arbitrary set of events for investigation.
  - Understanding the big picture.
  - Analyzing relationships.

### Basics
- **How to Draw an Event Graph?**
  - **Parser**: Parses raw log data.
  - **Normalization**: Normalizes the parsed data.
  - **Event Analyzer/Visualizer**: Analyzes and visualizes the normalized data.
  - **Log File** → **Event Graph**

- **Different Node Configurations**
  - Example Raw Event:
    ```plaintext
    [**] [1:1923:2] RPC portmap UDP proxy attempt [**]
    [Classification: Decode of an RPC Query] [Priority: 2] 
    06/04-15:56:28.219753 192.168.10.90:32859 -> 192.168.10.255:111
    UDP TTL:64 TOS:0x0 ID:0 IpLen:20 DgmLen:148 DF Len: 120
    ```
  - Different node configurations can be created based on the data fields.

### AfterGlow – Peak Preview
- **AfterGlow is not a SIM (Security Information and Event Management) tool**; it does not include parsers (except for tcpdump and sendmail).
- **Demo of the tool for use at home and in the Jacuzzi.**
  - Thanks to Christian @ ArcSight!
- **Process**:
  - **CSV File** → **Parser** → **AfterGlow** → **Graph Language File** → **Grapher**
  - Command: `cat input.csv | ./afterglow.pl –c color.properties | neato –Tgif –o output.gif`
  - **Color Properties**:
    ```plaintext
    color.source="red" 
    color.event="green" 
    color.target="blue"
    ```

### Situational Awareness
- **Real-time Monitoring with a Dashboard**
- **Forensic and Historical Analysis**
