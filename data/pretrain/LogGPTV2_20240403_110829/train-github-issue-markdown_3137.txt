 **Symfony version(s) affected** : 4.2.5
**Description**  
If some listeners are removed from `ContainerAwareEventManager` before being
initialized they can not be added back if any event was dispatched in the
meantime. This happens because `dispatchEvent` marks specific groups of events
as initialized BUT `addEventListener` checks whether anything was intialized
**Possible Solution**  
Maybe if a listeners is a string the container should be always checked
whether it has a service defined under that name? That should allow adding
lazy loaded listeners after construction. Other option might be to initialize
listeners in `getListeners` but I don't know how it is used internally by
Symfony.
**Additional context**  
In our app we're disabling and re-enabling Doctrine events mostly to disable
FosElastica events for batch operations. This is no longer possible.
