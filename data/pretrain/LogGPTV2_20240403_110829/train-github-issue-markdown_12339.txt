VSCode support extension, that's good. but i found extension will not auto
update. nor auto check update , nor notify us to update.
So i suggest can you please improve extension update?
  1. Auto check update
  2. Notify user to update or not
  3. User can setting check up frequency(every start? one day? one week?)
  4. The check update can be put in background, not slow down the main VSCode window
  5. Check update can be single/mutiple request. (If installed multiple extensions. check update may slow )
  6. If user choose update, then download new extensions one by one and installed or down them simultaneouslyl and installed
