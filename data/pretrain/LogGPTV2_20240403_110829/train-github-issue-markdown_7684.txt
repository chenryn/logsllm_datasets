**Stephen M. Wick** opened **SPR-3797** and provided the following comments:

In Spring versions up to v2.0.2, the `MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean` cannot be used in a clustered Quartz deployment. I am attaching a cluster-safe version of Spring's `MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean` and a new `BeanInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean` for your review and potential inclusion in the Spring framework.

### Overview

- **MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean**: This FactoryBean can invoke a method on a Java object. Both the object and its method arguments must be serializable. Alternatively, it can invoke a static method on any class by specifying the class name (as a string) and the static method to invoke. The method arguments must also be serializable. For more information, please refer to the Javadoc within the source code.
- **BeanInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean**: This FactoryBean can invoke a method on any bean defined within the Spring ApplicationContext. The method arguments must be serializable. For more details, please refer to the Javadoc within the source code.

### Limitations with MS SQL Server and Quartz 1.6.0

As of Quartz 1.6.0, there is a known bug that prevents objects from being serialized to MS SQL Server, which is required for Quartz clustering. (For more information, see [this forum post](http://forums.opensymphony.com/messa...ssageID=128249)).

Until Quartz 1.6.1 is released, the following limitations apply when using MS SQL Server:
- **MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean**: Restricted to invoking static methods with no arguments.
- **BeanInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean**: Restricted to invoking methods with no arguments.

### Feedback Requested

Please let me know if you encounter any issues with these FactoryBeans. I am also looking for feedback on their usefulness and any suggestions for improvement.

I hope these components will save you time and effort!
