Through Spring v2.0.2, MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean cannot be used
within a clustered Quartz deployment.
I am attaching a cluster-safe version of Spring's
MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean, and a new BeanInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean
for your review and possible inclusion in the Spring framework offering.
MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean can be used to invoke a method on a Java
Object. The Object and method arguments must be Serializable. Alternatively,
you can configure this FactoryBean to invoke a Static method on any Class by
specifying the name of the Class, as a String, and the name of the Static
Method to invoke. Again, the method arguments must be Serializable. (See the
JavaDoc within the source for more information)
BeanInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean can be used to invoke a method on any bean
defined within the Spring ApplicationContext. The method arguments must be
Serializable. (See the JavaDoc within the source for more information)
Note : As of Quartz 1.6.0 there is a bug that prevents Objects from being
Serialized to the MS SQL Server (required for Quartz Clustering). (See
http://forums.opensymphony.com/messa...ssageID=128249)  
Therefore, the following limitations apply to those using MS SQL Server until
Quartz 1.6.1 is released:  
MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean is restricted to Static No-Arg Method
Invocation.  
BeanInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean is restricted to No-Arg Method Invocation.
Please let me know if you have issues with these FactoryBeans. I am also
looking for feedback on how useful, or not, these components are.
I hope these components save you time and effort!
