Compiling the following code:
    "use strict";
    export default class {};
Using the command line `tsc --t es6 --m commonjs` produces illegal JavaScript:
    "use strict";
    class {
    }
    exports.default = default_1
    ;
I realize this is a weird combination of switches, however it seems necessary
to target current versions of Node.js/V8 that don't yet natively support ES6
modules.
