## Historical Context
### When Did It All Start?
The term "Trojan" was coined by Ken Thompson in 1983. Since the 1980s, Trojans have been used to gain and maintain privileged access to computers through various means:
- **Keyloggers and Fake Login Screens:** These tools capture sensitive information such as passwords.
- **Rootkits and Backdoors:** These allow attackers to maintain persistent access to a system.
- **Trivial Trojans:** These simply delete files or cause other forms of disruption.

### The Hype Begins
- **Defcon 7.0 (2000):** BO2K, a popular backdoor tool, is released, garnering significant media attention.
- **2001:** Magic Lantern, reportedly developed by the FBI, replaces hardware keyloggers.
- **2007:** The German authorities propose the "Bundestrojaner" to enable "online searches" on suspects' computers, generating over 600,000 Google hits and sparking public concern. The estimated development cost is around €200,000.

## Reality of Malware
### Growth of Malware and Potentially Unwanted Programs
- **Malware and PUPs:** The number of viruses, Trojans, and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) has grown significantly from 1997 to 2006.
- **Samples Sent to McAfee Research:** Data from 2005 and 2006 shows a shift in the types of malware, with Trojans and bots becoming more prevalent.

### Fastest Growing Trojan Types
- **Password Stealers, Downloaders, and Backdoors:** These are the fastest-growing types of Trojans from 1997 to 2006.
- **Q1 2007 Password Stealing Trojan Targets:** Specific variants like Banker, LegMir, Lineage, Gamania, WoW, LDPinch, Zhengtu, QQPass, and Goldun have been particularly active.

### Real Data from Customers
- **Detection Statistics (Last 18 Months):** Various malware and PUPs have been detected, with W32/Sober@mm!681 being the most prevalent.
- **Trends in 2007 Q1:** There has been a 33% increase in vulnerabilities, a 34% increase in classified viruses and Trojans, and an 8% decrease in PUPs. Additionally, 85% of all email is considered spam.

## Malware for Money
### Financial Motivation
- **Botnets and Adware:** Botnets are commonly used to install adware on compromised machines, with pay-per-install programs ranging from $0.05 to $0.50 per installation.
- **Advertised Prices for Stolen Data:** Various items, including credit card details, email lists, and online accounts, are sold at different prices on the black market.

### Cost of Cybercrime Tools
- **Examples of Cybercrime Tools:**
  - Snatch Trojan: $600
  - FTP Checker: $15
  - Dream Bot Builder: $500 + $25 for updates
  - Pinch: $30 + $5 for updates
  - Keylogger Teller 2.0: $40
  - Webmoney Trojan: $500
  - WMT-spy: $5 (executable), $5 (updates), $10 (builder)
  - MPACK: $700

## Techniques and Tactics
### Obfuscating Trojans
- **Runtime Packers:** Common packers used by malware include MEW, RPCrypt, FSG, Themida, ASpack, NSpack, and UPX.

### Typical Outbreak Scenario
- **Example: Downloader-AAP**
  1. User opens a zip attachment and double-clicks the executable.
  2. The downloader fetches a text file.
  3. The text file is decoded.
  4. Binaries are downloaded from the decoded URL, which includes a dropper (Spy-Agent.ba) for the actual Trojan.
  5. The dropper installs IPV6MOML.DLL in the system directory.
  6. The DLL is registered as a Browser Helper Object.

### Another Example: Spam-Mespam
- **Infection Vector:** Arrives via email, IM messages, and web forums, leading users to a malicious website.
- **Propagation:** Spreads by injecting links and text into emails and IM communications, leveraging social engineering.

### Victim Distribution
- **Geographical Distribution:** Europe, North America, and APAC regions show varying levels of infection.

### New Command and Control (C&C) Methods
- **Communication Channels:**
  - IRC (public and private servers)
  - Rented and owned systems
  - HTTP and HTTPS
  - P2P networks
  - XML for communication to avoid detection

### Bruteforce and Social Engineering
- **Bruteforce:**
  - Exploits on websites, multimedia files, and Office documents.
- **Social Engineering:**
  - Executables embedded in documents, fake codecs, and deceptive email subjects.

### Rootkits
- **Increasing Prevalence:** Approximately 200,000 systems reported rootkit infestations in 2007, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2006.
- **Detection and Removal:** Requires two steps: detecting and removing the rootkit, followed by detecting and removing the Trojan.
- **Free Tool:** McAfee Rootkit Detective
