User: Please explain in detail what is CDN and why is CDN used in the application?
Assistant: The full name of CDN is Content Delivery Network, that is, content distribution network. CDN is an intelligent virtual network built on the existing Internet. It publishes the content of the source site to the node closest to the user, so that the user can obtain the desired content nearby, reduce the delay of content acquisition, and improve the download speed and user experience. There are several reasons for using CDN in applications: 1. Enhance user experience. Since the CDN is distributed in nodes all over the world, users can directly obtain the required content from the node closest to them, avoiding long delays and low-speed downloads caused by network congestion or long distances, thereby improving web page loading speed and user access experience . 2. Improve usability and stability. CDN can realize automatic load balancing and failover. When a node fails or goes down, the request will be automatically forwarded to other nodes in the same area, ensuring that users can quickly access the required content and improving the stability and availability of the website. 3. Reduce the pressure on the origin site. Because the CDN caches the data of the origin site, when the user requests access, it will first obtain static data from the CDN node, and only when the request involves dynamic data will the origin site be accessed, which reduces the load pressure on the origin site and improves the performance of the source site. performance and stability. To sum up, CDN can improve user experience and website availability, stability and performance, and is an indispensable part of modern web applications.
