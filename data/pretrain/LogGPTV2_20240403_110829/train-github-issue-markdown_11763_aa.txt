I was trying to add profiler to the existing tensorflow object detection API,
the following part of code is added to
tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/learning.py
Line 489 in dfa0f87
|  
---|---  
      if run_metadata is not None:
        logging.info('Added profiling by User')
        ProfileOptionBuilder = profiler.ProfileOptionBuilder
        opts = ProfileOptionBuilder(ProfileOptionBuilder.time_and_memory()).with_step(np_global_step).with_timeline_output(train_step_kwargs['logdir']+'/profile.json').build()
        logging.info(train_step_kwargs['logdir']+'/profile.json')
        profiler.profile(
            ops.get_default_graph(),
            run_meta=run_metadata,
            cmd='graph',
            options=opts)
but when I was trying to run the training for resnet_101_coco with no other
changes, the training progress with no error, but the profiler output
incompatible shapes:
