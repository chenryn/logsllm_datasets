### Troubleshooting
The error indicates that the `atom` executable is not found at the specified path. This could be due to an incorrect build directory or a misconfiguration in the installation script. 

To resolve this issue, ensure that the build directory is correctly set and that the `atom` binary is properly installed. You may need to check the build logs for any errors or warnings that might have occurred during the build process.
