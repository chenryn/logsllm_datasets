User: How to conduct system log analysis to discover abnormal behavior and risks?
Assistant: System log analysis can be performed to discover abnormal behavior and risks through the following steps: 1. Collect data: collect data from the system and store it in a centralized repository, such as Rizhiyi, Graylog, Splunk, etc. 2. Filter data: filter out data related to abnormal behaviors and risks based on keywords. 3. Visual analysis: Visualize data as charts to quickly understand fault analysis and find abnormalities. 4. Create and update rules: Create rules to detect and discover potential anomalous behaviors and risks. These rules can include alerts based on specific patterns and behaviors, such as users opening a large number of system emails; accessing the system at unusual times; or launching unknown binaries. 5. Monitor alerts: Generate alerts based on rules to see if each alert represents a real risk. If the alert is a false positive, the rules need to be updated to avoid the same error. 6. Collect feedback information: After receiving an alert and taking action, collect relevant information and data, which will help/improve better identification and prevention of possible future risks. The above steps are the basic steps for system log analysis to discover abnormal behaviors and risks. It needs constant refinement and refinement.
