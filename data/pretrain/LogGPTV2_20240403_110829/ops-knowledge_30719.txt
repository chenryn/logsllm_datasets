User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Error when connecting to Windows Server 2003 using Remote Desktop I've got a Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard SP2 running. When I try to connect to this server using Remote Desktop I get the following error popup:

"The system cannot log you on due to the following error: The RPC server is unavailable."

In the event log of the server I get the following event:
"Logon rejected for Domain\administrator. Unable to obtain Terminal Server User Configuration. Error: The RPC server is unavailable." (Source: Winlogon, Event ID: 1219)

What can I do to fix this problem? I got no clue which RPC server this refers to.

Assistant: Create the following Registry key
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server
Name: IgnoreRegUserConfigErrors
Type: REG_DWORD
Value: 1

Reboot the server, and try logging in via RDP.
