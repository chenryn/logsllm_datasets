The collapse js plugin should be made more flexible by not requiring a
wrapping .panel for data-parent to work. The "show only one at a time"
functionality is useful outside of accordions and without panel-like styling.
Fixing this is as easy as changing the selector in
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.0.2/js/collapse.js#L51 to something
purely semantic that doesn't come with styles -- try `> .collapse-group > .in`
for example.
Also note that the docs do not explicitly mention what the DOM should be for
data-parent to work.
