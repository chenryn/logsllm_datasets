To enhance the flexibility of the collapse JavaScript plugin, it should not require a wrapping `.panel` for the `data-parent` attribute to function. The "show only one at a time" feature is valuable in contexts beyond accordions and without the need for panel-like styling.

This can be achieved by modifying the selector in the collapse.js file (line 51) to a more semantic one that does not enforce specific styles. For example, you could use `> .collapse-group > .in`.

Additionally, the documentation currently lacks explicit instructions on the required DOM structure for the `data-parent` attribute to work properly.

For further context, please refer to the discussion in issue #10023.
