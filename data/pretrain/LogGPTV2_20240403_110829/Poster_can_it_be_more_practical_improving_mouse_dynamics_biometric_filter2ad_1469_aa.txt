**Abstract:**
Mouse dynamics is a biometric method that verifies the identity of computer users based on their unique mouse operating characteristics, derived from movement and click events. While some researchers have reported encouraging results, few have focused on practical applicability in real-world settings. Many existing approaches require an impractically long verification time to achieve reasonable accuracy. In this work, we investigate the mouse dynamics of 26 subjects under a tightly-controlled environment. By using procedural features such as speed and acceleration curves to more accurately characterize mouse activity, and adopting distance metrics to overcome within-class variability, we achieved a promising performance with a false-acceptance rate of 8.87%, a false-rejection rate of 7.16%, and an average verification time of 11.8 seconds. Our findings suggest that while this level of accuracy is close to meeting the requirements of identity verification, a tradeoff must be made between security and user acceptability. We also suggest opportunities for further investigation through additional controlled experimental environments.

**1. Introduction**
As the internet becomes increasingly powerful and convenient, more and more computer applications allow people to access information and resources globally and ubiquitously. With the growth of the internet, there is a growing need for a reliable and convenient security mechanism to authenticate computer users. This need is especially strong as more important data are moved to the cloud, accessible to anyone with a registered account. One technique that has attracted increasing interest is mouse dynamics, which measures and evaluates a user's mouse operating characteristics. These measures, based on movements and clicks, are compared to a legitimate user's profile to identify or verify the user. Revett et al. provide a review of this field [1].

While previous studies have shown promising results in mouse dynamics, they often require a long verification time to collect and analyze enough mouse activity data before achieving a reasonably accurate identity verification [2, 6]. For example, one approach [2] achieved an average Equal Error Rate (EER) of 3% but required a verification time of around 17 minutes. This limits the applicability for large-scale deployment in real systems, as more than 3 minutes is too long for user authentication during a login process. Additionally, for identity monitoring, even a few minutes can be enough for an adversary to compromise a system.

In this study, we adopt procedural features such as speed and acceleration curves to more precisely characterize the nature of mouse behavior. We also employ the edit distance [9] to overcome within-class variability and preserve between-class differences. Previous studies have favored using data from real-world environments, which introduced unintended side effects due to different mouse devices and operating environments [10]. Our tightly-controlled experimental environment isolates inherent behavioral characteristics as the primary factor in the analysis of behavioral data, greatly reducing the effects of external confounding factors. Based on our approach, we achieved an encouraging improvement with a false-acceptance rate of 8.87%, a false-rejection rate of 7.16%, and an average verification time of only 11.8 seconds, which approaches a practical standard for identity verification.

**2. Data Collection**

**2.1 Controlled Environment**
In this study, we set up a desktop machine to collect data and developed a Windows application that prompts a subject to conduct a pre-defined mouse-operating pattern under instructions. We could only collect data from one subject at a time and made every effort to control software and hardware factors to avoid any unintended influence on the subject's recorded mouse behavior. The desktop was an HP workstation with a Core 2 Duo 3.0 GHz processor and 2GB of RAM, equipped with a 17" HP LCD monitor (set at 1280×1024 resolution). We used a USB HP optical mouse and ran the Windows XP operating system. We chose to sacrifice some amount of realism to use this carefully-controlled data-collection apparatus, ensuring a consistent environment for all subjects.

**2.2 Mouse-Operation Design**
To create a mouse-operating pattern that is representative of typical combinations of mouse actions, we designed a fixed pattern based on two commonly used properties in mouse movement: movement direction and movement distance, and two basic characteristics in mouse click: single click and double click [5]. In this pattern, eight directions are considered, each covering movements performed within a 45-degree area. Three distance intervals are included, ranging from 0 to 200 pixels, 200 to 600 pixels, and 600 to 800 pixels, respectively. The choice of movement distance and direction is based on the literature [2, 5], which covers the most common and discriminative mouse actions in users' daily mouse operations. Based on these properties, we constructed a typical and representative mouse-operating pattern containing eight types of mouse movements with various directions and distances, and two types of mouse click actions (single-click and double-click). During data collection, every two adjacent movements are separated by mouse click actions, and all actions are repeated twice to obtain one sample of the mouse-operating pattern.

**2.3 Running Subjects**
We recruited 26 subjects, many from within our lab and some from the university at large. We required subjects to conduct the data collection at least twice, with at least 24 hours between sessions to ensure some day-to-day variation. All 26 subjects remained in the study, contributing 150 samples.

**3. Feature Extraction**

**3.1 Feature Extraction**
To extract features that determine an individual user's mouse behavioral characteristics and validate their identity, we first characterized mouse behavior based on two basic types of mouse actions: click and movement. Each action was further analyzed individually and translated into several mouse features. This study divides these features into two categories: static features and procedural features. Static features characterize the constituents of mouse actions during interactions, including single-click statistics, double-click statistics, movement offset, and movement time. Procedural features characterize the efficiency, agility, and motion habits of individual mouse actions, including movement speed and acceleration. It should be noted that by using procedural features such as speed and acceleration curves, one can more precisely characterize the nature of mouse behavior.
