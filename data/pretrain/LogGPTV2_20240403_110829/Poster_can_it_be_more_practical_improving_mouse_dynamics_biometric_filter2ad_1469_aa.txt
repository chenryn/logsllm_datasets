ABSTRACT 
Mouse  dynamics  is  the  process  of  verifying  the  identity  of 
computer  users  on 
their  mouse  operating 
characteristics,  which  are  derived  from  the  movement  and  click 
events. Some researchers have explored this domain and reported 
encouraging results, but few focused on applicability in a realistic 
setting. Specifically, many of the existing approaches require an 
impractically  long  verification  time  to  achieve  a  reasonable 
accuracy. In this work, we investigate the mouse dynamics of 26 
subjects under a tightly-controlled environment. Using procedural 
features such as speed and acceleration curves to more accurately 
characterize  mouse  activity,  and  adopting  distance  metrics  to 
overcome  the  within-class  variability,  we  achieved  a  promising 
performance  with  a  false-acceptance  rate  of  8.87%,  a  false-
rejection rate of 7.16%, and an average verification time of 11.8 
seconds. We find that while this level of accuracy comes close to 
meeting the requirements of identity verification, a tradeoff must 
be made between security and user acceptability. We also suggest 
opportunities 
through  additional, 
controlled experimental environments.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
As  the  internet  becomes  increasingly  powerful  and  convenient, 
more  and  more  computer  applications  allow  people  to  access 
information  and  resources  globally  and  ubiquitously.  Growing 
with  the  development  of  internet  is  the  thirst  for  a  reliable  and

the  proposed  approaches  may  require  a 
convenient  security  mechanism  to  authenticate  a  computer  user. 
This  thirst  becomes  much  stronger  as  more  and  more  important 
data are moved to the Cloud (e.g. Dropbox), which is accessible 
to  anyone  with  a  registered  account.  Of  the  various  potential 
solutions to protect the security of internet identity, one technique 
that has attracted more and more interest is mouse dynamics – the 
procedure for measuring and evaluating a user’s mouse operating 
characteristics. These measures, based largely on movements and 
clicks of the mouse, are compared to a legitimate user’s profile; a 
match  or  non-match  can  be  used  as  a  biometric  to  identify  or 
verify the user. Revett et al. provide a review of this field [1].

data  before  a  reasonably  accurate  identity  verification  can  be 
made [2, 6]. For instance, the approach of [2] achieved an average 
EER of 3% but with the verification time around 17 minutes. This 
limits  the  applicability  for  a  large  scale  deployment  in  real 
systems, since more than 3 minutes is too long to authenticate a 
user in a login process, while for identity monitoring even a few 
minutes is enough for an adversary to compromise a system. This 
study,  by  adopting  procedural  features,  such  as  speed  and 
acceleration curves, allows one to more precisely characterize the 
nature  of  mouse  behavior.  Moreover,  we  employed  the  edit 
distance [9] to overcome within-class variability and to preserve 
between-class differences. 
Previous  studies  have  favored  using  data  from  real-world 
environments.  This  introduced  unintended  side-effects  (different 
mouse  devices,  operating  environments,  etc.)  as  complicated

2.  DATA COLLECTION 
2.1  Controlled Environment 
In this study, we set up a desktop machine to collect the data, and 
we  developed  a  Windows  application  that  prompts  a  subject  to 
conduct the pre-fixed mouse-operating pattern under instructions.  
853We could only collect data from one subject at a time; we made 
every effort to control software and hardware factors from having 
any  unintended  influence  on  the  subject’s  recorded  mouse 
behavior. The desktop was an HP workstation with a Core 2 Duo 
3.0 GHz processor and 2GB of RAM; it was equipped with a 17” 
HP LCD monitor (set at 1280×1024 resolution). We equipped the 
computer  with  a  USB  HP  optical  mouse,  running  the  Windows 
XP  operating  system.  We  chose  to  sacrifice  some  amount  of 
realism  so  we  could  use  this  carefully-controlled  data-collection 
apparatus. The reason for this decision is that we wanted to make 
the environment as consistent as possible for all subjects.  
2.2  Mouse-operation Design 
To  make  a  mouse-operating  pattern  that  is  representative  of  a 
typical  combination  of  mouse  actions,  we  designed  a  fixed 
mouse-operating pattern based on two commonly used properties 
in mouse movement: movement direction and movement distance; 
and  two  basic  characteristics  in  mouse  click:  single  click  and 
double  click  [5].  In  this  pattern,  eight  directions  are  considered, 
and each of them covers the movements performed within a 45-
degree area. In addition, three distance intervals are contained in 
this pattern, ranging from 0 pixels to 200 pixels, from 200 pixels 
to 600 pixels, and from 600 pixels to 800 pixels, respectively. The 
choice of movement distance and direction is based on the results 
in  the  literature  [2,  5],  which  covers  the  most  common  and 
discriminative  mouse  actions  in  users’  daily  mouse-operation. 
Based  on 
typical  and 
representative  mouse-operating  pattern  containing  eight  types  of 
mouse  movements  with  a  variety  of  movement  directions  and 
distances, and two types of mouse click actions (single-click and 
double-click).  During  data  collection,  every 
two  adjacent 
movements are separated by mouse click actions, and all of these 
actions are required to be repeated twice to obtain one sample of 
the mouse-operating pattern. 
2.3  Running Subjects 
We  recruited  26  subjects,  many  from  within  our  lab,  but  some 
from the university at large. We required subjects to conduct the 
data collection at least 2 repetitions of the pattern every time, and 
wait at least 24 hours for next collection (ensuring that some day-
to-day  variation  existed  within  our  sample).  All  26  subjects 
remained in the study, contributing 150 samples.

3.  FEATURE EXTRACTION 
3.1  Feature Extraction 
To  extract  features  determining  an  individual  user’s  mouse 
behavioral  characteristics  and  thus  validate  his/her  identity,  we 
first  characterized  mouse  behavior  based  on  two  basic  types  of 
mouse  actions:  click  and  movement.  Each  action  was  further 
analyzed individually, and translated into several mouse features. 
This  study  divides  these  features  into  two  categories:  static 
features  and  procedural  features.  Static  features  characterize  the 
constituents  of  mouse  actions  during  interactions,  containing 
single-click  statistics,  double-click  statistics,  movement  offset, 
and  movement 
the 
efficiency, agility and motion habits of individual mouse actions, 
including  movement  speed  and  acceleration.  It  should  be  noted 
that  by  using  the  procedural  features,  such  as  speed  and 
acceleration  curves,  one  can  more  precisely  characterize  the 
nature of mouse behavior.
