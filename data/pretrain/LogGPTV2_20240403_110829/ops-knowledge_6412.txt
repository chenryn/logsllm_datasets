### Question: Removing Perl Module Installed with `cpanm`

I am a beginner in Perl and I wanted to use the `Log::Log4perl` module, as I am familiar with its functionality in Java. Initially, I used the `cpanm` script to download and install the module, but I ran it without `sudo`. As a result, the module was installed in my home directory at `/home/amer/perl5`.

Later, I reinstalled the module with `sudo`, but now I want to remove the initial installation in my home directory to avoid any potential conflicts in the future. How can I do this?

Here is my command-line execution stack for reference.

Thank you!

### Answer

As of the latest updates, `cpanm` now supports an experimental uninstall option. According to the MetaCPAN documentation, you can use the `-U` or `--uninstall` flag to remove modules. Here are the details:

- **-U, --uninstall**
  - **EXPERIMENTAL**: This option uninstalls the specified modules by removing the distribution files from your library path using the `.packlist` file.
  - When used with `-l` or `-L`, only the files under the `local::lib` directory will be removed.
  - **NOTE**: If you have a "dual-life" module installed in multiple locations (e.g., `site_perl` and the perl library path, especially with Perl 5.12 or later), only the files in `site_perl` will be deleted.
  - If the distribution includes binary scripts and man pages, these will be retained if the core installation still references them. However, there is no guarantee that the scripts will continue to work as expected with the older version of the `.pm` files.

To remove the `Log::Log4perl` module from your home directory, you can run the following command:

```sh
cpanm -U Log::Log4perl
```

This should remove the module from the `/home/amer/perl5` directory.

Thank you and regards!
