Hi,
**Version** : VS 2015 / TS 1.5.4
To reproduce:
  * Set `"Redirect JavaScript output to directory"` to say `bin`.
  * Set `"Generate declarations files"`.
  * Set `"Compile on save"`.
  * Add file `_references.ts` to the project, with content
        /// 
    /// 
  * Build the project and check the output directory. The content of `_references.d.ts` should be
        /// 
    /// 
  * Now modify one file in the project and trigger `compile-on-save` by saving the file. Now the content of the same file should have changed to
        /// 
    /// 
This together with #4245 appears to be a regression introduced in the fix for
#3939.
This is interfering with some systems we have in place.
