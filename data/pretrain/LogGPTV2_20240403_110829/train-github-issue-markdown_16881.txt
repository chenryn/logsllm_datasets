Subject: Regression Issue in TypeScript Compilation with VS 2015 and TS 1.5.4

Hi,

**Environment:**
- Visual Studio 2015
- TypeScript 1.5.4

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Set the `Redirect JavaScript output to directory` option to `bin`.
2. Enable the `Generate declaration files` option.
3. Enable the `Compile on save` option.
4. Add a file named `_references.ts` to the project with the following content:
   ```typescript
   /// <reference path="file1.ts" />
   /// <reference path="file2.ts" />
   ```

5. Build the project and check the output directory. The content of `_references.d.ts` should be:
   ```typescript
   /// <reference path="file1.d.ts" />
   /// <reference path="file2.d.ts" />
   ```

6. Modify one of the referenced files (e.g., `file1.ts`) and trigger `compile-on-save` by saving the file. Now, the content of `_references.d.ts` should have changed to:
   ```typescript
   /// <reference path="file1.d.ts" />
   /// <reference path="file2.d.ts" />
   ```

**Issue Description:**

This issue, along with #4245, appears to be a regression introduced in the fix for #3939. This regression is interfering with some of our existing systems.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
