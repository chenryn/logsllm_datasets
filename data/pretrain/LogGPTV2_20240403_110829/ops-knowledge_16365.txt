User: How can I run a python script with my own command line name like 'myscript' without having to do 'python myscript.py' in the terminal?
Assistant: The simplest way that comes to my mind is to use "pyinstaller".

create an environment that contains all the lib you have used in your code.
activate the environment and in the command window write pip install pyinstaller
Use the command window to open the main directory that codes maincode.py is located.
remember to keep the environment active and write pyinstaller maincode.py
Check the folder named "build" and you will find the executable file.

I hope that this solution helps you.
