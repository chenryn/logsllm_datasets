### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.6.5
  * Operating System version: win10
  * Java version: 1.8
### Steps to reproduce this issue
  1. com.alibaba.dubbo.common.extension.ExtensionLoader#addExtension
    public void addExtension(String name, Class clazz) {
            getExtensionClasses(); // load classes
            ...
            if (!clazz.isAnnotationPresent(Adaptive.class)) {
                ...
                cachedNames.put(clazz, name);
                cachedClasses.get().put(name, clazz);
            } 
             ...
        }
  2. 
I wan't to load xXXFilter when dubbo init，when call this method ,
ExtensionLoader#cachedActivates will load system extension，but xXXFilter I
call this method manually don't load in ExtensionLoader#cachedActivates.This
will lead ExtensionLoader#getActivateExtension() don't have xXXFilter.  
Did I use it incorrectly?  
Did I misunderstood the purpose of this method?
