instance, if an HTTPS web page would include a JavaScript file
from an HTTP endpoint, a MitM attacker could still manipulate its
contents and thus execute arbitrary JavaScript on the website.

icance of the test scores (*: p elements, with the value set to the hash of the expected
content of the included script. This script is only executed when the
integrity check passes, i.e. the hash of the actual content matches
the provided hash value.
B EVALUATION OF SECURITY INDICATORS:
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
In Table 2, we summarize the numerical results of our statistical
analysis from Section 3, for the various weaknesses and mitigation
techniques that we considered.
Furthermore, when not all pages of a website are loaded over
HTTPS, an attacker could set up an SSL-stripping attack: the MitM
attacker sets up a secure connection with the server, and replaces all
references of https:// with http://. As such, the server is led to
believe that a secure channel is used, and the victim is led to believe
that the server does not support HTTPS. A exemplary instance of
this is when the website serves all pages over HTTP, but references
the login form with HTTPS, as the login-action would contain the
user’s password. Nevertheless, the attacker can simply perform an
SSL-stripping attack and still obtain the user’s password.
There exists several other mechanisms that can further enhance
the secure connection between a client and the web server. For
instance, the Strict-Transport-Security mechanism indicates
to the browser that this website should only be contacted over
a secure channel for a given time; this eliminates the aforemen-
tioned SSL-stripping attacks. Similarly, the Public-Key-Pinning
response header can be used to indicate that the browser should
associate only the specified public keys with the web server. When
used incorrectly, this mechanism could effectively lock out users
from a website, so it requires a significant effort to set up properly.
Finally, to ensure certain cookies are only sent over secure channels,
the Secure attribute could be set.
A.6 Including untrusted content
One of the aspects that allows the web to thrive is that web pages
are allowed to include content from any other location. As web-
sites massively include content hosted or provided by third parties,
this brings along a variety of security-related issues. For instance,
Nikiforakis et al. showed that in many cases web developers in-
cluded JavaScript files from a domain that later became available
