### Table 7: Arrow Joint IP/Optical TE Formulation

- **Noise Sources and Reconfiguration**: The process begins by reconfiguring noise sources, followed by the reconfiguration of all intermediate ROADMs and noise sources.

- **Number of ROADMs to be Reconfigured**: Wavelengths from the cut fiber path are reconfigured to the surrogate restoration fiber.

### Path Reconfiguration

- **Reconfiguration Requirements**: Reconfiguring a path requires the ROADMs and ASE noise sources (at both add/drop nodes and intermediate nodes) to be reconfigured.
- **Quantification**: We quantify the number of devices to be reconfigured with Arrow for every fiber on Facebook‚Äôs optical backbone.
- **CDF Analysis**: Figure 19 shows the CDF of the number of add/drop and intermediate ROADMs to be reconfigured with Arrow at Facebook. For 80% of the fiber cut events, the number of add/drop ROADMs is less than 10, while the number for intermediate ROADMs is less than 6.
- **Reasoning**: The presence of more than 2 Add/drop ROADMs is due to the fact that failed wavelengths on a cut fiber do not necessarily originate and terminate at the endpoints of the broken fiber. Their source and destination sites could be any other ROADM sites on the optical layer.

### A.7 Wavelength Reconfiguration in Legacy Optical Layer is Slow

- **Challenges**: Wavelength reconfiguration is non-trivial due to the complex relationship between amplifiers‚Äô gain control mechanism and the wavelengths traversing the fiber. Sudden changes can result in unpredictable power fluctuations, leading to packet loss/errors in the IP layer.
- **Current Practice**: Current device manufacturers and backbone operators use a conservative stabilization process with multiple observe-analyze-act control loops, which takes several minutes per amplifier.
- **Case Study**: Figure 20 shows the time taken to reconfigure four wavelengths on a 2,000 km fiber path with 24 cascaded amplifier sites between Canada and US, taking 14 minutes using legacy hardware without noise loading.
- **Impact**: Slow wavelength reconfiguration is common in production, but it is essential. Figure 21 shows the number of monthly deployed wavelengths from November 2019 to April 2021 in Facebook, indicating an increase during the COVID-19 period.

### A.8 IP-to-Optical Topology Mapping

- **Topology Density**: In large-scale WANs, the IP-layer topology tends to be denser than the optical-layer topology.
- **CDF Analysis**: Figure 22 shows the CDF of the number of IP links per fiber and the number of wavelengths per IP link in Facebook, guiding the generation of IP-layer topologies for B4, IBM, and Facebook.

### A.9 Prior Work Comparison

- **TE-based Solutions**: Require pre-allocation of router ports and transponders, making them idle during fiber cuts.
- **OTN-based Solutions**: Save on router ports but still require an extra optical transponder.
- **Optical Restoration**: Dynamically shift wavelengths from the cut fiber onto healthy surrogate fibers, leveraging ROADMs. This approach does not leave router ports or transponders idle during fiber cuts.
- **Arrow's Advantages**: 
  - Considers multiple partial restoration candidates for optimizing IP-layer network throughput.
  - Achieves an end-to-end failover latency of eight seconds using noise loading, bypassing the reconfiguration time.

### A.10 Extensions

- **Support for Next-Generation C+L Optical Systems**: Arrow can be extended to support the L-band, thanks to the efficient abstraction of LotteryTickets and the noise loading technique.
- **Commercial Availability**: Recent advancements in L-band tunable transponders and reconfigurable WSS make it feasible to extend Arrow to the L-band, supporting future WANs.
