User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Netcat, Syslog, UDP, and Listening with netcat on UDP 514 to syslog data I see that each sent log message is separated by &lt;134&gt;.

Does anyone note what &lt;134> is?

Assistant: That is part of the header. "The Priority value is calculated by first multiplying the Facility number by 8 and then adding the numerical value of the Severity." So 134 / 8 = 16 (facility local0) remainder 6 (severity Informational: informational messages).

SYSLOG-MSG      = HEADER SP STRUCTURED-DATA [SP MSG]
HEADER          = PRI...
PRI             = "&lt;" PRIVAL "&gt;"
PRIVAL          = 1*3DIGIT ; range 0 .. 191
