### Issue Description

I am currently deploying a project to Heroku, which appears to copy the project from its build directory before starting it. This process is causing issues with Next.js version `5.0.0`, as it seems to output absolute paths. This can be confirmed by examining the source code. This issue was not present in version `4.2.3`.

- I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior

Given that Heroku's default behavior (which I'm not sure can be controlled) is to build the project in one directory and run the build in another, I would expect the build to not contain any absolute paths.

### Current Behavior

I have observed that absolute paths are being generated in the build, for example, in `dist/bundles/pages/_document.js`. 

An example of an error (not in the test repository) is:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/tmp/build_/eweilow-nextjs-deploy-test-/node_modules/next/dist/pages/_document.js'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:555:15)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:482:25)
    at Module.require (module.js:604:17)
    at require (internal/module.js:11:18)
    at Object.6 (/app/.next/dist/bundles/pages/_document.js:86:18)
    at __webpack_require__ (/app/.next/dist/bundles/pages/_document.js:23:31)
    at Object.5 (/app/.next/dist/bundles/pages/_document.js:78:18)
    at __webpack_require__ (/app/.next/dist/bundles/pages/_document.js:23:31)

    at Object. (/app/.next/dist/bundles/pages/_document.js:73:10)
code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Deploy the project from [this repository](https://github.com/eweilow/nextjs-deploy-test) to Heroku using their default configuration. The deployment will fail.

### Environment

- **Next.js**: 5.0.0
- **Node.js**: 9.x
- **OS**: Ubuntu 16.04 on Heroku
- **Browser**: Not relevant
