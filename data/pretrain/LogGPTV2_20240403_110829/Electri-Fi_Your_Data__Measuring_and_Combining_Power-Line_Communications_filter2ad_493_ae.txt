### Test with Probing Pause

We conducted a test in which we reset the devices at the beginning. After 2300 seconds, we paused the probing for approximately 7 minutes. Figure 17 presents the results of the experiments for various links. The findings indicate that the devices maintain their channel-estimation statistics, as the estimated capacity resumes from the previous value before the probing process was stopped. Therefore, the convergence time of the capacity estimation does not apply under realistic probing conditions.

**Figure 17: Estimated Capacity for Various Links**
- **Probing Rate:** 20 packets per second
- **Pause Duration:** 7 minutes after 2300 seconds
- **Observation:** The estimated capacity resumes from the previous value, indicating that the channel-estimation statistics are maintained.

### Conclusion on Capacity Estimation

Capacity should be estimated by sending probe packets and measuring Bit Loading Efficiency (BLE) in Power Line Communication (PLC) networks. Based on our study in Section 6.1, we need to consider the invariance scale and compute the average BLE (i.e., \( \text{BLE} = \frac{\sum_{s=1}^{6} \text{BLE}_s}{6} \)) by capturing PLC frames or requesting it using Management Messages (MMs). One of the remaining challenges in link-metric estimation is accounting for technology-specific MAC mechanisms, such as frame aggregation. This challenge also applies to the latest WiFi technologies, as highlighted in [16].

### 7.2 Size of Probe Packets

We investigated the size of probe packets. For the special case of sending 1 probe-packet per second with a size less than one Physical Block (PB), the estimation might converge to a smaller value than the true one for HomePlug AV (HPAV) and remain constant over time, independent of channel conditions. A representative example is shown in Figure 18, where HPAV capacity converges to approximately 89 Mbps when sending only 1 packet per second with a size less than one physical block (520B including an 8B PB header). After this convergence, the estimated capacity remains constant.

**Figure 18: Estimated Capacity with 1 Probe Packet per Second**
- **Packet Sizes:** 1300B, 200B, 521B, 520B
- **Observation:** The estimated capacity converges to approximately 89 Mbps when sending 1 packet per second with a size less than one PB.

A simple computation shows that the rate required to transmit one PB in one OFDM symbol is \( R_{\text{1sym}} = \frac{(520 \times 8)}{T_{\text{sym}}} \approx 89.4 \text{Mbps} \) with HPAV, given the symbol duration \( T_{\text{sym}} = 40.96 \mu s \). When sending packets smaller than one PB, the rate converges to \( R_{\text{1sym}} \) for all 6 slots of the mains cycle because increasing the rate does not reduce the transmission time (it is not possible to transmit less than 1 OFDM symbol) while decreasing the probability of error (higher rates yield less robust modulation schemes).

Thus, to estimate the capacity of a link by sending only one probe packet per second, it is crucial to send packets larger than 1 PB or 1 OFDM symbol.

### 7.3 Frequency of Probe Packets

We explored the trade-off between accuracy and overhead in probing for capacity estimation. We used the measurements from Section 6.2 and assumed that any link is probed at a specific interval, which is:
1. The same for all links.
2. Dependent on link quality.

We employed the BLE measured at these intervals as an estimation of the capacity and considered the exact capacity as the average values of BLE until the next probe. Let \( t \) be an estimation instant and \( i \) the probing interval in multiples of 50ms (period of measurements). The estimation is \( \text{BLE}_t \), and the exact capacity is \( \text{BLE}_e(t) = \frac{\sum_{l=t}^{t+i-1} \text{BLE}_l}{i} \). The estimation error is computed as the absolute value of the difference between the estimation and the exact capacity, i.e., \( |\text{BLE}_t - \text{BLE}_e(t)| \).

Our network consists of at least 10 stations. To achieve low overhead, we assume that stations send at most 1 probe packet per 5 seconds (yielding a 240Kbps probing overhead if 1500B probes are used), and we adopt this interval as a baseline. We also explore probing at lower frequencies, such as once per 80 seconds. The method that uses our temporal variation study probes bad links once per 5 seconds, average links 8 times slower, and good links 16 times slower (once per 80 seconds). To classify the quality of the links, we use heuristics based on our study in Section 6.2: bad links have a BLE below 60Mbps, good links have a BLE above 100 Mbps, and average links have a BLE in between.

**Figure 19: Comparison of Estimation Error for Different Probing Frequencies**
- **CDF of Estimation Error**
- **Methods Compared:** Our method, Probing per 5 sec., Probing per 80 sec.
- **Observation:** Our method reduces the probing overhead by 32% compared to probing all links once per 5 seconds, while maintaining very good accuracy.

These results suggest that by studying the PLC network and its temporal variation, probing can be optimized to achieve a good trade-off between overhead and accuracy. To estimate an appropriate probing interval based on the network size and the aggregate link quality, the Central Coordinator (CCo) of the network can employ the information on the quality of all the links and update the interval value by broadcasting to all stations.

### 7.4 Bandwidth Aggregation Using Capacity

To further validate our capacity estimation method, we implemented a simple load-balancing algorithm that aggregates bandwidth between WiFi and PLC and operates between the IP and MAC layers. We used the Click Modular Router [10] to forward each IP packet to one of the mediums with a probability proportional to the capacity of the medium. At the destination, we reordered the packets according to a simple algorithm that checks the identification sequence of the IP header. We measured the jitter and compared it with the jitter when using only one interface, ensuring that it does not worsen.

**Figure 20: Performance Boost by Using Hybrid WiFi/PLC**
- **Throughput Comparison:** Hybrid, Round-robin, PLC, WiFi
- **Observation:** By using simple load-balancing and reordering algorithms, and our capacity-estimation technique, we achieved a throughput very close to the sum of the capacities of both mediums. In contrast, the round-robin scheduler, which has no information on capacity, is limited to twice the minimum capacity of the two mediums.

Our tests validate our capacity estimation methods. They also show that, to exploit each medium to the fullest extent, accurate link-quality metrics are required. However, an open question remains: How should the link metrics be updated to take into account delay or contention? In the next section, we investigate another link metric, i.e., the expected number of retransmissions, and the performance of link metrics with respect to background traffic.

### 8. Retransmitting in PLC Channels

Capacity is a good metric for link quality but does not account for interference, which is crucial for selecting links with high available bandwidth. Another metric, such as the Expected Transmission Count (ETX), could be useful for delay-sensitive applications that do not saturate the medium but have low delay requirements. Delay is affected by retransmissions due to bursty errors or contention, and metrics like P_Berr (introduced in Section 5) are related to retransmissions.

**8.1 Retransmission Due to Errors**

We explored how ETX would perform in PLC by sending broadcast packets. Because broadcast packets in PLC are transmitted with the most robust modulation and are acknowledged by some proxy station [6], we expect that this method yields very low loss rates.

For this study, we set each station in turn to broadcast 1500B probe-packets (1 every 100ms) for 500 seconds. The rest of the stations counted the missed packets using an identification in our packet header. We repeated the test for all stations of the testbed during night and working hours (day).

**Figure 21: Loss Rate of Broadcast Packets in PLC**
- **Loss Rate vs. Throughput and P_Berr**
- **Observation:**
  1. A wide range of links with diverse qualities have very low loss rates (∼ 10−4), and some links even have 0 loss rates. High loss rates (e.g., larger than 10−1) can classify bad links, but low loss rates provide no meaningful information about link quality.
  2. There is no significant difference between experiments during the day and night. A few bad links have worse loss rates during the day, but some average links yield much lower loss rates.
  3. As PLC adapts the modulation scheme to channel conditions when data is transmitted, broadcast packets sent at the most robust modulation scheme cannot reflect the real link quality. Given the low loss rates of a wide range of links, ETX appears to be 0 at short-time scales, providing no or misleading information on link quality.

In conclusion, the loss rate of broadcast packets in PLC is a very noisy metric for assessing link quality.
