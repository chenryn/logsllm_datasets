Abstract—Secure distance measurement and therefore secure
Time-of-Arrival (ToA) measurement is critical for applications
such as contactless payments, passive-keyless entry and start
systems, and navigation systems. This paper initiates the study
of Message Time of Arrival Codes (MTACs) and their security.
MTACs represent a core primitive in the construction of
systems for secure ToA measurement. By surfacing MTACs in
this way, we are able for the ﬁrst time to formally deﬁne the
security requirements of physical-layer measures that protect
ToA measurement systems against attacks. Our viewpoint also
enables us to provide a uniﬁed presentation of existing MTACs
(such as those proposed in distance-bounding protocols and in a
secure distance measurement standard) and to propose basic
principles for protecting ToA measurement systems against
attacks that remain unaddressed by existing mechanisms. We
also use our perspective to systematically explore the tradeoffs
between security and performance that apply to all signal
modulation techniques enabling ToA measurements.
1. Introduction
When did the message arrive at the receiver? Can this
estimate of the message arrival time be manipulated, and in
particular by an attacker that controls the communication
channel? In particular, can message advancement and delay
attacks be prevented? This question is at the core of the
problem that distance bounding protocols, secure positioning,
and navigation systems are trying to solve: can we prevent
the attacker from reducing or enlarging the distance that is
measured between the devices? This problem is relevant in
a number of application scenarios: contactless payments [1],
Passive Keyless Entry and Start Systems [2]–[5], GNSS (e.g.,
Galileo, GPS) security [6]–[8]. If we could prevent Time of
Arrival (ToA) and therefore distance manipulation attacks,
we could enable many proximity-based applications, from
location-based access control to secure navigation [9], [10].
As a result, many distance bounding protocols have
been proposed and analyzed [11]–[13]. Implementations of
distance bounding protocols have emerged that combine such
protocols with distance measurement techniques [14]–[17],
in particular with UWB 802.15.4 radios [18]–[20].
The main idea behind these solutions is to prevent ToA
manipulation by the randomization of message content.
Namely, it was commonly believed that if the attacker
cannot predict the bits of the messages, then he will not
be able to advance their time of arrival at the receiver.
In [21] the authors argued this to be false – since bits are
encoded into symbols, attackers can advance their arrival
time. Different physical-layer attacks followed also validating
this in practice [3], [22], [23]. This led to the conclusion that
secure distance measurement systems can only be built with
short symbols and using rapid bit exchange [21]. Given the
limits on the output power, such a result would mean that only
short-range systems could be made secure. This was shown
to be incorrect in [24], which showed that longer symbols can
be used if they are interleaved in transmission in a manner
that is unpredictable to the attacker. This further demonstrated
that secure, long-range distance measurement systems are
possible. Recent works further show that, under certain
conditions, distance enlargement can also be detected [25].
All these works showed that consideration of the details
of how bits are encoded into symbols (i.e., modulation) is
crucial in the design of secure distance measurement systems.
This discussion leads to the following questions:
Can we construct a generic message to symbol encoding
that prevents any message advancement/reduction (and there-
fore distance delay/enlargement) for symbols of arbitrary
lengths (and therefore arbitrary measurement ranges)?
Can we derive the main principles for the design of such
encodings?
In this work, we show that answering these questions
is indeed possible. To do so, we introduce Message Time
Of Arrival Codes (MTACs), a new class of cryptographic
primitive that allows receivers to verify if an adversary has
manipulated the message arrival time. In a similar way that
Message Authentication Codes protect message integrity,
MTACs preserve the integrity of message arrival times. They
are, therefore, fundamental to any protocol that relies on Time
of Arrival information, such as clock synchronization [26],
distance measurement [27] and positioning protocols [28]–
[31].
In the same sense that bits can be encrypted with a
shared key, the shape of a signal can also be hidden by
masking it with a random fast-changing sequence. However,
to verify a signal shape, a receiver has to aggregate the signal
over a considerable time interval in order to capture enough
energy. This is especially so when sender and receiver are
separated by longer distances. If the attacker knows the
temporal alignment of those aggregations with the signal,
he can hide his guessing errors in the null space of the
(linear) aggregation function. Simple signal masking is,
therefore, not sufﬁcient for the protection against distance
manipulation attacks. To address this problem, in addition
to using cryptographically-secured modulation (i.e., signal
generation), an MTAC also performs cryptographic checks
of the consistency of the modulation at the receiver.
We give a formal deﬁnition of MTACs and their security.
We provide the main principles for the design of these
codes. We review existing secure distance measurement
schemes and draft standards and show how they ﬁt within our
MTAC deﬁnitions. We then introduce a new Variance-Based
MTAC that is inspired by our design principles. We show
that adhering to these principles allows protection against
physical-layer distance-reducing attacks over a wide, realistic
performance region. We systematically explore the trade-off
between performance and security in ranging.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we introduce physical-layer attacks against distance
measurement. Section 3 then contains the formal security
deﬁnitions. Section 4 explores attack strategies. In Section 5,
we go over existing proposals. After that, we propose a
Variance-Based MTAC in Section 6, which we underline
with simulations in Section 7. We conclude in Section 8.
2. Background: Secure Distance Measurement
In this section, we introduce different RF techniques for
distance measurement and highlight the challenges towards
securing such systems against physical-layer attacks.
2.1. Distance Measurement Techniques and Stan-
dards
Establishing location or proximity both require estimating
the physical distance between two or more wireless entities.
Numerous wireless ranging and localization techniques have
emerged in the last decade. Some of these observe physical
properties of the signal such as RSSI [32] or phase [33] that
change as a function of propagation. However, both these
properties can be controlled by an attacker that relays the
signal and modiﬁes them to ﬁt another distance claim [34],
[35]. The only signal property that cannot be reliably
controlled by an attacker is its time-of-ﬂight (ToF). More
precisely, an attacker cannot reduce ToF, as a signal cannot
traverse space faster than the speed of light.
For ToF measurements, ultra-wideband impulse radio
(UWB-IR) has emerged as a prominent technique for precise
ranging. It allows high operating distances despite power con-
straints by transmitting multi-pulse symbols. UWB-IR rang-
ing is in the process of being standardized in IEEE 802.15.4z
and is becoming commercially available [18]–[20].
2.2. Distance-Bounding Protocols
Distance-bounding protocols that rely on ToF measure-
ments, as provided by UWB-IR, are the cornerstone for
Figure 1. While distance-bounding protocols may be considered secure at
the bit-level, systems can still be vulnerable at the physical layer. Distance-
bounding protocols that rely on performant (i.e., long-distance), deterministic
modulations are vulnerable to ED/LC attacks, as shown in the lower part of
the ﬁgure. The underlying cause is time-redundant encoding for performance.
secure proximity veriﬁcation and positioning. As shown
in Figure 1, the basic idea behind such applications is as
follows: a prover ﬁrst commits to a cryptographic nonce;
when triggered by receipt of a challenge message from
the veriﬁer, the prover sends the nonce, and then sends an
opening of its commitment; veriﬁcation is deemed successful
if the commitment opens correctly to the nonce obtained
at the veriﬁer. ToF is bounded at the veriﬁer by the time
difference between sending the trigger signal and it starting
to receive the nonce.
Existing vulnerabilities are related to the time-critical
aspects of such a protocol, namely adjudging exactly when
the nonce starts to be received at the veriﬁer. This is relevant
even when secret-dependent masked waveforms are used.
It is therefore essential that both the secret information
content and its time of arrival are carefully tested. Earlier
instantiations of distance-bounding protocols relied on a
rapid bit-exchange [16] to check both the content and timing
of each bit of the nonce in consecutive rounds. As this
requires each symbol to be short, this does not scale to
longer distances. A distance commitment [16] can be used to
decouple time acquisition from content veriﬁcation. However,
there are still doubts about the security level of the content
veriﬁcation, due to targeted attacks on the modulation [21].
2.3. Physical-Layer Attacks
Physical-layer attacks that target the underlying mod-
ulation cannot be addressed solely by distance-bounding
protocols. In the following, we do not consider attacks that
can be averted by conservative signal acquisition (Cicada
attack [36]) or involve denial of service (overshadowing,
jamming). Instead, we address distance manipulation attacks
that exploit redundancies in the modulation, and that are
not easily averted by security-aware conﬁguration choices
of existing receivers.

reduces the distance measured by preemptively injecting
a non-committal waveform that triggers an early signal
detection at the receiver [21], [22]. The goal is to cause
the receiver to register an earlier time of arrival, which,
however, the attacker cannot back with knowledge about
actual signal content. We illustrate this attack in the lower
part of Figure 1. The attacker gets away with this attack due
to non-idealities of the legitimate receiver, requiring it to
integrate signal power over time for each bit-wise decision,
effectively limiting its resolution. To compensate for early
deviations from the legitimate symbol (i.e., guessing errors),
the attacker signiﬁcantly ampliﬁes his signal towards the end
of each symbol. For maximum effect (distance reduction),
the attacker sends the committal, information-bearing part as
late as possible after the start of the injected signal. Ideally,
this is done to precisely coincide with the start time of the
legitimate signal so that the attacker can “copy” it’s content
(with ampliﬁcation). An ED/LC attack can be executed fully
deterministically and can lead to a distance reduction up to
the product of the symbol duration and the speed of light.
Guessing attacks. If the polarity of individual pulses making
up a modulated symbol does not only depend on the bit-value
of the symbol, e.g., by being fully randomized as in [24],
the attacker can resort to a probabilistic ED/LC attack, i.e.,
a guessing attack. Here, the attacker tries to guess signal
components in advance in order to reduce the measured
distance. As in an ED/LC attack, the attacker exploits signal
redundancies that are required for robust signal reception. The
basic idea is that the attacker can compensate early guessing
errors by using more power towards the end of the symbol.
For each symbol, the attacker can, for instance, double the
power as long as his guesses are wrong and stop interfering
as soon as a pulse is guessed correctly. This power-increase
attack is discussed in more detail in Section 4.
2.4. Secure Distance Measurement Solutions
There has been a proposal addressing the outlined threats
by cryptographically hiding the bit-wise aggregations in a
UWB-based On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation [24]. The
authors provide concrete security levels for selected attacker
models. A second approach is to correlate an incoming
signal, a so-called Scrambled Timestamp Sequence (STS),
with the expected signal shape and locking to the peak [37].
To the best of our knowledge, there exists no estimate of the
concrete security offered by the latter method. In contrast
to both proposals, our work establishes the security goal of
any such approach on a fundamental level and outlines a
solution permitting to a more general attacker and a broader
performance region. We come back to the relation between
our work and these existing schemes in Section 5.

the receiver to verify the message time of arrival securely.
Such codes preserve the legitimate signal time of arrival
under an adversary that tries to “shift” the signal in time,
i.e., aim to create the impression of a different arrival
time. Fundamentally, the adversarial behavior can be either
directed towards producing the code at a time earlier than its
legitimate appearance (advancement) or to erase any evidence
of a signal, thus opening the possibility for a late imitation
(delay). In the following deﬁnitions, we divide the problem
along those two threats. Although we provide deﬁnitions for
both threats, we focus on their use in preventing message
advancement (i.e., distance reduction) attacks. Preventing
such attacks is necessary for the security of all secure distance
measurement systems. A system performing secure time of
arrival measurement might in practice use separate codes to
protect against advancement and delay attacks.
Prior to the deﬁnitions, we brieﬂy go over boundary
conditions on our proposal, stemming from requirements on
precision and performance of wireless ranging signals.
3.1. System and Attacker Model
We can model any ranging signal as consisting of
short-time signal contributions (i.e., pulses) that carry the
information used for precise ranging. As shown in Figure 2,
linear combinations of these pulses provide the statistics for
the detection of information bits at the receiver. This model
covers a broad range of modulation schemes.
Modulation. In the following, we state some assumptions
on the modulation. Following Kerckhoffs’ principle, we
assume the attacker to be aware of all of these aspects
of the modulation.
• The modulation consists of a series of elementary,
short-time signal contributions called pulses. The
effect of ED/LC attacks on such individual signal
contributions is considered insigniﬁcant (say, less
than 1m) in a sufﬁciently wideband system. We refer
to the amplitude level of such a pulse as a sample.
For performance-related considerations, we assume
the pulses to be sufﬁciently spaced such that there
is no inter-pulse-interference in the given channel.
•
• Each information bit is encoded in a symbol con-
sisting of nppb pulses (and samples). The value
b1b2tttof nppb is chosen in compliance with a target
performance level p within a performance region
P = [0, BERmax] × [0, dmax] × [0, Γmax], deﬁned
by intervals bounded by the maximally tolerated bit
error rate BERmax, the maximum communication
distance dmax as well as the maximum NLoS signal
attenuation Γmax.
• Bits are grouped together to form frames, and each
frame consists of np pulses (and hence np/nppb bits).
Receiver Demodulation. We assume the receiver demodu-
lates by aggregating nppb samples using correlation with
a polarity1 mask that ﬁts the corresponding hypothesis
for each possible value of the information bit. Then, a
binary hypothesis test is applied to recover each bit. This
is illustrated in Figure 2. We assume an AWGN2 channel
model without inter-pulse interference. In general, the bit
error rate (BER) at the receiver is therefore given by the tail
bound on the Gaussian distribution, i.e.
BER = Q s nppbPrx
n ! ,
σ2

under Gaussian thermal noise with variance σ2
n = bW · N0,
where N0 is the noise power spectral density at room
temperature, bW is the system bandwidth and Prx is the
receiver-side signal power. Figure 2 highlights the effect of
larger nppb (longer symbols) on BER. This is to highlight
the beneﬁcial effect of temporal diversity on performance.
Although Equation 1 refers to a BSPK modulation, this effect
extends to other modulation techniques. We note that, within
this model, for any channel and target BER, there exists
an adequate symbol length and assume that the receiver
chooses the symbol length accordingly. In this work, we do
not assume any (error-correcting) coding.
Attacker Model. We assume that the attacker fully controls
the communication channel and has no limitations on how
fast she can process messages and react to them. She is,
therefore, able to detect individual samples ideally. As a
consequence, the attacker’s information advantage increases
as the channel for legitimate communication worsens, e.g.,
due to increased distance. We consider two distinct attack
models capturing distance reduction (message advancement)
and distance enlargement (message delay). In the case of
the distance reduction attacker, we pose no restriction on
the attacker’s abilities regarding the speed of computation,3
location, or control of the communication channel (e.g., we
give the attacker the ability to record and reactively inject
messages on the channel with negligible delay). The only
restriction that we pose is that the attacker cannot transmit
information faster than the speed of light. The attacker’s
sampling rate needs to be sufﬁcient to recover the signal.

3. Although MTACs can be constructed so as to be information-
theoretically secure, most practical schemes will require that the attacker is
computationally restricted.
Figure 3. Ideal instantiations of distance reduction (left) and distance
enlargement (right) attacks. Both attacks are less likely to be detected
the better an attacker can guess the legitimate signal shape. This holds both
for releasing an early version (reduction) and for covertly annihilating the
valid signal (enlargement).
For an attack to be effective, we don’t need to assume that
the attacker has a higher bandwidth since we assume the
attacker can precisely synchronize to the start of the signal.
For the distance enlargement attacker, we assume that the
attacker is constrained in terms of location, computation and
control of the environment such that she is only able to block
the reception of samples if she can anticipate their polarity.
However, this includes attackers that operate with multiple
(smart) antennas or increase noise levels at the legitimate
receiver
Visualising Attacks. In Figure 3, we illustrate ideal in-
stantiations of distance modiﬁcation attacks. Testing for a
distance reduction attack at the receiver consists of a single
hypothesis test: either the signal is real (i.e., only distorted
by channel) or it is attacker-generated (i.e., it is distorted in a
way that indicates that many pulses were guessed wrongly).
An attacker is successful if he can produce the expected
signal earlier. Verifying existence or absence of a distance
enlargement attack, however, involves a multi-hypothesis test
in time: the receiver has to check whether a given version
of the signal is the ﬁrst occurrence of its kind or if there
exists an earlier, potentially degraded, version sufﬁciently
similar to the legitimate signal. Consequently, in both attacks,
an attacker’s success chances are higher the better he can
anticipate the legitimate signal shape.
3.2. Deﬁnitions
A Message Time of Arrival Code (MTAC) is intended
to allow detection of any kind of physical-layer distance-
modifying attack with high likelihood.
Deﬁnition 1 A message time of arrival code (MTAC) is
a tuple of probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms (Gen,
Mtac, Vrfy), such that:

3)
The key-generation algorithm Gen takes as input
the security parameter n and outputs a key k with
|k| = n.
The code-generation algorithm Mtac takes as input
a key k and a message m ∈ {0, 1}nb and outputs
a real-valued vector c = (c1, . . . , cnp ). Since this
algorithm may be randomized, we write this as
