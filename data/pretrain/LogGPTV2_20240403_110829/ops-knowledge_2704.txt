User: I'm checking to see if a directory exists, but I noticed I'm using os.path.exists instead of os.path.isdir.  Both work just fine, but I'm curious as to what the advantages are for using isdir instead of exists.
Assistant: Just like it sounds like: if the path exists, but is a file and not a directory, isdir will return False. Meanwhile, exists will return True in both cases.
