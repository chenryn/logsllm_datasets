quest comes from the market place, where the original request was purchased and resold
by many intermediaries. In that case, the referrer is the last entity that sold the ad inventory
to the ad exchange. Ad exchanges do not have visibility of the user-side publisher if the
request comes from the market place. This is one of the challenges for ad exchanges to
detect and stop fraud.
4.3 Datasets
In this section, we describe the datasets we obtained including Demand Side Platform
provider (DSP) trafﬁc, public blacklist data, and malware domain data. Table 4.1 provides

a brief summary of the datasets.
4.3.1 DSP Trafﬁc
The DSP provides ad bidding logs extracted from step 3 of Figure 4.1. The trafﬁc is ag-
gregated into eight ﬁelds per hour every day: the ad exchange that issued the bid request,
the publisher domain name of the referrer URL, the hashed IP address of the user, the
country code and autonomous system number of the IP address, the hourly timestamp
of when the bid request was sent, and lastly the number of bid requests seen within the
speciﬁc hour that match all the previous ﬁelds. Within the ﬁelds, the publisher domain
name represents either the webpage that users saw, or the last trafﬁc reseller before the bid
request reached the ad exchange. Next, we describe DSP trafﬁc using the volume of bid
requests and publisher domain names.
Bid Request Volume
It is reasonable to assume that for each bid request, some advertiser wins the bid eventually.
Therefore, the bid request volume can be considered to be the number of ad inventories
purchased and shufﬂed through the ad exchanges from the visibility of the DSP.
Figure 4.2 shows the bid request volume from six different ad exchanges from 12/10/2014
to 3/24/2015. One of these ad exchanges is ranked top ﬁve in market share. On average,
there are 3.45 billion bid requests daily in total. Individually, Exchange A processed the
most bid requests of all, with an average of 1.77 billion requests per day. Exchange B

comes next, with an average of 695 million requests per day. In addition, Exchange E,
Exchange F, and Exchange C received bid requests on the order of hundreds of millions.
Finally, Exchange D had an average of 30 million bid requests daily, which ﬂuctuated the
most compared to other ad exchanges.
Comparing the volume of the last day from the DSP trafﬁc (3/24/2015) with that of the
ﬁrst day (12/10/2014), there is a decline in the overall bid request volume from Exchange
A (63.2%), Exchange B (34.3%), Exchange C (83.2%), and Exchange D (31.2%). How-
ever, the volume increased for Exchange E (18.34%) and Exchange F (64.26%). Our DSP
conﬁrmed that this was not a trafﬁc collection problem but could not identify the root cause
of these changes.
Publisher Domains
The publisher domain ﬁeld in the DSP trafﬁc indicates the source of an ad request. It is
either the publisher website where the ad will be shown, or the reseller domain redirected
from some previous publisher.
An average of 391,430 total publisher domains were seen from all ad exchanges every
day. Figure 4.3 shows the number of unique publisher domains from each ad exchange.
Although Exchange A had the highest number of bid requests (Figure 4.2), it represented
the lowest number of unique domains (average: 955) per day. It is likely that many of them
are trafﬁc resellers. For instance, coxdigitalsolutions.com is a subsidiary of Cox
specializing in buying and selling digital media. It is the most popular publisher domain

The small set of publisher
domains of Exchange A is quite stable. There were no new publishers in 39 days out of
three months, and an average of 91 new publisher domains on the other days. Exchange
D has the fewest bid requests and also had very few publisher domains, an average of
14,732 every day. If an ad exchange works with few publishers, it is easier to provision
them and block malicious trafﬁc. On the other hand, it is harder to know the source of ad
inventories from reseller publishers, meaning detection may need to happen at the reseller’s
perspective.
Two ad exchanges saw the largest number of new publisher domains. Exchange E had
an average of 22,647 new publisher domains, while Exchange F had an average of 23,405
new publisher domains daily. Towards the end of March 2015 in Figure 4.3, there were as
many as 35,794 new domains from Exchange E and 56,151 new domains from Exchange F.
Both ad exchanges also increased the volume of bid requests during the same time period
in Figure 4.2. The churn rates of the publisher domain names in these two ad exchanges
were quite high. This presents a challenge for ad exchanges to track the reputation of new
publishers.
Lastly, Exchange B had a stable number of publisher domains every day, on the order
of 100,000. There was a decrease in the number of daily publisher domains seen from
Exchange C around the end of 2014, and then the number increased again, reaching the
150,000 mark towards the end of March 2015.
4.3.2 Other Datasets
In order to measure reputation in the DSP bid request trafﬁc, we also obtained other datasets
that provide threat information, which includes public blacklists and dynamic malware
execution trafﬁc. Both provide insight into known abuse in the ad exchanges. We crawled
seven public blacklists [82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88] daily from 12/9/2009 to 1/15/2016. In
total, 1.92 million unique domains appeared on the public blacklists. Dynamic malware

execution feeds are from one university [89] and two industry partners. The binaries were
each executed for ﬁve minutes in a controlled environment. We extracted date, malware
md5, and the domain names queried during the execution of the binaries. The feeds are
collected from 1/1/2011 to 11/17/2015. There are 77.29 million unique malware md5s,
querying a total of 14.3 million domain names. We use PBL to denote the public blacklists
dataset and Md5 to denote the malware domains dataset.
Lastly, we collected DNS resolution data every day from a passive DNS repository
in North America between 12/10/2014 to 3/24/2015. The dataset contains domain name,
query type, and resolved data every day for A, NS, CNAME, and AAAA query types. We
observed a daily average of 891 million unique mappings between domain names. On
average, the DNS resolution dataset matches 71.56% of all publisher domain names seen
in the DSP in the same day. Among the 28.55% publisher domains from DSP not seen in
passive DNS, the majority of them are long tail content sites. For example, unpopular blog
sites, user’s own fantasy sport pages, customized lists pages, etc. Long tail content can be
speciﬁc to certain users’ interests and not commonly accessed across different networks.
In full disclosure, this is perhaps the only not fully open source intelligence source we used
in our experiments. However, commercial passive DNS offerings are very simple to obtain
today [90]. We will use the resolution information to construct infrastructure graphs and
track them over time in Section 4.6.

In this section we provide examples of blacklisted publisher domains that generated ad
bidding requests through the ad exchanges. These domains are from adware and afﬁliate
marketing programs.
4.4.1 Case 1: PUP
Blacklisted publisher domains can be generated by Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP)
such as browser hijacker and pop-up ads.
Figure 4.4 (1) shows domain names of pattern websearch.*.info that are used by
browser hijackers [91]. The adware forces the user to use a different search engine to steal
impressions that would have otherwise been delivered through typical search engines (e.g.,
Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.). The adware hijacks user search queries and makes ad bidding
requests from these publisher domains to generate revenue.
Figure 4.4 (2) shows “update” domains used by pop-up ads. The adware shows pop-
up ads that masquerade as fake updaters for legitimate software, such as Windows, Flash,
and video players [92]. These publisher domains make ad bidding requests from pop-up
windows generated by the adware.
4.4.2 Case 2: Afﬁliate Marketing
Blacklisted publisher domains may represent afﬁliate marketing domains. These afﬁliate
domains request ads through ad exchanges on behalf of adware or malware. We manually
analyzed network traces from dynamic execution of malware md5s that contained domains
in Figure 4.4 (3). The malware uses fake referrers to send HTTP GET requests through
domains in Figure 4.4 (3). Then the requests go through a chain of redirections until ﬁnally
receiving an ad to generate revenue.

4.5 Measurement
We ﬁrst discuss client IP location distribution in DSP trafﬁc in Section 4.5.2. Then, we
perform reputation analysis of publisher domains by correlating them with blacklists and
malware domains in Section 4.5.3.
4.5.1 Summary of Findings
In summary, we found that:
• There are 13,324 (0.27%) known malicious domains generating bid request trafﬁc
through the ad exchanges in our datasets. On average, they generate 1.8% of overall
bid requests daily, much less than previously published values [23, 24]. However,
68.28% of blacklisted domains were identiﬁed by public blacklists before they ap-
peared in DSP trafﬁc. This suggests traditional sources of maliciousness are valuable,
but insufﬁcient to understand ad-abuse from the perspective of DSPs.
• On average, blacklisted publisher domains tend to use more ad exchanges (aver-
age: 1.85) and reach more clients (average: 5109.47) compared to non-blacklisted
domains (average ad exchanges: 1.43, average hashed client IP addresses: 568.78)
(Section 4.5.3). This suggests reputation systems for ad publishers are possible.
• Contrary to the observation of blacklisted publisher domains, malware domains use a
similar number of ad exchanges (average: 1.44), but are seen from more hashed client
IP addresses (average: 2310.75), compared to publisher domains never queried by
malware (average ad exchanges: 1.43, average hashed client IP addresses: 485.36).
(Section 4.5.3)
4.5.2 Client Analysis
We observed 436 million hashed client IPs that sent bid requests for ads. According to
information provided by the DSP, the hashed client IP addresses are from 37,865 different

Table 4.2a shows the top six countries where hashed client IP addresses reside. Nearly
40% of clients are located in the United States. Next, it is the United Kingdom with 8% of
hashed IP addresses. The top six countries also include Germany (7.11%), Canada (4.82%),
France (3.90%), and Mexico (2.98%). There is a long tail of 228 other countries for the
remaining clients. Overall the top six countries account for 66.75% of all the hashed client
IP addresses seen in DSP. Figure 4.5 shows the country distribution of hashed client IP
address locations.
Table 4.2b presents the top six Autonomous System Names (ASNs) for hashed client
IP addresses. The ASN distribution is less biased compared to the country distribution.
Comcast, AT&T, and Deutsche Telekom are the top three ASNs, each with under 5% of all

which contains 82.34% of all hashed IPs.
4.5.3 Reputation Analysis
In this section, we explain how we intersect publisher domains from DSP trafﬁc with black-
lists and malware domains to perform reputation analysis.
Public Blacklist Trafﬁc
Since 89.87% of the domains on the blacklists we collected do not have semantic informa-
tion, we ﬁlter them to ensure they are bad publishers with high conﬁdence. We want to be
conservative about what we keep, so we choose the following ﬁlters. First, we obtained
all the domains that appeared on the Alexa [93] top one million list for every day from
12/10/2014 to 3/24/2015. We excluded those consistent Alexa domains because they are
unlikely to be malicious. Second, we excluded all domains under the ad server category of
EasyList [94], because malware conducting impression fraud or click fraud can generate
trafﬁc that goes through ad servers. Lastly, we excluded a hand curated a whitelist of CDN
effective second level domains (e2lds) and we excluded all fully qualiﬁed domain names
that overlapped with these e2lds.
Observation 1: 0.27% publisher domains appeared in DSP trafﬁc were blacklisted
by the security community. They generated 1.8% of all bid requests daily.
We observed 4,905,224 unique domains in the DSP trafﬁc from 12/10/2014 to 3/24/2014.
Among them, 13,324 (0.27%) domains were blacklisted some time between 12/9/2009 and
1/15/2016. Blacklisted domains were responsible for an average of 1.8% of all bid requests
every day. Previous studies estimate nearly 30% of bid requests are malicious [23, 24],
which suggests this is only a fraction of the actual abuse. While there are many potential
causes, such as referrer spooﬁng or lack of ad-abuse investigations, these ﬁndings show
simply relying on blacklists from the security community is insufﬁcient to study and com-

bat abuse. While they are few, we investigated the potential to automatically detect these
abusive domains.
Observation 2: 68.28% of blacklisted publisher domains were known to the secu-
rity community before they appeared in DSP trafﬁc.
Figure 4.6a shows the density distribution for the difference of days between when a
domain was ﬁrst blacklisted and when it was seen in DSP trafﬁc. The zero value in this
case means that the domain name was blacklisted on the same day as it was seen in the
ad exchanges. Similarly, a value of -500 means that the domain was blacklisted 500 days
before it ever appeared in the datasets from the DSP. The plot shows that 68.28% (9,097) of
