User: Python have been really bumpy for me, because the last time I created a GUI client, the client seems to hang when spawning a process, calling a shell script, and calling outside application.
This have been my major problem with Python since then, and now I'm in a new project, can someone give me pointers, and a word of advice in order for my GUI python application to still be interactive when spawning another process?
Assistant: Your main GUI thread will freeze if you spawn off a process and wait for it to completely. Often, you can simply use subprocess and poll it now and then for completion rather than waiting for it to finish. This will keep your GUI from freezing.
