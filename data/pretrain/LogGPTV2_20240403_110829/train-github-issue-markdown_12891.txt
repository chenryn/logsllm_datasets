If you add multiple child elements to a ToolTip, you will receive the
following error:
**Invariant Violation**  
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a
class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely
forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The current error message is associated with forgetting to import a component,
making troubleshooting more difficult.
## Current Behavior
Either update the ToolTip component to allow multiple children, or throw a
more descriptive error.
