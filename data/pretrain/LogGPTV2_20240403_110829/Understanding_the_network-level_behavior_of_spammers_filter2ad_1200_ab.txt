### 2.1 Mail Relay Data Collection

To analyze spam, we collect two key pieces of information: (1) the username for which the email was intended and (2) network-level properties of the mail relay from which the spam originated. Specifically, the mail server gathers the following data when spam is received:

- **IP Address**: The IP address of the relay that established the SMTP connection to the sinkhole.
- **Traceroute**: A traceroute to the IP address to estimate the network location of the mail relay.
- **TCP Fingerprint**: A passive "p0f" TCP fingerprint based on the properties of the TCP stack, which helps determine the operating system of the mail relay.
- **DNS Blacklist (DNSBL) Lookups**: The results of DNSBL lookups for the mail relay at eight different DNSBLs.

These features are not easily forged, unlike many aspects of the SMTP header.

### 2.2 Legitimate Email Traces

One of our study's objectives was to compare the network-level characteristics of spam with those of legitimate emails. To achieve this, we obtained a corpus of mail logs from a large email provider using a Postfix mail server. This provider manages millions of mailboxes and performs extensive spam filtering at its incoming SMTP servers. The logs record, for each SMTP connection attempt, the time of the attempt, the IP address of the connecting host, whether the mail was accepted or rejected, and, if rejected, the reason for rejection. Using these logs, we can estimate the network-level properties of emails deemed legitimate by this domain.

Our analysis covered approximately 700,000 pieces of legitimate mail received on June 13, 2006. Although the legitimate mail corpus is from a different domain than our sinkhole, both sources provide large, representative samples of spam and legitimate mail that could be expected at any Internet domain.

### 2.3 Botnet Command and Control Data

To identify hosts sending emails from botnets, we used a trace of hosts infected by the W32/Bobax ("Bobax") worm from April 28-29, 2005. This trace was captured by hijacking the authoritative DNS server for the domain running the command and control (C&C) of the botnet and redirecting it to a machine on a large campus network. This method was possible because (1) the Bobax drones contacted a centralized controller using a domain name, and (2) the researchers obtained the trust of the network operators hosting the authoritative DNS for that domain name. This technique effectively disables the botnet for spamming during this period and allows us to collect a packet trace to determine the members of the botnet.

To obtain a sample of spamming behavior from known botnets, we correlated Bobax botnet membership from the 1.5-day trace of Bobax drones with the IP addresses from which we received spam in the sinkhole trace. While this method is not perfect—hosts may be patched over the course of our spam trace—previous work suggests that the patching rate is slow enough for many infected hosts to remain unpatched [19]. Another limitation is that if hosts use dynamic addressing, different hosts (some Bobax-infected and some not) may share an IP address observed in the Bobax trace. However, we observed a significantly higher percentage of Windows hosts in the subset of spam messages sent by IP addresses in our Bobax trace compared to the complete spam dataset, suggesting that these IP addresses were indeed part of a spamming botnet.

### 2.4 BGP Routing Measurements

We studied the reachability of the IP addresses of mail relays from which we received spam and how long they remained reachable. We were particularly interested in cases where a route for an IP address was only reachable for a short period, coinciding with the time spam was sent. To measure network-layer reachability, we co-located a BGP monitor in the same network as our spam sinkhole, similar to our previous work [7]. The monitor receives BGP updates from the border router, and our analysis includes a BGP update stream that overlaps with our spam trace. The monitor sees only BGP updates that cause a change in the border router’s choice of the best route to a prefix. Despite not observing all BGP updates, the monitor provides enough information to study the properties of short-lived BGP route announcements.

### 3. Network-Level Characteristics of Spammers

In this section, we examine the first-order network-level characteristics of spam sources. We survey the portions of IP address space from which our sinkhole received spam and the Autonomous Systems (ASes) that sent spam to the sinkhole. We also observe the persistence of these characteristics over time. To determine whether these network-level characteristics could be suitable for spam filtering, we compare them with the same characteristics for legitimate email, as received at a large domain managing approximately 40 million mailboxes.

#### 3.1 Distribution Across Networks

To determine the address space from which spam was arriving ("prevalence") and whether the distribution across IP addresses changes over time ("persistence"), we tabulated the spam in our trace by IP address space. We found that spam arrivals across IP space are far from uniform.

**Finding 3.1 (Distribution across IP address space):** The majority of spam is sent from a relatively small fraction of IP address space.

Figure 2 shows the number of spam email messages received over the entire trace, as a function of IP address space. Several ranges of IP address space originate a large amount of email traffic (both spam and legitimate), including space allocated to cable modem providers (e.g., 24.*) and the address space allocated to the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC) regional Internet registry (e.g., 61.*). Most IP address ranges that originate a significant amount of spam also originate a lot of legitimate mail traffic, but a few IP address ranges have significantly more spam than legitimate mail (e.g., 80.*–90.*), and vice versa (e.g., 60.*–70.*). This characteristic suggests that it may be possible to use IP address ranges to distinguish spam from legitimate email.

We repeated the analysis of the network-level characteristics of spam per day across months, per month across years, and so forth. We also compared the distribution of spam collected at our sinkhole to the distribution of rejected SMTP connections at the domain where we performed our analysis of legitimate email and found that the distribution of these connections across IP address space is similar to that shown in Figure 2. All of these distributions have remained roughly constant over time.

In contrast, individual IP addresses are far more transient. Figure 3 shows that even though a few IP addresses sent more than 10,000 emails, about 85% of client IP addresses sent less than 10 emails to the sinkhole, indicating that targeting an individual IP address might not help mitigate spam without sharing information across domains. This finding has an important implication for spam filter design: though the individual IP addresses from which spam is received changes from day-to-day, the fact that spam continually comes from the same IP address space suggests that incorporating these more persistent features may be more effective, particularly in portions of the IP address space that send either mostly spam or mostly legitimate email.

In many cases, IP address ranges are not adequate for distinguishing spam from legitimate email. To determine whether other network-level properties, such as the AS from which the email was sent, could serve as better classifiers, we examined the distribution of spam across ASes and compared this feature to the distribution of legitimate email across ASes.

**Finding 3.2 (Distribution across ASes):** More than 10% of spam received at our sinkhole originated from mail relays in two ASes. Table 1 shows the amount of spam received from mail relays in the top 20 ASes. Eleven of the top 20 networks from which we received spam are primarily based in the United States.

This table highlights the concentration of spam in a few ASes, suggesting that focusing on high-volume, persistent groups of spammers (e.g., by AS number) might be more effective than blacklisting individual IP addresses, many of which are transient.
