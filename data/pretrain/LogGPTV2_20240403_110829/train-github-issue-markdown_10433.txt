##### Detailed description
Use the `cv::VideoCapture::get()` function with a parameter value of
`cv::CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC` to get the time of the current video frame.  
The time value obtained on some frames at the end of the video is always 0,
and these frames further ahead are normal time values.  
I've tried some videos and it's always like this, my local videos are very
easy to reproduce this issue.
