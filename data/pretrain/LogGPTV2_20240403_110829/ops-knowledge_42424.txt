User: Describe the flow of the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol.
Assistant: The flow of the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol is as follows: 1. The third-party application initiates an authorization request: the user clicks the authorization button in the third-party application, and the third-party application initiates an authorization request to the authentication server (Authorization Server). The request includes the client ID, callback address ( Redirect URI) and other information. 2. User authorization: The authentication server verifies the user's identity and asks the user whether to authorize the third-party application. After the user agrees to authorize, the authentication server redirects back to the callback address of the third-party application with the authorization code (Authorization Code). 3. Obtaining an Access Token: After obtaining the authorization code, the third-party application sends a request to the authentication server to obtain an access token. The request includes information such as the client ID, client secret (Client Secret), and authorization code. The authentication server issues an access token after verifying that the information is correct. 4. Use the access token to access the API: The third-party application carries the access token to request data from the API server, and the API server returns the requested data after verifying the access token. 5. Refresh the access token: the access token has an expiration time and needs to be refreshed after expiration. The refresh process is similar to obtaining the access token, but the old access token and refresh token (Refresh Token) need to be provided. 6. Cancellation of authorization: The user can cancel the authorization at any time. After the authorization is cancelled, the third-party application can no longer access the user's data.
