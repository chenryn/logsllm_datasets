**ATT&CK ID:** T1546.015  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Component Object Model Hijacking

Adversaries may establish persistence by hijacking references to Component Object Model (COM) objects, thereby triggering the execution of malicious content. COM is a system in Windows that facilitates interaction between software components through the operating system. References to various COM objects are stored in the Windows Registry. By modifying these references, attackers can redirect legitimate calls to their own malicious code, allowing them to maintain persistence on the compromised system.
