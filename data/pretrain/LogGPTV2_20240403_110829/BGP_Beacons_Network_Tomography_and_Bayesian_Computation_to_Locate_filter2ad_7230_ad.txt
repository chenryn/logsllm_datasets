6.1 Pinpointing RFD ASs with BeCAUSe
Figure 11 highlights the output of BeCAUSe and detailed category
shares are shown in Table 2. The scatterplot depicts two summary
metrics of the output distributions to plot the average probability of
damping against the certainty of this estimate. We use one minus
the length of the HDPI to quantify certainty, so more confident
estimates are closer to 1. The x-axis is a measure of how likely

an AS uses RFD, and the y-axis is a measure of the spread‚Äîhow
sure we are of our x-axis estimate. The ASs are colored by category
determined by the process introduced in Section 5.1. There is a
characteristic U shape. On the right we have ASs that are likely
using RFD as shown by the high average ¬Øùëùùëñ. ASs in the top right
are on a large number of RFD paths and so have a high certainty,
e.g., AS 20932 in Figure 9(a). For ASs where there is less data (but
not contradictory), we see our confidence decrease but the average
¬Øùëùùëñ still suggests RFD. Conversely, on the top left we have ASs that
are on many non-RFD paths, e.g., AS 2497 in Figure 9(b). For ASs
that are on less paths we have less information, but the average
remains high as we see in the Category 1 and 2 ASs (blue and
green). The base with low evidence suggests ASs for which we
have little information, and we recover the prior with high spread,
e.g., AS 12874 in Figure 9(d).
The ASs in Category 4 that are spread across the plot are quite
interesting. Such cases suggest we have contradictory information
about these ASs‚Äîprobably due to inconsistent damping. For exam-
ple, recall the distribution of AS 701 in Figure 9(c) that has a low
probability of damping, because on the majority of labeled paths it
receives updates from AS 2497, which is a neighbor that is not being
damped. Despite the low mean probability, our pinpointing method
has identified this AS, and others, as RFD as they are the most likely
ASs to be causing RFD on some damped paths as described in ¬ß 5.1.
Figure 11 shows grey vertical lines at ¬Øùëù = 0.3 and ¬Øùëù = 0.7. These
are the category cut-offs from ¬ß 5.1, chosen to segment the region
into the three distinct different regions over the different update
intervals.
Our results suggest that 9.1% (sum of Category 4 and 5) is the
lower bound of RFD deployment. There a three reasons why we
may have labeled a damping AS as non-damping. First, an AS
damping solely customers is not detectable with our setup because
our Beacons are located in or close to Tier-1 providers and thus
the Beacon signals travel only from a provider to a customer or
between peers in the Internet topology. This is confirmed by the
observation that less than 3% of links on the measured paths are
customer links. Second, an update interval of 1 minute may not
be small enough to trigger some configurations. Third, a damping
ASs may be hiding behind another damping AS, so our updates
are already being suppressed before they can reach this AS. This
last issue would be much more significant if RFD deployment was
larger. With the above challenges and visibility issues, it is, with
our measurement setup, impossible to establish an upper bound for
RFD deployment.
6.2 Deployed RFD Parameters
RFD is configurable in various ways. To target different configu-
rations, we used 6 different update intervals. Figure 12 visualizes

update interval. Only ASs measured in all 6 experiments are

the share of ASs using RFD for a given update interval. The orange
bars indicate the share of RFD-enabled ASs for which we have non-
contradicting data, i.e., damping all neighbors consistently. These
ASs have been labeled using only the probability of damping (step
(1) in ¬ß 5.1). The blue bars include inconsistently damping ASs that
were labeled with step (2). We observe an unexpected spike at 2
minutes as a single AS with a large customer cone damps inconsis-
tently.
While Figure 12 illustrates how quickly a prefix needs to flap
to get damped, we cannot infer the exact value of the suppress-
threshold in use because one Beacon event may cause multiple up-
dates distant in topology (e.g., path hunting). We assume, however,
that many operators use predefined configurations, and try to find
confirmation in our data. Currently, there are two sources of param-
eter sets: (i) the recommendations by the IETF and RIPE [5, 17], and
(ii) vendors that ignore these recommendations and pre-configure a
deprecated suppress-threshold (see Appendix B). The largest fraction
of ASs stop dampening for update intervals larger than 5 minutes
(Figure 12). A router with deprecated default values would start
damping at the 5 minutes update interval. We suspect the continu-
ous increase of RFD ASs for the smaller update intervals is caused
by some network operators following the current recommendations.
The very few damping ASs at 10 or 15 minutes are likely induced
by updates amplified by topology properties. Based on feedback
from almost 50 network operators we were able to confirm that
there is a significant tendency (‚âà60%) to use vendor default values.
To expose the announcement pattern of damped paths we ana-
lyzed the max-suppress-time values that are used in practise. Fig-
ure 13 visualizes the distribution of the mean time delta between
the end of the Burst and the re-advertisement across all damped
paths for the entire measurement period. First, we notice that the
time until re-advertisement (r-delta) rarely surpasses 60 minutes,
suggesting a large max-suppress-time is uncommon. For the small-
est update interval (1 minute) we find three plateaus, starting at 10,
30, and 60 minutes, indicating that these are the most commonly
configured values for the max-suppress-time parameter. The same

measurement setup, hence it is not possible for the pinpointing
methods to locate these ASs.
The MCMC methods perform better than the heuristics regard-
ing precision, although the heuristics already yield 97% precession
(see Table 4). In some challenging cases, the heuristics will incor-
rectly label ASs with RFD True, when they are on many RFD paths
but are not causing them. This is the case for AS 5645, for example.
BeCAUSe considers the entire path data in the likelihood and so
accounts for this but only flags the upstream AS and identifies that
there is no information about these downstream ASs. However,
in these cases when evidence from the labelled paths is lacking
BeCAUSe labels the AS as unsure (e.g., AS 37474), while two of the
metrics for the heuristics use additional data from the raw update
dumps to identify these nodes. The MCMC algorithm flags incon-
sistently damping ASs, which cannot be found by the heuristics,
by identifying ASs that are most likely to be causing the damping
signal (recall ¬ß 5.1).
As network tomography problems assume nodes act consistently,
the most challenging scenario is the deployment of heterogeneous
RFD configurations, e.g., an AS damps only customers. We could
instead pinpoint individual AS links, but, unfortunately, when con-
sidering links, our data is too sparse to gain reasonable results from
BeCAUSe or the heuristics.
Although the overall results of BeCAUSE appear to be on par
with our heuristics, it is important to note that the heuristics are tai-
lored to a specific pinpointing use case. In contrast to this, BeCAUSe
is generic, which we will show in the next section.
7 APPLYING BeCAUSe BEYOND RFD
The BeCAUSe algorithm uses a simple likelihood model and does
not require domain knowledge, e.g., RFD. In this section, we present
the effective application of the same algorithm to locate a different
AS property, route origin filtering, and briefly discuss general usage.
7.1 Pinpointing ROV ASs with BeCAUSe
We are interested in locating ASs that drop invalid routes (i.e., those
IP prefixes that are announced from incorrect origin ASs) using
RPKI route origin validation (ROV) [26]. In this section we first
simulate the output of an ROV measurement using real-world AS
paths and a set of ASs known to use ROV. Then, we benchmark
BeCAUSe using this dataset. Therefore, this experiment does not
uncover new ROV ASs, but simply benchmarks BeCAUSe in a
different plausible use case.
(a) 1 Minute update interval
(b) 3 Minutes update interval

small enough to unveil the max-suppress-times (red lines).
pattern cannot be observed for the slightly larger 3 minute up-
date interval and even less for 5, 10, and 15 minutes (not shown).
For these larger update intervals, the penalty decreases naturally
faster below the reuse-threshold and before the max-suppress-time
expires.
6.3 Comparison to Operator Ground Truth
Pinpointing RFD ASs on paths that include only a vantage point
and our Beacon AS is not challenging. Limiting ourselves to these
scenarios (‚âà 3%) would, however, significantly reduce the amount of
ASs we can draw a conclusion about. BeCAUSe allows us to include
paths of arbitrary length giving much wider coverage. To validate
our findings we directly contacted network operators of every
measured AS and received 75 replies in total. Unfortunately, we
cannot map the provided configurations to exact update intervals
from our experiment (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 min) because effects such as
path hunting increase the number of updates along the path, and
make our results less sharp. Therefore, we chose to compare our
results for the smallest update interval (1 minute) to ground truth.
Overall, BeCAUSe performs very well on this small dataset with
100% precision compared to the heuristics, which have one false
positive. The recall is 87% (80% for the heuristics) mainly due to
visibility issues. We summarize the main reasons of divergence in
Table 3. We removed two ASs, namely AS 8218 and AS 7575, from
the ground truth dataset, as they are not detectable with our current

To label AS paths as ROV (or non-ROV) we make use of existing
data sources that accurately pinpoint ROV ASs, either based on
strictly controlled experiments [32] or ground truth [11]. From Iso-
lario, RouteViews, and RIPE RIS we collect all AS paths of two RPKI
Beacon prefixes (147.28.241.0/24 and 147.28.249.0/24 [32]),
and label the AS paths ROV (or non-ROV) if one of the ROV ASs is
on path (or non-ROV otherwise).
While it is possible to change parts of our pinpointing algorithm,
we use the same implementation to locate ROV as in locating RFD
ASs. There are two key differences in contrast to the RFD dataset:
(i) 90% of paths are labeled ROV (versus 18% for RFD) and (ii) noise
is absent.
BeCAUSe has good performance on this dataset and leads to
100% precision and 64% recall (see Table 4). The ASs that were
missed are only seen on paths with another ROV filtering AS. For
these ASs it is impossible to infer ROV usage, because they are
‚Äòhiding‚Äô behind another ROV AS. This is a common issue in network
tomography, unrelated to BeCAUSe, where two nodes only ever
appearing together on ROV paths are unable to untangle which (or
both) are displaying our property of interest.
7.2 Towards Other Scenarios
There are many options to extend BeCAUSe, within binary tomog-
raphy or even more generally. The algorithm itself remains the
same; however, we can use different models and summarisation
techniques should our application or research question change. One
useful extension is to include error explicitly in the likelihood model
ùëÉ(ùê∑|p). For example, using our measurement method for RFD, it is
possible that paths containing an RFD AS do not get recorded as
RFD paths. We can model this error in the likelihood. Using a new
likelihood model can enable the application of this method to net-
work tomography problems beyond the binary problem introduced
here.
8 RELATED WORK
Network Tomography: A good survey of the early work on net-
work tomography is provided in [8]. Early approaches aimed at
inferring the origins of performance events using highly correlated
multicast [6, 15] or striped unicast packets [12, 16]. The ideas were
extended to summary statistics using alternative measurements,
e.g., passive measurement [29], however early work concentrated
on additive metrics, where the relationships between internal net-
work properties could be expressed as linear relationships leading
503
to deterministic algorithms even where the underlying model was
stochastic.
