**ATT&CK ID:** G0045  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** menuPass

**Description:**
menuPass, a known threat actor, employs various obfuscation techniques in its malware to evade detection. Specifically, it encodes strings using base64 and applies a simple, single-byte XOR obfuscation with the key `0x40`.[207][208][209]

This dual-layered approach enhances the malware's ability to remain undetected by security tools, making it more challenging for defenders to analyze and mitigate the threat.
