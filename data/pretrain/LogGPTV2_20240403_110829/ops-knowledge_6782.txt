User: What are the main procedures an organization should follow in order to implement CIS Control 16.11, Leverage Vetted Modules or Services for Application Security Components?
Assistant: An organization should Leverage vetted modules or services for application security components, such as identity management, encryption, and auditing and logging. Using platform features in critical security functions will reduce developersâ€™ workload and minimize the likelihood of design or implementation errors. Modern operating systems provide effective mechanisms for identification, authentication, and authorization and make those mechanisms available to applications. Use only standardized, currently accepted, and extensively reviewed encryption algorithms. Operating systems also provide mechanisms to create and maintain secure audit logs.CIS Control 16.11 has the asset type Applications, and has the security function Protect.
