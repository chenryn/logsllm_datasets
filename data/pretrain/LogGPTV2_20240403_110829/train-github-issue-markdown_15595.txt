I am currently working on running an LSTM model, which was developed using the Python API and then exported to a Protocol Buffers (protobuf) format for evaluation in Java. After updating my Python scripts to use `tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMBlockCell` and `LSTMBlockFusedCell` cell implementations, the Java part of the project stopped functioning and began to throw the following exceptions:

1. `org.tensorflow.TensorFlowException: Op type not registered 'BlockLSTM' in binary running on xubuntu. Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process.`
2. `org.tensorflow.TensorFlowException: Op type not registered 'LSTMBlockCell' in binary running on xubuntu. Make sure the Op and Kernel are registered in the binary running in this process.`

The graph can be evaluated without issues in Python. I have not found any relevant solutions on Stack Overflow, but there are a couple of GitHub issues that might be related: #11847 and #12566.

**Environment Details:**
- TensorFlow Version (Java and Python): 1.3.0
- Python Version: 2.7

If you have encountered similar issues or have any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate your input.
