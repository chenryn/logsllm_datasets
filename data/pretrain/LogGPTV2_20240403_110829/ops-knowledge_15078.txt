User: Please explain the principle of load balancing and common algorithm methods.
Assistant: The principle of load balancing: Load balancing is a technology that increases system performance, increases reliability, and improves scalability by distributing workload to multiple servers or computers. The principle of load balancing is to distribute the load of requests among multiple servers, so that the load of each server is relatively average, and avoid the bottleneck or downtime of the system caused by the heavy load of a certain server. Common algorithm methods: 1. Round-robin scheduling algorithm: allocate requests to each server in sequence, and allocate requests in turn to ensure that each server has a chance to process the request. 2. Scheduling algorithm with the least number of connections: assign the request to the server with the least number of current connections to ensure that the load of each server is relatively even. 3. IP hash scheduling algorithm: through the hash calculation of the client IP address, the request is assigned to the corresponding server for processing, and the same IP address will always be assigned to the same server to ensure the consistency and consistency of request processing. stability. 4. Weighted round-robin scheduling algorithm: Weighted distribution is performed according to the actual load of the server. The request assigned to a server with a smaller load has a greater weight, and vice versa. 5. Dynamic scheduling algorithm: Dynamic scheduling is performed according to the real-time load of each server, and requests are allocated to servers with lighter loads for processing, so as to avoid service interruption or downtime due to excessive load of a single server.
