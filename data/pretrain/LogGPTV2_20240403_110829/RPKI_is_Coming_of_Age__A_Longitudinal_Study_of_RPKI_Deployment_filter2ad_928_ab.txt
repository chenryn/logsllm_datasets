VRP; if so, it then determines whether the announcement matches
the VRP. In more detail, an IP prefix in a BGP announcement is
said to be covered by a VRP when the IP prefix address and the VRP
IP prefix address are identical for all bits specified by the VRP IP
prefix length. A BGP announcement is considered to match a VRP
when (1) the VRP IP prefix covers the announcement’s IP prefix,
(2) the VRP AS matches the announcement’s AS, and (3) the length
of the announcement’s prefix is no greater than the MaxLength in
the VRP.
Hence, a BGP announcement received by a validating router is
in one of the three possible RPKI validity states:
• Valid: the BGP announcement is matched by a VRP,
• Invalid: the IP prefix in the BGP announcement is covered by a
VRP, but no VRP matches the announcement,4
• Unknown: the IP prefix in the BGP announcement is not covered
by any VRP.
For example, consider VRPs published by Rochester Institute of
Technology (AS4385). AS 4385 can announce one of its IP prefixes
by sending a BGP announcement to its neighbors:
129.21.0.0/16, AS PATH: AS4385
The neighbors can verify the origin of the BGP announcement by
looking up VRPs, and will find that there is a VRP which matches.
Thus, this announcement is considered valid.5 However the follow-
ing BGP announcement is considered invalid as it is covered by at
least one VRP (for 129.21.0.0/16), but not matched by any VRP:
129.21.240.0/24, AS PATH: AS4385
Finally, the following BGP announcement is considered unknown
as there is no VRP that covers the announced prefix:
129.22.128.0/17, AS PATH: AS4385
Also, routers do not need to do any cryptographic verification to per-
form this analysis, as it done purely on the basis of VRPs obtained
from RP software. Because of this, BGP origin prefix validation is
supported by many routers, and does not incur a significant cost in
terms of memory or CPU usage on routers.
2.5 Related Work
In this section, we discuss work related to understanding the RPKI
ecosystem and other approaches for securing BGP.
RPKI ecosystem There have been a number of studies [15, 25, 29,
43, 58] that focused on the deployment status of RPKI; Gilad et
al. [25] studied RPKI adoption from the perspective of network
operators; they tried to understand the challenges and incentives to
deploy RPKI by performing a survey among network practitioners.
Cohen et al. [11] showed that a partial deployment can also yield
4Hence, the origin AS can authorize only IP prefixes that match
the VRPs; this is to enforce aggregation and prevent (sub-)prefix hi-
jacking, in which a more specific prefix is announced than specified
at the origin.
5Note that RPKI does not protect against “AS-in-the-middle
attacks” where an attacker prepends its AS to the origin AS on the
AS PATH; the neighbors will only attempt to validate the origin.

significant security benefits through simulations. Reuter et al. [43]
proposed active measurement techniques using BGP announce-
ments under their control to study the uptake of RPKI validation
among network operators. Cartwright [15] proposes a data plane
approach to achieve the same goal through ICMP messages.
W¨ahlisch et al. [58] focused on the deployment of RPKI in the
Web ecosystem by checking announcements for prefixes hosting
Alexa 1M websites. They found, surprisingly, that less popular web-
sites are more likely to be secured than prominent sites.
Other studies focused on the security of RPKI; Gilad et al. [26]
pointed out that the MaxLength attribute of ROAs could weaken
BGP security unless all sub-prefixes matched on an ROA with the
MaxLength attribute were actually announced. Cooper et al. [12]
showed that sophisticated attacks on RPKI repositories could cause
transient failures of RPKI, thus taking some IP prefixes offline.
Researchers have also studied and developed RPKI looking
glasses and software to inspect the current state of deploy-
ment [44, 48, 49] and help operators verify correct RPKI deploy-
ment [18, 51, 52].
Our study extends these prior works in three ways. First, we
examine all ROAs from all RIRs since the beginning of RPKI over 8
years ago. Second, we examine the current RPKI deployment status
using both RPKI objects as well as actual BGP announcements se-
cured by RPKI. Third, we examine more types of misconfigurations
and potentially suspicious BGP announcements, which requires
longitudinal data.
Deploying BGP security protocols There is a large body of work
that studies security issues in BGP [5, 27], investigates common
misconfigurations [38], proposes security extensions to BGP such
as soBGP [59], S-BGP[32], BGPsec [23], or identifies overall chal-
lenges to securing interdomain routing [21]. Due to the massively
distributed nature of the network, however, it has been challenging
to estimate the deployment status of these security protocols or
even compare the pros and cons across different security protocols.
Gill et al. pointed out that security concerns alone do not provide
sufficient motivation for network operators to deploy new security
protocols, and thus proposed a strategy to encourage adoption of
BGP security protocols (e.g., BGPsec) by providing appropriate in-
centives to ISPs [20]. On the other hand, Subramanian et al. sought
an alternative, easier to deploy, way to ensure path security using
cryptographic functions to check bogus route advertisements in
the control plane [53]. Several studies compared the effectiveness
of BGP security protocols by quantifying the impact of attacks

that BGP security protocols that aim for path validation such as
BGPsec actually provide only modest benefits over origin authenti-
cation [35] protocols such as RPKI.
3 DATASETS AND APPROACH
We start out by briefly discussing the datasets we use and our
general approach for analyzing this data.
3.1 RPKI data
Each of the five RIRs maintains an rsync repository with RPKI data
that relying parties can query in order to perform RPKI validation.
The RIPE NCC has maintained a daily archive of the repositories for
all five RIRs since the beginning of 2011;6 we are grateful to RIPE
NCC for making this data available for analysis. Table 1 provides
an overview of this dataset for each of the RIRs.
3.2 BGP data
In order to understand how ROAs affect routing table construction,
we need BGP announcements as well. Thus, we leverage three
datasets with BGP announcement data as shown in Table 2. The
first two datasets are publicly available and cover the entirety of
the period for which we also have RPKI data. However, these public
datasets rely on a relatively limited number of vantage points, which
can lead to a biased view of routing [41].
To mitigate this, we have also obtained a much larger dataset
from a large CDN that contains BGP announcement data from
thousands of vantage points globally. While the large CDN dataset
provides us a much greater coverage of BGP announcements, it
comes with two caveats. First, the dataset was only available begin-
ning in 2017, and thus we only have data for the final two years of
the study. Second, the dataset comes from direct peering between
the CDN and various ASes, and it contains many private BGP an-
nouncements (i.e., those announced only to the CDN). Thus, from
the large CDN dataset, we remove the private BGP announcements
by only keeping announcements for IP prefixes where we observed
a corresponding BGP announcement for that prefix on that day in
one of the public data sets.
6There are a few days over the eight year time period during
which data was not recorded correctly: out of 2,952 days during the
measurement period, data was unavailable on 45 (1.52%) of them.

Across all of the data sets, we use over 46 billion BGP announce-
ments for analysis in the remainder of the paper. Finally, a note
about terminology: whenever we refer to authorizations published
in RPKI repositories, we will use the term ROAs. In most cases,
however, we are discussing validation, in which case we will use
the term VRPs, as that is how such data is typically processed by
routers.
3.3 IPv4 vs. IPv6
This paper focuses exclusively on IPv4, and does not analyze or
compare our findings with IPv6. We do so for a number of reasons.
First, in a preliminary analysis we performed of the IPv6 data, we
did not observe apparent differences between IPv6 and IPv4 in
terms of trends in growth of the number of VRPs [46]7. Hence,
analyzing IPv6 did not provide much additional information about
the development of the RPKI as an ecosystem. Second, it is difficult
to conduct apples-to-apples comparisons between IPv4 and IPv6
deployments. For example, consider our analysis of the fraction of
the address space covered by the RPKI. The IPv4 address space is
much more densely allocated and announced relative to IPv6, and
thus the fraction of address spaced covered by the RPKI for IPv4
would be much larger. However, this says nothing of the disparity
in terms of how much traffic such prefixes cover, making it difficult
to understand the impact of such differences between IPv4 and IPv6.
To avoid confusion, we limit ourselves to IPv4 and leave analysis
of IPv6 (along with corresponding traffic volumes) to future work.
We note that the datasets we released include data for IPv6 and
most of the tools we ship to use with the datasets (most notably
the validation tool called “Ziggy”) support processing of IPv6 data.
4 RPKI DEPLOYMENT
We begin our analysis of RPKI by focusing on the deployment in
terms of the number of ROAs we see in the RPKI repositories, and
the fraction of ASes that are using RPKI, and the fraction of all IPv4
space that it covers. To do so, we perform a longitudinal analysis
of all RPKI objects along with over 46 billion BGP announcements
collected from more than 3,300 different vantage points to answer
two questions: 1) how have network operators published ROAs to
protect their resources? and 2) how many BGP announcements are
actually covered by VRPs?
4.1 Deployment of VRPs
Our goal in this section is to conduct a large-scale, longitudinal, and
detailed study of RPKI adoption. To observe how network operators
have deployed RPKI since the early days of its launch,8 we use the
RPKI repository data we received from RIPE. Table 1 shows the
number of VRPs, derived from ROAs, in each of the trust anchors
(i.e., RIRs) as well as the percentage of ASes that have at least one
VRP.9 Figure 2 plots the number of VRPs, the percentage of ASes
that have at least one VRP, and the IP space covered by VRPs in
7As of May 2019.
8APNIC, LACNIC, RIPENCC, AFRINIC launched their RPKI
service in January 2011 and ARIN did so in September 2012 [39].
9To do this, we calculate the number of ASes and the IP space
allocated to each of the RIRs by analyzing all NRO statistics (Number
Resource Organization) [47].
Figure 2: The growth of RPKI in terms of the # of VRP IP
prefixes, the % of ASes where some of their IPv4 addresses
are covered by VRPs to all ASes managed by the RIR, the %
of IPv4 addresses covered by VRPs to all assigned IPv4 ad-
dresses for the RIR.
each of the RIRs. From the table and figures, we make a number of
observations.
First, we observe a general increasing trend in all three graphs
in Figure 2, indicating a significant and increasing adoption of
RPKI both in terms of the number of ASes that have VRPs and
the fraction of IP space covered by a VRP. This is encouraging as
previous work [25] showed that 84% of network practitioners were
not interested in deploying RPKI through a survey in 2016.
Second, we observe that overall RPKI deployment varies signifi-
cantly between RIRs: between 1.38% (ARIN) and 15.11% (RIPENCC)
of ASes are included in one or more VRPs in our latest snapshot,
and between 2.7% (AFRINIC) and 30.6% (RIPENCC) of the total IPv4
address space administered by RIRs is covered by VRPs. Interest-
ingly, a few registries have a rapidly growing RPKI coverage. For
example, the fraction of the total IP space covered by VRPs rose
from 19.2% to 30.6% between January 1, 2017 and February 27, 2019
Third, we observe a few upward “spikes” in the data set. For exam-
ple, the sharp spike between June 6th and 19th, 2017 for the number
