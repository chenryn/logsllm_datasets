I am currently using Firefox ESR 45.1.1 on a 64-bit GNU/Linux Debian (testing) system, and I have encountered an issue with text input. Specifically, I am unable to place the cursor at my desired location within the text. Additionally, when I press the "Enter" key, it skips an extra line instead of moving to the next one as expected.

Furthermore, when this problem occurs, the "Tab" key also malfunctions; it only moves once, even if I click it multiple times. 

**Update:**
I have also observed that when I use the "Ctrl + left arrow" or "Ctrl + right arrow" keys, the cursor does not navigate beyond two or three columns before jumping to the next line.

Could this be related to a code-completion mechanism? This issue persists across all tests, and initially, I thought it might be due to a personal setting or preference.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
