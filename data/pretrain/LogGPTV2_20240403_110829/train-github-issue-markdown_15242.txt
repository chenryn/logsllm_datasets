I'm using Firefox ESR 45.1.1 on GNU / Linux Debian 64-bit, testing.
I cannot place my cursor wherever I want to and not only that; if I press
"Enter" key, instead of taking me on the next line, it skips 1 extra line.
Also, when this issue happens, the tab key stops working properly; it moves
only at a single tab click and nothing more.
UPDATE: I have also noticed that Ctrl - arrow-left or arrow-right does not
nagivate beyond two or three columns before it jumps to the immediate next
line.
Is it something that has to do with code-completion mechanism?  
END_OF_UPDATE
It happens on each test and at first I thought it was my idea.
Any suggestions?
Cheers.
