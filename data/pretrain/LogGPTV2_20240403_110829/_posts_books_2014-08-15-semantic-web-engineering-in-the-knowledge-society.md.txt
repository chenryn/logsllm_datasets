**Authors:** Jorge Cardoso and George D. Magoulas  
**Publisher:** IGI Global, 2008

### Overview

The primary goal of this book is to provide a foundational understanding of the technologies that underpin the Semantic Web. Organizations are increasingly seeking literature that can guide them in developing end-to-end applications and systems that leverage semantic technologies. While the industry is eager to adopt these technologies, academia has yet to fully demonstrate how to systematically employ Semantic Web tools to create a new generation of systems.

### Key Objectives

- **Theoretical Foundations:** The book offers a detailed exploration of the theories, tools, and methodologies essential for developing semantic applications.
- **Practical Applications:** It is designed for students and professionals who wish to deepen their understanding of how semantics and ontologies can be effectively utilized within organizations.
- **Lifecycle Integration:** The text examines the application of semantic technologies across each stage of the semantic application lifecycle, addressing critical issues such as reuse, integration, and interoperability.

### Target Audience

- **Students:** Those studying computer science, information technology, or related fields.
- **Professionals:** Practitioners in the IT and knowledge management sectors looking to enhance their skills in semantic web engineering.

### Availability

You can purchase this book from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Semantic-Engineering-Knowledge-Society-Reference/dp/1605661120 "Title").

By providing a clear and structured approach to Semantic Web engineering, this book serves as an invaluable resource for anyone interested in harnessing the power of semantic technologies in the modern knowledge society.
