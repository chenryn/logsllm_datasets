## Abstract
Secure mobile data charging (MDC) is essential for the operation of cellular networks. It must ensure that the correct user is charged for the authorized data volume they consume, meeting the requirements of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). In this study, we conduct a security analysis of the MDC system in cellular networks. We find that all three AAA components can be compromised in both design and practice, and we identify three specific vulnerabilities: authentication bypass, authorization fraud, and accounting volume inaccuracy. The root causes lie in the fundamental technologies of cellular networks and Internet IP design, as well as imprudent implementations. We devise and demonstrate three showcase attacks that can easily penetrate operational 3G/4G cellular networks. Additionally, we propose and evaluate defense solutions.

## 1. Introduction
Mobile data services have become increasingly popular due to the widespread use of smartphones and tablets, and the rapid deployment of 3G/4G cellular networks. Global mobile data traffic grew by 81% in 2013 and is projected to increase 11-fold over the next five years [16]. This growth is driven by 2.1 billion mobile Internet users worldwide, including 299 million 3G/4G broadband subscribers in the US [25].

While convenient, mobile data access comes at a cost. Most cellular operators charge users based on their consumed data volume [8, 32]. Users pay for data usage at a preset price within a certain volume cap or on a pay-per-use basis. For example, AT&T charges $20 for 300MB per month for domestic access and about 2¢ per KB during international travel [10]. This volume-based charging scheme is justified by the scarcity and expense of radio spectrum and the limitations of wireless speed.

A well-designed and properly operated MDC system is critical for cellular networks. It not only protects the multi-trillion-dollar revenue of global operators but also safeguards the financial rights of billions of mobile users. To enable metered charging, the MDC system must meet three key requirements:
1. **Authentication:** The user being billed must be the one who actually uses the data.
2. **Authorization:** Data usage and associated charges should be with the user’s consent.
3. **Accounting Volume:** The recorded data volume should be accurate.

At first glance, it seems straightforward to meet these requirements. The MDC method is stipulated by the 3GPP specification [3] and is performed within the cellular core network. However, our analysis reveals that the MDC system is vulnerable to authentication bypass, authorization fraud, and accounting volume inaccuracy. These threats can lead to real monetary losses for users.

Moreover, we found that simple attacks can exploit these vulnerabilities in operational 3G/4G networks. Our experiments show that these attacks can be launched without requiring control or access to the victim's phone or the carrier. The incurred charging damage can be significant.

We further analyze the root causes of these vulnerabilities, which include fundamental technology issues and imprudent implementations. To address these issues, we propose and evaluate defense solutions.

Table 1 summarizes our main findings. Before delving into the details, we clarify that this work focuses on the technical aspects of MDC security, not the incentives for attacks. Our contributions are:
- Uncovering security threats in the MDC system and confirming that mobile users are vulnerable to monetary loss.
- Exposing and validating security loopholes in all three AAA dimensions.
- Demonstrating novel attacks that exploit these loopholes through experiments in operational 3G/4G networks.
- Proposing and evaluating defense solutions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: §2 introduces the MDC background, threat model, and experimental methodology. §3 elaborates on our security analysis for each AAA dimension. §4 proposes defense solutions, and §5 evaluates them. §6 compares our work with related research, and §7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Mobile Data Charging in 4G/3G
Figure 1 illustrates the main operations for mobile data delivery and charging in 4G LTE networks. The process is similar for 3G networks and involves four main steps:
1. **User Authentication:** Verify the legitimacy of the user equipment (UE) to use cellular networks.
2. **Bearer Setup:** Establish data bearers for subsequent data transfer.
3. **Data Transfer:** Deliver data packets from the UE to the base station, gateway, and external host.
4. **Volume Accounting:** Collect usage volume when data packets traverse the gateway.

### 2.1 Threat Model
We examine the security vulnerabilities of the MDC system by assuming that the adversary has limited attack power. Specifically, the adversary can be a mobile user or a static host on the Internet, while the victim is typically another mobile user. The adversary has no access to the cellular network infrastructure or other devices and only exploits publicly available information. The adversary controls a programmable smartphone and a remote server, both of which are used to launch attacks.

### 2.2 Experimental Methodology
To validate the security loopholes and assess their impact, we conducted experiments with two major US carriers (OP-I and OP-II) covering more than 50% of US subscribers. Tests were run in various locations across five US states, using different network technologies (4G/3G/2.5G) and several Android phone models. Our experiments were designed to be responsible, ensuring that actual data usage was kept below the data plan cap and that tests were conducted using our own phones as victims.

## 3. Security Analysis of MDC
We now examine each individual security element in MDC. For each element, we analyze its current solution, identify security loopholes, deduce their causes, sketch showcase attacks, and validate them in operational 3G/4G networks. Our primary goal is to identify vulnerabilities in MDC, and the devised attacks illustrate how known attack techniques can be easily applied.
