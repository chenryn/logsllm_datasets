ABSTRACT
Nowadays most IoT devices in smart homes rely on radio frequency
channels for communication, making them exposed to various at-
tacks. Existing methods using encryption keys may be inapplicable
on these resource-constrained devices that cannot afford the com-
putationally expensive encryption operations. Thus, in this paper
we design a key-free communication method for such devices. In
particular, we introduce the Home-limited Channel (HLC) that can
be accessed only within a house yet inaccessible for an outside-
house attacker. Utilizing HLCs, we propose a challenge-response
mechanism to authenticate the communications inside a house. The
advantages of the HlcAuth protocol are low cost, lightweight as
well as key-free, and requiring no human intervention. We show
that HlcAuth can defeat replay attacks, message-forgery attacks,
and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, among others. HlcAuth
achieves 100% true positive rate (TPR) within 4.2m for in-house
devices while 0% false positive rate (FPR) for outside attackers.

daily life by allowing users to interact and control home appliances
in both local and remote manners. However, the proliferation of
IoT smart devices in smart homes induces security vulnerabilities
and privacy concerns [3, 9, 11, 17]. By breaking the communication
between these smart home devices, one can launch replay attacks,
message-forgery attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks from out-
side the home. In this paper, we propose a secure communication
scheme to eliminate attacks from outside attackers.
In a typical smart home (shown in Fig. 1), smart devices and gate-
ways form a home network, and they communicate via one of the
standard wireless communication protocols, e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave,
WiFi and etc. When a user wants to control a device, he maneu-
vers the application. Then, the application sends the command
to a server via the Internet, which in turn relays the command
to the gateway. Finally, the gateway transmits the command to
the target device in a wireless way. Although numerous secure
communication protocols [5] can be applied to protect the com-
munication between applications and gateways, the key challenge
is how to protect the wireless communication between the
gateways and all smart devices, especially the devices that
are resource-constrained. This is the focus of this paper.
Traditional encryption-based methods may be computationally
too expense for resource-constrained smart devices. For instance,
validating an RSA-based signature may overwhelm a light bulb.
Much effort has been devoted to designing a lightweight authenti-
cation scheme [8, 10]. Poor practices, such as choosing weak keys
or sharing one key among all devices, are not unusual and result in
vulnerabilities. To address the issue, we design a key-free commu-
nication strategy that does not rely on distributing cryptography
keys and is applicable to all devices that have various degrees of
computation capability.
The basis of our strategy is that it is the gateway that sends out
control commands to smart devices, and gateways are typically

environment, since the home area is physically isolated by walls
and doors. As such, validating the authenticity of commands is
equivalent to ensuring that the sender of the commands is located
inside the trusted areas, e.g., a house or an apartment. Thus, we
can avoid the complication imposed by key management and rely
on the home-area physical property instead. To validate whether a
sender is located inside a house, we study the home-limited channels
(HLCs) and design a HLC-based challenge-response protocol (here-
after HlcAuth) for key-free and secure communication in smart
homes. The key of HLC is that only when both the sender and a
receiver are inside a home, can they reliably communicate. If either
party is outside a home, they can no longer hear each other. To
construct an HLC, we investigate a few communication medias,
and choose three candidates—infrared, ultrasound and modulated
visible light (MVL). All three candidates are imperceptible and
boundary-attenuated.
Our proposed HLC-based command authentication scheme—
HlcAuth works as follows. A gateway sends a control command to
a device using the traditional wireless channel. To validate whether
the command is indeed sent by the gateway, the device initiates
a challenge-response query to the gateway. If the gateway passes
the challenge-response test within an allowed window time, the
device concludes that the command is valid. All messages that are
associated with the challenge-responses are transmitted over HLC.
The underlying principle is that no compromised device can be in
the home area or no attacker can enter the home, only the gateway
inside the home can receive the challenge and send a response over
an HLC.
In summary. the contributions of our paper are listed as follows:
• We proposed the concept of home-limited channels and in-
vestigated candidate communication medias.
• We designed HlcAuth, a light-weight challenge-response
protocol, for authenticating smart devices without using any
cryptography key.
• We implemented and tested HlcAuth in four different physi-
cal scenarios. Results show HlcAuth can achieve 100% TPR
within 4.2m and 0% FPR for devices in home .
2 BACKGROUND AND THREAT MODEL
In this section, we introduce the components of a typical smart
home system and present our threat model.
2.1 Smart Home Architecture
As shown in Fig. 2, a modern smart home system generally consists
of four parts: 1) smart devices, 2) gateway(s), 3) server(s), 4) one
or several clients. Typically, smart devices communicate with a
home gateway over RF channels using home area network (HAN)
protocols (e.g. ZigBee, Wi-Fi), and the gateway communicates with
a server and users’ mobile devices over the Internet. The server is a
trusted entity, and is responsible for long-term storage and analysis
over large data streams. Users can operate smart devices through
the home gateway directly or indirectly through an application.
The gateway takes responsibility for controlling the network
data, devices and network interoperability. It can broadcast com-
mands and queries to devices in the HAN, whenever needed. Smart

devices transmit home data to the gateway using a single-hop link,
and the communication between smart devices should be forwarded
by the gateway. In addition, a smart home system may have multiple
home gateways, which are distributed in the different rooms. They
generally communicate with each other over secure RF channels
with encryption.
2.2 Threat Model
The attacker’s goal is to control smart devices and get user informa-
tion by exploiting the vulnerabilities in home area networks. First,
we assume prior work like "ZKP authentication" [5] are employed
to protect the communication between gateways and applications,
such that an attacker cannot inject forged messages to control smart
devices by this link. Second, we assume that attackers cannot gain
physical access to the smart home while they can launch various
attacks over RF and HLC channels, and hereafter we call them local
outside attackers. Here we describe the characteristics and abilities
of local outside attackers in detail, as follows.
No Physical Access into a House. Since the smart home is an
enclosed and private space, malicious attackers generally cannot
gain physical access to the home. Numerous work and reports
[3, 9, 11, 17] have shown that local attackers who are close to HAN
yet outside the trusted home can hack into the HAN and control
smart devices. Therefore, this paper focuses on defending against
local outside attackers.
Multiple Attacks. Attackers may launch the following attacks
over the RF and HLC channel. 1) Replay attacks, whereby an at-
tacker records a valid command transmission and repeats it. 2)
Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, whereby an attacker secretly
relays and possibly alters the communication between the gateway
and smart devices. 3) Message-Forgery attacks, whereby an attacker
sends a fake command on behalf of a legal gateway.
Attacking Equipments. We assume that attackers can acquire
both sensors (e.g. infrared and ultrasound sensors) and RF signal
transceiver modules for eavesdropping, intercepting and injecting
over RF and HLC channels.
3 HOME-LIMITED CHANNEL
In this section, we first define a home-limited channel (HLC) and
further elaborate properties that required for it. Then we present
three candidate HLCs—infrared, ultrasound and modulated visible
light (MVL), and describe them in detail.
Session 1: Embedded System Security ASIACCS’18, June 4–8, 2018, Incheon, Republic of Korea303.1 Definition and Properties
We define a home-limited channel as the channel of which the
signal transmission range is within a home. For instance, signals
transmitted over the indoor infrared channel can not be detected
outside since infrared cannot penetrate the boundary (e.g., walls
and doors) of a house. To achieve adequate security and usability,
the following properties should be considered.
Boundary-attenuated means the signals over HLCs are in-
tensely attenuated when propagating through the boundary of a
residence, e.g., walls and doors. Thus, it is difficult for local outside
attackers to launch replay, MiTM, or masquerade attacks.
Imperceptible. The message transmitted over HLC channels
should be transparent to users, which means the transmission sig-
nals are supposed to be inaudible and unobservable.
Lightweight and Energy efficient. The data traffic over HLCs
should be lightweight since numerous smart home devices are
resource-constrained, and the transmission process over HLCs
should be energy efficient. The extra-hardware of HLC sensors
should be low-cost and easy to install.
3.2 HLC Candidates
According to the definition and properties of HLCs, we choose three
HLC candidates—infrared, ultrasound and modulated visible light
(MVL).
Infrared is a type of electromagnetic radiation that is invisible
for users. The wavelength of common IR emitters is 940nm, which
makes it reflected by walls and doors rather than penetrating them.
Ultrasound is sound waves with frequencies higher than the
upper audible limit of human hearing. When ultrasound travels
through the boundary of the smart home, its intensity diminishes
with distance and the attenuation is generally proportional to the
square of sound frequency.
Modulated Visible Light (MVL). we can modulate the pulse
width of the visible light signals to make them below the human
eye’s resolution so that they are invisible for users.
4 DESIGN OF HLCAUTH PROTOCOL
Although the security properties of HLCs can efficiently prevent
smart home from various attacks, it still leaves us two questions:
1) Since numerous smart devices are resource-constrained, how
can we implement our scheme in a lightweight way? 2) Given that
local outside attackers still have chances to eavesdrop or inject over
HLCs, how can we further improve the security of communications?
To answer above questions, we propose HlcAuth, which exploits a
challenge-response mechanism and authenticates communications
