### 7. Future Work
Although our study has focused on one operational service and a testbed, we are interested in extending our research to include additional and larger services. We also plan to investigate anycast catchments and load prediction over time, and we are currently collecting the necessary data. Additionally, we aim to explore methods to improve response rates and assess whether better response rates can enhance coverage estimates. These further studies will help generalize our findings but are beyond the scope of this paper.

We are also keen on studying CDN-based anycast systems. While the fundamental mechanics of anycast remain consistent regardless of the service, different service providers may optimize routing and peering in distinct ways.

Finally, it is possible that the Round-Trip Times (RTTs) from Verfploeter measurements could be used to suggest optimal locations for new anycast sites [43], as suggested by an anonymous reviewer.

### 8. Conclusions
The primary contribution of this paper is demonstrating that Verfploeter enables the measurement of anycast catchments across millions of networks on the Internet. Verfploeter provides visibility into 430 times more network blocks than RIPE Atlas, a widely used platform for large-scale active measurements.

Such measurements are crucial for the operation of anycast services (§5.1) and become even more important as the number of anycast sites grows (§5.2). With large DNS and CDN anycast networks using hundreds or thousands of sites, comprehensive catchment mapping (§5.3) is increasingly essential, particularly since regular catchment evaluation is necessary to avoid performance issues [9, 43].

Moreover, the combination of historical traffic load and catchment mapping (§5.4) can provide a predictive tool for anycast operations (§5.5). The broad coverage of Verfploeter allows us to identify individual networks that are likely to generate significant amounts of traffic.

We have utilized Verfploeter to understand the new B-Root anycast system (§6.1), evaluate split catchments in large ASes (§6.2), and confirm prior results in anycast stability with a larger dataset (§6.3).

One data point per 15 minutes. If a vantage point (VP) stopped responding, it is counted as "to_NR"; if it started responding, it is counted as "from_NR". (Dataset: STV-3-23.)

### Table 7: Top ASes Involved in Site Flips
(Dataset: STV-3-23)

| AS | IPs (/24s) | Flips Frac. |
|---|---|---|
| 4134 CHINANET | 47,963 | 0.51 |
| 7922 COMCAST | 3,933 | 0.04 |
| 6983 ITCDELTA | 1,372 | 0.03 |
| 6739 ONO-AS | 849 | 0.03 |
| 37963 ALIBABA | 2,493 | 0.02 |
| Other | 43,388 | 0.37 |
| Total | 108,493 | 1.00 |

During the measurement period, we observed a median of 4.6k VPs (approximately 0.1%) change catchment (the blue line in Figure 9). These VPs were located within 2,809 ASes. Table 7 shows that 63% of the flipping VPs are part of only 5 ASes, and 51% are within AS 4134 (Chinanet). Catchment flips can be caused by changes in routing policies or link state, and frequent flipping can be due to load-balanced links. With flipping prominent in only a few ASes, these observations confirm our prior findings with RIPE Atlas [48], but from a larger set of vantage points: anycast instability is rare but persistent for users of certain ASes. An additional application of Verfploeter could be the identification and resolution of such instability.
