User: I have an account to a computing cluster that uses Scientific Linux. Of course I only have user access. I'm working with python and I need to run python scripts, so I need to import some python modules. Since I don't have root access, I installed a local python copy on my $HOME with all the required modules. When I run the scripts on my account (hosting node), they run correctly. But in order to submit jobs to the computing queues (to process on much faster machines), I need to submit a bash script that has a line that executes the scripts. The computing cluster uses SunGrid Engine. However when I submit the bash script, I get an error that the modules I installed can't be found! I can't figure out what is wrong. I hope if you can help.
Assistant: You could simply call your python program from the bash script with something like: PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python /path/to/my/python my_python_script 
I don't know how SunGrid works, but if it uses a different user than yours, you'll need global read access to your $HOME. Or at least to the python libraries.
