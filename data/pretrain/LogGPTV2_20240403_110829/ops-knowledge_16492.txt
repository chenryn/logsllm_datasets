To effectively implement CIS Control 15.5, "Assess Service Providers," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Align with Service Provider Management Policy**: Ensure that the assessment of service providers is consistent with the organization's established service provider management policy. This policy should define the criteria and processes for evaluating and managing service providers.

2. **Determine Assessment Scope**: The scope of the assessment may vary based on the classification of the service provider and the services they offer. Consider the criticality and sensitivity of the data and systems involved. 

3. **Review Standardized Assessment Reports**: Utilize standardized assessment reports such as Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) and Payment Card Industry (PCI) Attestation of Compliance (AoC). These reports provide a structured and recognized method for evaluating the security and compliance of service providers.

4. **Use Customized Questionnaires**: In addition to standardized reports, organizations can use customized questionnaires tailored to their specific needs and requirements. This ensures that all relevant aspects of the service provider’s operations are thoroughly evaluated.

5. **Implement Rigorous Assessment Processes**: Employ other appropriately rigorous processes to assess service providers, such as on-site audits, interviews, or third-party evaluations. These methods can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the service provider’s security posture.

6. **Conduct Regular Reassessments**: Reassess service providers at least annually, or whenever there are new or renewed contracts. Regular reassessments help ensure that the service provider continues to meet the organization’s security and compliance standards.

7. **Identify Security Function**: Note that CIS Control 15.5 is categorized under the "Identify" function within the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This function focuses on developing an organizational understanding of cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.

By following these procedures, an organization can effectively manage and mitigate the risks associated with using external service providers.
