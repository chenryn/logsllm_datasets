### Title: BlackHat US-22: BrokenMesh - New Attack Surfaces in Bluetooth Mesh

**Abstract:**

Bluetooth Mesh is a mesh networking standard based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), introduced by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) in 2017. This protocol facilitates many-to-many device communications and is optimized for large-scale device networks, making it ideal for smart homes, industrial deployments, and other IoT applications. Despite its widespread adoption and support from major chip manufacturers, the security of Bluetooth Mesh implementations has not received adequate attention.

In this presentation, we delve into the Bluetooth Mesh protocol, dividing the mesh process into two key stages: network build and network control. We focus on the security implications of these stages and present an automated fuzzing tool, "BLE Mesh Fuzzer," designed to test both phases. Our evaluation of this tool on eight well-known vendors and open-source projects uncovered 17 memory corruption vulnerabilities, resulting in nine Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Some of these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution without user interaction, potentially causing the entire mesh network to be compromised, affecting millions of IoT devices.

Additionally, we examined the security of protocol wrapper applications and identified ten vulnerabilities in a prominent vendor's implementation, leading to ten CVEs. These vulnerabilities could result in serious consequences, such as privilege escalation.

**Presentation Outline:**
