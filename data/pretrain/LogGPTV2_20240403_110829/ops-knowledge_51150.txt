User: I'm taking a python course, I save exercise scripts in /this/is/where/I save/exercises/exercise.py.
Now whenever I type python in terminal it immediately gives me this:
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/this/is/where/I save/exercises/exercise.py'
I know it's not found since I deleted the file. But why is python running that script whenever it runs? It's annoying.
INFO
Linux OS
Python2 and Python3 both show same error
Assistant: Thanks, @JoranBeasley, @barunsthakur, @PadraicCunningham, and all.
I had PYTHONSTARTUP set in .bashrc.
May help forgetful people in the future.
