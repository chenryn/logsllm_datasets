Question: "In the development of an Android mobile application, you are evaluating the use of cryptographic APIs for securing sensitive data. What is a critical factor to consider when implementing cryptographic operations to ensure data security?"
 "A": "Cryptographic operations should be performed on the client-side to reduce server load and improve performance."
 "B": "Cryptographic operations must be offloaded to third-party libraries without reviewing their source code or security posture."
 "C": "Cryptographic primitives from reputable and up-to-date libraries should be used instead of creating custom encryption methods."
 "D": "Using deprecated cryptographic APIs as they are well-understood and have extensive historical usage data."
Answer: C
