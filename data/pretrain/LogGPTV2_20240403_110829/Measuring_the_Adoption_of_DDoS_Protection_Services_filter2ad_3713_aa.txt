## Abstract

Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade, with their intensity ranging from minor nuisances to severe disruptions. The rise in the number of attacks, coupled with significant financial losses for the targets, has led to the emergence of a market for DDoS Protection Service (DPS) providers. These services allow victims to outsource the mitigation of malicious traffic through traffic diversion.

In this paper, we investigate the global adoption of cloud-based DPSs, focusing on nine leading providers. Our analysis is based on active DNS measurements, which enable us to determine if traffic diversion to a DPS is in effect for a given domain name. We also distinguish between various methods of traffic diversion and protection. Our dataset, covering more than 50% of all names in the global domain namespace, includes daily snapshots over a period of 1.5 years.

Our results show that DPS adoption has increased by 1.24× during our measurement period, a significant trend compared to the overall expansion of the namespace. Additionally, our study reveals that adoption is often driven by large entities such as major web hosting companies, which can activate or deactivate DDoS protection for millions of domain names simultaneously.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as a simple yet highly effective form of cyberattack. These attacks can generate traffic volumes in the range of hundreds of Gbps, as seen in high-profile incidents like the Spamhaus attack in 2013 [2] and the BBC attack in 2016 [3]. Furthermore, on-demand DDoS attacks can be easily purchased online for as little as a few USD [4, 5], contributing to their growing popularity.

The increase in the number of DDoS attacks, combined with the significant financial impact on targets, has led to the development of a market for DDoS Protection Service (DPS) providers. These services can protect specific applications or entire networks by either deploying dedicated on-site appliances [7] or using cloud-based solutions, where malicious traffic is filtered or absorbed. Hybrid solutions, combining on-site and cloud-based components, are also available. DDoS attacks can be volumetric, saturating the target's bandwidth, or semantic, denying service access with minimal bandwidth effects.

Traffic diversion is a key mechanism in DDoS protection, allowing traffic to be routed through the DPS infrastructure either continuously or on-demand. For applications accessed via domain names, the Domain Name System (DNS) can be used to divert traffic, similar to how content delivery networks implement load balancing [8, 9]. Alternatively, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to redirect traffic towards the DPS infrastructure.

In this paper, we examine the global adoption of cloud-based DPSs, focusing on nine leading providers: Akamai, CenturyLink, CloudFlare, DOSarrest, F5 Networks, Incapsula, Level 3, Neustar, and Verisign. Our investigation is based on long-term, active DNS measurements, which allow us to verify if traffic diversion to a DPS is in place for a given domain name. Our dataset includes daily measurements over a period of 1.5 years, covering the .com, .net, and .org zones, which contain about 50% of all domain names globally [10]. It also includes six months of data for the .nl zone and domain names on the Alexa Top 1M list [1].

Our study not only confirms the increasing adoption of DPSs but also shows a 1.24× growth in the zones we studied over 1.5 years, compared to an overall growth of 1.09× in these zones. Additionally, our results indicate that adoption trends are driven by large entities such as major web hosting companies, which can activate or deactivate DDoS protection for millions of domain names at once.

We explain the various traffic diversion approaches in Section 2, describe our measurement and analysis methodology in Section 3, and present and discuss our findings in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5.

## 2. DDoS Protection Services

DPS providers offer cloud-based, in-line, or hybrid solutions, depending on the type of attack (volumetric or semantic) and the customer's requirements. For example, an ISP may need BGP-based protection for an entire network, while the owner of a popular website might only need to divert traffic to a single host. Banks, for instance, may require a hybrid solution where an in-line appliance mitigates semantic attacks, and the cloud handles large volumetric attacks. For all but strictly in-line solutions, traffic diversion is necessary.

### 2.1 DNS-based Network Traffic Diversion

DNS can be used in several ways to divert network traffic, provided the asset to be protected is accessed via a domain name:

- **Address Record (A Record):** The owner of a domain name can set an A record to a DPS-assigned IP address. For example, the domain `www.examp.le` can be configured to point to the IP address `10.0.0.1` assigned by the DPS.
  
  ```plaintext
  ;; ANSWER SECTION:
  www.examp.le. IN A 10.0.0.1
  ```

- **Canonical Name (CNAME Record):** A domain name can be made an alias for another domain name using a CNAME record. If the CNAME record of `x` references the canonical name `y`, then the DNS records for `x` are determined by the DNS zone of `y`. In the example below, `www.examp.le` is an alias for `foob.ar`, and the DPS controls the authoritative name server for `foob.ar`.

  ```plaintext
  ;; ANSWER SECTION:
  www.examp.le. IN CNAME foob.ar.
  foob.ar. IN A 10.0.0.2
  ```

- **Name Server (NS Record):** The DNS zone of a domain can be delegated to a name server controlled by a DPS. This allows the DPS to change the address records of the protected domain. In the example below, the name server `ns.foob.ar` is authoritative for `www.examp.le`.

  ```plaintext
  ;; ANSWER SECTION:
  www.examp.le. IN NS ns.foob.ar.
  ```

  The difference between the CNAME and NS cases is that the latter gives the DPS full control over the DNS records of the protected domain. In the CNAME example, the DPS-controlled `ns.foob.ar` is not authoritative for `www.examp.le`, so it cannot change any of its records directly, even though it can affect IP address records through the CNAME's expansion.

  Many DPS providers combine DNS-based diversion with a reverse proxy. In this setup, web content is pulled from the customer by forwarding the request, and the response is served from within the DPS infrastructure. The customer should drop requests not made by the DPS to prevent direct attacks that bypass DNS.

### 2.2 BGP Prefix Announcements

BGP can be used to divert network traffic to a DPS. This requires the DPS to announce an IP subnet of its customer, such as a /24. All traffic destined for the customer's subnet is then routed to the DPS infrastructure for scrubbing. After scrubbing, the traffic is sent back to the customer's network using, for example, a Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel. BGP-based diversion is typically used to protect entire networks or when a reverse proxy is not feasible.

### 2.3 Moment of Mitigation

Traffic diversion can be done in an on-demand or always-on manner. 

- **Always-On DDoS Protection:** Traffic is always routed to the DPS infrastructure, even if the customer is not under attack. For DNS-based diversion, an address lookup always results in an IP address that routes to the DPS. In the BGP case, the DPS will never withdraw the customer’s IP subnet announcement.

- **On-Demand DDoS Protection:** A DNS change is made by either the provider or the customer, or the DPS starts announcing a customer’s IP prefix using BGP. For DNS-based diversion, the domain owner changes the address records from an IP address that does not route to the DPS to a DPS-assigned IP address. Multiple address records may need to be changed if the domain has more than one.
