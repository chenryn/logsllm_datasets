### 4. Performance Evaluation

To highlight that Content Delivery Systems (CDSs) do not necessarily optimize their DNS load balancing strategies to maximize user performance, and to demonstrate the potential of application-ISP collaboration enabled by PaDIS, we conducted extensive active measurements.

#### 4.1. Measurement Setup

We used ten vantage points within the ISP at residential locations, with DSL connectivity. The downstream bandwidth ranged from 1 Mbps to 25 Mbps, while the upstream ranged from 0.128 Mbps to 5 Mbps. The measurements started on May 1, 2010, and lasted for 14 days. Each client accessed the selected services 24 times per day. Additionally, we performed DNS queries for the hostnames to determine the IP addresses recommended by the service. This methodology allowed us to understand possible end-user performance improvements and estimate network distances and savings.

#### 4.2. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

Using the data sets from the residential ISP, we identified the two most popular CDNs, referred to as CDN1 and CDN2, which are responsible for approximately 20% of all HTTP traffic. We identified more than 3,500 unique IP addresses for CDN1 and more than 700 for CDN2. Both CDNs have more than 300 cache IP addresses within the ISP.

##### 4.2.1. Cache Diversity and Path Diversity

After augmenting each identified CDN IP address with its network path information, we found that the cache diversity translates into both cache subnet diversity and path diversity. This suggests that PaDIS can potentially take advantage of both server and path diversity. However, it remains unclear whether PaDIS can improve the optimization of the CDN in terms of client download time and/or the number of hops traversed within the ISP.

##### 4.2.2. Bypassing CDN Recommendations

Recent studies have shown that any CDNized object is accessible from an arbitrary cache. Therefore, we requested the URL directly from each identified CDN cache IP address, regardless of their location. We verified this for all caches of CDN1. Additionally, CDN1 caches serve content of domains that only use their load balancing or DNS service, similar to how content is delivered by CDN1.

However, CDN2 is more restrictive. Our measurements showed that CDN2 caches only reply to requests from the same region. For example, European caches served content to our European clients, but North American caches refused to deliver content to these clients.

##### 4.2.3. File Size and Performance

The download performance of web pages may depend on the size of the object. We selected ten different files for CDN1 and seven for CDN2, ranging from 36 KB to 17 MB (see Table 3). To repeat the measurements multiple times during a small time period without overwhelming the client DSL lines, we subsampled the number of caches. For CDN1, we randomly selected one cache from each subnet, reducing the number of caches to 124. For CDN2, we found five subnets containing caches, but only two answered our queries with the requested data. We excluded the domain name resolution time for the CDN-recommended download.

#### 4.3. Results

Figures 11 and 12 show boxplots of the object retrieval time on a typical day (May 12th) for a subset of the objects and one specific client. The results from other clients and other objects were similar throughout the experiment.

**Figure 11: CDN1 Performance Evaluation**
- Boxplot of file downloads for the caches across time for objects 01, 06, and 10.
- The box stretches from the 25th to the 75th percentile.
- The line within the box corresponds to the 50th percentile (median).
- The whiskers represent the lowest and highest datum within 1.5 times the interquartile range.
- Dashed lines with triangles indicate the download time for the recommended cache by the CDN.
- Solid lines with squares indicate the download time for the cache ranked highest by PaDIS based on delay.

**Figure 12: CDN2 Performance Evaluation**
- Boxplot of file downloads for the caches across time for objects 01, 04, and 06.
- Similar to Figure 11, with the same boxplot elements.

**Observations:**
- The download time for the recommended caches by CDN1 and CDN2 is generally good and close to the median download time over all caches.
- There is significant room for improvement, especially during peak hours.
- PaDIS is able to improve the download time by up to a factor of four.

### Conclusion

The response time variance was minimal, and the software ran stably throughout all experiments. We also repeated the experiment with heavy hitter detection activated, maintaining a list of the top ten replies, aggregated every ten seconds. These were then fed into the ranking function. Our results show that both the number of requests served by PaDIS and the average response time decreased only slightly.

This evaluation highlights the potential benefits of using PaDIS to improve content delivery performance, particularly in scenarios where traditional CDN recommendations may not be optimal.
