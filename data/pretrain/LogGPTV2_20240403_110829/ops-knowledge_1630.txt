To use Google App Engine, you need Python 2.5. However, Ubuntu 10.10 comes with Python 2.6.6 pre-installed, and you do not want to interfere with the system's default Python version. As a result, you have downloaded and compiled Python 2.5 in your home directory.

Next, you downloaded Django-1.2.5.tar.gz and ran `sudo python setup.py install`. Unfortunately, when you try to import Django, you encounter an "ImportError: No module named django". It seems that Django was installed for the system's Python 2.6.6, rather than your local Python 2.5 installation.

**Solution:**

1. **Install Python 2.5 via Synaptic (if available):**
   - If Python 2.5 is available in the package repository, you can install it using Synaptic.
   - Once Python 2.5 is installed, you can use `easy_install-2.5` to install Django specifically for Python 2.5.

2. **Manually Install Django for Python 2.5:**
   - If Python 2.5 is not available in the package repository, you can manually install Django for your local Python 2.5 installation.
   - First, navigate to the directory where you have Django-1.2.5.tar.gz.
   - Extract the tarball:
     ```sh
     tar -xzf Django-1.2.5.tar.gz
     ```
   - Navigate to the extracted directory:
     ```sh
     cd Django-1.2.5
     ```
   - Use the Python 2.5 interpreter to install Django:
     ```sh
     /path/to/your/python2.5 setup.py install
     ```

3. **Verify the Installation:**
   - To ensure Django is installed correctly, you can check the `sys.path` of your Python 2.5 installation:
     ```sh
     /path/to/your/python2.5
     >>> import sys
     >>> print(sys.path)
     ```
   - This will display the list of directories Python searches for modules. Ensure that the directory where Django is installed is included in this list.

By following these steps, you should be able to install and use Django with your local Python 2.5 installation without interfering with the system's Python 2.6.6.
