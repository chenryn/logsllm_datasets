User: AppEngine needs Python2.5.
Ubuntu 2010.10 comes with Python 2.6.6 and I didn't want to interfere with it, so I downloaded and compiled Python 2.5 in my home directory.
Then I downloaded Django-1.2.5.tar.gz, and ran "sudo python setup.py install". 
Problem: "import django" says "ImportError: No module named django"
I guess django got installed to the system's Python2.6.6, how to install it into my local Python2.5 directory?
Assistant: Install python2.5 with synaptic, then you will be able to use easy_install2.5 to install django. If you don't have the python2.5 in your package list you can put django on your python2.5 system path and be with it
to view the system path do:

python2.5 
  import sys
  sys.path
