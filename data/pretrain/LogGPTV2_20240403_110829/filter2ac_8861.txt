### Title: efiXplorer: Hunting for UEFI Firmware Vulnerabilities at Scale with Automated Static Analysis

**Abstract:**

Current UEFI analysis tools lack a systematic approach to firmware vulnerability research, particularly for x86-based systems. There are no publicly available tools that focus on static analysis for UEFI firmware vulnerabilities. Most common reverse engineering tools simplify certain reconstruction routines but fail to provide a comprehensive view based on the firmware image. Previous research in this area has primarily focused on misconfiguration issues, such as Secure Boot not being enabled or unauthenticated firmware updates.

In this talk, we introduce a novel vulnerability research approach using automated static analysis. Our tool, efiXplorer, is designed to identify vulnerable code patterns in UEFI firmware. The efiXplorer plugin reconstructs key elements and data types, such as EFI protocols, and establishes cross-references by analyzing the entire firmware image. This reconstruction is crucial for UEFI reverse engineering, as it helps in identifying complex issues like SMM (Intel System Management Mode) callouts, where a pointer references an unvalidated buffer in untrusted memory (e.g., NVRAM, ACPI) controlled by an attacker.

**Key Features of efiXplorer:**

- **Comprehensive Reconstruction:** efiXplorer reconstructs essential elements and data types, providing valuable cross-references for UEFI reverse engineering.
- **Open-Source Plugin:** efiXplorer is the most comprehensive open-source IDA plugin for UEFI reverse engineering. It was recently open-sourced, and ongoing development focuses on enhancing its capabilities for vulnerability research.
- **Vulnerability Discovery:** The plugin has already identified multiple previously unreported vulnerabilities in recent hardware platforms from major vendors, including ASUS, ASRock, MSI, Gigabyte, Lenovo, and others.

**Presentation Highlights:**

- **Introduction to efiXplorer:** We will present the efiXplorer plugin and its unique approach to static analysis.
- **Case Studies:** We will discuss real-world examples of vulnerabilities discovered using efiXplorer.
- **New Version Release:** During the briefing, we will release a new version of the plugin with enhanced functionality to detect the classes of issues discussed in the talk.

By leveraging efiXplorer, researchers can more effectively identify and mitigate UEFI firmware vulnerabilities, contributing to the overall security of x86-based systems.
