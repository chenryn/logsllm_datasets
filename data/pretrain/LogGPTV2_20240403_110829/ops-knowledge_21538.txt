Question: "Given a code snippet for an HMAC engine that processes messages using SHA-256, but only for messages up to 512 bits in length, which of the following steps, if implemented, would complete the HMAC engine to handle messages of arbitrary length?"
 "A": "Implementing an iterative function to break up a message into blocks of a fixed size."
 "B": "Increasing the size of the 'bigData' variable to support larger messages."
 "C": "Adding a random number generator to provide entropy for each message block."
 "D": "Changing the SHA-256 module to a SHA-512 module for increased security."
Answer: A
