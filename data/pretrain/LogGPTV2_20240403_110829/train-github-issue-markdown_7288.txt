When using native networking in in AWS (i.e. with options `cloud-
provider=aws`, `cluster-name=`, `allocate-node-cidrs=true`,
`cluster-cidr=`, `configure-cbr0=true`, `bridge=cbr0`,
`iptables=false`, and `ip-msq=false` as appropriate to `kube-apiserve`r,
`kube-controller-manager`, `kubelet`, and `docker`), everything works except
that Pods, including kube-dns, can't make DNS queries to the Amazon provided
DNS server in the subnet. That means Pods can't resolve external hostnames.
It appears that the Amazon provided DNS server won't respond to queries with
an address other than one within the subnet. The solution to the problem is to
masquerade traffic from the Pod network to the Amazon provided DNS server in
the subnet.
`sudo iptables --table nat -A POSTROUTING -s  -d /32 -j
MASQUERADE`
Arguably this should be done by `kubelet`when it is passed the `configure-
cbr0` option alongside the `cloud-provider=aws` option.
