  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: Ubuntu 15.10 x64
Steps to Reproduce:
  *     1. Define a variable in a Javascript/Typescript file and assign a multi-line string value, using the "" (backslash) character to join lines. e.g.
    var mlString = "The is my long multi-line string which I am using a backslash \
                    to join over these lines."
  *     2. In the vscode editor only the first line of the string is correctly color-coded as a string-type. See screenshot attached.
