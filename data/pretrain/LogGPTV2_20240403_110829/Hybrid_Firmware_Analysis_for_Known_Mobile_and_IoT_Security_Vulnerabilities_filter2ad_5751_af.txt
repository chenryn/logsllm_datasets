### Evaluation of PATCHECKO's Accuracy

In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of PATCHECKOâ€™s deep learning model, dynamic analysis engine, and its patch detection capabilities.

#### Deep Learning Model

**Training and Accuracy:**
- **Figure 8** illustrates the accuracy and loss during the training of our deep learning model over approximately 15 hours. The model achieves an accuracy of up to 96%.

**Similarity Checking:**
- Previous similarity checking solutions, as described in [42], rely on the availability of the symbol table to locate the target function. If the symbol table is not available, these methods may fail to identify the target function, especially if the vulnerable and patched versions are not similar.
- To validate this, we used our deep learning model to check the similarity between the vulnerable and patched versions of the same function for 25 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Our findings indicate that there is a possibility that the vulnerable and patched versions may not be similar based on the deep learning model.
- For example, in the case of CVE-2018-9345, if the function had been patched, the solution in [42] would likely miss the target function due to dissimilar features, leading to incorrect patch detection.

**Detection Accuracy:**
- We applied the trained model to detect 25 CVEs in Android Things and Google Pixel 2 XL. The average detection accuracy was more than 93%.
- **Figure 7** shows the false positive rates when testing the vulnerable and patched versions in the firmware images of the two devices. Notably, the false positive rates for CVE-2017-13209 and CVE-2018-9412 differ significantly between the two devices, highlighting the dissimilarity in their results.
