### Acupuncture Planning by Design

**Abstract:**
This article examines two design school initiatives that co-created sustainable living scenarios with the communities of Paris-Saclay Campus in France and Liège Saint-Gilles neighborhood in Belgium. The study explores how these design-led approaches can renew traditional urban planning methods by:
- Conducting in-depth micro-investigations into the social fabric to complement macro-level urban planning.
- Focusing on local usage patterns to identify promising practices and emerging positive signals that may not be apparent in mainstream trends.
- Immersing local stakeholders in the process, enabling them to co-produce future projections with the support of design students.
- Producing a vision of sustainable and inclusive living through a bottom-up, participatory process that aggregates numerous local projections.

The article further discusses how this new, design-led approach, based on user-oriented simulations, tangible vision-based deliberation, and a bottom-up, action-oriented "acupuncture" of micro-projects, can transform the governance of territorial development. This approach aims to highlight and support local, bottom-up initiatives and provide an enabling context for their growth.

### 1. Introduction
How can we create urbanity by combining bottom-up, citizen-led approaches with top-down urban planning? How can scenarios based on a mosaic of micro-collaborative public services generate new models of sustainable living in the city?

Drawing from two recent experiences where design schools co-created sustainable living scenarios with the populations of Paris-Saclay Campus in France and Liège Saint-Gilles neighborhood in Belgium, this article explores how bottom-up visioning and action-oriented acupuncture of micro-projects can renew the governance of territorial development. These approaches aim to foster the co-creation of public services and a governance posture that supports and backs up bottom-up initiatives. A brief illustrated presentation of the different courses will introduce the students' experiences and achievements in both local contexts. The second part will analyze the two experiences in parallel, presenting lessons learned in terms of collaboration between designers and urban developers and the broader implications for local policy-making.

#### 1.1 Sustainable Campus Paris-Saclay, France
Design students from ENSCI Paris DESIS Lab collaborated with the Etablissement Public Paris-Saclay (EPPS) to explore local development scenarios based on collaborative services that bridge social and public innovations. The suburban area of Saclay, located 20 kilometers southwest of Paris, has been chosen to host a high-level R&D campus with universities, research labs, and high-tech companies. This top-down development project expects 30,000 researchers and 40,000 students, along with related infrastructures, to settle in what is currently a mix of agricultural land and suburb.

Over a three-month period, a group of eight students explored current initiatives, identified potential contributions from participating actors, and co-developed scenarios focusing on sustainable living, quality of life, integration, and collaboration within the new mixed population. The fieldwork included a week-long immersion with local stakeholders such as research labs, high-tech companies, university schools, neighborhood associations, non-profits, and the EPPS local development agency. Students also stayed with local residents through couch surfing, engaging more deeply with the community.

Squatting working sessions were organized with stakeholders, allowing for free exchanges followed by scenario development. The aim was to enhance immersion, making the students feel like colleagues rather than just guests. The final outcomes included 16 micro-scenarios presented through short video-sketches, depicting sustainable and inclusive innovations, key places, daily ways of living, and promising areas of collaborative services. These scenarios were posted on the course web platform for feedback from participants.

#### 1.2 Diffused Campus in Saint-Gilles, Liège, Belgium
Design students from ENSAV La Cambre in Brussels collaborated with REcentre’s Sustainability at School project in Saint-Gilles, a popular neighborhood in Liège. The project leveraged the unique characteristic of Saint-Gilles, which hosts over 30 schools and 10,000 students in a relatively small central urban area with only 5,000 inhabitants.

The core idea was to explore Saint-Gilles as a "Diffused Campus" to build a new identity, strengthen the social fabric between students and other inhabitants, and improve local living and sustainability. Unlike a traditional university campus, this diffused campus integrates educational institutions into the urban fabric, with students and inhabitants mixing together.

Students explored the neighborhood, met with institutional representatives, and interviewed local residents. The group of 15 students was hosted by ID Campus, a spin-off project of the HEC-ULg University of Business Management, aimed at stimulating economic and entrepreneurial initiatives in Saint-Gilles. The students developed collaborative services, such as mutual help bicycle repair, organic vegetable basket home delivery, student adoption by resident families, and mini-job platforms.

One example, "J’irai laver chez vous" (I will do my laundry at your home), addresses the issue of students without washing machines. Signs on windows indicate whether a washing machine is available, and students can offer to do chores in exchange for using the machine. Additionally, a range of services in the public space, such as "Urban Playground," was developed to support the concept of a diffused campus, turning public spaces into interactive and playful environments.

### 2. Co-Creation of a Localized Sustainable Living Vision
Both the "Sustainable Campus Paris-Saclay" and "Saint-Gilles Diffused Campus" projects are based on similar approaches and tools. This section characterizes these approaches, highlighting their opportunities and limitations.

#### 2.1 In-Depth Investigation
A key characteristic of the approach used in both projects is an in-depth investigation into the social fabric of the place, with a limited scope to cover large portions of the territory or a large number of people. This approach raised debates with EPPS, as urban planners argued that a small, sample-limited approach might neglect significant variations in geography, sociology, and economy across a large territory.

However, the in-depth approach aims to enrich and color a larger, structural planning approach with specific concerns from different populations, explicit local logics, and raise awareness of emerging expectations and opportunities. For instance, in both contexts, historical and newly arrived populations initially appeared in conflict. However, deeper engagement revealed points of convergence, such as shared cultural events and mutual support.

#### 2.2 (Re)starting from People and Usages
Another key characteristic is the focus on people as the starting point for investigating the place and projecting the future vision. This approach is not primarily ethical or marketing-driven but focuses on the basic usages of spaces and services.

In Paris-Saclay, the urban planner pointed out that a metro station and new city center would not necessarily create urbanity. Both Paris-Saclay and Saint-Gilles are ambivalent territories with the potential to become "non-places" or interesting hybrid spaces. The overall concept for Saint-Gilles builds on its assets, viewing it as a diffused campus based on social inclusion. Similarly, Paris-Saclay has the potential to be a living lab for a sustainable society, combining ecological sensitivity with high-tech innovation.

These visions of a "campus-neighborhood" and an "advanced green city" emerged from the interactions between design students and the local populations. Promising practices and emerging initiatives exist in the social fabric of both territories, requiring careful observation at the human scale to detect these positive signals.
