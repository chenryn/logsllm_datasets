ACUPUNCTURE PLANNING BY DESIGN
François Jégou, Clara Delétraz, Giovanna Massoni, Jean-Baptiste Roussat, Marie Coirié
ABSTRACT
In the light of two experiences of design schools engaging in co-creating sustainable living scenarios with 
the population of Paris-Saclay Campus in France and Liège Saint-Gilles neighbourhood in Belgium, the article 
discusses both experimentations and question how design schools approaches may renew the ways local urban 
planning is usually conducted: 
In-depth micro-investigation into the social fabric to inspire and complete macro urban planning approach; (re)
starting from usage approaches to detect hardly visible local promising practices and emerging positive signals 
opposed to mainstream trends; immerging at local stakeholders place and enabling them to co-producing 
future projections with the support of the design students; production of a vision of sustainable and inclusive 
living on the territory through a particular and intrinsically bottom-up process based on the aggregation of a 
large number of single local projections.
The article then discusses how this new design-leaded approach based on explicit user-oriented simulations, 
tangible vision-based deliberation and a bottom-up visioning and action-oriented acupuncture of micro-
projects can renew the governance of territorial development towards new roles of giving visibility to local 
bottom-up promising initiatives and adopting a backup posture to provide an enabling context for their 
development.

1.  INTRODUCTION
How can we produce urbanity combining bottom-up 
citizen-lead approaches on usages with top-down 
urban planning? 
How scenarios based on a mosaic of micro-
collaborative public services can generate new models 
of sustainable living in the city?
In the light of two recent experiences of design 
schools engaging in co-creating sustainable living 
scenarios with the population of Paris-Saclay Campus 
in France and Liège Saint-Gilles neighborhood in 
Belgium, the article will discuss how these new 
approaches based on bottom-up visioning and action-
oriented acupuncture of micro-projects can renew the 
governance of territorial development towards co-
creation of public services and a governance posture 
that enable and backup bottom-up initiatives. A short 
illustrated presentation of the different courses will 
introduce students’ experiences and achievements on 
both local contexts. A second part will analyse the two 
experiences in parallel and present the lessons learn 
both in terms of collaboration between designers 
and urban developers and more broadly in terms of 
consequences for local policy making.
1.1 Sustainable Campus Paris-Saclay, France
Design Students of ENSCI Paris DESIS Lab from Ecole 
Nationale Supérieure de Création Industrilelle, Les 
Ateliers in Paris collaborate with the Etablissement 
Public Paris-Saclay (Paris-Saclay development agency) 
and explore scenarios of local development based 
on collaborative services bridging social innovations 
and public innovations. The suburban area of Saclay, 
20 kilometres South-West from Paris has been 
chosen in France to host a high level R&D Campus 
with universities, research labs, high-tech companies, 
etc… This top-down development project expects 
30 000 researchers and 40 000 students and related 
infrastructures to settle down in what is now a mix of 
agricultural land and suburb, to work and live there or 
commute from Paris. 
The course involved a group of 8 students over a 
period of 3 months. The students explores current 
initiatives developed on the field, potentials brought 
by the participating actors and co-develop with them 
scenarios focusing sustainable way of living, quality of 
life, integration and collaboration within the new mix 
of populations. 
The field work was based on a week long immersion 
with a sample of local stakeholders such as research 
labs, high tech companies, university levels schools, 
neighborhood associations, non profits working in the 
area of territorial development and the EPPS local 
development agency. Student and staff organized also 
lodging through couch surfing spreading the group 
at inhabitant homes for the nights engaging more 
in-depth with the local population as part of the 
immersion posture.
Squatting working sessions have been organized with 
stakeholders at their place for a moment of free 
ENSCI students collaborating with urban planners at EPPS Paris Saclays development agency.

exchanges first followed by scenario development to 
directly co-develop the scenarios video-sketches with 
the hosts. The aim of squatting was again to accentuate 
the immersion within each institution: more than 
interviews, group discussions or working meeting the 
fact of settling in a place, booking a room for a day or 
so, having lunch and informal coffee pauses with them, 
invading in a way the place intends that the group of 
students is more considered as colleagues for a day by 
the population fro the hosting place rather than just 
guests.
Scenarios focusing sustainable way of living, quality 
of life, integration and collaboration within the new 
mix of populations emerged and were finalized after 
the immersion week and posted on the course web 
platform (www.sustainable-everyday-project.net/
ensciparisdesislab). Participants from the institutions 
where the squatting working sessions took place were 
invited to react and fine-tune the scenarios online.
The final outcomes is constituted by 16 micro-scenarios 
presented through short video-sketches mimicking 
a journalist reporting in 2030 about sustainable 
and inclusive innovations, key places, daily ways of 
living, and promising areas of collaborative services 
exploring synergies between top-down enabling public 
infrastructures and bottom-up social initiatives.
1.2 Diffused Campus in Saint-Gilles, Liege, Belgium
Design Students of the ENSAV La Cambre in 
Brussels collaborate with REcentre’s Sustainability 
at School project Welcome to Saint-Gilles a popular 
141
neighbourhood in Liege. The action research 
project proposes to leverage on an original specificity 
of Saint-Gilles: this relatively small central urban 
area in a secondary medium-size town of Belgium is 
hosting more than 30 schools from infants-schools to 
universities and counts more than 10 000 students for 
only 5 000 inhabitants. 
The core idea emerging from the course is to explore 
Saint-Gilles as a Diffused Campus in order both to build 
a new identity of the neighbourhood, to strengthen the 
social fabric between students studying there and 
other inhabitants and improve both quality of 
local living and sustainability in the neighbourhood. 
A Diffused Campus is meant to be a campus due to 
the density of schools in the area. But contrary to a 
classical university campus as it can be seen all over 
the world, this hypothetic campus is not a dedicated 
place where only buildings and equipments for 
education are concentrated. Saint-Gilles Campus 
is diffused in the urban fabric and students and 
inhabitants are mixing together. 
Students explores Saint-Gilles neighbourhood, meet 
representative of the institutions of the area, and 
interviews inhabitants at their place. The group of 15 
students was hosted by ID Campus a spin-off project 
of the HEC-ULg University of Business Management 
of Liège and oriented to the dynamization and 
stimulation of economic and entrepreneurial initiatives 
in Saint-Gilles were the university is based. Students 
were engaged to develop first collaborative services 
(Jégou, Manzini, 2008) intended as rather informal 
services co-produced by the local population that is 
likely to use them and benefit from them. The aim was 
to refurbish the social fabric between inhabitants and 
students providing reasons for collaboration, exchange 
and mutual help.
Students present scenarios of the collaborative 
services they imagine in collaboration with the 
inhabitants and the students through short video-
sketches: mutual help bicycles repair; organic 
vegetable basket home delivery, students adoption by 
inhabitant families, mini-job and help platform, etc.
J’irai laver chez vous (I will do my laundry at your home) 
is one of the collaborative services scenario dealing 
with students not having a washing machine and 
going to Laundromats. 
What a waste of time waiting there! Next door your 
neighbours has probably got a washing machine 
that you could use. Signs on windows show whether 
or not the machine is available to use or not. If it is, 
then knock at the door and see what you can do in 
exchange for your laundry, maybe you could go get 
some groceries, do some gardening or whatever might

be helping the one helping you. Save money, energy 
and meet the people who are living around you.
A second range of services in the public space 
has been developed in parallel to support the 
instantiation of the concept of diffused campus in the 
neighbourhood. 
Urban Playground for instance is an example of service 
in the public space that supports the idea of diffused 
campus playing on the idea that if the neighbourhood 
is a campus then the public space should recall an 
urban playground.
Every corner of a street, every bus station, every 
sidewalk could be an opportunity to play: quiz and 
riddles on walls, swing in waiting places, labyrinth 
on walking paths, trash cans to through away from a 
certain distance, hopscotch, etc.
Finally a very basic visual identity has been developed 
to capture the new identity of Saint-Gilles as a diffused 
campus. It is based on the image of a map of the 
neighbourhood with spots localizing all and every 
collaborative services imagined by the students.  
2. CO-CREATION OF A LOCALIZED SUSTAINABLE 
LIVING VISION
Both experiences of ‘Sustainable Campus Paris-
Saclay’ in France and ‘Saint-Gilles Diffused Campus’ in 
Belgium are based on the same approaches and tools. 
This first part intends to characterize these approaches 
and point their opportunities and limits.
2.1 In-depth investigation
The first characteristic of the approach carried out 
with both schools is to be an in-depth investigation 
into the social fabric of the place with a rather limited 
capability to embrace large portion of the territory 
or to take into consideration important numbers of 
persons in the population. 
This posture right away raised a debate with EPPS 
when setting up the investigation programme for 
the ENSCI Paris DESIS Lab: with a small number of 
students, the hypothesis was to choose a small portion 
of the territory as emblematic as possible of the issues 
and concerns already identified for the emerging 
Paris-Saclay Campus and to settle there for a week 
143
in immersion, meeting and working with groups of 
researchers and employees of some institutions, coach-
surfing at inhabitants to share and better understand 
there daily living. 
For urban planners this hypotheses was a complete 
non-sense: pretending to do anything meaningful over 
a territory nearly as large as a region only concentrating 
over a short period on a small part of it means to 
neglect fundamental variations in terms of geography, 
sociology and economy of such a large territory. 
In-depth but sample-limited approach is opposed 
here to exhaustive but superficial overview. Beyond, 
this opposition in terms of posture, the aims of 
the approaches are slightly different. The in-depth 
approach neither pretends to apprehend the territory 
nor to give the appropriate information to take a 
coherent action. Its aim is more to enrich and colour 
a large and structural planning approach with specific 
concerns from the different populations, to explicit 
local logics and sometimes to raise awareness on 
emerging expectations of opportunities. For instance, 
in both contexts the populations historically living 
in Saclay area and in Saint-Gilles neighbourhood 
appears in potential conflict with the newly arrived 
populations, provoking a massive invasion of the place 
and reason for its brutal transformation. At superficial 
level, only potential conflicts appear. Looking more 
in-depth, exchanging with the populations beyond 
the potential conflicts allows to identify emerging 
points of convergence: the institutions like schools 
and universities are generating a rich cultural life 
with conferences and events, sport equipments the 
Saclay population is potentially interested in sharing; 
the aging population of Saint-Gilles reveals to have 
time and to be able to provide family-like support to 
exchange with students in a mutual help perspective.
The in-depth micro-investigation of the territory is 
therefore more oriented to generate insights and 
creative emerging solutions in order to modulate and 
complete the urban planning approach.    
2.2 (re)starting from people and usages
The second characteristic of both schools approaches 
is to focus on people as a starting point for the 
investigation of the place and of the projection of 
the future vision. Focusing on people is not primarily 
meant as an ethical issue (taking in consideration 
“The second characteristic of 
both schools approaches is

investigation of the  
place and of the projection 
of the future vision.” 
human values…) or as a marketing issue (tracking 
desires and expectations…) but as a more basic 
approach in term of usages of spaces and services. 
When first visiting the Paris-Saclay area, one of the 
urban planner from EPPS guiding the students said 
pointing at a fringe between Politechnique High 
school campus and agriculture area: “in 2018 a metro 
station will be built here and a new city centre will pop-
up…”?  The last decade of forced urban development 
in the outskirts of Paris demonstrated – if it still was 
necessary – that a top-down decision is not sufficient 
to fabricate urbanity and that a metro station plus 
shops and loggings do not necessarily makes a city 
centre but more likely a form of suburb that Marc Augé 
would certainly qualify as a ‘non-place’ (Augé, 1992). 
Paris-Saclay campus and Saint-Gilles neighbourhood 
are both ambivalent territories for their recent or 
current intense transformation process: they may 
become ‘non-place’ but have also the potential to be 
become very interesting hybrid spaces. 
The overall concept developed by the La Cambre team 
for the Saint-Gilles area build on the assets of this 
neighbourhood rather than on its problems: more 
than the provincial neighbourhood it used to be, it 
may be regarded as an outstanding campus, a diffused 
campus based on social inclusion between students 
and inhabitants. 
The Paris-Saclay Campus completely different in 
terms of size, situation and perspectives is also an 
ambivalent place: on the one hand, this huge and 
accelerated transformation of urban area into a 
patchwork of universities, labs, high-tech companies 
and former villages is likely to conduct to another type 
on ‘non-place’. On the other hand, Paris-Saclay Campus 
has to potential to be a living lab of a sustainable 
society building on the strong sensitivity on ecology 
and quality of life introduced by the first waves of 
scientists settling there since the early 60’s and 
combining this assets with the high tech companies 
and labs under greening pressure to find a close 
sustainability-oriented environment and population to 
beta-test their scenarios.
These two visions of a ‘campus-neighbourhood’ and 
an ‘advanced green city’ have clearly emerged from 
the exchanges between the design students and the 
populations they interact with. Promising practices and 
emerging initiatives clearly exists in the social fabric 
of the two territories. They are generally neither very 
visible nor the mainstream and they require a careful 
observation at people scale to detect these positive
