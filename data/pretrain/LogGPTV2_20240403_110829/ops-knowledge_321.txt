User: Please briefly introduce common authentication protocols (such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, etc.) and their principles
Assistant: 1. OAuth OAuth is an open authorization protocol used to authorize third-party applications to access user resources. It has the advantage of "OAuth enables users to access their protected resources stored on different service providers without sharing access credentials." It can confidently authorize third parties, avoiding the dangerous mistake of providing usernames and passwords . It utilizes the concept of delegation and divides the authorization process into four steps: (1) The third-party application requests authorization from the resource owner. (2) After receiving the request, the resource owner authorizes and issues authorization to the third party. (3) The third-party application uses the obtained authorization to access the resource server. (4) The resource server verifies and returns the resources requested by the third-party application. 2. OpenID Connect OpenID Connect is an open standard based on OAuth 2.0 that adds identity authentication. It uses JSON Web Token (JWT) as authentication token. OpenID Connect implements authentication through the following steps: (1) The user requests access to the application. (2) The application sends an authentication request on behalf of the user to the authorization server. (3) The authorization server guides the user to authenticate and authorize. (4) The authorization server issues an authentication token. (5) When a user accesses a protected resource in the application, the application sends the authentication token to the identity provider. (6) The identity provider verifies and returns a token. 3. SAML SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a standard that uses XML to describe authentication and authorization information, and supports the construction of Web-based secure single sign-on and identity management units (SMUs). SAML implements authentication through the following steps: (1) The user requests access to the application. (2) The application redirects the user to the Identity Provider (IdP). (3) The user authenticates on the identity provider. (4) The identity provider issues a SAML assertion (an XML document with authentication information). (5) The user provides the SAML assertion to the application. (6) The application sends a SAML assertion to the identity provider to authenticate the user. Summary The above three protocols are common authentication protocols that allow users to authenticate without revealing their passwords to third-party applications. OAuth utilizes the concept of a proxy, OpenID Connect utilizes JSON Web Tokens, and SAML uses XML assertions, each for authentication and authorization purposes.
