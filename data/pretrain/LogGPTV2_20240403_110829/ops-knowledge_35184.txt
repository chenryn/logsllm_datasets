User: There is a default python version, namely python 2.6, on the GPU server with Linux OS. Now I want to install a new python version on the server from its source, namely python 2.7. I should not change the default python version since I am not the administrator and some reason. So what should I do?
Assistant: You can install your new version of Python. It should be accessible with the python27 command (which may be a symbolic link).
Then you will just have to check that the python symbolic link still points to python26.
Doing this, python will keep on execute Python 2.6 while python27 will execute Python 2.7
