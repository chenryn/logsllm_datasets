User: When I try to run any of my app engine projects by python GoogleAppEngineLauncher
I got the error log as follows:
Does anyone have any ideas of what's going on?
I tried remove the SDK and reinstall it. Nothing happens. Still got the same error.
Everything is working fine and I don't think I made any changes before this happens.
The only thing that I can think of is that I install bigquery command line tool before this happens. But I don't think this should be the reason of this.
bad runtime process port ['']

Assistant: A recent upgrade of the development SDK started causing this problem for me. After much turmoil, I found that the problem was that the SDK was in a sub-directory of my project code. When I ran the SDK from a different (parent) directory the error went away.
