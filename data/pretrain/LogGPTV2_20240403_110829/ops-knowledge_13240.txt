When I attempt to run any of my App Engine projects using the GoogleAppEngineLauncher with Python, I encounter the following error:

```
bad runtime process port ['']
Traceback (most recent call last):

    raise ImportError('No module named %s' % fullname)
ImportError: No module named google.appengine.dist27.threading
```

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the SDK, but the issue persists. Everything was working fine before this, and I don't recall making any changes that could have caused this problem. The only thing I can think of is that I installed the BigQuery command-line tool, but I doubt this should be the cause.

Does anyone have any ideas about what might be going on?

**Solution:**

A recent update to the development SDK seems to have introduced this issue. After some investigation, I discovered that the problem occurs when the SDK is located in a sub-directory of the project code. Moving the SDK to a different (parent) directory and running it from there resolved the error.
