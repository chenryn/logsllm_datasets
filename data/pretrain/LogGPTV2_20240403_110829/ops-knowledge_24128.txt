User: I have a problem with Skype4Py lib in Mac OS. As I know from documentation in github, in macos skype4py must install with specific arch. But when I try to use arch -i386 pip2 install skype4py I get error message Bad CPU type in executable. I am not experienced user in macos (this is been a remote control in team viewer) but what I doing wrong? Also I tried use virtualenv and at the start all be ok, but when in shell I make client.Attach() I have a segfault. Please help. Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Ok, I was not able to solve the problem with Skype4Py on Mac OS. But perhaps someone will be useful to know that I have found a replacement. I used Ruby gem called skype. It works well on Mac OS. So, if you want to send message from script or anything else, just make gem install skype and start to write some ruby code :)
