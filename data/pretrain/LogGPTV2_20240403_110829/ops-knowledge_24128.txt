I understand you're experiencing difficulties with the Skype4Py library on macOS. Based on the GitHub documentation, it seems that a specific architecture is required for installation on macOS. However, when you attempt to install using `arch -i386 pip2 install skype4py`, you receive an error message stating "Bad CPU type in executable." Additionally, even after setting up a virtual environment, you encountered a segmentation fault (segfault) when executing `client.Attach()`.

Given your limited experience with macOS and remote access via TeamViewer, I can appreciate the frustration this situation may be causing. Although I couldn't resolve the issue with Skype4Py, I did find an alternative solution. A Ruby gem named 'skype' functions well on macOS and could serve as a replacement. To utilize this, simply run `gem install skype` and begin writing your Ruby scripts. This should allow you to send messages or perform other actions as needed. 

I hope this information proves helpful, and if you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
