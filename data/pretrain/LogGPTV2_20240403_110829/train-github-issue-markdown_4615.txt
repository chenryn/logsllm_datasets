## Expected Behavior
       None
       Short
       A bit longer
       Very, very, very long
Should display a long textField, as long as the "Very, very, very long"
option.
## Current Behavior

The TextField is very short, it uses the width of the selected option. When
nothing is selected, it is just not usable.
Besides, having the width of the field change according to the selected
element is disturbing.
