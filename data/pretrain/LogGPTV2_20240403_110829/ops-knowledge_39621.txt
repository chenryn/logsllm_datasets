User: According to the following arrangement, you need to design a high availability and load balancing solution for this network topology. Please provide a scenario and explain how to put it into action. The network topology consists of a main server responsible for routing and firewalling, two application servers for handling user requests, and a database server. Both the main server and the application server are connected to switch 1, and the database server is connected to switch 2.
Assistant: Solution: 1. Use the main server and firewall to achieve the first layer of load balancing, and distribute the requests from the Internet to the two application servers; 2. Use the load balancing software on the application servers to achieve the second layer of load balancing, and distribute the requests 3. Implement database master-slave replication on the database server, and distribute modification requests to all database instances; 4. Configure two-way link aggregation (LACP) to achieve network redundancy and high availability ; 5. Regularly back up data to back up the database loss situation. Actions: 1. Configure the firewall on the master server and install appropriate load balancing software; 2. Install the load balancing software on the application server, configure the application server as a member, and connect it to switch 1; 3. In the database Implement master-slave replication on the server and connect it to switch 2; 4. Configure two-way link aggregation (LACP) on all devices to achieve network redundancy and high availability; 5. Regularly back up data and review backup files to ensure backup success.
