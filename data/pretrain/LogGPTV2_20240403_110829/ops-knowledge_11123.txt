Assistant: First of all, for the parameter worker_processes, the number of CPU cores of the server needs to be considered, and it is best to set it according to the number of CPU cores. But also be careful not to set it too high, otherwise it will cause waste of resources. In this scenario, 4 worker_processes should be suitable. worker_connections is also a parameter that can be optimized. This parameter needs to be adjusted according to hardware performance and application load. You can perform a pressure test to see how many connections each worker_processes can carry at most, and then set it according to the test results. gzip is an optimization method that can significantly improve server performance and responsiveness. But you need to make sure that the server's CPU can take on this compression/decompression work. TCP parameters such as sendfile, tcp_nopush, and tcp_nodelay can be adjusted according to the network conditions of the server to optimize data transmission performance. In addition, the cache of the Nginx server can be optimized to reduce I/O operations and improve response speed. Also regularly clean logs and caches to prevent them from taking up too much disk space.
