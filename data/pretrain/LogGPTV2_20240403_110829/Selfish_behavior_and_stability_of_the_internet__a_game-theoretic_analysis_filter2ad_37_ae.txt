Since our aim is only to model the drop policy of AQM schemes
at a very high level, we do not delve into analytically deriving
the above functions. Rather, we employ simulations to obtain
measurements that help us estimate the above functions for RED
gateways.
In addition, it is important to note that the above
functions may be diﬀerent for TCP-Tahoe, Reno and SACK.
In Figures 5(a) and (b), we show how pa and dp
as functions of α for the three TCP variants. Figures 5(c) and
(d) show the corresponding results for β. We will use these esti-
mates in the analyses presented in the following sections to obtain
the congestion control parameters at Nash equilibrium. We now
deal with each of Tahoe/Severe, SACK/Gentle and Reno/Hybrid
cases in turn. We summarize our observations for RED gateways
towards the end of this section.
4.3.1 TCP-Tahoe/Severe Penalty
Analysis of Severe Penalty We ﬁrst derive an expression for
the goodput of a Severe ﬂow with congestion control parameters
(α, β) experiencing a steady state packet loss rate p. We assume
that the packet losses are distributed uniformly over the entire
(cid:1)
a
dα(cid:1) |α(cid:1)=α vary
transmission interval of the ﬂow and that the ﬂow never experi-
ences more than one loss, on an average, in a single round (that
is, losses do not occur in bursts).
Let τO be the expected number of rounds between successive
multiplicative decreases in the congestion window of this ﬂow. Let
τ = τO − τS . In expectation, we can write, N = (τ − τS )α β
β−1
(using Equation 14). Then, from Equation 16, the expected to-
tal number of packets transmitted by the ﬂow in these rounds
between consecutive window decreases is given by
S =
N + tα

never occur in bursts, we can write p = 1
these previous two equations we obtain, τ ≈  2(1−β)
Since we assume that the losses are uniformly distributed and
S . Eliminating S from
pα(1+β) . The
expected length (in seconds) of the τO rounds taken to transmit
the S packets is T = RτS +R(τ +1), where R is the average round
trip delay (including the queueing delay). Hence, the expected
goodput of the ﬂow is, approximately, G = S
RτS +R(τ +1) .
Now, from the fact p = 1
T =

Simulation of Tahoe The results for the Nash equilibria from
the simulation of the TCP Game for TCP Tahoe ﬂows with RED
gateways are shown in Figure 7. From Figure 7(a), when Tahoe
ﬂows are allowed to vary their increase parameters, αE = 34,
closely matching the analytical results. The Nash equilibrium
is undesirable since the per-ﬂow goodput at Nash equilibrium is
rather low. When ﬂows are allowed to vary their decrease param-
eters, βE = 0.98 at Nash equilibrium, as predicted by analysis.
Again, this Nash equilibrium is undesirable too due to the low
per-ﬂow goodput.
When α and β are varied simultaneously, (αE , βE) = (27, 0.98)
at Nash equilibrium. The average goodput at this Nash equil-
brium is 0.73Mbps and the per-ﬂow loss rate is 2.5% making this
an undesirable Nash equilibrium.
