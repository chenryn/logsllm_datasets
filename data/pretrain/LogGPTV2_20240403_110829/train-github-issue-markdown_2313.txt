  1. Create a new JS file in a project set to ES6
  2. Add the following code  
var mytext = `some ES6 \'text\'`;  
// this comment is brown  
console.log('the console log is brown but this string inside it is
coloured!');
You will see that everything after the first ' is brown. I am aware that there
is no need to use the backslash to escape the ' character, but as far as I am
aware it is also not invalid javascript. And if it is invalid, I would expect
some other kind of error to indicate that it is invalid.
