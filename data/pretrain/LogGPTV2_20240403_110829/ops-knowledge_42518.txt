User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题E-Mail notification when hard disk full? Is there an easy way to set up E-Mail notification when a Windows 2008 server's hard disk is getting full?

Assistant: From Vista/2008 onwards Microsoft added the ability to attach actions to events, You can setup a e-mail alert to be sent whenever the event id 2013 (disk drive near capacity) is triggered.

Open the Task Scheduler MMC, start the Create a Basic Task Wizard, give it a name and select on the event trigger. Set the Log to "System" Source to "Srv" and Event ID to "2013".

Then assuming you have a usable SMTP server just set the action to send you an e-mail.

The information you get is pretty basic, there are a lot of good monitoring tools freely available that handle this as well (SpiceWorks is one I recall).
