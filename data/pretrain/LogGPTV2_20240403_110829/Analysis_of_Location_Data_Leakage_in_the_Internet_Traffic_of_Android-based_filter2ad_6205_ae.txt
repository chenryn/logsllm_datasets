visibility to all running applications and can apply access
control policies as well as obfuscation techniques; (2) auto-
mated with minimal user involvement and decision making;
(3) as proposed in our study, it should analyze the privacy
exposure level not only by a single application but also by
looking at the network trafﬁc as a whole in order to miti-
gate the risk of a network eavesdropper adversary; and (4) it
should apply intelligent machine learning techniques to auto-
matically identify location data (and other PII) leaks, thereby
proﬁling applications in order to understand the level of gran-
ularity of location data required by each application, and to
intelligently obfuscate the POIs that can be inferred from the
transmitted data. Since the experimental setup of this research
was complex and resource and time consuming, we opted to
leave the design, development and evaluation of the defense
approaches, especially applying PII obfuscation as an adver-
sarial learning approach on the clustering algorithms [55], for
future research.

OS policy and tools. The Android OS provides built-in
standard security solutions features such as isolation, en-
cryption, memory management, and user-granted permissions
for phone resources and sensors. Once permission has been
granted by the user, PII handling is done solely by best prac-
tice recommendations [44]. This may include enforcing en-
cryption on applications that send sensitive information such
as location over the Internet or applying a tool such as Priva-
cyGuard [19] which is a VPN-based solution that can detect
data leakage over the network trafﬁc, modify the leaked infor-
mation, and replace it with data crafted for privacy protection.
Other tools such as MockDroid [45] and LP-Guardian [46]
can be used to block an application from accessing the lo-
cation sensor at runtime. In addition, future versions of the
Android OS could consider improving privacy by enabling
user decisions regarding background operation involving sen-
sitive data.

In this paper, we showed the extent of location leakage from
mobile devices and presented a systematic process of extract-
ing location traces from raw network trafﬁc. We analyzed the
results of three geo-clustering methods applied over inconsis-
tent network trafﬁc data and showed that existing algorithms
yield good results, even with inconsistent location data; this
makes any user location privacy vulnerable, even with a low
rate of location leakage. Our work enables location exposure
assessment by monitoring network trafﬁc and reveals that
even relatively low location leakage rates (once in six hours)
and coverage of only 20% can expose approximately 70% of
the weighted POIs. In future work we plan to further auto-
mate the POI identiﬁcation process by automatically setting
up the clustering algorithm parameters, evaluate the extent to
which the leaked data can be used to predict the users future
location, and develop a mitigation approach based on adver-
sarial learning techniques, which will be based on injecting a
minimal number of false locations in clear text to the network
trafﬁc, in order to deceive the clustering algorithms (i.e., PII
obfuscation).
