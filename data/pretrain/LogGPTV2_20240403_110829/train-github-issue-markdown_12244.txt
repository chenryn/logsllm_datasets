## Expected Behavior
FontIcon's onClick method's action should be able to override the hoverColor's
reset callback after the click.
## Current Behavior
When a hoverColor is specified for the fonticon, the method called by it's
onClick function, which sets it's color, gets overriden by the old color due
to hoverColor's callback.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
https://codesandbox.io/s/r5825125jo
  1. Create a fonticon component within an iconbutton. Don't set a hoverColor.
  2. Define it's onClick function to modify it's color as: `onClick={(e)=>{e.target.style = "color:#33FF33 !important";console.log(e.target.style.color)}}`
  3. Check the console output which will show that the color changed successfully and it is retained.
  4. Repeat 1 and 2 but this time with a hoverColor mentioned.
  5. Even after the click, when there is no hover, the color goes back to the predefined color. Same can be seen in the console with `console.log(document.getElementByID('icon_id').style.color);`
  6. Tried it with `e.target.style.color='#33FF33'` earlier which too didn't work.
## Context
I am trying to implement the Favorite/Like button which should turn red on
hover and should stay red after being clicked. However it goes back to being
black if there is no hover, even after being clicked.
