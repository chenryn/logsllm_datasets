- **I am not a lawyer.**
- **My presentation is both unintentionally and intentionally biased by my own beliefs.**

- **Bottom line: Don't take my word for it; read the source material and form your own opinion!**

## Part II: The Fourth Amendment
### The Fourth Amendment
- **"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."**

#### Key Questions
- **Was the action performed by the government?**
  - **Someone acting in an official capacity on behalf of the federal or state government**
  - **Can be a federal or state official, or a private individual acting on behalf of the government**
- **Was there a reasonable expectation of privacy?**
  - **A government intrusion only constitutes a "search" when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy**
  - **Otherwise, it is not a search and the Fourth Amendment does not apply**
  - **Reasonable expectation of privacy:**
    - **Actual expectation of privacy**
    - **Your expectation is reasonable to society as a whole**
    - **Inside/outside (home, container, body)**
    - **Content/non-content (digital)**
    - **Private/shared (social network)**
- **Was there a warrant?**
  - **Consent**
  - **Plain view**
  - **Open fields**
  - **Curtilage**
  - **Exigent circumstances**
  - **Motor vehicle**
- **Was the warrant proper and executed correctly?**
  - **Proper:**
    - **Probable cause**
    - **Particularity**
    - **Neutral magistrate**
    - **Signed under oath**
    - **PC not stale/out of date**
  - **Execution:**
    - **Timely/Time of day**
    - **Knock and announce**
    - **Search only areas listed in warrant**
    - **Seize only items listed in warrant & plain view**

#### Exceptions to the Exclusionary Rule
- **Good faith**
- **Inevitable discovery**
- **Independent source**
- **Intervening acts**

#### Burden of Proof
- **Reasonable suspicion**
- **Probable cause**
- **Preponderance of the evidence**
- **Beyond reasonable doubt**

## Part III: Things That Should Concern You
### 1. Administrative Searches
- **Definition: A search conducted as part of a general regulatory scheme**
- **Problem: Generally, administrative searches are considered reasonable if they are no more intrusive or intensive than necessary and thus not subject to further Fourth Amendment scrutiny; pre-textual for criminality**
- **Solution: Demonstrate that searches are increasingly intrusive in light of current technology**
- **Verdict: Tough row to hoe**

### 2. Administrative Warrants and Subpoenas
- **Definition: Authorizes searches for regulatory schemes, or to obtain "non-content" information**
- **Problem: Some forms of administrative warrants or subpoenas, such as National Security Letters, have very little judicial oversight; PC not required?**
- **Solution: Continue to support efforts to publicize abuse**
- **Verdict: Doe v. Ashcroft began to roll back NSLs; but more work must continue**

### 3. Public Surveillance
- **Definition: Surveillance cameras, GPS tracking, marking our every move**
- **Problem: Long-term surveillance, technology increases the intrusion even in public spaces; amassing of data without suspicion**
- **Solution: Use privacy-enhancing technologies to our advantage; publicize known and obvious abuses**
- **Verdict: Are we too far down the slippery slope?**

### 4. Schools and Students’ Rights
- **Definition: Students are often denied the same basic rights as other citizens**
- **Problem: While there are legitimate concerns about disrupting an educational environment, this reason is often used as a pretext to invade students' civil rights**
- **Solution: Parents must continue to stay informed about their children and stand up for their rights**
- **Verdict: Students' rights have eroded since Tinker**

### 5. Legislators, Judges, and Technology
- **Definition: Many legislators and judges show little aptitude for understanding technology**
- **Problem: Technologically incompetent legislators write poor laws, judges make poor decisions; ultimately, the justice system becomes undermined**
- **Solution: Technology education, technology courts, run for office yourself?**
- **Verdict: An uphill battle, but one worth fighting**

### 6. It’s Your Fault, Too
- **Definition: We share a lot of information voluntarily**
- **Problem: By openly sharing so much information, we lower the overall societal expectation of privacy and thus subject ourselves to more governmental intrusion**
- **Solution: Just because we can share, doesn’t mean we have to**
- **Verdict: Another case where we might be too far down the slope to reverse course**

## Some Final Observations
### Unresolved Questions
- **Is email privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment? [Warshak v. United States]**
- **Is warrantless GPS tracking constitutional? [United States v. Jones]**
- **Can your cell phone be searched during a traffic stop? Is a warrant required to search it after an arrest? [People v. Diaz, CA and State v. Smith, OH]**
- **Can the government force you to reveal a password for an encrypted device? [United States v. Fricosu]**

### Is Privacy Dead?
- **Perhaps not yet, but it’s dying fast**
- **We can reclaim privacy by protecting our information and refusing to share so much voluntarily, and in turn increasing society’s expectation of privacy**
- **Increase awareness by shining the light on governmental intrusions into privacy rights**
- **Shift our focus**

### A New Focus
- **Do you have the right to wear red hats on Wednesdays? Why or why not? Or should we ask the question another way?**
- **Enumerated powers, Ninth Amendment, Tenth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment**
- **Islands of liberty in a sea of power, or islands of power in a sea of liberty?**
- **Only you can make a difference for you**
