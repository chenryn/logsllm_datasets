Why you should be skeptical
• I am not a lawyer
• My presentation is (both) unintentionally 
and intentionally biased by my own beliefs
• This isn’t a political presentation, but it is 
inevitably influenced by political issues
• Bottom line: Don’t take my word for it; read 
the source material and make up your own 
mind!

not particularly described 
and supported by evidence, 
are grievous and oppressive 
and ought not to be granted.
State Constitutions

between the Declaration of Independence

(Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina)

eventual language of the Fourth Amendment

include any provisions resembling the eventual 
Fourth Amendment, but all three states did 
explicitly include provisions that incorporated 
English common law

persons, houses, papers, and effects, against 
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not 
be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but 
upon probable cause, supported by Oath or 
affirmation, and particularly describing the 
place to be searched, and the persons or 
things to be seized.

Key questions
• Was the action performed by the 
government?
• Was there a reasonable expectation of 
privacy?
• Was there a warrant?
• Was the warrant proper and executed 
correctly?
Was the action performed 
by the government?
• Someone acting in an official capacity on 
behalf of the federal or state government
• Can be a federal or state official, or a 
private individual acting on behalf of the 
federal or state government
Was there a reasonable 
expectation of privacy?
• A government intrusion only constitutes a 
“search” when there is a reasonable 
expectation of privacy
• Otherwise, it is not a search and the Fourth 
Amendment does not apply
Reasonable expectation of privacy
1. Actual expectation of privacy
2. Your expectation is reasonable to society 
as a whole

WTF HAPPENED TO THE 
CONSTITUTION?
Part III: Things That 
Should Piss You Off
Things that should piss you off
1. Administrative searches
2. Administrative warrants and subpoenas
3. Public surveillance
4. Schools and students’ rights
5. Legislators, judges and technology
6. It’s your fault, too
Administrative searches
• What is it? A search conducted as part of a 
general regulatory scheme
• Why is it problematic? Generally, 
administrative searches are considered 
reasonable if they are no more intrusive or 
intensive than necessary and thus not 
subject to further Fourth Amendment 
scrutiny; pre-textual for criminality
• What can we do about it? Demonstrate 
that searches are increasingly intrusive in 
light of current technology
• Verdict: tough row to hoe
Administrative warrants and subpoenas
• What is it? Authorizes searches for 
regulatory schemes, or to obtain “non-
content” information
• Why is it problematic? Some forms of 
administrative warrants or subpoenas, such 
as National Security Letters, have very little 
judicial oversight; PC not required?
• What can we do about it? Continue to 
support efforts to publicize abuse
• Verdict: Doe v. Ashcroft began to rollback 
NSLs; but more work must continue
Public surveillance
• What is it? Surveillance cameras, GPS 
tracking, marking our every move
• Why is it problematic? Long term 
surveillance, technology increases the 
intrusion even in public spaces; amassing of 
data without suspicion
• What can we do about it? Use privacy-
enhancing technologies to our advantage; 
publicize known and obvious abuses
• Verdict: Are we too far down the slippery 
slope?
Schools and students’ rights
• What is it? Students are often denied the 
same basic rights as other citizens
• Why is it problematic? While there are 
legitimate concerns about disrupting an 
educational environment, this reason is 
often used as a pretext to invade students’ 
civil rights 
• What can we do about it? Parents must 
continue to stay informed about their 
children and stand up for their rights
• Verdict: Students rights have eroded since 
Tinker
Legislators, judges and technology
• What is it? Many legislators and judges 
show little aptitude for understanding 
technology that
• Why is it problematic? Technologically 
incompetent legislators write poor laws, 
judges make poor decisions; ultimately, the 
justice system becomes undermined
• What can we do about it? Technology 
education, technology courts, run for office 
yourself?
• Verdict: an uphill battle, but one worth 
fighting
Specialty courts
• Bankruptcy Courts
• U.S. Court of International Trade
• U.S. Court of Federal Claims
• Court of Appeals for Veterans’ Claims
• U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces
• Technology Courts?
It’s your fault, too
• What is it? We share a lot of information 
voluntarily
• Why is it problematic? By openly sharing 
so much information, we lower the overall 
societal expectation of privacy and thus 
subject ourselves to more governmental 
intrusion
• What can we do about it? Just because we 
can share, doesn’t mean we have to
• Verdict: Another case where we might be 
too far down the slope to reverse course
Voluntary disclosure of privacy
WTF HAPPENED TO THE 
CONSTITUTION?
Some Final Observations
Unresolved questions
• Is email privacy protected by the Fourth 
Amendment? [Warshak v. United States]
• Is warrantless GPS tracking constitutional? 
[United States v. Jones]
• Can your cell phone be searched during a 
traffic stop? Is a warrant required to search 
it after an arrest? [People v. Diaz, CA and 
State v. Smith, OH]
• Can the government force you to reveal a 
password for an encrypted device? [United 
States v. Fricosu]
Is privacy dead?
• Perhaps not yet, but it’s dying fast
• We can reclaim privacy by protecting our 
information and refusing to share so much 
voluntarily, and in turn increasing society’s 
expectation of privacy
• Increase awareness by shining the light on 
governmental intrusions into privacy rights
• Shift our focus
A new focus
• Do you have the right to wear red hats on 
Wednesdays? Why or why not? Or should 
we ask the question another way?
• Enumerated powers, Ninth Amendment, 
Tenth Amendment, Fourteenth 
Amendment
• Islands of liberty in a sea of power, or 
islands of power in a sea of liberty?
• Only you can make a difference for you
