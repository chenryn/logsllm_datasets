User: When there are a large number of users accessing the application, what measures can be taken to optimize the number of concurrent connections and request processing efficiency?
Assistant: 1. Use a load balancer: The load balancer can distribute requests to multiple servers for processing, avoiding single point of failure and busy servers that cannot respond to requests in a timely manner. 2. Use cache: cache can reduce the number of database and file system reads and improve data read efficiency. 3. Use asynchronous programming: Using asynchronous programming can process other requests while the request is waiting, improving the efficiency of request processing. 4. Vertical splitting: assign different functional modules to different servers for processing to avoid bottlenecks in the entire application. 5. Horizontal splitting: assign the same data to different servers for storage to avoid overloading of a single server. 6. Using CDN: Using CDN can distribute static resources to different nodes around the world, speed up resource transmission, and reduce the burden on servers. 7. Optimize the database: optimize the database through indexing, sharding, etc., to improve read and write efficiency.
