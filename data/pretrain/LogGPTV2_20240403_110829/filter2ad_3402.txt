1. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Providing anonymity to network communication refers to
the prevention of “networking information” retrieval, not
only using the content of transmitted data packets but also
from their timing information. Access to such timing in-
formation can reveal the source-destination pairs or path of
data ﬂow which is a violation of user privacy, and can fur-
ther be used to jam a particular ﬂow or create black holes.
Chaum Mixes [1] are often used to obfuscate this timing in-
formation from malicious eavesdroppers. A Chaum Mix is a
relay node or a proxy server that collects packets from diﬀer-
ent users, then uses layered encryption and packet padding
to make outgoing packets appear indistinguishable to eaves-
droppers. Furthermore, it also alters the timing information
by reordering and batching together packets from diﬀerent
users, so that the probability of any outgoing packet be-
longing to a particular user is identical for all users, thus
achieving perfect anonymity.
A drawback of the ideal Chaum Mix is that if long data
streams (eg. media streaming) are transmitted, then it may
require a very large buﬀer capacity to work well. In fact, it
has been proven that any batching strategy, under the con-
straint of a limited buﬀer size, would eventually reveal the
source identities [2]. It is, however, possible to mask the ac-
tual pattern of traﬃc ﬂow through the insertion of dummy
traﬃc. For example, consider a network where all nodes
transmit packets according to scheduled departure times. If
an actual packet is unavailable for transmission at its time of
departure, a dummy packet can be transmitted in its place
and perfect anonymity is still maintained. But the exten-
sive use of dummy packets can reduce network throughput,
which leads to some interesting questions:

1. For a ﬁxed buﬀer size, what is the optimal mixing
strategy to achieve perfect anonymity with minimum
possible dummy rate (number of dummy packets per
second)?
2. For a ﬁxed buﬀer size, what is the minimum dummy
rate required for a mix to achieve perfect anonymity?
Further, how does this minimum dummy rate scale
with buﬀer size?
In this work, the above questions are addressed using an
analytical approach.
2. APPROACH AND CONTRIBUTION
Optimal mixing strategy Ψ: For a ﬁxed buﬀer size B,
the mix waits until at least one packet from each user ar-
rives or until the buﬀer is full. If packets from all users arrive
before the buﬀer is full, then one packet of each user is se-
lected and they are randomly ordered and sent in succession.
Otherwise, the mix generates one additional dummy packet
for each user missing in the buﬀer, and performs the above
operation treating the dummy packets as actual packets of
missing users.
Theorem 1. The strategy Ψ is optimal for achieving min-
imum dummy rate.
Due to the constraint of page limit, we omit the proof here.
Using strategy Ψ, we can compute the exact rate of dummy
transmission for a two source mix.
Theorem 2. The minimum dummy rate required by a
mix serving two sources of rates λ1, λ2 respectively is given
by
λ1ρ2B+1 − λ1ρ2B + λ2ρ − λ2
μ =
ρ2B+1 − 1
and hence when λ1 = λ2 = λ,
where ρ =
λ1
λ2
.
μ =
2λ
2B + 1
.
The proof is omitted for brevity. The same proof technique
can also be applied when more than two users are present,
but it involves the analysis of multidimensional Markov chains
which are analytically intractable. We can, however, provide
lower and upper bounds on the minimum achievable dummy
rate for the general k user case.

Theorem 3. For a k−source mix with buﬀer size B, there
exists constants K1, K2 independent of B such that the min-
imum required dummy rate D(B, k) satisﬁes:
K1
B
≤ D(B, k) ≤ K2

.
The lower bound on the dummy rate holds true regardless
of the mixing strategy employed, thus providing a useful
performance benchmark.
To get the upper-bound, we consider a sub-optimal strat-
egy Ψ, under which the mix ﬁrst divides the buﬀer into two
equal halves, each of size B/2. The mix stores all incoming
packets in the ﬁrst half of the buﬀer until it is full. Amongst
the B/2 packets now present in the buﬀer, the mix transmits
the maximum number of packets in a batch, such that the
number of packets from each source is equal. The remaining
packets are shifted to the second half of the buﬀer. This
process is repeated until the second half of the buﬀer is full.
At this point, all the packets in the second half of the buﬀer
are transmitted in a single batch with enough dummy trans-
missions such that the number of packets from each source is
equal. Thus, by calculating the upper limit on the required
dummy rate for strategy Ψ, we obtain an upper bound on
D(B, k) . The detailed proof is omitted due to paucity of
space.
In Fig. 1, we plot the numerically computed dummy rate
using the multidimensional Markov chain (optimal strat-
egy), and compare it with the bounds. As is evident from the
plots, the convergence rate of the optimal strategy matches
that of the lower bound. This fact, in conjunction with the
result on the convergence rate for the two-source system in-
dicates that the optimal convergence rate is O

3. ANONYMITY IN A NETWORK
Thus far, we studied the dummy transmission rate re-
quired at a single mix to achieve perfect anonymity. The
anonymity, as quantiﬁed using the Shannon entropy of packet
sources would amount to log k, if there are k sources trans-
mitting to the mix.
In a general multihop network, as
the packet streams traverse through multiple mixes, the
anonymity of packet sources at any given link would be the
result of cumulative mixing at previous nodes in the path of
the streams. This cumulative anonymity can be computed
using the chain rule of entropy [3].
Theorem 4. If A1, A2,··· , Ak denote the entropy of packet
sources of k streams that are mixed at a given intermediate
node, then the entropy of sources on the outgoing stream of
packets is given by:
(cid:4)
Ai
k + 1.
A =
Using the fact that mixes that received packets directly from
sources achieve anonymity of log k, we can recursively com-
pute the anonymity of packets on any link.
It is important to note that to achieve this anonymity,
it is critical that the generated dummy packets are relayed
by subsequent nodes as though they were data packets, and
consequently, while anonymity builds up at successive mixes,
the true rate of data packets drops, thus resulting in a trade-
oﬀ between anonymity and throughput.
