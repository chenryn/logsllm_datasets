### Interests and Background

By building upon the newly acquired knowledge, readers can leverage their interests and background to explore and apply what they have learned in various ways.

### Book Features

The book employs a variety of tools to provide a comprehensive examination of Mac OS X, including:
- Detailed illustrations
- Function call graphs
- Annotated code excerpts
- Programming examples

To maintain engagement and accessibility, the book also includes:
- Relevant trivia
- Digressions
- Tidbits
- A generous use of footnotes

### Target Audience

This book is designed to be useful for anyone interested in the composition and functionality of Mac OS X. Specifically, it caters to:
- **Application Programmers**: Gain a deeper understanding of how applications interact with the system.
- **System Programmers**: Use the book as a reference to better understand the core system architecture.
- **General Programmers**: A solid grasp of system internals is invaluable for design, development, and debugging. It helps in understanding system capabilities, feasibility, optimal solutions, and the reasons behind specific program behaviors.
- **Mac OS X Users**: Learn about the system's design and how its components work together.
- **System Administrators and Technical Support Staff**: Find valuable insights for managing and troubleshooting the system.
- **Technical Communities (e.g., BSD, Linux, Windows)**: Broaden their knowledge and compare/contrast Mac OS X with other operating systems.

The book is also suitable for advanced operating systems courses, particularly for case studies on Mac OS X. However, it is not an introductory text; while some background information is provided, the material is generally at an advanced level.

### Book Structure

Modern operating systems are complex, making it challenging to cover all aspects in a single book. This book aims to provide substantial breadth and depth, with carefully selected programming examples. It is organized into twelve chapters, each containing sections accessible to non-programmers.

#### Chapter Summaries

1. **Origins of Mac OS X**
   - Describes the technical history of Mac OS X and its predecessors.
   - An unabridged version covering all Apple operating systems is available on the book's website.

2. **An Overview of Mac OS X**
   - Provides a broad overview of Mac OS X and its key features.
   - Includes brief overviews of the system's layers.

3. **Inside an Apple**
   - Focuses on the PowerPC architecture, using the PowerPC 970 ("G5") processor as an example.
   - Discusses PowerPC assembly language and calling conventions.

4. **The Firmware and the Bootloader**
   - Covers Open Firmware and the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), along with their respective bootloaders.
   - Explains the roles of firmware and bootloaders in system operation and early bootstrapping.

5. **Kernel and User-Level Startup**
   - Details the sequence of events from kernel execution to the first user-space program (launchd).
   - Discusses launchd's function and implementation.

6. **The xnu Kernel**
   - Explores the core kernel architecture of Mac OS X.
   - Includes system call families, low-level tracing, debugging mechanisms, and special features like the virtual machine monitor.

7. **Processes**
   - Examines abstractions such as tasks, threads, and processes.
   - Discusses processor scheduling and interfaces for manipulating these abstractions.

8. **Memory**
   - Describes the Mac OS X memory subsystem, including Mach virtual memory, paging, buffer cache, working-set detection, and memory allocators.
   - Covers support for 64-bit addressing.

9. **Interprocess Communication**
   - Discusses IPC and synchronization mechanisms in Mac OS X.
   - Focuses on the implementation and usage of Mach IPC.

10. **Extending the Kernel**
    - Introduces the I/O Kit, the object-oriented driver subsystem in Mac OS X.

11. **File Systems**
    - Provides an overview of the file system layer in Mac OS X.
    - Discusses partitioning schemes, disk management, and Spotlight search technology.

12. **The HFS Plus File System**
    - Delves into the internals of the HFS Plus file system.
    - Uses a custom file system debugger to aid in the discussion.

### How to Read This Book

- **First Two Chapters**: Provide essential background and an overall picture of Mac OS X. Reading these first is recommended.
- **Subsequent Chapters**: Best read sequentially, but you can skip certain sections or chapters based on your interests and familiarity with the topics.
- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with operating system concepts and experience with Unix operating systems is helpful.
- **Programming Experience**: Knowledge of C programming is beneficial, as the book includes many C programs and code excerpts.

### Using the Examples

- **Self-Contained Examples**: The book includes numerous self-contained examples, many of which are both useful and interesting.
- **Compilation and Execution**: Most examples include command lines for compilation and execution.
- **Testing**: Examples were tested on both PowerPC-based and x86-based Macintosh computers where applicable.
- **Rosetta Compatibility**: Some PowerPC-only code can run on x86-based Macs using Rosetta, but a few examples require a PowerPC Mac.

### Preface

- **Background**: Mac OS X, despite being relatively new, has a rich lineage. The book aims to deconstruct and demystify Mac OS X from a system-design perspective.
- **Approach**: Takes an implementation-oriented approach, explaining the design and implementation of fundamental mechanisms and how other mechanisms are layered on top.
- **Goals**: Provide enough knowledge and examples for readers to build upon and apply their newly gained knowledge according to their interests and background.
