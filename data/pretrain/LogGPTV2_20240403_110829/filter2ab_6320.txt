**Title: Botconf 2014 - The Many Faces of Mevade**

**Abstract:**
Mevade, also known as Sefnit, is a botnet primarily involved in click-fraud and cryptocurrency mining. This botnet is notable for two significant reasons: its massive scale, with several million computers infected at its peak, and the disruption it caused to the Tor network when it hosted its Command and Control (C&C) servers on Tor hidden services. In this presentation, we will provide an in-depth overview of Mevade, including its evolution over time. A substantial portion of the presentation will focus on our research into the non-Tor C&C communication and the unusual domain names used for C&C. We will also explore the connections between Mevade and other forms of adware and malware. Our team continuously monitors this botnet and its developments, and we will present any new findings that emerge in the months leading up to the conference.
