title:botconf2014 The Many Faces of Mevade
Mevade (also known as Sefnit) is a botnet that engages in click-fraud and cryptocurrency mining. Mevade is noticeable for two reasons. Firstly, it is huge: at some point, several millions of computers had been infected. And secondly, when it hosted its C&C servers on Tor hidden services, it almost took down the Tor network. In this presentation we will give an overview of what is known about Mevade and how the botnet has evolved over time. A large part of the presentation will focus on the research performed on the non-Tor C&C communication and the somewhat unusual choice of domain names for C&C communication. We will also discuss about links between Mevade and other kinds of adware and malware. We are actively following this botnet and the developments around it and will of course present any developments taking place in the months prior to the conference.Outline of presentation:History of MevadeOverview of the malwareClick-fraudCryptocurrency mining and the Stratum mining protocol used by MevadeNetwork communication Using Tor for C&CLinks to other kinds of botnet and malwareNew developments
