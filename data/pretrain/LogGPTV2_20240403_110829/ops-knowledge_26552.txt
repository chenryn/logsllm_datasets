User: As a newbie to app engine and python I can follow the examples given by Google and have created a python application with a template HTML page where I can enter data, submit it to the datastore and by reading back the data, just sent, recreate the sending page so I can continue adding data and store again.  However what I would like to do is submit the data, have it stored in the datastore without the sending page being refreshed. It seems like a waste of traffic to have all the data sent back again.
Assistant: Sounds like you want to look into AJAX. The simplest way to do this is probably to use the ajax functions in one of the popular Javascript libraries, like jQuery.
