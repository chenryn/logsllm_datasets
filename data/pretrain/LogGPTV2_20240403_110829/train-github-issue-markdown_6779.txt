I see on my website and on your online docs this bug :  
When you click to "Launch demo modal", the modal appear. I click on "close",
the modal disappear. But when I click again on "Launch demo modal", the button
close doesn't work.  
You can see that on : http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals
In Bootstrap 2.3.2, it's correct :
http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals
Can you fixe that?
