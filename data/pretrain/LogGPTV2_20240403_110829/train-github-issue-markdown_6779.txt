Subject: Issue with "Close" Button on Demo Modal in Bootstrap Documentation

Dear Support Team,

I have encountered a bug on both my website and your online documentation regarding the demo modal functionality. The issue is as follows:

1. When I click on "Launch demo modal," the modal appears as expected.
2. Upon clicking the "Close" button, the modal disappears.
3. However, when I click on "Launch demo modal" again, the "Close" button no longer functions.

This problem can be observed at: [http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals)

For reference, the same functionality works correctly in Bootstrap 2.3.2, as demonstrated here: [http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals)

Could you please address this issue?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
