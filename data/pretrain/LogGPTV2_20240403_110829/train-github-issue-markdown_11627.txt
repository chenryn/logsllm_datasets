Recently, I've been developing fast permutation tests that can make use of
numpy/scipy matrix operations.
So far, I have developed 3 permutation tests: a mean test, a t-test and a
pearson correlation test.
To get an idea for the timings, I've benchmarked the mean test to a naive
implementation on a 60x60 table and with 1000 permutations. Below are the
timings
Naive time [s]: 1.91008838018  
Numpy time [s]: 0.0174480279287
If you guys are down, I can start committing these algorithms into scipy. In
the near future, I plan on implementing ANOVA tests such as an F-test and a
Krustal-Wallis test.
