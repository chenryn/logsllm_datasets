User: How would I download files (video) with Python using wget and save them locally? There will be a bunch of files, so how do I know that one file is downloaded so as to automatically start downloding another one?
Thanks.
Assistant: No reason to use python. Avoid writing a shell script in Python and go with something like bash or an equivalent.
