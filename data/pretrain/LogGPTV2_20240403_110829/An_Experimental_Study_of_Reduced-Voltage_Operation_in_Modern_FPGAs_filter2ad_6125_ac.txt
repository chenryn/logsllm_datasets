The PS part features a quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53
and is mainly used for the host communication in DNNDK.
The PL part has 32.1Mbit of BRAMs, 600K LUTs, and 2520
DSPs. For the CNN implementation, DPUs are mapped into
the PL side. As mentioned earlier, our baseline hardware con-
ﬁguration employs three B4096 DPUs, the maximum possible
number, leading to a maximum utilization fraction of more
than 75% for BRAMs and DSPs. ZCU102 is equipped with an
8GB 64-bit DDR-4 off-chip memory. In our implementation,
this memory contains input images and CNN parameters. It is
also used for interfacing purposes with the host.
3.3.2. Undervolting Methodology. Unfortunately, there is no
voltage scaling standard for FPGAs. Different vendors have
their unique voltage management methodologies. Moreover,
there are some platforms without voltage scaling capability,
such as the Xilinx Zedboard [7]. Even a single vendor’s differ-
ent devices do not necessarily have the same voltage distribu-
tion model. Although this non-standard approach of vendors
adds some constraints to experimental studies, such as the one
conducted in this paper, we believe that, with minor changes,
the methodology we explain below for ZCU102 can be ap-
plicable to other platforms, as, for instance, we previously
studied for on-chip memories of older FPGA generations [96].
Figure 2, adapted from [125], depicts the voltage distribu-
tion model of ZCU102. Here, the voltage scaling capabil-
ity is provided using an on-board voltage regulator that can
convert an input voltage level of 12V into different voltage
levels. The voltage level of the output lines, usually called volt-
age rails, is fully conﬁgurable and also addressable using the
Power Management Bus (PMBus) standard [83]. Each voltage
rail feeds one or more components of the FPGA platform.
ZCU102 is equipped with three voltage regulators, which in
total provide 26 voltage rails accessible through the PMBus.
In this paper, we focus on on-chip voltage rails: VCCINT and
VCCBRAM, as shown in Figure 2. VCCINT is accessible with
PMBus address 0x13 and Vnom = 850mV ; it supplies multiple
PL components, including DSPs, LUTs, buffers, and routing
resources. VCCBRAM is accessible with PMBus address 0x14
and Vnom = 850mV ; it supplies the BRAMs of the PL. To ac-
cess these voltage rails for monitoring and regulation, we use
a PMBus adapter and the provided API [65]. Using a similar
approach and different PMBus commands, we monitor the
power consumption of each voltage rail as well as the on-chip
temperature.

4. Experimental Results
We present and analyze our experimental results from reduced-
voltage operation on FPGA boards. These results are collected
at ambient temperature. Section 7 presents further temperature
analysis. Each result presented in this paper is the average of
10 experiments, in order to account for any variation between
different experiments; although, the variation we observed
was negligible.
4.1. Power Analysis of FPGA-based CNN Accelerators at
the Nominal Voltage Level (Vnom)
We measure the total on-chip power consumption of the base-
line conﬁguration to be an average of 12.59W for benchmarks,
at the nominal voltage level (Vnom) and ambient temperature.
This value includes the power consumption at on-chip volt-
age rails, including VCCBRAM and VCCINT . We observe that

internal FPGA components on the VCCINT rail dissipate more
than 99.9% of this on-chip power. We believe this obser-
vation is due to power-efﬁcient BRAM designs, using tech-
niques like dynamic power gating [124], in modern Ultrascale+
FPGA platforms, including in the studied ZCU102 FPGA.
Older generations of Xilinx FPGAs like the 7-series are not
equipped with this capability [121]. Thus, for such older
devices, BRAM power consumption was the main source
of FPGA power consumption, as shown in previous stud-
ies [1, 96, 97, 99]. For the rest of the paper, as we study the
power-reliability trade-off, we concentrate on VCCINT due to
its dominance in FPGA power consumption.
4.2. Overall Voltage Behavior
Our experiments reveal that a large voltage guardband be-
low Vnom exists for VCCINT , as shown in Figure 3 for three
hardware platforms and ﬁve CNN benchmarks. In the volt-
age guardband region, as we reduce supply voltage there is
no performance or reliability degradation, and thus, under
normal conditions, eliminating this voltage guardband can
lead to signiﬁcant power savings without any overhead. As
Figure 3 shows, we measure the average guardband amount
to be 850mV − 570mV = 280mV , with a slight variation
across different benchmarks.
In other words, we observe
that Vmin = 570mV (on average) is the minimum safe voltage
level of the accelerator, where there is no accuracy loss. As
we further undervolt below Vmin, we enter a region called the
critical region in which the reliability of the hardware and, in
turn, the accuracy of the CNN starts to decrease signiﬁcantly.
As Figure 3 depicts, we measure the average critical voltage
region size, to be 570mV − 540mv = 30mV , with a slight vari-
ation across different benchmarks. As we further undervolt
below Vmin, we reach a point at which the FPGA does not re-
spond to requests and it is not functional. This point is called
Vcrash. We ﬁnd that Vcrash = 540mV on average, with a slight
variation across different hardware platforms.
Figure 4 illustrates the overall behavior we observe for the
power-efﬁciency and CNN accuracy trade-off on our FPGA-
based CNN accelerator. As we perform undervolting, the
FPGA enters the guardband region, where we observe no relia-
bility degradation (i.e., CNN accuracy loss), and therefore, the
power-efﬁciency comes with no cost. We observe this behav-
ior until we reach the point Vmin, i.e., minimum safe voltage
level. With further undervolting, the FPGA enters the critical
region, where power-efﬁciency constantly increases, but we
start to observe fast-increasing CNN accuracy loss. When we
undervolt down to a speciﬁc point, called Vcrash, the FPGA
becomes non-functional and starts to hang. Sections 4.3 and
4.4 provide more details on the power-reliability trade-off. Our
demonstration is on three identical samples of Xilinx ZCU102.
However, we believe that the overall voltage behavior, illus-
trated in Figure 4, is reproducible for other FPGA platforms
as well.

4.3. Detailed Power-Efﬁciency Analysis
Figure 5 presents the power-efﬁciency experimental results
(GOPs/W ) for ﬁve CNN workloads, averaged across three
FPGA hardware platforms. The power-efﬁciency gain at Vcrash
is more than 3X of that at nominal voltage level, i.e., Vnom,
for the same design of the given CNN accelerator. 2.6X of
the gain in power-efﬁciency is the result of eliminating the
voltage guardband without any CNN accuracy loss. 43%
further power-efﬁciency gain is due to further undervolting
in the critical region, which has an associated CNN accuracy
loss cost.

variation (averaged across three hardware platforms).

The power-efﬁciency gain via undervolting until Vmin is
not application-dependent, so it is useful for any applica-
tion mapped onto the same FPGA. However, the reliabil-
ity overhead in the critical region below Vmin is application-
dependent due to different vulnerability levels of different
applications/workloads.
4.4. Detailed Reliability Analysis
As we undervolt until Vmin, there is no reliability overhead.
However, as we further undervolt below Vmin, the reliability
of the hardware is signiﬁcantly affected due to the further
increase in datapath delay. The effect of the reliability loss
is fully application-dependent due to different inherent re-
silience levels of different applications. In this paper, we study
this effect on several CNN workloads. Figure 6 depicts our
experimental results. As shown before, as we reduce the sup-
ply voltage, power-efﬁciency improves. When we reduce the
supply voltage below Vmin, we observe that the accuracy of
all benchmarks gradually reduces. With further undervolting,
when the supply voltage reaches an average of Vcrash = 540mV
across different platforms and benchmarks, the accuracy of the
benchmarks drops greatly, and the classiﬁer behaves randomly.
Our experiments show that benchmarks with more parameters,
e.g., ResNet and Inception are relatively more vulnerable to
undervolting faults below Vmin. Also, as seen, there is a vari-
ation of ΔVmin = 31mV and ΔVcrash = 18mV across different
FPGAs. This variation can be due to the process variation
across different FPGAs.
5. Frequency Underscaling
As shown earlier, in the critical voltage region below the guard-
band, CNN classiﬁcation accuracy dramatically decreases. In
this section, we aim to overcome this accuracy loss by ex-
ploiting frequency underscaling. To be more precise, we aim
to ﬁnd a more energy-efﬁcient voltage setting than the un-
dervolted Vmin, which also provides accurate results. To this
end, for each supply voltage setting below Vmin, we aim to
identify the maximum frequency value Fmax with which the
system does not experience any accuracy loss. When we ﬁnd
this frequency point, we evaluate the energy efﬁciency of the
system. As we underscale the frequency of the system, the
performance of the application reduces. Therefore, we use the
GOPs/J metric as it accommodates for both performance and
energy consumption.
Table 2 summarizes the results of the frequency underscal-
ing in the critical region. These experiments are based on
frequency and voltage steps of 25Mhz and 5mV , respectively.
The column VCCINT corresponds to the supply voltage of a
given setting. The column Fmax corresponds to the maximum
frequency at which there is no accuracy loss. The remaining
columns: GOPs, Power, GOPS/W , GOPS/J are normalized
to the respective values of executing the system in the default
setting VCCINT = Vmin = 570mV,Fmax = 333Mhz which are
the baseline settings of our accelerator. Table 2 indicates that
multiple voltage settings VCCINT map to the same operating
Frequency Fmax: supply voltages between 560mV to 545mV
require the same frequency of Fmax = 250Mhz. This is because
the frequency step we use is 25Mhz. Using smaller steps of
frequency can lead to more spread-out Fmax values.

accuracy loss in the critical voltage region (averaged across
three hardware platforms). Best result with frequency under-
scaling in terms of each metric is marked in blue.

For all the combinations of (Vi,Fi) that provide error-free
results presented in Table 2 in the critical region, power de-
creases with decreasing Vi < Vmin and Fi < Fmax. This is be-
cause we decrease both the supply voltage and the operating
frequency. However, at the same time, this leads to decreas-
ing the system performance. Consequently, the best voltage-
frequency combination in terms of energy-efﬁciency (GOPs/J)
is the one with the highest frequency of Fmax = 333Mhz, which
also is our baseline. In other words, it is not worth to under-
scale the frequency and voltage to ﬁnd a more energy-efﬁcient
optimal point. However, as a trade-off, the design is more
power-efﬁcient (i.e., has higher GOPs/W ) at lower voltage-
frequency levels, up to 25% at Vcrash = 540mV .
