## 3.1.3 Identity Data
### Identity Data: Measurement Methodology
To assess the prevalence of potential identity data, we measured the number of potential Social Security Numbers (SSNs) seen over the logged period. We verified that the numbers fall within the issued range as listed by the Social Security Administration, but were unable to confirm whether the numbers had indeed been issued. Previous research has shown that an SSN is sufficient to steal an individual’s identity, making a publicly released SSN a significant risk for identity theft [8].

### Identity Data: Measurement Results
The results of our measurements are presented in Table 4. A total of 19,521 SSNs were identified, representing 0.15% of the corpus. In Section 3.1, we used random sampling to estimate that 0.40% of the messages in the corpus contain SSNs, which is a reasonable estimate. The majority of potential SSNs are repeats, with 3,902 unique values, and 3,808 of these fall within the range of currently issued SSNs. We randomly sampled around 3% of the unique in-range cards and cross-checked them against the StolenIDSearch database, finding a single match.

| Card Type         | Counts  |
|-------------------|---------|
| New               | 3,902   |
| New In-Range      | 3,808   |
| New Out-of-Range  | 94      |
| Repeats           | 15,619  |

**Table 4: Identity (SSN) statistics.**

After inspecting the random sample, we found that 95% of the lines are explicitly labeled as SSNs. This suggests that the miscreants posting the cards believe in their validity or are attempting to pass them off as valid.

### Identity Data Rate: Measurement Methodology
In addition to establishing the number of SSNs in the channel and validating our prevalence estimate from Section 3.1, we measured the rate at which new in-range SSNs enter the channel and the rate at which previously seen cards are repeated.

### Identity Data Rate: Measurement Results
New in-range SSNs arrive at an average rate of 18.6 cards per day, while repeated SSNs arrive at an average rate of 76 cards per day. The majority of SSNs are repeated fewer than 3 times, and 95% of cards are repeated 17 times or less. The results of our measurements are presented in Figure 5.

## 3.1.4 Estimating the Wealth of Miscreants
### Wealth: Measurement Methodology
To estimate the wealth stolen by the miscreants in this market, we added the potential losses from credit card fraud and financial account theft. Since the number of cards held in reserve is difficult to estimate, we used the number of cards with valid Luhn digits pasted to the channel. As an estimate for the amount of funds lost per card, we used the median loss amount for credit/debit fraud of $427.50 per card, as reported in the 2006 Internet Crime Complaint Center’s Internet Crime Report [6]. Our estimate assumes that all the card numbers with valid Luhn digits were active when posted to the channel and that they incur an average loss of $427.50. We also assume that the financial accounts seen are valid and that all funds in the financial accounts are lost.

### Wealth: Measurement Results
With these estimates and assumptions, the total wealth generated from credit card fraud in the channel is over $37,000,000. If we include the financial account data from Section 3.1.2, the total exceeds $93,000,000. While these numbers likely overestimate the wealth generated by the sensitive data posted to the channel, it is possible that market participants have many additional cards and financial accounts that they do not give away for free, making the estimated wealth only a fraction of the true value.

## 3.2 Market Participation
Having established the market being studied as an active market with significant levels of illegal activity, we now focus on the market’s participants. We start by establishing a baseline activity level of the number of new and repeated messages posted per day. We measure the number of participants per day, including new and old participants, and the active lifetime of a participant over the logged period. We conclude by correlating participants' IP addresses with IPs known to send spam, be infected with malware, or be open proxies.

### 3.2.1 Activity Levels
#### Messages: Measurement Methodology
We measured the new and repeated messages per day. We manually checked outliers by randomly sampling to verify that the messages are the result of normal activity rather than message floods or other disruptive activity.

#### Messages: Measurement Results
Figure 6 shows the number of new and repeated messages per day. On average, over 64,000 messages are seen each day. The average number of new messages per day is greater than 19,000. After removing outliers corresponding to bursts of activity around day 50, the average rate of new messages per day drops to around 13,000. Repeated messages primarily originate from automated advertising scripts and arrive at an average rate of over 45,000 messages per day. These scripts repeat the same message at regular intervals to advertise the goods and services of sellers who may not be present at their terminals. Automated sales ads are common and on most days constitute a majority of total channel messages.

### 3.2.2 Participant Identification
#### Identifiers: Measurement Methodology
To assess the number of participants who contribute to the market each day, we measured the number of nicks (new and previously seen) who contributed at least one message to the market on a particular day. The number of nicks is not necessarily the same as the number of unique users since participants are not limited to using a single nick at a time. Scripts and automated bots also use nicks. In addition to the nicks seen in the logs, each market channel typically has a large number of lurkers who remain idle, sending zero public messages. These lurkers may be buyers who monitor channel ads and only contact sellers through private messages, leechers looking for free financial data, or fraud prevention services such as CardCops.2 Our measurements do not include lurkers.

#### Identifiers: Measurement Results
Figure 7 shows the results of our measurements. There were a total of 113,000 unique nicks seen over the monitored period. On an average day, there are over 1,500 active nicks participating in the market. The majority of these nicks have been previously active in the channel at some time in the past. New nicks arrive at an average rate of 553 nicks per day.

### Active Lifetime: Measurement Methodology
Given the large number of previously seen nicks that operate in the channel, it is interesting to ask how long these nicks remain active. We measured the active lifetime of each nick, defined as the time between the nick’s first and last message. Active lifetimes are useful to assess the extent to which participants build relationships by maintaining a nick over a long period versus creating new identities.

### Active Lifetime: Measurement Results
Figure 8 shows the active lifetimes of nicks on a logarithmic scale. 25% of all active nicks posted a single message to the channel, giving them an active lifetime of zero. The majority of nicks have a short active lifetime of less than 40 minutes, while 95% of nicks have an active lifetime of less than 2,700 hours (112.5 days). The relatively long active lifetime of some nicks suggests that building relationships by maintaining a nick is a common and potentially lucrative practice.

### Client IP Lookups: Measurement Methodology
The second form of client identity that we measured is a client’s IP address. We extracted a total of 65,513 IP addresses from the corpus and checked the addresses against several blacklists. The first blacklist, the Spamhaus Block List (SBL)3, is a "realtime database of IP addresses of verified spam sources and spam operations (including spammers, spam gangs, and spam support services)." The second blacklist, the Exploits Block List (XBL), is a "realtime database of IP addresses of illegal third-party exploits, including open proxies (HTTP, socks, AnalogX, wingate, etc.), worms/viruses with built-in spam engines, and other types of trojan-horse exploits." The XBL is composed of two lists: the Composite Block List (CBL)4 and the NJABL5 open proxy IPs list. Open proxies are commonly used to hide a client’s IP address from law enforcement, which may be monitoring a channel. The CBL catalogs IPs active in spam-related activities as a result of infection by bots or other malware.

### Client IP Lookups: Measurement Results
Table 5 shows the results of querying the blacklists. While 90% of the IPs are not on any blacklist, 10% are listed on the CBL, suggesting that compromised hosts are being used to connect to the market. 1% of client IPs are on the SBL, suggesting possible spamming activities, and 1% are listed as open proxies.

| BlackList       | IPs On List | Percentage |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| XBL (CBL)       | 6,528       | 10%        |
| XBL (NJABL)     | 939         | 1%         |
| SBL             | 788         | 1%         |
| –               | 60,305      | 90%        |

### 3.2.3 Verified Status
The participants of the market operate in an environment of dishonesty and mutual distrust. Buyers and sellers must protect themselves from dishonest participants (a.k.a., “rippers”) who purposely fail to uphold their end of a transaction. Such ripping behavior is common in other online markets and has led to the establishment of reputation systems such as those found on eBay or Amazon Marketplace. Not surprisingly, establishing reputation in this underground market differs from traditional reputation establishment in online marketplaces.

The primary mechanism to build credibility is by providing high-quality data "samples" that can be verified by a third party. The prevalence of free samples is part of what makes the existence of credit cards common in channel logs. After providing a sufficient number of verifiable samples of sensitive data, the channel's administrators consider a seller to be verified and give their nick a special designation, +v (the 'voice' attribute), as a seal of approval. The validity of samples can be verified by performing a minimal cost transaction with the card, such as donating $1 to a charity of the miscreant’s choice. The channel administration actively campaigns for transactions to take place between verified participants—both sales and want ads carry notices that only transactions with verified participants will be accepted.

#### Verified Status: Measurement Methodology
To better understand how a participant receives a verified status, we measured the number of credit cards posted by clients who provided at least one card during the monitored period. We used the client portion of the source identifier, including the nick and username, to distinguish clients. Results using other portions of the source identifier to distinguish clients gave similar results.

#### Verified Status: Measurement Results
Figure 9 presents our results. The majority of clients who post sensitive data do so in small amounts, and 95% post fewer than 18 samples. These measurements suggest that participants, particularly sellers, need only post a small number of sensitive data samples to achieve verified status.

## 3.3 Market Services and Treachery
The channel service bot is an interactive script run by channel administrators for the purpose of providing useful services such as credit card limit checks and access to a BIN list. Table 6 describes commonly issued commands.

### Command Distribution: Measurement Methodology
We used syntactic matches to measure the number of times common commands were issued.
