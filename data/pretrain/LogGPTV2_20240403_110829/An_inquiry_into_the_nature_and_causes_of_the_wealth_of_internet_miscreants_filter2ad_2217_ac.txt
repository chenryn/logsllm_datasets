3.1.3 Identity Data
Identity Data: Measurement Methodology. To assess the preva-
lence of potential identity data, we measure potential SSNs seen
over the logged period. We check that the numbers fall within the
issued range as listed by the Social Security Administration, but
are unable to verify that the numbers were indeed already issued.
Previous work has shown that an SSN is sufﬁcient to steal an indi-
vidual’s identity, hence a publicly released SSN could put an indi-
vidual at risk for identity theft [8].

Table 4: Identity (SSN) statistics.
Identity Data: Measurement Results. The results of our mea-
surements are presented in Table 4. A total of 19,521 SSNs are
identiﬁed or 0.15% of the corpus. In Section 3.1 we use random
sampling to estimate that 0.40% of the messages in the corpus con-
tain SSNs; again, this value is a reasonable estimate. The majority
of potential SSNs are repeats with 3,902 unique values and 3,808 of
these within the range of currently issued SSNs. We randomly sam-
ple around 3% of the unique in-range cards and cross-check them
against the StolenIDSearch database. We found a single match.
After inspecting the random sample, we found that 95% of the
lines are explicitly labeled as SSNs. This ﬁnding suggests that the
miscreants posting the cards believe the validity of the cards they
posted, or are attempting to pass them off as valid.
Identity Data Rate: Measurement Methodology.
In addition
to establishing the number of SSNs in the channel and validating
our prevalence estimate from Section 3.1, we measure the rate at
which new in-range SSNs enter the channel and the rate at which
previously seen cards are repeated.
Identity Data Rate: Measurement Results. New in-range SSNs
arrive at an average rate of 18.6 cards per day. Repeated SSNs
arrive at an average rate of 76 cards per day. The majority of SSNs
are repeated fewer than 3 times and 95% of cards are repeated 17
times or less. The results of our measurements are presented in
Figure 5.
3.1.4 Estimating the Wealth of Miscreants
Wealth: Measurement Methodology. To approach an estimate
for the wealth stolen by the miscreants in this market, we add the
potential losses from credit card fraud and ﬁnancial account theft.
Since the number of cards held in reserve is difﬁcult to estimate, we
use the number of cards with valid Luhn digits pasted to the chan-
nel. As an estimate for the amount of funds lost per card, we use
the median loss amount for credit/debit fraud of $427.50 per card
as reported in the 2006 Internet Crime Complaint Center’s Internet
Crime Report [6]. Our estimate assumes that all the card numbers
with valid Luhn digits were active when posted to the channel and
that the they incur an average loss of $427.50. We also assume
that the ﬁnancial accounts seen are valid and that all funds in the
ﬁnancial accounts are lost.
Wealth: Measurement Results. With these estimates and as-
sumptions, the total wealth generated from credit card fraud in the
channel is over $37,000,000. If we include the ﬁnancial account
data from Section 3.1.2, we arrive at a total of over $93,000,000.
While these numbers likely overestimate the wealth generated by
the sensitive data posted to the channel, it is possible that mar-
ket participants have many additional cards and ﬁnancial accounts
which they do not give away for free. This fact could make the es-
timated wealth established in this section only a fraction of the true
value.

3.2 Market Participation
Having established the market being studied as an active mar-
ket with signiﬁcant levels of illegal activity, we shift our focus to
the market’s participants. We start by establishing a baseline activ-
ity level of the number of new and repeated messages posted per
day. We measure the number of participants per day including new
and old participants and the active lifetime of a participant over the
logged period. We ﬁnish by correlating participant’s IP addresses
with IPs known to send spam, be infected with malware, or be open
proxies.
3.2.1 Activity Levels
Messages: Measurement Methodology. We measure the new
and repeated messages per day. We manually checked outliers by
randomly sampling to verify that the messages are the result of nor-
mal activity rather than message ﬂoods or other disruptive activity.

Figure 6: Message statistics.
Messages: Measurement Results. Figure 6 shows the number of
new and repeated messages per day. On average, over 64,000 mes-
sages are seen each day. The average number of new messages per
day is greater than 19,000. After removing outliers corresponding
to bursts of activity around day 50, the average rate of new mes-
sages per day drops to around 13,000. Repeated messages origi-
nate primarily from automated advertising scripts and arrive at an
average rate of over 45,000 messages per day. These scripts repeat
the same message at regular intervals to advertise the goods and
services of sellers who may not be present at their terminals. Au-
tomated sales ads are common and on most days they constitute a
majority of total channel messages.
3.2.2 Participant Identiﬁcation
Identiﬁers: Measurement Methodology. To assess the number
of participants who contribute to the market each day, we measure
the number of nicks (new and previously seen) who contributed
at least one message to the market on a particular day. The num-
ber of nicks is not necessarily the same as the number of unique
users since participants are not limited to using a single nick at a
time. Scripts and automated bots also use nicks. In addition to the
nicks seen in the logs, each market channel typically has a large
number of lurkers who remain idle, sending zero public messages.
These lurkers may be buyers who monitor channel ads and only
contact sellers through private messages, leechers looking for free
ﬁnancial data, or fraud prevention services such as CardCops.2 Our
measurements do not include lurkers.

Figure 7: Participation by IRC nicks.
Identiﬁers: Measurement Results. Figure 7 shows the results of
our measurements. There were a total of 113,000 unique nicks seen
over the monitored period. On an average day there are over 1,500
active nicks participating in the market. The majority of these nicks
have been previously active in the channel at some time in the past.
New nicks arrive at an average rate of 553 nicks per day.
Active Lifetime: Measurement Methodology. Given the large
number of previously seen nicks that operate in the channel, it is
interesting to ask how long these nicks remain active. We measure
the active lifetime of each nick, deﬁned as the time between the
nick’s ﬁrst and last message. Active lifetimes are useful to assess
the extent to which participants build relationships by maintaining
a nick over a long period versus creating new identities.

Figure 9: CDF of data samples posted by participants.
Active Lifetime: Measurement Results. Figure 8 shows the ac-
tive lifetimes of nicks on a logarithmic scale. 25% of all active
nicks posted a single message to the channel, giving them an active
lifetime of zero. The majority of nicks have a short active life-
time of less than 40 minutes while 95% of nicks have an active
lifetime of less than 2,700 hours (112.5 days). The relatively long
active lifetime of some nicks suggests that building relationships by
maintaining a nick is a common and potentially lucrative practice.
Client IP Lookups: Measurement Methodology.
The second
form of client identity that we measure is a client’s IP address.
We extracted a total of 65,513 IP addresses from the corpus and
check the addresses against several blacklists. The ﬁrst blacklist,
the Spamhaus Block List (SBL)3, is a “realtime database of IP ad-
dresses of veriﬁed spam sources and spam operations (including
spammers, spam gangs and spam support services).” The second
blacklist, the Exploits Block List (XBL), is a “realtime database of
IP addresses of illegal 3rd party exploits, including open proxies
(HTTP, socks, AnalogX, wingate, etc), worms/viruses with built-in
spam engines, and other types of trojan-horse exploits.” The XBL
is composed of two lists: the Composite Block List (CBL)4 and
the NJABL5 open proxy IPs list. Open proxies are commonly used
to hide a client’s IP address from law enforcement which may be
monitoring a channel. The CBL catalogs IPs active in spam-related
activities as a result of infection by bots or other malware.

mised hosts are being used to connect to the market. 1% of client
IPs are on the SBL suggesting possible spamming activities and 1%
are listed as open proxies.

3.2.3 Veriﬁed Status
The participants of the market operate in an environment of dis-
honesty and mutual distrust. Buyers and sellers must protect them-
selves from dishonest participants (a.k.a., “rippers”) who purposely
fail to uphold their end of a transaction. Such ripping behavior is
common in other online markets and has lead to the establishment
of reputation systems such as those found on eBay or Amazon Mar-
ketplace. Not surprisingly, establishing reputation in this under-
ground market differs from traditional reputation establishment in
online market places.
The primary mechanism to build credibility is by providing high-
quality data “samples” which can be veriﬁed by a third party. The
prevalence of free samples is part of what makes the existence of
credit cards common in channel logs. After providing a sufﬁcient
number of veriﬁable samples of sensitive data, the channel’s admin-
istrators consider a seller to be veriﬁed and give their nick a special
designation, +v (the ’voice’ attribute), as a seal of approval. The
validity of samples can be veriﬁed by performing a minimal cost
transaction with the card, such as donating $1 to a charity of the
miscreant’s choice. The channel administration actively campaign
for transactions to take place between veriﬁed participants – both
sales and want ads carry notices that only transactions with veriﬁed
participants will be accepted.
Veriﬁed Status: Measurement Methodology. To better under-
stand how a participant receives a veriﬁed status, we measure the
number of credit cards posted by clients who provide at least one
card during the monitored period. We use the client portion of the
source identiﬁer, including the nick and username, to distinguish
clients. Results using other portions of the source identiﬁer to dis-
tinguish client gave similar results.
Veriﬁed Status: Measurement Results.
Figure 9 presents our
results. The majority of clients who post sensitive data do so in
small amounts and 95% post fewer than 18 samples. These mea-
surements suggest that participants, in particular sellers, need only
post a small number of sensitive data samples to achieve veriﬁed
status.
3.3 Market Services and Treachery
The channel service bot is an interactive script run by channel
administrators for the purpose of providing useful services such as
credit card limit checks and access to a BIN list. Table 6 describes
commonly issued commands.
Command Distribution: Measurement Methodology. We use
syntactic matches to measure the number of times common com-
mands were issued.
