### Leveraging User Input for Auditing Book Texts

We propose a system that enables users to auditize words from books, similar in concept to reCAPTCHAs. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of text digitization but also introduces an additional layer of security and quality assurance.

### Broader Threats to Voice Privacy

Our work highlights a more general and broader threat to "voice privacy." Malicious actors could potentially record voice samples and use them to compromise security and privacy in other applications, such as Cfones or voice recognition systems. While individuals are often concerned about their visual privacy (e.g., someone taking their picture), they may not consider their voice to be equally sensitive. People frequently speak out loud in public places like restaurants and even engage with strangers, which can make it easier for audio sensors to capture their voices without explicit effort, unlike cameras.

### Potential Defenses and Challenges

#### Multi-Channel Validation
One potential defense against our attacks on Cfones is to use multiple perceptory channels instead of relying solely on audio. For example, users could be asked to validate verbal SAS by also paying attention to the accompanying video. If the attacker performs voice impersonation, the user might detect the attack by noticing the lack of synchronization between the spoken SAS and the lip movement of the person on the video. However, this approach presents significant challenges:
- **User Attention**: Users may not be in a position to look at the video or may not pay enough attention to spot the lack of audio-visual synchronization.
- **Video Manipulation**: Attackers could manipulate both audio and video packets, making it difficult to detect the attack. Prior research has shown that image and video morphing attacks are feasible [52].

#### Automated Voice Recognition
Another potential defense is to integrate an automated voice recognition or biometric system into Cfones. This system could detect potential SAS forgeries. However, achieving robust detection rates (low false negatives and low false positives) remains a challenge. Additionally, existing voice biometric systems may not effectively thwart active voice impersonation and synthesis attacks [26]. The short duration of the SAS challenge (only a few seconds) may not provide sufficient data for the biometric system to extract meaningful features.

#### Auxiliary Channels
A third potential solution is to perform SAS validation over an auxiliary channel that is more resistant to voice and packet manipulation, such as PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) communication. If the communicating devices support both VoIP and PSTN connectivity, non-SAS communication can take place over VoIP, while SAS validation can occur over PSTN. This mechanism is suitable for mobile phones, where the Cfone app can switch to a PSTN call during SAS comparison. A limitation of this approach is that it is only applicable to devices with PSTN capability.

#### Dynamic Dictionaries
Increasing the dictionary size to make reordering difficult and reducing the efficiency of automatic keyword spotting is another independent defense. If the dictionary is not fixed, reordering becomes impossible. One idea is to choose words from a large dynamic space, such as the front pages of today’s newspapers. The dictionary can be chosen by users or programmatically during key exchange. However, the security and user experience of this approach need further investigation.

#### Network Route Fingerprinting
Finally, the method proposed by Balasubramaniyan et al. [14] identifies and characterizes the network route traversed by the voice signal, creating detailed fingerprints for the call source. For VoIP connections, this method is based on network characteristics and may only be effective if the attacker and the victim reside in different networks.

### Conclusions

Crypto Phones aim to establish end-to-end secure communications via a peer-to-peer mechanism. However, their security relies on the assumption that the voice channel, over which short checksums are validated, provides integrity and authenticity. We challenged this assumption and developed two forms of short voice impersonation attacks: reordering and morphing. These attacks can compromise the security of Crypto Phones in both two-party and multi-party settings. Our evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of these attacks compared to a trivial attack where the attacker impersonates with a completely different voice. We suggested potential ways and associated challenges to improve the security of Crypto Phones against voice MITM attacks. Comprehensive future investigations are needed to develop viable mechanisms to thwart such attacks.
