This is a talk about sensor communication wires.
● Alarm systems and access control first
● Defeating line supervision and end-of-line resistors
○ Surrogate Resistor
○ Voltage Regulation
● Defenses

Alarm Zones
Zone 1 - NC
Zone 2 - NC
Zone 3 - NO
Pick the lock
Unscrew the enclosure casing and 
jumper out the lines
Blue team: put the keyswitch on the 
secure side of the door; use a lock 
of equal or higher security as the 
door; install a tamper switch.
Red Team Attacks - Binary Sensor Comms Lines - Normally Closed
Switch open - controller sees high impedance - alarm
Switch closed - controller sees low impedance - no alarm
Switch open, line jumpered - controller sees low impedance - no alarm
Red Team Attacks - Binary Sensor Comms Lines - Normally Open
Switch open - controller sees high impedance - no alarm
Switch closed - controller sees low impedance - alarm
Switch closed, line cut - controller sees high impedance - no alarm
Blue Team Defense - Binary Sensor Comms Lines
Vulnerable - put voltage across line, listen for high / low impedance
Less vulnerable - put voltage across line, listen for impedance in range
Switch between two different resistances (wire one series, one parallel)

Zener: effect changes with temperature; not well suited for outdoor applications if 
a high breakdown voltage (Avalanche effect dominates)
5.6V breakdown: Zener and Avalanche effect approximately equal, temperature 
coefficients cancel. 
Low breakdown voltage: Zener effect dominates; much more rounded knee at 
breakdown.  Less well suited - use resistive if possible.
