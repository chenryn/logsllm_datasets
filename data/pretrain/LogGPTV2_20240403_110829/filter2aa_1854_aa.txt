Importance of Water
•
Water is essential for life. 
•
Water is a scarce commodity
•
Water has been a source of conflict 
and war throughout human history. 
•
Water is a $400 billion global 
industry. Water has been called “the 
new oil.” 
•
Al Qaeda has repeatedly threatened 
to “poison” United States drinking 
water supplies.
•
Water is a critical infrastructure.
•
However, the American Society of 
Civil Engineers gives the nation’s 
drinking water infrastructure a D-
grade and estimates that an 
investment of $255 billion is needed 
to bring the system to needed 
standards

Water Meter = Cash Register 
•
Water Bill based on the difference 
between “present reading” and 
“previous reading”, which is 
“usage”
•
Usage x water rates = usage charge
•
$40 billion – the annual income of 
US water utilities, mostly from 
meter information
•
Average monthly water bill ranges 
from $34.29 a month in Phoenix 
compared to $65.47 in Boston for a 
family of four using 100 gallons per 
person each day.
•
The revenue is very important to 
support day to day operations as 
well as capital replacement which 
nationally is billions behind 
schedule.

What could go wrong?
The June, 2011 audit of the Brockton, 
Mass. Water & Sewer Department found 
that :
•
most of the City’s meters were 15 
years or older, 
•
from FY2006 through FY2010 
approximately 25% of the water bills 
were not based on reading the meter 
but were estimated readings, and 
that 
•
the billing staff did not have sufficient 
training in using the system. 
The audit was called for by the City 
Council following the issuance of 
numerous retroactive bills to residents, 
resulting in one case of a water bill of 
$97,000 for one homeowner.

Meter Tampering for Money
• Energy theft costs consumers 
billions of dollars every year in 
the United States alone
• Electric utilities assume 10% 
loss each year from theft
• “Theft of water by tampering 
with or bypassing water 
meters costs BWSC [Boston] 
thousands of dollars a year & 
.. imposes costs every paying 
customer.”

Water Meter Engineering
•
How does the meter itself work?
•
Displacement
–
Oscillating Piston
–
Nutating Disk
•
Velocity
–
Single jet (Paddle wheel)
–
Multijet (Horizontal impeller)
–
Turbine
–
Propeller
•
Ultrasonic meters measure the difference of the 
transit time of ultrasonic pulses propagating in and 
against flow direction
•
Electromagnetic flow meters operate based upon 
Faraday's Law of induction, which states that a 
voltage will be induced in a conductor moving 
through a magnetic field.
Faraday's Law: E=kBDV
Common types of water meters
•
Multi-jet Meter
•
Single-jet Meter
•
Positive Displacement Meter
•
Turbine Meter
•
Compound Meter
•
Fire Meter
•
Fire Hydrant Meter
•
Electromagnetic or Mag Meter
•
Ultrasonic Meter

Data collection: Register
• Meters are data collection 
devices
• Data shown on “register”
• Data is total volume of 
water thru the meter 
since it was installed
• Interval readings turn it 
into information
• The less time between 
readings, the more 
information collected
8
Data Collection Methods
•
Eyeball. This is the legacy method 
which requires a meter reader to 
physically enter the premises and 
read the meter, usually in the 
basement. 
•
Walk-By. The meter is connected 
with wires to a device located on the 
outside of the building, so even 
though a physical visit by a meter 
reader is still required he does not 
have to enter the building
•
Drive-By. The meter is retrofitted 
with, or already comes with, a radio 
frequency transmitter, that is read 
by the meter reader in his vehicle as 
he drives past all the metered 
buildings on his route.

Data Collection – Fixed Network
•
The fixed network is what we usually 
think of when we talk about 
Automatic Meter Reading or Smart 
Meter
•
This takes the full capabilities of the 
wireless water meter and enables it 
to become a sensor network for the 
water utility that can allow almost 
continuous water usage readings 
(usually every 5-15 minutes).
•
In the fixed network the signals from 
the single meter are transmitted and 
then collected in a central receiving 
station, if close enough, or to 
repeaters and then to the central 
receiving station. 
•
In most cases a star topology is used, 
but in some implementations a mesh 
topology is used to each meter can 
act as a repeater for any others 
within range.
10
Basic Network Components
• Wireless transmitter or 
transceiver on the meter
• Collector, receiver or 
transceiver; (drive-by or 
static location)
• Central collector  
receiver/transceiver
• Billing office computer 
system
11
Wireless Water Meter is…
• Embedded device
• Node in Sensor network
• Information collection 
device
• Electronic cash register
• Regulator of availability 
of drinking water
• Water conservation 
device
• Big Brother?
12
Types of Wireless Water Meters
• No standards
• 25+ major 
manufacturers, each 
with small market share
• Data transmission:
- Phone lines
- Cable
- Power Lines
- Radio frequency
- Combination

Growth of Smart Water Meters
•
The U.S. advanced metering 
infrastructure (AMI) market 
[electricity+gas+water] will grow 
from $2.54 billion in 2010 to $5.82 
billion in 2015 -- an 18% compound 
annual growth rate
•
The world smart water meter 
market is expected to total $4.2 
billion between 2010 and 2016. 
•
The worldwide installed base of 
smart water meters is expected to 
increase from 5.2 million in 2009 to 
31.8 million by 2016.
•
Most water meters in the US are 
read manually; only 28 percent of 
water utilities have AMR meters.
•
About 50% of California water 
utilities have smart meters, driven 
by state mandate to cut water 
consumption 20% by 2020..
14
Benefits of AMR/AMI to Utility
• Lower meter reading cost
• Better identify leaks
• Unaccounted-for water
• Detect evasion of water 
use restrictions
• Better accuracy
• Allows monthly billing
• Resolve bill disputes
• Customer service
• Water conservation
15
Water “Smart Grid” Real Benefits
The real benefits of the Smart Grid for 
Water lie in aggregative, integrative, and 
derivative information
A meter read is not just a meter read. It: 
•
forms a key part of the billing record; 
•
forms a fundamental part of the leak 
loss (pumped versus billed) analysis; 
•
establishes peak and average 
demand parameters; 
•
is a key measure of the performance 
of water conservation activities; 
•
forms the basis for feedback to the 
consumer directly on their impact on 
resources; and 
•
is the foundation for key reporting 
elements associated with regulatory 
requirements such as compliance 
with California’s 20 x 2020 Water 
Conservation Plan.”
16
Wireless Sensor Network
•
A wireless water meter network is a kind of 
Wireless Sensor Network, which is defined as 
•
“a large network of resource-constrained 
sensor nodes with multiple preset function, 
such as sensing and processing… the major 
elements of a WSN are the sensor nodes and 
the base station.” 
•
Each individual water meter is a “sensor 
node.”
•
WSN Inherent Vulnerabilities:
-
the wireless medium itself,
-
unattended operation, 
-
random topology, and 
-
hard to protect against insider attacks
•
Processor. A typical sensor node processor is 
of 4-8 MHz, having 4KB of RAM, 128KB flash 
and ideally 916 MHz of radio frequency. 
•
Energy: Sensor nodes typically have a small 
form factor with a limited amount of battery 
power. 
•
Memory: Sensor nodes usually have a small 
amount of memory. Hence, sensor network 
protocols should not require the storage of a 
large amount of information at the sensor 
node. 
17
Potential Attacks on WSN’s
• Wireless Sensor Networks 
are subject to a wide 
range of potential attacks
• Active vs. Passive Attacks
• Outsider vs. Insider
• Mote class vs. Laptop class
• Interruption
• Interception
• Modification
• Replay attacks
18
WSN Countermeasures
• Link layer encryption 
and authentication
• Multipath routing
• Identity verification
• Bidirectional link 
verification
• Authenticated 
broadcast
19
Wireless Meter Electronics
• Have off the shelf 
microcontrollers & 
transceivers
• Texas Instruments, 
Atmel, Microchip, etc.
• The trick is to find out 
which one is in a 
particular meter.
• Run on batteries, 
usually 5-20 yrs lifespan
