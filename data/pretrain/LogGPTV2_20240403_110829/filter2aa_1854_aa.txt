## 2. Importance of Water
- **Essential for Life:** Water is vital for human survival.
- **Scarce Resource:** Water is a limited commodity.
- **Historical Conflicts:** Water has been a source of conflict and war throughout history.
- **Economic Impact:** The global water industry is valued at $400 billion, often referred to as "the new oil."
- **Security Concerns:** Al Qaeda has repeatedly threatened to contaminate U.S. drinking water supplies.
- **Critical Infrastructure:** Water is a critical part of national infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure Challenges:** The American Society of Civil Engineers rates the nation’s drinking water infrastructure as D- and estimates that an investment of $255 billion is needed to meet necessary standards.

## 3. Water Meters as Revenue Generators
- **Billing Mechanism:** Water bills are calculated based on the difference between the current and previous meter readings, known as "usage."
- **Revenue Calculation:** Usage multiplied by water rates equals the usage charge.
- **Annual Income:** U.S. water utilities generate approximately $40 billion annually from meter information.
- **Cost Variations:** Average monthly water bills range from $34.29 in Phoenix to $65.47 in Boston for a family of four using 100 gallons per person daily.
- **Operational Support:** This revenue is crucial for day-to-day operations and capital replacement, which is currently billions behind schedule.

## 4. Potential Issues with Water Meters
- **Brockton, Mass. Audit (June 2011):**
  - Most meters were over 15 years old.
  - From FY2006 to FY2010, about 25% of water bills were estimated rather than based on actual readings.
  - Billing staff lacked sufficient training in using the system.
  - Resulted in retroactive bills, including one instance where a homeowner received a $97,000 bill.

## 5. Meter Tampering and Theft
- **Financial Impact:** Energy theft costs U.S. consumers billions of dollars annually.
- **Electric Utilities:** Assume a 10% loss each year due to theft.
- **Water Theft:** Tampering with or bypassing water meters results in significant financial losses for utilities, such as the Boston Water and Sewer Commission (BWSC).

## 6. Water Meter Engineering
- **Meter Types:**
  - **Displacement Meters:**
    - Oscillating Piston
    - Nutating Disk
  - **Velocity Meters:**
    - Single Jet (Paddle Wheel)
    - Multi-jet (Horizontal Impeller)
    - Turbine
    - Propeller
  - **Ultrasonic Meters:** Measure the transit time of ultrasonic pulses in and against flow direction.
  - **Electromagnetic Flow Meters:** Operate based on Faraday's Law of induction, which states that a voltage will be induced in a conductor moving through a magnetic field (Faraday's Law: E = kBDV).

- **Common Types:**
  - Multi-jet Meter
  - Single-jet Meter
  - Positive Displacement Meter
  - Turbine Meter
  - Compound Meter
  - Fire Meter
  - Fire Hydrant Meter
  - Electromagnetic (Mag) Meter
  - Ultrasonic Meter

## 7. Data Collection: Register
- **Data Collection Devices:** Meters collect data, which is displayed on the "register."
- **Data Representation:** The register shows the total volume of water that has passed through the meter since installation.
- **Interval Readings:** Frequent readings provide more detailed information.

## 8. Data Collection Methods
- **Manual Reading (Eyeball):** A meter reader physically enters the premises to read the meter.
- **Walk-By:** A device connected to the meter allows reading without entering the building.
- **Drive-By:** Meters equipped with radio frequency transmitters are read by a meter reader driving past.
- **Fixed Network (Smart Meters):** Enables almost continuous readings (every 5-15 minutes) through a central receiving station or repeaters. Common topologies include star and mesh networks.

## 9. Basic Network Components
- **Wireless Transmitter/Transceiver:** On the meter.
- **Collector/Receiver/Transceiver:** For drive-by or static locations.
- **Central Collector Receiver/Transceiver:** Central receiving station.
- **Billing Office Computer System:** Manages and processes the collected data.

## 10. Role of Wireless Water Meters
- **Embedded Device:** Node in a sensor network.
- **Information Collection:** Acts as an electronic cash register.
- **Regulator:** Controls the availability of drinking water.
- **Conservation Tool:** Promotes water conservation.
- **Surveillance Concerns:** Raises privacy and surveillance issues.

## 11. Types of Wireless Water Meters
- **Lack of Standards:** No universal standards.

## 12. Growth of Smart Water Meters
- **U.S. Market:** The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) market (electricity, gas, water) is expected to grow from $2.54 billion in 2010 to $5.82 billion in 2015, at an 18% compound annual growth rate.
- **Global Market:** The world smart water meter market is projected to reach $4.2 billion between 2010 and 2016.
