where the rows are linearly independent, and the number of
rows equals k1 + k2 − 1. This transformation preserves the
rank of R because R can be reconstructed from R′ as fol-
lows: the ﬁrst k2 rows in R and R′ are identical; row(qk2+1)
in R equals row(k2 +q) in R′ (q = 1, . . . , k1 −1); row(qk2 +i)
4If certain links in G cannot be included in any possible
paths constructed from m1 to m2 in Fig. 2, then these links
are unidentiﬁable, resulting in a disconnected or one-edge-
connected interior graph H.
in R equals row(i) + row(k2 + q) − row(1) in R′ (q = 1, . . . ,
k1 −1, i = 2, . . . , k2). Hence, the rank of R equals k1 +k2 −1.
When H is not connected, some rows in R may not exist be-
cause there is no simple path connecting the corresponding
nodes in A and B, and the rank of R may be even smaller.
Since there are k1 + k2 unknown variables (Wm1ai )k1
i=1 and
(Wbj m2 )k2
j=1, they cannot be uniquely determined even if all
link metrics in H are already known. Therefore, G with
||G|| ≥ 2 is unidentiﬁable by using two monitors. (cid:3)
In fact, we can show that none of the exterior links is iden-
tiﬁable because metric of any one exterior link will uniquely
determine metrics of the rest; see proof in [26].
Corollary 4.1. None of the exterior links (except m1m2)
can be identiﬁed with two monitors.
4.2 Discussions on Paths with Cycles
At the end of Section III-B in [19], the authors raise the
question whether or not monitoring non-simple paths (i.e.,
paths that may contain cycles) between two monitors suf-
ﬁces to identify all link metrics in the network5. According
to Corollary 4.1, the exterior links cannot be identiﬁed even
if all the interior link metrics are known; allowing cycles in
the interior graph H provides no additional information re-
garding the exterior links. Consequently, the answer to that
question in [19] is that monitoring (simple or non-simple)
paths between two monitors is not suﬃcient to identify all
link metrics.
5.
IDENTIFIABILITY OF INTERIOR LINKS
WITH TWO MONITORS
Network administrators are more interested in using end-
to-end measurements to infer the qualities of links that are
at least one-hop away. Therefore, in this section, we only
focus on the interior graph H and derive necessary and suf-
ﬁcient conditions on the network topology G for identifying
all links in H using two monitors (m1 and m2), under the
earlier assumption that no link metrics (including those of
links incident to m1 and m2) are known ahead of time.
Before going into details, we ﬁrst point out that it is suf-
ﬁcient to solve the case in which H is a connected graph.
This is because if H consists of KH (KH ≥ 2) connected
components Hi (i = 1, . . . , KH ), we can decompose the en-
tire graph G into sub-graphs Gi
:= Hi + m1 + m2, with
G = ∪KH
i=1 Gi (see the deﬁnition of graph union in Table 1).
Since none of the m1 → m2 simple paths in Gi can traverse
Gj (i 6= j), the identiﬁcation of links within diﬀerent Gi’s is
mutually independent. Therefore, in the rest of this section,
we assume H to be connected with ||H|| ≥ 1. Our result can
be applied to each Gi separately when H is disconnected.
5.1 Proof of Theorem 3.2: Necessary Part
Suppose all links in H are identiﬁable. We prove the ne-
cessity of Conditions 1(cid:13)– 2(cid:13) in Theorem 3.2 by contradiction.
a) Let l1 ∈ L(H) be an arbitrary interior link. If G − l1 is
disconnected, then l1 is a bridge6 in G (shown in Fig. 4(a)).
If G1 and G2 each contains a monitor, then l1 is unidentiﬁable
by Lemma A.1 (Appendix). If m1 and m2 are both in G1
5We restrict the paths from containing repeated monitors to
exclude measurement of cycles, as is already solved in [19].
6A link whose removal will disconnect the graph is a bridge
[25].

(or G2), then l1 cannot be included in any measurement
path (otherwise, l1 will be used more than once), and is
thus unidentiﬁable. Both cases contradict the assumption
that all interior links are identiﬁable.
b) Suppose there is a bridge l2 in G −l1. If l2 is an exterior
link, as shown in Fig. 4(b), then by Lemma A.1 (Appendix),
its adjacent interior links rai ∈ L(H) are unidentiﬁable, con-
tradicting the assumption that all interior links are identi-
ﬁable. Thus, l2 must be an interior link. Since by a), an
interior link cannot be a bridge in G, {l1, l2} must be an
edge cut as shown in Fig. 4(c) and 4(d). If both m1 and m2
are in G1 as in Fig. 4(c), then all m1 → m2 paths traversing
l1 must traverse l2 as well. Thus we can at most identify
Wl1 + Wl2 , but not Wl1 and Wl2 individually. If m1 is in
G1 and m2 is in G2 as in Fig. 4(d), then all m1 → m2 paths
must traverse either l1 or l2, but not both. Assuming that
G1 and G2 in Fig. 4(d) are connected and all link metrics
in them are known, then the resulting measurement matrix
R1 is similar to (3), except that each row in R1 has a new
entry associated with Wl1 or Wl2 :

Here blank entries correspond to zeroes, R is given by (3),
and e1 is a (k1 × k2)-element column vector of all ones. Let
R2 and R3 denote the ﬁrst and last k1 × k2 rows in R1,
respectively. Then applying the same linear transformations
as applied to (3) to both R2 and R3, we can transform R1
into R′

G1 and G2 are not connected, the rank of R′′
1 can be even
smaller. Thus, Wl1 and Wl2 are unidentiﬁable, contradicting
the assumption that all the interior links are identiﬁable.

Figure 5: Two types of identiﬁable links in H.
Based on a) and b), we see that G − l1 must be 2-edge-
connected for any l1 ∈ L(H) (i.e., Condition 1(cid:13) holds).
c) We can also prove Condition 2(cid:13) by contradiction; see
Proposition A.2 (Appendix). (cid:3)
5.2 Proof of Theorem 3.2: Sufﬁcient Part
Given Conditions 1(cid:13)– 2(cid:13), we need to show that all links
in H are identiﬁable. We ﬁrst introduce two types of iden-
tiﬁable links. The argument then consists of showing that
every interior link belongs to one of these two types.
5.2.1 Cross-link, Shortcut, and Non-separating
Cycle
We begin by introducing a few notions essential to our
proof.
The ﬁrst notion is a cross-link that connects nodes on two
simple paths between the monitors.
Definition 2. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), link y is a
cross-link if ∃ four m1 → m2 paths PA, PB, PC , and PD
formed from simple paths P1, . . . , P4 by:
( PA = P1 ∪ P2
PB = P3 ∪ P4
, ( PC = P1 ∪ y ∪ P4
PD = P3 ∪ y ∪ P2
,
(5)
5.2.2 The Proof
such that
( |P1 ∩ P2| = 1
|P3 ∩ P4| = 1
,( |P2 ∩ P3| = 0
|P1 ∩ P4| = 0
.
(6)
See Table 1 for deﬁnitions of graph union/intersection and
| · |; note that paths are also graphs. The constraints in
(6) are used to ensure that PA–PD are simple paths, e.g.,
|P1 ∩ P2| = 1 (P1 and P2 have no common node other than
v1) ensures that no cycles exist in PA. However, this does
not require P1–P4 to be node disjoint, e.g., P1 and P3 can
have common nodes. A cross-link y can then be identiﬁed by
Wy =
1
2
(WPC + WPD − WPA − WPB ).
(7)
The second notion is a shortcut that connects the end-
points of a simple path whose metric is known.
Definition 3. As illustrated in Fig. 5(b), link y is a short-
cut if ∃ a simple path P3 whose metric has been identiﬁed
such that the following m1 → m2 simple paths can be formed:
v1
v2
m2

Figure 7: Possible cases of interior link vw: (a) Case
A, (b) Case B-1, (c) Case B-2.
Definition 4. A non-separating cycle in G, denoted by
F , is an induced sub-graph7 such that: (i) F is a cycle (see
deﬁnition in Table 1), and (ii) F does not separate any node
from monitors, i.e., each connected component in G \ F con-
tains at least one monitor.
For example, there are four non-separating cycles in Fig. 6:
v1v2v3v1, v4v3v2v5v4, m1v1v3v4m1, and v5v2m2v5. Cycle
v4v3v1v2v5v4 is not a non-separating cycle as it is not in-
duced (due to link v2v3), neither is v4m1v1v2v5v4 as it sep-
arates v3 from monitors.
The key to the suﬃciency proof is to show that each inte-
rior link can be categorized as either a cross-link or a short-
cut when the network satisﬁes Conditions 1(cid:13) and 2(cid:13). The
proof proceeds in three steps.
The ﬁrst step is to show that under Conditions 1(cid:13) and
2(cid:13), every interior link vw satisﬁes one of the three cases as
shown in Fig. 7. Speciﬁcally, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1. If graph G satisﬁes Conditions 1(cid:13) and 2(cid:13),
then for any interior link vw, there exists a non-separating
cycle F with vw ∈ L(F ), a cycle C with vw ∈ L(C), a simple
path P1 connecting one monitor with a node on F − v − w,
and a simple path P2 connecting the other monitor with a
node on C − v − w such that
(a) F and C have at most one common node other than v, w
(i.e., |V (F ) ∩ V (C)| ≤ 3);
(b) P1 and P2 are disjoint, neither going through v nor w
(i.e., P1 ∩ P2 = ∅, v, w /∈ V (P1) and v, w /∈ V (P2));
(c) |V (P1) ∩ V (F )| = 1, |V (P2) ∩ V (C)| = 1.
PA = P1 ∪ y ∪ P2, PB = P1 ∪ P3 ∪ P2,
(8)
Proof. See [26].
satisfying |P1 ∩ P3| = 1, |P2 ∩ P3| = 1, and |P1 ∩ P2| = 0.
Again, the constraints are used to guarantee that PA and
PB are simple paths. A shortcut y can be identiﬁed by
Wy = WPA − WPB + WP3 .
(9)
The third notion is a special kind of cycle deﬁned as fol-
lows.
Lemma 5.1 states that there must exist two cycles sharing
link vw, a non-separating cycle F and a (not necessarily
non-separating) cycle C that satisfy conditions (a)–(c) in the
lemma. These conditions imply three possible cases:
7An induced sub-graph G′ of G is a sub-graph such that for
any pair of vertices v and w in G′, vw is an edge in G′ if and
only if vw is an edge in G.
• Case A (Fig. 7(a)): C is also a non-separating cycle, F
and C have no common node other than v and w, and
F /C each connects to a diﬀerent monitor by a disjoint
simple path;
• Case B-1 (Fig. 7(b)): any path from any node in F −
v − w to monitors must have a common node with
C − v − w;
• Case B-2 (Fig. 7(c)): F and C must have at least one
common node (denoted by r) other than v and w.
These cases are guaranteed to be complete by Lemma 5.1.
We will show later that Case A links are cross-links and Case
B (including B-1 and B-2) links are shortcuts.
The second step is to recognize that in Case A (Fig. 7(a)),
we can construct four measurement paths PA–PD by (5), us-
ing P1–P4 marked in the ﬁgure. Thus, a Case A link vw is a
cross-link and thus can be identiﬁed as in (7). The challenge
is that it is impossible to construct measurement paths as
in (5) for the other two cases (Fig. 7(b) and 7(c)), since the
conditions in (6) cannot be satisﬁed. This motivates us to
