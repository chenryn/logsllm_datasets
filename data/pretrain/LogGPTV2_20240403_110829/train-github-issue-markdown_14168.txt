I think next.js grown up into level when examples could live by own life in
separate repository (eg. zeit/next.js-examples). Examples are more about wide
community than core development and doesn't require so much quality as core
do.  
Many pull request are about updating examples or about adding new examples.  
Separation could improve dynamism of both projects.
