I believe Next.js has matured to a point where its examples could thrive in a separate repository (e.g., `zeit/next.js-examples`). Examples are more relevant to the broader community than to core development and do not require the same level of quality control as the core project. 

Currently, many pull requests focus on updating or adding new examples. By separating the examples into their own repository, we could enhance the dynamism and agility of both the core project and the examples.
