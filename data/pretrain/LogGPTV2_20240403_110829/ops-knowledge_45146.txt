User: I am using the Python logging library and want to choose the folder where the log files will be written.
For the moment, I made an instance of TimedRotatingFileHandler with the entry parameter filename="myLogFile.log" . This way myLogFile.log is created on the same folder than my python script. I want to create it into another folder.
How could I create myLogFile.log into , let's say, the Desktop folder?
Thanks,
Matias
Assistant: Simple give a different filename like filename=r"C:\User\Matias\Desktop\myLogFile.log
