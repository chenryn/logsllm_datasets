This is _not_ a feature request (for rest/spread operator) or a bug report
(that rest/spread doesn't work).
  1. Is there a way to configure vscode today to suppress or otherwise not show as syntax errors the usage of the object spread operator?
  2. If this is not possible, should we update the public documentation about ES6 support (which today links to a summary of ES6 features **including** rest/spread) to indicate this lack of support?
