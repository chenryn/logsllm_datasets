### Comparison of Passwords and FIDO2 1FA with Security Key

#### Introduction
FIDO2 offers two-factor, multi-factor, and single-factor (passwordless) authentication. It can be implemented as a pure USB token or with additional NFC support. This solution does not require dedicated hardware (e.g., a reader) or software; it works with preinstalled drivers on commonly available media (i.e., USB, NFC). For authentication, users must demonstrate physical presence by pressing a capacitive button on the key, which is indicated by a flashing light. No further user input is required. In our study, we use the USB-only version of the Yubico Security Key for passwordless authentication (see Section V).

#### Framework for Comparison
To provide context for FIDO2, we apply the framework developed by Bonneau et al. [1] in an expert assessment to compare the FIDO2 standard with text-based password authentication. Lang et al. [25] also compared U2F Security Keys with text-based passwords using this framework, and Das et al. [26] concurred with their assessment. However, our comparison extends to FIDO2 and includes the type of authenticator device as an additional dimension.

#### Bonneauâ€™s Framework
Bonneau et al.'s framework consists of 25 subjective factors that evaluate various aspects of authentication methods. These factors help in assessing the benefits and drawbacks of different authentication techniques.

#### Evaluation of FIDO2 and Passwords
- **Password**: Offers basic security but is vulnerable to many types of attacks, such as phishing and brute force.
- **FIDO2 1FA (Security Key)**: 
  - **Benefits**:
    - Provides strong two-factor, multi-factor, and single-factor (passwordless) authentication.
    - Does not require dedicated hardware or software, making it more accessible.
    - Requires physical presence, enhancing security.
  - **Dependence on FIDO2 Standard**:
    - The FIDO2 standard is fixed and applies to all authenticators, ensuring a consistent level of security.
  - **Authenticator Device**:
    - The type of authenticator (e.g., USB-only or with NFC) can influence the user experience and security.
  - **User Experience**:
    - Users need only press a capacitive button, which is simple and intuitive.
    - No additional user input is required, streamlining the process.

#### Conclusion
FIDO2 1FA with a Security Key provides a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based authentication. By extending the comparison to include the type of authenticator device, we can better understand the nuances and benefits of FIDO2 in different contexts.

For a detailed breakdown of the 25 subjective factors, refer to the following table:

| Factor | Password | FIDO2 1FA (Security Key) |
|--------|----------|--------------------------|
| 1FA    | Offers benefit | Offers benefit |
| 2FA    | Does not offer benefit | Offers benefit |
| MFA    | Does not offer benefit | Offers benefit |
| Passwordless | Does not offer benefit | Offers benefit |
| Hardware Dependency | High | Low |
| Software Dependency | High | Low |
| Physical Presence | Not required | Required |
| User Input | Required | Minimal |
| Security | Vulnerable to many attacks | Stronger and more secure |

This table provides a clear and concise comparison, highlighting the advantages of FIDO2 1FA with a Security Key over traditional password-based authentication.
