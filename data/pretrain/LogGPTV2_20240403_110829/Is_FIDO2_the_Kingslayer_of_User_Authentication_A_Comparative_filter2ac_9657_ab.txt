Password
1FA
= offers beneﬁt;
= does not offer beneﬁt
= depends only on FIDO2 standard and is ﬁxed for all authenticators;
= almost offers beneﬁt;
otherwise, depends purely or mostly on the authenticator device
fers two-factor, multi-factor, and single-factor (passwordless)
authentication. It ships either as a pure USB token or with
additional NFC support. It requires neither dedicated hardware
(e.g., a reader) nor software, but works with preinstalled
drivers on commonly available media (i.e., USB, NFC). To
authenticate, users are required to show physical presence
during command execution by pressing a capacitive button
on the key (i.e., support for test-of-user-presence), indicated
by the button ﬂashing. There is no need for any further
user input. In our study, we use the USB-only version of
the Yubico Security Key as an authenticator in passwordless
authentication (see Section V).
Comparison of passwords and FIDO2 1FA with Security Key
We provide context for FIDO2 by applying the framework
of Bonneau et al. [1] in an expert assessment to compare the
FIDO2 standard to text-based password authentication. Lang et
al. [25] also provide a comparison of U2F Security Keys with
text-based passwords using this framework and Das et al. [26]
concurred with their assessment; however, as we explain in
the following, we extend this comparison to FIDO2 and also
consider the type of authenticator device as an additional
dimension in our assessment.
Bonneau’s et al. framework contains 25 subjective factors
