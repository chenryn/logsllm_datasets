I encountered an issue while running the following code:

```python
corpus = [
    'This is the first document.',
    'This is the second second document.',
    'And the third one.',
    'Is this the first document?'
]

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=1)
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus).todense()
```

The code produces the following error:
```
ValueError: Buffer dtype mismatch, expected 'int' but got 'long'
```

### Environment Details:
- scikit-learn version: 0.15-git
- SciPy version: 0.14.0.dev-7cefb25
- Platform: Mac OSX 10.9.2

Could you please help me resolve this issue?
