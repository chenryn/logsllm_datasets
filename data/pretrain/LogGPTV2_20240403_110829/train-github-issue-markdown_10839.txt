I was trying this code:
> > > corpus = ['This is the first document.',  
>  ... 'This is the second second document.',  
>  ... 'And the third one.',  
>  ... 'Is this the first document?']  
>  from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer  
>  vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=1)  
>  vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus).todense()
Gives  
ValueError: Buffer dtype mismatch, expected 'int' but got 'long'
