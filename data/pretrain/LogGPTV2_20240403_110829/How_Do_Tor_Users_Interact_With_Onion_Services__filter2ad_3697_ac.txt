### DNS Leaks of Onion Domains and Their Implications

Onion domains, which are only resolvable within the Tor network, can be mistakenly accessed by users using non-Tor browsers. This results in DNS queries for these onion domains "leaking" to conventional DNS resolvers, and ultimately to DNS root servers. Since conventional DNS servers cannot resolve onion domains, all such queries will result in cache misses and eventually reach a DNS root server. Consequently, DNS root servers receive a representative sample of leaked onion domain queries. Our study builds on previous research that analyzed similar data sets but did not specifically focus on onion services [18, 33].

We obtained several days of DNS data from the B root server through the IMPACT Cyber Trust program [34]. The dataset consists of hundreds of pcap files containing full packet captures with pseudonymized IP addresses of all DNS traffic to the B root from September 19, 2017, 10:00 UTC to September 21, 2017, 23:59 UTC. We analyzed this DNS query dataset and present our findings alongside the results from our survey and interviews.

From the DNS queries, we extracted the QNAME, yielding 15,471 correctly formatted onion domains, each 16 characters long (representing an 80-bit hash of the ownerâ€™s public key) and consisting of letters and numbers between 2 and 7. These queries may not always correspond to real onion sites but indicate that some machine issued a DNS query for that onion domain for some reason.

### Biases in Survey and Interview Data

As previously mentioned, we asked The Tor Project to disseminate our survey via their blog and Twitter account, which likely introduced several biases:

- **Non-response Bias:** Individuals who noticed our call for volunteers but chose not to participate may have valued their privacy, believed their perspective was irrelevant, lacked time, or had other reasons. Non-respondents may have fundamentally different traits compared to those who participated.
  
- **Survivor Bias:** Our participants generally tolerated the usability issues of the Tor Browser, which is why they were still using it. We likely did not hear from those who found the browser unsuitable, and thus could not understand what drove them away. This bias can lead to optimizing the user experience for a subset of users with higher tolerance for inconvenience.

- **Self-selection Bias:** Due to the nature of our online survey, participants self-selected into the respondent group. These respondents may be more engaged, technical, and opinionated. The demographic for our online survey was young and educated, but we cannot generalize this to the entire Tor Browser population.

### Results

#### Perception and Use of Onion Services

We first explore how users perceive onion site technology and why they use onion sites.

##### Incomplete Mental Models of Onion Services

We asked interviewees about their mental models of onion services, as collecting such information from a survey is challenging. Here are the key findings:

- **Understanding of Onion Services:** About half of the interviewees (9/17) knew that onion services enable anonymous access to web content. Six interviewees stated that onion services provide extra layers of protection, as illustrated in Figure 3. Four interviewees thought onion services work similarly to Tor but with different encryption methods, as shown in Figure 4. A minority of participants had a sophisticated understanding, referring to the encryption of data at the endpoints and the last hop along the encrypted path corresponding to an onion link.

- **Perception of Anonymity:** Five interviewees drew a connection between Tor and onion services, stating that onion services must be accessed through the Tor browser. Only three interviewees understood that onion services provide anonymity to both visitors and website providers. Nearly half of the interviewees (8/17) were confused about defining, functioning, or describing onion services, and did not fully understand the protections they offer.

- **Misconceptions and Confusion:** Some interviewees conflated disguising IP addresses with disguising real-world identities, using the term "anonymity" broadly. This conflation leads to an incomplete understanding of the security and privacy guarantees provided by the Tor network. For example, one interviewee questioned the point of using Facebook via onion services when the business model still involves data collection.

- **End-to-End Security and Self-Certifying Names:** Few participants were aware that onion services provide end-to-end security and self-certifying names. Syverson and Boyce explored the benefits of onion services for website authentication [32], but these benefits are difficult to convey to non-technical users.

- **DNS Root Data Corroboration:** The presence of many onion domains in the root DNS data supports prior studies suggesting that internet users are either attempting to visit onion domains in non-Tor browsers, browsers are pre-fetching content with onion links, or web pages and malware are trying to load resources from onion sites [18, 33].

##### Uses of Onion Services

- **Anonymity and Security:** The main reason for using onion services among interviewees (6/17) was anonymity. Two interviewees felt a sense of security and safety, while two others viewed onion services as a "harm reduction technique." One interviewee preferred Facebook's onion domain to impede tracking efforts. Additionally, 47% of survey respondents and three interviewees saw onion services as the only way to access certain content, making their use necessary.

- **Non-browsing Activities:** Of the survey respondents who used onion services (485/517), 64% used them for purposes other than web browsing. Protocols like Ricochet [4] and OnionShare [15] are built on top of onion services, and existing TCP-based tools like SSH can use onion addresses. Less than a quarter (21%) of survey participants used onion services for non-browsing activities, such as remote login or chat, at least once a month.

- **Work and Personal Reasons:** Many survey respondents (45%) selected "Other" for onion service usage, citing personal and work-related reasons. Some used onion services to give machines behind NAT devices a stable identifier, while others used them for specific tasks, such as teaching students about the dark web or accessing Pirate Bay, Ricochet, TorChat, and OnionShare.

- **Exploring the Dark Web:** 27% of survey respondents and two interviewees wanted to learn more about the dark web and onion domain content. Some used onion services for fun and social reasons, such as "toying around" and spending time with friends.

- **Setting Up Onion Services:** 39% of survey respondents had set up an onion service, with 31% running them for private use and 21% for public use. Reasons for setting up onion services included end-to-end security, curiosity, NAT traversal, and testing. Only 18% set up onion services for anonymity, and some used them for business, work, or adding valuable content to the onion community.

- **Phishing Concerns:** We inquired about concerns regarding potential attacks on onion services. Less than 8% of survey respondents were concerned about phishing, denial-of-service, and deanonymization attacks. Only 15% were extremely concerned about deanonymization, 10% about service downtime, and 9% about phishing.

- **Trust in Tor and Onion Services:** Our survey showed that onion services were perceived as less safe than the Tor browser. 85% of respondents felt at least somewhat safe using the Tor browser, compared to only 66% for onion services.

### Conclusion

Our study highlights the varying perceptions and uses of onion services, as well as the challenges in ensuring their proper understanding and use. Addressing these gaps in knowledge and improving the user experience for a broader audience is crucial for the continued adoption and effectiveness of onion services.
