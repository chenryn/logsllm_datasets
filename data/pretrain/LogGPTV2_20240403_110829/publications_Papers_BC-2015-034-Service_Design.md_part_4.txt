### Touchpoints and the Journey

The sequential touchpoints support the impression of a journey. Additional text on aspects such as obstacles to continuation or motivation to proceed can complement the map (Figure 4.8).

### Evaluating the Journey

By building a persona, the service designer gains deep insights into the user's personality and needs. Creating a journey map from the perspective of this persona, as shown in Figure 4.8, reveals the persona’s emotions and overall experience based on their needs. Analyzing these emotions and the additional information provided by the journey map allows for a better understanding and prioritization of the persona’s needs and motivations. For this, a framework like Kano’s model of customer satisfaction (Figure 4.9) is particularly useful [31,32,33].

Needs are relatively stable, while requirements—how and to what extent a need should be satisfied—may vary. Kano et al. suggest that there are three types of requirements:

1. **Type 1 Requirements**: These are explicitly expressed by customers. For the tourist in the opening case, this would be “a hotel room for x nights including breakfast.”
2. **Type 2 Requirements**: These are typically not expressed explicitly but are considered obvious. For the traveler, this would include a clean and quiet room. Fulfilling these requirements does not excite the customer, but failing to meet them can dramatically reduce satisfaction.
3. **Type 3 Requirements**: These are unexpected and provide an opportunity to delight the customer. In hotels, complementary upgrades, free pralines in the room, or an invitation to a get-together belong to this category.

Notably, no matter how well a provider serves type 3 requirements, if they miss out on type 1 or, particularly, type 2, the overall experience will suffer significantly. In literature, these types have received various names: one-dimensional or key (type 1), must-be or hygiene (type 2), and delighters, motivators, or attractive (type 3). This chapter uses the neutral terms type 1, type 2, and type 3.

### Example of a Customer Journey Map

**Itinerary Trip**

- **Booking Hotel Stay**
  - **Planning Review**
    - Finding recommendations
    - Calling the hotel to ensure a nice room
  - **Hotel Stay**
    - Friendly welcome at the hotel
    - Got a nice room
  - **Customer Evaluation**
    - Realized loud noise “outside”
    - Complained, got a different room
    - Breakfast was okay
    - Bitter memories, tells everybody

**Motivation and Questions**

- **Excited about holidays on Iceland!**
  - Best places to go?
  - Do the hotels fit our needs?
- **Helpful staff!**
  - No questions, I am happy
- **Why can’t they offer us another room?**
  - Why can’t they fix the trouble?
- **Just grab breakfast and head to the airport**
  - Why don’t they even excuse during check-out?

### Evaluating the Customer Journey Map

When evaluating the customer journey map, service designers reflect on the overall shape of the journey, the number of touchpoints positioned in the negative emotions zone, and the types of requirements that were violated, making the persona perceive a given touchpoint negatively. Additionally, designers consider what it would take to change the shape of the curve, moving the experience at specific touchpoints from a neutral to a positive level. Each touchpoint and the journey’s shape provide opportunities for innovation [12].

Remarkably, the customer journey approach can be applied to a given situation as well as hypothetically to an idea for a new or changed service. In the latter case, it can facilitate a comparison of the original state of the service with the expected impact of a design change.

### Service Blueprinting

Service blueprinting is a method to identify and describe the processes that support services. While the Karni and Kaner approach presented in Chapter 1 looked at a service as a system composed of many components (e.g., inputs, outputs, environment, and resources), blueprinting focuses mainly on service processes and their activities.

**Definition — Service Blueprinting:** A technique to help organizations understand their service offerings and delivery processes by enabling the examination of service processes from a customer's point of view.

The output of service blueprinting is a graphical representation of a service process, as shown in Figure 4.10. This example corresponds to the service blueprint of a typical hotel stay. It identifies process activities, the interaction points between the customer and the service provider, and the roles of customers and employees. In more detail, the process describes the management of the lifecycle of an overnight stay, which includes activities such as check-in, registration, food delivery, and check-out.

**R Service Blueprinting** was introduced by Shostack in 1984 ([34]) and has its origins in service quality, customer experience, and customer satisfaction research.

### Benefits of Service Blueprinting

The benefits of service blueprinting are wide-ranging. Organizations can make explicit how services are provisioned to customers. Benefits range from fostering innovation, quality management, training support, efficiency improvements, and service standardization:

- **Innovation:** Service blueprinting is a planning and analysis tool that can be used to develop new innovative services and improve existing ones. The processes and activities identified can provide the grounds to discover areas for innovation and suggest ways to customize services to address niche markets with specific needs.
- **Quality:** The graphical representation of processes enables quick identification of possible failure points. This provides managers with the facts and the possibility to redesign procedures leading to increased customer satisfaction. Over time, it becomes possible to develop operating procedures with proven high quality.
- **Training:** Detailed descriptions of service designs provide important documentation that can be used during the training of new employees. Staff can grasp and understand who executes which activities and when.
- **Efficiency:** The visual representation of processes provides the opportunity to parallelize the execution of activities to reduce the time to complete services. It also enables highlighting which activities are fundamental, optional, and which should be adapted to better satisfy customer requirements.
- **Standardization:** The codification of the knowledge associated with the operation of services enables the identification of best practices, leading to the creation of organizational standards. Once identified, golden service blueprints can be distributed and implemented at several locations, ensuring consistent service quality.

In practice, service blueprinting is used by process managers and service designers to conceive how a service will work. Service managers and employees can use service blueprints as a guide to operate services on a daily basis. While service blueprinting has many benefits, one disadvantage is that it typically looks at processes from a managerial and process orientation rather than a customer perspective.

### Structure and Components of a Service Blueprint

A blueprint consists of a structure and several components, as illustrated in Figure 4.11. The structure can be viewed as a two-dimensional structure: the vertical axis provides several swimlanes that identify various areas of action, and the horizontal axis identifies the timeline of activities conducted by the customer and service provider.

A blueprint has five main vertical components: four swimlanes separated by lines, and a special area capturing any physical evidence of the occurrence of customer actions:

- **Physical Evidence:** These are identifiable and visible outcomes that result from executing activities. They are a way to recognize that a service exists and attest to the progress of a service delivery process. For example, the registration desk, a central point of contact between service providers and customers where requests can be made, is a physical evidence of the service.
- **Customer Actions:** These are the steps that customers are required to take as part of the process of service delivery. They are drawn sequentially from left to right and are located above the line of interaction, which separates the interactions between customers and providers. For instance, to request a specific service, customers know that they must make a phone call, send an email, or go to the service/registration desk.
- **Onstage Contact:** These are activities taken by employees that are visible to customers as part of the service process. Therefore, they are located above the line of visibility. Every time the customer and provider interact, the line of interaction is crossed, and a moment of truth occurs. For example, when a clerk receives a request from a customer, the first step is to register the request with the management systems. Then, the request is categorized and prioritized for better utilization of resources and support staff time.
- **Backstage Contact:** These are activities taken by employees that are not visible to customers. They happen behind the scenes to support onstage activities. The line of internal interaction separates the onstage contact employee activities from support processes and activities. For example, the staff that takes a food order by phone may not be visible to customers. In such a case, they are classified under the label backstage contact.
- **Support Processes:** These are activities carried out that are not directly related to a particular customer but need to exist for a service to be delivered. Thus, they are located below the line of internal interaction. For instance, the activity registration calls for a support process managed by an information system, which will determine if the record of a customer already exists, what their preferences concerning the view of the room are, and what rooms are available.

While the four lanes that decompose a service delivery process are kept physically separate, they are connected by channels of communication.

### How to Develop a Blueprint

The process of building a service blueprint can be decomposed into six distinct steps [35]:

1. **Identify the Service to be Blueprinted:** Services may need to be prioritized to select the most important services to model or to start by modeling the simplest ones to gain experience with the technique.
2. **Identify the Customer or Customer Segment Target for the Service:** There is often no "one-size-fits-all" solution when developing services that bring a high level of satisfaction to customers. When too many distinct customers are considered, it becomes difficult to take design decisions.
3. **Map the Service Process from the Customer’s Point of View:** Once services and customers are identified, the actual service blueprinting starts. Two activities are executed: map the customer’s process and map the service providers’ own processes.
4. **Map Contact Employee and/or Technology Activities:** Reconstructing or finding how providers’ processes operate is not always an easy task, especially when complex information systems, such as enterprise resource management systems, are involved.
5. **Link Contact Activities to the Required Support Functions:** This step links contact activities to support activities.
6. **Add Physical Evidence of Service Delivery at Each Customer Action:** Finally, the physical evidence and tangible aspects of a service are added to customers’ contact activities. In this step, as well as in step two, blueprinting requires designers to consider the manner in which customers experience service delivery since designers are most likely not part of the customer segment under study. In other words, designers should replace their perceptions of the service delivery with what is important for customers.

### Other Modeling Approaches

Modeling is a common activity in organizational settings. Business models, process models, and other forms of diagrams are used to represent and analyze various aspects of an organization.
