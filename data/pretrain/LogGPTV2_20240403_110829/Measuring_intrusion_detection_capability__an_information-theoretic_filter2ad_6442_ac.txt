Compared to Figure 3, N M I is far less sensitive than CID. Note the orders of magnitude diﬀerence in scales

with the top ROC curve is better. However, if the curves do
cross, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) can be used for
comparison. However, this may not be a “fair” comparison
because AUC measures all possible operation points of an
IDS, while in practice, an IDS is ﬁne-tuned to a particular
(optimal) conﬁguration (e.g., using a particular threshold).
Gaﬀney and Ulvila [6] proposed to combine cost-based
analysis with ROC to compute an expected cost for each
IDS operation point. The expected cost can then be used
to select the best operation point and to compare diﬀerent
IDSs. They assigned cost Cα for responding to a false alarm
and cost Cβ for every missed attack. They deﬁned the cost
ratio as C = Cβ/Cα. Using a decision tree model, the ex-
pected cost of operating at a given point on the ROC curve
is the sum of the products of the probabilities of the IDS
alerts and the expected costs conditional on the alerts. This
expected cost is given by the following equation:
Cexp = M in{CβB, (1−α)(1−B)}+M in{C(1−β)B, α(1−B)}
(3)
In a realistic IDS operation environment, the base rate
is very low, say 10−5. The α is also very low, say 10−3
(because most IDSs are tuned to have very low α), while
β may not be as low, say 10−1. Hence, we can reasonably
assume B  1
(5)
From the above analysis, we can see that C is a very im-
portant factor in determining the expected cost. However,
C is not an objective measure. In fact, in practice, the ap-
propriate value of C is very hard to determine. Furthermore,
in [6], Gaﬀney and Ulvila assumed a stationary cost ratio
(C), which may not be appropriate because in practical sit-
uations, the relative cost (or tradeoﬀ) of a false alarm and
a missed attack changes as the total number of false alarms
and missed attacks changes.
To conclude, using ROC alone has limitations. Combin-
ing it with cost analysis can be useful, but it involves a
subjective parameter that is very hard to estimate because
a good (risk) analysis model is hard to obtain in many cases.
On the other hand, our CID is a very natural and objective
metric. Therefore, it provides a very good complement to
the cost-based approach.
3.2 Bayesian Detection Rate
Bayesian detection rate [1] is, in fact, the positive predic-
tive value (P P V ), which is the probability of an intrusion
when the IDS outputs an alarm. Similarly, Bayesian nega-
tive rate (or negative predictive value, N P V ) is the prob-
ability of no intrusion when the IDS does not output an
alarm. These metrics are very important from a usability
point of view because ultimately, the IDS alarms are useful
only if the IDS has high P P V and N P V . Both P P V and
N P V depend on T P and F P , and are sensitive to base rate.
They can be expressed using Bayes theorem so that the base
rate can be entered as a piece of prior information about the
IDS operational environment in the Bayesian equations.
The Bayesian detection rate (P P V ) is deﬁned as [1]:
P (I|A) =
Similarly, the Bayesian negative rate (N P V ) is
P (I)P (A|I) + P (¬I)P (A|¬I)
P (I)P (A|I)
P (I, A)
P (A)
=
P (¬I|¬A) =
(1 − B)(1 − α)
(1 − B)(1 − α) + Bβ
Clearly P P V and N P V are functions on variables B, α, β.
Their relationship is shown in Figure 5. We can see that
both P P V and N P V will increase if F P and F N decrease.
This is intuitive because lower F P and F N should yield
better detection results.
Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show that F P actually dominates
P P V when the base rate is very low, which indicates that
in most operation environments (when B is very low), P P V
almost totally depends only on F P .
It also changes very
slightly with diﬀerent F N values. For example, when F P =
0.01, if we vary F N from 0.01 to 0.1, P P V remains almost
the same. This shows that P P V is not sensitive to F N .
Figure 5(c) shows P P V is not as sensitive to F N as CID.
Similarly, Figures 5(d), 5(e), and 5(f) show that N P V is
not sensitive to F P and F N .
To conclude, both P P V and N P V are useful for an evalu-
ating of IDS from a usability point of view. However, similar
to the situation with T P and F P , there is no existing objec-
tive method to integrate these metrics. On the other hand,
H(X|Y ) can be expanded as
H(X|Y ) = −B(1 − β) log P P V − Bβ log (1 − N P V )
−(1 − B)(1 − α) log N P V − (1 − B)α log (1 − P P V )
We can see that our new metric CID has incorporated
both P P V and N P V in measuring the intrusion detection
capability. CID, in fact, uniﬁes all existing commonly used
metrics, i.e., T P , F P , P P V , and N P V . It also factors in
the base rate, a measure of the IDS operation environment.
3.3 Sensitivity Analysis
We already see one important advantage of CID over ex-
it is a single uniﬁed metric, very intuitive
isting metrics:
and appealing, with a grounding in information theory.
In this section, we analyze in depth why CID is more sen-
sitive than traditional measures in realistic situations (i.e.,
where the base rate is low).
IDS design and deployment
often results in slight changes in these parameters. For
example, when ﬁne-tuning an IDS (e.g., setting a thresh-
old), diﬀerent operation points have diﬀerent T P and F P .
Being sensitive means that CID can be used to measure
even slight improvements to an IDS. P P V and N P V , on
the other hand, require more dramatic improvements to an
IDS to yield measurable diﬀerences. Similarly, CID pro-
vides a fairer comparison of two IDSs because, for example,
a slightly better F N actually shows more of an improve-
ment in capability than in P P V . In short, CID is a more
“precise” metric.
As we know, the scales of P P V, N P V, CID are all the
same, i.e., from 0 to 1. This provides a fair situation to
test their sensitivity. To investigate how much more sensi-
tive CID is compared to P P V and N P V , we can perform
a diﬀerential analysis of base rate B, false positive F P , and
false negatives F N to study the eﬀect of changing these pa-
rameters on P P V , N P V , and CID. We can assume that

B  1 and α  1, i.e., for most IDSs and their operation
environments, the base rate and false positive rates are very
low. Approximate derivatives and detailed steps are shown
in our technical report [8]. Note that although we originally
plot Figure 6 according to their equations, where we sim-
plify B  1 and α  1, it turns out we will obtain almost
the same ﬁgures when we do the numerical solution on the
diﬀerential formula of P P V, N P V , and CID without any
simpliﬁcation on B, α.
Figure 6 shows the derivatives (in absolute value) for dif-
ferent metrics. We need to see only the absolute value of the
derivative. A larger derivative value shows more sensitivity
to changes. For example, in Figure 6(a), a change in the
base rate results in a slight change in N P V . P P V improves
with the change, but not as much as CID. Clearly, from
Figure 6, we can see that CID is more sensitive to changes
in B, F P , F N than P P V and N P V .
For small base rates and false negative rates, P P V is more
sensitive to changes in the base rate than changes in F P . It
is least sensitive to F N . Given the same base rate and F P ,
the change of F N has a very small eﬀect on P P V , implying
that for a large diﬀerence in F N but a small diﬀerence in
F P , the IDS with the smaller F P will have a better P P V .
For example, suppose we have two IDSs with the same base
rate B = 0.00001, IDS1 has F P = 0.2%, F N = 1% while
IDS2 has F P = 0.1%, F N = 30%. Although IDS1 has a
far lower F N (1%  30%) and slightly higher F P (0.2% >
0.1%), its P P V (0.0049) is still lower than IDS2 (0.007).
On the other hand, its CID (0.4870) is greater than IDS2
(0.3374).
N P V , on the other hand, is more sensitive to B and F N
and it does not change much when F P changes. This implies
that for a large diﬀerence in F P but a small diﬀerence in
F N , the one with the smaller F N will have a better N P V .
For example, two IDS’s with the same base rate 0.00001,
IDS1 has F P = 0.1%, F N = 2% while IDS2 has F P = 2%,
F N = 1%. Although IDS1 has far lower F P (0.1%  2%)
and slightly higher F N (2% > 1%), its N P V (0.999998) is
still lower than IDS2 (0.99999898). On the other hand, its
CID (0.4014) is greater than IDS2 (0.2555).
Hence, CID is a more precise and sensitive measure than
P P V and N P V .
4. PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT US-
ING CID
4.1 Selection of Optimal Operating Point
CID factors in all existing measurements, i.e., B, F P ,
F N , P P V , and N P V , and is the appropriate performance
measure to maximize when ﬁne tuning an IDS (so as to se-
lect the best IDS operation point). The obtained operation
point is the best that can be achieved by the IDS in terms of
its intrinsic ability to classify input data. For anomaly detec-
tion systems, we can change some threshold in the detection
algorithm so that we can achieve diﬀerent corresponding F P
and F N and create an ROC curve. In order to obtain the
best optimized operational point, we can calculate a corre-
sponding CID for every point in the ROC. We then select
the point which gives the highest CID, and the threshold
corresponding to this point provides the optimal threshold
for use in practice.
We ﬁrst give a numerical example. We take the two ROC

Figure 5: Positive and Negative Predictive Value. These plots, similar to those in Figures 4 show that P P V
and N P V are not sensitive measures when the base rate is low. In (a), changes in β (for the same α values)
have nearly no eﬀect on P P V . In (b) for a low base rate, changes in α have a small eﬀect on P P V . The
insensitivity of P P V is also seen in (c), where changes in β do not result in large changes in P P V . The same

examples from [6]. These two intrusion detectors, denoted
as IDS1 and IDS2, have ROC curves that were determined
from data in the 1998 DARPA oﬀ-line intrusion detection
evaluation [7]. We do not address how these ROC curves
were obtained, and instead merely use them to demonstrate
how one selects an optimized operating point using CID.
As in [6], the IDS1 ROC can be approximated as 1− β =
0.6909 × (1 − exp(−65625.64α1.19)). The IDS2 ROC is ap-
proximated as 1−β = 0.4909×(1−exp(−11932.6α1.19)). For
both IDSs, the base rate is B = 43/660000 = 6.52 × 10−5.
From these two ROC curves, we can get their corresponding
CID curves in Figure 7.
We can see that IDS1 achieves the best CID (0.4557)
when the false positive rate is approximately 0.0003 (cor-
responding to detection rate 1 − β = 0.6807). Therefore,
this point (with the corresponding threshold) provides the
best optimized operating point for IDS1. The optimized
operating point for IDS2 is approximately α = 0.001, 1 −
β = 0.4711 and the corresponding maximized CID is 0.2403.
Thus, to set the optimized threshold, one merely has to cal-
culate a CID for each known point (for its T P and F P ) on
the ROC curve and then select the maximum.
4.2 Comparison of Different IDSs
When we get the maximized CID for every IDS, we can
compare their CID to tell which IDS has a better intrusion
detection capability. For example, in the previous section,
clearly IDS1 is better than IDS2 because it has a higher
CID. Granted, in this case, IDS1 and IDS2 can be easily
compared just from ROC curves. However, in many cases,
comparing ROC curves is not straightforward, particularly
when the curves cross.
Consider another simple numerical example with the data
taken from [12]. We compare two IDSs that have only single
point ROC curves (for PROBE attacks). IDS1 has F P =
1/660, 000, T P = 0.88, while IDS2 has F P = 7/660, 000,
T P = 0.97. The base rate here is B = 17/(17 + 660, 000).
We note these single point curves were critiqued in [15], but
here we use it merely as a simple numerical example of how
CID might compare two IDSs. IDS1 has CID = 0.8390, and
IDS2 has CID = 0.8881. Thus, IDS2 is a little better than
IDS1. Reaching this same conclusion using just the ROC
curves in [12] is not obvious.
The relative CID between diﬀerent IDSs is fairly stable
even if the base rate in realistic situations may change a
little. This can be easily seen from Figure 3(a). The four
curves do not intersect within the range of the base rate
from 10−7 to 10−1.
