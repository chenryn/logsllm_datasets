User: Please name at least 3 common load balancing algorithms and briefly explain their differences.
Assistant: 1. Round Robin Algorithm: The load is distributed to different servers in turn according to the pre-assigned weight and sequence, ensuring that each server receives approximately the same number of requests. However, when the performance and load of the servers are different or the distribution of access traffic is uneven, the polling algorithm may cause some servers to be overloaded and reduce the performance of the entire system. 2. Weighted round-robin algorithm: Similar to the round-robin algorithm, the difference is that the servers are assigned different weights, and the load is distributed according to the weight ratio, so that the servers with stronger performance can share more traffic. This makes the system more flexible and reliable. 3. IP hash algorithm: Calculate the client IP address and server address through a hash function, and then distribute the request to the corresponding server. This algorithm can assign requests to the same server based on some information about the client's IP address, improving the cache hit rate. However, if the number of servers changes, the hash table needs to be recalculated, which increases the complexity of the system.
