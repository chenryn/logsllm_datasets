day 1 October 1st, 2016 and day 31 October 31st, 2016), while y-axis reports
the cumulative fraction of subscriptions that accessed at least one WP website.
Considering a single day, less than 12% of subscriptions accessed WP, but this
fraction raises to 27% after a week. At the end of the month it reaches 38%,
meaning that more than one subscription over three generated traﬃc toward
WP websites at least once in a month. For comparison, YouTube and Netﬂix
are daily accessed by 45% and 3% of subscribers respectively. Considering social
networks, 60% and 25% of subscribers contact Facebook and Instagram on a
daily basis, respectively.7

4.3 WP Websites at a Glance
In this section, we brieﬂy describe WP website popularity and pervasiveness.
Similarly to the Internet global trend, the market is dominated by few big play-
ers. Looking at the Alexa rank, (See footnote 1) three WP websites appear among
the top-50, namely pornhub.com, xvideos.com and livejasmin.com, with the ﬁrst
one ranked 29th, just behind linkedin.com. Considering our dataset, we observe
a similar situation, with over-the-top companies leading the rank. In Fig. 7 we
show the percentage of users reached by the top-15 WP websites using bars
(left-most y-axis), and the cumulative percentage of visits to these services (red
line, right-most y-axis). In total users accessed 7 048 diﬀerent websites during the
entire month. The top-3 websites in our dataset match exactly Alexa rank, with
pornhub.com being accessed by 34% of the users. Global tendencies are reﬂected
in our top-15, with only 2 omitted websites as local representative of the mon-
itored country. Considering the percentage of visited webpages, pornhub.com
alone accounts for 14% of them, and the top-15 together approximately 63%
of all WP visits. The percentage reaches 90% considering the top-204 websites,
conﬁrming the concentration of users around top services. Interestingly, very
similar numbers hold for the overall traﬃc (including also non-WP websites),
with top-15 accounting for 61% of traﬃc and 90% due to 195 websites.
Finally, we notice that 3 out of 15 WP websites of Fig. 7 belong to MindGeek,
a company owning pornhub.com, redtube.com, youporn.com, and dozens of other
websites.8 MindGeek websites account for more than 20% of accesses in our
dataset, making it a market leader. For comparison, the second website in terms
of users and visits is xvideos.com (owned by WGCZ Holding), with less than
half the users of MindGeek services, according to our data, suggesting a scenario
where the ecosystem is lead by few big players in a dominant position.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we oﬀered a quantitative analysis concerning web pornography
consumption. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to use network
passive measurements to study the interactions of users with these services.
We followed an exploratory approach on data, focusing on questions, topics and
metrics typically analyzed in previous surveys and research works, e.g., frequency
of fruition and the time spent on WP. We found interesting results, some typical
of the observed population and others capable of conﬁrming global trends.
Our results draw the attention to a large and active group of users, and
may be helpful for researchers that study web services consumption and human
behavior at large. The obtained outcomes can be checked and veriﬁed, thanks
to the fact that we release our anonymized dataset. Furthermore, the chosen
metrics allowed a comparison with outcomes of previously conducted surveys,
and mostly conﬁrmed their results.
