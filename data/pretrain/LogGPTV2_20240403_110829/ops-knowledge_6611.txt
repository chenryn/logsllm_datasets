Question: "In the context of iOS and iPadOS, why are different keybags used, and what are the potential security implications of using a backup keybag with a weak password?"
 "A": "User keybag is used for normal operation, and using a backup keybag with a weak password can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks."
 "B": "Device keybag stores keys for shared device configurations, and a weak password does not affect its security due to its user passcode independence."
 "C": "Escrow keybag allows Finder or iTunes syncing without a passcode, and a weak backup keybag password does not impact its security."
 "D": "The backup keybag is protected by a password and a weak password makes it susceptible to parallelised brute-force attacks."
