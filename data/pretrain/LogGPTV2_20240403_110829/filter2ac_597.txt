### ATT&CK Technique: Audit (ID: M1047)

To mitigate path interception vulnerabilities, follow these steps:

1. **Review and Secure Configuration Files and Scripts:**
   - Identify and eliminate path interception weaknesses in program configuration files, scripts, the `PATH` environment variable, services, and shortcuts.
   - Enclose `PATH` variables in quotation marks whenever the function or script allows it. This helps prevent unintended directory traversal and ensures that the correct executable is invoked.

2. **Understand and Manage Search Order:**
   - Be aware of the search order that Windows uses for executing or loading binaries. Use fully qualified paths wherever possible to ensure that the intended executable is executed, thereby reducing the risk of path interception.

3. **Maintain a Clean Registry:**
   - Remove old Windows Registry keys when software is uninstalled. This practice helps avoid orphaned keys that may point to non-existent or malicious binaries.

4. **Regular Audits and Reporting:**
   - Periodically scan your systems for path interception weaknesses. Use custom or available tools to identify software with insecure path configurations.
   - Correct any identified issues or report them to the appropriate team for remediation.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of path interception attacks and enhance the overall security of your systems.
