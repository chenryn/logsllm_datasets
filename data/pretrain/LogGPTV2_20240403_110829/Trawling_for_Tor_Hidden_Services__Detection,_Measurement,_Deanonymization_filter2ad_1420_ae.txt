1) Expected degree of nodes in the Tor network graph:
In order to derive the expected degree of a Tor relay we use
results presented in [3], section 5.2. In [3], the probability of
a TLS connection between two Tor relays at a given point
in time is computed as ratio of the average gap between
connections to the average connection duration. We denote
tavg as the average circuit duration and tidle as the lifetime
of a connection without circuits. According to empirical
results presented [3], the average duration of a circuit is 200
seconds and according to the current Tor implementation,
the lifetime of a connection without circuits is set to three
minutes.
Assuming a delay larger than tavg + tidle, the average
delay between two circuits is computed as:

tavg+tidle
I =
t · λa,b · e−λa,b·tdt
eλa,b·(tavg+tidle)

The probability that there is a connection between A and
B at an arbitrary point in time is given by:

where R is the current circuit arrival rate of the whole Tor
network, and pa,b is the probability of routers A and B to
form an edge in a circuit and λa,b = R·pa,b. The probability
pa,b is approximated as follows:
(cid:3)
pa,b = 2 · bwabwb

(cid:4)

where bwguards is the total bandwidth of guard nodes,
bwexit is the total bandwidth of exit nodes, bwtotal is the
total bandwidth of the whole Tor network, bwa and bwb are
bandwidths of routers A and B respectively. This information
is obtained from the consensus document.
The expected number of open connections of a Tor relay
at an arbitrary point of time is thus:
N avg
A = (cid:2)
PAB(cid:3),
(cid:5)
B∈T
where T denotes the set of all Tor relays and |T| = n.
We now compare the model with the observed degrees
of Tor relays. We used the technique described in [3] in
order determine to which other relays a given Tor relay has
established TLS connections. Figure 7 shows the degrees
of Tor relays sorted by their bandwidth weight from the
consensus.

Figure 7. Degrees of Tor relays
From this ﬁgure, one can see that there are a number of
nodes which deviate signiﬁcantly from the average – we call
these peak nodes. The guard nodes of the botnet which we
determined in the previous section are marked by arrows and
are among the peaks. This allows us to ﬁlter out quite many
relays. However the number of peaks is still considerable. In
the next section we show how to reduce the set of candidates
of guard nodes of a popular hidden service based on the
persistent connection decay rate.
2) Decay rate of persistent connections: As mentioned
in [3], for an average Tor relay the decay rate of persistent
connections is steep during the ﬁrst hours. This is not the
case if a relay is a guard node of a hidden service with
persistently connected clients, such as the botnet’s IRC
command and control. In this case the decay rate will be
determined by the bots going ofﬂine rather than by the
bandwidth of the node.
In order to predict the decay rate of a “normal” Tor relay
we use the following approach: We ﬁrst ﬁnd the expression
for the duration of a connection between relay A and B and
use it to determine the connection decay rate. We assume
the following: 1) circuits arrive to the connections according
to Poisson distribution [3]; 2) the circuit arrival rate is
proportional to the bandwidth of the relay; 3) the circuit
duration follows an exponential distribution. Given these
assumptions, we adopt a ﬁnite state Markov chain to model
the connection duration. Each state of the Markov chain
represents the number of circuits carried over the connection.
The chain has one absorbing state 0. We are interested in
the extinction time. The number of states is ﬁnite.
We assume that at the time when we observe the con-
nections, the system is in quasistationary state, conditioned
that the extinction has not occurred. Thus the initial state
distribution is a quasi-stationary distribution which always
exists for ﬁnite state case (see [16] , [6]). Classical matrix
theory can be used to show that a matrix containing in-
ﬁnitesimal transition probabilities of transient states has a
dominant eigenvalue such that the corresponding left and
right eigenvectors have positive entries (see [16], and [6]);
the left eigenvector is the quasistationary distribution. We
denote (q1, q2, ..., qN ) as the row vector of quasistationary
probabilities.
Let λ be the circuit arrival rate to a connection between
two Tor relays and μ the circuit closing rate. In this case,
the matrix of inﬁnitesimal transition probabilities is:
(cid:6)
(cid:7)
R =
0
0
a C
,
(3)
where the matrix C corresponds to transient states T =
{1, 2, ..N} and state 0 is absorbing. The matrix C can be
written as:

The probability of extinction of a connection between
relays A and B in this case can then be derived as (we
use Kolmogorov forward equations to get this result):

The circuit arrival rate λa,b is computed as in the previous
subsection. We set the circuit closing rate as μ = 1/(tavg +
tidle), where tavg is the average duration of a circuit as
in [3] and tidle = 180 seconds is the time before an idle
connection would close. As stated in [3], tavg depends only
slightly on the pair of relays and is close to 200 seconds.
One can use numerical methods (see [21] for example) to
compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Note that for the
cases when λa,b < μ, one can approximate the values with
an expression for inﬁnite state Markov chain [23]. In the
inﬁnite case, the quasistationary probability for the system
to be in state j is:
Using the technique from [3] we obtained the persistent
connections decay rate of the Tor guard nodes. We compared
them with the connection decay rate predicted by the model
and ﬁltered those connections which differ from the model.
Particularly, we compared the number of persistent connec-
tions after 3 hours of scanning. Out of 856 nodes 200 had
a degree that exceeded the value predicted by the model.
Choosing a threshold such that guard of the botnet’s hidden
service is included, we ﬁnd that 37 nodes have a degree that
is 1.4 time higher than the value predicted by the model.
Figure 9 shows the real decay rate of the botnet’s guard
nodes plotted against the theoretically predicted one. As one
can see, the discrepancy is quite detectable.
qj = (1 − β)
2jβj−1,
(cid:14)
where β =
λ
μ. Particularly,
q1 = (1 − β)

We apply this model to the pair of medium-bandwidth
Tor relays for which the experimental data was presented
in [3]. The consensus bandwidths of the relays were 1850
kBytes/sec and 4280 kBytes/sec. Both were Guard and non-
Exit nodes. The comparison between the model and the data
obtained from the direct measurements on one of the nodes
is shown in Figure 8.

Figure 9. Decay rate of the botnet’s guard 1
Figure 10 shows the observed decay rate and the predicted
decay rate of another node with a degree above the average
(one of the peaks in Figure 7). The majority of peaks from
the previous section have this type of the decay rate, which
is close to the theoretical predictions. This allows us to
reduce the number of candidates to 29. Since we know the
actual guard nodes of the botnet’s hidden service from the
unencrypted descriptor attack, we were able to check that
indeed the correct guards appeared in this list of candidates.
