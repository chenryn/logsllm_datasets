# Introduction

Enterprise APIs have become the common way of exposing business functions to the outside world. While this exposure is convenient, it comes with the risk of exploitation. This book is about securing your most important business assets or APIs. Often, the security element is ignored during the API design phase, only to be addressed at deployment or integration. Security should never be an afterthought; it is an integral part of any software system design and should be well thought out from the inception. One objective of this book is to educate readers about the need for security and the available options for securing APIs.

The book guides you through the process and shares best practices for designing APIs for better security. API security has evolved significantly in recent years, with the growth of standards for securing APIs being exponential. OAuth 2.0 is the most widely adopted standard, serving as a framework for building solutions. The book explains in depth how to secure APIs, from traditional HTTP Basic authentication to OAuth 2.0 and related profiles such as OpenID Connect, User-Managed Access (UMA), and more.

JSON plays a major role in API communication. Most modern APIs support only JSON, not XML. The book focuses on JSON security, covering standards like JSON Web Encryption (JWE) and JSON Web Signature (JWS) in detail.

Another major objective of the book is to present concepts and theories with concrete examples. The book provides a comprehensive set of examples to illustrate how to apply theory in practice. You will learn about using OAuth 2.0 and related profiles to access APIs securely with web applications, single-page applications, native mobile applications, and browser-less applications.

I hope this book effectively covers a much-needed subject matter for API developers and that you enjoy reading it.

# Chapter 1: APIs Rule!

Enterprise API adoption has exceeded expectations, with APIs proliferating across almost all industries. A business without an API is like a computer without the Internet. APIs are also the foundation for building communication channels in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, enabling countless devices to communicate with each other.

### API Economy

According to an infographic published by the ACI Information Group, the global Internet economy is around $10 trillion. In 1984, the Internet linked 1,000 hosts at universities and corporates. By 1998, the number of Internet users globally reached 50 million. It took 11 years to reach 1 billion users in 2009, and just three years to double that number. In 2019, more than half of the world’s population—about 4.3 billion people—use the Internet. Initiatives like Facebook's Internet.org and Google Loon aim to further increase this number by connecting more people in rural and remote areas.

The success of the Internet of Things (IoT) is driven by two key enablers: APIs and Big Data. According to a report by Wipro Council for Industry Research, a six-hour flight on a Boeing 737 generates 120 terabytes of data. By 2020, the amount of data globally is estimated to climb to 35 zettabytes, with 90% of the data generated in the last couple of years. APIs are the glue that connects devices to each other and to the cloud.

### The API Economy

The API economy refers to how organizations can become profitable or successful in their business domains through APIs. IBM estimated the API economy to become a $2.2 trillion market by 2018. The IBM Redbook, "The Power of the API Economy," defines the API economy as the commercial exchange of business functions, capabilities, or competencies as services using web APIs. The main reasons for enterprises to embrace web APIs include:

- Growing the customer base by attracting customers through API ecosystems.
- Driving innovation by capitalizing on the composition of different APIs.
- Improving the time-to-value and time-to-market for new products.
- Enhancing integration with web APIs.
- Opening up possibilities for a new era of computing and preparing for a flexible future.

### Case Studies

#### Amazon
Amazon was one of the first enterprises to adopt APIs to expose its business functionalities. In 2006, it started offering IT infrastructure services through web APIs, leading to the creation of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Former Amazon employee Steve Yegge shared that Jeff Bezos mandated a service-oriented infrastructure, which transformed Amazon from a bookseller to a global retailer in IT and cloud services.

#### Salesforce
Salesforce, launched in February 1999, is a leader in the software-as-a-service space. Its web API was a key factor in its success, allowing it to build a larger ecosystem around its platform.

#### Uber
Uber, a transportation network company, uses the Google Maps API to provide location services. This benefits both Uber and Google, as Google gains insights into user behavior, which can be used to improve its ad engine.

#### Facebook
Facebook launched its platform in 2007, making its core capabilities available to application developers. The Facebook Graph API is used by 1 million websites, according to builtwith.com.

#### Netflix
Netflix, a popular media streaming service, announced its first public API in 2008. Today, it supports over a thousand types of devices and processes billions of API requests daily.

#### Walgreens
Walgreens, the largest drug retailing chain in the United States, opened up its photo printing and pharmacies to the public via APIs in 2012/2013. This attracted many developers and enhanced customer engagement.

#### Governments
Governments have also started exposing their capabilities via APIs. For example, Data.gov, managed by the US General Services Administration, launched initiatives to improve public access to high-value, machine-readable datasets.
