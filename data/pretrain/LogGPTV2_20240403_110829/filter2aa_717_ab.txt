### Blackhat USA 2013 Presentation Summary

**Date:** August 1, 2013  
**Presenters:** Cui, Costello, Kataria, Stolfo

#### Overview
This presentation at Blackhat USA 2013, held on August 1, 2013, covered various aspects of offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques. The presenters, Cui, Costello, Kataria, and Stolfo, demonstrated both offensive and defensive strategies, with a focus on the use of software symbiotes for device security.

#### Key Points

- **Barnaby_prime Function**
  - **Description:** Permanent modification function.
  - **Details:** This function is designed to make permanent changes to a device's firmware or memory, which can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes.

- **Offense Techniques**
  - **Jtagulator:**
    - **Description:** A tool for identifying JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interfaces on devices.
    - **Usage:** Described as "Awesome Sauce" for its effectiveness in hardware hacking.
  - **Thank You, Joe Grand!**
    - **Acknowledgment:** Special thanks to Joe Grand for his contributions to the field.

- **Defense Strategies**
  - **Software Symbiote Defense:**
    - **Platforms:**
      - ARM
      - MIPS
      - Cisco 7961G
      - Cisco 2821 & 1841
      - HP 2055 LaserJet
    - **Functionality:** Software symbiotes are embedded into the device's firmware to monitor and protect against unauthorized modifications.

- **Market and Legal Implications**
  - **Vendor Indifference:**
    - **Reasons:** Vendors may not prioritize security due to market pressures and lack of immediate consequences.
    - **Quote:** "What you don’t see won’t hurt you…"
  - **Future Concerns:**
    - **Device Security:** As more devices become interconnected, the risk of one device attacking another (e.g., phones attacking servers) increases.
    - **Legal Liability:** The legal implications of such attacks have not been fully tested but are likely to become a significant issue.

- **Government Involvement:**
  - **Role:** Government regulations and oversight will play a crucial role in shaping the future of device security.
  - **Customer Awareness:**
    - **Impact:** Increased customer awareness will drive vendors to improve security measures.
    - **Readiness:** Software symbiotes are ready to be deployed to enhance device security.

- **SunSet @ P3wnT0wn:**
  - **Event:** A special event or demonstration related to the presentation.

#### Offense Demo
- **Reverse Tunneling:**
  - **Description:** Demonstrated a reverse tunnel from a printer to an outside host.
  - **Steps:**
    - Launched the offense konsole and added the printer as a target.
    - Issued a synscan command over the tunnel to find network targets.
    - Used the printer to map MAC addresses to IP addresses.
    - Renamed a target device (Recon4) to phone2.
    - Performed ARP poisoning to make phone2 think the printer was its TFTP server.
    - Built a proxy from the printer to an outside host.
    - SSHed into the phone through the printer proxy using an authorized_keys file.
    - Wrote a small block to the MTD containing a setuid shell-popping binary to gain root access.
    - Added all offense targets to the konsole and performed memory fingerprinting.
    - Looked up pre-computed values about the printer in an offline firmware database.
    - Read and wrote to the phone's memory using command and control packets.
    - Demonstrated normal Cisco router behavior and bypassed the enable secret.
    - Modified the 'show version' output to display Barnaby Jack’s face.
    - Caused a Denial of Service (DOS) attack on the router, driving CPU utilization to 99%.

#### Defense Demo
- **Symbiote Protection:**
  - **Description:** Demonstrated the effectiveness of software symbiotes in detecting and responding to exploits.
  - **Steps:**
    - Launched an exploit on a Cisco 7961 phone.
    - Detected changes in static memory regions and reported checksum changes.
    - Simulated an exploit on a router by modifying the 'show cdp neighbor' command.
    - Detected and responded to simulated attacks on Cisco 2821 and 1841 routers.
    - Used the printer's command and control write command to change printer memory and detected the exploit.
