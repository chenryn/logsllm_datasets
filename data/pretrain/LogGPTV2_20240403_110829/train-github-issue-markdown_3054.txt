I noticed the sample for **firebase_auth** is based on just **phone** and
**goggle** authentication. (I got the **googleSignin** working following your
example).
**Question**  
Will there be a **Facebook** and **Twitter** signin example from the
firebase_auth team anytime soon -- since the firebase claims **"supporting
email and password accounts, phone auth, and Google, Twitter, Facebook, and
GitHub login, and more"** see https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/
  1. Are there any plans to to provide this functionality (samples)?
  2. Are there any plans to support Microsoft Azure/Azure B2C authentication? they are an OIDC provider; Azure B2C supports Google-Signin.
  3. In the absence of (2) are there plans to support 'generic' OIDC providers? This will help us fill in he 'gaps'
  4. Can you share some kind of a planned feature timeline with us?
BTW: the documentation on setting up/configuring the app was **right-on.** The
only problem I had was in the integration with the Firebase Console. As you
know we search the web for possible solutions. All my approaches failed until
after the better part of an extended full day, I stumbled upon a codelabs
'tutorial' which pointed out that the SHA1 fingerprint for **debugging** must
use the 'debug.keystore' in **%USERINFO%** (windows environment). Once I did
that, my google Sign-in worked in seconds.
I suggest you either specify that on the setup page or provide a link to the
relevant info. I know it might be obvious to you -- bust just that one
sentence could have save me over 10 hours..
