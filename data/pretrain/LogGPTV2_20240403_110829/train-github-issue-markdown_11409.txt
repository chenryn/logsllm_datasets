I am following the 5-minute Quick Start guide available at:  
[Angular 2 Quick Start Guide](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html)

However, I encountered the following error in my browser:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
PI:EMAIL:1 Potentially unhandled rejection [3] Error
loading "appone" at https://registry.jspm.io/appone.js
Not Found: https://registry.jspm.io/appone.js (WARNING: non-Error used)
```

The error occurs in the `appone.html` file, which has the following content:

```html
<!-- appone.html -->
<h1>Angular 2 Quickstart</h1>
```

### Environment Information:
- **TypeScript Version:** 1.5.3
- **Browsers:** Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome 44 (Both browsers exhibit the same issue)

Could you please help me resolve this problem?
