the *DeviceProcessEvents* would have been your best choice. First, we
filter most of the events by only selecting filenames that end with
.key. This filter is made first because it will improve the speed of the
query. parse_path will longer, thus with the filtered result only a
subset of the rows needs to be parsed to collect the RootPath and
DirectoryPath. The rest of the query filters only on file creations in
the \*C:\* directory.

## Process Based Behaviors
Next up are the process-based behaviours, which are the most valuable of
all the indicators mentioned in the threat reports. This is also in some
essence shown in the tables containing the IOCs, the fidelity column
classifies all the commands as *high*. As could already be derived from
the name of this behaviour we need to have logs that relate to processes
and their creation, this can come in many forms, such as
DeviceProcessEvents, SecurityEvents or Syslog. The deriviced commandline
executions are listed below.

To show the workings I have taken a subset of the commands mentioned
above and put them in a dynamic list, but to improve the results I have
not put the whole command in this list, only the variables. The
separation between the variable and the file that initiates the command
is done because the command line logs can differ for example
*"wevtutil.exe" cl system* will not be matched if I had put all the full
commands in the dynamic list. The second list is all the files that
initiate the commands, they are logged in a separate field and can
thereby be used as a filter, resulting in the query below.
::: highlight
``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
let Commands = dynamic(['cl system','cl security', 'cl application', @'delete shadows /all /quiet', 
    'list shadows', @'shadowcopy /nointeractive', @'shadowcopy delete']);
let IntiatingFiles = dynamic(['wevtutil.exe', 'vssadmin.exe', 'wmic.exe', 'bcdedit.exe', 'rundll32.exe']);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "wevtutil.exe"
| where FileName in~ (IntiatingFiles)
| extend ToLowerProcessCommandLine = tolower(ProcessCommandLine)
| project ProcessCommandLine, FileName, DeviceName
```
:::
The commands that have been executed are quite specific therefore only
focussing on the commandlines mentioned above is not enough. For
example, if the ransomware operator wakes up one day and decides to run
*wevtutil.exe clean-log system* instead of *wevtutil.exe cl system* the
query above will not show any results. Therefore it is important to
further dive into every technique/process that is executed. Let's
discuss how you can do this by looking at the *wevtutil.exe* and
*taskkill* events.
#### Wevtutil.exe {#wevtutilexe}
Wevtutil is in this specific case used to clear event logs, this
activity is also classified within MITRE ATT&CK as *Indicator Removal:
Clear Windows Event Logs*
[(T1070.001)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001/){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreffer"} within the tactic Defense Evasion. Of course,
there are more ways to clear the event logs but these threat actors have
chosen this approach. A threat hunt to this particular technique can be
very interesting ;)!
::: highlight
``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
wevtutil.exe cl system
wevtutil.exe cl security
wevtutil.exe cl application
```
:::
The first step is understanding how this specific technique is executed
and how the program that initiates the action operates. The [wevtutil
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/wevtutil){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreffer"} contains the following syntax which is relevant
for this particular technique, removing indicators:
``` {tabindex="0"}
{cl | clear-log} 
```
This allows us to not only hunt the *cl* execution but more importantly
also include *clear-log*. This results in the query mentioned below
([Link for more
context](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Hunting-Queries-Detection-Rules/blob/main/Defender%20For%20Endpoint/WevtutilClearLogs.md){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreffer"}). This combines the information that is
mentioned in the documentation, a command line must have wevtutil.exe
and cl or clear-log.

Even though it was not the goal of this blog to determine how well
Defender For Endpoint was able to detect these ransomware activities, it
is good to see that many alerts have been triggered. Only processes
mentioned in the two #StopRansomware have been executed and that
resulted in all these alerts.

#### Taskkill
The last investigation for this blog is related to the taskkill commands
that are mentioned in the report. This is a very specific list of
executables that are killed. Note that all the tasks are related to some
SQL service, this is something we can use while developing a query. But
keep in mind that adversaries only need to change one parameter or leave
one out and you will not detect anything if you try to detect the full
command execution. To know exactly what taskkill can do we again take a
look at the
[documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/taskkill){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreffer"} to analyse the executed command, */f* is a
force parameter and */im* specifies the name of the process to kill.
::: highlight
``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
cmd.exe /q /c taskkill /f /im sqlwriter.exe /im winmysqladmin.exe /im w3sqlmgr.exe /im sqlwb.exe 
    /im sqltob.exe /im sqlservr.exe /im sqlserver.exe /im sqlscan.exe /im sqlbrowser.exe 
    /im sqlrep.exe /im sqlmangr.exe /im sqlexp3.exe /im sqlexp2.exe /im sqlex
```
:::
To ensure that we will still detect this behaviour, even though an
adversary might have changed the approach we start by defining which
logs are needed. As already mentioned above process behaviours are
related to commandline logs, thus we pick the *DeviceProcessEvents*
table. Also note that in this case cmd.exe is used, but the same command
without that part can be executed in PowerShell, be smarter than the
adversary and be critical of what to include and what to exclude in your
hunting query.
The query relies on two different variables as input, the
TotalKilledThreshold variable determines how many different processes
need to be killed, the example above contains 14 different processes
that are killed, by altering this variable you can also detect subsets
of the executed commandline. The TotalParametersThreshold variable
determines how many parameters have to be used in the commandline.
::: highlight
``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
let TotalKilledThreshold = 10;
let TotalParametersThreshold = 10;
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName == "taskkill.exe"
| extend CommandLineParameters = split(ProcessCommandLine, " ")
| extend TotalParameters = array_length(CommandLineParameters)
// Extract allSQL related processes in the CommandLineParameters
| mv-apply KilledProcess = CommandLineParameters on (
    where KilledProcess contains "sql"
    | project KilledProcess
)
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *), AllKilledProcess = make_set(KilledProcess) by ReportId
| extend TotalKilledProcesses = array_length(AllKilledProcess)
| project-reorder Timestamp, ProcessCommandLine, TotalParameters, TotalKilledProcesses
| where TotalKilledProcesses >= TotalKilledThreshold and TotalParameters >= TotalParametersThreshold

# Detecting Ransomware Threats
To strengthen your detection and/or hunting capabilities the [KQL
Repository](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Hunting-Queries-Detection-Rules){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreffer"} contains queries that can help you develop
those capabilities. This section will discuss some of those queries and
what value they could bring to your environment.

MDE uses client and cloud heuristics to determine if a file resembles ransomware. This file could for example be the script that is used to encrypt files. No alert is generated by default by Defender For Endpoint, therefore it is recommended to create a custom detection rule to alert on this ASR trigger.

A shadow copy is a backup or snapshot of a system, and often deleted by ransomware groups.

That is one of the characteristics of discovery/reconnaissance tools. The SMB sessions can be used to identify remote systems, which is often done to map the network.
