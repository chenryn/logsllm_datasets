but more efﬁcient representations can be used since some
of the states are redundant, if the servers do not need to be
distinguished.
The cluster model therefore can be represented as a
M/MMPP/1 queueing system with a standard Quasi-Birth
Death representation, for which a matrix geometric solution
can be numerically obtained, see [15, 9].
Note that in principle QBDs can also be described with
other methods, such as inﬁnite stochastic Petri Nets [16],
but as we had mapped the cluster system to a simple
M/MMPP/1 queueing system, where the MMPP has a struc-
tured form when using matrix-exponential distributions, the
use of high-level description tools is not necessary. Alter-
natively, the heavy-tailed repair periods can be modeled as
occasional heavy-tailed services, where the repair and the
consecutive re-service are viewed as one long service, and
in which case the model would lend itself to an M/G/1 or
M/G/c type analysis, see [2, 10].
The matrix-geometric solution allows to compute ex-
plicit formulas for the mean queue length and for the tail
probabilities of the queue-length distribution. The tail prob-
ability of the queue-length distribution, P r(Q > k) is
equivalent to the probability that the queue-length as seen
by an arriving customer is exceeding k, which for large k
is closely related to system time, i.e. the following approx-
imation links queue-length tail probabilities to system time
S:
P r(S > d) ≈ P r(Q > d¯ν).
Thereby ¯ν = N νp(A+δ(1−A)) is the average service rate.
In the case that tasks have to meet some delay requirement
d, the equation above allows to determine the probability of
violating this requirement.
2.3. Resemblance to Bursty Teletraﬃc
Models
The MMPP model that has been developed in Section 2.2
as a single-server approximation of the cluster service pro-
cess, very closely resembles a class of models well known
in communication network performance analysis, although
there the MMPP models have been used for arrival pro-
cesses. Packet-based network trafﬁc in many cases shows
burstiness, i.e. ﬂuctuating arrival rates, which can be mod-
eled by MMPPs, see [11]. In particular, ON/OFF behavior
of trafﬁc sources has a long history, and more recently, also
matrix-exponential distributions have been utilized [17, 19]
to reﬂect burstiness on multiple time-scales, or even self-
similar or long-range dependent trafﬁc models, see e.g.
[22, 3].
When using ON/OFF trafﬁc sources, the aggregated ar-
rival rate is modulated by the number of sources in an ON
period, hence closely resembles the scenarios for the ser-
vice times in the cluster model of this paper. In fact, the
MMPP model in Sect. 2.2 is equivalent to the aggregated
trafﬁc model, proposed ﬁrst in [17].
37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN'07)0-7695-2855-4/07 $20.00  © 2007Those trafﬁc models represent a set of N statistically
identical and independent sources that intermittently emit
data. Each of the sources is an ON/OFF model with a peak
rate of λp (during an ON period), and a mean rate of κ,
leading to the aggregate arrival rate of λ = N × κ. The
burstiness of the trafﬁc is expressed by the burst parameter,
b, which is the fraction of the time that a source is OFF.
The following table illustrates the resemblance of the
two models by comparing the parameters:

Note that the average service rate for the cluster model
is given in the table for the case of δ = 0 (crash faults).
A somewhat similar notion to a degraded service rate δνp
in the cluster model exists in trafﬁc models by assuming a
background Poisson process for the aggregation of other,
non-bursty trafﬁc.
As the queueing analysis in Section 3 will show, the per-
formance behavior of the cluster model also has many sim-
ilarities to the observed performance behavior in network
performance models. Also, the mechanisms that lead to
poor performance in case of high variance DOWN times
(corresponding to high-variance ON periods in the trafﬁc
models) are very similar.
2.4. Variations of the Analytic Model
Most of the assumptions on the analytic model can be
easily removed within the matrix-analytic framework, lead-
ing however to more complex matrices and possibly more
complexity in the queueing analysis. We do not implement
these model modiﬁcations here, but in order to show the
power of the modeling approach, we highlight how the ex-
tensions can be incorporated:
• Nonexponential task arrival processes: Any ﬁnite-
dimensional matrix exponential renewal process, or
even any MAP can be included in the analytic model.
The state space of the arrival process then has to be
included in the overall state space of the queue-length
process.
• Finite task queue at the dispatcher: The ﬁnite QBD
representing a ME/MMPP/1/K queue also has a
matrix-geometric solution. For large buffer sizes how-
ever, qualitative results are expected to be unchanged,
see [18] for arguments in a comparable setting.
• Nonexponential TTF: The model in Section 2.2 al-
ready includes matrix-exponential TTF. However, the
analysis results in the subsequent section will be
based on exponential TTFs,
results
from the corresponding teletrafﬁc models indicate
that high-variance distributions are most signiﬁcant
performance-wise in what now corresponds to the
TTR, see [21].
since earlier
• Including queue-size dependence when less than N
tasks are present: This modiﬁcation of the queue
length dependence would require a modiﬁcation in the
service events in the ﬁrst N block-rows of its QBD
matrix representation, see [20] for an example.
• Hyperexponential task times: By some extension of
the state space, namely by keeping track of the selected
phase for the (residual) times of the tasks that are be-
ing processed at one of the nodes, nonexponential task
times can also be modeled.
Furthermore, in the scenario of crash faults, discard strate-
gies for the task under execution at the failing server can
also be represented by using a MAP for the service pro-
cess, namely transitions corresponding to failures of a node
would then lead to a reduction of the queue size by 1 (one
speciﬁc instance of a ’service’ event, although unsuccessful
here).
3. Discussion of Analytic Results
We will ﬁrst present and discuss queue performance re-
sults from the analytic model, more speciﬁcally the behav-
ior of the mean queue-length and of tail-probabilities of the
queue-length distribution. All participating processes (task
arrivals, task service time, UP time) except for the repair
time are thereby assumed to be exponential. First, we look
at the case of truncated power-tail distributions for the repair
time, since those resemble closely recently used models for
teletrafﬁc.
3.1. Task queue behavior for TPT repair
times
We illustrate the behavior of the mean size of the task-
queue (also counting the tasks in service) using a cluster
with N = 2 nodes with a degradation factor δ = 0.2 while
varying the task arrival rate λ and thereby varying the uti-
lization ρ := λ/¯ν. Figure 1 shows the resulting normalized
mean queue length; normalization is thereby performed
with respect to an M/M/1 Queue at same utilization, mainly
in order to avoid the vertical asymptote of the mean queue-
length for ρ → 1. For an exponential repair time (solid line
in the bottom), the normalized mean queue-length shows no
surprising behavior, but it grows monotonously and steadily

with ρ. The growth is a consequence of the ﬂuctuations in
the service rates due to failures of the servers.
However, when truncated Power-tail distributions with
large range are used (T = 9, 10), the three different regions
with respect to ρ have to be distinguished, namely:
• For small ρ (approximately ρ 60. 9%, the mean queue-length jumps
to huge values, 100 times larger than for an M/M/1
model. Note the log-scale on the y-axis in the ﬁgure.
With increasing Power-tail range, the mean queue-
length rapidly increases.
Figure 2 shows the probability mass function of the
queue-length distributions that correspond to utilization val-
ues in the three different regions, and, for comparison, that
of an M/M/1 queue at the largest of these utilization val-
ues. The queue-length distributions show (truncated) power
law behavior, which in the utilized log-log plot appears as
straight line, for the two parameter settings belonging to the
intermediate and worst performance region in Figure 1. The
slope of the linear part, corresponding to the Power-tail ex-
ponent, however is different between the two curves. In the

Similar behavior was observed ﬁrst in [17] and then later
analyzed in more detail for teletrafﬁc models in [19]. The
underlying mechanism that causes this remarkable behav-
ior of the mean queue-length of the task queue in the clus-
ter model is the same as for teletrafﬁc models: truncated
