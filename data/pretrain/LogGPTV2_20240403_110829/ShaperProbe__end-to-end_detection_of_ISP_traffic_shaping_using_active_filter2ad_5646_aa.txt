# Title: ShaperProbe: End-to-End Detection of ISP Traffic Shaping Using Active Methods

## Authors: Partha Kanuparthy and Constantine Dovrolis

### Abstract
We present an end-to-end measurement method for detecting traffic shaping. Traffic shaping is typically implemented using token buckets, which allow a maximum burst of traffic to be serviced at the peak capacity of the link, while any remaining traffic is serviced at a lower shaping rate. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we develop an active end-to-end detection mechanism, called ShaperProbe, that can infer whether a particular path is subject to traffic shaping and, if so, estimate the shaper characteristics. Second, we analyze results from a large-scale deployment of ShaperProbe on M-Lab over the past 24 months, detecting traffic shaping in several major ISPs. Our deployment has received more than one million runs from 5,700 ISPs.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing penetration of broadband access technologies, such as DSL, DOCSIS, and WiMAX, provides users with a wide range of upstream and downstream service rates. Broadband users need to know whether they are receiving the service rates they pay for. On the other hand, ISPs now have an extensive toolbox of traffic management mechanisms they can apply to their customers' traffic, including application classifiers, schedulers, and active queue managers. In this paper, we focus on a class of such mechanisms known as traffic shapers or traffic policers.

A traffic shaper is a single-input, single-output packet forwarding module that operates as follows: Consider a link with a capacity of \( C \) bits per second (bps), associated with a "token bucket" of size \( \sigma \) tokens. Whenever the bucket is not full, tokens are generated at a rate of \( \rho \) tokens per second, with \( \rho < C \). The shaper allows packets to be transmitted at the link's peak capacity when tokens are available, but limits the transmission rate to \( \rho \) when the bucket is empty.

In this work, we aim to detect the presence of a level shift in the received rate time series \( R_r(i) \) and estimate the token bucket parameters using \( R_r(i) \).

### 2.1 Detection
Our goal is to detect a level shift in \( R_r \) in real-time, i.e., as we compute the received rate for each new interval. Note that the receiver (RCV) is also receiving new packets during the level-shift detection process, so our method must be fast and computationally lightweight to avoid introducing timestamping jitter. The detection method is simple and relies on nonparametric rank statistics of \( R_r \) to ensure robustness to outliers [15].

We compute ranks online. Suppose we have estimated \( n \) values of \( R_r \) so far. At the start of the new interval \( n + 1 \) (i.e., after the receipt of the first packet in that interval), we compute \( R_r(n) \) and update the ranks \( r(i) \) of \( R_r(i) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \). We identify \( \tau \) as the start of the level shift if it is the first interval index that satisfies the following three conditions:

1. All ranks at the left of \( \tau \) are equal to or higher than all ranks at the right of \( \tau \):
   \[
   \min_{i=1, \ldots, \tau-1} r(i) \geq \max_{j=\tau+1, \ldots, n} r(j)
   \]

This condition ensures that there is a clear and significant change in the rank distribution, indicating a level shift in the received rate time series.
