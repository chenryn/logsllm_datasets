User:  How to ensure the security of the enterprise's internal network and prevent various network attacks?
Assistant: The following are strategies and measures that enterprises can consider to ensure network security and prevent various cyber attacks: 1. Protect network infrastructure. Use technologies such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and intrusion prevention systems to provide basic protection for the network, and install anti-virus software to identify and isolate malware. 2. Ensure the security of network equipment. Restrict unnecessary network access, modify default passwords, and limit the range of IP addresses of devices, etc., and regularly update software to eliminate vulnerabilities. 3. Access control based on roles and permissions. Enable role- and permission-based access control by restricting access, auditing, and monitoring usage of traditional applications such as social media and email. 4. Protect the confidentiality of data. Encryption technology is used to protect the confidentiality of data and ensure that data is not leaked during transmission and storage. 5. Staff training and management. Establish network usage rules and regulations, enforce password policies, audit activity, and review system logs, while continuing to train employees on cybersecurity risks and preventive measures. 6. Protect mobile devices. Set a passcode, remotely lock screen and wipe data, or use mobile device management (MDM) solutions to secure mobile devices. 7. Compliance supervision. Plan and implement appropriate cybersecurity and data privacy compliance checks. Through the implementation of the above measures, enterprises can enhance network security and defense capabilities, and protect their own interests and customer data.
