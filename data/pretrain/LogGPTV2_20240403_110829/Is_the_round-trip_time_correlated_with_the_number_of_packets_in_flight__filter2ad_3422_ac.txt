(i.e., RTT spikes) [13]. To avoid spikes that skew the coef-
ﬁcient of correlation, the correlation between the direction
of changes is considered. The question is: does an increase
(resp. decrease) in the number of packets in ﬂight result in
an increase (resp. decrease) in the roundtrip time? To de-
termine if the statistical correlation between the “direction”
of change (increase or decrease) in the RTT in response to
change in the amount of data in ﬂight is better, four addi-
tional coeﬃcients of correlation related to the direction of
change were measured. Figure 5 presents our results for the
correlation between the direction of variations. For example,
Figure 4.a presents the frequency distribution of the coeﬃ-
cients of correlation between the direction of variations of
RT T (Pi) and W (Pi), i.e., ρv(Cl, Sign(δRT T ), Sign(δW ))
for the population of relevant packets Pi. First, we observe
that the results are quite similar for all populations of pack-
ets, but the curves of Figure 5.b are slightly shifted to the
right: correlation with the population P Wi (one packet per
window) is higher than with the population Pi of all pack-
ets. This conﬁrms that timing all packets is not very helpful.
Second, TCP connections with a high coeﬃcient of correla-
tion (more than 0.80) are rare. This shows clearly that our
results in Figure 4 were somewhat skewed. Finally, observe
that the coeﬃcients of correlations are similar for slow and
fast TCP connections. For both, only 30% of the connec-
tions have a coeﬃcient of correlation larger than 0.4.
4.4 Can ρ Characterize a Path?
Given a path (i.e., route), an interesting question is whether
the coeﬃcients of correlation for all connections along that
path are similar. Figure 6 presents the coeﬃcients of cor-
relation of all connections along all 138 “slow” paths. The
values on x-axis represent the slow paths numbered sequen-
tially from 0 to 137. For each path number, the coeﬃcient of
correlation of all connections on this path is plotted. There
are about 15 to 20 points per path along a vertical line.
The y-axis represents the coeﬃcient of correlation ρW 4 for
packets P Wi (one packet per window). Each point in the
ﬁgure represents the coeﬃcient of correlation for one con-
nection. Observe that, for connections traversing the same
path, the coeﬃcients of correlation span a large interval on
a vertical line. Results for the fast paths are similar and

can be found in [4, 2]. If paths (routes between two sites)
do not change frequently, then the coeﬃcient of correlation
ρW is not a good characteristic of a path because for the
same path, the coeﬃcients of correlation span a large inter-
val. In Figure 7 , similar results are plotted for coeﬃcient
of correlation ρWv(Cl, Sign(δRT T ), Sign(δW )) where only
signs of variations for the packets P Wi are considered.

5. DISCUSSION
Suppose that a car has a special control pedal : the car
accelerates with probability p, and slows down with prob-
ability (1 − p), whenever the control pedal is pushed. The
question is what is the range of values for p which allows the
design of a reliable control system? Intuitively, a value of p
between 0.4 and 0.6 would make it hard to design such a sys-
tem. The design a good congestion avoidance technique un-
der real network conditions must cope with a system under
the control of the special pedal as described above. When
a TCP sender increases its load (push the pedal), the round
trip time may either increase (as one might expect) or it may
also decrease, due to several factors. The most important
factor is that RTT observed by a given TCP connection is
dependent on other traﬃc carried by the network, not just
on the actions of this TCP connection, especially when this
TCP connection consumes a small fraction of the available
bandwidth.. Other possible factors include uncertainty of
interrupt services on the OS at the endpoints, and vagaries
of the transport protocol itself (delayed acknowledgements
for example that can add up to 200ms to the RT T ). The
coeﬃcients of correlation measured conﬁrm that the corre-
lation between RTT and window size is often weak.
To be fair, one may argue that the coeﬃcient of correlation
should be expected to be small (near 0) when there is no
queue build-up. Whenever the TCP sender increases its
load, the round trip time may not increase if there is no
queue build-up. This argument may potentially be valid for
a very high bandwidth bottleneck link. However, it takes
only 4 TCP connections with round trip time 150ms and
ﬁve packets in ﬂight for each to ﬁll up a T1 pipe (with a
1500 bytes segment size). By a similar argument, if the TCP
connection is somehow able to maintain its load below the
available bandwidth, then the correlation coeﬃcients could
be small. Such a situation could occur, for instance, when
the chosen socket buﬀer size is relatively small.
Round-trip time measured by TCP is imprecise and bears
a high random component independent of the actions (in-
creasing or decreasing the load) of the sender. The results
in this paper suggest that, due to such factors, there is no
strong relation between the variations of RT T and the vari-
ations of congestion window size. These results explain the
surprising result of Hengartner et al. [6] about the minor in-
ﬂuence of TCP Vegas’s novel congestion avoidance scheme
on performance.
The measurements of correlation in the directions of change
in RTT and W (e.g., ρv(Cl, Sign(δRT T ), Sign(δW )) ex-
hibit a positive correlation between the signs of variations.
This is specially true for the monitored packets P Wi where
more than 88% of the connections have a positive correla-
tion. This conﬁrms that the network response (i.e., RTT)
is in general somewhat “sensitive” to the load presented by
a TCP connection. However, the correlation is not strong
enough to build “smart” congestion avoidance techniques
which would reliably detect queue build-up using short-
term statistics on round-trip times (RT T ) and/or window
size (W ) unless the TCP ﬂow consumes a large fraction of
the available bandwidth.
