### Title: Reverse Engineering Custom ASICs by Exploiting Potential Supply-Chain Leaks at BlackHat Asia 2019

#### Abstract:
In the realm of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems, many industry-specific solutions rely on custom Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that lack public documentation. These ASICs are often simple System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions, incorporating standardized modules with a few custom functionalities, such as additional CAN-Bus interfaces.

During this presentation, we will delve into the hardware reverse engineering of these custom chips and how to identify vulnerabilities using the Siemens S7-1200 (v1 and v4) series as case studies. Upon disassembling the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), it was evident that all components, except for the main SoC, were off-the-shelf parts. This observation held true for both versions of the Siemens PLCs.

We obtained leaked boards for the MB87M2230 and SIEMENS-A5E30235063 chips from a Chinese online marketplace. Using these boards, we successfully reverse-engineered over 60% of the pins on both chips. We employed an oscilloscope to identify the protocols and voltage levels, and conducted simple resistance measurements to map out the connections between components and determine pin resistances.

Additionally, we identified the interfaces for the flash memories, RAM, and JTAG ports on both chips. The SoC in the older S7-1200v1 series was found to be a Fujitsu ARM-BE chip with the chip ID 0x1406C009. After decapping the chip, we discovered a label indicating it was designed in 2007.

The SoC in the newer S7-1200v4 is an ARM-Cortex-R4 r1p3 operating in big-endian mode. For the S7-1200v4, we established a functional debug setup using a JTAG adapter. This setup allowed us to dump and write memory, set breakpoints, modify the program counter, and utilize other features for live debugging on the Siemens PLC. Given that all S7-1200 devices share the same SoC, it is feasible to enable debugging across the entire series.

This talk will provide insights into the methods and tools used for reverse engineering custom ASICs and highlight the potential security risks associated with supply-chain leaks.
