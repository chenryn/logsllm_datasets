### Figure 11: Acoustic Condition for Air Mass Correction

**Description:**
- **Acoustic Condition (signal InjCrv stNsCharCor):** Used to modify the desired air mass correction `mDesVal1Cor`, which in turn modifies the desired air mass from which the amount of air recirculated is computed.
- **AirCtl numInjChar CA:** A two-dimensional array. The acoustic condition is used to select the appropriate row.
- **Source:** From the EDC17C54 P 874 function sheet. Shading added by the authors.

### Figure 12: NOx Regeneration Release Logic During Homologation Cycle

**Description:**
- **Function Sheet:** EDC17C69 P 1264 for Fiat 500X.
- **Homologation Release Signal:** Requires multiple signals to be asserted, including `stTiCoEngHmlg` (Section IV-D).
- **Engine Running Time:** The homologation release signal is only asserted if the engine running time does not exceed `NSCRgn tiCoEngMaxHmlg C`, set to 1600 seconds in the 55265162 Fiat 500X firmware image.
- **Copyright:** Robert Bosch GmbH.
