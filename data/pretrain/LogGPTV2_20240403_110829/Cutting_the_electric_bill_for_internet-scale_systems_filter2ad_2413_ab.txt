Figure 3: Daily averages of day-ahead peak prices at diﬀerent hubs [18]. The elevation in 2008 correlates with record
high natural gas prices, and does not aﬀect the hydroelectric dominated Northwest. The Northwest consistently
experiences dips near April (this seems to be correlated with seasonal rainfall). Correlated with the global economic
downturn, recent prices in all four locations exhibit a downward trend.

3. EMPIRICAL MARKET ANALYSIS
Figure 4: Comparing price variation in diﬀerent whole-
sale markets, for the New York City hub. The top graph
shows a period when prices were similar across all mar-
kets; the bottom graph shows a period when there was
signiﬁcantly more volatility in the real-time market.
expensive generation units will then need to be activated,
driving up prices. Some markets include an explicit conges-
tion cost component in their prices.
Surprisingly, negative prices can show up for brief periods,
representing conditions where if energy were to be consumed
at a speciﬁc location at a speciﬁc time the overall eﬃciency
of the system would increase.
Market boundaries introduce economic transaction ineﬃ-
ciencies. As we shall see later, even geographically close lo-
cations in diﬀerent markets tend to see uncorrelated prices.
Part of the problem is that diﬀerent markets have evolved
using diﬀerent rules, pricing models, etc.
Clearly, the market for electricity is complex. In addition
to the factors mentioned here, many local idiosyncrasies ex-
ist. In this paper, we use a relatively simple market model
that assumes the following:
1. Real-time prices are known and vary hourly.
2. The electric bill paid by the service operator is propor-
tional to consumption and indexed to wholesale prices.
3. The request routing behavior induced by our method
does not signiﬁcantly alter prices and market behavior.
We posit that imperfectly correlated variations in local
electricity prices can be exploited by operators of large geo-
graphically distributed systems to save money. Rather than
presenting a theoretical discussion, we take an empirical ap-
proach, grounding our analysis in historical market data ag-
gregated from government sources [19, 16], trade publication
archives [18], and public data archives maintained by the dif-
ferent RTOs. We use price data for 30 locations, covering
January 2006 through March 2009.
3.1 Price Variation
Geographic price diﬀerentials are what really matter to
us, but it is useful to ﬁrst get a feel for the behaviour of
individual prices.
Daily Variation. Figure 3 shows daily average prices
for four locations6, from January 2006 through April 2009.
Although prices are relatively stable at long time scales, they
exhibit a signiﬁcant amount of day-to-day volatility, short-
term spikes, seasonal trends, and dependencies on fuel prices
and consumer demand. Some locations in the ﬁgure are
visibly correlated, but hourly prices are not correlated (§3.2).
Diﬀerent Market Types. Spot and futures markets
have diﬀerent price dynamics. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the
diﬀerence for NYC. Compared to the day-ahead market, the
hourly real-time (RT) market is more volatile, with more
high-frequency variation, and a lower average price. The
underlying ﬁve minute RT prices are even more volatile.
The validity of the second assumption depends upon the
extent to which companies hedge their energy costs by con-
tractually locking in ﬁxed pricing (see section 7). A large
6The Northwest is an important region, but lacks an hourly
wholesale market, forcing us to omit the region from the remain-
der of our analysis.

Figure 7: Histograms of hour-to-hour change in real-
time hourly prices for two locations, over the 39-month
period. Both distributions are zero-mean, Gaussian-like,
with very long tails.
For the remainder of this paper, we focus exclusively on
the RT market. Our goal is to exploit geographically uncor-
related volatility, something that is more common in the RT
market. We restrict ourselves to hourly prices, but speculate
that the additional volatility in ﬁve minute prices provides
further opportunities.
Figure 6 provides additional statistics for hourly RT prices.
Hour-to-Hour Volatility. As seen in ﬁgure 4, the hour-
to-hour variation in NYC’s RT prices can be dramatic. Fig-
ure 7 shows the distribution of the hourly change for Palo
Alto and Chicago. At each location, the price per MWh
changed hourly by $20 or more roughly 20% of the time. A
$20 step represents 50% of the mean price for Chicago. Fur-
thermore, the minimum and maximum price during a single
day can easily diﬀer by a factor of 2.
The existence of rapid price ﬂuctuations reﬂects the fact
that short term demand for electricity is far more elastic
than supply. Electricity cannot always be eﬃciently moved
from low demand areas to high demand areas, and producers
cannot always ramp up or down easily.
3.2 Geographic Correlation
Our approach would fail if hourly prices are well correlated
at diﬀerent locations. However, we ﬁnd that locations in
diﬀerent regional markets are never highly correlated, even
when nearby, and that locations in the same region are not
always well correlated.
Figure 8 shows a scatter-plot of pairwise correlation and
geographic distance7. No pairs were negatively correlated.
Note how correlation decreases with distance. Further, note
the impact of RTO market boundaries: most pairs drawn
from the same RTO lie above the 0.6 correlation line, while
all pairs from diﬀerent regions lie below it8. We also see
7We have veriﬁed our results using subsets of the data (e.g. last
12 months), mutual information (Ix,y), shifted signals, etc.
8Ix,y much more clearly divides the data between same-RTO and
diﬀerent-RTO pairs, suggesting that the small overlap in ﬁgure 8
is due to the existence of non-linear relationships within NYISO
