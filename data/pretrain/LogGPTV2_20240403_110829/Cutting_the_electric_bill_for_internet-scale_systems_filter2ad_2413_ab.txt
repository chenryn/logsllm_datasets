### 3. Empirical Market Analysis

#### 3.1 Price Variation

**Geographic Price Differentials:**
The primary focus of our analysis is on geographic price differentials, but it is essential to first understand the behavior of individual prices.

**Daily Variation:**
Figure 3 illustrates the daily average prices for four locations (Portland, OR; Richmond, VA; Houston, TX; and Palo Alto, CA) from January 2006 through April 2009. While prices are relatively stable over long periods, they exhibit significant day-to-day volatility, short-term spikes, seasonal trends, and dependencies on fuel prices and consumer demand. Some locations show visible correlations, but hourly prices are not correlated (see Section 3.2).

**Different Market Types:**
Spot and futures markets have distinct price dynamics. Figures 4 and 5 compare these dynamics for New York City (NYC). The hourly real-time (RT) market is more volatile than the day-ahead market, with higher high-frequency variation and a lower average price. The underlying five-minute RT prices are even more volatile.

**Real-Time Market Statistics:**
Figure 6 provides statistics for hourly RT prices, covering January 2006 through March 2009. The trimmed data (1%) is used for these statistics.

**Hour-to-Hour Volatility:**
As shown in Figure 4, the hour-to-hour variation in NYC's RT prices can be dramatic. Figure 7 presents the distribution of hourly price changes for Palo Alto and Chicago. At each location, the price per MWh changed by $20 or more approximately 20% of the time. A $20 step represents 50% of the mean price for Chicago. Additionally, the minimum and maximum prices within a single day can easily differ by a factor of two.

**Price Fluctuations:**
Rapid price fluctuations reflect the fact that short-term demand for electricity is far more elastic than supply. Electricity cannot always be efficiently moved from low-demand areas to high-demand areas, and producers cannot always ramp up or down easily.

#### 3.2 Geographic Correlation

Our approach relies on the assumption that hourly prices at different locations are not well correlated. We find that locations in different regional markets are never highly correlated, even when geographically close, and that locations within the same region are not always well correlated.

**Correlation and Distance:**
Figure 8 shows a scatter-plot of pairwise correlation and geographic distance. No pairs were negatively correlated. Correlation decreases with distance. The impact of RTO (Regional Transmission Organization) market boundaries is evident: most pairs drawn from the same RTO lie above the 0.6 correlation line, while all pairs from different regions lie below it. We also see that mutual information (Ix,y) more clearly divides the data between same-RTO and different-RTO pairs, suggesting that the small overlap in Figure 8 is due to non-linear relationships within NYISO.

**Price Differences:**
Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the price differences between Palo Alto and Richmond, and Austin and Richmond, respectively. These figures highlight the significant variations in prices across different hubs.

By focusing on the real-time market and exploiting geographically uncorrelated volatility, we aim to identify opportunities for cost savings in large, geographically distributed systems. Our analysis is grounded in historical market data aggregated from government sources, trade publication archives, and public data archives maintained by different RTOs. We use price data for 30 locations, covering January 2006 through March 2009.
