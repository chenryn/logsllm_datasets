When doing functional testing using the test client
(Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Client) and disabling kernel reboots between
requests using `$client->disableReboot()`, upon the 2nd request I'm running
into this:
symfony/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Session/Storage/MockArraySessionStorage.php
Line 134 in 7617492
|  throw new \LogicException('Cannot set session ID after the session has
started.');

I don't have a test case right now, but you should be able to reproduce this
easily.
