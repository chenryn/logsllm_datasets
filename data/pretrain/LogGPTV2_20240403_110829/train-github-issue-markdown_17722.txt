When performing functional testing with the Symfony test client (`Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Client`), and disabling kernel reboots between requests using `$client->disableReboot()`, I encountered the following error on the second request:

```php
// symfony/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Session/Storage/MockArraySessionStorage.php
// Line 134 in 7617492
throw new \LogicException('Cannot set session ID after the session has started.');
```

I do not have a specific test case to share at the moment, but you should be able to reproduce this issue easily.
