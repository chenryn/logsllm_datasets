User: When trying to import the UniCurses package, I receive the error "UniCurses initialization error - pdcurses.dll not found."
I have downloaded the pdcurses distributions (specifically pdc34dllw.zip) and extracted the files to:

*\Python\Lib\site-packages   (Where unicurses.py is located)
*\Python\Lib\site-packages\unicurses
*\Python

None of these have solved the problem.
Assistant: To allow import, pdcurses.dll needs to be located in the python folder, for example C:\python36. To run a python script which imports and executes unicurses modules, the pdcurses.dll needs to be located in the same folder as the python script you are executing, so it needs to be located in 2 places.
