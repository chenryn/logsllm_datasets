User: I've installed the azure SDK for Python (pip install azure).
I've copied the Python code on the MS Azure Machine Learning Batch patch for the ML web-service into an Anaconda Notebook.
I've replaced all the place holders in the script with actual values as noted in the scripts comments.
When I run the script I get the error: "NameError: global name 'BlobService' is not defined" at the script line "blob_service = BlobService(account_name=storage_account_name, account_key=storage_account_key)".
Since the "from azure.storage import *" line at the beginning of the script does not generate an error I'm unclear as to what the problem is and don't know how to fix it.  Can anyone point me to what I should correct?
Assistant: BlobService is function you are trying to call, but it is not defined anywhere. It should be defined when you call from azure.storage import *. It is probably not being called, due to a difference in package versions.
Calling from azure.storage.blob import * should work, as it is now invoked correctly.
