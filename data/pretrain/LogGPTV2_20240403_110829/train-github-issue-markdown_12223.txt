**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
I want to report a bug
**What is the current behavior?**
eslint --fix trying to break my hook)
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**
I have a very simple hook:
    import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
    export function useSwitchTab(trigger, tabsAmount, initialState = 0) {
      const [currentTab, setTab] = useState(initialState - 1)
      useEffect(() => {
        setTab(currentTab + 1 >= tabsAmount ? 0 : currentTab + 1)
      }, [tabsAmount, trigger])
      return [currentTab, setTab]
    }
If props `tabsAmount` or `trigger` will change, I need to increase
`currentTab` value by 1. It works fine and looks ok for me, but in `eslint-
plugin-react-hook` rule `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` will warn here:
> React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'currentTab'. Either include
> it or remove the dependency array. You can also do a functional update
> 'setTab(c => ...)' if you only need 'c  
>  urrentTab' in the 'setTab' call react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
And eslint --fix will break my code like this:
    import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
    export function useSwitchTab(trigger, tabsAmount, initialState = 0) {
      const [currentTab, setTab] = useState(initialState - 1)
      useEffect(() => {
        setTab(currentTab + 1 >= tabsAmount ? 0 : currentTab + 1)
      }, [currentTab, tabsAmount, trigger])
      return [currentTab, setTab]
    }
It will add `currentTab` in deps for useEffect and this will create **endless
loop**.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Eslint shouldn't fix this warning with --fix option, It may break the code.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
react: 16.8.5  
eslint-plugin-react-hooks: 1.6.0
