Hi, I'm new to github and still trying to find my feet. So if this comment is
in the wrong place then please let me know.
I have noticed a change in the mixins.less which causes my code to break. It
seems that there is a mistake (starting at line 388) where the @ and the {
have been swapped around. This happens again in multiple places further down
the file.
The error being returned is "parse error: failed at `{ .span(@index); }`
../less/lib/bootstrap/mixins.less on line 578"
