Hello,

I am currently attempting to build the iOS application as described in [this guide](https://petewarden.com/2016/09/27/tensorflow-for-mobile-poets/). However, I encountered an error during the build process:

```
checking whether we are cross compiling... configure: error:
in '/projects/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/protobuf':
configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs. If you meant to cross
compile, use '--host'.
See `config.log' for more details
```

Here are the system details:

- **Operating System:** macOS Sierra 10.12
- **Brew Configuration:**
