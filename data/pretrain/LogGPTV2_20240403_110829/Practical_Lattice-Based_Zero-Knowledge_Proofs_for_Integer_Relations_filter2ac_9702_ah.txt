The third type is the addition relation X (α2) + (cid:98)X (α0) = (cid:98)X (α1) among L/2t+1-

bit integers. This can be handled using our techniques from Section 4, resulting
in equations modulo 2 with less than 2 · L
2t+1 quadratic terms in total.
The fourth type of relations appears when we reach the base multiplication
27
of 2-bit integers: e.g., Z (α1) = X (α1)Y (α1), where α ∈ {0, 1, 2}k−2. Let X (α1) =
(x(α1)
)2.
This relation can then be expressed by the following equations modulo 2, which
contain 6 quadratic terms.

The other types of relations come into the scene when we add up partial products
and their shifts to compute the Z (α)’s and ﬁnally reach Z, which are reﬂected
by equations (26) and (24). To handle the shifts, e.g., left-shifting integer Z (α1)
by L/2t+1 positions, we assign an auxiliary variable (cid:101)Z (α1) := 2L/2t+1 · Z (α1) and
express the relations between bits of (cid:101)Z (α1) and Z (α1) as linear equations modulo 2,
as is done for the ﬁrst type of relation considered above. After performing all the
shifts, we will need to handle a few additions of integers to compute a partial
product such as Z (α) in (26). There, the subtraction by 2L/2t+1 · (s(α) · Z (α2)) can
be transformed into an equivalent addition relation. Then, we can represent each
of the addition operations in (26) as linear and quadratic equations modulo 2.
Based on the above discussion, it can be seen that the whole execution of the
Karatsuba algorithm can be expressed as linear and quadratic equations modulo 2.
Combining with the linear equation modulo q from 19, we thus obtain an instance
of the general protocol from Section 3.2. As a result, we achieve a statistical
ZKAoK of committed integers X, Y, Z satisfying XY = Z. The security of the
argument system relies on the binding of the COM used in the interaction and
the binding of the commitment variant used for committing to X, Y, Z. Overall,
the protocol is secure assuming the hardness of SIVP(cid:101)O(
L·n).
We remark that, in our process of translating the relations in Section 6.1 into
equations modulo 2, for each type of relations, the number of secret bits and the
number of quadratic terms we need to handle are only a constant times larger than
those before translating. Thus, the ﬁnal numbers N and |T| are of order O(Llog2 3).
Meanwhile, from equation (19), we obtain that m1 + m2 = 4L + 3m. Therefore,
when repeating the protocol κ = ω(log n) times to achieve negligible soundness
error, the total communication cost is of order(cid:0)O(cid:0)L + m) log q(cid:1) +O(Llog2 3)(cid:1)· κ.
√
In terms of computation cost, the total number of bit operations performed by
the prover and the veriﬁer is of order O(Llog2 3), i.e., subquadratic in L.
