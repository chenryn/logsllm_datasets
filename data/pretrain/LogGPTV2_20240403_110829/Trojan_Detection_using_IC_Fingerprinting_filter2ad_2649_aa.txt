Abstract
1. Introduction
Hardware manufacturers are increasingly outsourcing their
IC fabrication work overseas due to their much lower cost
structure. This poses a signiﬁcant security risk for ICs used
for critical military and business applications. Attackers
can exploit this loss of control to substitute Trojan ICs for
genuine ones or insert a Trojan circuit into the design or
mask used for fabrication. We show that a technique bor-
rowed from side-channel cryptanalysis can be used to mit-
igate this problem. Our approach uses noise modeling to
construct a set of ﬁngerprints for an IC family utilizing side-
channel information such as power, temperature, and elec-
tromagnetic (EM) proﬁles. The set of ﬁngerprints can be
developed using a few ICs from a batch and only these ICs
would have to be invasively tested to ensure that they were
all authentic. The remaining ICs are veriﬁed using statisti-
cal tests against the ﬁngerprints. We describe the theoreti-
cal framework and present preliminary experimental results
to show that this approach is viable by presenting results ob-
tained by using power simulations performed on represen-
tative circuits with several different Trojan circuitry. These
results show that Trojans that are 3–4 orders of magnitude
smaller than the main circuit can be detected by signal pro-
cessing techniques. While scaling our technique to detect
even smaller Trojans in complex ICs with tens or hundreds
of millions of transistors would require certain modiﬁca-
tions to the IC design process, our results provide a starting
point to address this important problem.

1.1. Problem Statement
Economic and market forces have driven most hard-
ware manufacturers to outsource their IC fabrication to ever
cheaper fabrication facilities abroad. As a result, the ma-
jority of the ICs available today are being manufactured at
fabrication facilities in low-cost countries around the globe.
While outsourcing of IC fabrication reduces the cost sig-
niﬁcantly, it also makes it much easier for an attacker to
compromise the IC supply chain for sensitive commercial
and defense applications. For example, the attacker could
substitute Trojan ICs for genuine ICs during transit or sub-
vert the fabrication process itself by implanting additional
Trojan circuitry into the IC mask.
Such Trojans could be designed to be hard (or nearly
impossible) to detect by purely functional testing, yet be
capable of inﬂicting catastrophic damage. For example, a
Trojan circuit could be designed so that it monitors for a
speciﬁc but rare trigger condition, e.g., a speciﬁc bit pat-
tern in received data packet or on a bus, or until a timer
reaches a particular value. Once triggered the Trojan could
take actions such as disabling the circuit, leaking secrets or
creating glitches to compromise the integrity and security
of the larger system to which the IC belongs. For example,
a simple yet destructive Trojan in an RSA [24] circuit could
wait for a trigger condition and then insert a fault in the CRT
inversion step of an RSA signature computation leading to
the compromise of the RSA key [6].
While this threat to the integrity of the IC supply is al-
ready a cause for alarm within defense circles in some coun-
tries [19, 9, 1], we believe that it should also be a cause for
concern for vendors and consumers of commercial grade
cryptographic and security critical hardware. Compound-
ing this problem is the fact that currently there are no good,
long-term solutions to this problem. While individual ICs

delity to the original design, this does not guarantee that
ICs not subjected to such testing are free of Trojans. For
this reason, some governments have been subsidizing the
operations of a few local, high-cost and economically unvi-
able “trusted” fabrication plants for manufacturing military
ICs. However most developing countries and commercial
vendors cannot afford this expensive option. Another op-
tion suggested in [9] is camouﬂaging or obfuscation, where
some critical IC designs are requested to be manufactured
along with several non-critical ICs, or the true function of
an IC is buried in confusing logic. However, this will not
deter a motivated attacker who is willing to spend some
effort in determining whether or not a critical IC is being
manufactured, and subsequently in subverting the design.
Apart from a few special cases, general circuit obfuscation
has been shown to be impossible to achieve [4, 29, 14].
Secondly, an attacker may be able to implant a destructive
Trojan without having to understand the details of its op-
eration. For example, in the RSA Fault injection Trojan
example given above, almost any disruption to one of the
CRT exponentiations will do. We note here that once IC
manufacturing is secured, subsequent risk of IC substitu-
tion in the supply-chain could be mitigated using existing
techniques. For example, security critical chips could be
designed so that an on-chip key gets created e.g, by using a
silicon physically random, uncloneable functions [12], gets
certiﬁed upon manufacture and subsequently protected us-
ing anti-tamper countermeasures.
1.2. Trojan Detection: A New Technique
While completely eliminating the threat posed by a com-
promised IC supply chain appears to be a daunting “grand
challenge”, in this paper, we propose a novel side-channel
based approach that can be used for detecting the presence
of Trojan circuitry in ICs that are practically impossible to
detect using purely functional testing since they would be
activated by a trigger condition such as a match between the
signal on a bus or register and a certain bit pattern which
would occur with very low probability during functional
testing. Our technique requires just a few ICs to be destruc-
tively tested while permitting the rest of the ICs to be non-
destructive validated using side-channel analysis for the ab-
sence of any signiﬁcantly-sized (3–4 orders of magnitude
smaller) Trojans. We believe that our technique would be
part of any comprehensive approach that would be devel-
oped to deal with this threat.
Several side channels [16, 17, 22, 11, 3] and side-channel
analysis techniques have emerged over the past decade and
have proved to be highly effective in extracting informa-
tion about the internal operations of embedded devices from
their timing, power consumption and electromagnetic (EM)
emanation proﬁles. Typically, an attacker tries to deduce
critical information such as the encryption key using the
leakage from these side-channels. An important aspect of
side channel attack techniques is that these techniques are
effective even though the information present within the
side-channels could be masked by various types of noise,
including measurement noise, ambient noise, and other ran-
dom signal variations that manifest themselves during the
circuit operation. While the initial attack techniques such
as Differential Power/EM Analysis dealt with the problem
of noise by averaging it out over multiple samples, later
work on template attacks and its variants [7, 23] actually
build statistical models for the noise and used them to clas-
sify individual noisy signals. In particular, these attacks use
noise models built from one IC to attack another IC from
the same mask. The success reported with these techniques
provided the initial motivation to pursue side-channel anal-
ysis to detect Trojans ICs—the problem of Trojan detection
essentially reduces to detecting a Trojan signal hiding in the
IC process noise, i.e., the small, random, physical and side-
channel differences among different ICs produced from the
same process.
In this paper, we propose the following side-channel
based ﬁngerprinting methodology for detecting Trojan ICs.
This initial approach does not require any changes to cur-
rent processes and practices regarding the design and fabri-
cation of ICs, and in particular, it does not require trusted
fabs. However, it does require an additional IC ﬁngerprint
generation and validation step to be carried out by a trust-
worthy IC testing facility to gain assurance that the chances
of Trojans being present in the validated ICs have been sig-
niﬁcantly lowered. The same testing strategy could even be
used to increase the assurance of ICs manufactured from a
trusted fab. The ﬁngerprinting methodology consists of the
following steps:
1. Select a few ICs at random from a family of ICs (i.e.,
ICs with the same mask and manufactured in the same
fab).
2. Run sufﬁcient I/O tests multiple times on the selected
ICs so as to exercise all of their expected circuitry and
collect one or more side-channel signals (power, EM,
thermal emissions etc.) from the ICs during these tests.
3. Use these side-channel signals to build a “side-channel
ﬁngerprint” for the IC family.
4. Destructively test the selected ICs to validate that they
are compliant to the original speciﬁcations.
5. All other
ICs from the same family are non-
destructively validated by subjecting them to the same
I/O tests and validating that their side-channel signals
are consistent with the “side-channel ﬁngerprint” of
the family.

non-redundant set of tests that provide sufﬁcient coverage
of the IC’s functionality. It is critical that the overall behav-
ior of the IC in both the data and control paths is captured
during these tests. In the third step, building the ﬁngerprint
requires characterizing the signal(s) and noise on different
side-channels for the IC family for different inputs. The
challenge here is to develop a characterization which is as
comprehensive as possible without being impractical, and
which is capable of distinguishing most Trojans from gen-
uine ICs. We will provide details on this ﬁngerprint gener-
ation in Section 3. The fourth step could utilize techniques
such as demasking, delayering and layer-by-layer compar-
ison of X-ray scans with the original mask. This step is
likely to be expensive, but since it is only done for a few
selected ICs from an entire family, the cost when amortized
over all the ICs that are tested from that family may still be
acceptable. Also, the ﬁfth step should only be carried out
if the destructive tests in the fourth step do not identify any
problems with the ICs used to build the ﬁngerprint.
We note that there has been some related work on using
side-channels for testing and trapdoor detection. For exam-
ple, power supply current proﬁle monitoring is a common
technique in testing ICs and identifying (non-adversarial)
defects [15, 5, 13]. Lee, Jung and Lim [18] propose to
use timing and power analysis techniques to detect hidden
trapdoors in smartcards. Speciﬁcally, they consider power
analysis to identify undisclosed instructions built into the
system by the manufacturer for reprogramming (and recy-
cling) wrongly issued smartcards. These works however do
not address the problem of Trojan detection.
In this work, we will use power signals as the side
channel and analyze the effectiveness of our ﬁngerprinting
methodology for detecting Trojans by using power simula-
tions from sample cryptographic circuits implementing the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [2] and RSA algo-
rithm [24] and different types and sizes of Trojans, includ-
ing Trojans triggered by timing/clock counting and Trojans
triggered by a synchronous/asynchronous comparator, with
sizes ranging from 10% to0. 01% of the total IC size and
for different levels of noise introduced by process variations
(+/- 2%, 5%, 7.5%).
We would like to note that while it may be theoretically
possible for an adversary to hide a Trojan from our tests by
ensuring that its signal is so similar to process noise that
it cannot be distinguished from it, this is likely to be ex-
tremely difﬁcult and costly to accomplish. Firstly the ad-
versary does not know what tests, side channels and local-
ization techniques will be used for testing and cannot easily
predict the process dependent noise that will be introduced
in these channels. Channels such as EM are very hard to
model and the adversary would have to resort to trial and
error involving manufacturing actual ICs and testing them
using a variety of tests and side-channels to make sure that
these do not reveal the Trojans’s presence. This should be
contrasted with the ease with which one can put in a Trojan
circuit that is hidden from functional testing.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we discuss the impact that Trojans have on the power
side-channel and some simple tests that can be used to de-
tect a large class of Trojans. In Section 3, we present the
theoretical framework for detecting Trojans, describe ad-
vanced techniques that can be used in the presence of over-
whelming process noise, and present our results in this set-
ting. Section 4 describes the architecture for the circuits
and Trojans used in our experiments and the setup used to
perform our simulations. In Section 5 we present our exper-
imental results. Finally, in Section 6 we present our conclu-
sions and future work.
2. Trojans and their Side-channel Leakage
There are several types of Trojan circuits that could in-
fest ICs, however most Trojan circuits share some behav-
ioral characteristics that make them useful for the attacker.
All Trojan circuits need to be stealthy, i.e., hard to detect
either from the physical appearance of the IC or during its
testing and normal use. This means that the Trojan IC has
to have the same physical form-factor, pin-out and very sim-
ilar input/output behavior, i.e., for most inputs, the output
of an IC with a Trojan circuit should be indistinguishable
from the output of a genuine IC. In particular, if the out-
put is a deterministic function of the input, then the Trojan
IC has to output the same function for most inputs1. For
a deterministic circuit, this essentially means that the Tro-
jan circuit needs to monitor inputs, intermediate results, or
some clock/time circuitry and wait for a trigger condition
before altering the output behavior either by producing in-
correct results or by causing other failures. The trigger con-
dition has to occur with very low probability during testing
or normal usage, but could be invoked more frequently by
the attacker. The trigger condition may also be chosen to oc-
cur after a certain time has elapsed. For non-deterministic
circuits, e.g., those involving the use of IC generated ran-
domness, the Trojan circuit could more easily encode in-
formation in the output without detection but still needs to
be very selective (possibly trigger based) in producing de-
tectably incorrect results or causing failure.
From the perspective of an attacker, it is fairly easy to
manufacture elaborate complex Trojan ICs that look like
the genuine ICs and have similar input/output behavior dur-
ing testing and normal use. Modern IC manufacturing tech-
niques leave a lot of room for inserting large, complex Tro-
jan circuitry within the main circuit without impacting die
1This study did not consider analog Trojan ICs which get activated,
operated, or communicated to from the outside by means of analog signals.

to identify and implement. In Section 3, we will show that
by using side-channel ﬁngerprints, it is not too difﬁcult to
identify the presence of a Trojan. But ﬁrst we will mention
much simpler methods for detecting Trojans.
2.1. Trojan Detection via Simple Side-
channel Analysis
Even simple side-channel analysis can detect many types
of Trojan circuits. For example, a Trojan IC whose timing
is different for test inputs will get detected by timing anal-
ysis, or a Trojan IC which demonstrates a signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent behavior compared to a genuine IC at any time dur-
ing the entire computation on the test data will get detected
using a Simple Power Analysis (SPA)/Simple Electromag-
netic Analysis (SEMA) [22, 11, 3] like technique on a single
power/EM trace.

Another example of Trojan ICs that can be detected by
simple side-channel analysis are the ICs that have a rela-
tively large Trojan circuitry even if the circuitry remains
mostly inactive on the test data. This is because of the
fact that the total power consumption in a digital circuit
comprises the dynamic power consumption and the leak-
age power consumption whose individual contributions are
given by the following equation [8]:

where C, Qse and VDD are technology dependent parame-
ters, N represents the switching activity and f is the clock
frequency. Note here that the leakage current, Ileak, de-
pends only on the number of gates in the circuit and the
fabrication technology. Since the dynamic power is linearly
dependent on the clock frequency and the switching activ-
ity, and the leakage power depends only on the circuit area,
one can discover a large Trojan circuit simply by running
the ICs at a very low clock frequency. For example, Fig-
ure 1 shows the details of the power signals from a non-
Trojan AES [2] circuit (green or grey) with an equivalent
area of 4302 2-input NAND gates and a Trojan AES circuit
(blue or black) with a 10-bit counter as the Trojan which
has an equivalent area of 247 2-input NAND gates. On the
left the circuit is clocked at 100 MHz and sampled at 1 ns
intervals and on the right the circuit is clocked at 500 KHz
and sampled at 200 ns intervals. The Trojan in this case is
roughly 5.6% of the total circuit size. At 100 MHz it is dif-
ﬁcult to distinguish between the baseline power consump-
tion of the Trojan and non-Trojan ICs, however, the differ-
ence between their baseline power consumption is obvious
at 500 KHz. We would like to note that the functionality of
a dynamic circuit depends on a minimum clock frequency
which is required to refresh the storage nodes. This may be
a limitation for testing a circuit at extremely low clock fre-
quencies (below the minimum available clock frequency)
unless one utilizes special design techniques for refreshing
the storage nodes.
In fact the only types of Trojan ICs that can survive the
simple side-channel tests described above are those which
contain a small Trojan circuit and perform computations es-
sentially very similar to that done by the genuine IC to pro-
duce the expected results and to maintain the side channel
signal shape on test inputs. The additional computation on
the test data performed by such Trojan ICs may be relatively
simple such as testing for a trigger condition, monitoring or
