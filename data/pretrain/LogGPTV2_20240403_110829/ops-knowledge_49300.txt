User: I'm reading text in terminal with
description = raw_input()
It works if I write the text and press enter. The problem is when I paste the text from somewhere with Ctrl+Shift+V or with right click + paste. My program immediately ends, description contains only part of the text (I can see it in database).
Do you know how to do this so paste works? I'm using xfce4-terminal in Ubuntu.
thank you
Assistant: Make sure that your pasted text doesn't contain any embedded control characters (such as a newline), which could end the input.
