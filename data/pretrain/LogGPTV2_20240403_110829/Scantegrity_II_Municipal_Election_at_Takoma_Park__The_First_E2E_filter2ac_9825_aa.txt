Abstract
On November 3, 2009, voters in Takoma Park, Mary-
land, cast ballots for the mayor and city council members
using the Scantegrity II voting system—the ﬁrst time
any end-to-end (E2E) voting system with ballot privacy
has been used in a binding governmental election. This
case study describes the various efforts that went into
the election—including the improved design and imple-
mentation of the voting system, streamlined procedures,
agreements with the city, and assessments of the experi-
ences of voters and poll workers.
The election, with 1728 voters from six wards, in-
volved paper ballots with invisible-ink conﬁrmation
codes, instant-runoff voting with write-ins, early and
absentee (mail-in) voting, dual-language ballots, provi-
sional ballots, privacy sleeves, any-which-way scanning
with parallel conventional desktop scanners, end-to-end
veriﬁability based on optional web-based voter veriﬁca-
tion of votes cast, a full hand recount, thresholded author-
ities, three independent outside auditors, fully-disclosed
software, and exit surveys for voters and pollworkers.
Despite some glitches, the use of Scantegrity II was
a success, demonstrating that E2E cryptographic voting
systems can be effectively used and accepted by the gen-
eral public.

Introduction
The November 2009 municipal election of the city of
Takoma Park, Maryland marked the ﬁrst time that any-
one could verify that the votes were counted correctly in
a secret ballot election for public ofﬁce without having
to be present for the entire proceedings. This article is a
case study of the Takoma Park election, describing what
was done—from the time the Scantegrity Voting Sys-
tem Team (SVST) was approached by the Takoma Park
Board of Elections in February 2008, to the last crypto-
graphic election audit in December 2009—and what was
learned. While the paper provides a simple summary of
survey results, the focus of this paper is not usability but
the engineering process of bringing a new cryptographic
approach to solve a complex practical problem involving
technology, procedures, and laws.
With the Scantegrity II voting system, voters mark op-
tical scan paper ballots with pens, ﬁlling the oval for
the candidates of their choice. These ballots are handled
as traditional ballots, permitting all the usual automated
and manual counting, accounting, and recounting. Ad-
ditionally, the voting system provides a layer of integrity
protection through its use of invisible-ink conﬁrmation
codes. When voters mark ballot ovals using a decoder
pen, conﬁrmation codes printed in invisible ink are re-
vealed. Interested voters can note down these codes to
check them later on the election website. The codes are
generated randomly for each race and each ballot, and
hence do not reveal the corresponding vote. A ﬁnal tally
can be computed from the codes and the system provides
a public digital audit trail of the computation.
Election audits in Scantegrity II are not restricted to
privileged individuals and can be performed by voters
and other interested parties. Developers and election au-
thorities are unable to signiﬁcantly falsify an election
outcome without an overwhelming probability of an au-
dit failure [8]. The other side of the issue of integrity,
also solved by the system, is that false claims of impro-
priety in the recording and tally of the votes are readily
revealed to be false. 1
All the software used in the election—for ballot au-
thoring, printing, scanning and tally—was published
well in advance of the election as commented, buildable
source code, which may be a ﬁrst in its own right. More-
over, commercial off-the-shelf scanners were adapted to
receive ballots in privacy sleeves from voters, making the

ballot systems is that additional marks could be added to ballots by
those with special access. Such attacks are made more difﬁcult by
Scantegrity II.

overall system relatively inexpensive.
Despite several limitations of the implementation, we
found that the amount of extra work needed by ofﬁcials
to use Scantegrity II while administering an election is
acceptable given the promise of improved voter satisfac-
tion and indisputability of the outcome. Indeed, discus-
sions are ongoing with the Board of Elections of the city
regarding continued use of the system in future elections.
Another observation from the election is that the elec-
tion ofﬁcials and voters surveyed seemed to appreciate
the system. Since voters who do not wish to verify can
simply proceed as usual, ignoring the codes revealed in
the ﬁlled ovals, the system is least intrusive for these vot-
ers. Those voters who did check their codes, and even
many who did not, seem to appreciate the opportunity.
This paper describes the entire process of adapting the
Scantegrity II system to handle the Takoma Park elec-
tion, including the agreement with the city, printing the
special ballots with invisible-ink conﬁrmation codes, ac-
tually running the election, and verifying that the election
outcome was correct.
Organization of this case study The next section pro-
vides an overview of related work in this area, summa-
rizing previous experiments with Scantegrity II and other
E2E systems in practical settings.
Section 3 describes in more detail the setting for the
election: giving details about Takoma Park and their
election requirements. Section 4 gives more details of
the Scantegrity II voting system, including a description
of how one can “audit” an election. Section 5 provides
an overview of the implementation of the voting system
for the November 3, 2009 Takoma Park municipal elec-
tion, including the scanner software, the cryptographic
back-end, and the random-number generation routines.
Section 6 gives a chronological presentation and time-
line of the steps taken to run the November election,
including the outcome of the voter veriﬁcation and the
audits.
It also gives the results of the election, with
some performance and integrity metrics. Section 7 re-
ports some results of the exit surveys taken of voters and
pollworkers.
Section 8 discusses the high-level lessons learned from
this election. Section 9 provides some conclusions, ac-
knowledgements, and disclosures required by the pro-
gram committee.
2 Related Work
Chaum was the ﬁrst to propose the use of cryptogra-
phy for the purpose of secure elections [5]. This was
followed by almost two decades of work in improving
security and privacy guarantees (for a nice survey, see
Adida [1]), most recently under the rubric of end-to-end
voting systems. These voting system proposals provide
integrity (any attempt to change the tally can be caught
with very high probability by audits which are not re-
stricted to privileged individuals) and ballot secrecy.
The ﬁrst of these proposals include protocols by
Chaum [6] and Neff [19], which were implemented soon
after (Chaum’s as Citizen-Veriﬁed Voting [16] and Neff’s
by VoteHere). Several more proposals with prototypes
followed: Prˆet `a Voter [10], Punchscan [21, 15], the pro-
posal of Kutylowski and Zag´orski [18] as Voting Ducks,
and Simple Veriﬁable Voting [4] as Helios [2] and Vote-
Box [24].
Making end-to-end systems usable in real elections
has proven to be challenging. We are aware of the follow-
ing previous binding elections held using similar veriﬁ-
cation technology: the Punchscan elections for the grad-
uate students’ union of the University of Ottawa (2007)
and the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibil-
ity (2007); the Rijnland Internet Election System (RIES)
public elections in the Netherlands in 2004 and 2006; the
Helios elections of the Recteur of Universit´e Catholique
de Louvain [3] (2009) and the Princeton undergraduate
student government election (2009), as well as a student
election using Prˆet `a Voter.
Only the RIES system has been used in a governmen-
tal election; however, it is meant for remote (absentee)
voting and, consequently, does not offer strong ballot se-
crecy guarantees. For this reason, it has been recom-
mended that the RIES system not be used for regular
public elections [17, 20]. Helios is also a remote vot-
ing system, and offers stronger ballot secrecy guarantees
over RIES. The Punchscan elections were the closest to
this study, but they did not rise to the level of public
elections. They did not have multiple ballot styles, the
users of the system were not a broad cross-segment of
the population as in Takoma Park, the system implemen-
tors were deeply involved in administering the elections,
and no active auditors were established to audit the elec-
tions. To date, this study is the most comparable use case
of E2E technology to that of a typical optical scan elec-
tion.
The case study reported here is based on a series of
systems successively developed, tested, and deployed by
a team of researchers included among the present au-
thors originating with the Punchscan system. Although
it used paper ballots, the Punchscan system did not al-
low manual recounts, a feature that the team recognized
as needing to be designed into the next generation of
systems. The result was Scantegrity [9], which retained
hand-countable ballots, and was tested in a number of
small elections. With Scantegrity, however, it was too
easy to trigger an audit that would require scrutiny of the
physical ballots. The Scantegrity II system [7, 8], de-
2
ployed in Takoma Park, was a further reﬁnement to ad-
dress this problem by allowing a public statistical test of
whether voter complaints actually reﬂect a discrepancy
or whether they are without basis. Note: in the rest of
the paper, “Scantegrity” refers to the voting team or to
the Scantegrity II voting system; which one is typically
easily determined from context.
As part of the Scantegrity agreement with Takoma
Park (see section 3), a “mock election” [26] was held
in April 2009 to test and demonstrate feasibility of the
Scantegrity system during Takoma Park’s annual Arbor
day celebration. Volunteer voters voted for their favorite
tree. A number of revisions and tweaks to the Scant-
egrity system were made as a result of the mock elec-
tion, including: ballot revisions (no detachable chit, but
instead a separate voter veriﬁcation card), pen revisions
(two-ended, with different sized tips), scanner station re-
visions (better voter ﬂow, no monitor, two scanners), pri-
vacy sleeve (no lock, no clipboard, folding design, feeds
directly into scanner), and conﬁrmation codes (three dec-
imal digits).
3 The Setting
For several reasons, the implementation of voting sys-
tems is a difﬁcult task. Most voting system users—
i.e. the voters—are untrained and elections happen infre-
quently. Voter privacy requirements preclude the usual
sorts of feedback and auditing methods common in other
applications, such as banking. Also, government regula-
tions and pre-existing norms in the conduct of elections
are difﬁcult to change. These issues can pose signiﬁcant
challenges when deploying new voting systems, and it
is therefore useful to understand the setting in which the
election took place.
About Takoma Park The city of Takoma Park is lo-
cated in Montogomery County, Maryland, shares a city
line with Washington, D.C, and is governed by a mayor
and a six-member City Council. The city has about
17,000 residents2 and almost 11,000 registered voters
[27, pg. 10]. A seven-member Board of Elections con-
ducts local elections in collaboration with the City Clerk.
In the past, the city has used hand counts and optical scan
voting, as well as DREs for state elections.
The Montgomery County US Census Update Data
of 2005 provides some demographic information about
the city. Median household income in 2004 was
$48,675. The percentage of households with comput-
ers was 87.4%, and about 32% of Takoma Park residents
above the age of twenty-ﬁve had a graduate, professional
or doctoral degree. It is an ethnically diverse city: 45.8%
2See http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/about.html.
of its residents identify their race as “White,” 36.3% as
“Black,” 9.7% as “Asian or Paciﬁc Islander” and 8.2% as
“Other” (individuals of Hispanic origin form the major
component of this category). Further, 44.4% of its house-
holds have a foreign-born head of household or spouse,
and 44.8% of residents above the age of ﬁve spoke a lan-
guage other than English at home.
Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) Takoma Park has used
IRV in municipal city elections since 2006.
IRV is a
ranked choice system where each voter assigns each can-
didate a rank according to her preferences. The rules3
used by Takoma Park (and the Scantegrity software) for
counting IRV ballots are relatively standard, so we omit
further discussion for lack of space.
Agreement with the City As with any municipal gov-
ernment in the US, Takoma Park is allowed to choose its
own voting system for city elections. For county, state,
and federal elections, it is constrained by county, state,
and federal election laws.
Takoma Park and the SVST signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU), in which the SVST agreed
to provide equipment, software, training assistance, and
technical support. The City of Takoma Park agreed to
provide election-related information on the municipality,
election workers, consumable materials, and perform or
provide all other election duties or materials not provided
by us. No goods or funds were exchanged.
According to the MOU, if approved by the city coun-
cil, the election was to be conducted in compliance with
all applicable laws and policies of the city. This included
using Instant Runoff Voting as deﬁned by the City of
Takoma Park Municipal Charter.
The SVST also agreed to pursue an accessible ballot-
marking device for the election, but was later relieved of
satisfying this requirement. Unfortunately, Scantegrity
is not yet ﬁtted with a voter interface for those with vi-
sual or motor disabilities, and accessible user interfaces
were also not used in Takoma Park’s previous optical
scan elections.
