History of 
Vulnerability 
Disclosure 
and Bug 
Bounty 
Programs 
Vulnerability Disclosure vs. Bug Bounty Programs 
 Vulnerability Disclosure 
Ensures that organizations are ready to handle vulnerability reports. 
Follows the ISO standards for vulnerability disclosure (ISO 29147) and 
vulnerability handling processes (ISO 30111). 
94% of the Forbes 2000 companies don’t have this in place 
Bug Bounty Programs 
Some organizations and governments choose to offer cash rewards for bugs.  
Some do it alone (e.g. Microsoft), while the majority choose a bug bounty 
service provider to help. 
Bug Bounties can work in large and small organizations, with some prep & 
help

Great if you need triage 
support, less so if you 
don’t want triage outside 
your company’s eyes only 
Great if you want 
automation for your own 
vulnerability handling, 
less so if you lack the 
internal talent to use it 
Great if you want a 
crowd-sourced 
penetration test under 
NDA, less so if you need a 
broader pool of eyes

Coming in 2017: A Wave of Bug Bounties 
Avoid these pitfalls, in Planning Bounties & Marathons 
“Failing to plan is planning to fail.” 
“Don’t reinvent the wheel, just realign it.” 
Rushing into a bug bounty without preparation is like running a marathon 
immediately following a coma. 
You’re not a snowflake. Except that you are. Except that you’re not 
when it comes to vulnerability disclosure.

Policy: I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means 
• Not pronounced 
“police-y” 
• I’m not a lobbyist, not a 
lawyer, though the 
activities are related 
• I help advise lawmakers, 
regulators, governments

Wassenaar? Gesundheit! 
•
41 countries trying to control weapons proliferation 
•
December 2013: Added “intrusion software” and “intrusion software 
technology” to the list of controlled weapons 
•
May 2015: US proposed a draft implementation of the export control 
rule to comply with Wassenaar 
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE! 
INTENT vs RESULT: 
•
Meant to regulate surveillance software, keeping it from being sold to 
repressive regimes who would use it to abuse human rights (Sudan, 
Syria, etc) 
•
Ends up catching all kinds of software and technology that is useful for 
defense

Vulnerability 
Coordination 
Maturity Model 
Where to begin 
Where to go 
Vulnerability Coordination Maturity Model 
 Model guides how to organize and improve 
vulnerability disclosure processes 
 5 Capability Areas: Organizational, 
Engineering, Communications, Analytics 
and Incentives  
 3 Maturity Levels for each Capability: 
Basic, Advanced or Expert  
 Organizations can benchmark their 
capabilities  
Analytics
Communications
Engineering
Incentives
Organizational
Organizational 
Organizational  
People, process, and resources to handle potential vulnerabilities 
Level --Capability  
Basic 
Executive support to respond to vulnerability reports and a commitment to 
security and quality as core organizational values.  
Advanced 
Policy and process for addressing vulnerabilities according to ISO 29147 and 
ISO 30111, or a comparable framework.  
Expert 
You have executive support, processes, budget and dedicated personnel for 
handling vulnerability reports.  
Engineering 
Engineering: 
Capabilities to evaluate and remediate security holes, and improve software development 
lifecycle 
Level -- Capability  
Basic 
Clear way to receive vulnerability reports, and an internal bug database to 
track them to resolution. See ISO 29147. 
Advanced 
Dedicated security bug tracking and documentation of security decisions, 
deferrals, and trade-offs.  
Expert 
Use vulnerability trends and root cause analysis to eliminate entire classes of 
vulnerabilities. See ISOs 29147, 30111, 27034.  
Communication 
Communications  
Ability to communicate to audiences internally and  
externally about vulnerabilities.  
Level - Capability  
Basic 
Ability to receive vulnerability reports and a verifiable channel to distribute 
advisories to affected parties. See ISO 29147.  
Advanced 
Tailored, repeatable communications for each audience, including security 
researchers, partners, customers, and media.  
Expert 
Structured information sharing programs with coordinated distribution of 
remediation.  
Analytics 
Analytics 
Data analysis of vulnerabilities to identify  
trends and improve processes. 
Level - Capability  
Basic 
Track the number and severity of vulnerabilities over time to measure 
improvements in code quality.  
Advanced 
Use root causes analysis to feed back into your software development lifecycle. 
See ISOs 29147, 30111, 27034.  
Expert 
Track real-time telemetry of active exploitation to drive dynamic pivots of 
remediation strategy.  
Incentives 
Incentives 
Ability to encourage security researchers  
to report vulnerabilities directly. 
Level - Capability  
Basic 
Show thanks or give swag. Clearly state that no legal action will be taken 
against researchers who report bugs.  
Advanced 
Give financial rewards or bug bounties to encourage reporting the most 
serious vulnerabilities.  
Expert 
Understand adversary behavior and vulnerability markets, and structure 
advanced incentives to disrupt them.  
Someone Will 
Disclose a Bug  
to You  
or breach you. 
Not if. When. 
Proactive Steps 
1.
Take the Vulnerability Coordination Maturity Model Assessment today to assess your 
capabilities 
2.
Ask for help from those who have come before to develop your strategic and tactical 
plan for the inevitable vulnerability report 
3.
Consider your goals if seeking a bug bounty or any other security service provider 
4.
Vulnerability Disclosure is among your first steps, master that, and practice the 
EMPATHY that security requires. 
5.
Build Security In whenever you can, but know that you will not be able to catch 
everything 
Bug Bounties don’t need to spill blood in the water.  
Bug Bounties won’t replace other security testing. 
Hackers can help you – if you let them! 
Change is the only constant EVOLVE 
Where Will Your Security Story Take You?
