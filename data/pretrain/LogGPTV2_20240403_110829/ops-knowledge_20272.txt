User: I have downloaded and unzip the cabot(python tool) in my linux system.But then I don't know how to install it.In the cabot folder there is setup.sh file. But when I put build or install it is not working.So What to do?
Assistant: It's an ".sh" file right?
Then to run the same what you have to do is :-
1)Open Terminal
2)Change directory to file location
3) run the following command.
        sh setup.sh
