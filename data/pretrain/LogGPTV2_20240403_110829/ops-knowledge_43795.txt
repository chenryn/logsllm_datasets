Question: Why is it necessary to rely on higher layers of the networking model to ensure the reliability and security of communications over the internet, despite the functionality provided by the physical, link, and internetwork layers? Select all that apply.
"A": "The lower layers do not maintain a concept of a connection, which is required for two-way communication.",
"B": "Layer 3 IP protocol only offers best-effort delivery and does not handle errors or offer any security guarantees.",
"C": "The lower layers provide sufficient security through intrinsic routing mechanisms and do not require additional protocols.",
"D": "Higher layers can break up longer messages into packets and implement cryptographic protocols."
