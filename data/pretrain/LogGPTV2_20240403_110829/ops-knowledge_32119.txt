User: I'm using Python (winappdbg) to monitor a process (the main feature is to catch the exceptions).
But I would like also to detect infinite loops.
Do you know a way to do that with Python?
With or without winappdbg ...
Assistant: Infinite loops usually consume 100% CPU while well-behaving programs don't, so the first thing I'd do is check CPU usage. Unfortunately, this won't let you identify where the infinite loop is in your code.
To do that, you could use a profiler to record the number of times the code is being executed. If you find a really huge number of executions in an unexpected region, then it's worth at least investigating it.
Edit: As pointed out by mac, monitor CPU usage won't be useful for CPU intensive tasks, so it's not something that can be applied in all cases.
