User: I saw a couple of tutorials and they all make use of termial/command-prompt and I just dont know how they work. Is it necessary to know how they work before learning python or you can just earn it like you would learn some other language(lets say C)
It'll be great if you could recommend something. 
NOTE: I am a windows user.
Assistant: No.  If you know how to open the command prompt, navigate to a directory ("cd") and list a directory ("dir" on windows and "ls" on linux), then you can probably jump right into those python tutorials.
