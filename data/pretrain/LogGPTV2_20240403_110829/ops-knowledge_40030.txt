**User:**
I want to use all the data stored in my Python App Engine Memcache. However, I do not know the keys in advance. How can I retrieve all the data from the Memcache?

**Assistant:**
As mentioned in the comments above, one approach could be to store all the data in a single Memcache entry with a known key. This method is particularly useful for static data. However, for non-static data, there are still scenarios where it would be beneficial to have a way to retrieve all the data without knowing the keys in advance.
