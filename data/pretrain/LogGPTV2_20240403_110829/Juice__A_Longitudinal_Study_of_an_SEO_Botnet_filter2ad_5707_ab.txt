### Fake Anti-Virus and Malware: Monetization for Botmasters

Botmasters can generate revenue through various malicious activities, including the distribution of fake anti-virus software and malware. The SEO kit facilitates this by returning a target URL along with redirect JavaScript code as an HTTP response, which automatically directs the user's browser to the target site. Additionally, the SEO kit employs a cloaking mechanism to provide backdoor access to the compromised site for the botmaster. This backdoor is authenticated by inspecting the User-Agent field in the HTTP request headers for a specific, unique phrase. Once authenticated, the botmaster can read files from the local hard disk, use the compromised site as a proxy, fetch URLs, and run scripts pulled from the Command and Control (C&C) server, all controlled via parameters in HTTP GET requests.

If the visitor does not match the Googlebot crawler, a user clicking on a search result, or the backdoor, the SEO kit returns the original page from the site before it was compromised. This ensures that site owners who visit their pages directly remain unaware of the compromise.

### 3.2.2 Directory Server

The directory server's primary role is to return the location of the C&C server, either as a domain or IP address. Although its functionality is relatively simple, it serves as the first point of contact for compromised websites within the botnet. The SEO kit follows a multi-step process to locate the directory server: it first attempts to reach a hard-coded domain, then a hard-coded IP address, and finally resorts to a backup domain generation algorithm (DGA) based on a time-based function. Despite this, we found no registered backup domains up to a year into the future, suggesting that the fallback has not been necessary.

### 3.2.3 Command and Control (C&C) Server

The C&C server acts as a centralized content repository where the botmaster stores data that the compromised sites will eventually pull down. This data includes trending search terms for SEO, redirect URLs leading users to scams, and even the driver component of the SEO kit. This architecture allows the botmaster to make a single update that propagates to all active nodes in the botnet.

### 3.3 SEO Kit Evolution

An examination of the SEO kit's source code revealed comments primarily written in Russian, indicating that the campaign is likely operated by Russian speakers. These comments provided insights into previous versions of the SEO kit, such as:

- **v7.2 (14.09.11)**: Automatic cleaning of other malware.
- **v7.1 (05.09.11)**: Re-written for object-oriented model.

Table 1 summarizes the timeline of SEO kit versions and the capabilities added in each version. Key highlights include:

- **Structure**: Initially, compromised sites were divided into indexers (which SEO-ed search engine visitors) and doorways (which redirected users). Starting in August 2011, the code was merged into a single SEO kit with a unified cloaking mechanism and policy.
- **Cloaking**: Initially, both doorways and indexers used User-Agent cloaking. By late September 2010, the indexers implemented reverse DNS cloaking, and by late March 2011, the doorways adopted the same mechanism, targeting only Google traffic.
- **Redirection**: The redirection mechanism evolved from using JavaScript through an intermediary site (gogojs.net) to using HTTP 30* status with a cookie, and back to JavaScript.
- **SEO**: The SEO models and policies changed over time, from using Bing search results to employing a statistical model, and later using Google Suggest for long-tail search terms.
- **Image Search**: Significant effort was placed in poisoning Google Image Search, including hotlinking images from Bing, proxying images, and morphing images to avoid duplicate detection.

### 4 Methodology

We used data from three crawlers to track the SEO botnet and monitor its impact:

1. **Odwalla Botnet Crawler**: Tracks compromised websites and downloads SEO data from the C&C server.
2. **Search Crawler**: Identifies poisoned search results in Google to evaluate the effectiveness of the botnetâ€™s black hat SEO.
3. **Redirection Crawler**: Follows redirection chains from doorway pages to the final landing pages of scams.

#### 4.1 Odwalla Botnet Crawler

**Host Crawler**: The host crawler tracks compromised websites, using the diagnostic page provided by the SEO kit to confirm membership in the botnet and monitor the status of the compromised site. The host crawler maintains a set of potentially compromised sites and metadata, such as the representative probe URL and the last confirmed compromise date. It visits each probe URL twice: once to fetch the diagnostic page and once to fetch the SEO page. The crawling rate is adjusted based on the last confirmed compromise date.

**Bootstrap Methods**:
1. **Manual Queries**: Identified candidate sites using manual queries in Google for targeted search terms.
2. **Cross Links**: Added cross links from compromised sites to other compromised sites.
3. **Custom Bots**: Modified the SEO kit to run custom bots that infiltrated the botnet, providing the initial set of bots to track.

Once bootstrapped, the host crawler uses the cross links embedded in the SEO pages to identify new bots to track.
