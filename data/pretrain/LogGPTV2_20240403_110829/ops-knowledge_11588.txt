User: I am building python2.6 from source on Debian Lenny. 
( ./configure make make altinstall )
I don't want it to conflict with anything existing, but I want it to be in the default search path for bash. 
Suggestions?
(ps, I'm using a vm, so I can trash it and rebuild.)
Assistant: I strongly recommend you do one of these two options.

Build a .deb package, and then install the .deb package; the installed then go in the usual places (/usr/bin/python26 for the main interpreter).
Build from source, and install from source into /usr/local/bin.

I think it is a very bad idea to start putting files in the usual places, but not known or understood by the package manager.  If you built it by hand and installed it by hand, it should be confined in the /usr/local tree.
