**ATT&CK ID:** S0126  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** ComRAT

**Description:**
ComRAT samples have been observed to achieve persistence by hijacking COM (Component Object Model) objects. Specifically, these samples replace the path to `shell32.dll` in the following registry key:

```
HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1}\InprocServer32
```

This technique allows the malware to maintain a presence on the system and execute its payload whenever the associated COM object is invoked.
