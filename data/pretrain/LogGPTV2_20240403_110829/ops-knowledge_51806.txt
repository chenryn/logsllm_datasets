User: How to set nfs mount point? What details need attention?
Assistant: To set up the nfs mount point, you need to pay attention to the following details: 1. Set up the shared directory on the nfs server and confirm that the nfs service is started. 2. Make sure that the network connection between the nfs server and the client is normal, which can be tested by the ping command. 3. Install the nfs client on the client, usually the nfs-utils package. 4. Create a local mount point, which can be an empty folder for mounting nfs shared directories. 5. Use the mount command to mount the nfs shared directory, for example: mount -t nfs <nfs server IP address>:<nfs shared directory path> <local mount point> 6. If you need to automatically mount the nfs shared directory when the system starts directory, you can edit the /etc/fstab file and add mount information, for example: <nfs server IP address>:<nfs shared directory path> <local mount point> nfs defaults 0 0 7. For security issues, you can restrict the nfs server Only allow specified IPs to access the shared directory and enable authentication. 8. For performance issues, you can adjust the nfs configuration parameters of the nfs client and server, such as adjusting the read cache size, timeout, etc.
