WH compared to NLN, as shown in Table. 3. Higher APA translates
to more alternate paths in case certain links become unavailable
due to bad weather conditions, interference, or other unforeseen
events.
Link lengths: For each network, we compute all loop-free paths
between CME and NY4 that achieve latency within 5% of the c-speed
latency along the geodesic. Fig. 4(a) plots the CDFs of tower-to-
tower link lengths for all MW links on such paths. The median
length for WH (36 km) is 26% lower than NLN (48.5 km), and is
thus more robust to attenuation.
Operating frequencies: Fig. 4(b) shows the frequencies used be-
tween CME and NY4 for MW links on the shortest path for each
network. WH primarily uses the 6 Ghz frequency band, with more
than 94% of the frequencies being under 7 GHz, while NLN primar-
ily uses the 11 GHz band.
To illustrate the value of lower frequencies for reliability, we
also show the frequencies on alternate paths for NLN, using the
same alternate paths as above. On these paths, at least 18% of the
frequencies lie in the 6 Ghz frequency band.
Summary: Along each of the 3 metrics tied to reliability, WH scores
higher than NLN, even though WH’s latency is higher than NLN’s
by a few microseconds on the shortest path. Thus, in challenging
conditions, WH could offer lower latencies than NLN. The most
competitive trading firms may even use a combination of both
services to maintain their advantage in varied conditions.
6 FUTURE OUTLOOK
We see no reason to expect the HFT race in the Chicago-NJ corridor
and other similar segments to come to a halt soon: rather, networks
are likely to continue competing on ever-smaller latency differences.
Future analyses of such networks could potentially explore the
following avenues:
• Identifying the entities behind the licenses entities, by an-
alyzing items like the licensee email addresses and other
publicly available information.
• Using the above to identify which licensees are likely to be
co-owned and operated by one entity, and thus perform a
joint analysis of their owned infrastructure.

• Link lengths exhibit a complex tradeoff: longer links allow cheaper
builds using fewer towers, but are also less reliable.
• Lower operating frequencies reduce weather disruptions. If the
shortest path needs to operate at higher frequencies to cater to the
bandwidth demands, alternate paths may use lower frequencies
(like NLN’s strategy).
7 RELATED WORK
Work on financial trading activity: Past work [34] in the finan-
cial sector has found correlations between trading activity in the
Chicago–NJ corridor and latency improvements as HFT players
migrated from fiber to licensed MW networks. Our work sheds
light on the current state of the landscape, and adds longitudinal
analysis of the evolution of HFT networks. In contrast to past work,
our work is network-centric and discusses design variations such
as link lengths, frequencies and path redundancy. Further, our code
and data is publicly available [14].
HFT blogs and news: Various Web resources discuss interesting
anecdotes and insights into HFT networks [3–5]. None of these,
however, present a systematic way to collect and analyze informa-
tion on these networks, but instead rely on sources of information
as esoteric as details of court cases on real estate close to data cen-
ters. Our work, in contrast, conducts a systematic analysis based
on publicly available FCC filings data.
cISP: A recent manuscript [8] proposes low-latency terrestrial MW
networks to augment the Internet’s fiber. The network topology,
constrained by a budget, is designed to reduce aggregate end-to-
end latency. Our findings suggest reliability enhancements for such
work. Our longitudinal analysis may also help with considerations
of incremental deployment.
Radio networks as 5G backhaul: With the advent of 5G, compa-
nies are offering microwave and millimeter-wave technologies [1,
16, 17, 30] for cellular backhaul at the edge of the Internet. While
in urban settings these are aimed at enhancing capacity, in rural
areas [2, 46] such MW networks are being deployed to extend con-
nectivity. Such networks may also benefit from our analysis of
strategies for resilience.
8 CONCLUSION
Using a systematic analysis of regulatory filings, we reconstruct
high-frequency trading networks in the Chicago–New Jersey trad-
ing corridor. These networks operate at nearly the c-speed lower
bound on latency, and as we show, compete on sub-microsecond
latency differences. Our longitudinal analysis also shows that this
is a surprisingly active ecosystem, with networks pursuing varied
design strategies. To aid future work in this direction, we make our
code and data publicly available.

• Using information from radio vendors that serve this indus-
try to bound how much differences in radio technology could
create in latency beyond our distance-based analysis.
There are also two spaces where such networks may interact more
closely with the broader Internet ecosystem.
Satellite networking: Companies like SpaceX [44] and Amazon [31–
33] are deploying low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations
for offering broadband Internet. As these satellites can be as little as
300 km above the Earth’s surface, and also benefit from line-of-sight
connectivity across satellites in space, they can offer much lower
latencies than the Internet’s fiber (over long-enough distances).
The schematic in Fig. 5 shows a comparison between an LEO
constellation path and a terrestrial MW path. The overhead of going
up and down even a few hundred kilometers for LEO connectivity,
will still mean that MW networks provide lower latency. However,
this may not be the case across the ocean, where it is difficult to
build terrestrial MW connectivity. In fact, recent work shows that
for some HFT-relevant segments like Frankfurt–Washington DC,
LEO constellations may offer superior latencies than today’s HFT
networks [7].
We interpret this prior work as implying that the HFT industry
could be among the first adopters of LEO constellations, particu-
larly for longer high-value segments like Tokyo–New York. HFTs
may thus open the door for wider Internet applicability of these
networks — past satellite networking efforts failed partly due to fail-
ure to generate revenue in early operations [6]. But HFT networks
often operate on specialized equipment, fully siloed off from other
applications. If they share LEO networks with other Internet appli-
cations, these networks may need special attention to low latency
(which would benefit other Internet applications too), together with
isolation of HFT traffic. The other, less likely scenario, is entirely
HFT-focused satellite networks.
Non-HFT terrestrial MW: MW networks are already used for
mobile backhaul and increasingly, rural connectivity [29, 46], be-
cause the build-out is much faster and cheaper than laying fiber.
There is also a latency advantage, although with the downside of
more limited bandwidth. Recent work thus proposes augmenting
the Internet with a MW backbone to achieve the best of both worlds
— using the MW links for a small amount of latency-sensitive traffic,
while using fiber for other high-volume traffic [8].
While the sub-microsecond competition of HFTs is immaterial
to these efforts, the radio improvements and lessons on link redun-
dancy (§5) are certainly relevant:
• Such networks should be engineered towards high APA using
redundant MW links close to the shortest paths.
