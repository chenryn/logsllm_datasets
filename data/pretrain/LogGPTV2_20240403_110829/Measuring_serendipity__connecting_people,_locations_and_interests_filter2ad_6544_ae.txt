diagonal positions in the table are the largest for each of the
columns. Second, even if people move outside their clus-
ter, they are most likely to visit the neighboring urban area
(25% from 1 to 4, and 13% from 4 to 1). Third, people from
suburbs rarely visit downtown; they are more likely to visit
neighboring suburbs. Indeed, most of the movement shown
in the table reﬂect geographic relationships i.e., (1 and 4 are
neighbors; so are 2 and 3, 2 and 5, as well as 3 and 4).
5.1 The Potential for Location(cid:173)Based Services
Here, we explore how probable is it, and what determines
the probability, for people who share the same interests in
the cyber domain to meet as part of their daily lives? To
answer these questions, we focus on the following interest
categories: social networking, dating, and music, for their
potential to trigger serendipitous interactions. Given a set
of users with the same interest, i.e., those who have accessed
websites relevant to the interest type, either at current time
at current location or at some time before reaching the cur-
rent location, we compute the following two interaction met-
rics.
Time-independent interactions. We consider the over-
lap in trajectories between users of the same interest, irre-
spective of the actual time of overlap. This is relevant for
location-based tagging services [1] where users leave geo-tags
for a location which can be picked by other users who are in
its vicinity.
Time-dependent interactions. In this more restrictive
type of interaction, we consider that users with same interest
are present in the same location at the same time instance.
This type of interaction is the basis for location-aware mo-
bile social networking, and other location-based services.
We consider two versions of the above questions: (i) How
many unique people sharing the same cyber interests are
likely to meet each other (in both time-dependent or inde-
pendent manner)? (ii) How many interactions are people
who share the same interest likely to have?
The ﬁrst insight (not shown in a ﬁgure due to space con-
straints) is that the number of unique people sharing the
same interests that meet each other is larger in region 4
(downtown) than in region 1 (neighboring urban area). This
holds true both for time-independent and time-dependent
interactions, and for all applications of interest. This is be-
cause the number of users is much larger in region 4 (82k)
than in region 1 (54k). Hence, even if the user mobility pat-
terns are similar in both regions, the probability of meeting
diﬀerent people is larger in a more populated region.
On the other hand, the results are reversed when con-
sidering the number of interactions with people who share
similar interests, as we will show below. In particular, for
time-independent interactions, we not only detect that two
users met, but also count the number of places they met at.
For time-dependent interactions, we count not only that two
users met each other once at a location, but count all such
contacts.
Figure 9 shows the number of time-independent and -
dependent interactions as a function of diﬀerent locations.
We plot the curves in Figure 9 based on the decreasing num-
ber of meeting events. Hence, the order of locations (base-
stations) on the x-axis, while similar, is not identical. Our
insights are the following.
First, the number of interactions for time-independent in-
teractions is necessarily larger than for time-dependent in-
teractions since the probability to meet a person at a given
location and at the same time is smaller than the probabil-
ity that the two trajectories overlap. As a result, the scale
on the y-axis in Figure 9(b) is an order of magnitude larger
than that of Figure 9(c). Also, social networking and mu-
sic curves are above dating, because these applications are
more popular.
Second, for both time-independent and -dependent inter-
actions, the regions that provide most interactions for either
of the interests, social networking, dating and music, are or-
dered in descending order as: 1, 4, 3, 2 and 5. To see why
this happens, ﬁrst note that the top-most locations in Figure
9(a) for regions 1 and 4 are hotspots. The urban regions 1
and 4 have higher number of interactions than other regions
mainly because of the large number of hotspots in these re-
gions as shown in Table 3. Most interestingly, even though
region 4 (downtown) contains larger user population than
region 1, the order between them is reversed in terms of
interactions. We explore the reasons for this further.
The key reason is the density of hotspots in a region, de-
ﬁned as a fraction of locations in a region that are hotspots.
A region with higher hotspot density provides more chances
for interactions. For instance, consider music interest. Based
on Table 3, region 1 has 27 night hotspots from 162 base-
stations, and hence a night hotspot density of 17%. The
regions in descending order in terms of night hotspot den-
sity are: 1, 4, 3, 5 and 2. The same order amongst regions
is found for noon (social networking) and evening (dating)
hotspots as well. Hotspot density is able to explain inter-
actions as the top three regions in terms of interactions are
also 1, 4 and 3. For regions 2 and 5, the number of hotspots
is small, hence, non-hotspots inﬂuence interactions as well.
Hence, for the same mobility properties, the probability of
accessing a hotspot is larger in region 1, and thus the num-
ber of interactions increases.

The ﬁnal question that we explore is the following: given
the impact that hotspots have on interactions, who will ‘ex-
perience’ a larger number of social interactions: a mobile
user or a stationary user present at a hotspot? For this ex-
periment, we cluster out 3 categories of users: (i) mobile
users that have been seen in at least 20 locations, (ii) static
hotspot users that have spent at least 6 hours in a hotspot,
and (iii) static non-hotspot users who have spent at least
6 hours in a non-hotspot. Table 5 shows the results. Most
interactions are observed by mobile users, since they meet
more users than others. Still, the results show that it pays
oﬀ to spend a considerable amount of time at a popular loca-
tion. Indeed, the result shows that static hotspot users are

6. RELATED WORK
The increasing ease in availability of digital footprints of
humans via the mobile devices they carry, has led to a
plethora of studies on human movement. One such group
of work [10, 13, 17, 22] explores the possibility for delay-
tolerant networking, i.e., opportunistic peer-to-peer deliv-
ery of messages between mobile devices coming within Blue-
tooth or WiFi radio range of each other. Such studies are
based on data sets with ﬁne-grained meeting information,
e.g., [10, 17] use contact information polled from a set of
various datasets which use diﬀerent technologies (e.g. blue-
tooth, wi-ﬁ, etc) to study the inter-contact times between
devices while [13, 22] use bluetooth on a sample set of 100
subjects to study the chance of meeting someone. In con-
trast, the motivating application for our study is serendip-
itous location-based service, for which coarse-grained loca-
tion information at the level of neighborhood or city can be
a suﬃcient trigger for two users to decide to meet. While
our study here does not directly address peer-to-peer mes-
sage delivery, our ﬁndings do have indirect implications to
such applications as well. In particular, our observation on
the aﬃnity between a location hotspot and an application
type suggests that is at these places that such services will
be most likely used.
Another body of work is focused on modeling human tra-
jectories [19]. Recently, authors in[20] studied the trajectory
of 100k anonymized mobile phone users and determined that
the trajectory of humans is not as random as predicted by
the earlier models (L`evy ﬂight and random walk models)
and in fact humans exhibit a high degree of temporal and
spatial regularity. Our ﬁndings regarding this are similar,
in that humans are very likely to spend most of their time
in their three most preferred locations. While our data set
is also from a mobile carrier, our trace is primarily from the
data network (HTTP and MMS) while [20] uses phone calls
and SMS logs. Regardless, this points to an important ev-
idence that human movement studies such as ours and [20]
are not biased by the data source they are based on.
In
contrast, our goals in this paper are very diﬀerent, to study
human movement patterns when correlated with application
interests.
A third body of work [26] has studied mobility in the con-
text of sequential rule mining, where the goal is to extract
the most frequent trajectory sequences. We adapt [25, 26]
to develop our binary rule framework to identify the basic
mobility patterns and then extend the same to perform a
novel joint study of application and mobility. Finally, rule
mining has also been used in the context of other applica-
tions, e.g. identifying patterns in shopping transactions [8,
25], identifying cause-eﬀect pairs in network traﬃc [16], etc.
The fact that each user is usually associated with three lo-
cations (comfort zone) is most closely related to [15], where
the authors used an anonymized data set from U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau to ﬁnd that a user’s work and home location
at the granularity of census tract (zip-code) can be used to
uniquely identify about 5% of users. However, such recon-
struction as suggested in [15] requires an adversary to have
access to a mapping between the home/work locations and
user identities, the availability of which we are not aware of;
even the data set used in [15] was synthetic due to privacy
concerns.
7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we conducted, to the best of our knowledge,
the ﬁrst large-scale study to characterize the relationship
that exists between people’s cyber interests and their mo-
bility properties. Our key ﬁnding is that both users’ mobility
and locations heavily impact their application access behav-
ior. We believe our results demonstrate signiﬁcant promise
for further research in this area, paving the way for many
advances in understanding basic human behavior and in de-
veloping location-based services.
Summary. From the user perspective, our insights are
the following:
(i) Most users spend the vast majority of
their time within the ‘comfort zone’ which consists of the top
three locations, including home and work. (ii) Within the
‘comfort zone’, music prevails, particularly from home. Out-
side the ‘comfort zone’, the popularity of such bandwidth
and battery intensive applications quickly fades. (iii) Dat-
ing applications are mostly accessed from within the ‘com-
fort’ zone, but neither from home nor work. (iv) Users who
leave the ‘comfort zone’ have an inclination to ‘staying con-
nected’ by accessing social networking sites, reading e-mail
and news.
From the perspective of the most popular locations, our
insights are the following: (i) There is a strong time-invariant
bias towards speciﬁc applications at those locations at which
hotspots are likely to occur. (ii) In most cases, such a bias
remains unchanged when hotspots are created, i.e., those
278who join the hotspot show the same access behavior. (iii)
Oﬃce hotspots are the only scenario in which the newly cre-
ated majority manages to change the previously established
application access bias.
From the user interactions perspective, our insights are
the following: (i) The probability to meet diﬀerent people
with the same cyber interests is dominantly impacted by the
number of users sharing the same interests in a given region.
(ii) However, the frequency with which one meets with oth-
ers who share the same cyber interests is dominated by the
density of hotspots in a given area. (iii) Both mobile users
and those present at popular hotspots have the potential to
achieve a large number of interactions.
From the mobile provider and location-based services per-
spective, our insights are the following: (i) The observed
location-based application access bias validates the enor-
mous potential for existing location-based services, and opens
the doors to a number of new ones. (ii) Due to the strong
bias towards bandwidth intensive applications at a subset of
hotspots, base-station-level caching at such locations would
be very beneﬁcial. (iii) There exists a signiﬁcant observed
anti-correlation between the use of bandwidth- and battery-
intensive applications, such as music, with mobility. This
ﬁnding can be a strong indicator of whether p2p-based mo-
bile applications have a potential need or not; yet, we are
unable to provide such a prediction. If the small usage is due
to bandwidth concerns, then p2p mobile applications have
a huge potential. Yet if battery is the concern, the result is
reversed.
