Abstract—Physical-layer attacks allow attackers to manipu-
late (spoof) ranging and positioning. These attacks had real-
world impact and allowed car thefts, executions of unauthorized
payments and manipulation of navigation. UWB impulse radio,
standardized within 802.15.4a,f, has emerged as a prominent
technique for precise ranging that allows high operating distances
despite power constraints by transmitting multi-pulse symbols.
Security of UWB ranging (in terms of the attacker’s ability
to manipulate the measured distance) has been discussed in
the literature and is, since recently also being addressed as a
part of the emerging 802.15.4z standard. However, all research
so far, as well as security enhancements proposed within this
emerging standard face one main limitation: they achieve security
through short symbol lengths and sacriﬁce performance (i.e., limit
the maximum distance of measurement), or use longer symbol
lengths, therefore sacriﬁcing security. We present UWB with pulse
reordering (UWB-PR), the ﬁrst modulation scheme that secures
distance measurement between two mutually trusted devices
against all physical-layer distance shortening attacks without sac-
riﬁcing performance, therefore simultaneously enabling extended
range and security. We analyze the security of UWB-PR under
the attacker that fully controls the communication channel and
show that UWB-PR resists such strong attackers. We evaluate
UWB-PR within a UWB system built on top of the IEEE 802.15.4
device and show that it achieves distances of up to 93m with 10cm
precision (LoS). UWB-PR is, therefore, a good candidate for the
extended mode of the new 802.15.4z Low Rate Pulse standard.
Finally, UWB-PR shows that secure distance measurement can
be built on top of modulation schemes with longer symbol lengths
- so far, this was considered insecure.
I. INTRODUCTION
Proximity and distance have been so far used in a number of
security and safety-critical applications. Proximity can indicate
an intent to open cars, ofﬁces, execute payments, establish
cryptographic keys and access data. Measurement of distances
and position helps devices navigate, ﬁnd other devices and
optimize message routing. Numerous wireless ranging and
localization techniques have been developed in the last decade.
These are based on time of arrival, time difference of arrival,
phase [34] as well as RSSI measurements [7]. However, these

techniques have been shown to be vulnerable to physical-
layer attacks [27]; most notable examples include spooﬁng
attacks on GPS [24], [19], relay attacks on passive entry/start
systems in cars [15] and credit card payments [16]. Those
vulnerabilities have real-world implications, as shown by a
recent car theft that found widespread media attention [5].
In attacks on ranging, manipulations on the physical layer
allow the attacker to reduce distances that devices measure,
therefore violating the security of the systems that rely on
this information (e.g., allowing the car to be unlocked and
started [15]). At the logical layer, such manipulations, called
Maﬁa Fraud Attacks are easily prevented using distance-
bounding protocols [8]. Unlike logical-layer attacks that use
manipulations of message bits, physical-layer attacks involve
the manipulation of signal characteristics with the goal of
fooling the receiver into decoding incorrect bits or incorrectly
measuring signal phase, amplitude or time of arrival. A num-
ber of ranging systems have been shown to be vulnerable
to physical-layer attacks: e.g., UWB 802.15.4a to Cicada
attack [25], Phase ranging [3] to phase manipulation [23]
and early detect / late commit (ED/LC) [12], Chirp Spread
Spectrum to ED/LC [28]. These attacks are effective despite
authentication and distance-bounding protocols [8], [20], since
they target the physical layer and do not change the message
content.
UWB impulse radio, standardized within 802.15.4a,f, has
emerged as a prominent technique for precise ranging. Prior
research [32], [12] has shown UWB IR can be used to prevent
distance manipulation attacks by using short UWB pulses for
precise and secure time-of-ﬂight (ToF) measurements. This
results in modulations that encode each bit as a single UWB
pulse [32]. Instantaneous transmit power in any practical UWB
system faces constraints originating from both regulatory
bodies as well as hardware integration concerns. Namely, the
energy of the pulse is limited therefore limiting the range.
In addition, standards imposed limitations on the amount
of energy that can be placed in a short time frame further
rendering single pulse systems inadequate for non-line-of-
sight (NLoS) and long-distance communication. Therefore, for
distance measurement under such conditions, we need longer
symbols with multiple pulses per bit. However, increasing the
symbol length has shown to be vulnerable to ED/LC [12],
enabling distance reduction attacks by an untrusted (i.e.,
external) man in the middle. This is essentially a comeback
of Maﬁa Fraud; an attack assumed to be solved on the logical
(bit-) level through a rapid bit exchange, this time executed
purely on the symbol level, in a way independent of guarantees
provided by distance-bounding protocols. With respect to this
attack, existing systems can be either secure or performant, in
terms of their range and resilience to NLoS conditions but not
both.
Security of UWB ranging is since recently being addressed
as a part of the emerging 802.15.4z standard [2]. Existing
802.15.4z proposals, however, achieve security through short
symbol lengths thus by limiting the maximum distance of
measurement, or use longer symbol lengths, therefore, risking
attacks.
In this work, we address this problem and propose UWB
with pulse reordering (UWB-PR), the ﬁrst modulation scheme
that secures distance measurement between two mutually
trusted devices against all physical-layer distance reduction
attacks and enables long-range distance measurements. UWB-
PR prevents Maﬁa-Fraud-like attacks at the physical layer.
UWB-PR uses pulse reordering and cryptographic pulse blind-
ing to prevent physical-layer attacks, allowing UWB systems
to securely scale to longer symbols (multiple pulses per bit) for
long distance and performance. UWB-PR is compatible with
802.15.4 UWB as well as FCC and ETSI regulations. This
makes it a good candidate for the Low Rate Pulse mode of
the upcoming 802.15.4z standard. In the follow-up work, the
authors have used similar cryptographic operations to solve a
related problem – distance enlargement [31].
UWB-PR provides quantiﬁable probabilistic security guar-
antees without making any assumptions regarding channel
conditions or attacker positions. Finally, UWB-PR combines
data transfer and distance measurement and allows secure
distance measurement on multi-bit nonces. It
is therefore
compatible with the majority of existing distance-bounding
protocols [8], [17].
We analyze the security of UWB-PR analytically and
through simulations. We show that, at any symbol length,
UWB-PR allows to extract security guarantees from longer
nonces nV E and nP R in two ways. First, more bits interleaved
by means of the reordering operation lower an attacker’s
chances of guessing any individual bit. Second, longer overall
nonces decrease the chances of an attacker guessing the entire
sequence nV E or nP R, as all bits have to be guessed correctly.

Finally, UWB-PR shows that a number of assumptions that
were made with respect to the design and implementation of
distance-bounding protocols [12] are not correct. In particular,
we show that these protocols do not need to rely on the rapid
bit-exchange nor do they have to be implemented on top of
modulation schemes that have short symbol lengths. UWB-
PR shows that secure distance measurement can be built on
top of modulation schemes with longer symbol lengths. In
the existing literature [12] this was considered insecure. We
discuss this further in Section VII.

II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
A. Distance-Bounding Protocols
Distance-bounding protocols are challenge-response proto-
cols designed to determine an upper bound on the physical dis-
tance between two communicating parties, therefore prevent-
ing distance-reduction attacks. To secure ranging, distance-
bounding protocols send cryptographically generated chal-
lenges and expect the correct response within a certain time
window. The ﬁrst distance-bounding protocol was proposed
by Brands and Chaum and is illustrated in Figure 1. In this
protocol, the veriﬁer (V E) challenges the prover (P R) with
a random nonce nV E and measures the time until it receives
the response, calculated by the prover using his secret nP R.
This time is then converted into an upper bound on the
distance between the veriﬁer and the prover. The Brands-
Chaum protocol prevents distance reduction from an external
attacker. This type of attacker model
is known as Maﬁa
Fraud and depicted in Figure 2. More recent distance-bounding
protocols focus on other types of attacks, such as Terrorist
Fraud and Distance Hijacking [21], [9], [29], [17].

Existing distance-measurement techniques are all vulnerable to physical-layer attacks. RSSI and phase-based ranging have been shown to be vulnerable
to relay attacks. Time-of-ﬂight and time-delay-of-ﬂight ranging have been attacked in Cicada and ED/LC attacks.
Given the assumption that the attacker fully controls the
communication channel between V E and P R, the attacker can
always increase the measured time and therefore the measured
distance. However, the attacker cannot trivially reduce this
distance - unless it can guess nV E or nP R or manipulate the
time of ﬂight by attacking the physical layer. Longer nonces
nV E and nP R lower an attacker’s chances of guessing all bits.
The only remaining concern in these protocols are therefore
physical-layer attacks by which an attacker can try to trick
P R (resp. V E) to measure an earlier arrival time of nV E
(resp. nP R). If this attack succeeds, the measured distance
will be shorter than the actual distance. The success of such
a physical-layer attack depends on the ranging system and on
the modulation scheme that supports it. As we show in the
review below, all existing ranging schemes are vulnerable to
physical-layer attacks.
B. Physical-Layer Attacks
Existing ranging systems are typically vulnerable to one
of three types of attacks: Relay, Cicada [27] and Early-
Detect/Late-Commit. These are illustrated in Figure 3.
Relay Attack: In a relay attack, the signal is fed through
an alternative signal propagation path by an attacker, allowing
the attacker to exert control over some physical properties of
the signal. Speciﬁcally, the attacker can control signal strength
as well as the signal phase. To attack an RSSI based ranging
system, the attacker simply ampliﬁes the signal close to the
transmitter until the received signal strength is consistent with
the expected path loss over the claimed distance. Similarly,
the signal phase can be manipulated by the attacker in order
to be consistent with the propagation delay introduced by the
claimed distance. Relay attacks are conceptually simple and
have been successfully performed in a number of systems
including WiFi [33], PKES systems [15] and NFC [16]. It is
important to note that a relay by deﬁnition serves to extend the
communication path, thereby increasing the time of ﬂight of
the signal. Therefore, any ranging system relying on a signal’s
time of ﬂight is inherently resistant to a relay attack, no matter
the capability of the relay (e.g., it being duplex or not).
Early-Detect and Late-Commit (ED/LC) Attack: In this
attack, the attacker learns symbol values early and commits
them late in order to fool receivers about the signal arrival
time. An attacker thereby relies on the predictability of the
inner signal structure of a symbol. In an early-detection phase,
the adversarial receiver detects a symbol using only the initial
part of the symbol - i.e., within time TED < Tsym. The
detection of the symbol is possible within TED as the attacker
can position his receiver close to the transmitter and get a
higher SNR than the legitimate receiver. In a late-commit
phase, the adversary forges the symbol such that the small
initial part of the symbol
is noncommittal (i.e., does not
indicate a bit), whereas the last part of the symbol TLC
corresponds to one of the bits. In this way, the attacker can
start sending a symbol before knowing which symbol should
be sent. This attack has been demonstrated on time-of-ﬂight-
based systems, such as 802.15.4a Chirp Spread Spectrum [28]
and 802.15.4a IR-UWB [13], [26]. Section VIII discusses in
more detail the implications of ED/LC attacks in the context
of IEEE 802.15.4a.
Cicada Attack: Time-of-ﬂight (ToF)-based ranging systems
rely on ﬁne time resolution to estimate distance precisely. The
Cicada attack [25] exploits the search algorithm that is used
in UWB ToF systems which ﬁrst detects the peak pulse and
then performs a search to ﬁnd the leading pulse edge. In this
attack, the attacker injects pulses ahead of the legitimate pulses
that are exchanged between the communicating devices. When
receivers then detect the time of arrival of the pulse, they
will perform a search, now extended due to attackers injected
signals, and will, therefore, register an earlier arrival time.
This attack has been demonstrated on 802.15.4a IR-UWB [25].
Limiting the search window can prevent this attack, but it
affects the performance of the system. The Cicada attack
shows that a careful design of time-of-arrival detection is
needed in the design of secure distance measurement radios.
C. UWB-IR
Impulse-radio UWB systems are ideal candidates for high-
precision ranging, and low-power IR-UWB ranging systems

and IEEE 802.15.4f have standardized IR-UWB as the most
prominent technique for precision ranging. These standards
allow the use of a 500MHz-bandwidth channel located in a
frequency range between approximately 3GHz and 10GHz.
Transmit power is limited by FCC and ETSI regulations. The
standards do not specify transmitter or receiver implementa-
tions. Nevertheless, they propose different modulation schemes
with different pulse repetition frequency (PRF), separate op-
erating modes for long and short-range, and receivers suitable
for ranging. The modulations as proposed in IEEE 802.15.4a
and 802.15.4f are illustrated in Figure 4. 802.15.4a uses burst
position modulation (BPM) and binary phase shift keying
(BPSK), to accommodate for both coherent and noncoherent
receivers. 802.15.4f supports a base mode that encodes each
bit in one pulse (on-off keying) as well as extended and long-
range modes that encode each bit in multiple UWB pulses.
802.15.4f achieve lower complexity, in term of low power
consumption and low cost by using OOK modulation and non-
