# TrackWatcher Server Framework
## Figure 2: TrackWatcher Server Framework

### User Privacy Classification
- **Strong**: If \( P_{u,0} \) is between 0.9 and 1.0.
- **Medium**: If \( P_{u,0} \) is between 0.6 and 0.9.
- **Weak**: If \( P_{u,0} \) is between 0 and 0.6.

The computed predicted value from the recommendation server, \( P_{u,j} \), is compared with \( P_{u,0} \). If \( P_{u,j} \) is no less than \( P_{u,0} \), the third-party website is allowed. Otherwise, it is blocked.

## Future Work
We have proposed a novel framework to mitigate web tracking while balancing personalization and privacy in a recommendation system. In the future, we plan to:
- Implement client-side TrackWatcher as a Firefox add-on.
- Collect adequate user data to validate our system.
- Implement our recommendation system and evaluate it using real-world user data.

### Correlation Calculation
The correlation between web users \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \) is denoted as \( \text{corr}(u_1, u_2) \), ranging from -1 to +1. \( T \) is the set of pairs rated by both \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \). \( \bar{v}_{u_1} \) and \( \bar{v}_{u_2} \) denote the average ratings of \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \) respectively. \( v_{u_1, i} \) and \( v_{u_2, i} \) represent the ratings of \( u_1 \) and \( u_2 \) on pair \( i \).

### Predicted Rating Calculation
The predicted rating of web user \( u \) on pair \( j \) is generated using Equation (2):

\[ P_{u, j} = \frac{\sum_{u' \in U} \text{corr}(u, u') \cdot (v_{u', j} - \bar{v}_{u'})}{\sum_{u' \in U} |\text{corr}(u, u')|} \]

where \( U \) denotes the set of all web users who have rated pair \( j \).

### Utility-Based Filtering
To address the new user ramp-up problem in collaborative filtering, we introduce utility-based filtering. Each first-party website and third-party tracker pair (A, B) is described with a vector of features (UserType, FPW Type, TPW Type). The function \( f(\text{UType}, \text{FPW}, \text{TPW}) \) is defined in Table 1. \( f(\text{UType}, \text{FPW}, \text{TPW}) = 1 \) if the TPW is allowed; otherwise, \( f(\text{UType}, \text{FPW}, \text{TPW}) = 0 \).

The input function for computing the predicted rating of pair (A, B) is given by:

\[ P_{u, j} = \max(0, \min(1, \min(1, \text{Pr}_j \cdot f(\text{UType}, \text{FPW}, \text{TPW})) \cdot U_M)) \]

where \( \text{Pr}_j \) denotes the permission percentage of pair \( j \) among all web users.

### Table 1: Definition of Function \( f(\text{UType}, \text{FPW}, \text{TPW}) \)

| User Privacy Type (UType) | Strong | Medium | Weak |
|---------------------------|--------|--------|------|
| Level 1                   | 1      | 1      | 1, 2 |
| Level 2                   | 1      | 1, 2   | 1, 2, 3 |
| Level 3                   | 1, 2   | 1, 2, 3| 1, 2, 3 |

### Combining Collaborative and Utility-Based Filtering
We use switching methods to combine collaborative and utility-based filtering. When the number of available rating data \( |U| \) is less than a defined constant \( M \), the system uses the utility-based approach. Otherwise, the collaborative filtering method is used.

### User-Specified Permission
Each user can specify a value \( P_{u,0} \) (ranging from 0 to 1) for third-party tracker permission. The user's privacy type is classified based on this value.
