“Weak” for 0-0.6. Finally, Pu,j , the computed predicted value from 
the recommendation server, would be compared with Pu,0. If Pu,j  
is  no  less  than  Pu,0,  the  third-party  website  would  be  allowed. 
Otherwise, the third-party website would be blocked.

Utility-based  filtering  techniques:  Since  new  user  ramp-up 
problem  exists  in  collaborative  filtering,  we  introduce  utility-
based filtering technique into our hybrid recommendation model. 
Utility-based filtering describes each first-party website and third-
party tracker pair (A, B) with a vector of features (UserType, FPW 
Type, TPW Type). The function f(UType, FPW, TPW) is defined 
in Table 1. Note that f(UType, FPW, TPW)=1 when the TPW is 
allowed based on Table 1. Otherwise, f(UType, FPW, TPW)=0. 
Then  we  define  input  function  Equation  (3)  to  compute  the 
predicted rating of pair (A, B).

We  apply  switching  methods  to  combine  both  collaborative 
filtering  and  utility-based  filtering  techniques.  To  be  specific, 
when the available number of rating data |U| is less than a defined 
constant  M,  the  system  would  choose  the  utility-based  function 
approach to provide recommendation information. Otherwise, the 
recommendation  server  would  select  the  collaborative  filtering 
method to generate recommendation information. 
Every  user  can  specify  a  value  Pu,0 (ranging  from  0  to  1)  for 
third-party tracker permission. The user privacy type is classified
