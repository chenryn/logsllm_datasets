Hey there! First off: thanks a lot for putting this library online. The
community will definitely benefit from having such an easy path to super-
performant pages üëç
I was actually evaluating next.js for creating a docs for one of my github
repos, but only later I realised that the next.js build process doesn't output
any html pages which can be used for e.g. gh-pages. This would actually be a
really nice option to have and I guess a common enough use case!
In case it's helpful, I'll link to this library which I successfully used to
do something very similar.
