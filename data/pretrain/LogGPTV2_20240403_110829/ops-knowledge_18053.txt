User: I have written a proprietary application that needs to install some .pyo files. When I create a .deb from the app, lintian complains that package-installs-python-bytecode. I tried adding an override, but apparently this tag is marked as non-overridable by ftp-master-auto-reject.profile in /usr/share/lintian/profiles/debian. Since this tag is considered an Error, Ubuntu Software Center complains about the package.
Is there a clean way to override this tag so that Ubuntu Software Center no longer complains?
Assistant: For future reference, here's what I did.

I generated and packaged the .pyo files into their own tar.gz file
In the postinst script, the tar.gz file is extracted, and the tar.gz file is deleted
In the postrm script, the pyo files are deleted.

This isn't the nicest solution in the world, but it works with Debian/Ubuntu's overly draconian policies (which don't even make sense; if I can install a binary, why not a pyo?).
Hopefully this helps someone out.
