**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Rootkit

Adversaries may deploy rootkits to conceal the presence of malicious programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are specialized programs designed to intercept and modify operating system API calls that provide system information, thereby hiding the existence of malware. These rootkits can operate at various levels within the system, including the user level, kernel level, or even at a lower level, such as in the firmware.
