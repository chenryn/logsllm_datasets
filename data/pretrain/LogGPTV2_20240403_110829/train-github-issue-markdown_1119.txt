Hi,  
I'm working on node.js with npm. I've written a TS library and I want to use
it in another project by doing npm install.  
I'm not sure what will should be the contents in my npm package:  
should it be only .js, only .ts, or .js with additional declaration files
(d.ts)?
Furthermore if I'm using the third option, what exactly am I writing in the
definition file? how exactly am I using it?I'm not sure what's the connection
between d.ts and the actual javascript.  
I see a lot of different answers but most them didn't help me.
Thanks,  
Omer
