Figure 7: Bounds on the maximum identiﬁability
Ω under CAP, CSP, and UP for densely-connected
random topologies (|V | = 20, µ = 2, . . . , 10, E[|L|] = 99,
50 graph instances per model).
AS6461 has the maximum ratio µc/|V | of approximately
0.665. Thus, we start the simulation from µ/|V | = 0.665.
Similar to the case of random topologies, the results show
clear diﬀerences between the maximum identiﬁability under
diﬀerent probing mechanisms, especially between ΩCAP and
the other two. For most of the networks, UP and CSP only
guarantee unique localization of single-node failures, while
CAP can handle multi-node failures for all the networks.
We also observe a much larger gap between ΩCAP and ΩCSP
than the gap between ΩCSP and ΩUP, as the AS topolo-
gies are relatively sparse, leaving monitors little ﬂexibility
in selecting probing paths under cycle-free constraints (i.e.,
CSP). Across the networks, we observe that the ordering
of the normalized maximum identiﬁability Ω/σ is roughly
consistent with the minimum monitor fraction of monitors

µc/|V | required by ERMP: the larger µc/|V |, the smaller
Ω/σ.
Because ISP topologies have evolved since the Rocket-
fuel project, we repeat the above evaluation on a recent
dataset obtained by the CAIDA project; see results in Fig. 9.
Compared with the Rocketfuel ASes, we observe that the
CAIDA ASes require more monitors (computed by step (i) of
ERMP), e.g., the largest fraction µc/|V | is 0.89 for AS26788
while the smallest is 0.74 for AS28583. Hence, we start from
µ/|V | = 0.89 in Fig. 9. Similar to Fig. 8, we again observe
a huge gap between ΩCAP and the other two, and Ω/σ is in-
versely related to µc/|V |. In addition, Fig. 9 also shows that
under the minimum monitor placement, even the most ﬂex-
ible probing mechanism, CAP, can only localize failures of
a couple of nodes. Our results suggest that without control
207of probing paths (i.e., UP), randomly placed monitors are
unlikely to guarantee unique failure localization; therefore,
optimized monitor placement is needed to handle simultane-
ous failures of multiple nodes. Moreover, these results also
imply that in the absence of deploying monitors at the vast
majority of nodes, implementing controllable probing is an
eﬀective way to guarantee unique failure localization.
7. CONCLUSION
We have studied the fundamental capability of a network
to localize failed nodes from the health condition of end-to-
end paths between monitors. We proposed a novel measure,
called the maximum identiﬁability, to quantify this capabil-
ity as the maximum number of simultaneous failures that
can be uniquely localized. We studied this measure in de-
tail for three representative families of probing mechanisms
that oﬀer diﬀerent tradeoﬀs between the controllability of
probes and the cost of implementation. For each family
of probing mechanisms, we established necessary/suﬃcient
conditions for unique failure localization based on the net-
work topology, the placement of monitors, the constraints
on measurement paths, and the maximum number of simul-
taneous failures. We further showed that these conditions
lead to tight upper/lower bounds on the maximum identiﬁ-
ability that diﬀer by at most one. We showed that both the
conditions and the bounds can be evaluated eﬃciently us-
ing polynomial-time algorithms. Our evaluations on random
and real network topologies reveal that although incurring a
higher implementation cost, giving the monitors more con-
trol over the routing of probes can signiﬁcantly improve their
capability to localize simultaneous failures.
