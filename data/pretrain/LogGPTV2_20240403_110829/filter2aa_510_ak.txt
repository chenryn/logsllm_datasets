Listing Mail Service Statistics
You can use the serveradmin getHistory command to display a log of periodic 
samples of the number of user connections and the data throughput. Samples are 
taken once each minute.
To list samples:
$ sudo serveradmin command
mail:command = getHistory
mail:variant = statistic
mail:timeScale = scale
Control-D
Output
mail:nbSamples =

Parameter
Description
statistic
The value you want to display.
Valid values:
v1 - number of connected users (average during sampling period)
v2 - data throughput (bytes/sec)
scale
The length of time in seconds, ending with the current time, for 
which you want to see samples. For example, to see 24 hours of 
data, you would specify mail:timeScale = 86400.
Value displayed by getHistory
Description
The total number of samples listed.
The numerical value of the sample.
For connections (v1), this is integer average number of users.
For throughput, (v2), this is integer bytes per second.
The time at which the sample was measured. A standard UNIX time 
(number of seconds since Sep 1, 1970.) Samples are taken every 60 
seconds.

Setting Up SSL for Mail Service
Mail service requires some configuration to provide Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
connections automatically. The basic steps are as follows:
• Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and create a keychain.
• Obtain an SSL certificate from an issuing authority.
• Import the SSL certificate into the keychain.
• Create a passphrase file.
Generating a CSR and Creating a Keychain
To begin configuring Mail service for SSL connections, you generate a CSR and create a 
keychain by using the command-line tool certtool. A CSR is a file that provides 
information needed to issue an SSL certificate.
1 Log in to the server as root.
2 In the Terminal application, type the following two commands:
$ cd /private/var/root/Library/Keychains/
$ /usr/bin/certtool r csr.txt k=certkc c
This use of the certtool command begins an interactive process that generates a 
Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in the file csr.txt and creates a keychain named certkc.
3 In the New Keychain Passphrase dialog that appears, enter a passphrase or password 
for the keychain you’re creating, enter the password or passphrase a second time to 
verify it, and click OK. 
Remember this passphrase, because later you must supply it again.
4 When “Enter key and certificate label:” appears in the Terminal window, type a one-
word key, a blank space, and a one-word certificate label, then press Return.
For example, you could type your organization’s name as the key and mailservice as 
the certificate label.
5 Type r when prompted to select a key algorithm, then press Return.
Please specify parameters for the key pair you will generate.
  r  RSA
  d  DSA
  f  FEE
Select key algorithm by letter: 
6 Type a key size at the next prompt, then press Return.
Valid key sizes for RSA are 512..2048; default is 512
Enter key size in bits or CR for default: 
Larger key sizes are more secure, but require more processing time on your server. Key 
sizes smaller than 1024 aren’t accepted by some certificate-issuing authorities. 
LL2354.book  Page 119  Monday, October 20, 2003  9:47 AM
120
Chapter 11    Working With Mail Service
7 Type y when prompted to confirm the algorithm and key size, then press Return.
You have selected algorithm RSA, key size (size entered above) bits.
OK (y/anything)? 
8 Type b when prompted to specify how this certificate will be used, then press Return.
Enter cert/key usage (s=signing, b=signing AND encrypting): 
9 Type s when prompted to select a signature algorithm, then press Return.
...Generating key pair...
Please specify the algorithm with which your certificate will be signed.
  5  RSA with MD5
  s  RSA with SHA1
Select signature algorithm by letter: 
10 Type y when asked to confirm the selected algorithm, then press Return.
You have selected algorithm RSA with SHA1.
OK (y/anything)? 
11 Enter a phrase or some random text when prompted to enter a challenge string, then 
press Return. 
...creating CSR...
Enter challenge string: 
12 Enter the correct information at the next five prompts, which request the various 
components of the certificate’s Relative Distinguished Name (RDN), pressing return 
after each entry.
For Common Name, enter the server's DNS name, such as server.example.com.
For Country, enter the country in which your organization is located.
For Organization, enter the organization to which your domain name is 
registered.
For Organizational Unit, enter something similar to a department name.
For State/Province, enter the full name of your state or province.
13 Type y when asked to confirm the information you entered, then press Return.
Is this OK (y/anything)? 
When you see a message about writing to csr.txt, you have successfully generated a 
CSR and created the keychain that Mail service needs for SSL connections. 
Wrote (n) bytes of CSR to csr.txt

121
Obtaining an SSL Certificate
After generating a CSR and a keychain, you continue configuring Mail service for 
automatic SSL connections by purchasing an SSL certificate from a certificate authority 
such as Verisign or Thawte. You can do this by completing a form on the certificate 
authority’s website. When prompted for your CSR, open the csr.txt file using a text 
editor such as TextEdit. Then copy and paste the contents of the file into the 
appropriate field on the certificate authority’s website. The websites for these certificate 
authorities are at
• www.verisign.com
• www.thawte.com
When you receive your certificate, save it in a text file named sslcert.txt. You can save 
this file with the TextEdit application. Make sure the file is plain text, not rich text, and 
contains only the certificate text. 
Importing an SSL Certificate Into the Keychain
To import an SSL certificate into a keychain, use the command-line tool certtool. This 
continues the configuration of Mail service for automatic SSL connections.
1 Log in to the server as root.
2 Open the Terminal application.
3 Go to the directory where the saved certificate file is located. 
For example, type cd /private/var/root/Desktop and press Return if the certificate 
file is saved on the desktop of the root user. 
4 Type the following command and press Return:
certtool i sslcert.txt k=certkc
Using certtool this way imports a certificate from the file named sslcert.txt into the 
keychain named certkc. 
A message on screen confirms that the certificate was successfully imported.
...certificate successfully imported.

Chapter 11    Working With Mail Service
Creating a Passphrase File
To create a passphrase file, you will use TextEdit, then change the privileges of the file 
using the Terminal application. This file contains the passphrase you specified when 
you created the keychain. Mail service will automatically use the passphrase file to 
unlock the keychain that contains the SSL certificate. This concludes configuring Mail 
service for automatic SSL connections.
1 Log in to the server as root (if you’re not already logged in as root). 
2 In TextEdit, create a new file and type the passphrase exactly as you entered it when 
you created the keychain. 
Don’t press Return after typing the passphrase.
3 Make the file plain text by choosing Make Plain Text from the Format menu.
4 Save the file, naming it cerkc.pass.
5 Move the file to the root keychain folder.
The path is /private/var/root/Library/Keychains/.
To see the root keychain folder in the Finder, choose Go to Folder from the Go menu, 
then type /private/var/root/Library/Keychains/ and click Go.
6 In the Terminal application, change the access privileges to the passphrase file so only 
root can read and write to this file. 
Do this by typing the following two commands, pressing Return after each one:
cd /private/var/root/Library/Keychains/
chmod 600 certkc.pass
Mail service of Mac OS X Server can now use SSL for secure IMAP connections.
7 Log out as root.
Note:  If Mail service is running, you need to stop it and start it again to make it 
recognize the new certificate keychain.
Setting Up SSL for Mail Service on a Headless Server
If you want to set up SSL for Mail service on a server that doesn’t have a display, first 
follow the instructions in the sections:
• “Generating a CSR and Creating a Keychain” on page 119
• “Obtaining an SSL Certificate” on page 121
• “Importing an SSL Certificate Into the Keychain” on page 121
• “Creating a Passphrase File” on this page
Then copy the keychain file “certkc” and the keychain passphrase file “certkc.pass” to 
the root keychain folder on the headless server. The path on the headless server is 
/private/var/root/Library/Keychains/.
