When attempting to add a Python egg to the Eclipse PyDev interpreter path (via *Eclipse Settings* > *PyDev* > *Interpreter - Python* > *New Egg/Zip(s)*), I encounter an issue on my OS X system with Helios SR 2. Specifically, after browsing to and selecting the egg file, clicking the "Open" button does not close the dialog; instead, it opens and navigates into the egg file as if it were a folder.

A simple workaround for this problem, particularly on OS X, is to add the egg file as a folder using the "New Folder" option. It seems that the "New Egg/Zip" button may be designed for operating systems that do not natively treat .egg or .zip files as folders.
