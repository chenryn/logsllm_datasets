User: I'm trying to add a python egg to my eclipse pydev path via Eclipse Settings -> PyDev -> Interpreter - Python -> New Egg/Zip(s), and in the dialog where I browse to the egg file, and click the "open" button on the dialog, it simply keeps the dialog open and browses into the egg.
This is on OS X with Helios SR 2.
Assistant: Perhaps this only on OS X, but simple solution was to just add the egg as a folder via New Folder.  I'm guessing the New Egg/Zip button is for OS's that don't treat Zips/Eggs as folders.
