which may have led to an underestimation of the number of

Despite these limitations, we were able to perform the ﬁrst em-
pirical, quantitative analysis on cybercriminal security prac-
tices using ground-truth data of on online anonymous market.
We are now able to better understand the patterns of (in)secure
practices of cybercriminal entrepreneurs. Most notably, we
show that among vendors that specialize in trading digital
cybercrime items – of whom it would be assumed to have
their digital security well organized – insecure practices are
most prevalent. These ﬁndings may aid allocating the scarce
resources of law enforcement investigators more effectively,
as they now know that investing in building a case against
seasoned cybercriminal entrepreneurs is anything but impos-
sible.

First and foremost, we are grateful to Dutch law enforcement
for their efforts and trust that ultimately resulted in the unique
opportunity to use the Hansa back-end data for this paper. We
thank our reviewers for their constructive feedback on this
paper. Likewise, we thank Michel van Eeten and Gert-Jan van
Hardeveld for their invaluable comments on earlier versions
of our work.
