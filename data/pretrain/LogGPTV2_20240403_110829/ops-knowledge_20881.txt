User: During the software deployment process, how to ensure the consistency and stability of the version?
Assistant: 1. Version control: Use version control tools (such as Git) to manage code and file change records so that you can quickly find and restore to the correct version. 2. Automated testing: Before deployment, automated testing is performed to ensure that the new version functions as expected and does not break existing functions. 3. Backup and rollback: Before deployment, back up the current system and ensure that it can be quickly rolled back to the previous version. 4. Deployment scripting: Write scripts to automate deployment, ensure the reliability and repeatability of the deployment process, and avoid errors in manual operations. 5. Use containerization technology: Use container technology (such as Docker) to package the application and its dependencies to ensure consistency in different environments. 6. Monitoring and logging: After running a new version, monitor the performance of the system, and record and analyze logs for quick response and debugging of problems.
