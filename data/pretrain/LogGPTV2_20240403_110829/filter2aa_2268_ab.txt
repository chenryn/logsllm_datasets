• Naturally, as closest at bottom of device stack occurs the 
infection (SCSI miniport drivers instead of targeting File 
System Drivers), so more efficient it is. 
• Nowadays, most monitoring tools try to detect strange 
activities at upper layers.
• Malwares try to intercept requests (read / write operations)
from hard disk by manipulating the MajorFunction array 
(IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL and 
IRP_INTERNAL_CONTROL) of the DRIVER_OBJECT 
structure.

• Rootkits try to protect itself from being removed by 
modifying routines such as IRP_MJ DEVICE_CONTROL and 
hooking requests going to the disk (IOCTL_ATA_* and 
IOCTL_SCSI_*). 
• Another easy approach is to hook the DriverUnload( ) 
routine for preventing the rootkit of being unloaded.
• However, any used tricks must avoid touching critical areas 
protected by KPP (Kernel Patch Guard) and one of tricky 
methods for find which are those areas is trying the 
following:

• Most time, malwares have allocated a kind of hidden 
filesytem in free sectors to store configuration files and 
they are referred by random device object names generated 
during the boot.
• Few authors of ring 0 malwares are careless because they 
write malicious drivers that provide access to shared user-
mode buffers using Neither method (METHOD_NEITHER), 
without any data validation, exposing it to memory 
corruption and, most time, leakage of information.
Ridiculous.

Additionally, malwares composed by executable + drivers have 
been using APLC (Advanced Local Procedure Call) in the 
communication between user mode code and kernel drivers 
instead of using only IOCTL commands.  
•
Remember APLC interprocess-communication technique has 
been used  since Windows Vista, as between lsass.exe and SRM( 
Security Reference Monitor). Most analysts are not used to 
seeing this approach. 
•
Malwares do not choose an specific driver during the boot for 
injection, but try to randomly pick up a driver by parsing 
structures such as _KLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY.

Certainly, hooking the filesystem driver access is always a 
possible alternative: 
• IoCreateFile( )  gets a handle to the filesystem.
• ObReferenceObjectByHandle( )  gets a pointer to 
FILE_OBJECT represented by the handle.  
• IoCreateDevice( )  creates a device object 
(DEVICE_OBJECT) for use by a driver.
• IoGetRelatedDeviceObject( )  gets a pointer to 
DEVICE_OBJECT.
• IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack( )  creates a new device 
object and attaches it to DEVICE_OBJECT pointer (previous 
function).

As it is done by AVs, malwares also hook functions such as 
ZwCreate( ) for intercepting all opened requests sent to devices. 
•
After infecting a system by dropping kernel drivers, malwares 
usually force the system reboot calling ZwRaiseHardError( ) 
function and  specifying OptionShutdownSystem as 5th 
parameter. 
•
Of course, it could be worse and the malware could use 
IoRegisterShutdownNotification( ) routine registers the driver to 
receive an IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN IRP notification when the system 
is shutdown for restoring the malicious driver in the next boot 
just in case it is necessary.

MBR modifications (partition table or MBR code) and VBR+IPL 
modifications (BPB or IPL code) have been used as an effective way 
to bypass the KCS. 
•
As injecting code into the Windows kernel has turned out to be a bit 
more complicated, to  modern malwares are used to bypassing the 
KCS (Kernel-Mode Code Signing Policy) by:
• Disabling it  Booting the system on Testing Mode. 
Unfortunately, it is not so trivial because the Secure Boot must 
be disabled previously and, afterwards, it must be rebooted. 
• Changing the kernel memory  MBR and/or VBR could be 
changed. However, as BIOS reads the MBR and handle over the 
execution to the code there, so changing memory could be 
lethal. 
• Even trying to find a flaw in the firmware  it is not trivial and 
the Secure Boot must be disabled.

Malwares infect the bootmgr, which switches the processor 
execution from real mode to protected mode, and use the int 13h 
interrupt to access the disk drive, patch modules and load 
malicious drivers.
•
The winload.exe roles are the following:
• enables the protect mode.
• checks the modules’ integrity and loads the Windows kernel.
• loads the several DLLs (among them, the ci.dll, which is 
responsible for Code Integrity) and ELAM (Early Launch Anti 
Malware, which was introduced on Windows 8 as callback 
methods and tries to prevent any strange code execution in 
the kernel).
• loads drivers and few system registry data.

SMM basics:
• Interesting place to hide malwares because is protected from OS 
and hypervisors.
• The SMM executable code is copied into SMRAM and locked during 
the initialization. 
• To switch to SMM, it is necessary to triger a SMI (System 
Management Interrupt), save the current content into SMRAM and 
execute the SMI handler code. 
• A SMI could be generated from a driver (ring 0) by writing a value 
into APMC I/O / port B2h or using a I/O instruction restart CPU 
feature. 
• The return (and execution of the prior execution) is done by using 
RSM instruction.
