follows from [10] that for a function f , the product x (cid:1) r is
a hardcore bit, i.e. it cannot be guessed with non-negligible
advantage by any PPT adversary, given (f; f (x); r), if r 2R
f0; 1gn and x belongs to a distribution such that f is one-
way (i.e. hard to invert).
Then, the hardcore bit encryption of a plaintext bit b, giv-
en a trapdoor function f and a properly distributed x, pro-
ceeds by generating (x; r) for a uniformly random r and com-
puting a ciphertext as the triple (b + (x (cid:1) r); f (x); r), where
\+" is an exclusive-or. Clearly, without the trapdoor, b is
as hard to guess as the hardcore bit of f .
3There exists a constant-round (information-theoretic) I-
H protocol [5, Sec. 5] with roughly the same communica-
tion cost. However, its security requirements are somewhat
stricter compared to ours, so that we cannot use it in our
schemes. On the positive side, this result shows that im-
provements for IT-IH are possible in principle.

3. EFFICIENT OT FROM TRAPDOOR
PERMUTATIONS
Let us assume a secure (according to Def. 3) implemen-
tation of C-IH (in this section, we refer to it as \IH" for
short) to be available as a black-box. Let ffi : f0; 1gn !
f0; 1gngi∈I be a TDP collection according to Def. 1. Let us
de(cid:12)ne by f h
i (x; b) a hardcore bit encryption (as described in
the previous section) of a bit b using a permutation fi as
trapdoor function and some x 2 f0; 1gn.
S has inputs b0; b1 2R f0; 1g, R has no input.
Protocol 1.
1. S picks i 2R I and the corresponding trapdoor t,
then sends i to R.
2. a) R generates x 2R f0; 1gn and computes y = fi(x).
b) R inputs y to IH, such that both S and R obtain
(y0; y1) as output of IH, where the output strings are
assigned to yj according to lexicographic order.

3. a) For j = 0; 1 : S uses t to compute xj = f
i
(yj) and
sends f h
b) R computes c = fjjyj = yg, decrypts bc and outputs
(c; bc).
i (xj; bj) to R.
The proof of the following proposition can be found in the
full version of this paper [19].
Proposition 1. Protocol 1 is a secure implementation of
1-2 OT according to De(cid:12)nition 4 with information-theoretic
receiver-security, assuming that trapdoor permutations as de-
scribed in Sec. 2.1 exist.
Protocol 1 itself has one round, plus n (cid:0) 1 rounds are
contributed by the IH protocol, which is n rounds in total.
The lower bound of (cid:2)(n= log n) rounds for oblivious transfer
based on TDP in black-box manner is established in [14,
Sec. 7.3]. Hence, our protocol has a near-optimal round
complexity.
Taking into account the work [17] which shows the proof
of [20] to work for a modi(cid:12)cation of C-IH with round com-
plexity O(n= log n), we believe but do not prove formally,
that our protocol can be shown round-optimal.
4. OT FROM CODING ASSUMPTIONS
Let us assume a secure (according to Def. 2) implemen-
tation of IT-IH (in this section, we call it \IH" for short) to
be available as a black-box. When a binary matrix is input
into IH, it is represented as a bit string by concatenating the
rows. Denote the standard part of a generating k(cid:2) n matrix
M by St(M ) 2 f0; 1gk×n−k. Let Encpk(b) be a hardcore bit
encryption (according to Sec. 2.5) of a bit b where the trap-
door function is the McEliece encryption having a public key
pk 2 P K. The string x is generated uniformly at random
by the encrypting player, its mentioning is omitted for the
sake of notation simplicity.
The sender S has inputs b0; b1 2R f0; 1g, the receiver R has
no input. Both players agree on a default value v 2 f0; 1g.
Protocol 2.
1. a) R generates a random pk 2 P K, computes St(pk)
and inputs the latter into IH, then both S and R obtain
outputs which are assigned to (w0; w1) according to
lexicographic order.
b) For i = 0; 1: Both players parse wi as an element of
f0; 1gk×n−k and compute Ki = [Ikjwi].
2. For i = 0; 1: S sends EncKi (bi) to R.
R computes c = fijKi = pkg and decrypts bc.
If the decryption outputs \failure", then Bob outputs
(c; v). Otherwise (in case of success) he outputs (c; bc).
The proof of the following proposition can be found in the
full version of this paper [19].
Proposition 2. Protocol 2 is a secure implementation of
1-2 OT according to De(cid:12)nition 4 under Assumptions 1-3.
IT-IH requires O(m2) bits of communication
E(cid:14)ciency.
and (cid:2)(m2) rounds for m-bit inputs. Plugging it into Proto-
col 2 yields O(n4) bits of communication cost. Given that
the typical n is at least 1024 bits, our protocol turns out to
be of strictly theoretical interest.
