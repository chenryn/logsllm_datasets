**Question:**
Is there a way to enhance the IntelliSense-like functionality in Eclipse for Python development, beyond the default settings? I am currently using Eclipse 3.5 with Aptana and PyDev, and my Python interpreter is version 2.5.2.

**Answer:**
To improve the IntelliSense-like functionality in Eclipse with Aptana and PyDev, you can add references to specific libraries (such as .egg files) to the system PYTHONPATH. This can be done through the Preferences menu. Here are the steps:

1. Open Eclipse.
2. Go to **Preferences**.
3. Navigate to **PyDev** > **Interpreter - Python**.
4. Select the **Libraries** tab on the right.
5. Add the path to the .egg file or any other library you want to include.

While this method should work for many libraries, it may not be universally compatible with all of them. If you encounter any issues, please ensure that the paths and library versions are correctly specified.
