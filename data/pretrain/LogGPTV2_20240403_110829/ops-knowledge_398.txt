User: Does anyone know how to get an intellisense like functionality (better than default) in eclipse for python development? I am using Eclipse 3.5 with aptana and pydev and the interpreter is python 2.5.2
Assistant: In Aptana I added the reference to the .egg file to the system PYTHONPATH in Preferences menu. I am not sure if this works for every library out there.
Preferences --> PyDev --> Interpreter Python --> Libraries tab on the right.
