User: You need to use the Linux operating system to complete a series of system monitoring and performance optimization tasks, such as viewing system running status, monitoring network connections, analyzing process status, optimizing system resources, etc. Please provide a list of operations, including commonly used Linux commands and tools .
Assistant: The following is a list of operations for Linux system monitoring and performance optimization: 1. View system information - uname: display operating system information - lsb_release: display system version information - free: display memory usage - df: display disk space usage - top: Display various indicators of the system in real time, such as CPU, memory, process, etc. 2. Monitor network connection - netstat: display network connection status - ss: display more detailed network connection information - ifconfig: display detailed information of network interface - tcpdump: capture Package tool, used to capture network packets and analyze them 3. Analyze process status - ps: display the processes running in the system - top: display the process information of the system in real time - htop: a more intuitive process monitoring tool, which can easily view the process - kill: the process can be terminated by PID 4. Optimize system resources - renice: adjust the priority of the process - nice: start the process with a different priority - ulimit: is the command to set the resource limit of the process under Linux - top/ htop: You can view the CPU and memory usage of the process, so as to adjust or terminate the process that occupies a large resource. In addition, there are many other commonly used performance analysis tools under the Linux system, such as: - iostat: displays the I/O usage of the disk - vmstat: displays the virtual memory usage of the system - sar: can perform performance analysis and statistics on the system - strace: It can track information such as system calls and signals of the process. The above commands and tools can help administrators effectively monitor and optimize the performance of the Linux system, and improve the stability and reliability of the system.
