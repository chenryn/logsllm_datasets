 "A": "Trigger `vold.decrypt trigger_reset_main`, then `vold` sets `vold.encrypt_progress` to a percentage value."
 "B": "Set `vold.decrypt trigger_encryption`, then `vold` sets `vold.post_fs_data_done` to 1."
 "C": "`vold` receives the command `cryptfs changepw` and re-encrypts the disk master key with the new password."
 "D": "Set `vold.decrypt trigger_restart_min_framework`, then `vold` sets `ro.crypto.state encrypted`."
