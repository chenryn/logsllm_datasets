### Image Comparison Approach for Photo Identification

To identify photos within our collection, we employ a method that involves cropping the top left corners of the presented photos and matching them to the corresponding areas in the photos from our collection. While this approach may sometimes result in false positives (e.g., if the top left corner contains only black pixels), it did not significantly affect our success rate. Table 1 presents the results of our experiments, showing the average ratio of correctly identified photos in each SA challenge (21 photos). We successfully passed all challenges by identifying at least 18 out of 21 photos, achieving an identification rate of at least 98.4% in all scenarios.

Our approach is highly efficient, as we can identify 21 photos within a collection of 40,000 photos in just 1.24 seconds (approximately 0.06 seconds per photo). Performance could be further enhanced by intersecting the suggested names with the tags after each photo is identified on a page. This could reduce processing times, as the tags from one photo might provide enough information to infer the correct answer.

### Measuring User Abilities

To design a secure Social Authentication (SA) system that leverages noisy and unidentifiable faces, we need to confirm that humans can recognize their friends in photos taken under natural conditions. Although previous studies [12, 22] have explored the ability of people to discern human faces or their features, we are the first to focus on the ability to recognize friends, even when the faces are unclear or absent.

#### Measurement Application

We developed a Facebook app that replicates the SA mechanism, requiring users to identify their friends in SA challenges and complete a questionnaire for each photo. We chose a Facebook app for two reasons: first, it instills trust in users as it operates within a sandbox and is governed by permissions that clearly state the user data accessed. Second, a Facebook app provides direct access to user profile data (e.g., social circle), allowing us to respect user privacy and minimize the collection of potentially sensitive information.

#### IRB Approval

We submitted an Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol request to our institution's review board, detailing the study parameters and the data we would collect. After approval, we invited users to participate.

#### Recruiting Users

We initially considered using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to reach human subjects. However, AMT's terms of service prohibit directing workers to external URLs or requiring them to install apps. Due to this technical incompatibility, we recruited users directly by sharing our app with our personal Facebook contacts and posting flyers around the university campus. We also offered prizes as an incentive for participation. This allowed us to collect and analyze significant user data, including over 4 million photos and more than 1,000 solved SA challenges.

### Measurement Workflow

1. **Face Extraction**: We use the face.com online service, now part of Facebook, to detect faces in the collected photos. The service returns two key metrics:
   - **Confidence**: The level of confidence that the tagged area contains a face.
   - **Recognizable**: A boolean value indicating whether the face can be recognized or used for training a classifier.

2. **Photo Categorization**:
   - **Simple**: Photos with high confidence (≥80%) and recognizable faces.
   - **Medium**: Photos with high confidence (≥80%) but not suitable for recognition (recognizable=F).
   - **Difficult**: Photos with low confidence (<40%), often with no visible face.

3. **Photo Description**: After selecting the name of each depicted friend, users are informed if they were correct and asked to answer four questions about the photo's content, the position and visibility of the user’s face, and other relevant details.

### User Study Results

Our goal was to measure users' ability to recognize their friends and demonstrate that humans can solve this task even when automated attacks fail. 

- **Dataset and Demographics**: 141 users installed our app, leading to a total of 4,457,829 photos and 5,087,034 tags. 90 users completed challenges, with 79 males and 11 females from 6 different countries. On average, users had 347 friends each.

- **Recognizing Friends**: Table 2 shows the number of challenges per category and the percentage of successful identifications. Users performed exceptionally well, solving over 99% of medium challenges and 82% of difficult challenges.

- **Influence of Social Circle Size**: Figure 2 shows the correlation between the number of friends and the success rate for solving SA challenges. Despite the increase in the number of friends, there was no significant drop in performance, suggesting that the suggestion of names is crucial for decision-making.

- **Photo Content and Face Position**: Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the distribution of answers regarding the content and placement of the friend’s face. For simple and medium categories, over 80% of photos were labeled as portraits, while for the difficult category, only 37% were portraits.

- **Presence of Other Faces and Usefulness of the Photo**: Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show the distribution of other faces and the usefulness of the photos. Users relied on various visual clues and context to exclude or infer suggested names, even in the absence of the friend’s face.

- **Absolute Success Rate per Category**: Table 3 shows the success rates for pages where all three photos are assigned to the same category. Users achieved high success rates, even in the difficult category, validating our approach.

- **Absence of Friend’s Face**: Figure 4 breaks down the success rates for photos where the friend’s face was absent. Users were able to infer the correct answer based on the relevance of the content, achieving high success rates even in the difficult category.

- **Total Absence of Faces**: We explored whether the presence of other people in the photo influenced the results. Even when the requested friend was not in the photo, users still achieved high accuracy, especially in the simple and medium categories.

These results demonstrate that humans can effectively recognize their friends in photos, even under challenging conditions, making our SA system robust and reliable.
