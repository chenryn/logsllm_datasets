# G0053: FIN5
## Description
FIN5 is a financially motivated threat group that has been active since at least 2008. The group primarily targets personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card information, with a focus on the restaurant, gaming, and hotel industries. It is believed that the members of this group are likely Russian-speaking. (Citations: FireEye Respond Webinar July 2017, Mandiant FIN5 GrrCON Oct 2016, DarkReading FireEye FIN5 Oct 2015)

## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
| Platform | Tactic | Technique | Description | Data Sources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux, macOS, Windows, AWS, GCP, Azure, SaaS, Office 365 | Defense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access | [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/) | FIN5 uses legitimate credentials for VPN, RDP, Citrix, or VNC to maintain access to victim environments. | AWS CloudTrail logs, Stackdriver logs, Authentication logs, Process monitoring |
| Windows, Linux, macOS | Credential Access | [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/) | FIN5 dumps credentials from victims, often using the tool GET5 Penetrator to identify remote login and hard-coded credentials. | API monitoring, Process monitoring, PowerShell logs, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Defense Evasion, Execution | [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064/) | FIN5 scans processes on all victim systems and uses automated scripts to gather and report results. | Process monitoring, File monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows, AWS, GCP, Azure, Office 365, SaaS, Azure AD | Defense Evasion, Persistence | [Redundant Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1108/) | FIN5 maintains access by using valid accounts to access external remote services and establishing a backup RDP tunnel with FLIPSIDE. | Office 365 account logs, Azure activity logs, AWS CloudTrail logs, Stackdriver logs, Process monitoring, Network protocol analysis, File monitoring, Authentication logs, Binary file metadata |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Defense Evasion | [File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1107/) | FIN5 uses SDelete to clean up the environment and attempt to prevent detection. | File monitoring, Process command-line parameters, Binary file metadata |
| Linux, macOS, Windows, GCP, Azure, AWS | Discovery | [Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018/) | FIN5 uses Essential NetTools to map the network and build a list of targets. | Network protocol analysis, Process monitoring, Process use of network, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Defense Evasion | [Indicator Removal on Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/) | FIN5 clears event logs from victims to remove indicators of their presence. | File monitoring, Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters, API monitoring, Windows event logs |
| Linux, macOS, Windows, AWS, GCP, Azure | Collection | [Data Staged](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/) | FIN5 scripts save memory dump data into specific directories on hosts in the victim environment. | File monitoring, Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Windows | Persistence, Initial Access | [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/) | FIN5 uses legitimate credentials for VPN, Citrix, or VNC to maintain access to victim environments. | Authentication logs |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Collection | [Automated Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/) | FIN5 scans processes on all victim systems and uses automated scripts to gather and report results. | File monitoring, Data loss prevention, Process command-line parameters |

This table provides a detailed overview of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by FIN5, along with the relevant data sources for detecting and mitigating these activities.
