### 4% Recycling Rate

**Owner Domain Migration:**
From our interactions with the BPH (Bullet Proof Hosting) ecosystem, we observed that service providers and their subsidiaries, such as "ColoCrossing," occasionally group multiple resellers within the same sub-allocation. Additionally, when IP addresses are blacklisted, clients are often moved between sub-allocations. To identify resellers and track these migrations, we leverage a list of TLD+3 (Top-Level Domains plus three levels) hosted on detected sub-allocations, following their movements across different time intervals.

**Methodology:**
In three of our purchases from BPH services, we identified migrated TLD+3 domains. We then constructed a graph \( G = (V, E) \) where:
- \( V \) represents the set of nodes, each corresponding to a sub-allocation.
- An edge is created between two sub-allocations if more than 50% of one sub-allocation's TLD+3 set migrates to the other.

Using the Python package NetworkX [37], we generated connected components, where each component represents a group of TLD+3 moving together between at least two sub-allocations. This process identified 592 groups, with a sample of 5 groups provided in Table XV, showing a migration velocity of 1 day per sub-allocation.

The top-moving group spanned 35 sub-allocations and primarily served Command and Control (CnC) functions. Two other groups of moving TLD+3 shared a common domain pattern (e.g., 713811.xyz & 939211.xyz) and lasted for over a year. This suggests they are more likely private customers of the service provider rather than BPH services, as BPH typically involves a variety of patterns due to multiple clients.

### BPH Clients

**Analysis:**
We studied BPH clients by analyzing the complete set of TLD+3 domains hosted on detected sub-allocations. We collected a total of 260M TLD+3, with 87.7% having an average life of 1 day, indicating the prevalence of fast fluxing to evade blacklisting. Using our commercial blacklist, BL-A, described in Section III-B, we found that 115K TLD+3 domains were present on this blacklist. Table XVI shows that 50% of the blacklisted domains were used to distribute malware or spyware, and 46% were running botnet CnC servers. While this blacklist focuses on these activities, it provides a glimpse into the malicious activities of BPH clients.

**Client Domain Migration:**
To track client movements between sub-allocations and sometimes even between BPH services, we followed TLD+3 movements over the detected set of sub-allocations. Due to the large processing cost, we partially processed the data and found that 1.6M TLD+3 had migrated between at least two sub-allocations. Table XVII highlights five selected TLD+3 that hopped between at least 10 sub-allocations and lasted for months. On average, moving TLD+3 hopped 3 detected sub-allocations (with a maximum of 10) and had an average life of 6.7 months.

### Discussion

**Limitations:**
- **Ground Truth:** One of the primary limitations is the lack of ground truth information about which sub-allocations are controlled by BPH services and the extent of malicious activity. We validated our classifier using high-quality labeled lists, but these may be biased towards extreme cases. Our classifier performs well on these lists but worse on noisier sets, making it difficult to measure true precision and recall.
- **Scope of Detection:** Our classifier focuses on detecting maliciousness within sub-allocated network blocks, based on anecdotal reports and our analysis. It is challenging to understand the overall recall of BPH infrastructure, but we are detecting a significant number of likely malicious network blocks.
- **Robustness of Detection:** Detecting adaptive adversaries requires robust features. We considered robustness in feature selection, such as network utilization and domain churn, which would increase costs or decrease abuse rates for BPH services. However, high recycling rates and complicit service providers make detection more difficult.

**Ethical Concerns:**
To study potential illicit activities, we conducted two types of purchasing: reseller packages and BPH hosting. We ensured no harm was done to legitimate service providers and only paid for extremely interesting targets that did not offer free trials. Our purchasing activity was reviewed and approved by The University of Indiana.

**Future Work:**
We plan to explore more effective and timely detection approaches, leveraging Whois data, recycling patterns, and re-branding. The goal is to create a system that can predict, at sub-allocation registration time, whether a sub-allocation will be benign or malicious.

### Related Work

**Sub-Allocations:**
To our knowledge, there has been no prior academic work on using IP address sub-allocation information to detect malicious IP blocks at the sub-ASN level. Mahjoub from OpenDNS presented systems like Marauder [35] and SPRank [39], but details are limited. Our work presents a detailed methodology and evaluation of a machine learning-based system for detecting malicious sub-allocated network blocks.

**Detecting Malicious AS:**
Several methods have been proposed for detecting malicious Autonomous Systems (ASes), including Fire [13] and ASwatch [7]. We used AS ranking as a feature in our detection system, but these systems alone cannot produce a network block-based detection model. We identified new features tailored to detecting fine-grained malicious sub-allocated network blocks.

**Legitimate Service Providers Abuse:**
Poorly managed service providers can also be sources of concentrated abuse. Studies by Collins et al. [44] and Zhang et al. [45] have shown correlations between misconfiguration and abusive activity. We attempted to avoid detecting compromised infrastructure, but it remains a challenge.

**Fast Fluxing:**
Corona et al. [48] used passive DNS features to detect fast-fluxed domain names. We leveraged similar features in our study to identify fast-fluxing, which is a common evasion technique.
