### Table VII: Comparison of Coconut with Other Relevant Cryptographic Constructions

| **Construction** | **Aggregability** |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Coconut**      | Aggregable        |
| **Construction 1** | Not Aggregable   |
| **Construction 2** | Not Aggregable   |
| **Construction 3** | Aggregable       |
| **Construction 4** | Aggregable       |
| **Construction 5** | Not Aggregable   |

**Note:** The aggregability of the signature scheme is indicated as follows:
- **Aggregable**: The construction supports signature aggregation.
- **Not Aggregable**: The construction does not support signature aggregation.

### Elements in Each Construction
- **Construction 1**: 2 Elements
- **Construction 2**: 2 Elements
- **Construction 3**: 1 Element
- **Construction 4**: O(q) Elements
- **Construction 5**: O(v) Elements
- **Coconut**: 2 Elements

This table provides a clear comparison of the aggregability and the number of elements in each cryptographic construction, highlighting the key differences between Coconut and other relevant schemes.
