Mode Privileged EXEC mode or global configuration mode
Usage To list the options available for a clear command, enter ? after the command name. For
example, to display the clear gslb options, enter the following command:
clear gslb ?
On some ACOS models, entering either the clear slb switch or clear slb l4
command clears all anomaly counters for both show slb switch and show slb l4. This
applies to the following AX models: AX 3200-12, AX 3400, and AX3530.
Note on Clearing Sessions
After entering the clear session command, the ACOS device may remain in session-clear
mode for up to 10 seconds. During this time, any new connections are sent to the delete
queue for clearing.
Example The following command clears the counters on Ethernet interface 3:
ACOS#clear statistics interface ethernet 3
clock
Description Set the system time and date.
Syntax clock set time day month year
Parameter Description
time Set the time, using 24-hour format hh:mm:ss.
day Set the day of the month (1-31).
month Set the month (January, February, March, and so on).
year Set the year (2013, 2014, and so on).
Mode Privileged EXEC mode
Usage Use this command to manually set the system time and date.

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
If the system clock is adjusted while OSPF or IS-IS is enabled, the routing protocols may stop
working properly. To work around this issue, disable OSPF and IS-IS before adjusting the
system clock.
Example Set the system clock to 5:51 p.m. and the date to February 22nd, 2015.
ACOS#clock set 17:51:00 22 February 2015
configure
Description Enter the configuration mode from the Privileged EXEC mode.
Syntax configure [terminal]
Mode Privileged EXEC mode
Example Enter configuration mode.
ACOS#configure
ACOS(config)#
debug
NOTE: It is recommended to use the AXdebug subsystem instead of these debug com-
mands. See “AX Debug Commands” on page365.
diff
Description Display a side-by-side comparison of the commands in a pair of locally stored configurations.
Syntax diff {startup-config | profile-name} {running-config | profile-name}
Default N/A
Mode Privileged EXEC mode
Usage The following command compares the configuration profile that is currently linked to
“startup-config” with the running-config.
diff startup-config running-config
Similarly, the following command compares the configuration profile that is currently linked
to “startup-config” with the specified configuration profile:
diff startup-config profile-name
To compare a configuration profile other than the startup-config to the running-config,
enter the configuration profile name instead of startup-config.
To compare any two configuration profiles, enter their profile names instead of startup-
config or running-config.

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
In the CLI output, the commands in the first profile name you specify are listed on the left
side of the terminal screen. The commands in the other profile that differ from the
commands in the first profile are listed on the right side of the screen, across from the
commands they differ from. The following flags indicate how the two profiles differ:
• | – This command has different settings in the two profiles.
• > – This command is in the second profile but not in the first one.
• 
NOTE: The prompt changes from # to >, indicating change to EXEC mode.
exit
Description Exit the Privileged EXEC mode and enter the EXEC Mode.
Syntax exit
Mode Privileged EXEC mode
Example In the following example, the exit command is used to exit the Privileged EXEC mode level
and return to the User EXEC level of the CLI:
ACOS#exit
ACOS>
NOTE: The prompt changes from # to >, indicating change to EXEC mode.

xml-schema Exports an XML schema file.
profile-name Name of a startup-config profile to export.
use-mgmt-port Uses the management interface as the source interface for the
connection to the remote device. The management route
table is used to reach the device. By default, the ACOS device
attempts to use the data route table to reach the remote
device through a data interface.
url Protocol, user name (if required), and directory path you want
to use to send the file.
You can enter the entire URL on the command line or press
Enter to display a prompt for each part of the URL. If you enter
the entire URL and a password is required, you will still be
prompted for the password. The password can be up to 255
characters long.
To enter the entire URL:
• tftp://host/file
• ftp://[user@]host[:port]/file
• scp://[user@]host/file
• sftp://[user@]host/file
Mode Privileged EXEC mode or global configuration mode
Usage If you omit the final forward slash in the url string, ACOS attempts to use the string after the
final slash as the filename. If you omit the extension, ACOS attempts to use the string after
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 44
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
the final slash as the base name of the file. However, this can lead to an error in some cases. If
you are exporting AXdebug output, make sure to use the final slash in the url string.
Due to a limitation in Windows, it is recommended to use names shorter than 255
characters. Windows allows a maximum of 256 characters for both the file name and the
directory path. If the combination of directory path and file name is too long, Windows will
not recognize the file. This limitation is not present on machines running Linux/Unix.
Example The following command exports an aFleX policy from the ACOS device to an FTP server, to a
directory named “backups”.
ACOS# export aflex aflex-01 ftp://192.168.1.101/backups/aflex-01
