User: I have 10,000 binary files, named like this:
file0.bin
file1.bin
............
............
file10000.bin
Each of the above files contains exactly 391 float values (1564 bytes per file).
my goal is to read all of the files into a python array in the fastest way possible. If I open & close each file using a script, it takes a lot of time (about 8min!). 
are there any other creative ways to read these files FAST? 
I am using Ubuntu Linux and would prefer a solution that can work with Python. Thanks.
Assistant: Iterate over them and use optimise flag you might also want to parse them using pypy it compiles python via a JIT compiler allowing for a somewhat marked increase in speed.
