Enterprise email solutions often include monitoring mechanisms that can audit auto-forwarding rules on a regular basis. In an Exchange environment, administrators can use the following PowerShell cmdlets to discover and remove potentially malicious auto-forwarding and transport rules:

- `Get-InboxRule` and `Remove-InboxRule`
- `Get-TransportRule` and `Remove-TransportRule`

Additionally, a MAPI Editor can be used to examine the underlying database structure and detect any modifications or tampering of the properties of auto-forwarding rules.
