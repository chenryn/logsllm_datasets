# Introduction to CTF (Capture the Flag)

## Traditional Course Practice
Traditional cybersecurity courses often focus heavily on theory and basic concepts, with less emphasis on practical, hands-on experience. This approach can be limiting, as it does not fully prepare students for real-world scenarios.

## Offensive Thinking
Offensive thinking is a critical component of cybersecurity. It involves adopting the mindset of a hacker to understand and anticipate potential attacks. This includes understanding the overall attack lifecycle, which typically consists of the following stages:

- **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target.
- **Gaining Access**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain entry.
- **Maintaining Access**: Ensuring persistent control over the compromised system.
- **Clearing Tracks**: Erasing evidence of the attack.

However, traditional methods often involve tedious and complex tasks, making them less effective for training.

## The Alternative: CTF (Capture the Flag)
CTF competitions are an alternative and more engaging way to train in offensive security. They offer several benefits:

- **Spread Security Techniques**: Participants learn and share various security techniques.
- **Measure Security Skills**: Competitions provide a way to measure and improve one's skills.
- **Practical Experience**: CTFs emphasize hands-on practice, emulating real-world problems.
- **Realistic Environment**: The competition environment closely mimics real-world conditions.
- **Focus on Advanced Skills**: CTFs eliminate mundane tasks, allowing participants to focus on advanced security skills.

### What is a CTF?
A CTF is a competition where participants attempt to steal data, known as a "flag," from other computers. For example, a common challenge might involve stealing an admin password from a web server. Most CTF challenges are related to information security and are excellent practice for both students and experts.

### History of CTF
- **Defcon 4 (1996)**: The first CTF was held at Defcon 4 in 1996.
- **UCSB iCTF (2001)**: The first CTF organized by an academic institution, UCSB, was held in 2001.

## CTF Around the World
To enhance the education of offensive security, CTFs are held in many countries. Some notable examples include:

- **United States**: DEFCON, Ghost In the Shellcode, PlaidCTF
- **Japan**: SECCON, TMCTF, MMACTF
- **Korea**: CodeGate, SECUINSIDE
- **China**: XCTF, BCTF, 0CTF
- **Russia**: RuCTF
- **France**: Nuit du Hack
- **Malaysia**: HITB CTF
- **Colombia**: Backdoor CTF

## CTFTime
- **Founded in 2010 by kyprizel (MSLC)**: A centralized ranking and statistics website for CTFs.

## Trend of CTFs
- **CTF Contests**: The number of CTF contests has grown from fewer than 10 in 2010 to over 50 in 2014.
- **CTF Teams**: There were more than 6,000 teams participating in CTFs in 2014.
- **Famous Teams**:
  - **PPP (US, CMU)**
  - **HITCON (TW)**
  - **217 (TW, NTU)**
  - **0ops (China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University)**
  - **Blue-Lotus (China, Tsinghua University)**
  - **Dragon Sector (Poland)**
  - **Gallopsled (Denmark)**
  - **Shellphish (US, UCSB)**
  - **DEFKOR (Korea)**

## Why CTF?
- **Practice Hacking Skills**: CTFs provide a platform to practice and hone hacking skills.
- **Compete with Top Hackers**: Participants can compete with some of the best hackers in the world.

## Types of CTFs
### Jeopardy
- **Problem Classification**: Challenges are categorized into different disciplines such as Pwn, Reverse Engineering, Web Security, Forensics, and Cryptography.
- **Scoring**: More difficult problems are worth more points.
- **Popularity**: About 90% of CTFs follow the Jeopardy style.
- **Format**: Can be held online, allowing hundreds of teams to participate.

### Attack & Defense
- **Environment**: Competitors are placed in a closed environment and must attack each other's servers.
- **Tasks**: Teams need to patch their own vulnerabilities while exploiting those of other teams.
- **Skills Required**: Vulnerability discovery and patching, network flow analysis, system administration, and backdoor creation.
- **Examples**: iCTF, RuCTF, CTCTF, Defcon Final, HITCON Final, SECCON Final.

### King of the Hill
- **Objective**: Competitors must compromise and maintain control of provided servers.
- **Scoring**: The longer a team controls a server, the more points they earn.
- **Realism**: Mimics real-world cyber warfare, where teams must both attack and defend.

## Choosing the Right CTF
- **Beginner CTFs**: Backdoor, CSAW Qualification, ASIS
- **Advanced CTFs**: DEFCON, PlaidCTF, PPP, CodeGate (Korea), SECCON (Japan), PHD Qals

With over 100 CTFs held annually, there is a wide range of options to choose from, catering to all skill levels.

## Tips for CTF Success
### Focus
- **Specialize**: Start by focusing on one type of problem, such as Pwn, Reverse, or Web.
- **Concentration**: Work on one problem at a time during the competition.

### Follow New Techniques
- **Stay Updated**: Hackers and CTF organizers often use new techniques.
- **Resources**: Follow sources like Freebuf, Reddit Hacking, NetSec, and ReverseEngineering channels.

### Customize Your Toolset
- **Environment**: Prepare your own environment with your favorite tools.
- **Efficiency**: Customize and refine your toolset after each CTF.
- **Writeups**: Document your solutions and experiences.

### Review Problems
- **Post-CTF**: Review problems you were unable to solve during the competition.
- **Read Writeups**: Learn from the solutions provided by others.

### Practice, Practice, Practice
- **Experience and Proficiency**: These are key to success in CTFs.
- **Continuous Learning**: Regular practice helps you find the right approaches and try more methods.

### Enjoy the Game
- **Stay Calm**: Don't panic; keep calm and carry on.
