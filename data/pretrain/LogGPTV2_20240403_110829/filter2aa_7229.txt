# CVE-2022-22978: Spring Security Authorization Bypass in RegexRequestMatcher

### Vulnerability Overview
In Spring Security versions 5.5.6, 5.6.3, and older unsupported versions, the `RegexRequestMatcher` can be misconfigured, leading to an authorization bypass on certain servlet containers. Specifically, applications that use `RegexRequestMatcher` with a regular expression containing a `.` (dot) character are potentially vulnerable to this issue.

1. Send the following request to access the admin page:
   - **Method**: GET

By following these steps, you can verify if your application is vulnerable to the authorization bypass in `RegexRequestMatcher`.

### Mitigation
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that the `RegexRequestMatcher` is properly configured and avoid using regular expressions with a `.` (dot) character unless absolutely necessary. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Spring Security, which may include fixes for this and other security issues.
