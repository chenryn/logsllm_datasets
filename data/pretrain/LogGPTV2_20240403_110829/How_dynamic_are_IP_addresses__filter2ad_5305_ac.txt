Figure 5(a) and (b) show the cumulative fraction of the UDmap
IP block sizes. We observe a few instances containing very large
blocks. The rest of the cases, speciﬁcally 95% of all blocks, have
fewer than 256 hosts. We also plot in Figure 5(a) the CDF of the
dynamic IP block sizes reported by Dynablock [7]. Despite the
similarity of the two curve shapes, Dynablock IP block sizes tend
to be larger, with only 50% of the blocks having fewer than 256 IP
addresses.

The reason we see smaller UDmap block sizes is the sporadic
usage of IPs within a large range. The infrequent usage of certain
IPs forces the multi-user block selection process to split the large
ranges into smaller ones. In particular, over 95% of the multi-user
blocks have fewer than 256 IP addresses. A longer-term trace can
be expected to contain more usage of dynamic IP addresses over a
larger space and hence larger blocks.
Finally, Figure 5(b) shows the block size CDF for the identi-
ﬁed proxy IP addresses. Most of the proxy blocks are small, with
95% of blocks having fewer than 32 hosts. Knowledge of proxy
clusters can be very helpful, as proxies often need to be treated dif-
ferently than normal hosts in various applications. For example,
applications that rate limit host connections might prefer to choose
a higher threshold for connections coming from proxies.
5.3 Validation
It is difﬁcult to verify whether UDmap IPs are indeed dynamic
ones, mainly because ISPs and system administrators consider de-
tailed IP address properties as sensitive, proprietary information
and hence do not publish or share with others. As discussed in Sec-
tion 2.1, to date, the best information about dynamic IP addresses
comes from two major sources: reverse DNS (rDNS) lookups and
Dynablock database [7]. Both of these sources require dedicated,
manual maintenance and update. Even so, they are far from being
comprehensive to provide a complete list of dynamic IP addresses.
In the lack of better data sources for verifying dynamic IP ad-
dresses on a global scale, we use combined information from both
rDNS and Dynablock for validation.
First, we compare UDmap IPs with the IP addresses maintained
by Dynablock (referred to as Dynablock IP). We consider six cases
when comparing the list of UDmap IP blocks {A1, A2, A3, . . .}
with the list of Dynablock IP blocks {B1, B2, B3, . . .}. Table 2
shows, for each case, the number of blocks and the corresponding
percentages of IP addresses.
Case 1 (identical): The block returned by UDmap has the ex-
act same address boundaries as a block from Dynablock. A small
fraction (0.11%) of UDmap IPs fall into this case.
Case 2 (subset): The identiﬁed UDmap block is a subset of ad-
dresses from a Dynablock block, and 47.93% of UDmap IPs fall
into this category. The main reason that UDmap failed to ﬁnd the
rest of dynamic IP addresses is their insufﬁcient usage in our data.
We ﬁnd 47.6% of the missed IPs did not appear in the trace, and the
rest 52.4% appeared but were used infrequently, with the average
number of users per IP being 1.72.
Case 3 (superset): The UDmap IP block is larger than the cor-
responding Dynablock IP block. Only 1.60% of UDmap IPs fall
into this category. Many UDmap IP blocks in this category are sig-
niﬁcantly larger than the corresponding Dynablock IP blocks. We
suspect that these IPs beyond the Dynablock IP ranges are also dy-
namic ones, but not reported to Dynablock. Later in the section, we
verify these IP addresses using rDNS lookups.
Case 4 (new): These are UDmap IP blocks not listed in Dyn-
ablock. These blocks consist of a large fraction of UDmap IPs
(48.06%) and we also verify them through rDNS lookups.

Table 3: Random sampling based rDNS lookup results
Case 5 (missed): UDmap failed to identify any dynamic IP ad-
dress from an entire Dynablock block. Only 5.78% of such missed
IPs appeared in our data, with an average number of users per IP
being 0.58. Hence these addresses are also used infrequently.
Case 6 (partially overlap): UDmap IP blocks and Dynablock
IP blocks partially overlap with each other. This excludes Case
1-3. Only 2.3% of UDmap IPs belong to this case.
After comparing with the Dynablock IP list, we can verify 49.81%
of the UDmap IP addresses.
For the remaining 50.19% of the UDmap IPs that are not seen
by Dynablock, we verify them through rDNS lookups. Due to the
large number of addresses and thus the lookup queries involved,
we use two methods to sample the identiﬁed IP addresses: ran-
dom sampling and block-based sampling, and we perform rDNS
lookups on only the sampled addresses. The random sampling
method randomly picks 1% of the remaining UDmap IP addresses
that are not in Dynablock. The block-based sampling assumes that
IP addresses within a same block should be of the same type. So
this method picks one IP address from each UDmap block only.
Based on the returned host names, we can then infer whether the
looked up IP is a dynamic address by checking if the host name
contains conventional keywords used for dynamic IP addresses,
such as dial-up, dsl, etc [27].
Table 3 presents the rDNS lookup results using random sam-
pling. The block-based sampling method returned similar results,
and thus we do not present them due to space constraints. In to-
tal, 34.53% rDNS records contain keywords that suggest the corre-
sponding IP addresses as dynamic. Among those, DSL constitutes
a large portion, suggesting that a signiﬁcant fraction of users access
Hotmail through home computers via DSL links.
There are 21.21% lookups returning no rDNS records. These
might also correspond to dynamic IP addresses because a static host
is more likely to have been conﬁgured with a host name for it to be
reachable. We do ﬁnd a small fraction (1.63%) of the rDNS records
contain keywords (i.e., mail, server, www, web, static) that
suggest them as static IP addresses. For the remaining 43.53%
rDNS records, we cannot infer any network properties based on
their returned names. Around half of these rDNS records contain
the IP addresses they are pointing to. For example: 190.50.156.163
is associated to 190-50-156-163.speedy.com.ar.
Due to the incomplete information from both Dynablock and
rDNS, we were not able to verify all UDmap IP addresses. In fact,
the lack of sufﬁcient existing information about IP dynamics fur-
ther conﬁrms the importance of an automatic method for inferring

IP address space

such properties. We emphasize that UDmap not only outputs the
dynamic IP lists, but also returns the ﬁne-grained IP volatility in-
formation – the rate at which an IP is assigned to different hosts.
Applications can leverage such information to determine the corre-
sponding host properties based on their speciﬁc application context.
6. UNDERSTANDING IP DYNAMICS
In this section, we present the detailed study of IP dynamics
based on the identiﬁed 102 million UDmap IP addresses. Under-
standing IP dynamics has huge implications to applications that use
IP addresses to represent hosts. Broadly, our study seeks to answer
the following two sets of questions:
• How are dynamic IP addresses distributed across the Inter-
net, and in particular, what address portions do they origi-
nate from and what are the top domains that have the most
number of dynamic IPs?
• How volatile are dynamic IP addresses, and in particular,
how often does the host identity change on average? What
types of IP addresses are more volatile than others? Finally,
how consistent is IP volatility within address blocks?
6.1 Address Distributions in the Internet
Figure 6 plots the distribution of UDmap IP addresses across the
IP address space. As a comparison, we also plot the distributions
of the Hotmail user-login IPs and Dynablock IPs. For all three
categories, the majority of IP addresses originate from two relative
small regions of the address space (58.255-88.255 and 195.128-
222.255), suggesting their distributions across the IP space are far
from uniform.
Overall, UDmap IPs distribute evenly across the IP space used by
Hotmail users. The only notable exception appears within the small
address range 72.164-75.0, where UDmap did not classify these
addresses as dynamic. Whois database [30] query results indicate
this region is used by Qwest (72.164/15) and Comcast (73.0/8 and
74.16/10), both of which are large ISPs in the U.S. Based on sam-
pled rDNS lookups, certain IP addresses from Qwest have the key-
word static in their resolved names, suggesting the ones not
picked by UDmap might correspond to static IPs. In Section 6.2.3,
we also present results indicating that IP addresses under Comcast
are indeed not very dynamic. There are about 10% of Dynablock
IPs within the address range of 4.8-58.255. Only a small fraction
of these dynamic IPs were observed in our input data and hence
appeared as UDmap IP addresses.

In an attempt to study the domains and ASes that have the largest
number of UDmap IPs, we extracted top-level domain information
from the rDNS lookup results that we obtained during the valida-
tion process (see Section 5.3) 4. As shown in Table 4, among the
successfully resolved names, 77.35% are from the .net domain,
suggesting that these IPs are owned by various ISPs. This is not sur-
prising, given that ISPs typically offer network access to customers
using dynamically assigned IP addresses through DHCP. We also
notice a signiﬁcant portion of the IP addresses from the .com do-
main (21.20%). Many of these .com host names contain keywords
such as tel or net in their resolved names (e.g., idcnet.com,
inter-tel.com). We manually visited several such Web sites,
and conﬁrmed that they are also consumer network ISPs. For ex-
ample, IP addresses with host names ending in idcnet.com are
owned by a wireless network provider [12]. Other than the .net
and the .com domains, the percentage of UDmap IPs from other
domains is very small. In particular, only 1.14% of the resolved
hosts are from the .edu domain. For reference, we also report re-
sults pertaining to IPs in the input log, shown in the second row
of Table 4. The percentage of IPs in the .net domain drops from
77.35% (UDmap IPs) to 70.34% (all IPs), while all other categories
increase. This suggests that IPs in the .net domain are more likely
to be dynamic, while IPs in other domains have a higher chance of
being static.
Table 5 lists the top ASes with the most number of UDmap IPs.
Interestingly, we ﬁnd all of the ASes correspond to large ISPs that
directly offer Internet access to consumers. Out of the top 10 ASes,
four are from the United States, with SBC Internet Services being
the top AS with over 5 million of UDmap IPs.
Both Table 4 and Table 5 suggest that a large fraction of UDmap
IP addresses are from consumer networks connecting to the Internet
using DSL or dial-up links. These IP addresses are thus more likely
used by home computers or small enterprise hosts.
6.2
IP Volatility Analysis
In this section, we study the volatility of UDmap IPs. We focus
on the following two metrics: (1) the number of users that have
used each IP in our data, (2) the median inter-user duration (we
use median as opposed to mean to eliminate outliers). We begin
by presenting the volatility of all UDmap IPs. We then examine
the degree of similarities between IPs in a same block based on IP
volatility. Finally, we use a simple, yet illustrative case study to
show the impact of network access type on IP volatility.
4We excluded the country code before we extracted the top-level
domains from host names.
