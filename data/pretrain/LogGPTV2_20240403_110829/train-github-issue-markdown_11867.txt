### System info

  * Other info:
Before I update playwright today (May, 15), this error didn't happen. I tried
to run the same script last week and was running ok. Didn't happen any update
in my electron app that could possible break.
**Test file (self-contained)**
    test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
            electronApp = await electron.launch({ executablePath:  '' });
            window = await electronApp.firstWindow();
**Expected**
Expect to open the electron app and run the test script.
**Actual**
Appears the error:
  1. test_LoginNGMT.spec.js:26:5 › Try to Sign In › login field ────────────────────────────────────  
Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded while running "beforeEach" hook.
