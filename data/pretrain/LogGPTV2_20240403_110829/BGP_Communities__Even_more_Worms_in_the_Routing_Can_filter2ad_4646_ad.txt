length increases the fraction of the communities that travel longer
distances decreases somewhat. The reason for is that each AS on
the path can add communities. Therefore, the expected number of
communities that can only travel some portion of the AS path is
higher. Thus, the plot highlights that communities are propagated
significant distances in the Internet independent of the AS path
length.
Using the same data we measure how many ASes propagate
communities, i.e., are transitive for at least one BGP community
of another AS. We do not include the ASes that directly peer with
the collector5. Thus, for AS2 to be considered transitive we require
at least one BGP update for a prefix p tagged with a community
AS1:X on a path AS3 AS2 AS1. We find that there are 2.2K transit
ASes6 that relay communities relative to a total of 15.5K transit
ASes in our dataset.
Next, we explore popular values involved in the observed com-
munities and how these differ for off- vs. on-path communities.
Overall, we find that the tails are extremely longÐa consequence
of the non-standardization of communities. Figure 5(c) shows a
histogram of the top-10 most popular values for both off- and on-
path communities. Each bar is annotated with the corresponding
community values. Note, that their individual contribution is rather
small and that they differ significantly. Among the most popular
off-path communities is 666 which is used for blackholing. For
on-path 666 is not among the top-10 community values. Rather,
it is far down in the tail. One explanation is that it is often not
observable for on-path since the respective AS should have acted
upon receiving the blackhole community. For off-path we see more
announcements with blackholing as they are often applied on all
peering sessions rather than only selectively [36]. The other values
look like convenient values, e.g., for local pref with 100, 200, and
1000.
4.4 BGP Communities Filters
So far we focused on how common communities are and if they are
forwarded. We have yet to measure if ASes only selectively forward
communities or if they actively filter them. As there is no best
practice on how to handle communities, networks may filter out all,
none, or just specific ones. Measuring this is not straightforward
as the only indication of filtering (resp. selective forwarding) is the
5The configuration for these peerings is often collector specific and may differ from
the łregularž policy of the AS.
6We consider an AS a transit AS if there is at least one AS path in which it is neither
the origin nor the collector.

(a) AS edges community change indication counts. After annotating

lack of community propagation as seen in the BGP data. Further
compounding the measurement difficulty are that (a) any AS on
the path may remove a community, and (b) an AS may receive a
łbetter routež (in the sense of BGP best path selection) not tagged
with the community.
We nevertheless try to identify BGP neighbors where commu-
nities are not propagated by collecting indication counts for each
directed AS pair. We iterate through all prefixes and, for each prefix
p, we consider all updates at the same time and look for ASes where
a community that has already been forwarded is propagated to one
peer but not to another. The latter is an indication of filtering or
selective forwarding. The former is an indication of forwarding,
i.e., no filtering.
To make this more concrete consider the example shown in Fig-
ure 6(a). We find two announcements A1 , A2 for prefix p originating
in AS1 in the bgpdumps of BGP collectors in AS4 and AS5. An-
nouncement A1 contains AS-Path AS1, AS2, AS3, AS4 and carries
a community AS2:X, while A2 has AS-Path AS1, AS2, AS3, AS5
and carries no communities at all. For this analysis we assume the
community was not added earlier than AS2. Thus we increase the
community-added indication on the edge (AS2, AS3).
Here, A1 serves as an indication that AS3 transitively forwards
the community from AS2 onwards. Therefore, we increase the
community-forwarded indication count for the AS pair (AS3, AS4).
A2 allows us to increase the community-filtered indication count
of AS pair (AS3, AS5). We know from A1 that for this prefix the
285
community AS2:X is forwarded to AS3 and that AS3 forwards it to
some other peers; but we do not see it on the edge (AS3, AS5).
We find signs of transitive forwarding of communities for 4% of
the almost 400,000 AS edges and for filtering for roughly 10%. These
numbers increase to 6% resp. 15% if we consider AS edges with at
least 100 AS paths. We acknowledge that the results of the above
heuristic are biased by the BGP collectors which give us different
degrees of visibility of the AS edges, as well as by the number of
paths observed within the observation period. However, since we
consider a full month of BGP updates from four different collector
platforms we have reasonable coverage of the AS graph.
Figure 6(b) shows a scatter plot on log-log axis (to the base of
10)7 of the filtering vs. non-filtering indicators per AS edge. We only
include AS edges with at least 100 BGP paths and where we can
find either an indication for or against filtering. The count values
per AS edge range from 0 to 98 million (thus, the values on the x-
and y-axis) which comes from the number of different communities
and paths that are used in the filter indication computation. The
color of the hex-bins correspond to the number of AS edges (darker
color indicates more AS edges).
For some AS edges, we find indications that they strip all com-
munities. Those are the ones on the bottom. For others, on the
left hand side, we see no indication of filtering, i.e., they forward
all communities without touching them. Naturally, we have also
many AS edges in the middle of the plot, where we have mixed
indications: some communities are forwarded and some are filtered.
The explanation for this mixed picture lies in the absence of best
practices regarding BGP communities. After inquiring within the
operator community, we found that nearly everyone has a different
view on thisÐsome remove all communities, some do not tamper
with them at all, while others act upon and remove communities
directed at them and leave the rest in place. On the other hand,
there are operational reasons to only forward some communities
to some BGP neighbors, e.g., different handling of customers and
peers.
One natural question in this context is if the relationship type of
an AS edge has any influence on filtering. To check this we use the
CAIDA AS relationship dataset [2] to distinguish between customer-
provider, provider-customer, and peering edges. However, we find
that this classification is too coarse grained to allow for a conclusive
picture regarding handling of communities. Thus, we plan in future
work to correlate filtering/non-filtering of communities with the
role of an AS in the Internet topology.
5 UNHAPPY SCENARIOS
In this section, we highlight different scenarios where transitive
community propagation can enable unintended results, including
remotely triggered blackholing, traffic steering, and route manipu-
lation.
5.1 Remotely Triggered Blackholing
High-volume DDoS network attacks can heavily degrade network
performance even to the point of making services unavailable [21,
32]. Especially edge networks often suffer as they cannot handle

such high traffic levels. One mitigation option is blackholing, i.e.,
dropping all traffic going to a destination under attack, ideally, as
close to the source as possible. As result, the victim IP address or the
entire prefix becomes intentionally unreachable. Many networks
provide their customers with the ability to automatically blackhole
traffic using BGP communities as a signaling mechanism, so-called
łremotely triggered blackholingž (RTBH) [47]. Networks issue black-
holing requests by sending BGP announcements to their direct BGP
neighbors for specific destination prefixes with the blackholing
community of the respective network. The neighbor, upon receiv-
ing such an announcement discards, at its ingress, traffic whose
destination address is in the blackholed prefix. In principle, this
service should only be used in case of attack and by networks which
actually have authority for the blackholed prefix or IP address.
However, consider the example shown in Figure 7(a). Here, AS1
announces prefix p to both AS2 and AS3. AS3 offers blackholing
service and is the community target in this scenario. If AS2, the
attacker, adds the blackhole tagged for AS3 to its announcement
for p to AS3, traffic to p may be blackholed at AS3 even though the
AS path of the tagged route is longer. The reason is often preferred
treatment of the blackhole community before best path selection,
see, e.g., the suggested configuration in [27]. Alternatively, AS2, the
attacker, may announce a more specific of p which again has higher
priority than the direct announcement from AS1, the attackee. Note,
if AS4 also offers blackholing services via communities the same
attack can be launched with AS4 as community target as long as
AS3 propagates communities.
The above example requires the attacker, AS2, to be on a path
from AS1 to AS3. However, even if this is not the case AS2 may be
able to hijack prefix p, especially if AS2 and AS3 are peering, since
strict prefix validation is often not in place, see Figure 7(b). Indeed,
[53] reports 5,295 routing attacks (route leaks and hijacks) alone in
2017 which arguably should not be so frequent if proper filtering
would be in place.
Even when prefix validation is in place, it may be possible to
hijack prefixes, by tagging them with a blackhole community, de-
pending on the order in which announcements are processed by
a router’s filters. For example, there are configurations, e.g., [56],
where instead of discarding the announcement (due to hijacking)
the router might process the hijacked announcement if tagged
with the blackhole community as the community raises the routes
precedence.

Figure 8: Traffic steering.
If AS2 has the ability to hijack prefix p of the attackee (AS1), it
can announce p with a short AS path tagged with the blackhole
community of AS3. This causes AS3, the community target, to drop
all traffic to p. Again, a similar scenario is possible with AS4 as
community target if AS3 propagates AS4s blackholing communities.
Note, such an attack may be more or less interesting than simply
hijacking. First, it may be effective only because of the community
tag (validation done after blackholing). Second, whereas hijack-
ing may only partially disrupt traffic (to the poisoned ASes), the
hijacking plus blackholing attack disrupts all traffic to the victim.
5.2 Traffic Steering
Traffic engineering is one of the essential tasks of a network opera-
tor. The generally preferred choice for an AS is selective announce-
ment of prefixes. Sometimes, this is not desired or not sufficient. A
common alternative is for remote ASes to provide AS path prepend-
ing, Local Preference tuning, Multiple Exit Discriminator (MED)

tuning, or partial route announcements, e.g., in specific regions
such as Europe only, US only, Asia only. Many ASes accept signals
for these tunings via BGP communities; and many ASes are offering
these traffic steering services to their customers.
Recall the example from Figure 2 in Section 3. It highlights that
it is possible to intentionally or unintentionally steer traffic over a
link that should not be used according to the AS’s policy. Indeed,
if the involved ASes are susceptible to prefix hijacking this can
be further misused as shown in Figure 8. An attacker AS may
hijack prefix p (which AS1 receives from a peer) and tag it with the
prepending community, thus, rerouting traffic via AS58. This can
cause trouble for AS1, either due to the unintentional heavy use of
the link between AS1 and AS5, e.g., a paid peering link, or if AS2
and AS5 collaborate and AS5 has a malicious traffic tap to inspect
all traffic to p.
The next example, see Figure 8(b), shows how AS2, the attacker,
can use the local pref communities of AS1 to force AS1 to route all
its traffic to AS2 over a single link via AS4 to AS1. While this may
