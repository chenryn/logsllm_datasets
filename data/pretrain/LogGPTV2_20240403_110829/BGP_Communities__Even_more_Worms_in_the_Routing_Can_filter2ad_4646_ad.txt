### Length and Community Propagation in AS Paths

As the length of an Autonomous System (AS) path increases, the fraction of communities that travel longer distances decreases. This phenomenon occurs because each AS along the path can add its own communities, leading to a higher expected number of communities that only traverse a portion of the entire AS path. Consequently, the data highlights that BGP communities are propagated over significant distances in the Internet, regardless of the AS path length.

### Measuring Community Propagation by ASes

Using the same dataset, we measure the number of ASes that propagate communities, i.e., those that are transitive for at least one BGP community from another AS. We exclude ASes that directly peer with the collector. For an AS2 to be considered transitive, there must be at least one BGP update for a prefix \( p \) tagged with a community \( AS1:X \) on a path \( AS3 \rightarrow AS2 \rightarrow AS1 \). Our analysis reveals that 2.2K transit ASes relay communities, out of a total of 15.5K transit ASes in our dataset.

### Popular Community Values

Next, we explore the popular values observed in the communities and how they differ between off-path and on-path communities. The tails of the distribution are extremely long, a consequence of the lack of standardization in BGP communities. Figure 5(c) shows a histogram of the top-10 most popular values for both off- and on-path communities, with each bar annotated with the corresponding community values. 

Notably, the individual contributions of these values are relatively small and differ significantly. Among the most popular off-path communities is \( 666 \), which is used for blackholing. However, \( 666 \) is not among the top-10 community values for on-path communities; instead, it appears far down in the tail. One explanation is that the respective AS should have acted upon receiving the blackhole community, making it often unobservable for on-path. In contrast, off-path announcements frequently include blackholing, as it is often applied to all peering sessions rather than selectively. Other popular values, such as \( 100 \), \( 200 \), and \( 1000 \), appear to be convenient values, possibly used for local preferences.

### BGP Communities Filters

We have so far focused on the prevalence and forwarding of BGP communities. To understand if ASes selectively forward or actively filter communities, we need to measure their behavior. Given the lack of best practices, networks may filter out all, none, or specific communities. Measuring this is challenging, as the only indication of filtering (or selective forwarding) is the absence of community propagation in BGP data. Additionally, any AS on the path may remove a community, and an AS may receive a "better" route (in the sense of BGP best path selection) without the community.

To identify BGP neighbors where communities are not propagated, we collect indication counts for each directed AS pair. For each prefix \( p \), we consider all updates simultaneously and look for ASes where a community that has already been forwarded is propagated to one peer but not to another. This serves as an indication of filtering or selective forwarding. Conversely, if the community is propagated, it indicates no filtering.

For example, in Figure 6(a), we find two announcements \( A1 \) and \( A2 \) for prefix \( p \) originating in AS1. Announcement \( A1 \) contains the AS-Path \( AS1, AS2, AS3, AS4 \) and carries a community \( AS2:X \), while \( A2 \) has the AS-Path \( AS1, AS2, AS3, AS5 \) and carries no communities. Assuming the community was not added earlier than AS2, we increase the community-added indication on the edge \( (AS2, AS3) \). Here, \( A1 \) indicates that AS3 transitively forwards the community from AS2 onwards, increasing the community-forwarded indication count for the AS pair \( (AS3, AS4) \). \( A2 \) allows us to increase the community-filtered indication count for the AS pair \( (AS3, AS5) \).

Our analysis shows signs of transitive forwarding of communities for 4% of the almost 400,000 AS edges and for filtering for roughly 10%. These numbers increase to 6% and 15%, respectively, when considering AS edges with at least 100 AS paths. Figure 6(b) presents a scatter plot on log-log axes (base 10) of the filtering vs. non-filtering indicators per AS edge, including only AS edges with at least 100 BGP paths and where we can find either an indication for or against filtering. The color of the hex-bins corresponds to the number of AS edges (darker color indicates more AS edges).

Some AS edges show indications of stripping all communities, while others show no indication of filtering, meaning they forward all communities without modification. Many AS edges exhibit mixed behavior, where some communities are forwarded and some are filtered. This mixed picture is due to the lack of best practices regarding BGP communities. After consulting with the operator community, we found that nearly every network has a different approachâ€”some remove all communities, some do not tamper with them, and others act upon and remove specific communities.

### Relationship Type and Filtering

We also investigate whether the relationship type of an AS edge influences filtering. Using the CAIDA AS relationship dataset, we distinguish between customer-provider, provider-customer, and peering edges. However, this classification is too coarse-grained to provide a conclusive picture. Future work will correlate filtering/non-filtering of communities with the role of an AS in the Internet topology.

### Unintended Consequences of Transitive Community Propagation

#### Remotely Triggered Blackholing

High-volume DDoS attacks can severely degrade network performance. One mitigation option is blackholing, where traffic to a destination under attack is dropped. Many networks use BGP communities for remotely triggered blackholing (RTBH). Consider the scenario in Figure 7(a), where AS1 announces prefix \( p \) to AS2 and AS3. If AS2, the attacker, adds the blackhole tag for AS3 to its announcement for \( p \) to AS3, traffic to \( p \) may be blackholed at AS3, even though the AS path of the tagged route is longer. Alternatively, AS2 may announce a more specific prefix, which has higher priority than the direct announcement from AS1, the attackee.

Even if AS2 is not on the path from AS1 to AS3, it may still hijack prefix \( p \), especially if AS2 and AS3 are peering, as strict prefix validation is often not in place (Figure 7(b)). There were 5,295 routing attacks reported in 2017, suggesting that proper filtering is not always in place.

#### Traffic Steering

Traffic engineering is a critical task for network operators. Some ASes use BGP communities to signal traffic steering, such as AS path prepending, Local Preference tuning, and MED tuning. An attacker AS may hijack prefix \( p \) and tag it with a prepending community, rerouting traffic via AS5 (Figure 8(a)). This can cause issues for AS1, either due to the unintentional heavy use of the link between AS1 and AS5 or if AS2 and AS5 collaborate to inspect traffic to \( p \).

Another example (Figure 8(b)) shows how AS2, the attacker, can use the local pref communities of AS1 to force AS1 to route all its traffic to AS2 over a single link via AS4 to AS1. This can lead to congestion or other operational issues.

### Route Manipulation at an IXP

Finally, consider the scenario in Figure 9, where AS1 sends prefix \( p \) with an IXP:AS4 community. If AS2 hijacks and tags \( p \) with IXP:0:AS4, AS4 will have no route to \( p \), causing disruption for AS1 and potentially other ASes.

These examples highlight the potential for unintended consequences when BGP communities are misused, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and best practices in BGP community handling.
