Hello,
I upgrade my PHP version from PHP 5.6.36 to PHP 7.2, but I have a problem when
I want to use the migrate function of Session component.
My simple line of code :  
`$this->request->getSession()->migrate(true, $newLifetime);`
The error returned :  
`Warning: ini_set(): A session is active. You cannot change the session
module's ini settings at this time `
I have already a session opened before by my login page, but I want to change
the session life time on login.  
My Symfony version 2.8.44  
Thanks for your help
