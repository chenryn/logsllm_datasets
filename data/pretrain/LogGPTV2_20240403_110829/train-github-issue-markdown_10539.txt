Subject: Issue with Session Migration After Upgrading PHP Version

Hello,

I recently upgraded my PHP version from 5.6.36 to 7.2, and I am encountering an issue when attempting to use the `migrate` function of the Session component in Symfony.

Here is the relevant line of code:
```php
$this->request->getSession()->migrate(true, $newLifetime);
```

The error message I receive is:
```
Warning: ini_set(): A session is active. You cannot change the session module's ini settings at this time.
```

I have a session that is already active, initiated by the login page. My goal is to change the session lifetime upon login.

- **PHP Version:** 7.2
- **Symfony Version:** 2.8.44

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
