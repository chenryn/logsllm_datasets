6.5 Impact of Lame Delegation
In addition to their security risks (Section 5.6), lame delegations also
degrade DNS resolution performance. In this section we quantify
this performance impact and show that it affects even popular
domains.
Lame delegations cause useless DNS queries. When resolving a
domain that has at least one lame delegated nameserver, a resolver
may have to contact multiple nameservers to successfully resolve
the domain. As a result, the average resolution time for lame dele-
gated domains will increase. To quantify this impact experimentally,
we used data from OpenINTEL [28] to calculate the average res-
olution time for resolving the roughly 49 million domains in our
active measurement set over the month of March 2020. OpenINTEL
performs active measurement using a normal resolver to resolve
domains. The normal resolution method approximates the user
experience, and averaging resolution performance measurements
over a month minimizes short-term variance.
The average resolution time for domains that are fully resolvable
(without any lame delegated nameserver) was 172 ms, whereas do-
mains with lame delegated nameservers had a significantly higher
resolution time. For partly lame delegated domains (where a sub-
set of the nameservers are lame), the average resolution time was
720 ms. For fully lame delegated domains, the resolution time was
1743 ms, an order of magnitude higher than fully resolvable do-
mains. Note that these resolution times were bounded by timeout
errors and caching since this data came from using a normal resolver
process. Even entirely lame delegated domains ultimately have a
maximum finite resolution time.
Figure 6 breaks down resolution times for the domains in our
data set by the percentage of their lame delegated nameservers. For
example, for domains with (40,60%] lame delegated nameservers
(e.g., domains with two nameservers where one of them is lame, or
domains with five nameservers where three are lame), the average
resolution time was 0.59 seconds, 3.4× higher than domains with
no lame delegated nameservers (the “0%” bucket). Overall the figure
shows that a higher percentage of lame delegated nameservers per
domain resulted in higher average resolution time.
We also observed that lame delegations occurred even on popular
domains. Table 13 shows the number of domains in our active
measurement set that are on Alexa Top lists [4], and the number
of those that were fully and partly lame. We used the Alexa list
for April 13, 2020, which corresponds to the midpoint of our active
measurement campaign.
Table 13 shows that lame delegations, while not as ubiquitous,
were present even for popular domains. Consider archive.org,
an Alexa Top 200 site, which has one lame delegation of five possi-
ble delegations. As of September 12, 2020, archive.org was still
partly lame delegated.13 Surprisingly, we also encountered fully

lame delegations in popular domains. We found that most domains
switched their nameservers soon after, remediating the lame dele-
gation. These observations reinforce our hypothesis that fully lame
delegations are likely to be fixed more quickly than partly lame
delegations because the domains are unusable when fully lame
delegated.
Finally, as yet another perspective indicating that lame dele-
gations are a notable operational issue, GoDaddy estimates that
roughly 12% of requests to their nameservers are for domains for
which they are not authoritative [24].
7 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
We had to consider ethical aspects of characterization and responsi-
ble disclosure of lame delegations. Domains with lame delegations
may be at risk of being hijacked. Given the many thousands of
at-risk nameserver domains, we cannot defensively register all of
them, which would raise its own ethical issues if we could. Without
the ability to protect these lame domains, disclosing them increases
the risk of harm to their owners and users. We are working on a
responsible way to disclose our snapshot of lame delegations.
8 SUMMARY
The Internet, as it is commonly taught, is constructed from simple
abstractions implemented via a number of key network protocols.
Invariably, however, there is significant daylight between this clean
abstract model of how the Internet functions and the frequently
messy reality of its concrete operation. Measurement studies such
as this one are the mechanisms we use to characterize this gap in
understanding. Our work characterizing the presence and risks of
lame delegation in the DNS exemplifies the value of this kind of
empirical study.
Using comprehensive collections of both active and passive DNS
measurements (covering 49 M and 499 M domains respectively), we
found that lame delegations are surprisingly common: roughly 14%
of registered domains that we actively measured had at least one
lame delegation, and most of those had no working authoritative
nameservers. However, even for domains with working alternative
nameservers, our measurements show that these lame delegations
impair DNS performance (average resolution latency increasing
by 3.7×) in addition to producing substantial unnecessary load on
existing nameservers.
Finally, we found that unregistered or expired domains in lame
delegations can create significant security risk. Indeed, over the
last nine years, we identified at least three instances in which an
attacker could have hijacked thousands of domains by registering
a single nameserver domain. Analysis of this phenomenon led us
to discover an unforeseen interaction between registrar practice
and the constraints of registry provisioning systems that has in-
advertently made hundreds of thousands of domains vulnerable
to hijacking due to accidental lame delegations. This practice has
persisted for over twenty years, but we are now working with
registrars to remediate it and its effects.
Going forward, we are exploring ways to combine daily zone
data and periodic active measurements to automatically identify
and report lame delegations as they are created. An open question
remains about the most effective mechanisms for communicating
these findings to appropriate stakeholders to incent corrective ac-
tion. As well, the security issues that arise as unintended byproducts
of registrar/registry practices deserve further attention as this as-
pect of the domain name ecosystem is largely opaque to the research
community.
Many domain operators configure redundancy in resolution in-
frastructure, which can hide underlying systemic issues for long
periods of time. Ironically, this engineered robustness poses a secu-
rity threat, as domain operators rarely take notice of DNS configu-
rations unless their domain stops resolving completely. Thus they
are likely to fail to notice partly lame domains that attackers can
exploit.
While some systematic issues such as the “DROPTHISHOST
anomaly” require registrar-level intervention to fix, domain owners
can proactively monitor their own domain configurations. In pur-
suit of improved monitoring and remediation, we are developing a
monitoring tool to allow domain owners to check static zone files
for potential delegation-related security risks, and will integrate it
into our zone analysis platform. Finally, we have begun an effort to
work with the registrar and registry communities to responsibly
disclose such risks, establish their underlying causes, and develop
improved operational practices to minimize lame delegations going
forward.
