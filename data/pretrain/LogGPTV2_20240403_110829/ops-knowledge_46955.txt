User: How to implement disk partitioning and formatting under Linux, and mount it to a specified directory?
Assistant: 1. Use the fdisk command to partition: open the terminal, enter sudo fdisk -l to view the disk partitions in the system, then enter sudo fdisk /dev/sda (take sda as an example) to enter the fdisk partition interactive interface; enter m to view the help information, enter n To create a new partition, enter p to select the primary partition, enter a number to select the number of the area to be partitioned, then enter the start/end sector (the default is to start occupying the entire disk space), and then enter w to write and exit. Note that the partition type and size must be selected reasonably according to the needs. 2. Format the partition: Use the mkfs command to format the partition, for example, enter sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 to format the sda1 partition as an ext4 file system. 3. Mount to the specified directory: Select an existing directory as the mount point, such as /mnt/data, and then enter sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/data. You can mount the sda1 partition to the /mnt/data directory. If you need to mount permanently, you need to modify the /etc/fstab file and add a line to it, for example: /dev/sda1 /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 0 to realize automatic mounting when booting.
