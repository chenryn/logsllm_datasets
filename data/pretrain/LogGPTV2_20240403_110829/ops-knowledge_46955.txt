To implement disk partitioning, formatting, and mounting under Linux, follow these steps:

1. **Partition the Disk:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Use `sudo fdisk -l` to list all available disks and their partitions.
   - Identify the disk you want to partition (e.g., `/dev/sda`).
   - Run `sudo fdisk /dev/sda` to enter the interactive fdisk utility.
   - Type `m` to view the help menu.
   - Type `n` to create a new partition.
   - Select `p` for a primary partition.
   - Enter the partition number (e.g., 1 for the first partition).
   - Set the start and end sectors (or accept the defaults to use the entire available space).
   - Type `w` to write the changes and exit.

   **Note:** Ensure that the partition type and size are chosen based on your specific requirements.

2. **Format the Partition:**
   - Use the `mkfs` command to format the partition. For example, to format the newly created partition (`/dev/sda1`) as an ext4 file system, run:
     ```bash
     sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
     ```

3. **Mount the Partition:**
   - Choose or create a directory to serve as the mount point. For instance, `/mnt/data`.
   - Mount the partition to the specified directory using the `mount` command:
     ```bash
     sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/data
     ```

4. **Set Up Permanent Mounting:**
   - To ensure the partition is mounted automatically at boot, edit the `/etc/fstab` file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/fstab
     ```
   - Add the following line to the file, adjusting the UUID if necessary:
     ```plaintext
     /dev/sda1 /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 0
     ```
   - Save and close the file. The partition will now be mounted automatically when the system boots.

By following these steps, you can successfully partition, format, and mount a disk in Linux.
