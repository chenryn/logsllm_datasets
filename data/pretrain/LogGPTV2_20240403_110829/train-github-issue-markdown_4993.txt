Numerous Warnings and Errors occur when including LibTorch in .cu files. I
think maybe some compiling settings are wrong...
One of error is as following.
    /home/libtorch/include/torch/csrc/api/include/torch/nn/cloneable.h:68:61: error: invalid static_cast from type ‘const torch::OrderedDict, std::shared_ptr >’ to type ‘torch::OrderedDict, std::shared_ptr >&’
Most of errors are similar as this one.
## To Reproduce
Easily to reproduce, just set all things as following and compile the cmake
project
files
    src
    |-- test.cu
    |-- CMakeLists.txt
test.cu
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
CMakeLists.txt
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8 FATAL_ERROR)
    set(CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER "nvcc")
    set(CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_VERSION "10.1")
    project(cmake_and_cuda LANGUAGES CXX CUDA)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${TORCH_CXX_FLAGS}")
    find_package(Torch REQUIRED)
    file(GLOB_RECURSE SRC_FILES_TEMP
      ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/*.cpp 
      ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/*.h 
      ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/*.cu)
    add_library(main_lib STATIC ${SRC_FILES_TEMP})
    target_include_directories(main_lib PUBLIC ${TORCH_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    target_compile_features(main_lib PUBLIC cxx_std_14)
    set_target_properties( main_lib
                           PROPERTIES CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON 
                          )
    add_executable(main test.cu)
    set_target_properties(main PROPERTIES CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON)
    target_link_libraries(main PUBLIC main_lib)
    target_link_libraries(main PUBLIC ${TORCH_LIBRARIES})
make command
    cmake ../src/ -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libtorch && make
## Expected behavior
 can be included in .cu files and we can implement some self-
defined CUDA+Torch layers to construct NNs in C++ front-end without pybind11
and python.
## Environment
  * PyTorch Version: LibTorch 1.4.0
  * OS: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
  * How you installed PyTorch: Source
  * Python version: 3.7
  * CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
  * GPU models and configuration: 2x Titan V
  * GCC version: 5.5.0
  * CMake version: version 3.14.7
## Additional context
I am highly appreciated for you guys developing the torch C++ Library. For me,
I want to define some CUDA forward/backward layers with Torch C++ Library,
such layers will be used in my c++/cuda based torch model. It is to say, I
will construct/train/predict my neural networks in .cpp and .cu files totally,
instead of using pybind11 and python. So I need to include  in
.cu files.  
(By now, I can only include libtorch in .cpp files, but it is not enough for
me...)
