I understand that this feature may be outside the current specifications, but I would like to propose adding support for the Elvis operator in the playground. The Elvis operator can significantly enhance code readability and safety by providing a concise way to handle null or undefined values. Here are some examples of how it could be implemented:

- `object?.property` // Equivalent to `object && object.property`
- `foo?()` // Equivalent to `foo && foo()`

This addition would streamline conditional property access and function calls, making the code cleaner and more robust.
