await does not works on method of super class
    class Animal {
      constructor() {
      }
      async walk() {
        console.log('animal walk')
      }
    }
    class Dog extends Animal {
      constructor() {
        super();
      }
      async walk() {
        await super.walk();
        console.log('dog walk');
      }
    }
I suppose this piece of code should work, but It doesn't, as method walk of
Dog will be transformed to
    class Dog extends Animal {
      ...
      walk() {
          return __awaiter(this, void 0, Promise, function* () {
              yield super.walk();
              console.log('dog walk');
          });
      }
    }
but the specification says keyword 'super' is only permitted in a constructor,
method call and member accessor in derived class.
