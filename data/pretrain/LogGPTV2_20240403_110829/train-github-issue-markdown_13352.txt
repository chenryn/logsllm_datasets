Subject: Inquiry Regarding urllib3 Version Upgrade for Security Build

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

We are currently utilizing piprot as part of our security build process. Recently, our builds have been failing due to a medium-risk alert from piprot, which indicates that the `urllib3` module is one or more minor versions out of date. Specifically, we are being advised to upgrade to version 1.25.2, whereas our current version is 1.24.2.

Could you please inform us if an upgrade to the recommended version (v1.25.2) is feasible in the near future? This update is necessary to ensure the stability and security of our build environment.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
