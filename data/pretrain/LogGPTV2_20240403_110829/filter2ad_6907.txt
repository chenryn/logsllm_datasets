## Abstract
Weather is known to significantly impact the demand for utilities such as electricity and gas. Given that internet usage is closely tied to human activity, it is reasonable to hypothesize a similar correlation between internet traffic demand and weather conditions. This paper empirically quantifies these effects. We find that the influence of precipitation varies by time of day and time of year, with the greatest impact observed in the late afternoon during summer months.

## 1. Introduction
The analysis and forecasting of internet traffic have been extensively studied, with numerous applications [5]. These studies often use statistical tools to capture the dominant characteristics of traffic dynamics, without explicitly modeling the dependence on external factors such as social events or weather, which are typically treated as noise. While it is well-known that these factors significantly affect the demand for utilities [4] and TV ratings [6], their relationship with internet traffic demand remains poorly understood. In this paper, we empirically investigate the relationship between internet traffic demand and one of the key factors influencing traffic variability: weather.

The interaction between weather conditions and traffic demand occurs at multiple timescales. Short-term weather events, such as precipitation, have a direct effect on traffic demand. Longer-term effects, reflected in seasonal changes in temperature and daylight duration, have a more gradual influence on internet traffic. This study focuses on short-term correlations. For a more comprehensive analysis of long-term correlations and a deeper examination of short-term effects, readers are referred to our technical report [3].

## 2. Datasets Description
To measure internet traffic demand in specific areas, we used data from three Internet Exchange Points (IXPs): Slovak-IX, FICIX, and INEX. We obtained 5-minute granular traffic data from each IXP by processing publicly available MRTG images. Our dataset includes 8 months of data from INEX and 18 months of data from Slovak-IX and FICIX. Unlike large IXPs [1], the traffic from these IXPs is highly localized, making them suitable for our analysis.

For weather data, we utilized the Weather Underground database, accessible at http://www.wunderground.com/. This database provides a wide range of weather parameters with a 30-minute granularity. For this study, we collected precipitation data for the cities where each IXP is located, covering the same period as our traffic data.

## 3. Short-Term Correlations
The data described in Section 2 allows us to observe changes in traffic over short-time scales and compare them to weather conditions. We divided the day into 2-hour time slots. Let \( u(t) \) represent the total traffic transiting through the IXP. To remove seasonal effects, we normalized \( u(t) \) with the average traffic over a two-week period centered at \( t \):

\[
\bar{u}(t) = \frac{u(t)}{\text{average}(u(t-84), \ldots, u(t+84))}
\]

This normalized traffic \( \bar{u}(t) \) measures the short-term variability of traffic, independent of long-term seasonality.

For each 2-hour time slot \( t \), there are 4 or more weather records in our dataset. We defined a binary variable \( \text{wet}(t) \) as 1 if any of the weather records report precipitation (e.g., snow, shower, rain, storm), and 0 otherwise. This binary variable simplifies the presentation of results. Our goal is to examine whether precipitation affects traffic and quantify its effect. To do this, we split the day into twelve 2-hour intervals and calculated the average normalized traffic with and without precipitation for each interval:

\[
A(i) = \frac{\sum_{\substack{s \\ \text{mod}(s,12)=i}} \bar{u}(s) \cdot \text{wet}(s)}{\sum_{\substack{s \\ \text{mod}(s,12)=i}} \text{wet}(s)}
\]
\[
B(i) = \frac{\sum_{\substack{s \\ \text{mod}(s,12)=i}} \bar{u}(s) \cdot (1 - \text{wet}(s))}{\sum_{\substack{s \\ \text{mod}(s,12)=i}} (1 - \text{wet}(s))}
\]

Thus, for the twelve time intervals (0h-2h, 2h-4h, ..., 22h-24h), \( A(i) \) and \( B(i) \) represent the average normalized load in the interval \([2ih, (2i+2)h]\) with and without precipitation, respectively.

Figure 1 shows the values of \( A(i) \) and \( B(i) \) for the three IXPs. To determine whether the difference between \( A(i) \) and \( B(i) \) is statistically significant, we used Welch’s t-test [8], which is appropriate for this case as the number of samples for each random variable is different and relatively large. Figure 1 also includes the interval outside of which Welch’s t-test rejects the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05. From early afternoon to early evening, with 95% confidence, we can affirm that the mean normalized traffic is higher in time slots with precipitation than in those without precipitation for all IXPs.

Finally, we observed that the impact of precipitation is not uniform throughout the year. As shown in Figure 2, the relative increase in traffic during the 16h-18h interval is most pronounced in the summer months, while it is insignificant in the winter.

## 4. Conclusions
In this paper, we examined the short-term dependence between internet traffic and weather. While the impact of external factors on other types of utilities has been well-studied, our understanding of such relationships in the internet is still developing. The phenomena observed here contribute to filling this knowledge gap and support our conjecture that measurable external factors are strongly related to the variability of internet traffic. Our work complements other studies that analyze the impact of natural events on the internet [7, 2]. For a more extensive analysis of the impact of weather on internet traffic over both short and long scales, readers are referred to [3].
