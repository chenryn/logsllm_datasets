Abstract. The weather is known to have a major impact on demand
of utilities such as electricity or gas. Given that the Internet usage is
strongly tied with human activity, one could guess the existence of similar
correlation between its traﬃc demand and weather conditions. In this
paper, we empirically quantify such eﬀects. We ﬁnd that the inﬂuence
of precipitation depends on both time of the day as well as time of the
year, and is maximal in the late afternoon over summer months.

Introduction
The analysis and forecasting of the Internet traﬃc is a well studied topic with
a large number of applications [5]. Such studies have used statistical tools to
capture the dominant characteristics of the dynamics, without explicitly mod-
eling the dependence with external factors (e.g. social events, weather) that are
typically accounted as noise. While it has been known that these factors have a
signiﬁcant impact on the demand of utilities [4] or TV ratings [6], their relation-
ship with the Internet traﬃc demand is not well understood. In this paper we
empirically study the relationship between the Internet traﬃc demand and one
of the factors that plays a signiﬁcant role in traﬃc variability: weather.
The interaction between the weather conditions and the traﬃc demand hap-
pens on several timescales. Short term weather events, like precipitations, have
a direct eﬀect on the traﬃc demand. Longer term eﬀects, reﬂected through sea-
sonal changes in temperature and daylight duration, have a slower inﬂuence on
the Internet traﬃc. Here we study the short-term correlations. For the long-
term correlation between the traﬃc and weather and a deeper analysis of the
short-term eﬀects we refer the interested reader to our technical report [3].
2 Datasets Description
As indicator of the Internet traﬃc demand in a particular area we use the traf-
ﬁc data from three Internet eXchange Points (IXP): the Slovak-IX, FICIX and
INEX. We obtained 5-minute granular traﬃc from each IXP by storing and pro-
cessing their publicly available mrtg images. Our Internet traﬃc dataset includes
8 months of data from INEX and 18 months of data from Slovak-IX and FICIX.
Diﬀerent from large IXPs [1], the traﬃc from these IXPs is highly local and thus
appropriate for our analysis.

To obtain weather data, we use the data provided by the Weather Under-
ground, an easily accessible database available at http://www.wunderground.
com/. The wunderground.com publishes a considerable number of weather pa-
rameters with a granularity of 30 minutes. For the sake of this paper, we fetched
from this website the precipitation data for the cities where each IXP is located
over the period that covers our traﬃc data.
3 Short Term Correlations
The data described in Section 2 allows us to notice changes that happen on
the traﬃc of the three localities over short-time scales and compare them to the
weather conditions. For that purpose we split the time into 2-hour time-slots. We
denote by u(t) the total traﬃc transiting through the IXP. In order to remove
the seasonal eﬀects we normalize u(t) with the average traﬃc over a two week
period centered at t:
¯u(t) =
average(u(t − 84), . . . , u(t + 84))
u(t)
.
Thus the normalized traﬃc ¯u(t) measures the variability of the traﬃc on the
short-term timescale, without the impact of long-term seasonality observable in
some regions.
For each 2-hour time-slot t there are 4 or more weather records in our dataset.
We set a binary variable wet(t) to be 1 if any of the weather records reports
precipitation (e.g. snow, shower, rain, storm) otherwise we set wet(t) = 0. This
binary variable helps us simplify the exposition of the results. Our goal is to
examine whether precipitation impacts the traﬃc, and quantify its eﬀect. To that
end, we split the day in twelve 2-hour intervals, and calculate average normalized
traﬃc with and without precipitation for each of the twelve intervals:
A(i) =
mod(s,12)=i
(cid:2)
B(i) =
mod(s,12)=i
(cid:2)
mod(s,12)=i
modd(s,12)=i
thus for the twelve time intervals 0h− 2h, 2h− 4h, . . . , 22h− 24h, A(i) and B(i)
represent the average normalized load in the interval [2ih, (2i + 2)h] with and
without precipitation, respectively.
In Figure 1 we depict the values of A(i) and B(i) for the three IXPs. To de-
termine whether the diﬀerence between A(i) and B(i) is statistically signiﬁcant
to claim that the means of the samples with and without precipitation are diﬀer-
ent, we use Welch’s t-test [8], which is well-suited for this case as the number of
samples for each random variable is diﬀerent and relatively large. Figure 1 also
includes the interval outside of which Welch’s t-test rejects the null-hypothesis
for a signiﬁcance level of 0.05. Thus from early afternoon to early evening, with
95% of conﬁdence we can aﬃrm for all IXPs that the mean normalized traﬃc
is larger in timeslots with precipitation than in timeslots without precipitation.

Fig. 2. The relative change with precipitation during the 16h − 18h slot over the year
For the other periods of the day, the diﬀerence between the means is not statis-
tically signiﬁcant to support that precipitation impacts the traﬃc.
Finally, we observe that the impact of precipitation is not uniform across
the year. Namely, in Figure 2 we depict the relative increment of precipitation
during the 16h − 18h interval for the 6 two-month periods and observe that the
impact of precipitation is most pronounced in the summer months, while it is
insigniﬁcant over the winter.
4 Conclusions
In this paper we examined the dependence between the Internet traﬃc and the
weather in short scales. While for other types of utilities the impact of external
factors has been studied in depth, our understanding on such relationship in
the Internet is very immature. The phenomena observed here is a step towards
ﬁlling that knowledge gap and aﬃrms our conjecture that measurable external
factors are strongly related with the variability of the Internet traﬃc. Our work
complements other studies that analyze the impact of natural events on the
Internet [7,2]. We refer the reader to [3] for a more extensive analysis of the
impact of weather in Internet traﬃc over short and long scales.
