## Discussion

In this section, we discuss AEOLUS’s susceptibility to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, its potential use in a layered VDS security solution, and as a security indicator, along with future work.

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

An adversary can launch a type of DoS attack called signal jamming on AEOLUS-enabled VDS by injecting acoustic waves with characteristic frequencies and amplitudes similar to AEOLUS. This type of attack can be countered by frequently changing AEOLUS’s operating frequency range, making it difficult for an attacker to predict the operating frequency at a given time and launch an effective real-time signal jamming attack. A more sophisticated adversary could potentially inject acoustic waves across the entire spectrum of audible frequencies and amplitudes. Unlike common DoS attacks (e.g., link-flooding attacks [37, 42] in the network security domain), which are often challenging to pinpoint, such an attack can be easily detected and mitigated. This is because the adversary would use the same frequency range as AEOLUS (i.e., human audible frequencies), and these frequencies can be captured and analyzed without requiring additional hardware.

When multiple AEOLUS-enabled VDS devices are used in close proximity, they may accidentally cause a DoS scenario. A potential solution could be a negotiable frequency range assignment (either centralized or decentralized) for different VDS devices to ensure they use different frequency ranges and nonces. Another reactive prevention method could be to allow AEOLUS to change its operating frequency range if a DoS situation is detected.

### Layered VDS Security

AEOLUS is designed to prevent speech reuse as a security overlay. When used in conjunction with other security mechanisms, AEOLUS can greatly enhance VDS usability as a passive and near-imperceptible defense mechanism. For example, active liveness detection methods such as audio CAPTCHA [50] or challenge-response methods, which require users to respond with dynamic words or passphrases, provide additional security but add friction from a usability standpoint, especially for short user interaction sessions. A potential risk-based layered approach could proactively use the proposed framework in every user interaction and invoke challenge-response methods to mitigate transaction risk as necessary.

### Use as a Security Indicator

The proposed framework is designed to embed near-imperceptible acoustic nonces in the human audible frequency range. However, it can be tailored for use as a slightly perceptible security indicator, similar to electric vehicle warning sounds [46] or the light ring [17, 33] used in Amazon Echo devices. The presence of a gentle perceptible noise during user interaction could indicate to the user that the interaction session with VDS (e.g., Amazon Alexa) is secured using AEOLUS.

### Future Work

In the future, we will conduct in-depth investigations into methods for generating and encoding acoustic nonces, e.g., using variations of music or other forms of sound along with different encoding schemes. We also plan to conduct large-scale live subject testing to further evaluate reliability and imperceptibility. To address the scenario where clean speech can be obtained by an adversary, we will investigate both passive strategies, such as using acoustic environment identification techniques to detect voice commands recorded in different environments, and active strategies, such as prompting users to speak a session-specific random number in voice commands.

## Summary

In this work, we present a security overlay called AEOLUS that can be integrated with any voice-driven services to prevent speech reuse. AEOLUS reliably embeds a dynamic acoustic nonce that is non-disruptive to a VDS user and detects the embedded nonce from the recorded user speech. Experiments conducted in three different environments show that AEOLUS can be used in operational VDS scenarios with minimal overhead.
