6 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss AEOLUS’s susceptibility to Denail of Ser-
vice (DoS) attacks, its potential use in a layered VDS security solu-
tion and as a security indicator, and future work.
Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks. An adversary can launch a type
of DoS attack called signal jamming on AEOLUS-enabled VDS by
injecting acoustic waves with characteristic frequencies and am-
plitudes similar to AEOLUS’s. However, this type of attack can be
countered by frequently changing AEOLUS’s operating frequency
range. This would make it difficult for an attacker to predict the
operating frequency at a given time and consequently launch ef-
fective real-time signal jamming attack. A smarter adversary can
potentially inject acoustic waves in the entire spectrum of audible
frequencies and amplitudes. Unlike common DoS attacks (e.g., link-
flooding attacks [37, 42] in the network security domain) where it
is usually challenging to pinpoint the attack, such an attack can be
easily detected and mitigated. This is because to conduct the attack,
the adversary would use the same frequency range as AEOLUS’s (i.e.,
human audible frequencies), and these frequencies can be captured
and analyzed without requiring any extra hardware.
Multiple AEOLUS-enabled VDS devices used around the same
time in each other’s neighborhood may accidentally result in a
DoS scenario. A potential way to prevent this could be through
a negotiable frequency range assignment (either centralized or
decentralized) for different VDS devices to ensure they use different
frequency ranges and nonce. Another reactive prevention method
could be to allow AEOLUS to change its operating frequency range
if a DoS situation is detected.
Layered VDS Security. AEOLUS is designed to prevent speech re-
use as a security overlay. When used in conjunction with other
security mechanisms, AEOLUS can greatly enhance VDS usabil-
ity as a passive and near-imperceptible defense mechanism. Con-
sider, for example, active liveness detection methods such as au-
dio CAPTCHA [50] or challenge-response methods which require
users to respond with dynamic words or passphrases. Although
such methods provide additional security, they add friction from
a usability standpoint, especially for short user interaction ses-
sions. A potential risk-based layered approach could proactively
use the proposed framework in every user interaction, and invoke
challenge-response, to mitigate transaction risk as necessary.
Use as security indicator. The proposed framework is designed
to embed near-imperceptible acoustic nonce in the human audible
frequency range. However, it can be tailored for use as a slightly
perceptible security indicator similar to electric vehicle warning

sound [46] or the light ring [17, 33] used in Amazon Echo devices.
Presence of a gentle perceptible noise at the time of user interaction
could indicate to the user that the interaction session with VDS
(e.g., Amazon Alexa) is secured using AEOLUS.
Future Work. In future, we will conduct in-depth investigation
of methods for generation and encoding of acoustic nonce, e.g.,
using variations of music or other forms of sound along with dif-
ferent encoding schemes. We also plan to conduct large-scale live
subject testing to further evaluate reliability and imperceptibility.
To address the scenario when clean speech can be obtained by an
adversary, we will investigate both passive strategies, e.g., use of
acoustic environment identification techniques to detect a voice
command recorded in a different environment, and active strategies,
e.g., prompting users to speak a session-specific random number in
voice commands.
7 SUMMARY
In this work, we present a security overlay called AEOLUS that can
be integrated with any voice-driven services to prevent speech
re-use. AEOLUS reliably embeds a dynamic acoustic nonce that is
non-disruptive to a VDS user, and detects the embedded nonce from
the recorded user speech. Experiments conducted in three different
environments show that AEOLUS can be used in operational VDS
scenarios with minimal overhead.
