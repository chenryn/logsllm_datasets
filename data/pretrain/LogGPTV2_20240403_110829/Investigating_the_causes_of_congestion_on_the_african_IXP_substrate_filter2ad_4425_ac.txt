GHANATEL was the ISP providing the required transit services
through a 100 Mbps link, whereas its clients were served by its main
peering link of 1 Gbps size. The 100 Mbps transit link was the one
identified by our measurements as suffering from congestion. Thus,
GHANATEL users [6] were likely not directly impacted during
phase 1.
The amplitude of the waveform then dropped to 10 ms from
15/06/2016 to 06/08/2016 (the date from which our latency probes
to the far end were unsuccessful): we term this phase 2 (figure 2a).
The beginning of this period coincides with the shutdown of the
transit service. The IXP operator explained that GHANATEL shut
off the transit service to force the IXP to pay for it. GHANATEL then
used that link for peering until early October, leaving the GGCs
non-functional. We observed a diurnal pattern confirmed by the
loss rate increase during that phase (figure 2b). Though figure 2b
depicts loss rate up to 25%, our measurements show that loss rate
varied between 0% and 85% between 21/07/2016 and 06/08/2017. We
conjecture that during phase 2, GHANATEL end-users may have
been affected by the congested peering link; in addition, all end-
users of networks peering at GIXA may also have been affected by
the detour of their packets while accessing Google content, which
was no longer cached at the IXP.

Figure 3: RTTs and losses GIXA–KNET
In early October, GHANATEL stopped using the problematic
link. This corresponds to a change made by the IXP wherein they
started using an intercontinental ISP as a transit provider for the
GGC with a higher capacity link of 620 Mbps; the IXP is now paying
for the transit services and members of the IXP are now required
to register in order to access content. This policy change led to the
decrease in the number of peers connected to the content network
as noted in §6.1 and in Table 2.
Finally, we noticed that in both phases, the elevation in far-end
RTTs correlates with days of the week. For phase 1, the five large
spikes correspond to the business days, whereas the rest, to those
of the weekend (figure 1). As congestion events occurred till the
shutdown of the link, the congestion was sustained.
GIXA — KNET
We now consider the link GIXA–KNET, for which figure 3 presents
RTTs to both ends of the link, along with the loss rates. To begin
with, KNET delivers high quality video, data, and voice solutions
throughout West and Central Africa [23]. Its link with GIXA was
discovered by bdrmap on 29/06/2016. From 06/08/2016, RTTs to the
far end present a diurnal waveform, while those to the near end
remain constant and stay below 1 ms (figure 3a). We observed the
same pattern consistently until the end of our measurements for a
total of approximately 8 months. The analysis of record route (RR)
probes during that period provided evidence of route symmetry
for the duration of our measurements. After that, we evaluated the
characteristics of the waveform to find that Aw is 17.5 ms, while
∆tU D is of 2 hours 14 min after level shifts sanitization i.e., a single
congestion event lasts roughly 2 hours.
One might assume, since we started seeing evidence of conges-
tion on the GIXA–KNET link on the same day (06/08/2016) as the
link GIXA–GHANATEL disappeared, that there is a causal relation-
ship between the two events. Further investigation showed that
this was not the case: although KNET has a regional footprint, it
does not provide transit. On 06/10/2016, during the GIXA operator
interview, the operator told us that they did not believe the KNET
port at the IXP was congested. In such a context, there may be other
causes for the observed phenomemon, which would need coopera-
tion with KNET to investigate fully: (i) whether the KNET router is
overloaded at peak times, resulting in slow ICMP responses or (ii)
whether the link with the GIXA content network is congested.
On 05/05/2017, KNET informed the IXP that they are not ex-
periencing congestion, and expressed that they have not received
any complaints from their customers accessing content. The lack
of complaints may be explained by the fact that the average loss
rate measured on the link from 21/07/2016 to 29/03/2017 (figure
3b) is low (0.1 %). The observed pattern is the same regardless of
the type of the day (business or not). It shows an obvious decrease
everyday around midnight, an increase at different times of the day,
and a constant RTT value around 20 ms in the afternoon. As this
pattern is observed till the end of the campaign, the phenomenon
was sustained.
6.2.2 Case seen from VP4 in QCELL at SIXP: QCELL–NETPAGE.
VP4 is hosted within QCELL (AS37309), a SIXP member. Previously,
Fanou et al. [13] found in August 2014 (a month after the launch
of SIXP) that RTTs between QCELL and NETPAGE were constant
around 1.5 ms. However, we noticed that the RTTs across that link
showed repeating diurnal patterns from 29/02/2016 to 28/04/2016
(phase 1, shown in Figure 4a) indicating congestion on the link.
From 28/04/2016 to 30/03/2017, the diurnal waveform disappeared
and most RTT values were below 10 ms (phase 2).
While interviewing the SIXP operator, we were told that during
phase 1, the demand to access the GGCs (for which QCELL provides
transit) from NETPAGE was huge: NETPAGE’s engineers noticed
that high bandwidth usage by Google traffic from their users was
degrading performance and causing congestion. They thus asked
for an upgrade of their link with SIXP from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps.
After the upgrade (done on 28/04/2016 according to our data), the
congestion events disappeared and were not evident until the end of
the measurement period (figure 4b). We believe NETPAGE’s users
may have been affected by these congestion events.

(e.g., VP1), or on an under-provisioned link connecting a Google
cache to one of the IXP peers (e.g., VP4). High demand appears to be
the main cause in the last scenario. In the two first cases, congestion
was sustained; in the case of the link GIXA–GHANATEL, there
was a dispute between the two parties, while in the case of the
GIXA–KNET link, the low packet loss on the link likely meant that
end-users were not severely impacted and hence the ISP did not
upgrade the link.
As for implications for network/IXP operators, we learned that
(i) when considering links at IXPs, links used to access content are
susceptible to congestion; hence, they need to be monitored more
carefully, and (ii) local IXP operators willing to host content caches
must be aware that they need transit services to be functional;
such a situation may lead to dispute with the provider if not well
managed; e.g., in case of increase in the demand without any update
of the Service level Agreement or if demand increase is combined
with a free provision of transit services.
8 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We investigated the causes of congestion and measured its impact
on the African IXP substrate using vantage points deployed at six
strategically selected IXPs in Africa. While we detected cases of
congestion at four IXPs, we did not find evidence of widespread
congestion; only 2.2% of the discovered links experienced conges-
tion during our measurement period. We then detailed the most
interesting case studies and discussed the implications for both
research and network operations. Although our findings regarding
the causes of congestion at IXPs may apply to IXPs in other regions,
we prefer not to attempt to generalize them beyond what we could
directly observe and validate with the operators.
Since an IXP only monitors ports sizes/traffic or ensures up-
grades upon requests from ISPs, it is important that ISPs carefully
monitor their peering links at IXPs to avoid or to quickly mitigate
congestion (as noticed for VP4). We plan to continue deploying
additional Ark probes at networks and IXPs operating in developed
and developing regions, including Africa, to increase our coverage
of the African sub-regions that have not received much attention
so far. Meanwhile, we plan to keep analyzing collected TSLP data
to delve into the dynamics and causes of congestion at IXP infras-
tructure, and compare the results with those obtained in this work.
Finally, it will be interesting to correlate our observations from
TSLP measurements with data from the IXP operators. To this end,
we are working on strengthening our relationship with operators
in the region to make such a study feasible in the future.

Regarding the characteristics of the waveform, the average mag-
nitude Aw of the level shift during phase 1 was 10.7 ms, with a
periodicity of approximately 1 day. Moreover, congestion events
lasted on average a third of the duration of those registered during
phase 1 for the link GIXA–GHANATEL (§6.2.1), since ∆tU D was 6
hours 22 min. Finally, we noticed that the waveform was the same
over weeks (figure 4a) with a spike corresponding to each day. The
height of the spike reached 35 ms in the week, whereas it stayed
around 15 ms during the weekends. The reasons behind this may
be increased access to Google content for daily activities combined
with communications among clients of both ISPs during business
days as compared to weekends.
7 IMPLICATIONS OF OUR RESULTS
In this section, we highlight the takeaways of our work and discuss
the implications for research and network operations.
A key takeaway of our study is that we observed congestion on
only a small fraction of the monitored links during this measure-
ment period. However, we also noted that the IXP ecosystem is
highly dynamic in Africa, as ISP presence at IXPs, policies employed
by the IXPs themselves, and the presence of content providers can
change over time. Further, with the push for peering in the African
region, it is likely that the IXP substrate will become more mature
in the future, supporting more peering between interconnected
networks and hence increased traffic volumes. All these factors
motivate the need for longitudinal measurement and monitoring
of this evolving infrastructure.
We showed that the TSLP technique can detect congestion with-
out requiring access to data from network operators. However, we
emphasize that judicious interpretation of the causes of the observed
congestion events requires collaboration and validation from the
stakeholders, as these are often related to hidden events that are not
made public. We found congestion on a link used to update Google
caches hosted at the IXP, on a link used by an ISP to peer at the IXP
