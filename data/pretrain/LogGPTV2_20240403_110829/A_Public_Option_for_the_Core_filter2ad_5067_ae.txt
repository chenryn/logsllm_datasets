CSP can set 𝑝𝑠 to maximize its revenue:
𝑝∗
𝑠 = argmax
{𝑝𝑠 𝐷𝑠 (𝑝𝑠)}
𝑝𝑠
∫ ∞
In the NN regime, this is the end of the story: LMPs have their
customers, CSPs set their prices to maximize revenue, and there are
no complications. The resulting social welfare (the sum over user
utilities) is merely: 
𝑣𝑠𝑑𝐹 (𝑣𝑠)
𝑝∗
𝑠
𝑠
Note that the social welfare is monotonically decreasing in the
𝑠 ; every increase in price 𝑝𝑠 potentially causes some con-
prices 𝑝∗
sumers to not purchase the service 𝑠.
4.4 LMPs unilaterally set fees
We now turn to the unregulated (UR) scenario where termination
fees are allowed. We consider two possible ways these fees can be
set: unilaterally (in this subsection) and through bargaining (in the
next subsection).
We have assumed that, in the short term, each LMP is a monopoly
provider for its users. One way of modeling these fees is to assume
that each LMP can unilaterally set the fees for each CSP to reach its
customers (since, in the short term, there is no other way of reaching
them). This fee-setting behavior of the LMP results in the so-called
“double marginalization” process [49]. Charged a fee 𝑡𝑠 per customer,
CSP 𝑠 chooses a revenue-maximizing price 𝑝∗
𝑠 (𝑡𝑠). Given that the
revenue per customer is now 𝑝𝑠 − 𝑡𝑠, the revenue-maximizing price
is given by:
𝑝∗
𝑠 (𝑡𝑠) = argmax
{(𝑝𝑠 − 𝑡𝑠)𝐷𝑠 (𝑝𝑠)}
𝑝𝑠
(1)
Note that with sufficient smoothness and convexity conditions, the
maximizing price 𝑝∗
𝑠 (𝑡𝑠) can be shown to be strictly increasing in 𝑡𝑠.
LEMMA 1. If 𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠) is strictly positive with continuous first and
𝑠(𝑝𝑠)  0), and asymptotically vanishes (lim𝑝𝑠→∞ 𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠) =
𝑠(𝑡𝑠) > 0.
Proof: Since 𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠) maximizes (𝑝𝑠 −𝑡𝑠)𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠) it must satisfy the
equations (i) 𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠) > 𝑡𝑠, (ii) 𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠)) + (𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠) − 𝑡𝑠)𝐷′(𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠)) =
𝑠(𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠)) + (𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠) − 𝑡𝑠)𝐷′′(𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠)) ≤ 0. Taking the
0, and (iii) 2𝐷′
derivative of equation (ii) and rearranging yields
𝑝′
𝑠(𝑡𝑠)[2𝐷′(𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠)) + (𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠) − 𝑡𝑠)𝐷′′
𝑠 (𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠))] = 𝐷′
𝑠(𝑝𝑠(𝑡𝑠))
Equation (iii) tells us that the left hand bracket is negative, and we
know the right hand side is negative, so 𝑝′
𝑠(𝑡𝑠) must be positive.
Thus, as the termination fees 𝑡𝑠 increase, the prices 𝑝𝑠 increase,
so the social welfare decreases. We can therefore conclude that
termination fees strictly decrease social welfare.
Returning to the unilateral scenario, knowing how CSP 𝑠 will set
its price, the LMP chooses the fee 𝑡𝑠 to maximize its revenue:
(cid:8)𝑡𝑠 𝐷𝑠(cid:0)𝑝∗
𝑠 (𝑡𝑠)(cid:1)(cid:9) .
𝑡∗
𝑠 = argmax
𝑡𝑠
Of course, each LMP independently chooses the fee that they
charge, but they all do the same calculation (for each CSP), so the
result is uniform termination fees 𝑡𝑠 across all LMPs. This process
is referred to as “double marginalization” because the CSP and then
the LMP are maximizing revenue in sequence.
4.5 Bilateral Bargaining
Modeling the LMP as imposing fees unilaterally on every content
provider neglects the fact that both the LMP and the CSP may
have some degree of bargaining power. The LMP can ask for a
termination fee 𝑡𝑠 or else they will block the CSP. The CSP can
threaten to walk away from the deal, leaving the LMP’s customers
without the services offered by that CSP. This situation is similar
to many other bilateral monopolies where a bilateral bargaining
approach has provided sharp insights; for example, cable providers
bargain with content providers over how much they pay to show a
particular channel (e.g., Comcast and ESPN have to negotiate the
fees that Comcast pays to ESPN, see [14]). Another situation is the
negotiation between health insurers and local hospitals, where the
insurance company acts as a gatekeeper between hospital and patient,
see [29]. In such settings, two parties negotiate and eventually arrive
at an agreement.
Rather than explicitly modelling the entire extensive form of the
game that represents the complex strategic environment involved
in such negotiations, the economic analysis has typically adopted
a cooperative solution concept that satisfies a number of axiomatic
requirements. We shall follow this approach here and adopt the Nash
bargaining solution (NBS) [41]. This cooperative solution concept
can be given non-cooperative and fully strategic foundations, as
established by [46]. More relevant for our purposes here, the Nash
bargaining solution can be fully extended to bargaining environments
with many participants and externalities across environment and
agreements, as established recently in [12]. For the present purpose,
it will suffice to restrict attention to the bilateral bargaining solution.
The NBS can be defined as follows. There are two agents with
utility functions 𝑢 and 𝑣, and a feasible set of outcomes 𝐹 and a dis-
agreement point 𝑑 that represents the outcome when the players do
not come to agreement. Then the NBS outcome is the outcome that
maximizes the product of the utility differences between agreement

and disagreement:
argmax
𝑥∈𝐹
{(𝑢(𝑥) − 𝑢(𝑑))(𝑣(𝑥) − 𝑣(𝑑))} .
We consider a series of three models using NBS, with increasing
levels of complexity. First, we consider a single CSP 𝑠 and a single
LMP 𝑙 who are bargaining over the termination fee. Since this is
a bilateral negotiation, it does not affect the fees 𝑡𝑠 being charged
by other LMPs, so we assume that CSP 𝑠 keeps its price 𝑝𝑠 fixed
regardless of the outcome of this negotiation (recall that we assume
CSPs charge global prices that do not depend on the LMP of the
user). In what follows, we focus only on the revenue per customer
in LMP 𝑙. If they come to agreement on a fee 𝑡𝑠, then 𝑠 obtains
𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠)(𝑝𝑠 − 𝑡𝑠) and 𝑙 obtains 𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠)𝑡𝑠. If they disagree, then 𝑠 gets
no revenue from customers of 𝑙, and 𝑙 loses some fraction 𝑟𝑠
𝑙 of
customers who used to also be customers of 𝑠 (those who were never
customers of 𝑠 are presumably unaffected by the fact that 𝑠 is no
longer offered on 𝑙’s network), and recall that these customers were
paying an access charge 𝑐𝑙 to the LMP. The loss 𝑠 suffers at the
disagreement point is 𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠)(𝑝𝑠 − 𝑡𝑠)) and the loss suffered by 𝑙 is
𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠)(𝑡𝑠 + 𝑟𝑠
𝑐𝑙).
𝑙
Thus, the quantity the NBS maximizes is:
[𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠)(𝑝𝑠 − 𝑡𝑠)][𝐷𝑠(𝑝𝑠)(𝑡𝑠 + 𝑟𝑠
𝑙 𝑐𝑙)]
Taking the derivative with respect to 𝑡𝑠 of this expression and setting
the result to zero shows that the transfer payment that maximizes the
product of the gains from agreement is:
𝑝𝑠 − 𝑟𝑠
𝑐𝑙
2
𝑡𝑠 =
,
𝑙
We therefore take this as the negotiated fee 𝑡𝑠. Note that the fee is de-
creasing in the rate 𝑟𝑠
𝑙 at which customers leave 𝑙 when negotiations
with service 𝑠 break down. Moreover, the fee can be negative (𝑙 pays
𝑠) when the loss suffered at the disagreement point by 𝑙 is greater
than the loss suffered by 𝑠. However, in what follows we assume we
are in the regime where the termination fees are positive.
The key parameter here is 𝑟𝑠
𝑙 , which is the rate at which the LMP
𝑙 loses customers when 𝑠 is no longer offered on its network. For
a given 𝑠, 𝑟𝑠
𝑙 will presumably be smaller if 𝑙 is a well-established
incumbent than if it is a newly established LMP with a smaller
market share. This means that well-established LMPs can extract
more in termination fees than smaller ones, giving them a substantial
competitive advantage.
Similarly, for a given 𝑙, 𝑟𝑠
𝑙 will presumably be larger if 𝑠 is a
well-established CSP than if it is a newly established one. This again
gives a significant competitive advantage to CSPs with large market
share, because they can pay less in termination fees.
While the exact values of 𝑟𝑠
𝑙 and the specific nature of the demand
curves 𝐷𝑠 are empirical matters that will determine the quantitative
impact of allowing termination fees, it is clear that such fees will
systematically favor established incumbents in both the LMP and
CSP markets.
The above model focused only on one bilateral negotiation, but
all the LMPs will want to extract what they can from each CSP. In
our second model applying the bargaining approach, we account for
the presence of these other fees. We find that the weighted average

𝑙
In our third and final model based on bargaining, we note that
when faced with a set of termination fees from all LMPs, each
CSP 𝑠 will modify its price 𝑝𝑠 so as to maximize revenue given
these fees. This revenue-maximizing price is given by 𝑝∗
) in
Equation 1. After changing the price 𝑝𝑠 the termination fees 𝑡𝑠 will
be renegotiated, and so on. Based on our earlier analysis of NBS, we
eventually reach an equilibrium where the following equation holds:
𝑠 (𝑡𝑎𝑣𝑒

.
The core result here is that when we allow termination fees, the
prices 𝑝𝑠 increase with the imposed fees, which then decreases social
welfare. While the price increase (due to termination fees) faced by
the consumer will likely be less under bilateral bargaining than under
unilateral fee setting, it will still result in a lower social welfare
than the NN case. More importantly, incumbent CSPs and ISPs
will have a significant competitive advantage over emerging ones:
incumbent ISPs can negotiate higher termination fees than emerging
ones, and incumbent CSPs can negotiate smaller termination fees
than emerging ones. This is the reason we strongly favor the network
neutrality regime over the unregulated scenario.
These conclusions are intuitive, but we are not aware of a result
in the literature that derives them cleanly from such a simple model.
4.6 Related Literature on Network Neutrality
While the past two decades has seen an active debate about net
neutrality, the economics literature on net neutrality is still in de-
velopment, see [25, 34] for quick introductions and [3, 16, 54] for
further reading. In particular, we lack a solid empirical understanding
of the key economic trade-offs being made by LMPs and CSPs, so
most of the theoretical investigations involve simple models similar
to what we have just presented.
The network neutrality literature is too broad and varied to give a
complete review of it here, so instead we review the aspects where
our treatment differs from major portions of the general literature.
We start by describing ways in which our general approach differs,
and then describe some more technical differences.
Our first significant difference from a major portion of the net-
work neutrality literature is that we focus on maximizing social
welfare, whereas optimizing consumer welfare is sometimes used in
arguments for network neutrality [34]. Social welfare is (in our set-
ting) the total utility users derive from network services, ignoring the
payments they have made for those services (since those payments
just increase the utility of others), while consumer welfare takes
those payments into account because it focuses on the net welfare
(utility minus payments) of the users.
Thus, we are ignoring the distribution of that welfare (between
users and CSPs and LMPs). We do this because we view innovation
as the most important way to grow social welfare in the long-term,
and enabling a more competitive market does that. As a byproduct,
vigorous competition in the LMP and CSP market tends to drive
SIGCOMM ’20, August 10–14, 2020, Virtual Event, NY, USA

most of the value into consumer welfare (since payments decrease).
Thus, while NN has both higher social welfare and fairer competition
than UR, we view the latter as more important than the former.
Our second important difference is that many works on network
