### Fragmented DNS Response Analysis

Following a DNS response, we send an ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) error, indicating different Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) values, and then repeat the request. We verify if the response arrives in fragments according to the MTU value specified in the ICMP error message. Our evaluations were conducted with MTU values of 1280, 576, 296, and 68 bytes.

**Figure 4 (Left)** shows the cumulative distribution of fragmented packet sizes received after sending the ICMP PTB. The right side of the figure displays the percentage of domains where at least one nameserver supported an MTU smaller than the plotted size. As observed, for more than 90% of the domains with PMTUD-configured nameservers, at least one nameserver is willing to reduce the fragment size (in response to ICMP PTB) to almost 548 bytes. For approximately 35% of the domains, the reduction is to 296 bytes, and for 10%, it is to 68 bytes. This flexibility allows for inducing fragmentation to any desired size. Our evaluations in Section 4.5 indicate that 11,964 RIR customer accounts (13.6%) and 2,352 Alexa domain holder accounts (22.2%) are vulnerable to the FragDNS attack.

### Attacker Success Probability

We analyze the attacker's success probability in crafting a spoofed second fragment with the correct UDP checksum and IPID value. To compute the success rate for hitting the correct UDP checksum, we performed the following evaluation: For each customer domain in our dataset, we queried the nameservers multiple times, sending the same DNS request (with the domain of the customerâ€™s email and type MX). We checked if the DNS responses from the nameservers contained the same DNS records and the same order of DNS records during each iteration. The computation of the UDP checksum for each domain is described in pseudocode in Algorithm 1. Our evaluation shows that for 1,748 domains, the success rate was high.

### Evaluation Results

**Figure 4 (Right)** provides a visual representation of the results. It shows the percentage of domains where at least one nameserver supported an MTU smaller than the plotted size. The figure indicates that a significant number of domains are susceptible to fragmentation attacks, as their nameservers can be induced to reduce the fragment size to very small values.

### Conclusion

Our findings suggest that a substantial number of RIR and Alexa domain holder accounts are vulnerable to the FragDNS attack. The ability to induce fragmentation to any desired size, combined with a high success rate in crafting spoofed fragments, highlights the need for enhanced security measures to mitigate this vulnerability.
