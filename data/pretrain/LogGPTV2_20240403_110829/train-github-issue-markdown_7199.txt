### Apache Airflow Version
2.5.1

### Issue Description
When using a dynamically generated task that retrieves expanded data from XCom after a branch task, the graph does not render properly. The graph reappears only after the DAG run is completed. This issue has been observed with both `BashOperator` and `KubernetesPodOperator`.

The developer console in the browser displays the following error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

The grid view renders correctly.

### Expected Behavior
The graph should be rendered correctly during the DAG run.

### Steps to Reproduce
```python
def branch_dynamic_flow():
    @branch_task
    def choose_path():
        return 'b'

    @task
    def a():
        print('a')

    @task
    def get_args():
        return ['echo 1', 'echo 2']

    b = BashOperator.partial(task_id="b").expand(bash_command=get_args())
    path = choose_path()
    path >> a()
    path >> b
```
