### Apache Airflow version
2.5.1
### What happened
when using a dynamically generated task that gets the expand data from xcom
after a branch_task the graph doesn't render.  
It reappears once the dag run is finished.  
tried with BashOperator and a KubernetesPodOperator.
the developer console in the browser shows the error:  
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length') at

grid view renders fine.
### What you think should happen instead
graph should be rendered.
### How to reproduce
    def branch_dynamic_flow():
        @branch_task
        def choose_path():
            return 'b'
        @task
        def a():
            print('a')
        @task
        def get_args():
            return ['echo 1', 'echo 2']
        b = BashOperator.partial(task_id="b").expand(bash_command=get_args())
        path = choose_path()
        path >> a()
        path >> b
