Abstract—Medical Cyber-physical Systems (MCPS) are vul-
nerable to accidental or malicious faults that can target their
controllers and cause safety hazards and harm to patients. This
paper proposes a combined model and data-driven approach for
designing context-aware monitors that can detect early signs of
hazards and mitigate them in MCPS. We present a framework
for formal speciﬁcation of unsafe system context using Signal
Temporal Logic (STL) combined with an optimization method
for patient-speciﬁc reﬁnement of STL formulas based on real or
simulated faulty data from the closed-loop system for the gener-
ation of monitor logic. We evaluate our approach in simulation
using two state-of-the-art closed-loop Artiﬁcial Pancreas Systems
(APS). The results show the context-aware monitor achieves up
to 1.4 times increase in average hazard prediction accuracy (F1-
score) over several baseline monitors, reduces false-positive and
false-negative rates, and enables hazard mitigation with a 54%
success rate while decreasing the average risk for patients.

I. INTRODUCTION
Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) are increasingly
deployed in various safety-critical diagnostic and therapeutic
applications. Recent studies have shown the susceptibility of
medical devices, such as patient monitors, infusion pumps,
implantable pacemakers, and surgical robots to accidental
faults or malicious attacks with potential adverse impacts on
patients [1]–[7]. Although leveraging correct-by-construction
techniques like formal methods, model-based design, and
automated synthesis can improve the resilience of CPS, they
are still vulnerable to residual faults and attacks that can evade
even the most rigorous design and veriﬁcation methods and
appear during run time.
Run-time veriﬁcation of safety properties based on formal
models of systems has been an active area of research in
safety-critical systems [8]–[11]. However, these approaches
often rely on ad-hoc safety properties and do not account for
cyber-physical system interactions and the multi-dimensional
context
in the CPS. Recent works on anomaly detection
in CPS rely on complex dynamic models of physical sys-
tem/environment [12] [6] and/or human operator actions [13],
[14] for improved detection accuracy and latency [15]. But
developing such dynamic models for MCPS is challenging
because of the variety of patient proﬁles and unpredictable
changes in the human body over time.
Great efforts have also been made to improve the MCPS
safety and security using online monitoring and anomaly
detection, including model-based approaches [16], [17], proba-
bilistic models [18], fuzzy logic-based algorithms [19], invari-
ant detection techniques [13], [20], and machine learning [14].
However, most of these solutions do not provide the ability for
early detection of safety property violations, which would help
with the prevention of hazards.
In this paper, we propose a methodology for designing
context-aware safety monitors that can detect early signs of
safety hazards in MCPS by identifying potentially unsafe
cyber-physical interactions. Our method combines the formal
speciﬁcation of safety context for run-time monitoring of the
MCPS controller’s actions with the data-driven optimization
of the monitor’s logic based on real or simulated patient data
to predict impending hazards. What differentiates our method
from previous context-aware monitoring solutions [13], [14],
[21] is combining domain knowledge with data to improve
detection accuracy, timeliness, and transparency. Our proposed
monitor can be integrated with the control software of a target
MCPS and only requires access to its input-output interface
(sensor and actuator values). We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach with a case study of Artiﬁcial Pancreas
Systems (APS) used for diabetes management.
The main contributions of the paper are as follows:
• Proposing a framework for formal speciﬁcation of safety
context for hazard prediction and mitigation in MCPS
(Section III). This framework closes the gap between design-
time hazard analysis and run-time safety monitoring and
enables the generation of template signal temporal logic
(STL) formulas for run-time identiﬁcation of unsafe control
actions that potentially lead to hazards.
• Developing a data-driven method for patient-speciﬁc reﬁne-
ment of the STL formulas and their translation into monitor
logic based on real or simulated faulty data collected from
the closed-loop MCPS (Section III-C2). Our method uses
the L-BFGS-B [22] optimization algorithm with a tight
exponential loss function for learning patient-speciﬁc pa-
rameters in the monitor logic. It shows improved tightness
and convergence rate compared to a previous STL learning
method and achieves better prediction accuracy compared
to traditional machine learning techniques.
• Developing an open-source environment for experimental
evaluation of different monitors in terms of timely and ac-
curate prediction of hazards for the case study of APS (Fig.
5a). This environment integrates two different APS con-
trollers, OpenAPS [23] and Basal-Bolus [24], with widely-
used patient glucose simulators, Glucosym [25] and UVA-

Cumulative Sum Control Chart (CUSUM) [29]), or well-
trained ML models [30] [31] [32]. However, if the attacks
do not exhibit malicious behaviors until the controller has
received the sensor data, or accidental and malicious faults
directly compromise the controller software or hardware func-
tionality, the techniques mentioned above will fail to detect
them. This is probable given the existing vulnerabilities in the
communication channels of devices [6] [33] and recent trends
towards open-source [34] and mobile and app-based [35] [36]
controllers. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by
focusing on the faults/attacks targeting the controller itself.
Hazard Prediction: Our goal is to detect potentially unsafe
control commands issued by an MCPS controller, regardless
of their originating causes, and stop or mitigate them before
execution on the actuators to prevent safety hazards. This is
based on the observation that there is a time gap from the
activation of the fault and generation of erroneous control
commands in the cyber layer until the occurrence of a haz-
ardous state in the physical layer [6] leading to an accident
(Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1a, we propose to integrate a
safety monitor with a target MCPS controller as a wrapper
that only has access to the input-output interface for observing
the sensor data and actuator commands and making context
inference. The proposed monitor evaluates whether the control
action issued by the controller given the inferred context might
result in any hazards and stops delivering unsafe commands
by issuing corrective actions to mitigate hazards. We assume
the sensor data received by the controller and the monitor
are fault-free or protected using existing methods mentioned
above. We also assume the monitor has a much simpler logic
than the controller, so it will be easier and less expensive
to be veriﬁed and made tamper-proof (e.g., using protective
memories or hardware isolation [37] [38]).
Context-Aware Monitoring: A simple algorithm for the
proposed monitor might involve checking the values of control
commands based on ad-hoc safety rules or medical guide-
lines [16]. However, such a generic monitoring mechanism
does not consider the current cyber-physical system status
and the patient’s dynamics and might incorrectly classify safe
commands, leading to a large number of false alarms or missed
detection and potential harm to patients [6] [1] [39].
Safety, as an emergent property of CPS,
is context-
dependent and should be controlled by enforcing a set of
constraints on the system’s behavior and control actions given
the current system state [13], [14], [40]. Previous works on
anomaly detection in CPS have shown that considering the
multi-dimensional system context, including human, cyber,
and physical systems’ status,
leads to improved detection
accuracy and latency [6], [14], [15], [21], [41]. However, most
of the existing context-aware monitoring solutions rely on
black-box data-driven models. Our goal is to combine expert
knowledge with learning from data to improve the monitors’
accuracy and transparency.
Recent systems-theoretic approaches to safety, such as the
Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP)
[42], propose hazard analysis methods for identifying unsafe
