User: I'm attempting to use GAE TaskQueue's REST API to pull tasks from a queue to an external server (a server not on GAE).

Is there a library that does this for me?
The API is simple enough, so I just need to figure out authentication. I examined the request sent by gtaskqueue_sample from google-api-python-client using --dump_request and found the authorization: OAuth XXX header. Adding that token to my own requested worked, but the token seems to expire periodically (possibly daily), and I can't figure out how to re-generate it. For that matter, gtaskqueue_sample itself no longer works (the call to https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token fails with No JSON object could be decoded).

How does one take care of authentication? This is a server app so ideally I could generate a token that I could use from then on.
Assistant: These APIS work only for GAE server since the queues can be created only via queue.yaml and infact API does not expose any API for inserting queue and tasks or project.
