User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Postfix - how to retry delivery of mail in queue? I have a backup mail server in case of a failure on the main one.
In that case of failure, mails come on the backup server and stay there until the main one is back.

If I wait some times, the delivery will be done automatically as soon as the main server is back but it can be long. So how to force a send retry of all the mails?

For exemple :
postqueue -p : give me a list of mails

I then tried postqueue -f (from man page : Flush the queue: attempt to deliver all queued mail.). It surely flushed the queue but mails were not been delivered...

Assistant: According to postqueue(1) you can simply run postqueue -f to flush your mail queue. If the mails aren't delivered after flushing the queue but are being requeued instead, you might want to check your mail logs for errors.

Taking a peek at postsuper(1) might also be helpful. Maybe the messages are on hold and need to be released first.
