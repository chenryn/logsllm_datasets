weather  data  on  the  globe  is  so  much  as  to  be  of  no  value  if  I 
cannot sort it to determine if there will be rain on my picnic. 
Now filtering requires more participants.  Increasingly filtering is 
used  to  select  distinct  information  for  individuals  rather  than 
trusted  selections  per  se.    Compare  the  selection  of  texts  for 
temple inclusion, to the library selection process, to the interactive 
selection  processes  of  Amazon.    In  the  previous  two  cases 
specialists make selections for a wide number of people based on 
professional training.  The relative value of the information they 
selected enabled the pre-press library to survive.  Depository laws, 
community  support  and  democratic  values  enabled  press-based 
libraries  to  survive.    What  is  the  value  of  filtering  and  what 
additional filtering models must be supported for the information 
economy  to  function in the digital networked age? And more to 
the  point,  how  do  current  DRM  technologies  enable  or  prevent 
the filtering and rating function? 
Currently  libraries  continue  to  receive  public  support  but  are 
overwhelmed  at  the  cost  and  difficulty  of  archiving  on-line 
material.  Archives (such as the WayBack machine) are prohibited 
from providing archival access by copyright – an essential feature 
of  the  analog  copyright  system.    In  addition,  individual  users 
develop following with web pages, blogs, personal selections, and 
electronic subscription or newsletter services with few avenues for 
archival storage.  Of these, arguably a blog is itself some sort of 
archive  given  the  temporal  ordering  of  items  of  interest  to  a 
selected community, although it is most compelling compared to 
the pre-museum curiosity collections. [34], [35]  
Thus  in  addition  to  the  reputation  market,  monetary  market, 
certainty of access/archiving, referencing systems, and binding of 
content to creators, the next copyright must function to allow the 
rewarding  of  filtering  or  to  explicitly  provide  support  for  a 
filtering market.  This is not a set of trivial design requirements.  
To  examine  the  state  thus  fare,  I  examine  four  digital  rights 
management systems. 
4.  COPYRIGHT TO “COPY ACCURATE”  
For three hundred years, dialogue thrived, the scientific revolution 
raged, and copyright established itself as the rational mechanism 
for  content  control  across  the  globe.    Vastly  different  cultures 
adopted copyright.  Over the last century new technologies, such 
as  the  phonograph,  radio,  motion  pictures,  and  even  high-speed 
presses,  have  monotonically  increased  the  expense  of  producing 
and  distributing 
fewer  publishers 
demanding  greater  copyright  protection.    Each  new  technology 
has  lead  to  new  variations  or  clarifications  in  copyright.    [14], 
[20], [26] 
Technological  change  resulting  in  changes  in  the  economics  of 
information has yielded changes in copyright.  Phonographs were 
the first challenge to the functionality of copyright.  When there 
was no medium for recording song or voice the author could be 
information, 
leading 
to 
assured  of  payment  when  the  music  was  reproduced  via  sheet 
music  sales.    Similarly  the  author  of  a  play  could  obtain 
reimbursement for small productions from the value of the scripts 
sold.  Yet the ability to record song or play changed that equation.  
When  the  movies  came  along  there  were  new  concerns  about 
ownership.    Both  those  who  rejoice  in  and  despair  of  digital 
networked  technology  identify  it  as  radical  and  as  ubiquitous  a 
change  as  networked  digital  information.    [18],  [36],  [37]    In 
short,  we  are  again  at  a  place  not  unlike  the  period  of 
discontinuity where copyright was created.  This discontinuity is 
so  great  as  to  require  more  than  a  clarification  of  copyright 
consistent with the technological (and legal) trajectory of the past 
century.   
I consider copyright as created at the discontinuity.  Essentially I 
seek a return to first principles to guide the design of digital rights 
management systems.   
The problems of authentication and document integrity studied by 
scholars  and  legislators  today  study  are  not  new,  but  ancient.  
Trustworthy  information  is  not  a  new  problem.    Reliability  of 
information,  currently  referred  to  as  integrity  in  computer 
security, has an ancient history.  In Babylon clay tablets were the 
mechanisms for recording information and contracts.  Where there 
was significant concern that one holder of the contract might alter 
the clay on which the details were impressed, four “copies” of a 
contract were made.  (While our concept of exact copies does not 
apply, the critical details were the same.) First two of the copies 
were baked.  Then these two copies were encased in the clay of 
the  other  copies  and  baked  inside,  illustrating  a  need  for  self-
validating contracts.  [25]  
It  is  because  of  the  importance  of  persistence,  integrity  and 
reputation that I call the functions the analogy for the paper-based 
copyright  system  for  networked  digital  copyright  be  “copy 
accurate”.  Copy accurate ideally would enable the same functions 
of  reference,  filtering,  persistence  and  surety  as  the  copyright 
system when grounded in the mass copying made possible by the 
press.    Copy  accurate  is  technology  grounded  in  the  mass 
publication made possible by the digital network.   
Practical  application  of  the  fundamental  practice  of  peer  review 
requires  multiple  copies  of  an  identical  document.    Yet  the 
printing press can only provide this function if there is an archive 
and  a  regulated  way  of  identifying  authorship,  as  well  as 
enforcement 
to  prevent  widespread  plagiarism.  
together  enable  referencing  and 
Copyright  and 
simplified the creation of communities of shared knowledge. [17]  
Because of the integrity of a paper document, when the Copyright 
Act created a market right, it created two market rights.  One right 
was the right to copy and resell the material; that is a physical or 
monetary  right.    The  other  right  was  the  technologically-given 
right to have ones name associated with the material, derived from 
the  right  of  authorship.    The  problem  of  illegal  copying  was 
distinct from the problem of usurpation even in the earliest days 
of  the  book.  [38]  This  continues  today,  as  illegal  copying  is 
distinguished from plagiarism.  (Should a student turn in a false 
paper  it  is  no  defense  to  say  that  a  fair  price  was  paid  for  the 
material.) 
Recall that paper, print and copyright in (1710) made it possible 
to  own  rights  to  expressions  of  information. 
  Ownership 
prohibited  plagiarism  from  any  work  by  extending  the  scope  of 
works  covered  to  all  ASCII  content.    Access,  persistence  and 
the  press 
functions 
82integrity  made  information  reliably  available  to  royalty  and 
scholars. 
In summary then, here are the functions of the copyright system as 
embedded  in  the  technology  of  the  printed  page.    Here  is  copy 
accuracy: 
1.  Market 
a.  Reputation 
b.  Monetary value

4.  A human right of expression 
5.  A moral right 
I  have  explicitly  chosen  not  treat  the  third  and  fourth  human 
rights  aspects.    It  is  my  contention  that  the  human  rights 
elements  do  not  provide  guidance 
the 
development of digital rights systems, especially since these two 
rights can be in conflict.  Kant created the concept of copyright 
as a human right in an essay on unlawful publishing in (1785) 
that  used  natural  law  to  argue  for  moral  ownership  for  the 
production of one’s mind.  [26] The argument for author’s right 
supposes  that  the  work  bears  “the  mark  of  the  author’s 
personality”.  Ownership of the fruit of intellectual labor is now 
widely  regarded  as  a  human  or  cultural  right.    Freedom  to 
access  information  and  privacy  rights  are  also  human  rights, 
confusing the matter further in the case of DRM.  [39] I include 
this to acknowledge the existence of these rights, and to identify 
that these do not make utilitarian design guidelines.  Given that 
the  elicitation  of  author’s  rights  followed  the  creation  of 
copyright  by  some  decades,  and  the  American  utilitarian 
insistence  on  rejecting  human  rights  notions  in  the  Berne 
Convention as late as 1956, this position is defensible as well as 
practical.   
Furthermore  my

technological and economic discontinuity, where the economics 
of  the  press  began  to  dominate  the  economics  of  information.  
Human rights based definitions of copyright, and the acceptance 
of those definitions, lagged the utilitarian functions.   
I therefore propose copy accuracy.

5.  DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE SYSTEMS  
Digital  rights  management  systems  attempt  to  implement  the 
copyright system in the digital realm.  Changes in the technology 
from  analog  to  digital  offer  users  some  new  options,  such  as 
creating back-ups, while potentially removing other, such as ease 
of archive, personal mark-up and integrity.  An implicit question 
answered by DRM design decisions is on what properties of paper 
are  valuable  enough  to  reproduce  in  DRM  and  which  can  be 
removed  or  made  subject  to  payment.    Those  implications  of 
design  decisions  are  made  explicit  for  three  designs  in  this 
section.   
In this section I describe three digital rights management systems: 
Giovanni,1, Content Scrambling System4, and the Adobe eBook2.  
Noticeably  this  requires  examining  DeCSS3  and  the  Advanced 
eBook Processor4.  In the use of the word secure, in no way do I 
intend  to  imply  that  all  the  systems  here  provide  cryptographic 
security, only that security is the design goal of the system.

identification, 
authentication  and  auditing  of  digital  audio  works.    Giovanni  is 
often  classed  as  mechanism  for  protecting  audio  content,  and 
indeed  there  is  a  company  focus  on  making  the  watermarking 
inaudible.  Yet Giovanni can be used for any content; and it is the 
explicit goal of Giovanni is to be available for all media. 
In the Blue Spike model a producer will create content and then 
mark it as his or her own.  This information will be presented for 
sale at the Blue Spike server.   
The  creator  or  owner  of  the  content  selects  attribute  data  to  be 
embedded  in  the  content.    The  resulting  secure  content  is  then 
stored and made available over Blue Spike’s servers.   
Giovanni  begins  by  generating  a  single  random  number  from 
Giovanni’s  key  and  the  seed  for  a  hash  function.    This  random 
number is divided into two segments, r0 and r1.  r0 is hashed with 
the attribution data to create a payload the correct size to data to 
embed,  thereby  creating  the  secure  content.    Then  r1  is  used  to 
determine  the  placement  in  the  content  of  watermarked  data 
generated with r0.  Thus the payload is encrypted and embedded 
into the content. 
Blue  Spike  has  a  model  that  requires  author  registration.    Blue 
Spike offers to manage the enforcement of the content as well, by 
searching for Giovanni signatures across the network. 
Blue Spike includes the option of embedding purchaser sensitive 
information in addition to producer information in a good.  It is 
not  exactly  clear  from  the  documentation  how  this  is  done, 
presumably the same symmetric keys are used and the purchaser 
information  is  added  to  the  hashed  payload.    In  the  case  of  the 
producers,  the  identifying  information  may  be  pseudonymous as 
long as the producer can prove him or herself the rightful owner.  
In the case of the customer the information is based on payment 
information  meaning  that  the  data  embedded  are  personally 
identifiable and therefore sensitive.
