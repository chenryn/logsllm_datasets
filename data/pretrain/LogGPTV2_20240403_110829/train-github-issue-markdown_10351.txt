#### Currently, pd.DataFrame does not have a `.nunique` method
`DataFrames` have various aggregation methods that they share with `series`,
examples being `.sum`, `.count` etc. Likewise with
`DataFrame.groupby`-objects.
In many cases, a `.nunique` would be useful as on `DataFrame` and
`DataFrame.groupby`-objects, for example when you're trying to assess the
diversity of data in a DataFrame.
#### Expected Output
When you're using `DataFrame.nunique`, with `n` columns, you should get back a
`series` where the index values are the dataframe.columns values, and the
series values are the count of unique values, for each column.
