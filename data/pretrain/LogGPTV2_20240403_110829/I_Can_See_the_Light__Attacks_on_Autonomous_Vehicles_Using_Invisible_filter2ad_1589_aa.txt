ABSTRACT
The camera is one of the most essential sensors for an autonomous
vehicle (AV) to perform Environment Perception and Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM). To secure the camera, current
autonomous vehicles not only utilize the data gathered from multi-
ple sensors for environment perception and SLAM but also require
the human driver to always realize the driving situation, which can
effectively defend against previous attack approaches (i.e., creat-
ing visible fake objects or introducing perturbations to the camera
by using advanced deep learning techniques). Different from their
work, in this paper, we in-depth investigate the features of Infrared
light and introduce a new security challenge called I-Can-See-the-
Light-Attack (ICSL Attack) that can alter environment perception
results and introduce SLAM errors to the AV. Specifically, we found
that the invisible infrared lights (IR light) can successfully trig-
ger the image sensor while human eyes cannot perceive IR lights.
Moreover, the IR light appears magenta color in the camera, which
triggers different pixels from the ambient visible light and can be
selected as key points during the AV‚Äôs SLAM process. By leveraging
these features, we explore to i) generate invisible traffic lights, ii)
create fake invisible objects, iii) ruin the in-car user experience, and
iv) introduce SLAM errors to the AV. We implement the ICSL Attack
by using off-the-shelf IR light sources and conduct an extensive
evaluation on Tesla Model 3 and an enterprise-level autonomous
driving platform under various environments and settings. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the ICSL Attack and prove that
current autonomous vehicle companies have not yet considered
the ICSL Attack, which introduces severe security issues. To secure
the AV, by exploring unique features of the IR light, we propose a
software-based detection module to defend against the ICSL Attack.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent autonomous vehicle (AV) developments have shown great
potential to improve driving quality and safety. With the support of
governments and private investments, the number of autonomous
vehicles on the road is estimated to reach 745,705 by the end of
2023 while the market size is projected to be valued at USD 24.73
Billion by 2027 [16, 17]. To enable self-driving, one of the most
fundamental components is environment perception, which utilizes
multiple sensors (e.g., Camera, Ultrasonic Sensor, Radar, or LiDAR)
to sense the environment. Then, based on the data gathered from
those sensors, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
process is conducted to make proper driving decisions. During
these procedures, the camera is one of the most important sensors
for the AV to understand its surroundings and current locations.
To avoid the severe consequences such as injuries or fatalities
generated by the camera malfunctions, prior studies have been
conducted to investigate the potential security risks of the camera.
For example, researchers have shown that the camera can be easily
blinded by the light with high intensities [57, 77]. Moreover, by
applying deep neural networks, ùëÖùëÉ2 is even able to create fake stop
sign to mislead the real road sign recognition system [38]. Built on
the top of ùëÖùëÉ2, the attacker can introduce physical adversarial per-
turbations to fool the image-based Faster R-CNN object detectors
[35]. However, these works either require the attacker to have ad-
vanced knowledge of the hardware or required advanced machine
learning techniques. To overcome these challenges, researchers
have demonstrated that an unskilled attacker can alter the percep-
tion results of the camera by creating fake traffic signs or objects
using a projector [52]. Recently, according to the requirements of
current autonomous vehicles, the human driver should be always
aware of the driving conditions and be prepared to take control of
the vehicle. Therefore, since the fake traffic signs or objects created
by these attack methods can be perceived by the human eyes, the
driver can easily detect the potential attacks and manually con-
trol the AV in this scenario. Despite the failure of the attack, the
successful detection of the attack may also result in reporting to
the police officers for further investigation, which will increase the
possibility of exposing the identity of the attacker.
In this paper, we propose the work that in-depth investigates
the possibility of attacking the camera using invisible lights. Specif-
ically, we found that human eyes cannot perceive the lights with

detection module to secure the autonomous vehicle. Specifically, it
is possible to implement IR filters on the camera to filter out the
IR lights. However, since there are more than 500, 000 autonomous
vehicles to be delivered each year and each vehicle has multiple
cameras [1], this hardware-based defense strategy will significantly
increase the cost for the autonomous vehicle company. On the other
hand, since the IR light appears the same as the visible magenta
color to the camera of an AV, it is difficult for the AV to distinguish
the IR lights from visible lights. To overcome this challenge, we
found that the IR light absorption rate is higher than visible light.
In other words, the camera cannot detect the reflections of IR lights
from other objects. By leveraging this unique feature, we propose a
simple and effective module to defend against the ICSL Attack. The
experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed module
(in section 6).
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
‚Ä¢ To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that in-depth
analyzes the effect of invisible IR light on the autonomous vehicle.
According to our analysis, we propose the I-Can-See-the-Light
Attack (ICSL Attack). We leverage the features of IR lights and
introduce related parameters and models to i) generate invisible
traffic signals, ii) create invisible objects, iii) ruin the in-car user
experience, and iv) introduce SLAM errors to the AV.
‚Ä¢ We conduct extensive real-world experiments by using a Tesla
Model 3 and an enterprise-level autonomous vehicle platform under
various scenarios and settings. The experiment results demonstrate
the harmful impacts of the ICSL Attack.
‚Ä¢ To defend against the ICSL Attack, we explore a unique feature
of IR lights and propose a novel software-based detection module
to secure the autonomous vehicle. The experiment results show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Environment Perception and SLAM in AV
Figure 2 shows a system architecture of an autonomous vehicle,
which consists of six parts: Environment Perception, Pre-processing,
Localization and Mapping, Sensor Fusion, Trajectory Prediction,
and Decision Making. The Environment Perception utilizes Camera,
Radar, Ultrasonic Sensor or USS, LiDAR, IMU, Wheel Speed Sensor,
and RTK GPS to sense the surroundings and understand the cur-
rent driving conditions (i.e., acceleration, orientation, and location,
etc). The data gathered from these sensors will be processed by
the Sensor Hub for synchronization and rectification, which will
then be categorized into different layers in the pre-processing step.
Meanwhile, the vision data from multiple cameras will be fused in
the localization and mapping step. To improve the environment
perception accuracy, the autonomous vehicle will perform sensor
fusion to better understand its surroundings. At last, in the trajec-
tory prediction and decision making steps, the fused data will be
used to predict objects‚Äô trajectories and the driving decisions are
made based on the prediction results.
As we can observe from this architecture, Environment percep-
tion and SLAM in the Localization and Mapping are two important
parts for the vehicle to perform autonomous driving. For the envi-
ronment perception, it is the ‚Äôeyes‚Äô for the autonomous vehicle to
understand its surroundings. For the SLAM, it is not only important

wavelengths larger than 740ùëõùëö while Infrared lights (IR lights) can
be detected by the cameras on the AV [9]. Moreover, the invisible
IR lights appear the magenta color in the camera, which is exactly
the same as the visible magenta light. In addition, since the IR light
triggers different pixels from the ambient lights in the camera, the
SLAM system in the autonomous vehicle tends to select the IR light
source as the key point for AV localization and mapping. Based
on these observations, we propose the I-Can-See-the-Light Attack
(ICSL Attack) by using IR lights. Different from simply blinding
the camera using visible lights [57, 77], we explore to leverage the
features of IR lights to i) generate invisible traffic signals, ii) create
fake invisible objects, iii) ruin the in-car user experience, and iv)
introduce SLAM errors to the autonomous vehicle. We believe that
by carefully selecting the attack scenarios and setting up the attack,
the AV can be attacked without the notice from the human driver.
To do this, we first analyze the architecture of the autonomous
vehicle. Then, we perform experiments to understand the features
of IR light and conduct a survey of human eyes to select the suit-
able IR lights to attack the autonomous vehicle (in section 2). By
leveraging the features of IR light, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of the ICSL Attack by altering the environment perception results
of a Tesla Model 3. A simple example is shown in Figure 1 (a), ICSL
Attack successfully generates an invisible red traffic light by using
IR light. Based on the experiment results, we also discuss the related
parameters that may affect the attack successful rate (in section
4.1.1). As shown in Figure 1 (b) and Figure 1 (c), to show severer se-
curity risks introduced by ICSL Attack, we continue to demonstrate
how attackers can utilize ICSL Attack to create invisible objects (in
section 4.1.2) and intentionally ruin the user experience (in section
4.2). To demonstrate the harmful impacts on the SLAM system of
an AV, we utilize an enterprise-level autonomous driving platform
to show the SLAM trajectories under ICSL Attack (in section 5.2),
which is shown in Figure 1 (d). At last, by analyzing the SLAM
errors, we propose a SLAM attack model to show how attackers
can control the SLAM trajectory of an AV by using the ICSL Attack.

for the AV to improve the environment perception accuracy and
eliminate AV‚Äôs blind spots but also essential for the AV to make
driving decisions. Specifically, since the GPS sensor only provides
a coarse location information in an outdoor scenario, it is insuffi-
cient for the AV to conduct navigation and perform self-driving.
To overcome this challenge, the vision data gathered from multiple
cameras is used to understand the location and build a local HD
map to make driving decisions. For example, in an indoor parking
lot, the GPS signal is weak. In this case, the AV analyzes each frame
that captured by the camera and extracts the corresponding key
points. Then, a matcher will be generated to find the same key
points on consecutive frames. According to the position changes
of the matched key points, the AV‚Äôs location and trajectory is cal-
culated. At last, the local HD map will be built according to the
trajectory of the AV. By using this approach, the AV can understand
its location and exit the parking lot according to the local map.
2.2 Basics of IR Light and Camera
Infrared light (IR light) is the electromagnetic radiation with wave-
lengths varies from 740ùëõùëö to 3 √ó 105ùëõùëö, which has been widely
used in industrial, scientific, military, commercial, and medical ap-
plications [4, 20]. For example, IR light can be utilized in security
cameras and Night-vision devices to capture nighttime images. To
do this, these devices need to detect the reflected lights from an
object by using IR light detectors. According to the requirements of
applications, the IR light detectors are made of different IR materi-
als, such as Calcium fluoride, fused silica and sodium chloride [14].
Normally, these materials should be carefully selected according to
their unique attributes in order to improve the IR light detection
