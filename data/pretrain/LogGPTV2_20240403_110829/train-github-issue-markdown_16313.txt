**Glen Mazza** opened **SPR-2177** and commented
The 2.0 Spring form:errors tag will expand an error message, if a validation
error is found in the command bean property, as follows:
 becomes:  
Password is missing
An "id" and a "name" attribute is added to the span, both with the same value
of "{commandbeanname}.errors".
Two suggestions:
1.) One problem with having an "id" attribute automatically added to the span
is that id's are supposed to be unique in an HTML document[1]. Although a rare
use case, one could duplicate the form:errors tag for the same command bean
property, with the result that the output HTML will have a duplicated ID.
Also, I'm unsure what additional benefits "id" buys the user that the already
present "name" does not, so removing "id" might make sense.
2.) It might be beneficial to add a class attribute with the same value to all
spans (regardless of property), perhaps called "formErrors". This will allow
one to conveniently use a CSS selector to specify that class value in order to
apply common formatting (such as red fonts) to **all** error messages:
    *.formErrors {
    	color: red
    }
