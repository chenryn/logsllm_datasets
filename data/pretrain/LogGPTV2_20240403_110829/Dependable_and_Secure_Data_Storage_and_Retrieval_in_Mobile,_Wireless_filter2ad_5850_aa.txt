Abstract.
This  paper  introduces  a  distributed  data  storage  for 
mobile,  wireless  networks  based  on  a  peer-to-peer 
paradigm.  The  distributed  storage  provides  support  to 
create  and  share  files  under  a  write-once  model,  and 
ensures  at  the  same  time  data  confidentiality  and 
dependability  by  encoding  files  in  a  Redundant  Residue 
Number  System.  More  specifically  files  are  partitioned 
into  records  and  each  record  in  encoded  separately  as 
(h+r)-tuples  of  data  residues  using  h+r  moduli.  In  turn, 
the  residues  are  distributed  among  the  mobiles  in  the 
network.  Dependability  is  ensured  since  data  can  be 
reconstructed  in  the  presence  of  up  to  s≤r  residue 
erasures, combined  with up to  (cid:172)
  corrupted residues, 
and  data  confidentiality  is  ensured  since  recovering  the 
original information requires knowledge of the entire set 
of moduli.

Introduction 
Mobile,  wireless  ad  hoc  networks  [1]  are  best  suited 
for application in environments where wired networks or 
base stations to support mobile terminals are unavailable 
or  unfeasible.  Examples  of  such  applications  are 
communication 
in  remote  or  hostile  environments, 
management  of  emergencies,  disaster  recovery,  and  ad-
hoc  commercial  installations.  Ad  hoc  networks  are 
generally an heterogeneous mix of different wireless and 
mobile  devices,  ranging  from  little  hand-held  devices  to 
laptops.  Such  devices  rely  on  on-board  batteries  for 
energy  supply,  hence  energy  efficiency  of  mobiles  is  an 
important  issue  [2].  The  effect  of  battery  depletion  is 
similar  to  a  crash  fault,  from  which  the  mobile  may  or 
may not recover depending  on  the availability of  battery 
replacement/recharge.  As  mobiles  may  not  be  equipped 
with permanent storage, failures may result in data losses 
or corruption.  
Ad hoc networks implement a distributed cooperation 
environment, based on a peer-to-peer paradigm. Given the 
limited range of wireless communication and mobility of 
nodes, the network connectivity  is variable and, to some 
extent,  unpredictable.  For 
this  reason  routing  and 
communication protocols are major issues [3-5]. 
Another major issue is how to implement dependable 
and  secure  data  storage  in  ad  hoc  networks.  This  is  an 
essential  requirement  in  applications  where  the  mobiles 
cooperate by sharing  information and need to create  and 
access shared files. The system should prevent data losses 
or  corruption  due  to  network  disconnections,  mobile 
failures or malicious attacks from untrustworthy mobiles. 
The file owners should prevent untrustworthy accesses to 
shared files by secure distribution of access privileges.  
The  above  issues  are  related  to  issues  addressed  in 
recent literature [6-13]. 
The  distributed  file systems Petal [6,7]  and  Coda [8] 
are based on the client-server paradigm where the servers

the  clients 
are  assumed  secure  and  trusted.  In  both  cases  data 
availability in ensured by replication, and Petal [6,7] uses 
encryption  to  provide  data  confidentiality.  In  Coda, 
mobility  of 
is  supported  by  allowing 
disconnected  mode  operations.  While  connected,  the 
clients generally operate in hoarding mode to upload the 
data necessary to work when disconnected. Extensions of 
Coda to cover weak connectivity (i.e. situations where the 
clients  have  a  slow,  although  almost  permanent, 
connection  to  the  servers)  have  been  proposed  in  [9].  If 
considered for application to mobile, ad hoc networks, the 
above  solutions  suffer  from  the  limitation  of  being 
conceived for a client server model, assuming secure and 
reliable servers. This model appears unsuitable to the peer 
to  peer  environment  of  ad  hoc  networks.  Furthermore, 
Coda  disregards  the  issue  of  data  confidentiality,  and 
memory  and  bandwidth  requirements  of  hoarding  can 
hardly  be  met  in  the  prospected  scenario  of  ad  hoc 
networks.  A  serverless  file  system  has  been  proposed  in 
[10]; however it is conceived for systems connected with 
fast,  wired  networks,  where  mobility  and  disconnections 
of nodes is not supported. 
A  nice  technique  for  fault-tolerant  file  server  (IDA) 
based  on  a  peer  to  peer  paradigm  has  been  proposed  in 
[11]. IDA fragments files and disperse fragments by using 
erasure codes, thus achieving reliability in storage and/or 
data transmission. However confidentiality issues are not 
addressed. 
in 
[12,13] 
The  above  approaches 
focus  mainly  on  data 
availability  but  disregard  aspects  related  to  intrusion 
tolerance,  which  are  deeply  investigated  in  [12,13].  The 
scheme  proposed 
relies  on  distributed 
authentication/authorization  servers  exploiting  majority 
voting  to  grant  access  to  the  users.  The  authors  use 
cryptography  and  data  fragmentation  and  replication  in 
the distributed file server to enforce data availability and 
confidentiality.  This  scheme,  which  has  been  conceived 
for  wired  networks,  pays  considerable  communication 
overhead  to  implement  user  authentication  and  data 
fragmentation.  This  overhead  may  not  be  tolerable  in 
wireless  ad  hoc  networks  where  the  communication  and 
computation resources are relatively scarce. 
An extensive survey on intrusion-tolerant systems can 
be found in [14]. 
The  issue  of  dependable  distributed  storage  has  also 
been addressed in the area of digital libraries. In [15,16] a 
distributed archival intermemory is proposed as a mean to 
distribute large data sets among a large number of servers. 
This system partitions the data set among the servers and 
exploits  erasure  codes  [17]  to  encode  the  data.  The 
erasure codes under consideration are systematic and have 
the  property 
the  original  data  can  still  be 
reconstructed  if  part  of  the  encoded  data  is  unavailable 
(for  example  due 
to  server  crashes  or  network 
disconnections).  However  these  codes  appear  unsuitable 
that 
to provide data confidentiality and do not protect against 
corruptions  caused, for example, by malicious servers or 
nodes  in  the  data  transmission  paths.  These  issues  are 
solved 
in  [18],  assuming  untrusted  communication 
infrastructure and trusted and secure storage servers. This 
system  uses  erasure  codes  for  dependability  and  data 
encryption to enforce confidentiality. 
With different aims, erasure codes provide a mean to 
speed up downloads in internet applications [19]. Here a 
file  consisting  of  h  data  packets  is  encoded  into  h+r
packets  using  an  erasure  code,  and  the  h+r  packets  are 
distributed  to  mirror  sites.  Since  erasure  codes  allow 
decoding  of  encoded  data  in  presence  of  at  least  h
packets, file readout is completed as soon as h packets are 
read from the h fastest mirrors. 
In this paper we reconsider the approach of [11] using 
a Redundant  Residue  Number  System  (RRNS)  [20]  to 
encode data. As compared to [11], the encoding based on 
RRNS  allows  uniform  coverage  of  both  erasures  and 
errors. The objective is to provide dependable storage to 
the users of mobile wireless networks, which also features 
basic 
and 
confidentiality  are  inherently  provided  by  the  RRNS
encoding.  It  appears  that  this  encoding  may  be  further 
exploited  to  construct  sophisticated  intrusion  tolerant 
environments, comparable to the one described in [12,13]. 
This matter is the subject of ongoing studies.

security  is  ensured  since  mobiles  having  access  to  the 
residues  are  able to  decode  them  only  if  they  also  know 
the entire set of moduli. The parameters h and r can be set 
by  the  user.  Similarly  to  the  approach  of  [19],  RRNS-
based encoding can be also used to speed up data access.

2.  System Model 
We  consider  a  set  of  n  mobile  hosts  (also  called 
mobiles)  each  assigned  with  a  unique  identifier,  ranging 
from  0  to  n–1.  Hereafter,  the  concise  notation  ui  will 
sometimes  be  used  to  denote  the  mobile  i.  The  mobiles 
communicate  with  each  other  via  radio  transceivers  and 
they  use  a  MAC  protocol  to  solve  contentions  over  the

wireless channel. In general the network is multi-hop, that 
is,  when  mobiles  communicate  with  destinations  which 
are located outside of their transmission ranges or hidden 
by obstacles, they rely on other mobiles which cooperate 
to forward messages to their destinations. We assume that 
the network layer provides the upper software levels with 
services  of  message delivery  by  running  suitable  routing 
algorithms.  However,  mobiles 
failures  or  network 
disconnections may impair service  dependability, that is, 
messages may fail to reach their destination.  
Due to mobility of nodes, the network topology varies 
with time. At a given instant of time it is described by the 
graph G(V,E), where link (ui,uj)∈E iff ui and uj are in the 
range  of  each  other  and  a  direct 
transmission 
communication  between 
is  not  prevented  by 
obstacles  (ui  and  uj  are  adjacent).  It  should  be  observed 
that,  depending  on  the  position  of  the  mobiles,  on  their 
transmission  range  and  on  the  presence  of  obstacles, 
graph G may be temporarily disconnected, i.e. groups of 
mobiles may be unreachable to each other. An example of 
ad hoc network and the corresponding graph G is shown 
in Figure 1. 
them 
During  the  network  lifetime,  mobiles  may  fail  and 
possibly resume operation after a while. Mobiles may fail 
for  several  reason,  for  example  because  of  hardware 
faults, system crashes or battery depletion. If the fault is 
not  permanent,  the  mobile  may  connect  again  to  the 
network  after  a  while,  but  still  the  failure  may  have 
produced  data  losses  or  corruption.  Due  to  mobility,  a 
mobile  may  remain  disconnected  from  the  network  for 
arbitrarily  long  periods,  during  which,  from  the  point  of 
view  of  the  other  mobiles,  it  behaves  as  faulty  at  any 
effect. 
in 
As  mobiles  in  the  network  cooperate  by  sharing 
information, information dependability and security must 
be  enforced.  Let  us  consider  a  mobile  i  owning  a 
confidential data d, which should be shared by some other 
mobile. A solution in which i is the only place to store d
should  be  discarded  as 
it  does  neither  provide 
dependability  nor  availability.  In  fact,  failures  of  i  may 
result 
losses  or  damages  of  d,  and  network 
disconnections may prevent any j≠i from accessing d for

to  ensure  data 
dependability  and  availability,  the  storage  must  be 
distributed and redundant. However distributed storage in 
ad  hoc  network  environments  introduce issues  related to 
data  security  and  confidentiality.  In  fact  data  transferred 
by  multi-hop  protocols  may  easily  be  intercepted  and/or 
altered.  For  this  reason  the  distributed  data  storage  must 
be at the same time dependable and secure.
