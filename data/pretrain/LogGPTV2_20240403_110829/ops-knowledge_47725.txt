**Issue: Running a Python Script on a Windows Server Without Python Installed**

I have a simple Python script that needs to run on a Windows Server where Python is not installed. To address this, I used `py2exe` to generate an executable file. The `py2exe` process successfully created a `dist` subdirectory containing `script.exe`, which runs without issues on my local machine.

However, when I attempt to run `script.exe` on the target server (Windows Server 2003 R2), I encounter the following error message:
```
The system cannot execute the specified program.
```
Additionally, the `ERRORLEVEL` is reported as 9020.

**Resolution:**
I was unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue. However, I discovered that using Python 2.5 with `py2exe` to compile the same script resolved the problem, and the generated executable ran successfully on the server. This suggests that there may be a compatibility issue or bug in `py2exe` when used with Python 2.6.

If you encounter a similar issue, consider downgrading to Python 2.5 for the `py2exe` compilation process.
