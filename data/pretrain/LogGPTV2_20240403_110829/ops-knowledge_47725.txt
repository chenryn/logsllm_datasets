User: A simple python script needs to run on a windows server with no python installed.
I used py2exe, which generated a healthy dist subdirectory, with script.exe that runs fine on the local machine.
However, when I run it on the server (Windows Server 2003 R2), it produces this:
The system cannot execute the specified program. 
and ERRORLEVEL is 9020.
Any ideas?
Assistant: I did not find the cause to the problem, but using python 2.5 with py2exe on the same script worked fine on the server.  
I guess there is something wrong with py2exe under 2.6.
