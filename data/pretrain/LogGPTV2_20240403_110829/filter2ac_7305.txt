**Title: Booting the iOS Kernel to an Interactive Bash Shell on QEMU**

**Abstract:**
This presentation will showcase the successful booting of the iOS kernel on QEMU, complete with an interactive Bash shell and a live debugger attached to the kernel. This achievement represents a significant step toward developing a fully open-source iOS system emulator in QEMU. The talk will cover the research details and provide a live demonstration of the setup.
