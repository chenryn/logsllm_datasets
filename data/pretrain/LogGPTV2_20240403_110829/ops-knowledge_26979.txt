User: What are the benefits of using container technology to develop and deploy applications? Please list at least three.
Assistant: 1. Resource isolation: The use of container technology can isolate applications from the underlying system, avoiding problems caused by resource contention at the system level, such as conflicts between applications, resource contention, and crashes, etc., thereby improving the performance of applications. stability and reliability. 2. Rapid deployment: Container technology can easily start and stop container images within seconds, quickly deploy and expand applications, and is faster and more efficient than traditional virtual machine technology. 3. Saving resources: Container technology can use lightweight isolation technology to achieve fast startup and efficient operation, reducing the resource occupation of physical machines, enabling fewer hardware resources to support more applications, and effectively Use existing resources to maximize resource utilization.
