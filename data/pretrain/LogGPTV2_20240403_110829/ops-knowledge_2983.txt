Which of the following best describes the approach the developer should take to fulfill these requirements?"
 "A": "Implement an IntentService, as it creates a new thread that can handle IPC and can be bound by other services."
 "B": "Use a local broadcast manager to create a bound service that ensures private data does not leave the application's perimeter."
 "C": "Create a bound service using an IBinder interface and manage its lifecycle to handle long-term operations."
 "D": "Set up a BroadcastReceiver declared in the Android Manifest file to receive and handle IPC and bind with other applications."
Answer: C
