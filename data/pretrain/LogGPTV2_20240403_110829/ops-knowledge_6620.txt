User: After forced restart due to frozen laptop (windows 7 pro, 32 bit) Eclipse is providing the following message:

It seems that the Python interpreter is not currently configured.
How do you want to proceed?"

Clicking the Auto config option and then ok I get the Python Interpreters window with the right name (Python), Location (c:\Program Files\Python27\python.exe) and system libs.
It all looks ok but clicking OK or Apply doesn't seem to do anything and the whole thing starts from the beginning (the message about Python not currently configured...).
I've checked my .pydevproject permissions and I have full control over the file.
I also have dropbox sync-ing the project files but it has been ok for a while now.
What is wrong, what should I check/do?
Assistant: Don't know if it is global or local (project-related).

Globally you can set the interpreter via the path Window-Menu → Preferences → PyDev → Interpreter - Python.
Project-related this can be done via right-click on project → Properties → PyDev - Interpreter/Grammar.

Have a look at both and make sure that both are set to correct values.
