### Affected Version
0.22.2
### Description
Starting up a broker with HTTP typed serverview has been resulting with
multiple HttpServerInventoryView objects being created. This would seem to
create a bunch of duplicate data on heap + a bunch of duplicate HTTP requests
to data servers

Upon further investigation it appears this only happens when Druid SQL is
enabled on the broker.
