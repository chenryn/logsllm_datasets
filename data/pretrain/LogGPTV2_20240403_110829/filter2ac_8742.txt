### Title: Sleight of ARM: Demystifying Intel Houdini

ARM architecture is rapidly gaining prominence in the computer industry. In recent years, several key players have transitioned from x86-based processors to ARM processors. Apple's shift from x86 to ARM, facilitated by the binary translator Rosetta 2, has garnered significant attention from researchers and reverse engineers. However, less known is Intel's own binary translator, Houdini, which enables the execution of ARM binaries on x8ltric platforms.

In this presentation, we will delve into Intel's proprietary Houdini translator, which is primarily used by Android on x86 platforms, such as high-end Chromebooks and desktop Android emulators. We will begin with a high-level overview of how Houdini operates and how it is integrated into processes. Next, we will explore the low-level internals of the Houdini engine and its memory model, highlighting several security vulnerabilities that it introduces into the processes that use it. Finally, we will discuss methods for escaping the Houdini environment, executing arbitrary ARM and x86 code, and developing Houdini-targeted malware that can evade existing platform analysis.
