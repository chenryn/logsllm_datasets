## Abstract
With the rise of Real-Time Bidding (RTB) in programmatic advertising, click farms that use large numbers of real smartphones to conduct ad fraud have become a significant threat. This study presents an initial step towards detecting and measuring click farm-based invalid traffic. We begin by analyzing device features using a real-world labeled dataset, which reveals key characteristics distinguishing fraudulent from benign devices. Based on these features, we develop EH, a system for detecting fraudulent devices through ad bid request logs. EH operates by:
1. Building a classifier to distinguish fraudulent and benign devices.
2. Clustering devices based on app usage patterns.
3. Relabeling devices in clusters through majority voting.

EH achieves 97% precision and 95% recall on a real-world labeled dataset. By investigating a large-scale click farm, we uncover common cheating strategies used by fraudulent clusters. We also optimize EH to reduce overhead and discuss its deployment in a real-world system. Our work is in collaboration with a leading ad verification company to integrate EH into their industrial platform.

## 1 Introduction
Programmatic advertising has driven the growth of internet advertising over the past decades, thanks to innovations like Real-Time Bidding (RTB). RTB provides a digital marketplace where website owners and mobile app developers can sell ad slots to advertisers through real-time auctions. The global RTB market size is projected to grow from $6.6 billion USD in 2019 to $27.2 billion USD by 2024 [33]. However, this growth has attracted fraudulent ad slot sellers who fabricate ad requests, often outsourced to click farms. These farms control thousands of mobile devices or emulators to mimic normal app usage, tricking advertisers into believing their ads are seen by actual users. 

The Cost Per Mille (CPM) pricing model means that fraudsters no longer need to click on ads, making detection more challenging. Prior works focusing on click spam or authenticated clicks are not applicable in the RTB era. Industry efforts to combat invalid traffic rely heavily on rule-based detection methods such as blacklists and metadata checks, but little attention has been paid to large-scale click farms.

### Challenges
- **Mimicry:** Attackers use various hardware and software strategies to mimic human behavior, making it difficult to detect.
- **Noisy Data:** Noisy ad traffic data and dynamic network environments make detection based on individual devices less reliable.
- **Scalability:** Processing billions of transactions daily requires a practical detection system with low overhead.

### EH System
We present EH, the first system to investigate click farm-oriented invalid traffic detection using real-world mobile RTB transaction data. EH detects fraudulent devices by:
1. **Classification:** Building a classifier to flag individual devices.
2. **Clustering:** Capturing cluster-level features using a Top-App based Clustering Algorithm.
3. **Relabeling:** Aggregating information and performing majority voting to detect click farms and fraudulent devices.

Our evaluation shows that EH can accurately detect real-world click farms with moderate overhead. We also reveal interesting findings about detected click farms, which we have reported to a leading ad verification company. Based on our study, we have contributed a fraud reason code for click farm detection in their real-world system.

### Contributions
- **New Features (Section 4):** Revealing important characteristics of fraudulent devices.
- **New System (Section 5):** Proposing EH, a three-stage fraud detection system.
- **New Findings (Section 7):** Identifying strategies used by large-scale click farms to evade detection.
- **Optimization and Deployment (Section 8):** Reducing EH's overhead and integrating it into a real-world system.

### Ethical Considerations
Data is collected with user consent and kept in the ad traffic verification company's data center, accessible only to the authors' affiliation. We have obtained approval for accessing the ad bid logs, and the data does not include Personal Identifiable Information (PII).

## 2 Background
### Ecosystem of Programmatic Advertising
Digital advertising is processed through programmatic platforms involving Advertisers, Publishers, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), Supply Side Platforms (SSPs), and Ad-Exchanges. Publishers auction ad slots via SSPs, and Advertisers bid on these slots through DSPs. Ad-Exchanges facilitate these auctions, typically occurring billions of times per day.

### Ad Fraud
Tech-savvy fraudulent publishers generate fake traffic and fraudulent ad inventories to trick advertisers. Invalid Traffic (IVT) can be caused by known invalid data-center traffic, bots, and other automated systems. Advanced techniques are required to detect IVT generated by custom automation software, infected devices, and incentivized human activities.

### Ad Traffic Validation
The industry relies on third-party ad traffic verification services to identify and filter IVT. To enhance robustness, different measurement organizations compare and cross-check IVT results. For example, the Distributed Invalid Traffic Filter (DIF) project allows different validators to upload IVT measurements and vote on suspicious devices or IPs.

## 3 Datasets
### Format of Ad Bid Logs
Our datasets contain ad bid logs from industrial collaborators, recording ad bid requests in ad exchange platforms. A typical ad bid request includes fields such as IP address, Ad Slot ID, Device IDs (IMEI, Android ID, IDFA), OS, Location, and Timestamp (see Table 1).

| Field          | Description                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| IP             | IP address of the device          |
| Ad Slot ID     | Unique identifier of the ad slot   |
| IMEI           | International Mobile Equipment Identity |
| Android ID     | Unique identifier for Android devices |
| IDFA           | Identifier for Advertisers (iOS)    |
| OS             | Operating system                   |
| Location       | Current location of the device     |
| Timestamp      | Time of the ad request             |

These datasets form the basis for the design and evaluation of EH.
