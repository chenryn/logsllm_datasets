Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-create-bootstrap-
wells has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include links to
screenshots if possible.
Please note that the classes described in the first checkpoint are mixed up.
The
's with class "well" should go within the
's with class "col-xs-6", instead of the other way around. Thank you!
Repro steps:  
Go to http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-create-bootstrap-wells  
and observe the first checkpoint on the left.
