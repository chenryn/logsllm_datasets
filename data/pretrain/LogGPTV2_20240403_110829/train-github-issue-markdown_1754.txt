I'm trying to create a panel with three tabs.  
I have a strange problem, if I add the "col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6"
classes the panel background won't match the form height,

while it's perfectly fine if I remove the responsive classes

I've checked the html and apparently it's all good, I wouldn't like to force a
min-height on these panels, do you have any idea how to fix this? (I've also
tried to assign a background and removing the alert alert-info from the tab-
pane, but it won't grow anyway.
