User: I setup a job on google cloud dataflow, and it need more than 7 hours to make it done. My Job ID is 2016-10-10_09_29_48-13166717443134662621. It didn't show any error in pipeline. Just keep logging out "oauth2client.transport : Refreshing due to a 401". Is there any problem of my workers or there is something wrong. If so, how can I solve it?
Assistant: As a general approach, you should try running the pipeline locally, using the DirectPipelineRunner on a small dataset to debug your custom transformations.
Once that passes, you can use the Google Cloud Dataflow UI to investigate the pipeline state. You can particularly look at Elements Added field in the Step tab to see whether your transformations are producing output.

In this particular job, there's a step that doesn't seem to be producing output, which normally indicates an issue in the user code.
