Latency (days)
Fig. 3. CDFs of latency for preﬁxes where BGP data existed. Left graph represents the 52% of
preﬁxes that were never announced. Right graph represents the 36% that were announced. The
remaining 12% were allocated before our BGP data begins.
However, address allocations do not imply address usage. Is this allocation really a
good measure of IPv6 deployment?
2.4 Preﬁxes Are Allocated, But Often Not Used
We turn to BGP routing data, which documents which IPv6 addresses are currently
routable on the IPv6 Internet. Figure 3 shows how long it takes institutions to announce
their address blocks (or any sub-block) after they’ve been allocated. We call this “usage
latency,” and is deﬁned as the difference in time between allocation and the preﬁx’s ﬁrst
appearance in the BGP routing tables.
There are a few points of note about Figure 3. 52% of all allocated preﬁxes never
appear. Measuring latency for these preﬁxes is impossible, since it is unknown when
they will be used (if ever). Instead, we measure minimum latency, i.e., the minimum
amount of time before usage. We ﬁnd that the average minimum latency is 957 days
(which is an underestimate for the true latency!). The kink in the curve corresponds
to the policy changes of APNIC and RIPENCC in July of 2002, as mentioned earlier;
many addresses allocated during that surge were never used.
When computing true latency for the remaining preﬁxes, we run across a snag. Ap-
proximately 12% of all preﬁxes were allocated before 2003, when our BGP data begins.
As such, it is impossible to accurately measure latency for these preﬁxes. We ignore
such preﬁxes since they are a small minority.
For the remaining 36% of preﬁxes, latency averages 173 days. For comparison, we
look to a study concerning usage latency in IPv4 in 2005 [10]. The study found that
87% of all preﬁxes were eventually announced in BGP, and the average latency for these
preﬁxes was 52 days. Thus, there are fewer IPv6 users than their IPv4 counterpart, and
they are also much slower to deploy.
Overall, there was some slight variation in latency between regions, but all regions
were within a factor of 1.5 of each other. RIPE averaged 141 day latency. LACNIC’s
latency was 159 days, and AFRINIC’s was 177 days. APNIC and ARIN were nearly
identical, at 202 and 211 days, respectively.

3 Trafﬁc Analysis in a US Tier-1 ISP
While the RIR and BGP data capture the rate of IPv6 adoption, this ignores three other
aspects of IPv6 deployment – how people are transitioning their IPv4 networks to IPv6,
how IPv6 addresses are actually assigned to individual machines, and what IPv6 appli-
cations are being used. Identifying transitional technologies helps us understand how
IPv4 networks connect to the IPv6 world; The upper 64-bits of an IPv6 address identify
such mechanisms, as they each have different IP ranges. Observing addresses tells us
how organizations assign IPv6 addresses to individual interfaces. Since the low order
64 bits are reserved entirely for host machines, we can use this to see how individ-
ual organizations number their devices. Third, to analyze the application mix, we look
at the signature (source port, destination port, protocol) to map it to an application
name.
3.1 Data Sources
To analyze native IPv6 trafﬁc, we use Netﬂow records collected from an IPv6 Internet
gateway router in a US tier-1 ISP with 11 IPv6 BGP neighbors. These records were
collected from 2008-4-1 to 2008-9-26, and are taken from the business customers. To
analyze tunneled trafﬁc, we collected packet header traces from 2008-7-02 to 2008-8-
31 at an access router servicing approximately 20,000 DSL subscribers (different from
the business customers) in an ISP. In particular, we analyzed the IPv6 headers within
Teredo tunnels. Teredo [11] is an IPv6 tunneling technology created by Microsoft to
enable IPv6 communications for Windows users. Due to the prevalence of Windows
among typical Internet users, we assume that most tunneled IPv6 trafﬁc destined for
these subscribers use Teredo.
Unfortunately, our records are not perfect, and have some holes. Note that 5th, 6th,
9th, 10th, and 11th of July are not analyzed for Netﬂow. Also note that for the tunneled
trafﬁc, data from 2008-7-10 to 2008-7-21, along with 2008-8-19, 2008-8-23, and 2008-
8-26 are not included.
3.2 Identifying Transitional Technologies and Address Enumeration
We identify transitional technologies as follows. Teredo uses 2001:0000: for the ﬁrst
32 bits [11] of an IPv6 address, making it easily identiﬁable. 6to4, another popular en-
capsulating scheme, begin with 2002:. Although other transitional schemes exist and
can be identiﬁed (e.g., ISATAP, automatic tunnels, etc.), they are quite rare in practice;
as such, we lump them together as under the label “other”.
To discover how organizations assign addresses to devices, we use the same method-
ology as presented in [12]. The types of enumeration are: Teredo (Teredo encodes op-
tions and routing information in the lower 64-bits), MAC address based (also called
auto-conﬁguration), low (only using the last 12 bits), wordy (using words that can be
spelled in hexadecimal, like BEEF), privacy (all bits are randomly set, according to the
IPv6 privacy speciﬁcation [13]), v4 based (when a corresponding IPv4 address inﬂu-
ences the choice of host address), and unidentiﬁed (for all others).

3.3 Transitional Technologies
The results of analyzing the IP address structure are presented in Table 2. Most of the
native IPv6 addresses of the tier-1 ISP tended to communicate with other native IPv6
addresses; approximately 80% of addresses fell into this category. 6to4 addresses were
also signiﬁcant, representing approximately 18% of addresses seen. Teredo addresses
constituted approximately 2%, and the remaining technologies were almost negligible.
These results also match those found for an analysis done in 2007 [12]. As an important
note, the data sets used in our analysis are quite different from those in [12] (which
included web server trafﬁc, name server trafﬁc, and traceroutes). Since we have a dif-
ferent vantage point and a different time-frame, yet have the same results, we believe
that the technologies used by organizations remain unchanged for the past year.
From the tunneled perspective, we see that Teredo and native addresses are popular.
Moreover, around 2008-8, a surge of Teredo-to-Teredo connections is seen.
3.4 Assigning Addresses to Machines
In addition to looking at transitional technologies, we looked at the breakdown of IPv6
address assignment schemes. Table 3 demonstrates the ratios of various host conﬁg-
urations. A few interesting trends emerge. First, IPv4 based addresses decline sharply
(although there is a spike in August that remains unexplained). Moreover, privacy exten-
sions remain relatively unused, occupying a small percentage of all addresses (possibly
because some operating systems do not enable privacy extensions by default).

3.5 Application Mix
Looking at the application breakdown yielded interesting results, as seen in Table 4.
Expected trafﬁc, like web and mail, was surprisingly low – usually between 1% to
8% for web and 1% and 2% for mail. We performed DNS reverse lookups on the few
IPv6 addresses that used web protocols and found that popular sites include an IPv6
deployment and tunnel broker and a backbone network for universities. On average,
about 85% of trafﬁc is DNS queries and 8% ICMP messages. Overall, these results are
quite surprising. We believe there are two possible reasons. One could be that people
are mainly using probing applications over their IPv6 networks, and not actual appli-
cations. Another is that operating systems like Windows Vista will send an extra DNS
request when IPv6 capabilities are turned on: one requesting the IPv4 address and one
requesting the IPv6 address [14]. Thus, the IPv6 interface may send and receive DNS
queries but not trafﬁc. Despite the potential inﬂation of DNS records in our data, there
is still very little “real” trafﬁc seen for IPv6. We believe that this demonstrates, for at
least this tier-1 ISP, customers view IPv6 as experimental.

For Teredo tunneled trafﬁc, application breakdown was also interesting. Table 4
shows that almost all trafﬁc is unidentiﬁable UDP or TCP, indicating random port num-
bers. Given the vast quantity of unidentiﬁable trafﬁc, and the rise of Teredo pairs, it
is likely that these are P2P applications communicating with each other (as random
port numbers are characteristic of P2P trafﬁc). Indeed, some applications have turned
to Teredo to solve the issue faced by end hosts that are limited by their NAT/ﬁrewall
technologies when they try to initiate communications with each other; using the Teredo
protocol, a client contacts a Teredo server, which acts as a broker agent between Teredo
clients, aiding in NAT/ﬁrewall hole punching, as well as providing unique IPv6 ad-
dresses. Several P2P clients have implemented IPv6 support [15], such as uTorrent and
Vuze (formerly Azureus); moreover, uTorrent has the ability to set up Teredo auto-
matically [16]. To summarize, it appears as if considerable tunneled IPv6 trafﬁc is a
by-product of applications (such as P2P ﬁle-sharing) using Teredo as a mechanism to
bypass local NATs and ﬁrewalls, simplifying the application developers’ jobs.
4 Related Work
IPv6 topology has been investigated by CAIDA’s scamper work [17], as well Hoerdt
and Magoni’s Network Cartographer [18]. Because we did not investigate this aspect of
IPv6 deployment, we consider our work to be complementary to these studies.
Quantifying the Extent of IPv6 Deployment
21
Anomalous BGP behavior has been analyzed through Huston’s automatically gen-
erated IPv6 reports [19]. These reports include information about routing instability,
preﬁx aggregation, table sizes, and allocation sizes.
Testing the readiness of IPv6-enabled software occurred in February of 2008, when
NANOG shut off IPv4 access from their meeting for one hour [20]. It resulted in a se-
vere restriction of services, with end users often needing to re-conﬁgure their machines.
It revealed that IPv6-enabling software is still somewhat user unfriendly [21]. We be-
lieve this work on how an individual can use IPv6 to be complementary to our work on
how organizations are using IPv6.
Regarding trafﬁc analysis, Arbor Networks [22] found that IPv6 trafﬁc is growing at
the same rate as IPv4 trafﬁc. Savola [23] analyzed 6to4 trafﬁc and found much was ex-
perimental, and also noted a rise in P2P applications. Hei and Yamazaki [24] analyzed
6to4 trafﬁc on a relay in Japan and found that TCP trafﬁc dominated UDP, with a con-
siderable amount of HTTP trafﬁc (40% of total). Our work complements these studies
because we analyze different data sources, and offer a new perspective by analyzing
trafﬁc from a tier-1 ISP.
Finally, David Malone’s work on IPv6 addresses analyzed transitional technologies
and the assignment of IPv6 addresses to machines [12]. He looked at the breakdown
of types of IPv6 addresses (Teredo, 6to4, etc.), as well as the classiﬁcation of the host
part of IPv6 addresses. While we do repeat some of the same analysis (and use some of
the same techniques), we believe there are key differences between our study and his.
We cover broader ground by looking at more data sources: RIR allocations, BGP data,
Netﬂow records, and packet header traces. We also perform additional analysis, such as
address space allocation and latency.
5 Conclusion
While IPv6 is beginning to see larger deployments, it still has some signiﬁcant barriers
to overcome. IPv6 is still viewed as experimental by some, and often is deployed in
counter-intuitive ways. By analyzing RIR and BGP data, it appears that many alloca-
tions are speculatory, and that autonomous systems wait signiﬁcant amounts of time
before actual announcement. Moreover, although IPv6 trafﬁc is growing, our data from
a US tier-1 ISP indicated that much of it is still DNS and ICMP packets, indicating
a lack of true IPv6 applications from our vantage point; additionally, tunneled trafﬁc
analysis shows much of the communication is between IPv4 pairs, implying that appli-
cations like P2P ﬁle sharing are dominant.
Further work would include a longer study of these characteristics, as well as a topo-
logical study involving more end hosts. Moreover, it would be interesting to track op-
erating system developments and their support for various transitional schemes, as well
as native support, to better understand how this software shapes the future of IPv6.
