### 3. Traffic Analysis in a US Tier-1 ISP

While the RIR and BGP data capture the rate of IPv6 adoption, they do not address three other critical aspects of IPv6 deployment: how organizations transition their IPv4 networks to IPv6, how IPv6 addresses are assigned to individual devices, and what IPv6 applications are being used. Understanding transitional technologies helps us comprehend how IPv4 networks connect to the IPv6 world; the upper 64 bits of an IPv6 address identify such mechanisms, as each has different IP ranges. Observing address assignments tells us how organizations allocate IPv6 addresses to individual interfaces. Since the lower 64 bits are reserved for host machines, we can use this to see how organizations number their devices. Finally, to analyze the application mix, we examine the signature (source port, destination port, protocol) to map it to an application name.

#### 3.1 Data Sources

To analyze native IPv6 traffic, we used NetFlow records collected from an IPv6 Internet gateway router in a US tier-1 ISP with 11 IPv6 BGP neighbors. These records were collected from April 1, 2008, to September 26, 2008, and are taken from business customers. To analyze tunneled traffic, we collected packet header traces from July 2, 2008, to August 31, 2008, at an access router servicing approximately 20,000 DSL subscribers (different from the business customers) in an ISP. Specifically, we analyzed the IPv6 headers within Teredo tunnels. Teredo, created by Microsoft, is an IPv6 tunneling technology that enables IPv6 communications for Windows users. Given the prevalence of Windows among typical Internet users, we assume that most tunneled IPv6 traffic destined for these subscribers uses Teredo.

Unfortunately, our records have some gaps. Note that the NetFlow data for July 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11, 2008, are missing. Additionally, for the tunneled traffic, data from July 10 to July 21, 2008, and August 19, 23, and 26, 2008, are not included.

#### 3.2 Identifying Transitional Technologies and Address Enumeration

We identified transitional technologies as follows: Teredo uses `2001:0000:` for the first 32 bits of an IPv6 address, making it easily identifiable. 6to4, another popular encapsulating scheme, begins with `2002:`. Although other transitional schemes exist and can be identified (e.g., ISATAP, automatic tunnels, etc.), they are quite rare in practice. Therefore, we group them under the label "other."

To discover how organizations assign addresses to devices, we used the same methodology as presented in [12]. The types of enumeration include:
- **Teredo**: Encodes options and routing information in the lower 64 bits.
- **MAC address based** (also called auto-configuration).
- **Low**: Uses only the last 12 bits.
- **Wordy**: Uses words that can be spelled in hexadecimal, like `BEEF`.
- **Privacy**: All bits are randomly set according to the IPv6 privacy specification [13].
- **v4 based**: When a corresponding IPv4 address influences the choice of host address.
- **Unidentified**: For all others.

#### 3.3 Transitional Technologies

The results of analyzing the IP address structure are presented in Table 2. Most of the native IPv6 addresses of the tier-1 ISP tended to communicate with other native IPv6 addresses; approximately 80% of addresses fell into this category. 6to4 addresses were also significant, representing approximately 18% of addresses seen. Teredo addresses constituted approximately 2%, and the remaining technologies were almost negligible. These results also match those found in a 2007 analysis [12]. Despite the different vantage point and time frame, the technologies used by organizations appear to remain unchanged for the past year.

From the tunneled perspective, we observed that Teredo and native addresses are popular. Moreover, around August 2008, a surge of Teredo-to-Teredo connections was noted.

#### 3.4 Assigning Addresses to Machines

In addition to looking at transitional technologies, we examined the breakdown of IPv6 address assignment schemes. Table 3 demonstrates the ratios of various host configurations. A few interesting trends emerged:
- **IPv4 based addresses** declined sharply (although there was an unexplained spike in August).
- **Privacy extensions** remained relatively unused, occupying a small percentage of all addresses (possibly because some operating systems do not enable privacy extensions by default).

#### 3.5 Application Mix

Analyzing the application breakdown yielded interesting results, as seen in Table 4. Expected traffic, like web and mail, was surprisingly lowâ€”usually between 1% to 8% for web and 1% to 2% for mail. We performed DNS reverse lookups on the few IPv6 addresses that used web protocols and found that popular sites include an IPv6 deployment and tunnel broker, and a backbone network for universities. On average, about 85% of traffic is DNS queries and 8% ICMP messages. Overall, these results are quite surprising. We believe there are two possible reasons:
1. People may be mainly using probing applications over their IPv6 networks rather than actual applications.
2. Operating systems like Windows Vista send an extra DNS request when IPv6 capabilities are turned on: one requesting the IPv4 address and one requesting the IPv6 address [14]. Thus, the IPv6 interface may send and receive DNS queries but not actual traffic.

Despite the potential inflation of DNS records in our data, there is still very little "real" traffic seen for IPv6. This suggests that, for at least this tier-1 ISP, customers view IPv6 as experimental.

For Teredo tunneled traffic, the application breakdown was also interesting. Table 4 shows that almost all traffic is unidentifiable UDP or TCP, indicating random port numbers. Given the vast quantity of unidentifiable traffic and the rise of Teredo pairs, it is likely that these are P2P applications communicating with each other (as random port numbers are characteristic of P2P traffic). Indeed, some applications have turned to Teredo to solve the issue faced by end hosts limited by their NAT/firewall technologies. Using the Teredo protocol, a client contacts a Teredo server, which acts as a broker agent between Teredo clients, aiding in NAT/firewall hole punching and providing unique IPv6 addresses. Several P2P clients, such as uTorrent and Vuze (formerly Azureus), have implemented IPv6 support [15], and uTorrent can set up Teredo automatically [16]. In summary, it appears that considerable tunneled IPv6 traffic is a by-product of applications (such as P2P file-sharing) using Teredo to bypass local NATs and firewalls, simplifying the application developers' jobs.

### 4. Related Work

IPv6 topology has been investigated by CAIDA's scamper work [17] and Hoerdt and Magoni's Network Cartographer [18]. Our work is complementary to these studies, as we did not investigate this aspect of IPv6 deployment.

Anomalous BGP behavior has been analyzed through Huston's automatically generated IPv6 reports [19]. These reports include information about routing instability, prefix aggregation, table sizes, and allocation sizes.

Testing the readiness of IPv6-enabled software occurred in February 2008 when NANOG shut off IPv4 access from their meeting for one hour [20]. This resulted in a severe restriction of services, revealing that IPv6-enabling software is still somewhat user-unfriendly [21]. We believe this work on how an individual can use IPv6 is complementary to our work on how organizations are using IPv6.

Regarding traffic analysis, Arbor Networks [22] found that IPv6 traffic is growing at the same rate as IPv4 traffic. Savola [23] analyzed 6to4 traffic and found much was experimental, noting a rise in P2P applications. Hei and Yamazaki [24] analyzed 6to4 traffic on a relay in Japan and found that TCP traffic dominated UDP, with a considerable amount of HTTP traffic (40% of total). Our work complements these studies by analyzing different data sources and offering a new perspective from a tier-1 ISP.

Finally, David Malone's work on IPv6 addresses analyzed transitional technologies and the assignment of IPv6 addresses to machines [12]. While we repeat some of the same analysis and use some of the same techniques, our study covers broader ground by looking at more data sources: RIR allocations, BGP data, NetFlow records, and packet header traces. We also perform additional analysis, such as address space allocation and latency.

### 5. Conclusion

While IPv6 is beginning to see larger deployments, it still faces significant barriers. IPv6 is still viewed as experimental by some and often deployed in counter-intuitive ways. By analyzing RIR and BGP data, it appears that many allocations are speculative, and autonomous systems wait significant amounts of time before actual announcement. Moreover, although IPv6 traffic is growing, our data from a US tier-1 ISP indicated that much of it is still DNS and ICMP packets, indicating a lack of true IPv6 applications from our vantage point. Additionally, tunneled traffic analysis shows much of the communication is between IPv4 pairs, implying that applications like P2P file sharing are dominant.

Further work would include a longer study of these characteristics, as well as a topological study involving more end hosts. It would also be interesting to track operating system developments and their support for various transitional schemes, as well as native support, to better understand how this software shapes the future of IPv6.
