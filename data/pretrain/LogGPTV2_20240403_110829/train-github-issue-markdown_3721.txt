No validation violation occurs on invalid values in EntityType.
This seems to be because EntityType uses ORMQueryBuilderLoader, and it's
getEntitiesByIds does not validate that the number of inputs matches the
number of outputs. It only does an SQL WHERE IN (provided IDs) query to get
whatever values are valid.
To replicate - add an entity in the form type on the form, then either
manually delete the entity in the database before submitting, or manipulate
the request (POST) data to have invalid values on submit. The invalid values
just drop, the valid values remain, and no validation error is raised.
I'm breaking this out from #17488 as that ticket is specifically addressing
that it causes exceptions when using PostgreSQL; however, the bigger issue is
that invalid values don't raise any validation.
This is not easy to workaround because $queryBuilder in ORMQueryBuilderLoader
is private rather than protected, so the variable and every method in the
class needs to be duplicated.
