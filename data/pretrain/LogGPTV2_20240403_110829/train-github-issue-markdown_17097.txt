As a typescript developer, I am building libraries for my client enterprise at
work. The libraries has a lot of interfaces, types, clases, enums,
variables... that are not intended to be public on the final comiled file, but
I'm forced to export them to reuse at the other inner modules (before coupling
them into one single file).
I would like to be able to generate de .d.ts file of my .js without the
`internal` members. I know they will be really accesible at JavaScript, but
not at the definitions file.
This is really significant because others could use those definicion files to
use the libraries, or to generate automatically public documentation (ie.
http://typedoc.io/).
