I am using the Chart.js library which does auto-sizing of the chart on window
resize. It does that by using setTimeout() and clearTimeout() when the event
is triggered.
The `clearTimeout` is tripping zone.js

Not sure if this is an issue with Angular or Zone or Chart.js. I tested
chart.js independently and it works fine for window resize, when not inside an
Angular component.
