User: How can one view the Google App Engine logs outside the Admin console?
I'm developing, so using dev_appserver.py/the Admin Console and would like to see the logs as the records are emitted.
I'd like to monitor the logging output in a console with standard Unix tools e.g. less/grep/etc, but there doesn't seem to be an option to direct the logging from the dev_appserver.py command, and I can't open a new file in GAE (e.g. a FileHandler), so file handlers won't work, and I think using a socket/udp handler would be a bit of overkill (if it's even possible).
I'm hopeful there are other options to view the log.
Thanks for reading.
Assistant: The default logger sends logging output to stderr. Use your shell's method of redirecting stderr to a file (in tcsh, (dev_appserver.py > /dev/tty) >& your_logfile.txt, your shell may vary.)
You can also use the logging module in python to change the logger to send directly to a file if you detect it's running locally (os.environ['SERVER_SOFTWARE'].startswith('Dev'))
