Figure 12 shows the results of the J-function for all 6 images.
It should be noted that these are discrete points and the lines were
added only for readability. J approaching 0 indicates that clusters
are occurring (J=0 indicates that all data points are in one cluster
within radius r). J approaching 1 means that the points are ran-
domly distributed, and J greater than 1 indicates that the points are
uniformly distributed (evenly spaced). Ideally, we want our click-
point distribution to be as close to J=1 as possible. We see from
Figure 12 that PassPoints suffers from clustering click-points. This
is a known issue with the original PassPoints scheme [7,13,20,33].
However, the important result here is that participants in the cur-
rent study were no more likely to select click-points that fell into
clusters than those participants who had only one password to re-
member. Figure 12 shows that the results for the two datasets are
very similar.
5. VALIDATION OF HYPOTHESES
We now revisit our hypotheses on multiple password interference
based on the results of our study.
1. Participants will have lower recall success rates with text
passwords than with PassPoints passwords. Hypothesis
partially supported. Users in the PassPoints condition had
signiﬁcantly higher recall success rates in the short-term. How-
ever, after two weeks, participants in both groups had simi-
larly low success rates.
2. Participants in the Text condition are more likely than
PassPoints participants to use patterns across their pass-
words. Hypothesis partially supported. We found that 53%
of participants in the Text condition created passwords fol-
lowing a common pattern across their accounts. In compar-
ison, only two PassPoints participants used the same click-
point pattern for most of their accounts. Although it appeared
508that Text passwords had more evidence of patterns, we could
not perform a direct comparison since the measures were dif-
ferent for the two types of passwords.
3. Participants will recall text passwords more slowly than
PassPoints passwords. Hypothesis partially supported. Over-
all, participants in the Text condition were slower to recall
their passwords than PassPoints participants in the short-term.
We believe this result will surprise many in the community.
One factor inﬂuencing this result is that Text participants
made more errors, so spent more time re-entering their pass-
word. When considering only successful ﬁrst attempts, there
is no signiﬁcant difference in password entry times between
the Text and PassPoints conditions. After two weeks, Text
participants who were successful on the ﬁrst attempt entered
their password more quickly than PassPoints participants.
There was no signiﬁcant difference between the two condi-
tions when the overall time for Recall-2 is considered.
4. Participants in the Text condition are more likely than
PassPoints participants to create passwords that are di-
rectly related to their corresponding accounts. Hypoth-
esis supported. We found that 68% of participants in the
Text condition used the account name or type as a mnemonic
to create a password that was obviously related to its ac-
count. We found no evidence that participants in the Pass-
Points condition created account-related passwords. In fact,
it is not clear how one would create account-related pass-
words in such click-based graphical password schemes.
5. Participants in the Text condition will make more recall
errors than participants in the PassPoints condition. Hy-
pothesis supported. Users in the Text condition made signif-
icantly more recall errors than those in the PassPoints con-
dition during both Recall-1 and Recall-2. Participants in the
Text condition were more likely to make repeated attempts at
entering their password, behaviour which is potentially dan-
gerous since it may reveal other passwords in the presence
of key loggers or if on phishing sites. PassPoints participants
opted to indicate that they had forgotten their password rather
than engaging in this potentially insecure behaviour. Having
passwords based on different images dissuaded users from
cycling through passwords.
6. DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
Cued-recall is a cognitively simpler task than uncued recall and
many users will attempt to turn remembering their password into
a cued-recall task. This user strategy often means that text pass-
words are weaker because they are likely based on some obvious
and common cues, such as account or website names.
In the short-term, PassPoints passwords are easier to recall than
text passwords when participants have several passwords to re-
member. We suspect that having a cue helped PassPoints partici-
pants remember which password was associated with each account.
It appears that participants in the Text condition created mnemonics
in order to have an association between an account (or its banner)
and its password. For example, many participants with text pass-
words included the word “email” in the password for their email
account. This common strategy appeared to help participants re-
call their passwords since short-term success rates were consider-
ably higher for those who used account-related passwords (see Sec-
tion 4.4). However, our results indicate that this strategy was not
effective when recalling passwords two weeks later.
Prior to participating in our study, none of our PassPoints partici-
pants had previous experience with graphical passwords. However,
all our Text participants had much past experience with text pass-
words. As such, Text participants a substantial advantage when
recalling passwords two weeks later, since they had already devel-
oped behaviours to help them choose more memorable passwords
(see Section 4.4). As there was no difference in two-week recall
performance between the two conditions, the PassPoints partici-
pants also had an advantage: the image as a recall cue. Note how-
ever that the Text participants’ use of mnemonics inherently leads
to insecure passwords, while PassPoints’ image cue does not. Thus,
we believe that if a similar cueing mechanism could somehow be
added to text password systems, their security could be improved
without sacriﬁcing memorability.
The role of the images as cues suggests that images provided by
the system should be distinct, otherwise confusion and interference
can become a problem. Our strong intuition is that users should
not be asked to remember different passwords on the same image,
as we suspect that interference problems would be highly likely in
that case. Not only is using the same images across systems prob-
lematic for usability, it also decreases security since users are likely
to re-use passwords. Similarly, a system could allow users to select
or upload personal images. However, this would enable password
reuse if users upload the same image for several accounts, which
has a security cost and may lead to greater memory interference if
the exact same password is not selected for each account. Addi-
tionally, Davis et al. [11] recommend against allowing user choice
in graphical passwords. Click-based graphical passwords can offer
a compromise by using system-assigned images and allowing user
choice of click-points within the image.
Using account-related mnemonics is problematic for security. It
may make it easier to guess account-related passwords since the
mnemonic remains constant across all participants and is also avail-
able to attackers.
It can also be problematic for usability when
participants are required to change their passwords. A user who
changes a password may still associate the account-related mnemonic
with the old password and have more difﬁculty remembering the
new password.
Our intent in this study was to examine the effects of password
interference on user behaviour and performance. We followed es-
tablished psychological methods for clearing working (short-term)
memory by administering a distraction task, and adopted a cogni-
tively challenging design to avoid ceiling effects [22]. However,
we acknowledge that this lab study does not mirror real-life usage.
Users are unlikely to create 6 new passwords one after the other
in quick succession in real life, or be asked to recall them all in
quick succession after two weeks (without having used any of them
in the intervening time). Albeit unusual, circumstances do some-
times require users to create multiple passwords in a short time pe-
riod, for example, when starting a new job. For the purpose of our
comparison, both the text passwords and the PassPoints passwords
were created and recalled under similar conditions. Furthermore,
although no one in our study wrote down their password, users of-
ten do so with their real passwords. This acts as a useful memory
aid, but has security risks if anyone gains access to a user’s written
list of passwords. And lastly, users were told in the instructions
to the study that their passwords were for 6 speciﬁc accounts. Al-
though this reﬂects the implicit reality in practice, mentioning this
explicitly may have primed users to select more account-speciﬁc
passwords. Despite these limitations, examining the issue of mul-
tiple password interference in a controlled laboratory setting is an
important step in understanding the effects of increased memory
load and the coping behaviours exhibited by users.
509Many passwords created in both the Text and PassPoints con-
ditions were weak. For example, Text participants used account-
based passwords and used similar passwords across accounts, while
PassPoints participants created passwords that included patterns
and formed hotspots across participants. We believe that while
PassPoints passwords are often weak, this does not diminish the
results of our study, and may be addressed with alternative click-
based graphical password systems (see related discussion in Sec-
tion 2). Future work includes testing for multiple password inter-
ference with these alternative schemes and conducting a ﬁeld study
to further examine the effect of multiple password interference in
a more ecologically valid setting. To provide more accurate com-
parison between graphical passwords and text passwords, it may
also be necessary to help users become more familiar with graph-
ical passwords beforehand so that their behaviour is more natural
and to avoid novelty effects.
7. CONCLUSION
Results of our lab study indicate that in the short-term, Pass-
Points passwords are more robust than text passwords against mul-
tiple password interference (assuming distinct background images).
Often, the usability of a system is tested in isolation but in the
case of passwords this is especially problematic because user be-
haviour may change as users accumulate passwords. We show that
in the short-term, participants could more easily remember multi-
ple click-based graphical passwords than multiple text passwords.
Participants in the Text condition made signiﬁcantly more recall
errors and resorted to additional coping strategies such as using
account-based passwords or cycling through all of their passwords
when trying to recall their password. We believe the memory cue-
ing provided by click-based graphical passwords is at least part of
the reason for better user performance and that cueing should be
part of any recall-based authentication scheme, where possible.
After two weeks, recall of the passwords in the text and graphi-
cal conditions was not statistically different from each other. Given
that users were much more familiar with memorizing and recall-
ing text passwords, they were better positioned to remember these
passwords. However, this advantage was offset by the graphical
passwords’ built-in memory cue, which is a more secure memory
aid than users’ typical text password coping mechanisms. Our re-
sults raise an interesting research question for text passwords: can
cueing mechanisms be (safely) added to text passwords in order
to achieve the same memorability advantages seen in click-based
graphical passwords?
