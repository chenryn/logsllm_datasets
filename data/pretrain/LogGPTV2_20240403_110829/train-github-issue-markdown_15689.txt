## üêõ Bug

Our autodifferentiation (autodiff) infrastructure is experiencing issues with double backward operations for certain formulas, such as `layer_norm` and `linear`. Specifically, the problem arises from the premature expiration of the `grad_accumulator` for these formulas. The error message is as follows:

```
File "test/test_jit.py", line 659, in checkTrace
    grads2_ge = torch.autograd.grad(l2_ge, flattened_recording_inputs, allow_unused=allow_unused)
File "/scratch/wanchaol/local/pytorch/torch/autograd/__init__.py", line 149, in grad
    inputs, allow_unused)
RuntimeError: No grad accumulator for a saved leaf!
```

This issue is present in the current master branch. It is somewhat complex to trigger: when a non-trivial autodiff formula is added, some non-trivial models may throw the above error, even though they run fine in pure Autograd mode.

## To Reproduce

I first noticed this problem after adding an AD formula for `linear` in PR #20039, which was part of the changes in #20284.

1. Fetch and checkout the specific branch:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   git checkout gh/wanchaol/5/origin
   ```
2. Install the package in development mode:
   ```sh
   python setup.py develop
   ```
3. Run the test:
   ```sh
   python test/test_jit.py TestEndToEndHybridFrontendModels.test_vae
   ```

## Expected Behavior

The test should pass both in Autograd mode and in JIT Autodiff mode. Currently, the test runs successfully in Autograd mode but fails in JIT Autodiff mode when computing the second derivative, resulting in the error mentioned above. This issue seems to be related to the early release of one of the leaf `Variable` objects in our autodiff infrastructure.
