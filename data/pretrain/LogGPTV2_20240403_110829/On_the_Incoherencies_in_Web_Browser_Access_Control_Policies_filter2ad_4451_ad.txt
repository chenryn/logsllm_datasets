### Summary of Display Layouts for Top 100,000 Alexa Websites (December 2009)
**Table V: Analysis of 89,483 Successfully Rendered Sites**

- **Iframe Embedding**: 41% of sites embed at least one iframe, with an average of 3.2 iframes per site.
- **Overlapping Iframes**: 6.2% of sites contain at least one pair of overlapping iframes, but only 29% of these overlaps involve transparent iframes.
- **Cross-Origin Overlaps**: 68% of overlapping scenarios involve different principals.

| Access browser’s history | 1,910 | 721 | 0.81% |
| Use of `defaultStatus` (write) | 1,576 | 241 | 0.27% |
| Read user’s Geolocation | 251 | 149 | 0.17% |
| Use of `resizeTo` | 339 | 134 | 0.15% |
| Use of `defaultStatus` (read) | 528 | 108 | 0.12% |
| Use of `moveTo` | 258 | 100 | 0.11% |
| Close a window | 130 | 86 | 0.10% |
| Access user’s clipboard | 24 | 17 | 0.02% |
| Blur a window | 54 | 13 | 0.01% |
| Use of `resizeBy` | 13 | 8 | 0.01% |
| Use of `moveBy` | 4 | 1 | 0.00% |

### Summary of Findings

- **DOM and Cookies Interplay**: High compatibility impact.
- **Cookies and XMLHttpRequest Interplay**: Affecting only 0.30% of sites.
- **Display Interplays**: Descendant navigation can be disallowed with no cost, while disallowing transparent cross-origin frame overlaps affects 1.2% of sites.
- **Document Domain Impact**: Significant usage (1.9% of sites), but impacts on XMLHttpRequest, local storage, and postMessage can be mitigated at a lower cost (0.19% of sites).
- **Effective Principal ID**: 1.9% of sites change their effective domain via `document.domain`, affecting 1.76% of sites for cookie access and 0.08% for XMLHttpRequest.

### Methodology Validation and Correlation with Site Popularity

- **User-Driven Analysis**: Manual examination of the top 100 Alexa sites confirmed the heuristic-driven approach, with some variations in feature prevalence.
- **Popularity Bias**: Most features do not exhibit significant popularity bias, but some, like `document.domain`, are more common on higher-ranked sites, while `postMessage` is more common on lower-ranked sites.
- **Cross-Frame Communication**: Fragment identifier messaging is most popular (3.8% of sites), followed by `postMessage` (0.95%).
