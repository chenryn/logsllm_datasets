### Issue with Neo4j Version 2.1.1 Installation

**Environment:**
- Neo4j Version: 2.1.1
- Installation Method: Tarball
- Operating System: Ubuntu

**Problem Description:**

After installing Neo4j and accessing the browser interface at `/browser/`, the following HTTP requests are observed to be constantly spinning:

1. `OPTIONS http://192.168.1.152:7474/db/data` - Returns `HTTP/1.1 302 Found` in 0ms.
2. `OPTIONS http://192.168.1.152:7474/db/data/` - Returns `HTTP/1.1 204 No Content` in 0ms.

These constant requests cause the web browser to become unresponsive, with frequent freezes.

**Performance Analysis:**

Using the Firefox Developer Console for JavaScript profiling, it was found that more than 50% of the execution time is spent in the function `WCF__flushMessageQueue`.

**Next Steps:**

1. Investigate the cause of the constant `OPTIONS` requests.
2. Analyze the `WCF__flushMessageQueue` function to identify any potential bottlenecks.
3. Consider updating to a newer version of Neo4j if the issue persists, as this may be a known bug in the 2.1.1 release.
