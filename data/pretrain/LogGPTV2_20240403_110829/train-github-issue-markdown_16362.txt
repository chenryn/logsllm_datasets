Neo4J Version 2.1.1 - new install (tarball).
Go to /browser/ in web browser and you will find that the following HTTP
requests are constantly spinning:
OPTIONS http://192.168.1.152:7474/db/data [HTTP/1.1 302 Found 0ms]  
OPTIONS http://192.168.1.152:7474/db/data/ [HTTP/1.1 204 No Content 0ms]
It causes the browser to become unresponsive with regular freezes (in Ubuntu).
Profiling the javascript code using firefox console shows that more than 50%
of time is spent in: WCF__flushMessageQueue. Will enclose screenshot.
