For historical reasons, the scan implementation first returns the count and then provides the hits in subsequent requests. In contrast, regular search scrolling immediately returns the first N results.

It would be beneficial if the SCAN operation could behave more like regular scrolling. One potential approach could be to automatically execute in "scan" mode when the sort parameter is set to an empty array or a similar condition. This way, the "scan" search type would simply be a variant of the standard scrolling behavior, providing a more consistent and intuitive user experience.
