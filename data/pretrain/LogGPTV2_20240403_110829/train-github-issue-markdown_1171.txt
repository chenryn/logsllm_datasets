For historic reasons, scan implementation returns first the count, and then
the hits in subsequent requests. While scrolling with regular search returns
the first N results immediately.
It would be nice if SCAN behaved the same as regular scrolling? Maybe even
automatically execute in "scan" mode if sort is set to an empty array or
something like that, and scan search type is just a flavor on that?
