6.4.3 Variations Across Multiple Participants
7 Discussion
To understand the dependency of Keynergy’s accuracy on hu-
man factors, due to attributes such as age, sex and key gripping
preferences, we recruit 10 participants, {P1, . . . , P10} (demo-
graphics in Appendix E), where participant P1 corresponds to
the participant in Section 6.2.2, and capture audio recordings
from each of them, with the Miccond, for a total of six keys,
{key1, . . . , key6}, in increasing order of cluster distinctness.
From Figure 19(a), we observe a high RatioReduction of 86%
(σ = 19%) across all participants and keys, while achieving
an even higher RatioReduction of 92% (σ = 10%) without key1.
Similar to previous results, from Figure 19(b), we observe
that key1 exhibits lower average RatioReduction of 57% due to
poor cluster detection for four (out of ten) participants. Partici-
pants, P6 and P10, encounter issues in cluster detection for keys
{key2, key3} respectively, although they individually achieve
more than 87% RatioReduction for the rest of the keys. While
some participants achieve low reduction for certain keys, the
RatioReduction across different participants tends to depend
more on speciﬁc instances of insertions than the demographic
characteristics and personal traits of the participants.
6.4.4 Variations Over Time
We capture audio recordings with the Miccond across ten days,
{day1, . . . , day10}, where day1 corresponds to the subset of
data presented in Section 6.2.2. Figure 19(c) depicts the mean
RatioReduction across the ten days of 78% (σ = 25%). High
variability in the results can be attributed to two keys, key1 and
key5 as depicted in Figure 19(d). As expected, key1 achieves a
low RatioReduction of 56% (σ = 12%) across all days due to its
low cluster distinctness. On the other hand, key5 occasionally
detects additional clicks in the noise ﬂoor, which results in no
reduction, although it achieves correct cluster detection due
to its high cluster distinctness.
We now discuss limitations of Keynergy, potential counter-
measures against it, and its generalizability to other locks.
Limitations. Despite Keynergy’s considerable keyspace re-
duction under several experimental conditions, it has the fol-
lowing limitations. Keynergy’s attack accuracy is affected by
high-frequency noise, although it remains robust to most com-
mon noises (such as human-chatter and dog-bark). In addition,
our approach requires microphones with frequency response
above 20kHz (present in most smartphones) in order to detect
clicks, rendering consumer IoT devices with low-end mics
such as smart doorbells unsuitable, despite their proximity to
the door lock (see Appendix G). In the same vein, prolonged
usage of keys can affect our inference by smoothing ridges
in keys, thereby degrading the sharpness of click sounds and
their detection accuracy. However, certain keys in our exper-
iments have been inserted well over 300 times, with little
impact on their click pattern, hence indicating the effective-
ness of our attack for long durations. Lastly, we believe that
despite our best attempts to design an inference framework
that handles varying insertion speeds and mic types, its accu-
racy can be improved, not with availability of better hardware,
but with modeling of human factors behind key insertions.
Countermeasures. We envision the following countermea-
sures. First, physical modiﬁcations that modify the target lock
design to make them attack-resistant could be implemented,
e.g., lock companies may produce keys with noise-dampening
material (similar to 3D printed keys [20]), to reduce key inser-
tion sound. However, such mitigation would require changes
in manufacturing, and would not protect vulnerable keys al-
ready in circulation. The lock industry could also transition
to more secure pin-tumbler lock designs, such as the Bow-
ley locks [3] which have no ridges that cause click sounds,
hence making them potentially immune to audio-based key
inference. Second, from our analysis, lock manufacturers can
identify vulnerable keys (i.e., keys with distinct clusters), and
avoid their production/sale. However, removing all such keys,
i.e., 79% of keys (see Appendix F) would likely introduce

new attack avenues due to reduced keyspace. Hence, manufac-
turers need to strike a balance by discarding keys with higher
cluster distinctness as they may be more susceptible to Keyn-
ergy’s attack, while maintaining a sufﬁciently large keyspace.
Third, we envision injecting noise to corrupt key insertion
sounds. This can be achieved by ﬁrst detecting the key inser-
tion event (from video footage of outdoor cameras or smart
doorbells), and playing inaudible sounds of frequency greater
than 15kHz, using devices such as smart doorbells. Further-
more, noise signals should exhibit temporal variations (in
frequency or amplitude), as Keynergy’s acoustic inference uti-
lizes energy differences over time for detecting clicks, hence
making constant noise an ineffective defense. Alternately, in-
stead of detecting key insertion, inaudible noise can be played
continuously, although this consumes more power.
Generalizability. Although empirical evaluations of Keyn-
ergy’s framework were conducted on Schlage 5-pin locks,
due to the similarity of the pin tumbler lock design across the
industry, Keynergy can be easily tailored to attack other com-
mon lock models, including those with more than ﬁve pins.
Our preliminary analyses on Kwikset and Yale 5-pin locks, as
well as Schlage 6-pin locks show promise. As part of future
work, we consider extending Keynergy’s design for tackling
high-security pin tumblers such as Mul-T-Lock cylinders that
have telescoping pins design (i.e., pin within pin), hence re-
quiring inferring ten bittings in place of ﬁve, and Medeco
Biaxial, that have keys with angled bitting cuts, thereby ne-
cessitating guessing angles together with bittings [54].
Keynergy’s approach of leveraging time-intervals between
audible clicks has broader applicability beyond lock security.
In the past, researchers have designed “acoustic barcodes” by
creating structured patterns on objects which when swiped
produce a series of click sounds, where the timing between
adjacent clicks encodes information [29]. On similar lines,
we believe click timing information can be exploited for com-
municating secret information via covert channels.
8 Related Work
We now present related work that investigates the security of
physical locks, and acoustic side-channels.
Physical Locks Security. There have been several attacks
compromising the security of lock mechanisms in a non-
destructive manner, which can be broadly divided into two cat-
egories. The ﬁrst type of attacks requires physical access to the
lock during attack execution, such as bumping, lock picking
and rights ampliﬁcation in pin tumbler locks [16, 48, 49, 70].
The second type, to which Keynergy belongs, is stealthy ofﬂine
attacks that involve passively capturing sensor information in
order to infer the keycode [32, 33, 35, 39, 55, 61]. One such
work Sneakey proposes to use a telephotography camera to
infer bittings based on still images [35]. Although a novel
approach, Sneakey makes several unrealistic assumptions, in-
cluding requiring a high-resolution image of a stationary key
placed at a certain angle, thus greatly reducing its practical
feasibility. Another related effort, SpiKey [55], proposes a key
inference framework that employs simulations of acoustic
emanation from key insertions. One of SpiKey’s main draw-
backs is that it assumes a constant insertion speed, and thus
would not work in practical settings where users insert keys
with varying speeds. Keynergy addresses these challenges that
arise due to unknown and inconsistent key insertion speeds,
and in addition, achieves reasonable key space reduction even
at distances up to 25 feet at varying noise levels.
Acoustic Side-Channels. Several sensor-based side-channel
attacks have been proposed to infer conﬁdential information
such as cryptographic keys [28], ATM pins [43], keystrokes
[12, 38, 40, 42], taps on a touch screen [21, 50] and stylus
pen writing [36] among many others. Speciﬁcally, within the
audio domain, researchers have exploited acoustic leakage
from various physical components including laptop’s power
supply unit [28], computer screens [27], keyboards [10, 71],
3D printers [30, 62] and DNA synthesizers [24] to infer pri-
vate information. Different from the above works, Keynergy
utilizes the sound emanated from physical locks and keys
during the event of key insertion to infer the key’s secret code.
9 Conclusion
We propose Keynergy, a novel stealthy ofﬂine attack that infers
the victim’s key bittings by extending and improving the prior
image-only attack by utilizing the audible clicks captured
during victim’s key insertion. Keynergy combines insufﬁcient
information from each of the sensing modalities, namely au-
dio and video, which complement each other to yield a novel
and practical side-channel attack. Keynergy overcomes the
shortcomings of traditional attacks on pin tumbler locks of
requiring physical access to the lock throughout the attack,
which increases the chances of the attacker getting caught. We
conduct proof-of-concept real-world experiments by recruit-
ing 13 participants and testing with 75 different keys, totaling
more than 3,600 insertions. We examine the impact of vary-
ing real-world conditions, including eavesdropping distance
and ambient noise levels across different microphone types.
With acoustics alone, Keynergy obtains an average keyspace
reduction of 75% and on combining acoustics and visual infor-
mation, Keynergy achieves a reduction in keyspace below ten
keys for 8% of the keys (i.e., six keys out of 75 keys tested).
