# Keynergy: An Acoustic Side-Channel Attack on Pin Tumbler Locks

## 6.4.3 Variations Across Multiple Participants

To understand the impact of human factors on Keynergy’s accuracy, we recruited 10 participants, denoted as {P1, ..., P10}, with varying demographics (see Appendix E). Participant P1 is the same individual mentioned in Section 6.2.2. We recorded audio data using the Miccond for six keys, {key1, ..., key6}, arranged in increasing order of cluster distinctness.

From Figure 19(a), we observe a high average RatioReduction of 86% (σ = 19%) across all participants and keys. Excluding key1, the RatioReduction improves to 92% (σ = 10%). As shown in Figure 19(b), key1 has a lower average RatioReduction of 57% due to poor cluster detection for four out of ten participants. Participants P6 and P10 faced issues with cluster detection for keys key2 and key3, respectively, but achieved over 87% RatioReduction for other keys. The results indicate that the RatioReduction is more influenced by specific instances of key insertions rather than demographic characteristics or personal traits.

## 6.4.4 Variations Over Time

We conducted audio recordings over ten days, {day1, ..., day10}, with day1 corresponding to the subset of data from Section 6.2.2. Figure 19(c) shows the mean RatioReduction across the ten days at 78% (σ = 25%). The variability in results can be attributed to key1 and key5, as depicted in Figure 19(d). Key1 consistently exhibits a low RatioReduction of 56% (σ = 12%) due to its low cluster distinctness. Key5 occasionally detects additional clicks in the noise floor, leading to no reduction, despite its high cluster distinctness.

## 7. Discussion

### Limitations
Keynergy demonstrates significant keyspace reduction under various experimental conditions, but it has several limitations:
- **High-Frequency Noise:** Keynergy's accuracy is affected by high-frequency noise, though it remains robust against common noises like human chatter and dog barks.
- **Microphone Requirements:** Our approach requires microphones with a frequency response above 20kHz, which are common in smartphones but not in low-end consumer IoT devices like smart doorbells.
- **Prolonged Usage:** Prolonged use of keys can smooth ridges, degrading click sound sharpness and detection accuracy. However, some keys in our experiments were inserted over 300 times with minimal impact.
- **Inference Framework:** Despite efforts to handle varying insertion speeds and mic types, further improvements in modeling human factors could enhance accuracy.

### Countermeasures
We propose the following countermeasures:
- **Physical Modifications:** Lock manufacturers could produce keys with noise-dampening materials or transition to designs like Bowley locks, which have no ridges producing click sounds.
- **Key Selection:** Manufacturers can avoid producing and selling vulnerable keys with distinct clusters, but this must be balanced to maintain a sufficiently large keyspace.
- **Noise Injection:** Injecting inaudible noise (above 15kHz) using devices like smart doorbells can corrupt key insertion sounds. This noise should vary temporally to be effective.

### Generalizability
Keynergy was tested on Schlage 5-pin locks, but its design can be adapted to other pin tumbler lock models, including those with more pins. Preliminary tests on Kwikset and Yale 5-pin locks, and Schlage 6-pin locks, show promise. Future work will extend Keynergy to high-security locks like Mul-T-Lock cylinders and Medeco Biaxial.

The method of leveraging time intervals between audible clicks has broader applications, such as in acoustic barcodes for covert communication.

### Physical Locks Security
Several non-destructive attacks on physical locks exist, categorized into two types:
- **Physical Access Attacks:** Techniques like bumping, lock picking, and rights amplification.
- **Stealthy Offline Attacks:** Passive sensor-based methods to infer keycodes, such as Sneakey (telephotography) and SpiKey (acoustic simulations).

### Acoustic Side-Channels
Sensor-based side-channel attacks have been used to infer confidential information, including cryptographic keys, ATM PINs, keystrokes, and more. Keynergy uniquely utilizes the sound from key insertions to infer the key's secret code.

## 9. Conclusion
Keynergy is a novel, stealthy offline attack that infers key bittings by combining audio and video data. It overcomes the need for continuous physical access, reducing the risk of detection. Real-world experiments with 13 participants and 75 keys, involving over 3,600 insertions, showed an average keyspace reduction of 75% using acoustics alone. Combining acoustics and visual information, Keynergy reduced the keyspace below ten keys for 8% of the tested keys.
