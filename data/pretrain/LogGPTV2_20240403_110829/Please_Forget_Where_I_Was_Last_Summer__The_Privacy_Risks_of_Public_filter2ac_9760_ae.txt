proach. Employing both approaches can increase conﬁdence in
identifying sensitive places the users have visited. For scenar-
ios requiring higher levels of conﬁdence, attackers can select
the intersection of the sets returned by the two approaches.
Another noteworthy observation is that
the DB approach
results in a higher ratio of sex-related clusters compared to CB,
which indicates that users are reluctant to explicitly mention
such venues, further highlighting the risk of geotagged tweets.
Contextual privacy loss. A signiﬁcant implication of this
inference is that location metadata can amplify the loss of pri-
vacy by revealing sensitive details or additional context about
the tweet’s content that might not match the user’s intended
level of disclosure. While we found this to be common across
most cases of sensitive clusters we identiﬁed, it is not our
goal to quantify or exhaustively enumerate this phenomenon.
Instead, we anecdotally refer to a few representative examples
that highlight this dimension of privacy leakage. In one case,
the user expressed negative feelings about his/her doctor, while
the GPS coordinates place the user in the ofﬁce of a mental
health professional. In another example, the user complained
about some blood tests, while being geo-located at a rehab
center. Also, geotagged religion-based tweets can reveal the
type of that place of worship (e.g., mosque, synagogue) and
may even point to a speciﬁc denomination. However, even if
users are cautious and nothing sensitive is disclosed in the
tweets, the location information obtainable with our duration-
based approach can result in signiﬁcant privacy loss.
C. Impact of Historical Data
During our analysis we found that Twitter app versions
released prior to April 2015 automatically include GPS coor-
dinates in tweets tagged with a coarse location. The tweets
have both a coarse-grained label (e.g., city) and coordinates in
their metadata. Furthermore, that information is not visible in
the app or web version. Thus, users are completely oblivious to
the public availability of this sensitive data. In newer versions
users have to explicitly opt to include GPS information on
a per-tweet basis. The apps with a more privacy-respecting
behavior were released on April 15th for iOS and the 20th for
Android. Nonetheless, the historical metadata collected from
prior versions remains publicly accessible through the API.
Unavoidable privacy leakage. As shown in Figure 9 user
behavior changes after April 2015, with far fewer tweets with
precise location, and users tagging tweets with the newly
introduced point-of-interest (POI) that denotes locations of
varying granularity. Table VI shows that there is signiﬁcant
change, with a 35-fold reduction in the ratio of tweets that

contain GPS coordinates after the release dates of the apps
with the privacy-respecting approach. Since we do not have
the ability to detect each user’s app version, we ﬁrst separate
the data on the ofﬁcial release date for each platform (i.e., we
take into account if the user is on Android or iOS). While some
users may have delayed updating their app, that would only
increase the ratio of tweets with GPS; thus, the actual reduction
of tweets with GPS is even higher, further highlighting the
unavoidable privacy violation that users faced due to Twitter’s
poor handling of location data. While we expected that all
coarse-grained tweets from before 04/2015 would contain GPS
coordinates, we found that ∼0.1% do not. These were all
from before 08/2010 indicating the point in time when Twitter
started the practice of appending GPS data to coarse-grained
tweets. Consequently this privacy-invasive policy persisted for
almost 5 years until Twitter gave users greater control over
the location information they exposed. Nonetheless, users with
older devices or versions of the app are still exposing this type
of data, while all users’ data remains accessible online.
Historical data. We explored the impact of Twitter main-
taining and publicly sharing historical location metadata, by
calculating how many users would remain vulnerable if GPS
coordinates were not included in coarse-grained tweets. In
Figure 10 we ﬁrst look at the number of days that have passed
since the last tweet from a home/work location. We ﬁnd that
56.57% and 68.45% of the users posted their last tweet from
home right before the release of the newer app version, a large
percentage around the dates of the app release, and only a small
number after that. As we do not have information regarding the
date each user installed the newer app version on their device,
we cannot know the exact numbers. However, it is evident
that the majority of users stopped posting tweets with precise
location information from their home and work locations.
To further investigate how users’ behavior changed since
Twitter changed its policy, we identiﬁed the users that have
posted tweets with coordinates after the app release date (and
the following weeks) and ran LPAuditor only on the tweets

posted after those dates. As can be seen in Table VII, as users
started updating their apps, the number of users posting tweets
with precise location drops rapidly. Indicatively, only 15.43%
and 11.12% of the users in the two datasets continued posting
such tweets four weeks after the release of the new app. When
using only tweets posted at least four weeks after the app
release, we were able to correctly identify the home of 7.34%
and 6.39% of the users that are identiﬁed when all data is used.
Regarding the “freshness” of historical data, it is important
to note that even if some of the users’ locations have changed
(e.g., a user has moved to a different home), users can still be
identiﬁed by that data, and the inferred sensitive information
does not “expire”. The sensitive user traits, actions or beliefs
that can be inferred by the three categories that we explore will
still characterize the users regardless of the current location of
their home or workplace. Even for ephemeral characteristics
that no longer hold true, exposure of that sensitive information
can still affect users (e.g., certain cured medical issues remain
social taboos). As such, given the adage that “the Web never
forgets”, Twitter’s invasive privacy policy cannot be dismissed
as a case of a vulnerability that has been ﬁxed. As long as this
historical data persists online, users will continue to face the
signiﬁcant privacy risks that we have highlighted in this paper.
D. Performance evaluation
To evaluate our system’s performance we randomly se-
lected 1000 users from all users with geotagged tweets and
measured the time required by each LPAuditor module, and
the total time, for completing the entire process. As expected,
this time depends on the number of tweets and clusters of
each user; as such, we randomly chose the users to reﬂect a
representative distribution. As Figure 11 shows, the most time
demanding operations are those of collecting tweets, collecting
PSCs, and the ﬁrst-level clustering all of which rely on the use
of third-party APIs (i.e., network communication, rate limits,
etc.). Contrarily, the time required for the other steps are in the
order of milliseconds, which can be considered as negligible.
Fig. 11: Time required by LPAuditor for each phase of the
process. The reported numbers are for a subset of 1,000 users
randomly selected from all the users with geotagged tweets.
Using a commodity desktop, LPAuditor requires less that
12 seconds for collecting all the tweets of roughly half the
users, and less than 20 seconds for around 98% of the users.
Furthermore, for the collection of PSCs it takes up to six
seconds for half of the users, and more than 29 and 66 seconds
for 15% and 5% of the users respectively. For the process of
clustering, our system takes up to 35 seconds for about 50%
of the users, and more than 164 and 305 seconds for 15% and
5% of the users. To that end, when considering the total time
spent, LPAuditor takes less than 52 seconds for half of the
users, and more than 207 and 385 for 15% and 5% of them
(users with a very large number of tweets and clusters). Our
system can complete the whole process in less than a minute
for half the users, while approximately 95% of them can be
processed within six minutes. This highlights the severity and
scale of the privacy threat we have explored, as adversaries
could trivially run such attacks for a massive number of users.
VI. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
Twitter privacy leakage mitigation. The pitfalls of
location-sharing have long troubled researchers. And while
our work demonstrates the extent of the risks users face,
it also highlights an important aspect of the issue that, to
our knowledge, has not been explored before. While previous
work has mainly focused on users knowingly or inadvertently
sharing location data in social platforms, we also identiﬁed
an inconspicuous form of privacy leakage that is invisible
to users. Even though Twitter has since opted for a more
privacy-oriented policy where users have to explicitly choose
to append GPS coordinates in tweets,
the availability of
historical metadata severely undermines the beneﬁts of this
more recent approach. Apart from the fact that after users are
given the choice they are 18.5 times less likely to include GPS
coordinates, ∼93% of the users identiﬁed by LPAuditor are due
to the historical tweets geotagged by Twitter. These ﬁndings
underline the risks of web services publicly over-sharing data
through their APIs, which poses an alarming ﬂip side to the
common problematic behavior of over-collecting data [61].
We found that Twitter mentions this behavior [9] and de-
scribes the process for removing location data [10]. However,
they warn that “deleting location information on Twitter does

of the data on third-party applications or in external search
results”. As data brokers continuously collect and sell Twitter
data, even if users remove all location metadata, those changes
might not be reﬂected in the versions maintained by others.
Ideally, our study will act as a deterrent against publishing
sensitive metadata not explicitly broadcast by users (interest-
ingly, a recent study explored how other types of metadata can
uniquely identify a user [51]). While the availability of public
Twitter data has facilitated innovative and impactful research,
the privacy threats that users face remains an important issue.
This is further exacerbated by the signiﬁcant ramiﬁcations for
users that rely on the pseudonymous nature of Twitter [47].
While Twitter offers a partial solution for mitigating the
privacy risks of this (historical) data, there exists no foolproof
course of action for completely eradicating this threat.
Applicability. The techniques used by our system for in-
ferring users’ home and work locations are not tied to Twitter,
but can be readily applied to any (sparse) location dataset that
contains periodic GPS entries and timestamps. For datasets
that contain very frequent snapshots of a user’s location (e.g.,
collected every couple of seconds), a simple form of sampling
should be sufﬁcient for reducing the computational overhead
that can arise. And while our content-based technique for
inferring sensitive locations is not applicable to every service
as it relies on the tweets’ content, our duration-based technique
can also be applied to any location dataset.
LPAuditor adoption. Recent headlines regarding third
parties harvesting personal user information in services like
Facebook [8] have reignited the public discourse over user
privacy and data protection. Facebook has announced plans
for offering users more control over their data [5] and Twitter
is aiming for increased transparency due to the new GDPR
requirements [7]. As such, it is evident that there is need for
tools and techniques that can inform users about what data
of theirs is exposed. And while certain cases of data exposure
can be self-evident, sensitive information inference may be less
obvious. To that end, LPAuditor can be incorporated by any
location-based service or social network for clearly notifying
users of such exposure. For services that do not obfuscate
locations, users can also explore user-side location-obfuscation
tools like LP-Doctor [27] or an app for location spooﬁng [55].
Ethical considerations and disclosure. As is the case with
any study that explores user privacy, it is important to address
the ethical implications of our work. A precise description of
our study and experimental protocol were submitted to and
approved for exemption by our university’s IRB. Moreover,
apart from only collecting publicly available data offered by
the ofﬁcial Twitter API, all usernames were removed during
the manual annotation process. This ensured that we would
not be able to identify/deanonymize any users. At the same
time, all collected data and results from our analysis were
stored on machines with up-to-date software, encrypted hard
drives, where access was strictly limited to the authors and
only possible from two white-listed internal IP addresses using
authorized SSH keys. We believe that our research presents
minimal risk while having the potential for signiﬁcant beneﬁts
to users; we have submitted a report to Twitter outlining our
ﬁndings and substantiating the need to purge this historical
data. We also deleted all the results of our analysis, the ground
truth dataset, and the entirety of the collected Twitter data, to
eliminate any potential of future privacy risks to the users.
VII. RELATED WORK
Prior work has proposed approaches for identifying home
and work locations that range from inspecting social graphs,
to studying check-ins and precise geolocation data (a survey
can be found in [74]). As certain users do not geotag their
tweets, previous work has also tried to infer home locations
based on tweet content [18], [46], [63] or other information like
social ties [33], [17] or check-in behavior [40]. However, these
studies only infer key locations at a very coarse granularity.
Furthermore, the inference of sensitive information from other
location data points has not been explored.
Location inference. In a study investigating mobility pat-
terns, Cho et al. [20] considered geographic cells of 625km2,
and considered a home location to be the average position
of the cell with the most check-ins. Pontes et al. [56] used
Foursquare check-ins and correctly inferred the home city of
∼78% of users. By considering that users are located at their
home at night and near their ofﬁce during working hours,
Liu et al. [44] identiﬁed the key locations of 68% of users
within a distance of 2.5 km. Efstathiades et al. [25] followed
a similar approach for detecting users’ home and work at
a postcode granularity using three Twitter datasets from the
Netherlands, London, and the Los Angeles county. Given that
the average size of a postal code area in LA is approximately
14.66km2 and includes over 37K residents (based on data
from [21]), it is evident that postcode-level granularity is still
very coarse. While our approach for detecting key locations is
based on spatiotemporal analysis, similarly to prior work, we
are the ﬁrst to propose an approach that considers the vertical
“widespreadness” of user activity for detecting homes, as well
as a dynamic and adaptive approach for detecting workplaces.
Apart from LPAuditor outperforming previously proposed
techniques (as shown in Section V), our experimental evalua-
tion and comparative study was conducted on a ground truth
dataset that is signiﬁcantly more complete and ﬁne-grained
than the datasets used in prior studies. In detail, the ground
