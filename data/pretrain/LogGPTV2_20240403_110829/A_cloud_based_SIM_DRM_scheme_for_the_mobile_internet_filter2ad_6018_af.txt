which reduces the Total. The last point of Total in Figure 11
ﬁts well with the prediction.
In the private cloud, as shown in Figure 12, both Total
and Average increase proportionally to the number of
simultaneous users. It means that our private cloud does not
do well in the distributed computing, which can be improved
in the future. When there are 500 simultaneous requests,
the license server reaches a limitation of the resources of the
private cloud. It has to slow down and wait for new resources
to deal with rest requests. However, the total running time
of license service on GAE is much longer than that on the

private cloud when the number of simultaneous users is
the same. The main reason for this situation is the network
latency of GAE which is the main factor inﬂuencing the
performance of license service in the public cloud. The
results of the next experiment just explain it well.
In order to investigate factors inﬂuencing the perfor-
mance, we analyze the response time of subprotocols of
LAP according to Server-Time and Network-Time, where
Server-Time is the response time for dealing with user

requests and generating responses in the license service,
and Network-Time is the network latency of the message
transmission. Here we ﬁx the number of simultaneous users.
The simultaneous number of GAE is 20, and that of the
private cloud is 100. The results of two experiments are
shown in Figures 13 and 14. Obviously, the network latency
is the main factor inﬂuencing the performance of cloud.
The diﬀerences on Server-Time between GAE and the private
cloud are not too much, which means that the eﬃciency can
be satisﬁed by both the private and public clouds. Comparing
with each subprotocol, the trigger subprotocol needs the
longest Server-Time. In this subprotocol, the cloud analyzes
the requests, generates, and stores usage rights with a large
number of data operations for the corresponding licenses.
The upload subprotocol takes more time on network due
to uploading licenses and LSW. The other subprotocols do
not involve so much data operations; therefore, they take less
Server-Time.
From the analysis of the experiments on subprotocols of
LAP both in the private and the public clouds (see Figures
13 and 14), we conclude that, for the public cloud, Server-
Time changes a little, while Network-Time becomes the main
factor for GAE to provide high quality services. Since that,
we argue that there are some optimization opportunities for
reducing Network-Time in the public cloud, such as XML
compression. We can encode the license and transfer the
messages, which are both in the XML format, into binary
code. These binary encoded streams are used for delivery
between a client and a backend. However, the encoding and
decoding process may take more computational cost.
We show the relationship between the response time
of LAP including its subprotocols and the number of
simultaneous users. The results are shown in Figures 15 and
16. The response time of each LAP subprotocol increases
with the increasing of the number of simultaneous users in
the private cloud. Moreover, the response time of the trigger
subprotocol and that of the upload subprotocol increase
faster than those of the other two subprotocols in public
cloud.
8. Related Work
Digital Rights Management is an active area of research with
a lot of prior works. Device-based DRM schemes and smart
card based DRM schemes are two main categories for the
existing DRM schemes. OMA DRM [1] and Microsoft DRM
[2] are device-based DRM schemes which have a common
problem—inﬂexibility. In order to solve this problem, smart
card-based DRM schemes are proposed [4–6].
A signiﬁcant portion of research on DRM systems is the
mobile DRM which has some special features such as the
wireless environment and the constraints on computation as
well as storage. The OMA completes an open standard for
mobile DRM. But it is still not detailed enough. Comparing
with the present situation of the usage of SIM card in the
DRM scheme, we design the whole scheme based on a SIM
card, including a set of algorithms and protocols. However,
OMA has standardized the usage of a SIM card in the DRM
18
EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking
system in its last document of DRM speciﬁcation. In the
speciﬁcation, a SIM card is only used to bind Rights Objects
(RO) with user identity. Considering the authority of OMA,
both the scientiﬁc research and engineering practice on the
SIM card-based DRM should pay close attention to the
OMA DRM speciﬁcation in the future. Smart card-based
DRM systems are more suitable for the mobile environment.
However, there are security issues, such as imposter attacks
[4, 5], in some existing smart card-based DRM schemes.
Although some solutions (e.g., [6]) are proposed to solve
these security issues, the complexity and cost of the system
dramatically increase.
Reference [17] is a relevant prior work about the SIM
card. It proposes a TMP-based DRM system which combines
the trust mobile platform (TMP) and OMA DRM. The TMP-
based DRM introduces SIM card to the DRM scheme, but
the usage of SIM card is very limited. The SIM card is just
for the authentication in [17], such as the conﬁrmation
of the user identity for TMP, network as well as Rights
Issuer (RI). Moreover, the concrete authentication steps
and authentication algorithms are not mentioned anymore.
The security issue about the communication between TMP
and SIM card is also ignored. Reference [25] is another
relevant work on the multimedia content distribution on the
mobile phone. It introduces smart card in the DRM scheme.
Meanwhile, watermarking is applied to detect piracy in the
network. Reference [26] applies a smart card to the condition
access system and designs a communication method and the
interface between a set-top box and a smart card. Reference
[27] designs a fair exchange protocol for trading electronic
rights to claim goods and services. Reference [28] proposes
a smart card-based digital content protection scheme for the
workﬂow and implements the system.
There are also some related works on the performance
issue of mobile DRM schemes. References [29, 30] are
two schemes on how to improve the performance of
OMA DRM scheme. The device identiﬁer is introduced
to the OMA DRM in [29]. The RI server encrypts RO
by using the symmetric encryption instead of asymmetric
encryption. The device identiﬁer is the symmetric key for
the symmetric encryption. However, the device identiﬁer has
to be transmitted by asymmetric encryption using public
key of RI. Since that, this scheme not only lacks ﬂexibility,
like device-based DRM system, but also increases the cost
and complexity by transmitting the device identiﬁer to
RI. Reference [30] improves the performance of the RO
generation algorithm by reducing generation and usage
times of the random number. However, the performance
improvement is very limited.
9. Conclusions
This paper presented a new DRM scheme—CS-DRM which
is a cloud-based SIM DRM scheme for the mobile Internet.
CS-DRM introduces a SIM card and cloud computing to
save the cost and provide higher security. Meanwhile, a pro-
totype of CS-DRM called Phosphor has been implemented.
Furthermore, our experimental results on the performance
of CS-DRM show that CS-DRM can satisfy performance
requirements of users well. All of these demonstrate that
CS-DRM is low cost, high eﬃcient, secure, and practicable.
However, there are still some optimization opportunities for
CS-DRM, such as XML compression, which are our future
works.
