### Optimized Text

**Introduction and Context:**
The provided text discusses the performance of a cloud-based digital rights management (DRM) system, specifically focusing on the response times in both private and public cloud environments. The analysis includes the impact of server-time and network-time on the total response time, as well as the behavior of the system under varying numbers of simultaneous users.

**Performance Analysis:**

1. **Total Response Time:**
   - In Figure 11, the last point of the total response time fits well with the prediction.
   - In the private cloud (Figure 12), both the total and average response times increase proportionally with the number of simultaneous users. This indicates that the private cloud's distributed computing capabilities need improvement.
   - When there are 500 simultaneous requests, the license server in the private cloud reaches its resource limits, leading to a slowdown and the need for additional resources to handle the remaining requests.
   - The total running time of the license service on Google App Engine (GAE) is significantly longer than in the private cloud, primarily due to the higher network latency in the public cloud.

2. **Subprotocol Analysis:**
   - To investigate the factors influencing performance, the response times of the subprotocols of the License Acquisition Protocol (LAP) were analyzed based on Server-Time and Network-Time.
   - Server-Time refers to the time taken by the server to process user requests and generate responses, while Network-Time refers to the network latency of message transmission.
   - The number of simultaneous users was fixed at 20 for GAE and 100 for the private cloud (Figures 13 and 14).
   - The network latency is the primary factor affecting the performance in the public cloud. The differences in Server-Time between GAE and the private cloud are minimal, indicating that both clouds can provide efficient services.
   - Among the subprotocols, the trigger subprotocol requires the most Server-Time due to the extensive data operations involved in analyzing requests, generating, and storing usage rights.
   - The upload subprotocol takes more time on the network due to the transfer of licenses and LSW, while other subprotocols have fewer data operations and thus require less Server-Time.

3. **Response Time and Simultaneous Users:**
   - Figures 15 and 16 show the relationship between the response time of LAP and the number of simultaneous users.
   - In the private cloud, the response time of each LAP subprotocol increases with the number of simultaneous users.
   - In the public cloud, the response time of the trigger and upload subprotocols increases more rapidly compared to the other subprotocols.

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- There are opportunities to optimize the public cloud's performance by reducing Network-Time, such as through XML compression. Encoding the license and messages into binary code can reduce the size of the transmitted data, but this may increase computational costs.

**Related Work:**
- Digital Rights Management (DRM) is an active research area with many prior works. Device-based DRM schemes (e.g., OMA DRM, Microsoft DRM) and smart card-based DRM schemes are two main categories.
- Mobile DRM systems, which operate in wireless environments with constraints on computation and storage, are a significant focus. The OMA standard for mobile DRM is not detailed enough, and existing smart card-based DRM schemes face security issues.
- Relevant prior works include TMP-based DRM systems, multimedia content distribution on mobile phones, and fair exchange protocols for trading electronic rights.

**Conclusions:**
- This paper introduces CS-DRM, a cloud-based SIM DRM scheme for the mobile internet. CS-DRM uses a SIM card and cloud computing to enhance security and reduce costs.
- A prototype called Phosphor has been implemented, and experimental results show that CS-DRM meets performance requirements.
- Future work includes further optimizations, such as XML compression.
