The Metrics Server is a critical component in Kubernetes that monitors and reports on the resource consumption within the cluster. It provides detailed metrics, which can be accessed using the `kubectl top nodes` command to view the current status of nodes. Additionally, it supplies the necessary data for [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)](kubernetes_hpa.md), enabling automatic scaling of deployments based on resource usage.

### Installation

To install the Metrics Server, you can use the official Helm chart available at the [Helm repository](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/metrics-server). For more information on Helm, refer to the [Helm documentation](helm.md).

### Testing Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

To verify that the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is functioning correctly, you can follow the [AWS EKS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.html) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

This guide will help you set up and test HPA to ensure that your applications scale appropriately based on the metrics provided by the Metrics Server.
