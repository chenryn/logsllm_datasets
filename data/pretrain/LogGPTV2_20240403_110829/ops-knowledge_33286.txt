Question: A developer has signed an APK with APK Signature Scheme v2 and is wondering how this will affect the installation on different versions of Android. Assuming the APK is also signed with the JAR signature scheme, how will Android platforms of different versions verify the APK?
"A": "Android 7.0 and later will verify the APK using both APK Signature Scheme v2+ and JAR signing, while older platforms will only verify the JAR signature.",
"B": "All Android versions will verify the APK using APK Signature Scheme v2 due to its backward compatibility with older signature schemes.",
"C": "Android 7.0 and later will ignore the v2 signature and only verify the APK using JAR signing, while older platforms will verify both signatures.",
"D": "Android 7.0 and later will verify the APK using APK Signature Scheme v2+, while older platforms will ignore v2 signatures and only verify JAR signing."
Answer: D
