Blue & Red
One of my favorite kid’s movies ever. Great quote that applies to defense and oﬀense
1. preface with that all I’m bringing up has been engineered and ﬁxed or I wouldn’t bring it up.
2.Imagine yourself walking into this environment with no help (at ﬁrst)
3.Hadn’t started in infosec yet
4.Knew these were bad, and it got worse
5.Guy didn’t grow with the environment
6.Started out with everyone in the dept as a domain admin and non-dept people knowing “INFO”
7.Start with some things we didn’t have
1.
A/V - production servers had anti-virus installed sometimes. But if it were to cause performance problems it would be uninstalled or disabled. Servers that were required to remain logged in with domain admin due to the way 
the application interacted with the desktop.
2.
WSUS. All windows environment. WSUS was there, just not really operational or managed.
3.
Visibility. No clue what software, how many servers/switches/pcs. What vendor equipment was on our network, what data was passing over it.
4.
decent datacenter (waterlines above, open ports, door access, cable mgmt)
pictures of server racks here
1.
backups
2. DMZ
3. segmentation, open ports and vlan1 everywhere!
4. At one point this was so incredibly bad. That our public facing web server was on a dual homed windows 2003 server. This Windows server had a database backend 
that our third party web developers would access with vnc. The database was on microsoft sql 2000 located on our domain controller. These same domain controllers 
contained the dhcp zones for our publicly accessible non-password protected, unencrypted wiﬁ. Once we had an issue with our guest wiﬁ and had an older lady call 
us up at the helpdesk asking when her internet would be back up and functional. She was located across the street.

Cath Lab
diagnostic imaging equipment used to visualize 
the arteries and chambers of the heart
1.
Lots of big named vendors supply cath lab equipment.
2. One night we ended up with our night operator calling about rapidly locked out accounts
3. Due to lack of visibility we made a quick vbs script to unlock
4. Turns out this vendor shipped us boxes infected with conﬁcker.
5. Scan everything before it hits your production network.
6. Turns out you get an amazing discount on your software licensing and hardware when you can prove a billion dollar company infected your network!
7. onto things that we did have
1.
ms08-067
2. conﬁcker
3. windows 2000/xp rampant
1.
Password protected excel 2002 with all of our organizational passwords
2. Water spouts (literally)
3. no password policies/password reuse constantly/no password on sa
1.
Best alerting system ever = APC UPS
2. Phone system for our switch board that could be taken down by a port scan.
3. bedside usb card readers that used keyboard emulation to type in credit card data
4. Pharmacy tablet sending PCI data wirelessly in the clear.

Blue Team contractor
I kid you not this is what he did all day. Ask @z0rlac and he can back me up.
We provided internet connections for multiple oﬀsite locations as well as allowed them to colocate in our datacenter, oﬀered them services, as well as applications. After I 
had purchased a vulnerability scanner and shown them what shodan could do I was then instructed to run vulnerability scans across our connections with the businesses 
just as an added bonus to them.

I have another talk about this entire purple team exercise that grew into a security awareness program. I go into this program in detail in the talk, however about half way 
through I decided to use a fake Paypal/Kohl’s receipt as a phish for click baiting. I inadvertently had a user cancel her paypal and Kohl’s card and open up fraud cases 
with their support. Before she even realized that it came from a google address to her work email that wasn’t even tied back to her personal account.

Also the talk is on irongeek’s site/youtube channel and a link on my blog. It’s called “Shooting Phish in a Barrel and other bad puns”
