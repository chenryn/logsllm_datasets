## Introduction
Frequent flyer miles are nice, but having a higher status is even better. However, sometimes these improvements don’t work as expected. This presentation will explore the vulnerabilities in boarding pass systems and how they can be exploited.

## IATA Resolution 792
IATA Resolution 792 outlines various formats for bar-coded boarding passes:
- Paper
- PDF417
- Mobile
- QR Code
- Aztec
- DataMatrix

### Example Bar-Coded Boarding Pass
```
M1JAROSZEWSKI/PRZEMYSLE56XXXX WAWCPHSK 2762 666M009C0007 666>10B0 K6161BSK 2511799999153830 SK A3 199999999 *3000500A3G
```

## Exploiting Boarding Passes
### Free Fast Track for All Travelers
By manipulating the boarding pass, it is possible to gain free access to fast track services for all travelers. For example:
```
M1COLUMBUS/CHRISTOPHERE56YYYY WAWCPHSK 2762 666M009C0007 666>10B0 K6161BSK 2511799999153830 SK A3 199999999 *3000500A3G
```

### Historical Context
- **Bruce Schneier (2003):** "Flying On Someone Else’s Airplane Ticket"
- **Andy Bowers (2005):** "A Dangerous Loophole in Airport Security"
- **Bruce Schneier (2006):** "The Boarding Pass Brouhaha"
- **Christopher Soghoian (2007):** "Insecure Flight: Broken Boarding Passes and Ineffective Terrorist Watch Lists"
- **Jeffrey Goldberg (2008):** "The Things He Carried"
- **Charles C. Mann (2011):** "Smoke Screening"

### No Fly List Bypass (2006)
1. Buy tickets under a false name.
2. Print the boarding pass at home.
3. Create a copy of the boarding pass with your real name.
4. Present the fake boarding pass and real ID to TSA officers.
5. Present the real boarding pass to gate agents.
6. Fly.

### No Fly List Bypass (2016 Europe)
1. Buy tickets under a false name.
2. Print the boarding pass at home.
3. Fly.

### Factors Affecting Success
- **Airline Business Consciousness:** Some airlines may be more aware and responsive to such issues.
- **Temporary Security Checks:** Additional checks can disrupt the process.

## Passenger Data Storage
### Computer Reservation Systems (CRS)
- **Function:** Store and process Passenger Name Records (PNR) containing personal data, reservations, issued tickets, special requests, and loyalty program data.
- **Examples:** Sabre, Amadeus, Galileo, Worldspan, and proprietary systems.
- **Data Access:** Limited across different CRSs and parties.

### Other Systems
- **Departure Control System (DCS):** Handles check-in information.
- **Advance Passenger Information (API):** Provides data to border agencies.
- **PNRGOV:** Shares data with government agencies.
- **Secure Flight:** Matches passenger data against watch lists.

## Manipulating Paper and Digital Boarding Passes
### Paper Boarding Passes
- **Editing Tools:** MS Word can be used to edit PDFs.
- **Barcode Scanning:** The barcode must reflect the printed information.

### Lounge Access
- **Contract Lounges:** No way to verify eligibility; may require an invitation from the airline.
- **Airline-Operated Lounges:** May have access to passenger records but only for their own passengers. Automatic gates are increasingly popular.

### Duty-Free Goods
- **Eligibility:** Based on destination (e.g., EU/Non-EU).
- **Benefits:** Free Fast Track, free lunch and drinks, and duty-free shopping for all.

## Digital Signatures and XML
### Digital Signatures
- **Implementation:** In 2008, IATA extended the BCBP standard to include digital signatures based on PKI.
- **Usage:** Optional, determined by local security administration.
- **Keys:** Private keys owned by airlines, public keys distributed to third parties.
- **Enforcement:** TSA enforces this for US carriers.

### BCBP XML
- **Proposal:** In 2008, IATA proposed the use of PADIS XML for exchanging BCBP data between airlines and third parties.
- **Process:** The terminal sends a message with a header and full BCBP content, and the airline replies with a Yes/No, along with a reason and optional free text.

## Secure Flight Program
- **Purpose:** Matches passenger data against watch lists.
- **Data Shared:**
  - Full name
  - Gender
  - Date of birth
  - Screening status
  - Reservation number
  - Flight itinerary

## Is It a Vulnerability?
### Responses from Authorities
- **LOT Polish Airlines:** Directed to Warsaw Airport for boarding pass scanning systems.
- **Warsaw Airport:** Acknowledged the issue but stated compliance with CAA guidelines.
- **Civil Aviation Authority for Poland:** Boarding pass forgery is a crime.
- **Turkish Airlines:** Contacted related units for further action.
- **SAS:** Appreciated the feedback for service improvement.
- **TSA:** No response.

## Conclusion
- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Boarding pass forgery is illegal and should not be attempted.
- **Souvenir Potential:** While not advisable, understanding the system can be interesting.
