No Fly List Bypass (in 2006)
• Buy tickets under false name
• Print your boarding pass at home
• Create a copy of the boarding pass with your real name
• Present the fake boarding pass and the real ID to TSA officers
• Present the real boarding pass to gate agents
• Fly
No Fly List Bypass (in 2016 Europe)
• Buy tickets under false name
• Print your boarding pass at home
• Fly
Impacting factors:
• Particular airline’s business consciousness
• Temporary security checks
So… Where is passenger data stored?
• Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) allow for storage and processing of 
Passenger Name Records (PNR) containing:
• personal data (names, contact details)
• reservations (airlines, hotels, cars, …)
• issued tickets
• special requests
• loyalty programs data
• Dozens of CRSs exist
• GDS (eg. Sabre, Amadeus, Galileo, Worldspan, …)
• proprietary ones
• One reservation may result with multiple PNRs in different CRSs
• Data access is limited not only across CRSs, but across different parties
… and then on to other systems
• Departure Control System (DCS) – check-in info
• Advance Passenger Information (API) – to border agencies
• PNRGOV – to government agencies
• Secure Flight

Paper is just a bit less fun…
• MS Word is a great PDF-editing tool 
• Most likely barcode will be scanned
anyway, so it needs to reflect the printed
information
Lounge access
• Contract lounges
• no way to verify eligibility
• may require an invitation issued from the airline
at check-in
• Airline-operated lounges
• may have access to passenger records …
• … but only for own passengers!
• automatic gates increasingly popular (eg. SAS 
lounges in CPH, OSL; Turkish lounge in IST)
Show time!
Duty Free Goods
• In many countries goods
are sold directly to the 
passenger (liquors sealed in 
a plastic bag)
• Eligibility is determined
based on destination
(eg. EU/Non-EU)
Where did we get?
• Free Fast Track for all
• Free lunch and booze for all
• Duty free shopping for all
Digital Signature
• In 2008 IATA extended BCBP standard with support for digital
signatures based on PKI
• The field is "optional and to be used only when required by the local 
security administration"
• The field has variable length, with specific algorithm etc. determined
by the authority
• Private keys owned by airlines, public keys distributed to third parties
• TSA enforced for US carriers
BCBP XML
• In 2008 IATA proposed Passenger and Airport Data Interchange
Standards (PADIS) XML to be used for exchange of BCBP data 
between airlines and third parties, such as lounges or security
checkpoints
• The terminal would send a message consisting of a header and full
BCBP content
• The airline would reply with a Yes/No, along with a reason and 
optional free text

Secure Flight
• Program implemented by TSA in 2009 to match passenger data 
against watch lists such as No Fly List and Selectee List 
• In 2013 TSA started networking CAT/BPSS devices to pull passenger
data from Secure Flight, including:
• Passenger’s full name
• Gender
• Date of birth
• Screening status
• Reservation number
• Flight itinerary (in order to determine which airports receive data)
Is it a vulnerability?
• LOT Polish Airlines:
- Please contact Warsaw Airport about this issue as they’re responsible for 
boarding pass scanning systems.
• Warsaw Airport:
- It’s a known issue, but not a problem. We’re compliant with all CAA 
guidelines.
• Civil Aviation Authority for Poland:
- Boarding pass forgery is a crime since they are documents.
• Me:
- Can you have a legally binding document without any form of 
authentication?
• Civil Aviation Authority for Poland:
- Oh, go f*** yourself!
Is it a vulnerability?
• Turkish Airlines:
- Please be inform that, we have already shared your contact details 
with our related unit, to get in touch with you as soon as possible.
• SAS:
- We appreciate that you have taken the time to send us your 
feedback, as this is crucial for us to improve our services.
• TSA:
awkward silence
Will it fly?
•NO.
•Seriously. Don’t try!
But you can have a nice souvenir
