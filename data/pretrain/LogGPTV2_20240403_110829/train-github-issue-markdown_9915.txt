This will set the `dashCase` class on the button to true or false depending
upon the value of `binding`.
I know dash-case to camelCase conversion is actually a "feature" built into
the attribute parser, but it should have exceptions in cases like this.
The last thing I would expect is for angular to camel my classNames.
