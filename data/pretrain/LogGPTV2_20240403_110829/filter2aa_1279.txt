What is DDoS 
§  A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one in which a multitude of 
compromised systems attack a single target, thereby causing denial of service 
for users of the targeted system.  
§  The flood of incoming messages to the target system essentially forces it to shut 
down, thereby denying service to the system to legitimate users.

DDoS - Yesterday 
2002 root DNS attack 
All thirteen (13) DNS root name servers were targeted simultaneously. 
Attack volume was approximately 50 to 100 Mbits/sec (100 to 200 Kpkts/
sec) per root name server, yielding a total attack volume was 
approximately 900 Mbits/sec (1.8 Mpkts/sec). 
Attack traffic contained ICMP, TCP SYN, fragmented TCP, and UDP. 
Some attack types you might heard of 
ICMP flood, Ping flood, UDP flood, IP Fragment, SYN 
flood, Teardrop, ACK flood, RST flood, Land attack, 
smurf attack, Ping to death, Nuke, ARP Poison, 
Reflex attack, TCP NULL, XMAS, Malformed TCP 
flags, PUSH ACK flood, DNS query flood, GET flood, 
POST flood,  authentication flood, de-authentication 
flood, SIP flood
