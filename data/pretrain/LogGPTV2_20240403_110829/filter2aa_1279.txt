## About Us
Nexusguard, established in 2008, is a leading provider of end-to-end, cloud-based Internet Security Solutions. Our mission is to ensure uninterrupted web service delivery for our clients by protecting them against the ever-increasing and evolving array of internet threats, particularly Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and other attacks targeting web application software.

## What is DDoS?
A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack involves multiple compromised systems attacking a single target, overwhelming it with traffic and causing denial of service for legitimate users. The flood of incoming messages forces the target system to shut down, denying access to legitimate users.

## Types of DDoS Attacks
1. **Zombies on Innocent Computers**
2. **Server-level DDoS Attacks** (Protocol / Application)
3. **Infrastructure-level DDoS Attacks**
4. **Bandwidth-level DDoS Attacks**

## DDoS vs. Hacking
| DDoS | Hacking |
|------|---------|
| If (Available) { <br> try { <br> SQLi, XSS, CSRF, MITM, Brute Force, Reverse Engineering, Buffer Overflow, RFI, Session Hijacking, Information Leakage, Defacement, something cool <br> } catch (data) <br> finally { DDoS } <br>} | while (Available) { <br> try { <br> DDoS() <br> } finally { <br> Give_up() <br>} |

## Trend of DDoS Attacks
- **POC (Proof of Concept)**
- **Organized**
- **Collaborated**
- **Volume**
- **Focus**
- **0-day focus**

### 2008 - 2009
- **DJB33X**: 100+ Gbps / 70 Mpps

## DDoS - Brief History
### 2002 Root DNS Attack
- **Target**: All thirteen (13) DNS root name servers.
- **Attack Volume**: Approximately 50 to 100 Mbits/sec (100 to 200 Kpkts/sec) per server, totaling around 900 Mbits/sec (1.8 Mpkts/sec).
- **Traffic Types**: ICMP, TCP SYN, fragmented TCP, and UDP.

### Common Attack Types
- ICMP Flood, Ping Flood, UDP Flood, IP Fragment, SYN Flood, Teardrop, ACK Flood, RST Flood, Land Attack, Smurf Attack, Ping to Death, Nuke, ARP Poison, Reflex Attack, TCP NULL, XMAS, Malformed TCP Flags, PUSH ACK Flood, DNS Query Flood, GET Flood, POST Flood, Authentication Flood, De-authentication Flood, SIP Flood

---

## Tools and Libraries
### Built-in Tools
- Ping, Telnet, Wget

### Easily Accessible Tools
- hping, Scapy, cURL

### Libraries
- Libpcap-dev, libthread, libnet-dev, netinet/*.h, string.h

---

## DDoS in the Cloud Era
### Case Studies
- **Netflix**
  - **Cost Savings**: Over $500K/year with Amazon S3 Storage
  - **Brand Building**: Google Maps saw 300% growth vs. 20% for MapQuest
  - **Cloud Migration**: Over 50% of all transactions via their API, Force.com
  - **Accessibility**: Now available on over 200 devices

## API Abused DDoS
### API Security Threats
- API Key Spoofing
- API Throttling Bypass
- Quota System Bypass
- API ACL (Private API accessed by Public)

### API Request DDoS
- HTTP/HTTPS GET Flood
- HTTP/HTTPS POST Flood
- PUT/DELETE/HEAD?

### What if it’s not abuse?

## 100,000 Users Have Downloaded Malware from Google Play
### Google/Alternative Android Markets and the Audit Policy

---

## Mobile Device Botnets—Existing Apps

---

## Android DDoS Tool
- **Requirements**:
  - Internet Access: To send HTTP POST data
  - Phone State: To access the IMEI
  - These are common requirements for many apps.

## Next Generation Detection—Profiling and Data Mining
### Traffic Baseline
- HTTP Field Pattern
- HTTP Traffic Volume
- TCP Connections

### IP Ranking
- Geo IP
- 80/20 Rule
- Open API Data Comparison (e.g., Google Safe Browsing API, Seculert API)
