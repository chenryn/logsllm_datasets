User: Does anyone know how I would go about detected what bit version Windows is under Python.  I need to know this as a way of using the right folder for Program Files.
Many thanks
Assistant: Many of these proposed solutions, such as platform.architecture(), fail because their results depend on whether you are running 32-bit or 64-bit Python.
The only reliable method I have found is to check for the existence of os.environ['PROGRAMFILES(X86)'], which is unfortunately hackish.
