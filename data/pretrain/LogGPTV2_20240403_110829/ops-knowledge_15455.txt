**Subject: Determining Windows Bit Version in Python**

Hello,

I need to determine the bit version of the Windows operating system using Python. This is necessary to ensure that I use the correct "Program Files" directory.

Many thanks for any assistance.

**Response:**

Several proposed solutions, such as `platform.architecture()`, are unreliable because their results depend on whether you are running 32-bit or 64-bit Python.

The most reliable method I have found is to check for the existence of the `os.environ['PROGRAMFILES(X86)']` environment variable. However, this approach feels somewhat hackish.

If anyone has a more elegant solution, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
