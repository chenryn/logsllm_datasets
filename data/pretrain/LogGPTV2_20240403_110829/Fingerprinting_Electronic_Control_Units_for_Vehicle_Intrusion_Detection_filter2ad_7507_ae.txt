5.3 Defending Against Masquerade Attack
We now evaluate the performance of CIDS in detecting a
masquerade attack.
CAN bus prototype. To evaluate CIDS’s defense
against the masquerade attack in the CAN bus prototype,
nodes A and B were considered to have been compro-
mised as strong and weak attackers as in Fig. 2(c), re-
spectively. A was programmed to mount a masquerade
attack on B, i.e., stop B transmitting message 0x55 and
instead send it through A onwards, once Tmasq = 250 secs
had elapsed. As usual, messages 0x11 and 0x13 were pe-
riodically sent by A, and CIDS was run by R.
Fig. 8(a) (left) shows the Probability Mass Function
(PMF) of the intervals of message 0x55: before and af-
ter the attack was mounted. In contrast to the fabrica-
tion attack, since the attacker sent the attack message at
its original frequency after masquerading, the distribu-
tion did not deviate much from that before the attack.
However, at Tmasq, since there was some delay when the
transmitter was switched from one node to another, the
ﬁrst masquerade attack message was sent 51.04ms after
its previous transmission, whereas it should have been
approximately 50ms which is the preset message interval
of 0x55. Due to such a slightly mistimed masquerade at-
tack, the PMF graph shows a message interval with an
abnormal deviation from the mean. We will later eval-
uate the perfectly timed masquerade attack — a much
more severe case than a mistimed attack — on a real ve-
hicle, and show the efﬁcacy of CIDS in detecting it.
The resulting changes in Oacc, L+, and L− at R are
also shown in Fig. 8(a) (middle and right). The change
in the ECU transmitting message 0x55 caused the slope
(i.e., clock skew) in Oacc graph to change after the at-
tack was mounted. Since the measurements of Oacc af-
ter Tmasq signiﬁcantly deviated from their expected val-
ues, which is determined by the estimated clock skew of
t  Tmasq, i.e., the transmitter of 0x1B0
changes from V2 to V1. Such a change in interpretation
was achieved by programming R to modify its message
acceptance ﬁlter from only accepting 0x1B0 to only ac-
cepting 0x1A6. Since 0x1B0 and 0x1A6 were observed
to be always transmitted nearly at the same time, such a

Figure 10: Defense against the worst-case masquerade attack via message-pairwise detection.
setting replicates the timed masquerade attack. During
such a process, B continuously logged 0x1B0 so that we
can obtain a reference for circumstances when no attacks
are mounted.
Fig. 8(b) (left) shows the PMF of the message inter-
vals of 0x1B0 before and after the attack. Since the mes-
sage periodicity remained the same, the distribution of
the messages intervals did not change. Moreover, since
we considered a timed masquerade attack, in contrast to
the result in Fig. 8(a), there were no such abnormal mes-
sage intervals. Such a result indicates that state-of-the-
art IDSs, which try to ﬁnd abnormal message frequen-
cies, cannot detect such an attack. Although the distri-
bution of message intervals remained unchanged, due to
the change in ECU transmitting 0x1B0 (V2 → V1), the
accumulated clock offset suddenly exhibited a different
trend in its change, i.e., a different clock skew after the
attack. Here, the original trend in offset changes was de-
termined by the data obtained from B. So, as shown in
Fig. 8(b) (right), CIDS was able to detect a sudden shift in
its identiﬁcation error and thus outputted a high level of
CUSUM upper control limit, i.e., an intrusion detection.
CIDS’s capability of detecting various types of masquer-
ade attack is evaluated further in Section 5.5.
In conclusion, through its modeling and detection pro-
cesses, CIDS can detect not only the fabrication attack
but also the masquerade attack, i.e., is capable of doing
not only what existing solutions can do, but also more.
5.4 Message-pairwise Detection
We evaluate the feasibility and efﬁciency of message-
pairwise detection in CIDS. To validate its practicabil-
ity in the real-world, we ﬁrst examine whether there ex-
ists pairs of messages inside real vehicles with correlated
clock offsets — the condition for CIDS to run message-
pairwise detection.
Fig. 9(a) shows two cases of correlated and uncorre-
lated clock offsets of in-vehicle messages collected from
the Honda Accord 2013. Fig. 9(a) (left) shows that the
average clock offsets of messages 0x1B0 and 0x1D0,
which were determined to have been sent from the same
ECU, showed a high correlation of 0.9213, i.e., linear re-
lationship. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 9(a) (right), aver-
age clock offsets of messages 0x1B0 and 0x1A6, which
