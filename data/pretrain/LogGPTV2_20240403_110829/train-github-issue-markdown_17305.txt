Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-remove-classes-from-
an-element-with-jquery has an issue.  
Please describe how to reproduce it, and include links to screenshots if
possible.
If you just type this:  
$("button").removeClass();  
without the "btn-default" as a parameter for the removeClass function, the "Go
to my next challenge" already gets enabled.
