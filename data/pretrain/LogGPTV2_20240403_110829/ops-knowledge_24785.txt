User: The strength of Twisted (for python) is its asynchronous framework (I think). I've written an image processing server that takes requests via Perspective Broker. It works great as long as I feed it less than a couple hundred images at a time. However, sometimes it gets spiked with hundreds of images at virtually the same time. Because it tries to process them all concurrently the server crashes.
As a solution I'd like to queue up the remote_calls on the server so that it only processes ~100 images at a time. It seems like this might be something that Twisted already does, but I can't seem to find it. Any ideas on how to start implementing this? A point in the right direction? Thanks!
Assistant: You might also like the txRDQ (Resizable Dispatch Queue) I wrote. Google it, it's in the tx collection on LaunchPad. Sorry I don't have more time to reply - about to go onstage.
