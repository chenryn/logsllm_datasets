### Description
Hi,
i upgraded babel to version 6 (from 5) and after editing .babelrc, im getting
error these codes:
With let:
    Duplicate declaration "foo" while parsing file
or with const:
    "foo" is read-only (This is an error on an internal node. Probably an internal error. Location has been estimated.) while parsing file:
babel-core, babel-preset-es2015, babel-preset-stage-0 installed
Im attaching test code, same error.
thanks in advance,  
John.
