User: The MySQL database responds too slowly during access peaks. How to improve performance by adjusting parameters and optimizing query statements?
Assistant: 1. Adjust parameters: - Adjust memory buffer size, including key_buffer_size, innodb_buffer_pool_size, sort_buffer_size, etc.; - Adjust thread pool size parameters, such as thread_cache_size, etc.; - Adjust connection timeout, etc.; - Adjust other parameters according to actual conditions, such as max_connections, innodb_log_file_size , innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit, etc. 2. Optimize the query statement: - Determine the optimal index; - Avoid full table scan, use index for query as much as possible; - Avoid using SELECT *, only query the required fields; - Avoid using subquery, use it when possible Join query; - Reasonably use pagination query; - Avoid fuzzy query with LIKE prefix, or use full-text index for like operation, etc. The above are some solutions to deal with the slow response of the MySQL database during access peaks. In practical applications, it is also necessary to adjust and optimize according to specific conditions to improve database performance.
