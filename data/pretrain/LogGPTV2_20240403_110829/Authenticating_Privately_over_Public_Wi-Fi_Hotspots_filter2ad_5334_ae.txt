average operation time for each server per database column
on a straightforward polynomial multiplication and addition
implementation.
GPU computations clearly outperform the threaded pro-
gram as can be expected, and also scale well on the number
of cores and devices. For the case of Server 6, a set of 8
mid-range GPUs (2300-core) could compute the response
of 10 million rows in little more than 1.1 seconds key table.
However, evaluation times still fall in the order of seconds
due to the nature of the O(cid:0)N 2(cid:1) multiplication algorithm
used.
In contrast, the Fast Fourier Transform strategy outlined
in Section 5.4 signiﬁcantly reduces the evaluation time per
column (over an order of magnitude gain). Figures 4a and 4b
show the average time taken per column multiplication and
addition over 500 samples using diﬀerent block/threading
conﬁgurations. Every curve represents a block conﬁguration
for the ﬁrst addition step, while the time shown includes
both addition steps. From our results we ﬁnd each device
has diﬀerent optimum block parameter (as described in Sec-
tion 5.4) with β = 64 for the Amazon instance and β = 96 for
the GTX780. The mid-range GTX780 device takes 1.077ms
per-column computation for the FFT multiplication and ad-
dition versus 28ms with the former implementation. This
implies an array of 8 GTX780 GPUs can compute the PIR
response of 10 million 326-bit wide entries in 43.9ms. The
improvement comes from increased parallelism during the
point-to-point product in the frequency domain, where the
result is dependent only on the two factor coeﬃcients.
Our results above give the time required of end-to-end
authentication using TracEdge by adding query transmission,
PIR computation, response transmission and query extrac-

a performance penalty for using these networks, their per-
formance has seen an upward trend, reaching 9Mbps per
relay average [57], making it comparable to our link through-
put wardriving experiment in Section 6. This suggests relay
anonymity networks are no longer a bottleneck.
