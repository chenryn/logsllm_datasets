ABSTRACT
Domain squatting is a common adversarial practice where attack-
ers register domain names that are purposefully similar to popular
domains. In this work, we study a specific type of domain squatting
called “combosquatting,” in which attackers register domains that
combine a popular trademark with one or more phrases (e.g., bet-
terfacebook[.]com, youtube-live[.]com). We perform the first large-
scale, empirical study of combosquatting by analyzing more than
468 billion DNS records—collected from passive and active DNS data
sources over almost six years. We find that almost 60% of abusive
combosquatting domains live for more than 1,000 days, and even
worse, we observe increased activity associated with combosquat-
ting year over year. Moreover, we show that combosquatting is
used to perform a spectrum of different types of abuse including
phishing, social engineering, affiliate abuse, trademark abuse, and
even advanced persistent threats. Our results suggest that com-
bosquatting is a real problem that requires increased scrutiny by
the security community.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Domain Name System (DNS) [63, 64], is a distributed hierar-
chical database that acts as the Internet’s phone book. DNS’s main
goal is the translation of human readable domains to IP addresses.
The reliability and agility that DNS offers has been fundamental
to the effort to scale information and business across the Internet.

Thus, it is not surprising that miscreants heavily rely on DNS to
scale their abusive operations.
In fact, domain squatting is a very common tactic used to facili-
tate abuse by registering domains that are confusingly similar [12]
to those belonging to large Internet brands. Past work has thor-
oughly investigated typosquatting (domain squatting via typograph-
ical errors) [13, 33, 48, 54, 67, 90], bit squatting (domain squatting via
accidental bit flips) [31, 68], homograph-based squatting (domains
that abuse characters from different character sets) [39, 44], and
homophone-based squatting (domains that abuse the pronunciation
similarity of different words) [69].
A type of domain squatting that has yet to be extensively studied
is that of “combosquatting.” Combosquatting refers to the combi-
nation of a recognizable brand name with other keywords (e.g.,
paypal-members[.]com and facebookfriends[.]com). While some
existing research uses other terms to describe combosquatting do-
mains (i.e.„ “cousin domains” [46]), this work only studies com-
bosquatting in the context of phishing abuse, failing to capture the
full spectrum of potential abuse. Thus, even though the general
concept of constructing these types of malicious domains is part
of the collective consciousness of security researchers, the commu-
nity lacks a large-scale, empirical study on combosquatting and
how it may be abused. Therefore, the security community has little
insight into which trademarks domain squatters commonly abuse,
how well existing blacklists capture such abuse, and which types
of abuse combosquatting is used for.
In this work, we conduct the first large-scale, longitudinal study
of combosquatting abuse to empirically measure its impact. By
combining more than 468 billion DNS records from both active and
passive DNS datasets, which span almost six years, we identify 2.7
million combosquatting domains that target 268 of the most popular
trademarks in the US, and we find that combosquatting domains
are 100 times more prevalent than typosquatting domains—despite
the fact that combosquatting has been less studied. Our study also
makes several key observations that help better characterize how
combosquatting is used for abuse.
First, we study the lexical characteristics of combosquatting do-
mains. We observe that combosquatting lacks generative models
and find that, while combosquatting domains vary in overall length,
Session C2:  World Wide Web of WickednessCCS’17, October 30-November 3, 2017, Dallas, TX, USA56950% add at most eight additional characters to the original trade-
mark being abused. Furthermore, 40% of combosquatting domains
are constructed by adding a single token (Section 4.2) to the origi-
nal trademark. Thus, while the pool of potential combosquatting
domains is very large, we find that many instances of combosquat-
ting try and limit the overall length of the combosquatting domain.
Additionally, we find that combosquatting domains tend to prefer
words that are closely related to the underlying business category
of the trademark—resulting in combinations that are more targeted
than random.
Second, we analyze the temporal properties of combosquatting
domains and, surprisingly, we see that almost 60% of the abusive
combosquatting domains can be found in our datasets for more than
1,000 days—suggesting that these abusive domains can often go
unremediated. When combosquatting domains do become known
to the security community, it is often significantly after the threat
was seen in the wild. For example, 20% of the abusive combosquat-
ting domains appear on a public blacklist almost 100 days after we
observe initial resolutions in our DNS datasets, and this number
goes up to 30% for combosquatting domains observed in malware
feeds. To make matters worse, we observe a growing number of
queries to combosquatting domains year over year, which is in
stark contrast to better known squatting techniques like typosquat-
ting. Thus, combosquatting appears to be an increasingly effective
technique used by Internet miscreants.
Third, we discover and analyze numerous instances of com-
bosquatting abuse in the real world. Through a substantial crawl-
ing and manual labeling effort, we discover that combosquatting
domains are used to perform many different types of abuse that
include phishing, social engineering, affiliate abuse, and trademark
abuse (i.e., capitalizing on the popularity of trademarks to sell their
own products and services). By analyzing publicly available threat
reports, we also identified 65 combosquatting domains that were
used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns. These find-
ings highlight the wide reaching impact of combosquatting abuse.
Finally, we manually analyzed various techniques attackers used to
drop malware and counter detection—leading to some interesting
discoveries surrounding the use of redirection chains and cookies.
In summary, combosquatting is a type of domain squatting that
has yet to be extensively studied by the research community. We
provide the first large-scale, empirical study to better understand
how attackers use combosquatting to perform a variety of abusive
behaviors. Our study examines the lexical characteristics, temporal
behavior, and real world abuse of combosquatting domains. We
find that not only does combosquatting abuse often appear to go
unremediated, but its popularity also appears to be on the rise.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we define combosquatting and discuss how it differs
from other types of DNS squatting. Additionally, we discuss how
combosquatting is used to facilitate many different types of abuse.
For example, Internet miscreants use combosquatting to perform
social engineering, drive-by-download attacks, malware communi-
cation, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) monetization. Thus,
even though combosquatting has not been extensively studied, it
has far reaching implications.
2.1 DNS Squatting & Combosquatting
Combosquatting refers to the attempt of “borrowing” a domain
name’s reputation (or brand name) characteristics by integrating a
brand domain with other characters or words. Combosquatting dif-
fers from other forms of domain name squatting, like typosquatting
and bitsquatting [70], in two fundamental ways: first, combosquat-
ting does not involve the spelling deviation from the original trade-
mark and second, it requires the original domain to be intact within
a set of other characters. In this paper, we consider a domain name
being combosquatting based on the following definition.
Given the effective second level domain name (e2LD) of a le-
gitimate trademark, a domain is considered combosquatting if the
following two conditions are met: (1) The domain contains the
trademark. (2) The domain cannot result by applying the five ty-
posquatting models of Wang et al. [90].
For example, lets consider the trademark Example, such that it is
served by the domain name example[.]com and the e2LD of which
is example. Combosquatting domain names, based on this e2LD,
could include any combination of valid characters in the Domain
Name System, whether they are prepended or appended to the e2LD.
For instance, secure-example[.]com, myexample[.]com, another-
coolexample-here[.]com are cases of combosquatting. However,
wwwexample[.]com and examplee[.]com are not, since they violate
the second clause mentioned earlier. Table 1 shows examples of
the different squatting attacks against the youtube[.]com domain
name.
2.2 Combosquatting Abuse
In this section, we discuss the most common types of combosquat-
ting abuse. Despite common beliefs, combosquatting domains are
not only used for trademark infringement but are also regularly
used in a wide variety of abusive activities—including drive-by
downloads, malware command-and-control, SEO, and phishing. We
should note that all cases mentioned next were reported to the
registrars and law enforcement for remediation.
2.2.1 Phishing. In generic phishing attacks, where obtaining
the user’s credentials is the final goal of the adversary, the attacker
would likely register combosquatting domains close to the targeted
organization. For example, in Figure 1a we can see one of those
phishing campaigns against Bank of America (BoA) users that em-
ployees the bankofamerica-com-login-sys-update-online[.]com do-
main. It is worth noting that the phishing page that was hosted on
this combosquatting domain was nearly identical to the actual BoA
website. We argue that this visual similarity, when coupled with

the bank’s brand name clearly embedded in the combosquatting
domain, makes it highly unlikely that everyday users of the web
would be able to detect this website as phishing.
2.2.2 Malware. Delivery of malware and drive-by attacks is
another interesting case of combosquatting abuse. For example, a
combosquatting domain can be used to redirect victims to a page
showing fake warnings to lure them into downloading malicious
software. Figure 1b shows the domain airbnbforbeginners[.]com
being used to lure new AirBnB users. Once users land on the page,
a Flash update request is shown to the end user in what looks like
a Windows dialogue prompt. Thus, the attack attempts to infect
the user by using alerts that suggest Flash Player is outdated and
then entice the user to download a malicious update.
In Table 2, we can see malware related domain names that were
used as Command and Control (C&C) points for botnets created
using popular malware kits (e.g., Zeus). While it is hard to know
for sure why attackers decide to use domains that contain popular
trademarks, such domains could evade manual analysis of malware
communications. The use of combosquatting domain names is not
limited to common malware families, like the ones in Table 2. As we
will see in Section 3.2, using public reports around targeted attacks
and Advance Persistent Threats (APTs), we identified more than 60
APT C&C domains that utilize combosquatting, abusing up to 12
different popular brand names.
2.2.3 Monetization. Next to malicious activities mentioned ear-
lier, combosquatting domains have been heavily exploited in trade-
mark infringement and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). In this

monetization category, the combosquatting domains often adver-
tise services similar or related to the original services and products
offered by the trademarks being abused. A real world example of
such a trademark infringing domain is presented in Figure 1c in
which the domain name victoriassecretoutlet[.]org abuses the Vic-
toria’s Secret trademark to offer likely counterfeit products at a
lower price.
3 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
Measuring the extent of the combosquatting problem is particularly
hard because of the almost unlimited pool of potential domains.
However, given the definition of combosquatting in Section 2.1,
we provide a methodical way to identify combosquatting domains
using various datasets. Additionally, we discuss our rationale for
selecting trademarks that are most likely to be abused, the type of
datasets we use throughout our study, and introduce the necessary
notation utilized from this point on.
3.1 Trademark Selection
While all trademarks could be the subject of combosquatting abuse,
it is arguably not in the best interest of an adversary to use a
less known brand for abuse. In our hypothesis we assume that
the adversary would include the trademark name in the effective
second level domain (e2LD) as a way to lure victims into clicking
and interacting with the combosquatting domain and site.
To that extent, we first need to identify the set of popular domains
that are used by major brands (likely to be abused by adversaries).
To assemble this list of domains, we extracted the top 500 domain
names in the United States (US) from Alexa [14]. Our decision to use
only the US-centric popular Alexa domains is due to the underlying
datasets we will use for our long-term study (which are mostly
US-centric), as we will see in the following section.
Now, even with the top 500 Alexa list, not all domains are appro-
priate candidates for our combosquatting analysis. This is because
(1) there are several brands that employ common words as their
brand name and (2) there are several domains and trademarks that
are too short to be considered for combosquatting. Table 3 shows a
list of trademarks that were ignored in the Alexa Top 500 due to
the previous considerations.
We manually inspected all 500 top Alexa domains to exclude
domains that fall into the two aforementioned categories. The re-
maining set contains 246 domains that we will consider in our
combosquatting study. We will refer to this list of domains as seed

throughout the rest of the paper. The trademarks selected belong
to companies that are active in different business categories. Thus,
we are able to group them together into 22 categories based on the
type of services/products they offer.
We derived this categorization using the Alexa list [14], the
TrendMicro [88] website and the DMOZ database [32]. We man-
ually verified the categories and merged any differences between
the platforms to create a consistent list. The vast majority of the
domains had a stable Alexa rank over time. At the same time, we
added seven domains that were a priori chosen in the “Politics” cat-
egory and 15 for the “Energy” category, following the same process
as before. We manually included the energy sector because it is
part of the critical infrastructure and the politics because of the US
Presidential elections of 2016.
3.2 Datasets
Since our goal is to study combosquatting both in depth and over
time, we require a variety of different datasets. Table 4 summarizes
the raw datasets used in this study, and Table 5 lists the most
important relationships between them. We provide more detail
about each of these datasets below.
Passive DNS: The passive DNS dataset (PDN S) consists of DNS
traffic collected since 2011, above a recursive DNS server located
in the largest Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the US. Specifically,
this dataset contains the DNS resource records (RRs) from all
successful DNS resolutions observed at the ISP, including their
daily lookup volume.
Active DNS: We also utilize an active DNS (ADN S) dataset,
which we obtain daily from the Active DNS project [24]. Since
the duration of this dataset is less than a year, it does not have a
complete temporal overlap with our PDN S dataset. While we will
use the PDN S and ADN S datasets for most measurement tasks,
we will also use a variety of smaller datasets to label and measure
abuse in these combosquatting datasets. Again, in Table 4 we can
see these five different datasets used in this study.
Public Blacklists: We collect historic public blacklisting (PBL)
information about domains that have been identified by the
security community as abusive and placed in various public
lists [2–9]. These blacklists have been collected from 2012 until
2016 and overlap with our passive and active DNS datasets.
Advanced Persistent Threats: Using public Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT ) reports 1, we manually extract and verify domain
names used in such documented attacks (APT).
Spam Trap: A security company provides us with spam trap [55]
data that is labeled using their proprietary detection engine (SPA).
Malware Feeds: The same security company and a university
provides us with two feeds of domains from dynamic execution of
malware samples since 2011 (MAL).
Alexa List: To eliminate potentially wrong classification of a
domain as abusive (false positive) in the aforementioned datasets,
we create a “whitelist” based on the Alexa list. We take the domains
that appeared in the top 10,000 of the Alexa list for more than 90
consecutive days in the last five years and create a set of domains
as indicators of benign activity (ALE).
Certificate Transparency: Google’s Certificate Transparency
(CT) [10] project provides publicly auditable, append-only logs
of certificates with cryptographic properties that can be used to
verify the legitimacy of certificates seen in the wild. The official CT
website provides a list of known, active logs that can be publicly
crawled. We used this list to download all records from those logs
up to April 13, 2017. This resulted in a dataset of approximately
271M certificates.
3.3 Linking Datasets
Next, we project the selected trademarks, into the raw datasets
