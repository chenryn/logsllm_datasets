installation of such a connections is a relatively infrequent event. Therefore, we
do not expect a noticeable inﬂuence on the number of false alerts; an assessment
that was conﬁrmed by our measurements shown in Section 6.2. Note that we did
not manually change any of these ‘anomalies’ for the evaluation of the detection
process, but we expect them to contribute to the observed false alarms.
6.2 Detection Evaluation
The detection approach was evaluated on BGP data collected during four dif-
ferent weeks over the last two years. We used the ﬁrst day of each week to build
our models and the subsequent six days as an input to the detection algorithms.
The ﬁrst two data sets are important to assess the detection capability of
our system as both hold traces of signiﬁcant misconﬁguration problems. The
ﬁrst data set (that starts on April 5th, 2001) contains an incident where Cable
and Wireless (AS3561) propagated more than 5000 improper route announce-
ments from one of its downstream customers [7, 18] that illegitimately claimed
large IP ranges. This lead to global connectivity problems for about 90 minutes.
Clearly, the corresponding messages should be identiﬁed as IP address ownership

violations. The second data set (that begins on January 10th, 2002) contains ev-
idence of a misconﬁguration where a customer propagated routes received from
its upstream provider to a peering partner [18]. This peer then continued to
forward the routes to its own upstream provider, thereby advertising routes to
parts of the Internet through the customer AS itself. This misconﬁguration is
similar to an attack where a periphery AS announces a route to other periphery
ASes through itself and the involved updates should be classiﬁed by our system
as invalid AS paths.
The third and fourth data set are, after reviewing the mailing list of the
North American Network Operators’ Group [25] for the periods in question, free
of major attacks or misconﬁgurations. These two weeks serve as more recent
data to verify that our assumptions about the AS connectivity graph are valid
and to provide an estimate for the false positive rate for the Internet at present.
Table 2 provides the results of our detection system. For each data set (col-
lected over six days), the table shows the total number of processed update
messages, the number of IP address ownership violations and the number of in-
valid AS paths that were reported. All alerts are classiﬁed as either correct or
incorrect. An alert is classiﬁed as correct when it is obviously related to one of
the two incidents in the ﬁrst two data sets as described above. All other alerts
are classiﬁed as incorrect. Closer examination of the incorrect alerts reveals that
a large percentage is due to the misclassiﬁcation of periphery nodes that are
in fact part of the core. Such misclassiﬁcations occur mainly for autonomous
systems located in Asia or Eastern Europe. The update messages collected from
Route View mostly contain traﬃc sent between ASes in Europe and the US, re-
sulting in an AS connectivity graph that is sparse for other regions. As the node
classiﬁcation relies on the degree of connectivity, core nodes in those regions may
not have enough neighbors in our graph and are thus labeled as periphery. To
obtain more precise data from these regions, we would require BGP data from
routers located in there. Other incorrect alerts might have been the result of
actual misconﬁgurations, but no supporting evidence was found for the relevant
dates on the network operator mailing list [25] and the alerts had to be classi-
ﬁed as incorrect. Another possible cause are invalid data utilized to create the
network topology model.
Note that the numbers in Table 2 reﬂect unique violations. That is, when mul-
tiple invalid update messages with identical routing information are observed,
only one alert is produced. This shows the potential tremendous impact of a sin-

gle misconﬁguration on the global infrastructure. For example, the 2148 diﬀerent
address ownership violations detected during one day of the ﬁrst test week were
the result of a single incident.
It is interesting to observe that the properties of the network graph as well as
the behavior of the system do not change noticeably for the test sets that reﬂect
samples from a period of over two years. This indicates that our assumptions
are stable and that detection can be performed reliably.
7 Future Work
This section gives an overview of our plans to extend the security model as well
as our presented technique.
A useful extension of the proposed approach to BGP security is the inclusion
of BGP policies. BGP speakers usually deﬁne policies that restrict the informa-
tion exchange with their respective neighbors and inﬂuence routing decisions.
This allows us to determine whether the current network graph conforms to
the speciﬁed policies and raise an alarm in case a deviation is detected. Such
deviations could either result from misconﬁgurations or malicious behavior.
The presented design does not automatically take into account changes of IP
address ownership and the removal of connections between autonomous systems.
It would be desirable to determine when IP address blocks have been transferred
between ASes without the intervention of an operator that has to remove the
binding from the database. This could be done by including information from the
Route Arbiter Project [29] or from miscellaneous network information centers.
Also, the information in withdrawal messages is not utilized. This is because it
is not straightforward to extract topology information from such updates.
8 Conclusion
The Border Gateway Protocol is the de facto standard for inter-domain routing
in today’s Internet. Although protocol design weaknesses and implementation
ﬂaws in many devices running BGP are well-known, it is diﬃcult to overcome
them. The huge base of installed equipment and the fact that, despite several
successful attacks, global routing seems to work satisfactorily create an enormous
reluctance to the adoption of newer protocols. Although approaches such as S-
BGP seem appealing at ﬁrst glance, they have not been widely deployed. In the
meantime, the concept of “security by obscurity” is the only protection against
potentially devastating attacks.
We have developed a technique to validate routing data in BGP UPDATE
messages to protect routers from installing falsiﬁed routes. The mechanism is
based on topology information of the autonomous systems connectivity graph
and geographical data from whois databases. It is capable of identifying updates
where a malicious or misconﬁgured router announces illegitimate IP address
blocks or invalid routes that do not exist. Our system can be applied immediately
and does not interfere with the existing infrastructure.
