  * VSCode Version: 1.2.0
  * OS Version: Win10
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Create a new file e.g. test.php
  2. Copy this:
        Test
  1. Set the language mode to PHP
  2. Select Theme: Dark+ (default dark)
  3. You will notice now, that there is some miss matching between a one line of code or when you expand it.
I'm not sure if this just a problem with the theme, how ever the problem
appeared when I installed to update to version 1.2 today.
