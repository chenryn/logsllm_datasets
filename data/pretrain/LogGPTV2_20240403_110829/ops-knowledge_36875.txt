User: Say I had over 10,000 feeds that I wanted to periodically fetch/parse.
If the period were say 1h that would be 24x10000 = 240,000 fetches.
The current 10k limit of the labs Task Queue API would preclude one from
setting up one task per fetch. How then would one do this?
Update: RE: Fetching nurls per task - Given the 30second timeout per request at some point this would hit a ceiling. Is
there anyway to parallelize it so each task queue initiates a bunch of async parallel fetches each of which would take less than 30sec to finish but the lot together may take more than that.
Assistant: Group up the fetches, so instead of queuing 1 fetch you queue up, say, a work unit that does 10 fetches.
