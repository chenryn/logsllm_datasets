Hence, electric power utilities need to extend risk management frameworks with adequate tools for assessing consequences of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) threats on their critical business. This requires realistic probability estimates to cyber threat occurrences and consequent failure modes. Due to data sensitivity and rapid discovery of new vulnerability exploits, historical data series of ICT failures affecting power control infrastructures are not sufficient for a timely risk treatment. Such lack of data can partially be overcome by setting up testbeds to run controlled experiments and collect otherwise unavailable data related to cyber misbehaviours in power system operation. Within the project CRUTIAL (CRitical UTility InfrastructurAL resilience) two testbed platforms have been set up for experimentally evaluating malicious threats on macro and micro grid control scenarios. Results from experimental campaigns are analyzed in the paper by means of an evaluation framework.  1. Introduction In the CRUTIAL project [1], the deployed testbeds are composed of two platforms. One platform – the Telecontrol Testbed – consists of power station controllers on a real-time control network, interconnected to corporate and control centre networks. The other platform – the Microgrid Testbed – is based on power electronic converters that are controlled from PCs that are interconnected over an open communication network. Both testbeds integrate elements from the electrical infrastructure as well as from the information (computing and communication) infrastructure, in order to focus on their interdependencies, and specifically on the vulnerabilities that occur in the electric power system when a part of the information infrastructure breaks down [2-5]. These testbeds are used to investigate • local, hierarchical and distributed control scenarios at transmission and distribution level; • how architectural patterns for enhancing robustness can be integrated in a realistic setup; • which interdependencies occur in practice. The two testbeds are complementary. The Telecontrol Testbed focuses on the operation and supervision of a distribution grid (high and medium voltage levels) with classic (local and hierarchically distributed) control algorithms. The Microgrid Testbed focuses on a distribution grid (low voltage levels) with innovative (local and fully distributed) control algorithms. This paper presents the implementation of several scenarios on both testbeds, as well as the corresponding evaluation results. The paper is structured along two parts: section 2 describes the experiments with the Telecontrol Testbed and section 3 those with the Microgrid Testbed.  2. Teleoperation testbed The Teleoperation testbed (Figure 1) addresses load reduction scenarios which may occur in power conditions presenting different degrees of severity. Load reduction usually occurs when the power system is exposed to disturbances due to deficiency conditions (faults, loss of generation, switching errors, lightning strikes, etc). The testbed platform [6] implements i) Manual teleoperations by grid operators in maintenance as well as pre-emergency management and ii) Automatic telecontrol actions involving both Transmission System Operators (TSO) and Distribution System Operator (DSO) control infrastructures in emergency conditions. The selected scenarios address both concrete needs and envisaged evolutions, related to the Distribution Grid’s control system. They have been conceived in view of a full integration in the operation and control infrastructures of the Power System, i.e. Generation, Transmission and Distribution, for the implementation 978-1-4244-4421-2/09/$25.00 c(cid:13)2009 IEEE
