### Abstract:
Distributed intelligence and secure interconnected communication networks are essential for the economic operation of electricity infrastructures in competitive power markets. Therefore, electric power utilities need to enhance their risk management frameworks with tools that can assess the consequences of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) threats on their critical business operations. This requires realistic probability estimates of cyber threat occurrences and their subsequent failure modes. Due to data sensitivity and the rapid discovery of new vulnerability exploits, historical data on ICT failures affecting power control infrastructures are insufficient for timely risk management. This data gap can be partially addressed by setting up testbeds to conduct controlled experiments and collect otherwise unavailable data related to cyber misbehaviors in power system operations. Within the CRUTIAL (CRitical UTility InfrastructurAL resilience) project, two testbed platforms have been established to experimentally evaluate malicious threats in macro and micro grid control scenarios. The paper analyzes the results from these experimental campaigns using an evaluation framework.

### 1. Introduction
The CRUTIAL project [1] involves the deployment of two testbed platforms. The first platform, the Telecontrol Testbed, consists of power station controllers on a real-time control network, interconnected with corporate and control center networks. The second platform, the Microgrid Testbed, is based on power electronic converters controlled by PCs connected over an open communication network. Both testbeds integrate elements from the electrical infrastructure and the information (computing and communication) infrastructure to focus on their interdependencies, particularly the vulnerabilities that arise in the electric power system when part of the information infrastructure fails [2-5].

These testbeds are used to investigate:
- Local, hierarchical, and distributed control scenarios at transmission and distribution levels.
- How architectural patterns for enhancing robustness can be integrated into a realistic setup.
- The interdependencies that occur in practice.

The two testbeds are complementary. The Telecontrol Testbed focuses on the operation and supervision of a distribution grid (high and medium voltage levels) using traditional (local and hierarchically distributed) control algorithms. The Microgrid Testbed focuses on a distribution grid (low voltage levels) using innovative (local and fully distributed) control algorithms. This paper presents the implementation of several scenarios on both testbeds, along with the corresponding evaluation results. The paper is structured into two main sections: Section 2 describes the experiments with the Telecontrol Testbed, and Section 3 details those with the Microgrid Testbed.

### 2. Telecontrol Testbed
The Telecontrol Testbed (Figure 1) addresses load reduction scenarios that may occur under various power conditions, ranging from minor to severe disturbances. Load reduction typically occurs when the power system is exposed to disturbances due to deficiencies such as faults, loss of generation, switching errors, or lightning strikes. The testbed platform [6] implements:
- Manual teleoperations by grid operators for maintenance and pre-emergency management.
- Automatic telecontrol actions involving both Transmission System Operators (TSO) and Distribution System Operator (DSO) control infrastructures during emergency conditions.

The selected scenarios address both current needs and future evolutions related to the Distribution Grid's control system. They are designed for full integration into the operation and control infrastructures of the Power System, including Generation, Transmission, and Distribution, to ensure comprehensive and effective implementation.
