User: In linux, we have a utility called “file”, which helps us to determine the identification of a file. Is there any python module that can do the same job?
I don't prefer to use subprocess.Popen(['file', 'blah.blah']),
because it is platform dependent. For instance, windows do not have “file” (although it can be downloaded).
Assistant: There are standard modules imghdr and sndhdr for graphic and sound files, respectively.
