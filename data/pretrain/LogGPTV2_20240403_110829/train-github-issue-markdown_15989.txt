Sorry, the best testcase I have right now is Servo master. If you run the
binary under gdb and try to break anywhere in the `compositing` crate, the
symbols just don't exist. You can't break by filename either. You can break on
mangled symbols, but there are no source positions. Other crates (like
`script`, for example) work perfectly fine.
