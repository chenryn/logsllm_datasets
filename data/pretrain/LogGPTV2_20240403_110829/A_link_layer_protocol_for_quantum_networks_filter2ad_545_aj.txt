resonant laser pulse is then used to cause emission of a photon, if the state was in the bright state, preparing the joint state of
√1 − α |1⟩C |0⟩P, where |0⟩P (|1⟩) denotes
the communication qubit (C) and an emitted photon (P) in the state √
the absence (presence) of a photon. This process succeeds with probability pem ≈ 0.03 without Purcell enhancement using
optical cavities. To ensure phase-stabilization only one laser may be used for both nodes, combined with local shutters to allow
node control. We remark that local control at the node is still desirable at a distance due to aligning with other operations such
as performing gates. to keep qubits stable. The heralding station interferes both incoming photons on a beam splitter, thereby
performing a probabilistic entanglement swap. Intuitively, this can be understood as a measurement of the incoming qubits in
the Bell basis, where we can only obtain outcomes |Ψ+⟩, |Ψ−⟩ or “other”. Since “other” is more than one possible state, we
declare failure in this case.
Depending on the clicks observed in the detectors, we have projected the state of the communication qubits at A and B
in the state |Ψ+⟩ = 1√2(|0⟩A |1⟩B + |1⟩A |0⟩B) (only left detector clicks), |Ψ−⟩ = 1√2(|0⟩A |1⟩B − |1⟩A |0⟩B) (only right detector
clicks), or we declare failure (either none or both of the detectors click). Success occurs with probability psucc ≈ 2αpdet, where
pdet is the probability of detecting an emitted photon.
During entanglement generation, a variety of noise processes occur:
(1) Dephasing of the nuclear spins (memory qubits) due to resetting the electron during entanglement generation attempts.
(2) Effective dephasing of the photon state due to uncertainty in the phase between the paths the photon travel to the
α |0⟩C |1⟩P +

emitted at different times.
(3) Effective dephasing of the photons state due to non-zero probability of emitting two photons.
(4) Effective amplitude damping of the photon state due to coherent emission, i.e. the photon is in a super-position of being
(5) Effective amplitude damping due to collection losses from non-unity probability of emitting the photon in the zero-phonon
line and non-unity collection efficiency into the fiber.
(6) Effective amplitude damping due to losses in fiber.
(7) Non-perfect beam-splitter measurement at the heralding stations due to photons not being perfectly indistinguishable.
(8) Errors in the classical outcome from the detectors due to non-unity detection efficiency and dark counts.
D.4.1 Dephasing mechanism on nuclear spins during entanglement attempts. Between every entanglement attempt, the
electron spin (communication qubit) needs to be reset. The dominant source of noise on the nuclear spins (memory qubits)
during the entanglement attempts is due to this re-initialization of the electron spin, as described in [58]. We model the noise
on the nuclear spins as a fixed amount of dephasing noise
(24)
for every entanglement attempt. The dephasing parameter depends on: the bright state population α, the coupling strength
∆ω and a decay constant τd as follows
Dpd(ρn) = (1 − pd)ρn + pdZ ρnZ
(25)
see equation (2) in [58]. If the length of the Bloch vector in the equatorial plane of the state in the nuclear spin is before the
entanglement attempts rX Y , then after N attempts the length will be
(1 − pd)N rX Y .
(26)
The bright state population can be chosen per experiment but the coupling strength and decay constant are fixed but vary
between different nuclear spins. The decay constant can also vary by performing different microwave control pulses of the

electron spin. As an example of these parameters, for the nuclear spin C1 and the standard microwave control pulses, the
coupling strength is ∆ω = 2π × 377 kHz and the decay constant is τd = 82 ns, see [58]. In the simulations we use these values
for the coupling strength and decay constant.
D.4.2 Phase uncertainty for photon paths. There is uncertainty in the phase between the paths the photon travels from the
nodes to the beam-splitter, due to for example uncontrolled stretching of the fiber. If this phase difference is ∆ϕ then the state
after a successful measurement at the heralding station (conditioned on there being only one photon) is

where eA is the electron spin at node A and eB is the electron spin at node B.
shown in [88], if we chose the dephasing parameter to be
We model this by performing dephasing noise to both qubits encoding the presence/absence of photon from A and B. As

pd =

(28)
then the standard deviation of the phase ϕ in the state between the electron (eA/eB) and the photon (pA/pB)
|0⟩eA |1⟩pA ± eiϕ |1⟩eA |0⟩pA
(29)
is precisely σ(ϕ). To efficiently compute quotients of modified Bessel functions we implemented the algorithm described in [5].
Note that the variance of the phase in equation (27) is twice the variance of the phase in equation (29). In experiments the
standard deviation of the phase for the state between the electrons, i.e. (27), has in [53] shown to be 14.3◦. Thus, we set the
standard deviation in equation (29) to be 14.3◦/√2.
D.4.3 Two-photon emission. There is a probability that two photons are emitted from the electron during the entanglement
generation attempt at a node. For the physical setup we assume the probability of there being two photons emitted, given that
at least one is emitted, to be approximately 4% [53]. As argued in [53], the two-photon event can effectively be modeled as
applying dephasing noise to the electron qubit which is part of the generated entanglement.
D.4.4 Coherent emission, superposition of time-modes. The emission of the photon is a coherent process and the photon is
actually in a super-position of being emitted at different times. As shown in [88], the effect of a finite detection window can be
seen as effective amplitude damping noise to the qubit encoding the presence/absence of a photon. The amplitude damping
parameter is then given by
(30)
where tw is the detection time window and τe is the characteristic time of the NV emission (12 ns without cavity [85] and 6.48
ns with cavity [88]).
pa = exp(−tw/τe),
D.4.5 Collection losses. We model non-unity collection efficiencies by effective amplitude damping noise on the qubit
encoding the presence/absence of a photon. The amplitude damping parameter is given by
(31)
where pzero_phonon is the probability of emitting a photon in the zero phonon line (3% without cavity and 46% with cavity [85])
and pcollection is the probability of collection the photon into the fiber. From [53] we know that the total detection efficiency of
the system is 4 · 10−4, which can be decomposed as
pa = (1 − pzero_phonon · pcollection),
(32)
where ptransmission is the probability that the photon is not lost during transmission in the fiber and pdetection is the probability
that the detector clicks, given that there was a photon. Using equation (32) we find that pcollection = 0.014 given the numbers
in [53]. Frequency conversion succeeds with probability 30% [105], so in this case we use pcollection = 0.014 · 0.3.
ptotal = pzero_phonon · pcollection · ptransmission · pdetection,
D.4.6 Transmission losses. Since the qubit sent from the node to the heralding station is encoded in the presence/absence of
a photon, the losses during transmission over fiber are modeled as amplitude damping noise. We use an amplitude damping
parameter pt_loss given as
(33)
where L is the length of the fiber (in km) and γ is assumed to be 5 dB/km without frequency conversion and 0.5 dB/km with
frequency conversion.
pt_loss = 1 − 10−L·γ/10

D.4.7 Distinguishable photons. Entanglement is generated between the electrons of the two nodes since the beam-splitter
in the heralding station effectively deletes the information of which node a detected photon came from. This information
is only perfectly detected if the photons emitted from the nodes are completely indistinguishable. In reality however, the
photons properties (spectral, temporal etc.) can be slightly different and they are therefore not completely indistinguishable. In
section D.4.7 we derive effective measurement operators of a beam-splitter measurement, taking photon indistinguishability
into account, which we make use of in our simulation. For the physical setup we simulate, the overlap (visibility) of the photons
coming from the nodes is approximately 0.9 [53], i.e. |µ|2 = 0.9 where µ is defined in equation (66).
D.4.8 Detection losses and dark counts. Detection losses and dark counts are modeled by probabilistically changing the
ideal classical outcome from the detectors at the heralding station. For each detector, if the ideal detector clicked the noisy
detector also clicks with probability pdetection and otherwise not. In the simulations we use pdetection = 0.8, as measured in [49].
If the ideal detector did not click the noisy detector does click with probability pdark. The parameter used for the dark count
is the dark count rate λdark = 20 per second [53]. The dark counts follow a Poisson distribution and we have that
pdark = 1 − exp(−tw · λdark),
(34)
where tw is the detection time window.
D.5 Heralding station
Let us now consider the measurement at the Heralding Station in more detail in order to understand its error models.
D.5.1 Distinguishable photons. We here describe how we model a beam-splitter measurement of two photons which are
not perfectly indistinguishable. This is relevant for many heralding entanglement generation schemes, since if photons are
distinguishable the beam-splitter will not erase the information of where the photons came from. Two perfectly indistinguishable
photons incident on a beam-splitter will always go to the same output arm, as captured by the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect [51].
However, if the photons are distinguishable they do not necessarily go to the same output arm, which can be detected in
experiment. For a given setup, lets denote the probability that two incident photons on the beam-splitter go to different output
arms as χ.
We will in this section derive the effective POVM and Kraus operators correspond to detecting photons at the ends of the
output arms of the beam-splitter in terms of χ, under the assumptions described below and using ideas from the paper [16]
where χ is computed.
D.5.2 Model. Assume that there is a 50:50 beam-splitter with input arms a and b and output arms c and d. At the end of the
output arms there are photon detectors that can click. We will assume that the detectors have a flat frequency response and at
first that the detectors can count photons, i.e. there are different measurement outcomes for there being one or two photons
incident on a detector. However we will show below how one can easily consider detectors which cannot count photons from
the analysis in this note.
Photons. In many simulations we model the presence or absence of a photon as a two-level system, i.e. a qubit α |0⟩ + β |1⟩,
where |0⟩ means no photon and |1⟩ one photon. We would then describe the state before the beam-splitter as a state living in a
2-qubit Hilbert space spanned by the following four basis vectors:
|00⟩lr ,
|01⟩lr ,
(35)
describing 0 photons, photon on the right, photon on the left and two photons. Here l and r corresponds to arm a and b of the
beam-splitter, but we distinguish these since we will denote a (and b) as the infinite dimensional Hilbert space describing the
spectral property of the photon. Note that we assume that there are never more than one photon per arm.
Describing the presence and absence of a photon as a qubit masks the fact that a photon can have many other degrees of
freedom, such as polarization, spectral and temporal properties. We will here focus on spectral and temporal properties and
will therefore model a photon in arm a with a spectral amplitude function ϕ as the state
|10⟩lr ,
|11⟩lr
(36)
where a†(ω) is the creation operator of a photon in arm a of frequency ω and |0⟩a is the vacuum and ϕ is normalized such that

Furthermore, the state of arm b will be described by a spectral amplitude function ψ as
dω ψ(ω)b
†(ω) |0⟩b .
(38)
Two photons arriving at the beam-splitter can have different spectral properties, captured by ϕ and ψ being different. We will
also include a possible temporal shift τ between the arrival times of the two photons. As described in equation (16) of [16], a
temporal shift of a photon in arm b induces the following action on the creation operators
Beam-splitter. The 50:50 beam-splitter acts on the creation operators in the following way:

Detectors. As mentioned we assume that the detectors have a flat frequency response. The event that the detector in arm c
detected one photon can then be described by the projector
Since we assume that there is maximally one photon arriving at each input arm of the beam-splitter the only other possible
measurement outcomes are described by the following projectors:

Deriving effective POVM on presence/absence description. The goal of this note is to derive the effective POVM on the
Hilbert space lr, spanned by vectors in equation (35), induced by the projective measurements in equations (46)-(51) on the
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space cd. To do this we will first define an isometry Ulr→cd from the Hilbert space lr to cd, using
the states in equation (35) and equations (42)-(45). This isometry will have the following action on the basis states of lr:
