Requiring a package in bundle e.g. `import camelcase from 'camelcase'`
resolves to `/node_modules/next/node_modules/camelcase` before
`/node_modules`.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Requiring a package that's a direct dependency resolves project's
`node_modules`
## Current Behavior
Webpack looks in next's nested node_modules
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. `yarn add camelcase@3.0.0`
  2. add import to a `pages/index.js` `import camelcase from 'camelcase'`
  3. `next build`
  4. Build bundles package/chunk using next's `camelcase` which is version 4 
    1. Which leads to an uglifyJS error because camelcase v4 is published as es2015.
## Your Environment
Tech | Version  
---|---  
next | 4.2  
node | 8  
Note: I know `camelcase` is not a browser module, but it's just an example.
