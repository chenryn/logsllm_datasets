I recently updated to the latest version of Webpack. However, when I run the `webpack -h` command, the output is truncated and does not display all the available options. In previous versions, the help command provided a more comprehensive list of options and details.

For reference, here is a screenshot illustrating the issue:

Could you please look into this and let me know if there's a known issue or if I might be missing something in my setup?
