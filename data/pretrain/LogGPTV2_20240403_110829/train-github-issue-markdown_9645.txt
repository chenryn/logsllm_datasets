  * Electron version: 1.2.0
  * Operating system: OSX (probably others)
Hi, I'm the maintainer of serialport. We've been getting a bunch if issues
with people not being able to use our latest release or beta release with
electron versions 1.2.x, the 1.1.x line seemed to work well enough. I don't
have the greatest of bug reports but a few users seem to have narrowed it down
to the versions change and I'm suggesting it to the new issues to see if
reverting to 1.1 solves their problems.

I'm going to upgrade `nan` for our next release but nothing in the change log
suggests it should effect support.
Any idea what I can do?
