I encountered an issue while attempting to upload my application to Google App Engine using the `appcfg` tool. The error message I received was:

```
This application does not exist (app_id=u'xxx').
```

Initially, I was only a developer on the existing App Engine project. To test, I created a new App Engine project where I was the owner, but I still encountered the same error.

For future reference, and in case others face a similar problem, I wanted to document the solution. The issue turned out to be that I had not added the user I was authenticating with as a developer on the project. In fact, I had just created the user and had not even logged in with that account yet.

To resolve this, I followed these steps:
1. Logged into the Google Cloud Console using the newly created user.
2. Added the new user as a developer on the application.
3. Attempted to upload the app again, which was successful.

By ensuring the user has the necessary permissions, I was able to resolve the "application does not exist" error.
