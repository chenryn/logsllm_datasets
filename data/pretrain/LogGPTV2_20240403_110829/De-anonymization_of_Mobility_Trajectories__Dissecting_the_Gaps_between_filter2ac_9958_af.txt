precision of using historical check-ins versus not using them.
Clearly, utilizing the historical check-in improves the perfor-
mance of all the algorithms. Intuitively, historical check-ins
can greatly mitigate the sparsity issues synchronized check-in
trajectories.
Validation using Dianping Trajectories.
Finally, we apply
our algorithms to de-anonymize the ISP dataset using the
45,790 app-level trajectories from Dianping as the external
information. This experiment has two purposes. First, to use
Dianping’s dataset to evaluate the performance of our algo-
rithms. Second, to simulate the scenario where ground-truth is
not available to train the GM-B algorithm. Here, we assume the
attacker does not have the ground-truth data from Dianping to
estimate the parameters for the GM-B algorithm. Instead, we
directly apply the parameters estimated from the Weibo dataset
to the Dianping experiment (empirical GM-B). As shown in
Fig. 9(c), the empirical GM-B has a competitive performance
with the best existing algorithm and GM algorithm with
parameters learnt from Dianping trajectory data. The result
shows the robustness of our proposed algorithm.
B. Parameter Evaluation
Finally, we examine how selected parameters in our algo-
rithm inﬂuence the attack results.
Impact of the Parameters in GMM.
Fig. 10 shows the
sensitivity of GMM’s performance against different parameter
settings. Fig. 10(a) shows the average hit-precision of the GM
As mentioned in Section V-B, POIS, WYCI, HIST, ME
and NFLX are based on “co-located” events. These algo-
rithms are likely to be sensitive to spatial mismatches and
even spatial resolutions. To be fair for these algorithms, we
examine their performance under different spatial resolutions
(temporal resolution is set to the default value 1 hour). For
comparison purposes, we also mark the performance of GM
and GM-B in the ﬁgures (using default 1 hour and 1km). As
shown in Fig. 8(d), most algorithms, i.e., NFLX, WYCI and
HIST, achieve their best performance under our default spatial
resolution of 1km, while POIS and ME algorithms achieve
their best performance under the spatial resolution of 2km.
Our proposed algorithms still outperform existing algorithms,
i.e., the GM and GM-B algorithms improve the mean hit-
precision by 31.6% and 83.8% relative to the best performance
of existing algorithms respectively.
Similarly, POIS, HMM, ME and MSQ are based on “con-
current” events, making them potentially sensitive to temporal
resolutions. Fig. 8(e) shows their performance of under dif-
ferent temporal resolution (spatial resolution is set to default
1km). The result shows that HMM and MSQ algorithms
achieve their best performance under our default temporal
resolution of 1 hour, while POIS and ME achieve their best
performance under the temporal resolution of 30min. Our
proposed algorithms still outperform existing algorithm, e.g.,
performance gap of GM and GM-B algorithms are 21.6% and
69.9% relative to the best existing algorithm respectively.
Validation using Weibo Check-in Trajectories.
To vali-
date our observations, we further evaluate the performance of
our algorithms using Weibo check-ins trajectories as external
information. We ﬁrstly focus on the 503 check-in trajectories
that have at least 1 records at the same time-window with
ISP dataset. The hit-precision is shown as the function of the
number of records of check-in trajectories in Fig. 9(a). As
we can observe, more records in check-in trajectories help to

algorithm with different maximum tolerate delay Hu. We use
Weibo’s app-level trajectories with 2+ distinct locations. As we
can observe, the hit-precision is improved slowly with a very
slow rate with Hu. For a better performance, Hu should be
set to a large value. However, as mentioned in Section VII-B,
the computational complexity of GM algorithm increases with
Hu. Thus, we should compromise between accuracy and
computational complexity in real de-anonymization attack.
Next, we examine the impact of parameter π and σ in
the GMM. For an adversary without a detailed ground-truth
dataset,
these parameters cannot be estimated by the EM
algorithm. To this end, instead of using parameters produced
by the EM algorithm, we apply different parameters from the
empirical distribution ﬁtting: σ(p) is set to be 0.5km for all p,
and π(p) is set to be the power-law or exponential distribution.
Then, we compare their performance in Fig. 10(b).
From the results, we ﬁnd that GM algorithm using power-
law empirical parameters outperforms the one using exponen-
tial empirical parameters. The result is consistent with our
prior observation that Weibo’s mismatches follow a power-law
distribution. In addition, the performance of using power-law
empirical parameters is very close to that of the ground-truth
parameters estimated by the EM algorithm. This indicates that
our algorithm is robust — the performance does not depend
on an accurate parameter estimation as long as the suitable
distribution model is selected.
Impact of the Parameters in Markov Mobility Model.
The key parameter of the Markov mobility model
is the
component. Below, we evaluate the impact of the order of
Markov and location context.
In Fig. 11(a), we show the impact of using 0-order Markov
or 1-order Markov, as well as ignoring the dependency between
external records. Speciﬁcally, we use 0-order (simpliﬁed) to
represent the GM algorithm with 0-order Markov mobility
model ignoring dependency between external records. In ad-
dition, maximum tolerate delay Hu is set to be 1 hours, and
π and σ use the value estimated by EM algorithm. As shown
in Fig. 11(a), very small difference of hit-precision can be
observed between different settings, indicating that the order
of Markov and dependency between external records have
small impact on the performance. In addition, Fig. 11(b) shows
the relative performance gain for GM algorithm with location
context compared with it without location context. As we can
observe, by utilizing the location context, over 25% relative
performance gain is achieved, demonstrating its effectivity.
Experiment Limitation.
As mentioned in Section V-B,
for each trajectory in the external datasets, there must exist
a matched trajectory in the ISP dataset. In practice, however,
the external dataset may contain users that are not in the ISP
dataset. To this end, the performance of all de-anonymization
algorithms (including ours) is an upper bound. The above
experiments have demonstrated the advantage of our proposed
algorithms based on the relative comparisons with existing
algorithms.
In summary, we demonstrate that de-anonymization attack
can be more effective by tolerating spatial and temporal
mismatching (GM algorithm), and modeling the user behavior
of the given service (GM-B algorithm). Speciﬁcally, the total
performance gain in terms of hit-precision is more than 17%
compared with the existing algorithms. Further, by adding
historical check-ins and location context, another 30% to
150% relative gain can be achieved. Finally, we show that the
proposed algorithms are robust against the parameter settings
of the models. The result suggests that even without ground-
truth data to estimate parameters, our proposed algorithms will
stay robust using empirical parameters.
IX. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we use two sets of large-scale ground truth
mobile trajectory datasets to extensively evaluate commonly
used de-anonymization methods. We identify a signiﬁcant
gap between the algorithms’ empirical performance and the
theoretical privacy bound. Further analysis then reveals the
main reasons behind the gap: the algorithm designers often
underestimate the spatio-temporal mismatches in the data col-
lected from different sources and the signiﬁcant noises in user-
generated data. Our proposed new algorithms that are designed
to cope with these practical factors have shown promising
performance, which conﬁrms our insights.
Our work has key implications to de-anonymization al-
gorithm designers by highlighting the key factors that matter
in practice. For example, we show that temporal mismatches
are more damaging than spatial mismatches. The intuition is
that spatial mismatches are naturally bounded by the strong
locality of human movements. To this end, having the algo-
rithm tolerating temporal mismatches (or both) is the key. On
the other hand, in order to provide better location privacy
protections, practical factors should also be considered. Our
result shows that both user mobility patterns and location
context have helped the de-anonymization. This means it might
be no longer sufﬁcient to use simple mechanisms to manipulate
the time and location points in the original trajectories. Privacy
protection algorithms should consider the user and location

better privacy protection mechanisms.
