to detect any significant change in the fraction of deficiently con-
figured systems (avg: 92%, std: 0.8%, min: 91%, max: 94%). Still, in
84 cases, we detect certificate renewals on servers with static IP
addresses and can investigate whether operators change certifi-
cates as part of software updates or use this opportunity to switch
to secure ciphers. In nine cases, we observed a simultaneous soft-
ware update (as per OPC UA’s SoftwareVersion field). While all
renewed certificates were self-signed and valid, only in seven cases
security increased by replacing SHA-1. Surprisingly, one certificate
renewal even resulted in a downgrade from SHA-256 to SHA-1.
Analyzing the combined 4296 certificates retrieved over all mea-
surements, we observe that 2174 (50%) SHA-1 certificates were gen-
erated after the deprecation of the corresponding security policies
in 2017 (NotBefore field), with 1923 SHA-1 certificates still being
created and deployed since the beginning of 2019.
Furthermore, we observe continuing deployments of devices
from the same manufacturer where multiple devices use the iden-
tical certificate (cf. Section 5.3), noticeably increasing from 263
devices on 2020-02-09 to 387 devices on 2020-08-09 indicating that
the distributor still installs devices by copying certificates.
Takeaway: Weekly scans over seven months and the analysis of
certificates generated in a longer timespan show that the security of
OPC UA deployments did not improve over time, e.g., by certificate ex-
change. We even observe continuous insecure deployments of systems
relying on deprecated ciphers and/or sharing the same certificate.
6 CONCLUSION
OPC UA is the prime candidate to realize standardized and secure
industrial communication for an increasing industrial digitaliza-
tion [55]. In this paper, we study whether the general security of
OPC UA’s design [19] leads to secure Internet-facing deployments.
Using Internet-wide active measurements, we show that 92% of
all 1114 Internet-reachable OPC UA deployments are configured
deficiently: First, we reveal servers completely disabling commu-
nication security (26%) or relying on deprecated cryptographic
primitives (25%) such as SHA-1. Second, we discover the incorrect
application of theoretically secure configurations on additional 35%
of systems. Partly, these systems are also affected by a system-
atic reuse of security-critical certificates on hundreds of systems
across various autonomous systems. Finally, we find that 44% of all
servers allow unauthenticated users to read and write values from
industrial devices and even execute system functionality.
Our analysis in this paper uncovers configuration deficits of
OPC UA devices reachable via IPv4. It might be possible that various
OPC UA devices are connected via IPv6 only and therefore are not
captured in our scans. We do not anticipate that these devices are
configured more securely, but leave this analysis for future research.
To conclude, our results underpin that secure protocols, in gen-
eral, are no guarantee for secure deployments if they need to be
configured correctly following regularly updated guidelines that
account for basic primitives losing their security promises. Thus, we
are strongly convinced that it is imperative to reduce configuration
complexity in security protocols and demand secure defaults for
all configuration options, eventually transitioning from security by
design to security by default. Given the overall still comparatively
small number of Internet-connected OPC UA appliances at the be-
ginning of the uptake of the fourth industrial revolution [39, 51],
now is the perfect time to rethink and reinforce the security config-
uration of OPC UA deployments and thus eventually realize secure
industrial Internet-wide communication.
