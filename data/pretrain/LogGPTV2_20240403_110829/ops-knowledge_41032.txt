User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Squid3 cache limitation? I'm using Squid3 for its caching capabilities on a bunch of IPv6 addresses. The only thing is, only 128 of them initialize properly, and any more won't connect.

Can you think of any settings that I can check?

From logs:

WARNING: You have too many 'http_port' lines
The limit is 128

Assistant: squid/src/defines.h has:

#define MAXHTTPPORTS                    128


change that value. In ubuntu: get the source package, rebuild and install.
