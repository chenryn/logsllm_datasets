User: I am trying to have my app on Amazon appstore. 
In order to do this Amazon needs to park a small json file (web-app-manifest.json).
If I upload it to the the root of my web site (as suggested), Amazon bot says it cannot access file. Amazon support mention I should save it to /var/www/static but either I don't know how to get there or I don't have access to this part of the server.
Any ideas ?
Assistant: You can get to /var/www/static in the File browser. Just click on the '/' in the path at the top of the page and then follow the links.
You can also just copy things there from a Bash console.
You may need to create the static folder in /var/www if it's not there already.
