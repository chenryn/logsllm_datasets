# ==> What is "Podcasting"?
# Podcasting is a method of distributing audio content (such as radio shows) over the Internet. 
# These audio files can be played on devices like iPods and other music players. 
# This script automates the process of downloading and organizing podcasts.
# For more details, see the documentation at the author's site.

# Change to the directory where this script is located
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Define the directory for saving podcasts
datadir=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Create the datadir if it does not exist
if [ ! -d "$datadir" ]; then
    mkdir "$datadir"
fi

# Remove any existing temporary log file
rm -f temp.log

# Read the bp.conf file and download URLs not already in the podcast.log file
while read -r podcast; do
    # Extract the URL from the podcast feed
    file=$(wget -q -O - "$podcast" | tr '\r' '\n' | tr \' \" | sed -n 's/.*url="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
    
    # Process each URL
    for url in $file; do
        echo "$url" >> temp.log
        if ! grep -Fxq "$url" podcast.log; then
            wget -q -P "$datadir" "$url"
        fi
    done
done < bp.conf > temp.log

# Update the podcast log with unique URLs
sort temp.log | uniq > podcast.log
rm temp.log

# Create an m3u playlist
ls "$datadir" | grep -v m3u > "$datadir/podcast.m3u"

exit 0

### Changes Made:
1. **Formatting and Comments**: Improved the formatting and added clearer comments to explain the purpose of each section.
2. **Variable Quoting**: Added double quotes around variables to handle filenames and directories with spaces.
3. **Command Improvements**:
   - Used `grep -Fxq` to check for exact matches in the `podcast.log` file.
   - Ensured that the `bp.conf` file is read correctly by using `< bp.conf` in the `while` loop.
4. **Code Clarity**: Simplified and clarified the code to make it more readable and maintainable.
