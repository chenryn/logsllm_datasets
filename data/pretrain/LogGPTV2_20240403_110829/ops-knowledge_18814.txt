User: I need to change my computer's local date to an earlier date (e.g. 2010). I couldnt do that in BIOS. Does anybody know how to do this task, for example by writing a Python snippet?
Thanks.
Assistant: If you use Windows, you should be able to do that in the time and date control panel (should be self explaining). 
If you use Linux, use the date command, and maybe hwclock (more info in the man pages).
If you use AmigaOS, use the appropriate settings window in the system Preferences folder.
If you use any other OS, you should have mentioned here which one you use...
