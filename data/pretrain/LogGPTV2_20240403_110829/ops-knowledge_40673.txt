User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Block people searching for server admin pages Occasionally I flip through our (apache) access log and I often come across people trying to fish for admin pages. For example, they are trying to access pages like:

/wp-login.php
/administrator/index.php
/admin.php
/user


None of these pages/directories actually exist as they never have or I've renamed them to something not too obvious.

So, do people actively block these kinds of requests? I sometimes do, but I get a lot, and I'm wondering if it actually makes any different. Currently I block the host or IP in my httpd.conf file. 

Am I worrying over nothing?

(FYI - running Apache on a 'linux' based server).

EDIT: From the perspective of 'sub-enterprise' (small-medium business level).

Assistant: There are some advantages to blocking such requests at the firewall level, namely:


IPTABLES takes less resources to block the connection than Apache
does to return an error.
It will keep your log files smaller and
cleaner.


You mentioned blocking the hosts in httpd.conf. This is not as useful.. The bots are receiving a 404 anyway, it doesn't benefit you nor harm them any to send a different error code (which is all blocking in httpd.conf is going to do)

The only benefit to blocking in httpd.conf is that a malicious host that is trying to hack a non-existent page now, might try to hack a real page later. Of course, you can obtain the same benefit by blocking at the firewall level, along with the other advantages mentioned above.

tl;dr: Block the requests, with fail2ban, not with httpd.conf
