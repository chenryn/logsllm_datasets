User: Please explain how to use Git for version control during the development process, and briefly describe the basic workflow of Git.
Assistant: Using Git for version control during the development process can help developers track code change history, collaborative development, merge code, etc., which is of great convenience. The following is the basic workflow of Git: 1. Create a local warehouse: Use the git init command to create a new local warehouse in the project directory. 2. Add files: Use the git add command to add files to Git's "to be submitted" area. 3. Submit changes: use the git commit command to package all changes in the "to be submitted" area into a "commit", and describe it. 4. Create a remote warehouse: push the local warehouse to GitHub or other Git servers to achieve team collaboration. 5. Pull the remote warehouse: other team members can use the git clone command to copy (clone) the code from the remote warehouse and develop based on it locally. 6. Pull the latest changes: If other people have made changes to the code, users can use the git pull command to fetch them and merge the changes into the local code base. 7. Change the code: users can edit and change the code, and use the git add and git commit commands locally again to save the changes and commit. 8. Push changes: Push local changes to the remote warehouse for others to use. The basic workflow of Git is very easy to grasp, and developers can quickly get started through official documents and tutorials.
