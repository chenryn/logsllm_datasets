## Abstract
While traffic between web servers and web browsers is well-known to many end users, the extent of server-to-server web traffic over the public internet is less understood. We refer to the former as front-office web traffic and the latter as back-office web traffic. Back-office traffic, which may or may not be triggered by end-user activity, is crucial for supporting complex web services such as large-scale content delivery, social networking, indexing, searching, advertising, and proxy services. This paper provides an initial analysis of back-office traffic, measured from various vantage points including ISPs, IXPs, and CDNs. We describe methods for identifying back-office traffic based on its role in the web ecosystem. Our measurements show that back-office traffic constitutes a significant portion of both core internet traffic and web transactions. Finally, we discuss the implications and opportunities that back-office traffic presents for the evolution of the internet ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction
The Web has revolutionized how people publish, access, and search for content. The HTTP protocol serves as a common interface for many popular internet applications, including video, social networking, e-commerce, and software delivery. These applications often rely on advertisements, also delivered via HTTP.

Although an end user typically views a web page as a single unit, recent studies have shown that a single web page can involve multiple servers and companies. For example, a web page may include elements from a content provider, a web advertiser, a video streamer, a search engine, and a social network. Fetching even a single part of a web page can involve numerous parties, including proxies, content delivery networks (CDNs), ad-sellers, ad-bidders, back-end servers, and crawler bots.

Thus, there is more to content delivery than meets the eye. This paper explores the distinction between front-office and back-office web traffic. Front-office traffic involves direct interaction with end users, while back-office traffic is exchanged between machines within the web service ecosystem. Figure 1 illustrates this distinction. Note that not all back-office traffic travels over the public internet; some is carried over private backbones or within data centers. In this paper, we focus on back-office web traffic on the public internet.

Front-office traffic has been extensively studied, but back-office traffic has received less attention. While there are studies on machine-to-machine traffic in specific environments, such as cellular networks and data centers, we are not aware of comprehensive studies on back-office web traffic on the public internet. Previous work has focused on front-office traffic because it directly impacts end-user Quality of Experience (QoE). However, as more web services depend on back-office communication, service QoE now also depends on the performance of the back-office, which increasingly relies on the public internet.

Studying back-office traffic is challenging because it is rarely present on the network links connecting end users to the internet. Instead, it can generally only be observed on backbone or inter-domain links. Existing studies of inter-domain and/or backbone traffic have not separated front-office and back-office web traffic. To observe this traffic, a variety of vantage points is required. In this paper, we analyze data collected from two IXPs, multiple links of a Tier-1 ISP, and a major CDN.

Web services involving back-offices include content delivery, search, and advertisements. Content delivery accounts for a significant fraction of all internet traffic, while advertisements, especially those in response to search, contribute significantly to internet revenues. CDNs, which operate sophisticated back-offices with distributed server infrastructures, are responsible for a large portion of this traffic. Search engines, which rely on crawling the web and processing data in large data centers, also contribute to back-office traffic. Online advertisements, particularly through real-time bidding (RTB), generate a substantial amount of back-office traffic.

In summary, the contributions of this paper are:
- We introduce the concept of back-office web traffic and show that it contributes, on average, 10% to 30% of traffic at different vantage points, and can exceed 40% during certain periods.
- Our methodology allows us to identify and classify different types of back-office traffic, including proxy services, crawling, and advertisement bidding.
- Our analysis demonstrates that back-office traffic characteristics differ from front-office characteristics and vary enough by service to allow individual services to be identified.
- We find, for example, that at one IXP, auctioneers account for 22% of back-office requests but only 1% of bytes, while crawlers contribute roughly 10% and 15% to both.
- Our analysis of data from a major CDN confirms the significance of back-office web traffic.
- Given the volume and importance of back-office traffic for end-user QoE, we identify implications for network protocol design and co-location strategies.

## 2. Back-Office Communication
This section provides an overview of the typical communication patterns of web services that generate back-office traffic. We distinguish four cases: (a) proxies/intermediaries, (b) CDN services, (c) auctioneers, and (d) crawlers. Figure 2 illustrates the expected exchange of HTTP messages, though our analysis reveals richer and more complex communication patterns.

### (a) Proxies/Intermediaries
A proxy is a network entity that acts as both a client and a server. As shown in Figure 2(a), a web proxy forwards HTTP(S) requests. When intermediaries act as clients, they create back-office traffic, but when they act as servers, the traffic can be either front- or back-office. We describe how to differentiate these cases in Section 6.

### (b) CDN Servers
CDNs typically operate front-end servers (reverse proxies) close to the end user and back-end servers. Back-end servers either host the content in data centers or are closer to the origin content server. If the front-end does not have a requested object, it fetches it from another front-end, a back-end, or the origin server. Optimizations for creating overlays and task sharing between front-end and back-end servers are deployed to improve performance.

### (c) Ad Exchanges â€“ Auctioneers and Bidders
As shown in Figure 2(c), advertisement exchanges consist of publishers that sell ad space and advertisers that buy ad space. The matching is often performed using real-time bidding (RTB). When an end user visits a web page with available ad space, the ad exchange auctioneer contacts potential bidders, providing visitor information to start a bidding process. The final advertisement content is typically delivered via CDNs. We focus on RTB-related activity, i.e., back-office traffic resulting from auctioneers interacting with bidders.

### (d) Crawlers
Web crawlers continuously index the web. Each crawl bot is typically responsible for indexing a small part of the web, requesting web pages and following embedded links. Crawlers issue an order of magnitude more web queries than regular end users. Best practices ensure that crawlers have appropriate reverse DNS entries and well-specified user agents to avoid being blocked by websites.

Hereafter, we refer to back-office web traffic as all web traffic that is not exchanged between end users and servers, including traffic exchanged between intermediaries and web servers.
