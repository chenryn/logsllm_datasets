**Note:** You can scan your application proxy instance by executing [script](../Feature/Scripts/ADAppProxyScanScript.ps1.txt) in PowerShell.
ApplicationProxyDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix Script
Only security compliant apps should be onboarded to AAD App Proxy
AAD App proxy facilitates remote access to your on-prem apps. If these apps have not been designed and implemented securely, then security issues of your apps get exposed to the internet.
HighNoNo
AAD Authentication must be enabled as a pre-authentication method on your app
Pre-authentication by its very nature, blocks a significant number of anonymous attacks, because only authenticated identities can access the back-end application.
HighNoNo
Delete personal data captured in logs on connector machine periodically or turn off connector machine logging if not required
Connector machine logs may contain personal data. This needs to be handled with care and purged when not needed in keeping with good privacy principles.
HighNoNo
HTTP-Only cookie must be enabled while configuring App Proxy wherever possible
Using an HTTP-Only cookie protects against cross site scripting (XSS) attacks by disallowing cookie access to client side scripts.
HighNoNo
Use a security hardened, locked down OS image for the connector machine
The connector machine is serving as a 'gateway' into the corporate environment allowing internet based client endpoints access to enterprise data. Using a locked-down, secure baseline configuration ensures that this machine does not get leveraged as an entry point to attack the applications/corporate network.
