User: I'm building custom CRM web based system and have integrated synchronization of contacts and reminders with Google apps and need do the same with Apple iCloud. Is there any way how to do it? I haven't find any official API for this purpose, CRM is written in PHP, but I'm able to use python for this purpose as well.
Assistant: I would recommend that you sync using the google contacts api.  Then, you can tell iPhone people to use that instead of iCloud.
