User: This is a weird bug. I know it's something funky going on with my PATH variable, but no idea how to fix it.
If I have a script C:\Test\test.py and I execute it from within IDLE, it works fine. If I open up Command Prompt using Run>>cmd.exe and navigate manually it works fine. But if I use Windows 7's convenient Right Click on folder >> Command Prompt Here then type test.py it fails with import errors.
I also cannot just type "python" to reach a python shell session if I use the latter method above.
Any ideas?
Edit: printing the python path for the command prompt that works yields the correct paths. Printing it on the non-working "Command prompt here" yields: Environment variable python not defined".
Assistant: I don't use Windows much, but maybe when you open Right Click -> Command Prompt, the PATH is different from navigate manually. First try to print your PATH (oh I have no ideal how to do this) and see if it different in 2 situation.
