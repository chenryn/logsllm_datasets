Table 6: Squatted Skills in the Alexa skills store—We show
examples of squatted skills in the Alexa skills store that drew our
attention during manual analysis. Notably, a customer review
of the “phish geek” skill noted they were unable to use the
application due to common confusion with the “ﬁsh geek” skill.
rently exist on the store. For example, “cat facts” has a
corresponding squatted skill, “cat fax”, which seemingly
performs the same function, though published by a dif-
ferent developer. In another example, “Phish Geek” [9],
which purports to give facts about the American rock band
Phish, is squatted by “Fish Geek” [5], which gives facts
about ﬁsh. Anecdotally, one user of “Phish Geek” appears
to have experienced squatting, writing in a review:
I would love it if this actually gave facts about
the band. But instead, it tells you things like
“Some ﬁsh have fangs!”
Ultimately, we have no clear evidence that any of these
skills of interest were squatted intentionally. However,
this does provide interesting insight into some examples
of what an attacker may do and further validates our
assertion that our phoneme-based approach can prove
useful in ﬁnding such examples in the wild.
6 Spear Skill Squatting
We have thus far demonstrated skill squatting attacks that
target speakers at an aggregate level. We next ask the
question, “Can an attacker use skill squatting to target
speciﬁc groups of people?” To accomplish this, we intro-
duce a variant of the skill squatting attack, called spear
skill squatting. Spear skill squatting extends skill squat-
ting attacks by leveraging words that only squattable in
targeted users’ demographic. Spear skill squatting draws
its name from the closely related spear phishing family
of attacks, which are phishing attacks targeted at speciﬁc
groups of individuals [25]. In this section, we identify and
validate spear skill squatting attacks by targeting speakers
based on their geographic region and their gender.

Figure 8: Regional Intersection of Squattable Words—We show the 6-way intersection of squattable words by region. Squattable
words that affect all regions are omitted. Each region is denoted by a dot in the bottom half of the graph. If a squattable word is
shared between two or more regions, the region-dots are connected with a line. The height of each bar corresponds to the number of
squattable words per region-intersection. There are 11 squattable words that target just one speciﬁc region.
6.1 Demographic Effect on Accuracy
The 60 speakers in the NSP corpus are separated both by
dialect-region (10 speakers per region) and gender (30
speakers identify as male, 30 identify as female). We
ﬁrst examine if user demographics play a factor in Alexa
accuracy rates.
In order to quantify the differences in accuracy between
regions, we run a chi-squared “goodness-of-ﬁt” test. This
test is used to determine whether a particular distribu-
tion follows an expected distribution. To not over report
this statistic given our sample size, we only consider the
most common interpretation per speaker per word, rather
than use 50 interpretations per speaker per word. As we
would like to measure whether interpretation errors hap-
pen across all regions with equal probability, our null
hypothesis is that there is no signiﬁcant difference in ac-
curacy between the regions. Our chi-squared test returns
a p-value of 6.54∗ 10−139, indicating strong evidence to
reject the null hypothesis. This demonstrates that at least
one region has a signiﬁcant difference in accuracy from
the rest, with a conﬁdence interval > 99%.
We next investigate whether Alexa has different accu-
racy rates when interpreting speakers of different genders.
We ﬁnd that Alexa is more accurate when interpreting
women (71.9%) than men (66.6%). In addition, a two
proportion z-test between the groups shows a statistically
signiﬁcant difference at a conﬁdence interval of 99% (p-
value: 1.03∗ 10−9).
6.2 Squattable Words by Demographic
These results indicate that Alexa interprets speakers dif-
ferently based on their region and their gender. We next
investigate whether the interpretation errors for each de-
mographic are systematic and, as a result, can be used by
an adversary to launch a spear skill squatting attack.
To identify squattable words based on region, we ﬁrst
split our speakers into their respective dialect-region. Us-
ing the techniques outlined in Section 4, we identify the
systematic errors that affect each region in isolation. This
produces a total of 46 unique squattable words that are
occur at least in one region. However, this also includes
squattable words that affect every region. Because this
attack focuses on targeting speciﬁc groups of individuals,
we exclude squattable words that affect all regions. Af-
ter removing these, we are left with 22 squattable words
that target a strict subset of all regions. For example, the
interpretation error from Pull/Pole, only affects system-
atically speakers from the West, New England, Midland,
and Mid-Atlantic regions, but not speakers from the North
or South. In contrast, the error Pal/Pow only systemati-
cally impacts speakers from the Midland region.
Figure 8 shows the distribution of these squattable
words per region-intersection. Notably, there are 11 squat-
table words that each affect one region in isolation. Ta-
ble 7a further breaks down these speciﬁc squattable words
and their systematic interpretation errors by region. An at-
tacker can leverage any of these in order to target speakers
from one speciﬁc region.
We then apply the same technique to ﬁnd squattable
words based on speaker gender and observe a similar re-
sult— there are squattable words that only affect speakers
based on their gender. Table 7b provides a breakdown
of the pairs of squattable words and their interpretation
errors that affect speakers by gender. There are 12 squat-
table words that an adversary could leverage to target
speakers based on their gender.

Table 7: Validating the Spear Skill Squatting Attack—We test our spear skill squatting attacks in a developer environment. The
last column shows the p-value of a proportion z-test checking whether there is a statistically signiﬁcant difference, at a conﬁdence
interval of 95%, between the success rates of the attack against the region/gender group and the overall population. Our attacks are
successful in impacting speciﬁc demographic groups 8 out of 11 times by region and 10 out of 12 times by gender.
6.3 Validating Spear Skill Squatting
We next turn to validating that our spear skill squatting
attacks will work in a skill environment. To test this, we
use a methodology similar to that described in Section 5.1,
where we build skills in a developer environment and
observe the rate at which our squatted skill is favored
over the target skill. Table 7 shows the breakdown of
our squatting attempts to target speakers based on both
their region and gender. For 8 out of the 11 region-based
attacks, we observe a statistically different rate of success
for our attack than when compared to the rate of success
observed for the rest of the population. Our attack works
slightly better when targeting speakers by gender, with an
attack working in 10 out of the 12 cases.
Our results provide evidence that such an attack can
be successful in a skill environment. We acknowledge
that our results are inherently limited in scope by the
size of our dataset. An adversary with better knowledge
of squattable words can construct new attacks that are
outside the purview of our analysis; thus, further scrutiny
must be placed on these systems to ensure they do not
inadvertently increase risk to the people that use them.
7 Discussion
7.1 Limitations
A core limitation of our analysis is the scope and scale of
the dataset we use in our analysis. The NSP dataset only
provides 188 words from 60 speakers, which is inadequate
for measuring the full scale of systematic misinterpreta-
tions of Amazon Alexa. Although our phoneme model
extends our observed misinterpretation results to new
words, it is also conﬁned by just the errors that appeared
from querying the NSP dataset.
Another limitation of our work is that we rely on the
key assumption that triggering skills in a development
environment works similarly to triggering publicly avail-
able skills. However, do not attempt to publish skills

or attack existing skills on the Alexa skills store due to
ethical concerns. A comprehensive validation of our at-
tack would require that we work with Amazon to test the
skill squatting technique safely in their public, production
environment.
7.2 Countermeasures
The skill squatting attack relies on an attacker registering
squatted skills. All skills must go through a certiﬁcation
process before they are published. To prevent skill squat-
ting, Amazon could add to the certiﬁcation process both
a word-based and a phoneme-based analysis of a new
skill’s invocation name in order to determine whether it
may be confused with skills that are already registered.
As a similar example, domain name registrars commonly
restrict the registration of homographs —domains which
look very similar visually—of well known domains [34].
These checks seem not to be currently in place on Alexa,
as we found 381 pairs of skills with different names, but
likely to be squatted on the store (Section 5.4).
Short of pronunciation based attacks, there already ex-
ist public skills with identical invocation names on the
Alexa skills store. For example, there are currently more
than 30 unique skills called “Cat Facts”, and the way
in which Amazon routes requests in these cases is un-
clear. Although this is a benign example, it demonstrates
that some best practices from other third-party app store
environments have not made their way to Alexa yet.
Attacks against targeted user populations based on their
demographic information are harder to defend against, as
they require a deeper understanding of why such errors
occur and how they may appear in the future. Amazon
certainly has proprietary models of human speech, likely
from many demographic groups. Further analysis is re-
quired in order to identify cases in which systematic errors
can be used to target a speciﬁc population.
8 Future Work
While we have demonstrated the existence of systematic
errors and the feasibility of skill squatting attacks, there
remain several open challenges to quantifying the scope
and scale of these results.
Collecting Richer Datasets.
The conclusions we can
draw about systematic errors are limited by the size of
our speech corpus. We ﬁnd that, in theory, 16,836 of
the 23,238 (72.5%) unique skills in the Alexa skills store
could potentially be squatted using our phoneme model.
However, without additional speech samples, there is no
way for us to validate these potential attacks. In order to
more thoroughly investigate systematic errors and their
security implications, we must curate a larger, more di-
verse dataset for future analysis. We suspect that with a
larger set of words and speakers, we would not only be
able to quantify other systematic errors in Alexa, but also
