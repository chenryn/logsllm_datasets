INTRODUCTION
The rise of social media and data-capable mobile devices
has transformed global journalism. Brief, text-based and
easy to translate, social messages allow the public to skip
the middleman and get news “straight from the source.”
Whether used by “citizen” or professional reporters, how-
ever, social media technologies pose risks that endanger
users. First, social media platforms are often proprietary,
exposing users’ data and activities to scrutiny from collabo-
rating companies and governments. Second, the online net-
works that citizen reporters use are inherently fragile, con-
sisting of easily targeted devices and relatively centralized
message-routing systems that authorities may block or shut
down. Finally, this same privileged access can be used to
ﬂood the network with inaccurate or discrediting messages,
drowning the signal of real events in misleading noise.
A citizen journalist is someone who is simply in the right
place at the right time. Untrained and unevenly tech-
savvy, citizen reporters may not consider social media ac-
tivities high-risk. The dangers citizen journalists face
are personal and physical. Addressing their needs for
protection, resilience, and recognition requires a move away
from assumptions of in vitro communication security.
Our response to this pressing need is Dispatch project1.
Dispatch allows citizen reporters to publish text and images
using authenticated pseudonyms. Dispatch is built on the

Egocentric Social Platform (ESP) [5], as well as the Musubi
platform [2], allowing for encryption based on virtual iden-
tities while presenting a feed-based interface. ESP utilizes
Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) [1] to avoid key exchange
diﬃculties. Dispatch also provides censorship-tolerant func-
tionality in the form of Bluetooth message passing when
there is no Internet connection. With stable iOS and An-
droid versions, Dispatch provides secure, networked publish-
ing and communication tools to the journalism community.

Figure 1: Dispatch Architecture
2.1 Secure Communication
On ESP, messages are encrypted end-to-end with IBE, al-
lowing users to encrypt messages without exchanging public
keys beforehand. Boneh and Franklin discovered a method
to perform identity-based cryptography using Weil pairings
[1]. Hess showed in [3] how a signature scheme can be en-
abled without accessing the trusted party for each message.
A message router routes encrypted messages based on
hashed identities and cannot identify users using anonymous
pseudonyms or view or modify messages. Thus, Dispatch
messages are organized into disintermediated feeds which
ensure that only mobile devices have access to the raw con-
tent. A key property of IBE is that because keys can be
derived from identities, messages can be sent to a recipient
even before the recipient has started using the application.

We call the identiﬁer that a user chooses her virtual iden-
tity. In Dispatch, the virtual identity is a handle selected by
the user the ﬁrst time she logs in to Dispatch. Because it
is anonymous, a separation between the virtual identity and
the reporter’s real identity is achieved.
Messages can be addressed to anyone, although the com-
mon candidates are the virtual identities of other reporters
and the virtual identities owned by publishing servers. A
one-way SHA-256 hash function is applied over the virtual
identity, to further protect the identity inside the system.
Because of the negligible probability of hash collisions [4],
the hashed identiﬁer is available to use as a unique property
of the reporter, allowing her to establish a reputation based
on the content she anonymously delivers.
2.2 Publishing Server
The publishing server securely receives content intended
It can then either automatically post the
for publishing.
content, or support human review before posting.
The key component of the publishing server is an Android
device that runs the same software as the client. The soft-
ware is able to leverage ESP to securely receive messages and
report success and failure status, if the publisher desires, and
has the same user-friendly interface should human review be
required. A publisher can send high-level object types that
map well to object types provided in publisher APIs to have
them posted by the publishing server. A second beneﬁt to
using the Dispatch Android software is that it has few sys-
tem requirements, ensuring that it can be installed and used
virtually anywhere. Furthermore, by adding the server as a
group user, the server becomes addressable and reachable
even its IP address changes. Content can be securely dis-
seminated to any number of publishing endpoints over ESP.
2.3 Bluetooth Message Forwarding
In the unstable regions that Dispatch targets, interrupted
infrastructure is a signiﬁcant risk. The unavailability of In-
ternet access may be caused by a number of forces, including
short range Internet jamming, nationwide Internet cut-oﬀs,
or IP address blockage at central hubs by governments.
2.3.1 Forwarding Protocol
Dispatch addresses this problem building on two impor-
tant notions. Fundamental to our approach is the concept
of Content Based Routing (CBR). Because the messages in
ESP contain the hashed recipient identity in the payload,
the messages can be routed through arbitrary means.
The second notion that underlies our solution is that in
the absence of infrastructure, human mobility can be used
to transport messages.
In Dispatch, we have developed a
”sneakernet” where Dispatch users physically carry messages
to aid in forwarding. Messages are routed from device to de-
vice by explicit handoﬀ, until eventually a ”gateway” device
reaches global connectivity and can deliver the message to
the message router. When two users meet, they transfer
unsent messages amongst themselves. These meeting points
form the ”hops” in our network.
It is important to note two properties of this protocol.
First, because the messages are signed and encrypted, they
can not be read nor tampered with by any user serving as a
message carrier. Secondly, messages that a user transports
for someone else, which are not addressed to that user, can
Implementation on iOS
not be viewed in raw form on that user’s device. This saves
him from being implicated by the message content.
2.3.2
The ”sneakernet” in the iOS version of Dispatch allows
users to explicitly exchange unsent messages. This way, a
user can select people he trusts to transport the messages,
alleviating the risk of malicious ﬂooding in the system by
adversary parties. To initiate the transfer, both parties sim-
ply push a button inside the app and follow a guided pairing
process. This establishes an ad-hoc peer-to-peer Bluetooth
connection between the two phones and then transfers all
unsent messages both ways.
After a transfer, the message contents remain signed and
encrypted, and the hashed identiﬁer of the recipient is still
present in the message. Thus, to publish, only one of the
devices must be able to reach connectivity to the message
router. At that point, the device will automatically transmit
the messages it currently carries. Each device and the mes-
sage router will automatically remove duplicate messages.
3. CONCLUSION
Dispatch is an application that simultaneously seeks to
provide protection and usability for both professional and
citizen journalists. It is built speciﬁcally for conﬂict report-
ing scenarios, allowing for dissemination of content quickly
and in such a way that is resilient to Internet disconnec-
tion. Dispatch is designed so that components including
the key issuer, publishing server, and message router can be
deployed privately, ensuring that reporting organizations or
community groups can control the visibility of the content.
Development of Dispatch is a work in progress. However,
as the journalism community begins to adopt Dispatch and
incorporate it into reporting workﬂows, the resulting feed-
back will serve to continuously improve the platform. The
ultimate goal of Dispatch is to create an intuitive reporting
tool that can be used in any situation of any threat level.
