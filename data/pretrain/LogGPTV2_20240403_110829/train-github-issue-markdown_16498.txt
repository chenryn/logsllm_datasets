I suspect this has to do with a Chromium "no-JavaScript-efficiency" thing that

I found this while battling a strange yet currently unticketable issue where
if you open devtools for a webview on the `did-start-loading` event, jQuery
does not have access to the `document` object (or something) and dies during
require, wwhich does **not** happen if devtools is opened _after) `did-finish-
load`.
