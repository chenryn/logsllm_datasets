### Managing and Monitoring Mail Services

#### Retrieving and Archiving Messages
To ensure that all new messages are retrieved, you can set up your email client to automatically fetch them. Alternatively, you can periodically copy and archive messages directly from the destination directory using automated shell commands. Additionally, you can configure filters in the email client to highlight specific types of messages. For legal or compliance reasons, it is advisable to archive all messages.

**To save all messages:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computers & Services** pane.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Check the box for “Copy incoming and outgoing messages to” and enter a user name or group name.
5. Click **Save**.

#### Monitoring Mail Service
This section describes how to use the Server Admin application to monitor various aspects of the mail service, including:
- Overall mail service activity, such as the number of incoming and outgoing mail connections.
- Currently connected mail users.
- Mail accounts.
- Mail service logs.

It also explains how Mac OS X Server reclaims disk space used by logs and how you can manually reclaim this space.

##### Viewing Overall Mail Service Activity
You can use Server Admin to get an overview of the mail service activity, including whether the service is running, when it started, and the number of incoming and outgoing connections by protocol.

**To see an overview of mail service activity:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computer & Services** list.
2. Click the **Overview** button.

##### Viewing the Mail Connections List
Server Admin can display a list of currently connected mail users, showing their user name, IP address, type of mail account (IMAP or POP), number of connections, and connection length.

**To view a list of mail users who are currently connected:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computer & Services** list.
2. Click the **Connections** button.

##### Viewing Mail Accounts
You can use Server Admin to view a list of users who have used their mail accounts at least once. The list includes the user name, disk space quota, disk space used, and the percentage of available space. Unused mail accounts are not listed.

**To view a list of mail accounts:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computer & Services** list.
2. Click the **Accounts** button.

##### Viewing Mail Service Logs
The mail service maintains four logs, which can be viewed using Server Admin:
- **Server log**: General mail service information.
- **IMAP log**: IMAP-specific activity.
- **POP log**: POP-specific activity.
- **SMTP log**: SMTP-specific activity.

**To view a mail service log:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computer & Services** list.
2. Click the **Logs** button.
3. Choose a log type from the **Show** pop-up menu.

##### Setting Mail Service Log Detail Level
Mail service logs can show different levels of detail:
- **Low (errors only)**
- **Medium (errors and messages)**
- **High (all events)**

**To set the mail service log detail level:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computer & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Logging** tab.
4. Choose a detail level from the **Log Detail Level** pop-up menu.

##### Archiving Mail Service Logs by Schedule
Mac OS X Server automatically archives mail service logs after a certain period. Each archive log is compressed to save disk space. You can customize the schedule to archive logs after a specified number of days.

**To archive logs by schedule:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computer & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Logging** tab.
4. Enter the desired number of days.

##### Reclaiming Disk Space Used by Mail Service Log Archives
Mac OS X Server automatically reclaims disk space used by mail service logs when they reach a certain size or age. If you are comfortable using the Terminal application and UNIX command-line tools, you can use the `diskspacemonitor` command to monitor and manage disk space. For more information, see the command-line administration guide.

#### Dealing With a Full Disk
If the disk storing your mail reaches maximum capacity, mail services can become erratic and suffer from data corruption. Here are some behaviors you may encounter:
- **Postfix behavior**: If the operating system can still spawn the `smtpd` process, Postfix will try to function and accept the message, but it will be rejected with a "disk full" error. Otherwise, its behavior is unpredictable.
- **Cyrus behavior**: If the operating system can still spawn an `imapd` or `pop3d` process, the server will attempt to open the user's mail account. Any changes requiring database additions can cause the process to hang and corrupt the database.

#### Working With Undeliverable Mail
Mail messages might be undeliverable for several reasons, such as misspelled addresses or deleted user accounts. You can configure your mail service to forward undeliverable incoming mail, limit attempts to deliver problematic outgoing mail, report failed delivery attempts, and adjust mail service timeouts.

**To set up forwarding of undeliverable incoming mail:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Mail** in the **Computer & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Check “Forward mail addressed to unknown local users” and enter a user name or group name.
5. Click **Save**.

### Mailing Lists

Mailing lists distribute a single email message to multiple recipients. Unlike workgroups, mailing lists are not linked to file or directory permissions and can be administered by someone other than the workgroup or server administrator. Subscribers do not need an account on the list’s server, and they can often self-manage their subscriptions.

Mac OS X Server uses Mailman version 2.1.2 for its mailing list service. For more information, visit www.list.org.
