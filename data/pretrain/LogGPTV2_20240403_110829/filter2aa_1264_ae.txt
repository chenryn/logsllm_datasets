account by retrieving all new messages. Otherwise, you may want to periodically copy 
and archive the messages directly from the destination directory with automated shell 
commands. You can set up filters in the email client to highlight certain types of 
messages. Additionally, you can archive all messages for legal reasons.
To save all messages:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2 Click Settings.
3 Select the General tab.
4 Check “Copy incoming and outgoing messages to” and type a user name or group 
name.
5 Click Save.
Monitoring Mail Service
This section describes how to use the Server Admin application to monitor the 
following:
• Overall mail service activity, including the number incoming or outgoing connected 
mail connections.
• Current connected mail users.
• Mail accounts.
• Mail service logs.
This section also describes how Mac OS X Server reclaims disk space used by logs and 
how you can reclaim space manually.

Chapter 2    Mail Service Maintenance
Viewing Overall Mail Service Activity
You can use Server Admin to see an overview of mail service activity. The overview 
reports whether the service is running, when mail service started, and incoming and 
outgoing connections by protocol.
To see an overview of mail service activity:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computer & Services list.
2 Click the Overview button.
Viewing the Mail Connections List
The Server Admin application can list the users who are currently connected to the 
mail service. For each user, you see the user name, IP address of the client computer, 
type of mail account (IMAP or POP), number of connections, and the connection 
length.
To view a list of mail users who are currently connected:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computer & Services list.
2 Click the Connections button.
Viewing Mail Accounts
You can use the Server Admin application to see a list of users who have used their 
mail accounts at least once. For each account, you see the user name, disk space quota, 
disk space used, and the percent of space that is available to the user. Mail accounts 
that have never been used are not listed.
To view a list of mail accounts:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computer & Services list.
2 Click the Accounts button.
Viewing Mail Service Logs
The mail service maintains four logs, and you can use Server Admin to view them. 
• Server log:  General mail service information goes into the Server log. 
• IMAP log:  IMAP-specific activity goes into this log. 
• POP log:  POP specific activity goes into this log. 
• SMTP log:  SMTP specific activity goes into this log. 
To view a mail service log:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computer & Services list.
2 Click the Logs button.
3 Choose a log type from the Show pop-up menu.

Setting Mail Service Log Detail Level
Mail service logs can show several levels of reported detail. The three levels of detail 
are:
• Low (errors only)
• Medium (errors and messages)
• High (all events)
To set the mail service log detail:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computer & Services list.
2 Click Settings.
3 Select the Logging tab.
4 Choose a detail level from the Log Detail Level pop-up menu.
Archiving Mail Service Logs by Schedule
Mac OS X Server automatically archives mail service logs after a certain amount of time. 
Each archive log is compressed and uses less disk space than the original log file. You 
can customize the schedule to archive the logs after a set period of time, measured in 
days.
To archive logs by schedule:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computer & Services list.
2 Click Settings.
3 Select the Logging tab.
4 Enter the desired number of days.
Reclaiming Disk Space Used by Mail Service Log archives
Mac OS X Server automatically reclaims disk space used by mail service logs when they 
reach a certain size or age. If you are comfortable using the Terminal application and 
UNIX command-line tools, you can use the command-line tool “diskspacemonitor” to 
monitor disk space whenever you want, and delete or move the log archives. For 
additional information, see “diskspacemonitor” in the command-line administration 
guide.

Chapter 2    Mail Service Maintenance
Dealing With a Full Disk
Mail services become erratic and suffer from data corruption if the disk storing your 
mail reaches maximum capacity. When your disk reaches full capacity, you’ll experience 
the following behaviors:
• Postfix behavior
If the operating system can still spawn the smtpd process, Postfix will try to function 
and attempt to accept the message. The message will then be rejected with a “disk full” 
error. Otherwise, its behavior is unpredictable.
• Cyrus behavior
If the operating system can still spawn an imapd or pop3d process, the server will 
attempt to open the user's mail account. Upon success, the user can access mail as 
normal. Any changes that require database additions and causing the database to 
grow can cause the process to hang and corrupt the database.
Working With Undeliverable Mail
Mail messages might be undeliverable for several reasons. You can configure your mail 
service to forward undeliverable incoming mail, limit attempts to deliver problematic 
outgoing mail, report failed delivery attempts, and change mail service timeouts to 
increase chances of connection success.
Incoming mail might be undeliverable because it has a misspelled address or is 
addressed to a deleted user account. Outgoing mail might be undeliverable because 
it’s misaddressed or the destination mail server is not working. 
Forwarding Undeliverable Incoming Mail
You can have mail service forward messages that arrive for unknown local users to 
another person or a group in your organization. Whoever receives forwarded mail that’s 
incorrectly addressed (with a typo in the address, for example) can forward it to the 
correct recipient. If forwarding of these undeliverable messages is disabled, the 
messages are returned to sender.
To set up forwarding of undeliverable incoming mail:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computer & Services list.
2 Click Settings.
3 Select the General tab.
4 Check “Forward mail addressed to unknown local users” and type a user name or group 
name.
5 Click Save.

Internet
There is an abundance of information about the different mail protocols, DNS, and 
other related topics on the Internet.
Request for Comments (RFC) documents provide an overview of a protocol or service 
and details about how the protocol should behave. If you are a novice server 
administrator, you may find some of the RFC background information helpful. If you are 
an experienced server administrator, you will find all the technical details about a 
protocol in its RFC document. You can search for RFC documents by number at this 
web site: 
www.faqs.org/rfcs
For technical details about how mail protocols work, see these RFC documents:
• POP:  RFC 1725
• IMAP:  RFC 2060
• SMTP:  RFC 821 and RFC 822

3 Mailing Lists
Mailing lists distribute a single email message to multiple recipients. Mailing lists differ 
from workgroups in a few fundamental ways. First, mailing lists are not linked to file or 
directory permissions. Mailing lists can be administered by someone other than the 
workgroup or server administrator. More importantly, mailing list subscribers do not 
have to have any kind of account (mail or file access) on the list’s server; any email 
address can be added to the list. Finally, list subscribers can often remove themselves 
from lists, and add themselves to lists.
Mac OS X Server uses Mailman version 2.1.2 for its mailing list service. You can find 
more information about Mailman at the website www.list.org.
Setting Up a List
This section describes the process of setting up a mailing list. To do this, you enable the 
service, define a list name, and add subscribers to the list.
Enabling Mailing Lists
Before you can define mailing lists and subscribers, you need to enable the list service.
To enable the mailing lists:
1 In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computer & Services list.
2 Click Settings.
3 Select the Mailing Lists tab.
4 Click Enable Mailing Lists.
5 Click Save.

Administering Lists
Mailing lists can be administered by a designated list member, called “list 
administrators.” List administrators can add or remove subscribers, and can designate 
other list administrators. 
If the designated list administrator is not an administrator of the server, all of his or her 
tasks are done by sending email to the list address with commands in the subject line 
or body. To find out more about the commands available to list administrators, please 
see the website www.list.org.

Glossary
Glossary
This glossary defines terms and spells out abbreviations you may encounter while 
working with online help or other Mac OS X Server Documentation. References to 
terms defined elsewhere in the glossary appear in italics.
alias  Another name at your domain that is not the user’s login name, but will send 
incoming email to that user.
DNS (Domain Name System)  A distributed database that maps IP addresses to 
domain names. A DNS server, also known as a name server, keeps a list of names and 
the IP addresses associated with each name. 
filter  A “screening” method used to control access to your server. A filter is made up of 
an IP address and a subnet mask, and sometimes a port number and access type. The 
IP address and the subnet mask together determine the range of IP addresses to which 
the filter applies. 
firewall  Software that protects the network applications running on your server. IP 
Firewall service, which is part of Mac OS X Server software, scans incoming IP packets 
and rejects or accepts these packets based on a set of filters you create.
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)  A client-server mail protocol that allows 
users to store their mail on the mail server rather than download it to the local 
machine. Mail remains on the server until the user deletes it.
IP (Internet Protocol)  A method used with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to send 
data between computers over a local network or the Internet. IP delivers packets of 
data, while TCP keeps track of data packets.
ISP (Internet service provider)  A business that sells Internet access and often provides 
web hosting for ecommerce applications as well as mail services.
Kerberos  A secure network authentication system. Kerberos uses tickets, which are 
issued for a specific user, service, and period of time. Once a user is authenticated, it is
