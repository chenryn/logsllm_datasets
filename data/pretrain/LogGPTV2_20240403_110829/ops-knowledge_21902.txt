I am currently working on a project that integrates C++ framework functions and Python modules. While I can run the project without any issues in Wing IDE (personal version), I have encountered difficulties with debugging during runtime. The IDE only allows me to debug a specific file, which is not very helpful for my needs. My workflow involves calling a shell script from a Python file (init.py) to execute a C++ framework function, which then calls a Python module that I need to debug. I've faced the same problem with PyCharm as well. Despite spending a considerable amount of time trying to resolve this, it remains an unresolved issue.

However, following some advice, I copied the `wingdbstub.py` file (from the debugger packages of Wing IDE) into the directory where my project is located. By importing `wingdbstub` in my code, I was able to initiate the debugging process successfully. This approach has allowed me to debug the modules effectively while the program is running.
