User: I am running a project that makes calls to C++ framework functions and python modules, I can run it on Wing IDE with no problems (personal version). However, I can not debug on the run. It only lets me debug a certain file, which is pretty useless. I make a call to a shell script to run the framework function via a python file (init) and that function calls a python module that I want to debug. I have had the same problem with pyCharm. I have spent quite a while trying to figure this out, something that should be very basic. How can I fix this problem and debug on the go???
Assistant: Following the comments above, I have copied the wingdbstub.py file (from debugger packages of Wing ide) to the folder I am currently running my project on and used 'import wingdbstub' & initiated the debug process. All went well, I can now debug modules.
