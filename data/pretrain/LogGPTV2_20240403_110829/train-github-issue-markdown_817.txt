 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
According to the ANSI standards SQL:92, SQL:1999, and SQL:2003, a UNIQUE
constraint should disallow duplicate non-NULL values, but allow multiple NULL
values. SQL Server has always implemented a crippled version of this, allowing
a single NULL but disallowing multiple NULL values. From
http://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/299229/change-unique-
constraint-to-allow-multiple-null-values
To fix this issue SQL has added the filtered indexes feature. Using this
feature it is possible to perform the logic of an index to a filter set of
items in a table using a WHERE clause. i.e.
    create unique nonclustered index idx on dbo.DimCustomer(emailAddress)
    where EmailAddress is not null;
Attached is a patch which applies the above feature when SQL 2008 or newer is
used as a server. This patch has been tested on Windows 7/SQL Server 2012
using pyodbc and the normal SQL Server driver.
