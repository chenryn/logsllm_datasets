User: Please describe best practices for continuous delivery
Assistant: Best practices for continuous delivery include: 1. Automated testing: Continuous delivery of applications must be accompanied by automated testing, which ensures the quality of delivery and reduces rollbacks and fixes due to human error. 2. Continuous integration: Integrate continuous integration tools to ensure continuous integration and construction of code, and allow rapid troubleshooting and repair. 3. Requirements Management: All requirements should be tracked and any changes should be approved and verified to ensure the quality of delivery. 4. Version Control: Version control tools should be used to manage and track changes to application code and configuration files. 5. Continuous deployment: Automated deployment should be used to obtain the benefits of continuous delivery, automatically identify the version after the build is successful, and automatically deploy to the target environment. 6. Transparency and feedback: Providing real-time feedback and monitoring is the key to continuous delivery, and real-time feedback and indicators should be provided to ensure the normal operation of the delivery process. 7. Delivery pipeline: An effective delivery pipeline is the key to continuous delivery, and appropriate development tools and delivery platforms should be used, such as Jenkins, GitLab, etc. Through these best practices, you can ensure continuity, reliability, and high quality of delivery, increasing the efficiency and value of your applications.
