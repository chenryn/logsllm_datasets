User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题ufw portforwarding to virtualbox guest My goal is to be able to connect using remote desktop on my desktop machine, to windows xp running in virtualbox on my linux server.

My setup:


server = debian squeeze, 64 bit, with a public IP address (host)
virtualbox-ose 3.2.10 (from debian repo)
windows xp running inside VBox as a guest; bridged networking mode in VBox, ip = 192.168.1.100
ufw as the firewall on debian, 3 ports are opened: 22 / ssh, 80 / apache, and 3389 for remote desktop


My problem:
If I try to use remote desktop on my home computer, I am unable to connect to the windows guest. If I first "ssh -X -C" into the debian server, then run "rdesktop 192.168.1.100", I am able to connect without issue. The windows firewall was configured to allow remote desktop connections, and I've even turned it off (as it is redundant here) to see if that was the problem but it made no difference.

Since I am able to connect from inside the local subnet, I suspect that I have not setup my debian firewall correctly to handle connections from outside the LAN. Here is what I've done...

First my ufw status:

ufw status                                                                                                   
Status: active                                                                                                                          

To                         Action      From                                                                                             
--                         ------      ----
22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
80                         ALLOW       Anywhere
3389                       ALLOW       Anywhere


I edited /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf and added:

net/ipv4/ip_forward=1


Edited /etc/default/ufw and added:

DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"


Edited /etc/ufw/before.rules and added:

# setup port forwarding to forward rdp to windows VM
*nat
:PREROUTING - [0:0]

-A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 3389 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100
-A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport 3389 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100

COMMIT

# Don't delete these required lines, otherwise there will be errors
*filter

&lt;snip&gt;


Restarted the firewall etc., but no connection.

My log files on the debian host show this (my public ip address was removed for this posting but it is correct in the actual log):

Although this is the current setup / configuration, I've also tried several variations of this; I thought maybe the ISP would be blocking 3389 for some reason and tried using different ports, but again there was no connection.

Any ideas...? Did I forget to modify some file somewhere?

Assistant: I'm really not being snarky with this, but you need to do your IPTAbles "firewall" management with something better than UFW. 

It's fine for desktop use, but it designed for just that and not "server grade" usage.

I would highly suggest sitting down and spending some quality time learning how NetFilter/IPTables works and becoming comfortable with using those commands directly. If you're afraid that you'll break something, making backups of your IPTables config before changes or perhaps even a basic 'Git' version control setup will help you experiment and gain confidence.
