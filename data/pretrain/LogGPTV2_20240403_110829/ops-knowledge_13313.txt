User: On a Linux server, how to set up IPTables firewall, restrict access and strengthen port security?
Assistant: To set up an IPTables firewall, restrict access, and strengthen port security on a Linux server, follow these steps: 1. Install iptables Use the following command to install iptables: ```bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install iptables ``` 2 . Set firewall rules You can use the iptables command to set firewall rules, such as allowing access to the SSH service (port 22): ```bash sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT ``` Similarly, you can prohibit access to a certain For example, prohibit access to HTTP service (port 80): ```bash sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport http -j DROP ``` 3. Restrict access can be restricted from a certain IP address or IP through iptables Access to the address segment, for example: ```bash sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.2.0/24 -j DROP ``` The above command will prohibit access from 192.168.1.100 Address and access from 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255 address segment. 4. Port security hardening can restrict certain ports to be accessed only by specified IP addresses through iptables, for example: ```bash sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -s 192.168.1.100 -j ACCEPT sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport mysql -s 192.168.1.100 -j ACCEPT sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport mysql -s 192.168.2.0/24 -j ACCEPT sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport mysql -j DROP ``` The above command will allow access to SSH and MySQL services from 192.168.1.100 addresses, allow access to MySQL services from 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255 address range, and prohibit MySQL access from other IP addresses.
