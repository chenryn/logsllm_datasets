I have encountered a deadlock issue in my code, which I believe occurs during a specific phase of code generation. To illustrate the problem, I've created a small test case. Although it is not in the exact same context as my original code, I suspect that the underlying bug is the same.

Here is the test case:

```julia
Threads.@threads for i in 1:1
end
no_such_function()
```

Naturally, this should produce an error because `no_such_function` is undefined. On Julia 1.1, this is indeed the case, regardless of the number of threads specified. However, on the current master branch, the code deadlocks if more than one thread is used. I performed a bisect and found that the commit `0136fa1` is likely responsible for this behavior.
