I have some code that deadlocks, I think during some phase of code generation.
Here's a little test case. Not quite the same context as my code, but I think
the same bug:
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:1
    end
    no_such_function()
This should give an error of course, because `no_such_function` is undefined.
That's what it does on julia 1.1 regardless of the number of threads, but it
deadlocks for me on master if >1 threads are specified. I ran a bisect which
implicated this commit `0136fa1`
