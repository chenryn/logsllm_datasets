community-based database, had the largest number of entries as
we collected data spanning several years. As GSB and Symantec
DeepSight are databases maintained by commercial companies,
they provide lists of malicious domains that have been inspected
by security experts with high confidence. We applied the blacklists
to 3,280 of detected IDN homographs, which include non-active
domains. Table 14 lists the results. We note that the numbers shown
in the table do not include ones shown in the previous subsection;
the previously found malicious websites had redirected URLs. By
incorporating SimChar into the homoglyph DB, the number of
detected malicious IDN homographs increased.
6.4 Reverting to Original Domains
Although we begin with a reference domain name list to search for
IDN homographs, this approach may not detect IDN homographs if
a non-popular website is targeted. Therefore, if we find a malicious
domain name, which is composed as an IDN, it is useful to be able to
identify the original domain name targeted by the IDN homograph
attack. Otherwise, we cannot trace the possible damage caused
by the attack. Thanks to the homoglyph database we developed,
we can revert to the possible original domain name by replacing a
homoglyph with the corresponding Basic Latin letter. We reverted
the malicious IDNs to the original domain names and removed
those were contained in the Alexa top-1k domains. We ended up 91
of malicious IDNs whose original domains were not contained in the
Alexa list. This observation indicates that there were non-negligible
number of malicious IDN that targeted non-popular websites. Our
approach can automatically revert such domains.
7 DISCUSSION
In this section, we first discuss the limitations of our work, after
which we consider effective countermeasures against the threat of
an IDN homograph attack.
7.1 Limitations
The primary contribution of this study was to build an automated
framework that can detect a Unicode homoglyph and an IDN ho-
mograph. Below we discuss several limitations of the approaches
IMC ’19, October 21–23, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands

we followed for evaluating our framework as well as their future
extensions.
Confusability Test In this work, we evaluated the confusability of
homoglyphs by a single character, i.e., participants judged whether
a potential homoglyph is confusable or distinct by viewing a pair of
characters. However, as homoglyphs are generally abused in a word
or even in a sentence, we may also need to study the confusability
of homoglyphs by using words or sentences because this context
may affect the user’s perception. The context-aware evaluation of
the confusability of a homoglyph is left for future study.
Font Type In this work, we leveraged GNU Unifont, which is a
bitmap-based font. GNU Unifont is one of the widely available
Unicode glyphs with a wide range of coverage, but many other
Unicode fonts are available in the wild, e.g., Noto font [13], which
is a scalable font. As our framework is automated, it would be
straightforward to extend our evaluation to other font families.
This would be a future task.
Measurement Target Our measurement study focused on the
world’s most popular TLD, .com, yet many other TLDs are used
in the wild. For instance, the blacklists we used in this work con-
tain 1,054 of domain names attributed to the ‘рф’ TLD, which is
the Cyrillic country code TLD for the Russian Federation. Study-
ing such class of malicious IDNs from the viewpoints visual de-
ception is left for future study. In addition, although current IDN
homograph attacks are mainly targeted at ASCII domains, IDNs
that contain non-ASCII characters are emerging. Such IDNs may
contain ideographs such as Hieroglyphs. Our approach can cover
homoglyphs consisting of any characters including the ideographs.
Studying these potential targets of homograph attacks and their
threats would also be a future topic.
7.2 Countermeasures against IDN Homograph
Attacks
As we have shown in Section 2, countermeasures against an IDN
homograph attack implemented in modern browsers have the fol-
lowing drawbacks: if an IDN violates a rule of permitted characters,
the countermeasure forcibly represents the IDN in the form of
Punycode, which is not a user-friendly expression. This counter-
measure may not provide a user with any indication of the context
behind such transcoding. Moreover, a countermeasure is not ef-
fective against non-IDN homographs where homoglyphs reside
in the same Unicode block; i.e, the IDN conforms with the rule of
permitted characters.
To explicitly inform the user of the possibility of an IDN homo-
graph attack with a reasonable context would require the user to
be presented with the Unicode representation, instead of forcibly
converting the IDN to Punycode. To this end, we could adopt a user
interface (UI) that emphasizes the difference between the original
domain name and the potential IDN homograph. Figure 12 presents
an image of such a UI, which could be implemented with the aid of
homoglyph databases such as SimChar and UC. We note that sizes
of SimChar and UC are small enough to be embedded into a client
program such as Browser extension/plug-in.. This UI would enable
a user to understand which part of a domain name is replaced by
which character. This information would be expected to play a vital
role in informing the user about the possible threat of a phishing

against an IDN homograph attack based on the homoglyph
database.
attack caused by an IDN homograph. More importantly, as an IDN
is designed to provide a user-friendly expression of a domain name
by using native languages, forcibly converting an IDN to Punycode
would significantly impair the user experience. We expect the adop-
tion of such an interface to improve users’ awareness of the possible
threats posed by an IDN homograph attack; i.e., they would become
more knowledgeable regarding the context of the presented domain
names and be more aware of possible threats. Implementation and
evaluation of such a method could be the subject of further study.
7.3 Ethical Considerations
In Section 4, we performed human study to assess the human per-
ception on the detected homoglyphs. Before conducting our human
study experiments, we carefully followed the checklist provided
by our institutional IRB and concluded that our experiments con-
formed with the principles of the research ethics. The fact that our
user study does not collect any personally identifiable information
nor privacy-sensitive information also justifies our conclusion. We
also cared the amount of reward for the participants, considering
the time to complete a task and minimum wage.
8 RELATED WORK
In this section, we discuss related work in terms of IDN homograph
detection methods and their measurement studies.
8.1 IDN Homograph Detection
Several studies have led to the proposal of methods to detect IDN
homographs. The approaches they followed are broadly classified
into two types: image-based and character-based.
Image-based IDN Homograph Detection As an IDN homograph
exploits the visual similarity between characters, it is natural to
apply image-based analysis for detecting these homographs. Liu et
al. [21] generated images corresponding to 1.4 million registered
IDNs and reference domain names extracted from the top 1,000 do-
main names listed on Alexa Top Sites. They then detected 1,516 IDN
homographs based on the visual similarities between images. Fur-
thermore, they found an additional 42,671 IDNs that were visually

similar to the reference domain names but were still unregistered.
Unfortunately, details of their detection methods and settings are
not provided in their paper. Sawabe et al. [30] developed a method
to detect IDN homographs by leveraging optical character recog-
nition (OCR). The method replaced non-ASCII characters in IDNs
with similar ASCII characters using OCR-based image recognition
and detected IDN homographs if the replaced IDNs corresponded
with reference domain names on Alexa Top Sites.
Character-based IDN Homograph Detection A few researchers
adopted the character-based approach. To the best of our knowl-
edge, only two previous studies [26, 37] attempted to apply this
approach. Quinkert et al. [26] searched IDN homographs based on
a list of homograph pairs, which is equivalent to the homoglyph
DB using UC in our study, and detected 2,984 IDN homographs
targeting 810 reference domain names. Tian et al. [37] developed
a detection method based on UC to identify IDN homographs. As
shown in Section 4, our homoglyph DB, SimChar outperformed UC-
based detection in the sense that the homoglyphs of SimChar were
perceived to be more confusing than those of UC while maintain-
ing high coverage of homoglyphs; thus, our method complements
previous work to cover IDN homographs more comprehensively.
8.2 Measurement Study of IDN Homograph
Attacks
Apart from the IDN homograph detection method described above,
several researchers have performed measurement studies of IDN ho-
mograph attacks in the wild. In 2006, Holgers et al. [15] conducted
a passive measurement study on a campus network to search for
IDN homographs accessed by users. They also used active DNS
probing to detect registered IDN homographs for a limited number
of reference domains. Tian et al. [37] studied domains created by
various types of domain squatting techniques including IDN homo-
graphs to detect phishing websites that exploit homographs in the
wild. Le Pochat et al. [24] defined the concept of IDNs that owners
of brands with diacritical marks would like to use and generated
15,276 such IDNs. They found that 43% of them were available
for registration in 2019. Chiba et al. [5] performed a measurement
study to demonstrate that there are many IDN homograph attacks
targeting non-English brands or combining other domain squatting
methods.
These previous studies mainly focused on the measurement
of IDN homographs. We believe our character-based approach to
comprehensively detect IDN homographs could be readily applied
to these studies, and thus could complement them to provide a
more comprehensive understanding of IDN homographs.
9 CONCLUSION
This work led to the development of a new framework named
ShamFinder, which is useful for detecting IDN homographs effi-
ciently. The key technical contribution of our work was the con-
struction of a new homoglyph database named SimChar, which
can be updated without requiring time-consuming manual efforts.
As SimChar is portable, it can be implemented in various sys-
tems/platforms as a key component of countermeasures against
the threat of IDN homograph attacks. Noteworthy is that SimChar
461
could be used for other promising security applications such as de-
tecting obfuscated plagiarism, which exploits Unicode homoglyphs.
We release the code and data of ShamFinder [32]. Our future work
includes the extension of our study; i.e., extending the domain
name space to be explored, extending the font sets, studying the
confusability of non-ASCII homoglyphs, etc.
