I was looking at the templating helper classes in FrameworkBundle and
SecurityBundle. There appears to be a fair about of code duplication between
these classes and their Twig extension counterparts.
I realize helpers extend a base class, as do Twig extensions, so separate
classes must continue to exist; however, we could use object composition to
have the Twig extensions expose the helper's methods to Twig. In some cases,
this might require an intermediary wrapping method in the helper.
