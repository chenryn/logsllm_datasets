While reviewing the templating helper classes in FrameworkBundle and SecurityBundle, I noticed a significant amount of code duplication between these classes and their corresponding Twig extensions.

I understand that both the helpers and the Twig extensions inherit from base classes, which necessitates the existence of separate classes. However, we could reduce redundancy by employing object composition. Specifically, we can have the Twig extensions expose the methods of the helper classes to the Twig environment. In some instances, this approach might require adding intermediary wrapper methods within the helper classes to ensure seamless integration.
