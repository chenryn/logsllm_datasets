### Title: BlackHat Asia-19: Zombie POODLE, GOLDENDOODLE, and How TLSv1.3 Can Save Us All

HTTPS is the cornerstone of online privacy and commerce. However, for two decades, the underlying TLS protocol has been subject to a series of piecemeal fixes rather than fundamental improvements. Instead of deprecating cryptographic techniques with known vulnerabilities, the TLSv1.2 specification includes a long list of workarounds, countermeasures, and caveats that must be carefully followed to prevent attacks. This is evident in the continued use of PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, RC4 encryption, and CBC mode ciphers in TLSv1.2.

In this session, we will present research on more effective testing and exploitation techniques for CBC padding oracles. We will reveal how a minor modification to the POODLE vulnerability led to its resurgence in a major enterprise HTTPS implementation, more than three years after it had been patched. Additionally, we will introduce GOLDENDOODLE, a specialized attack based on POODLE that can disclose session IDs significantly faster than the original POODLE attack. The GOLDENDOODLE attack also demonstrates that a previously unknown Cisco ASA CVE, thought not to affect confidentiality, can indeed reveal sensitive data, such as session cookies, to a network-based attacker.

This presentation will underscore the importance of adopting TLSv1.3, which addresses many of these long-standing issues and provides a more secure foundation for online communications.
