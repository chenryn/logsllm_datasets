This odd domain possesses millions of profiles of people associated with government and corporate 
employment. The data appears to have been scraped from Linkedln and search queries rely on a Google Custom 
Search Engine. Searching a company typically reveals all employees. My gut says this site will not be around 
long.
Open Payrolls might be the largest searchable nationwide government salary database consisting of nearly 85 
million salary’ records from over 14,800 employers. It allows you to locate employee salaries for federal agencies, 
states, counties, cities, universities, colleges, and K-12 schools. A direct query’ URL follows.
This grassroots watchdog network connects the dots between the world's most powerful people and 
organizations. Searching a name or company’ can reveal details associated with donations, political support, 
board members, and other relationships. The query’ URL follows.
This site claims to possess complete court documents for millions of bankruptcy’ cases. There is no search 
feature unless you create an account. The free tier is quite limited and will quickly’ restrict your searching. Instead, 
let's use Google to find what we need. The following search displayed links to 59 unredacted documents.
This self-described "global archive of research material for investigative reporting" includes numerous business 
records, transcripts, and other data sets. All can be filtered to display’ email addresses, phone numbers, names, 
and specific file types. Queries are free, but results might be limited if y’ou are not signed in with a free account

Black Book Online's Asset Locator is the most comprehensive list of sources for the search of real estate, 
judgments, bankruptcies, tax liens, and unclaimed funds. This page will allow you to select the type of asset you 
are researching and the state of the target. This wall then create a new page with all the options for that state. It 
will provide direct links to the sites for a search of the target. This often includes online databases of public 
employee salaries, vehicle registrations, property’ tax records, and dozens of other categories.
Social Security Death Index (genealogybank.com/explore/ssdi/all)
This public index of death records is stored on a genealogy' site. The only’ required information is the first and 
last name. The results will identify birth year, death year, state of last residence, and state of SSN issue.
Many people assume that information related to vehicle registration and licensing is only available to law 
enforcement through internal networks. While a full driver's license search and complete license plate query’ is 
not publicly available, a surprising portion of related data is online for anyone to view. The following methods 
will display all publicly available details.
The elections of 2016 and 2020 caused a lot of controversy’ in regard to the use and collection of voter 
registration data. While these personal details are public record, many’ people did not believe it was appropriate 
for politicians to use this personal data as a part of their campaign strategies. Regardless of your opinion on 
these matters, much of the voter registration details are available online. The most beneficial site I have found 
is Voter Records (voterrecords.com). You can search by’ name or browse by’ state. Any results will identify full 
name, home address, mailing address, gender, party’ affiliation, age, and relatives. Currendy, databases are 
available for Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Washington.
A simple way to verify if a social security number is valid is at SSN Validator. This does not provide the personal 
information attached to the number, only verification that the number is valid. A ty’pical response will include 
the state that issued the number, the year issued, verification that the number was assigned, and confirmation of 
death if applicable.
There are many’ websites that search for death-related information such as social security’ indexes and ancestry’ 
records. A leader in this area is Legacy’. This site indexes online obituaries and memorials from approximately’ 
80 percent of all online newspapers. The search on this site is straightforward and results can identify family’ 
members and locations.

The DOT has a website which provides free access to vehicle identification number (VIN) data. All information 
on this website is public information, and the data comes from vehicle manufacturers. You can search by VIN 
within their database to find detailed vehicle information. I submitted a unique VIN and received the following 
response.

The following options also allow you to enter any VIN and retrieve the year, make, and model of the vehicle 
associated. The first option will often display estimated mileage based on service records.
Several free seances identify the year, make, and model of a vehicle after supplying the VIN. However, it is more 
likely that we know the license plate registration details rather than a VIN. Fortunately, we have many options 
for researching these plates. The following sendees provide a search option based on the vehicle registration 
plate and state. Results are hit-or-miss, and rarefy include a name, but many' will identify' the VIN for further 
research.
While the previous searches will identify' details about vehicles, they will not display' any' information about theft 
or salvage records. The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) allows a search of any' VIN and will display 
two unique pieces of information. The VINCheck Theft Record will identify' vehicles that have been reported 
stolen, while the VINCheck Total Loss Records identifies VINs that belong to salvaged vehicles.
VINs from motorcycles may not be searchable on standard VIN engines due to the number of characters in 
them. Cycle VIN will display' a year and make, as well as any' indication that the VIN exists in its proprietary­
database. If it does, S25 will obtain title and mileage information. I only' use this as a free resource for verifying 
motorcycle VINs to the correct y'ear and make.

When I searched the same plate on VinCheck, I received a VIN of 3GTEK13Y87G527460.1 now have a decent

While only a small piece of information, this works in conjunction with other search techniques. After exhausting 
all of these searches, you should be able to obtain the VIN, make, model, year, engine, and style of the vehicle. 
These options will not typically provide the name of the owner.
While not an official vehicle search, the insurance provider Progressive offers an interesting piece of information. 
I first learned about this technique from S.L., a member of my online OSINT forum. When you view the home 
page at progressive.com, you are prompted to request a free insurance quote. If you provide the zip code and 
address of any target, you receive a summary of the year, make, and model of all vehicles registered at that 
address. You can supply any random data besides the physical address and receive the results. This was likely 
designed to make the quote process more efficient and accurate, but investigators should appreciate the free 
utility’.
While the previous license plate search websites offer a straight-forward query option, they are limited to the 
data available within publicly-traded vehicle databases. California plates often reveal accurate data, but states 
such as South Dakota and Montana are not as generous with the sharing of their own registrations. Because of 
this, we may want to query’ services which pay a fee in order to access premium data sets. My favorite of these 
is Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com/instant-cash-offer). The premise of this site is to identify the value of your own 
vehicle and potentially receive an offer to purchase it from KBB. That may have a benefit to you, but I prefer 
to harness the OSINT capabilities of this service.
If the previous search options fail to identify the VIN, year, make, and model of a vehicle based on the license 
plate, tty’ O'Reilly. As a service to potential customers, it allows you to enter your license plate in order to identify 
applicable parts for your vehicle. Select the "Shop by Vehicle" in the upper-right and enter the license plate and 
state. 1 provided the state of California and the plate of "HACKER". I received the following response.
As a test, I submitted a vehicle's registration number which was displayed on a television show playing in the 
background while I wrote this section. The result correcdy identified the vehicle as a 2010 Dodge Avenger. This 
example was a California plate, so I felt like I was cheating a bit. Instead, I conducted a search of the license 
plate "MRB1G" within South Dakota and Wyoming, which are both known to protect vehicle registration data 
from public view. The results appear below.

Any contributions to political campaigns are public record. Searching this is now easy thanks to three separate 
websites. These sites will search using information as minimal as a last name. Including the full name and year 
will proride many details about the target. This includes occupation, the recipient of the contribution, the 
amount, the type of contribution, and a link to the official filing that contains the information. After an initial 
search is conducted, you will receive additional search tabs that will allow you to filter by zip code, occupation, 
and year. Melissa Data allows you to search a zip code and identify all political donations for a specified year. 
The results from these sites may be redundant, but often contain unique data.
There is an abundance of details available about global marine traffic within ownership records and real-time 
monitoring. Marine Traffic (marinetraffic.com) prorides an interactive map that displays the current location of 
all registered ships and boats. Clicking on any vessel provides the name, speed, collection time, and destination. 
Boat Info World (boatinfoworld.com) allows the search of a boat name and provides the following details.
Monitoring aircraft during flight and searching historical ownership records is relatively' easy. Commercial planes 
constandy announce their location with automated reporting systems and tail numbers act similarly to a vehicle's 
registration plate. Today, this information is publicly' available on multiple websites. Plane Finder 
(planefinder.net) displays an interactive global map identifying all known aircraft currently' in flight. Hovering 
over a selection displays the carrier, flight number, originating departure, destination, speed, and altitude. 
Historical ownership records are available on multiple websites and none are completely' accurate. 1 recommend 
Black Book Online's aviation page (www.blackbookoniine.info/Aviation-Public-Records.aspx). At the rime of 
this writing, it provided direct links to the following databases.
This website requires a last name, social security' number, and date of birth of the target. The result will identify 
the person's full name, selective service number, and date of registration.

While not technically government data, I felt that this option fits best in this chapter. This website will allow you 
to enter the first six digits of any credit card number and identify the brand, issuing bank, card type, card level, 
country, bank website, and customer care line.
High Programmer (liighprogrammer.com/cgi-bin/uniqueid)
Most states use some type of algorithm to create a driver's license number for a person. Often, this number is 
generated from the person's name, sex, and date of birth. After you have determined your target's middle initial 
and date of birth from the previous websites mentioned, you can use this data to identify the target s driver s 
license number. High Programmer will automate this process for the following states:
Both federal and state prisons offer prisoner details online. The amount of detail will vary by state, but most will 
include photographs of the target and details of the crime. In most states, this information is maintained in 
public view after the target is released, if the subject is still on probation or parole. Federal prisoners can be 
located at www.bop.gov/inmateloc. A first and last name is required for a search. Each state maintains its own 
database of prisoner information. Conducting a search on Google of "Inmate locator" plus the state of interest 
should present official search options for diat state.
This is one of the leading sites in identifying public criminal information about sex offenders. The main page 
includes a "Find Offender" tab. You can search here by address or name. The name search only requires a last 
name to display results. This will identify’ registered sex offenders that match the criteria specified. This will 
include a photograph of the target and details of the offense.
Real World Application: While working in the homicide division, I often identified credit or debit card 
numbers of my victims. If the actual card was located, I did not need this senrice. However, if only the number 
was located, this senrice helped to identify’ the financial institution and a contact number. In one specific 
investigation, I had learned that the victim had eaten at a local restaurant the evening prior to her suspicious 
death. Visiting the restaurant allowed me to acquire the debit card that she used for payment Searching this 
number through BinDB identified the issuing bank. Calling presented an automated self-senrice feature for 
members of that bank. Entering the newly found debit card number and the zip code of the victim allowed me 
to access the previous 30 days of charges to her account. This identified an unknown ATM withdrawal on the 
day of her killing. Retrieving video from that ATM machine displayed a passenger in her vehicle. This initiated 
a new investigation which eventually led to the killer.

Every’ scanner broadcast is recorded at all times. A paid membership provides access to these archives. This has 
been a huge benefit to my investigations. I can go back in time to hear the original dispatch and all follow-up 
radio transmissions. Even better, 1 can do this without a subpoena or FOIA request. I have been a scanner 
enthusiast for much of my’ life, but this takes everything to a new level. In the early’ 90's, I would have never 
suspected that 1 could hear all frequencies at any time and "rewind" communications from anywhere.
VINELink is an online portal to VINE, a victim notification network. VINE has been providing victims and 
concerned citizens with information for decades, allowing individuals to access reliable information about 
custody’ status changes and criminal case information. After choosing the state of interest, you can select from 
the following options.
Warning: Every' city, county’, state, and country’ reports criminal matters uniquely. While you may find 
something of interest through traditional OSINT resources, absence of online criminal information does not 
indicate that a crime was not committed. More often than not, I cannot locate online information about a known 
crime or criminal. These resources should be considered secondary’ to a detailed inquiry’ through the courts or 
law enforcement.
Find an Offender Get info and register to be notified of custody’ status changes.
Find an Offender Court Case: Get info and register to be notified of offender court dates.
Find Sex Offender Registry’ Status: Get info about sex offender registry’ status changes.
Find a Protective Order: Get info and register to be notified of protective order status changes.
These sites have been a steady part of my arsenal for over a decade. Broadcastify allows you to listen to live 
and archived streams of radio traffic from emergency’ personnel while Radio Reference is the most robust 
database of known radio frequencies for these transmissions. Each site complements the other, so let's dissect 
both of them.
A premium membership to both sites is $30 annually. This provides commercial-free listening; non-stop 
streaming; access to archives; custom listening templates; and programming functions through scanner software. 
The free tier allows limited streaming with commercials and manual query’ of frequencies. I know many people 
who get by’ with the free version. The first time you need access to the archives, the cost of membership will 
likely' be justified. This service allows journalists to play' dispatch recordings without waiting on a public release 
from a government agency’.
Broadcastify’ is the largest platform of live streaming audio from public safety’, aircraft, rail, and marine related 
communications in the United States. It was originally hosted on Radio Reference's site. From the "Listen" > 
"Browse Feeds" menu, you can drill down through states and counties to select y’our area of interest. From 
there, you rely on the willingness of internet strangers to share their audio feeds to the world. I can be in Los 
Angeles and listen to a stranger's police scanner monitoring frequencies in Chicago. I confess that on occasion, 
I listen to the police department which hired me in the 9O's to hear what my’ former colleagues are doing. If you 
are investigating any’ event in real-time, this can be a wonderful free service. For me, the power is in the archives.
Radio Reference identifies frequencies for local monitoring. You can drill down through y’our state and county 
to reveal all police, fire, and other frequencies. These can then be programmed into y’our own hardware for live 
monitoring. This is beneficial if a specific stream of audio is not available through Broadcastify. Many software 
applications which support various police scanners can connect to this database for easy’ programming. I rely 
on my Uniden BCD396XT receiver programmed by’ ProScan (proscan.org) software, retrieving data from Radio 
Reference. I can program any local frequencies to my unit within minutes while I am conducting a remote 
investigation.
