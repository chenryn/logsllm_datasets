User: I have a virtualenv in a structure like this:
venv/
  src/
    project_files
I want to run a makefile (which calls out to Python) in the project_files, but I want to run it from a virtual environment. Because of the way my deployment orchestration works, I can't simply do a source venv/bin/activate. 
Instead, I've tried to export PYTHONPATH={project_path}/venv/bin/python2.7. When I try to run the makefile, however, the python scripts aren't finding the dependencies installed in the virtualenv. Am I missing something obvious?
Assistant: You can actually just call the Python interpreter in your virtual environment. So, in your Makefile, instead of calling python, call venv/bin/python.
