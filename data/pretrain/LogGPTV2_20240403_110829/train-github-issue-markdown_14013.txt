Above is from @smarterclayton. Discussed something similar with @thockin and
@bgrant0607 a while back.
I understand what we want to do, but lack the technical design to make it
happen.
How does a pod/volume communicate what kind of "slot" is consumes? Is this all
contained in the scheduler (it is counting all resources consumed and placed)?
Where do the rules go (e.g, 16 GCE disks per node)?
Feedback is requested, please.
