**Glide Version**: 3.7.0  
**Integration Libraries**: `glideOkHttpVersion = '1.4.0'`  
**Device/Android Version**: Nexus 5X, Android 6.0.1

I am attempting to save cached images using the following code:

```java
builder.setDiskCache(() -> {
    final File cacheLocation = new File(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES), ALBUM);
    if (!cacheLocation.mkdirs()) {
        Timber.d("Directory not created");
    }
    return DiskLruCacheWrapper.get(cacheLocation, CACHE_SIZE);
});
```

My question is: Is it possible to set a naming policy for the cached images? Currently, the images are saved with filenames like `xxxxxxx.o`, and I would like them to have a `.jpg` or `.png` extension so that they can be displayed in the Gallery app.

I am trying to save cached images using the following configuration:

```java
builder.setDiskCache(() -> {
    final File cacheLocation = new File(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES), ALBUM);
    if (!cacheLocation.mkdirs()) {
        Timber.d("Directory not created");
    }
    return DiskLruCacheWrapper.get(cacheLocation, CACHE_SIZE);
});
```

My question is: Is it possible to define a custom naming policy for the cached images? Currently, the images are saved with filenames like `xxxxxxx.o`. I would like these images to have a `.jpg` or `.png` extension so that they can be recognized and displayed in the Gallery app.
