I'm trying to save cached images like:
    builder.setDiskCache(() -> {
                final File cacheLocation = new File(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES), ALBUM);
                if (!cacheLocation.mkdirs()) {
                    Timber.d("Directory not created");
                }
                return DiskLruCacheWrapper.get(cacheLocation, CACHE_SIZE);
            });
and the question is, if I could set the name policy for cached images, because
now they are saved as `xxxxxxx.o` and I would like to see all those cached
images in Gallery App, so that means that they should have an `jpg` of `png`
