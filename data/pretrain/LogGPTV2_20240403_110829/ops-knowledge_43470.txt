I am experiencing difficulties loading fixtures on Google App Engine (GAE) using google-app-engine-django. The error message I receive is: "DeserializationError: Invalid model identifier: 'fcl.User'".

### Command Used
```bash
./manage.py loaddata users
```

### Fixture Data
The fixture I'm trying to load contains the following data:

```yaml
- model: fcl.User
  fields:
    firstname: test
    lastname: testerson
    email: test@example.com
    user_id: '981167207188616462253'
    status: active
    usertype: player
    creationtime: '2010-08-29 00:00:00'
```

### File Locations
- **Fixture**: `fcl/fixtures/users.yaml`
- **Model**: `fcl/models.py`

### Question
Do I need to qualify my model name in any other way? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

### Solution
After further investigation, I discovered that the issue was due to an incorrect declaration of my model in `models.py`. When using google-app-engine-django, each model should be a subclass of `appengine_django.db.BaseModel`.

Here is the corrected model definition:

```python
from appengine_django.db import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    # Define your model fields here
    firstname = db.StringProperty()
    lastname = db.StringProperty()
    email = db.EmailProperty()
    user_id = db.StringProperty()
    status = db.StringProperty()
    usertype = db.StringProperty()
    creationtime = db.DateTimeProperty()
```

Additionally, I needed to include a valid primary key (`pk`) in my fixture. Here is the updated fixture:

```yaml
- model: fcl.User
  pk: 1
  fields:
    firstname: test
    lastname: testerson
    email: test@example.com
    user_id: '981167207188616462253'
    status: active
    usertype: player
    creationtime: '2010-08-29 00:00:00'
```

After making these changes, the fixture loaded successfully.
