### Appendix

#### A. The Scanning Mechanism of Touchscreens

As discussed in Section VIII-B, there are two main types of scanning mechanisms used by modern touchscreens: sequential driving and parallel driving. As demonstrated in GhostTouch [12], recent touchscreen attacks rely on the synchronization of sequential driving signals to inject precise touch events. However, this approach is limited to sequential scanning type touchscreens. Figure A-1 illustrates the significant differences in scanning signals from various test devices we own. We found that the latest touchscreen devices commonly use the parallel driving method, rendering synchronization-based attacks infeasible. Even with the sequential driving method, different types of touchscreens can exhibit significantly different patterns. In contrast, our attack does not depend on any particular scanning method to function.

#### B. Derivation of Equations of IEMI Frequency

We assume that the electric field generated by the radiated IEMI is sinusoidal. The noise current \( I_n \) in Fig. 8a is given as follows:

\[ I_n = 2\pi f_E C_M V_n \cos(2\pi f_E \cdot t + \phi_0) \]

where \( f_E \) is the E-field frequency and \( \phi_0 \) is the phase between \( I_n \) and the S2 control signal in Fig. 8b. The waveforms show the control signal of S2 and the noise current caused by IEMI over one period. The output voltage variation \( V_{Tn} \) caused by the IEMI can then be calculated as follows:

\[ V_{Tn} = -\frac{2\pi f_E C_M V_n}{C_s} \int_0^{T_s} \cos(2\pi f_E \cdot t + \phi_0) dt \]

where \( T_s \) is the sensing time. Following (B-2), the \( V_{Tn} \) at the end of the sensing period can be calculated as:

\[ V_{Tn} = -\frac{C_M V_n}{C_s} (\sin(2\pi f_E \cdot T_s + \phi_0) - \sin(\phi_0)) \]

During the IEMI injection period, \( V_{Tn} \) is compared to the threshold \( V_{th} \). The control signal of the QT sensor is a periodic signal whose frequency depends on the system clock frequency. Specifically, the sensing time \( T_s \) depends on the QT sensor switching frequency \( f_{sw} \) and the duty cycle \( D_s \):

\[ T_s = \frac{D_s}{f_{sw}} \]

Substituting (B-4) into (B-3), we get a more precise way to compute \( V_{Tn} \) as shown in (B-5):

\[ V_{Tn} = -\frac{C_M V_n}{C_s} \left( \sin \left( 2\pi \cdot \frac{D_s \cdot f_E}{f_{sw}} + \phi_0 \right) - \sin(\phi_0) \right) \]

From (B-5), it is clear that \( V_{Tn} \) depends on the ratio of the IEMI signal frequency to the QT sensor operating frequency. The higher \( |V_{Tn}| \) is, the more significant the IEMI impact. Based on this observation, the minimum interference occurs at \( f_{Emin} \), which can be calculated as follows:

\[ f_{Emin} = k \frac{f_{sw}}{D_s}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \]

where \( k \) is an integer. When \( f_E = f_{Emin} \), \( V_{Tn} \) in (B-5) is always zero, indicating no interference. The maximum interference, on the other hand, depends on the frequency of the IEMI signal and the phase shift \( \phi_0 \).

With the analysis in Section IV-D, we know that the output voltage of the QT sensor is usually compared with the threshold voltage every few clock cycles. Combining (8) and (B-5), the sum of output voltage variation over \( M \) cycles, \( V_{TnM} \), is given as follows:

\[ V_{TnM} = -\frac{C_M V_n}{C_s} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \left( \sin(2\pi f_E \cdot T_s + \phi_m) - \sin(\phi_m) \right) \]

where \( \phi_m \) can be calculated as:

\[ \phi_m = \phi_0 + 2\pi m \cdot \frac{f_E}{f_{sw}} \]

Based on (B-7) and (B-8), we can calculate \( f_E \) so that the initial phase shift between \( I_n \) and the S2 control signal remains constant in each sensing duty cycle (see Fig. 8b). The calculation of \( f_E \) is shown below:

\[ f_E = n f_{sw}, \quad n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \]

#### C. Derivation of Equations of IEMI Field Strength

A more detailed characterization of the E-field interference is presented as follows. In Fig. 6a, \( E_Z \) is the z-component of the external E-field, which generates voltage \( V_n \) across the touchscreen electrodes. \( V_n \) can be calculated as:

\[ V_n = E_Z \cdot d \]

where \( d \) is the distance between the electrodes. The charges \( Q_n \) caused by the external E-field can be derived as:

\[ Q_n = V_n \cdot C_M \]

where \( C_M \) represents the mutual capacitance between the electrodes, which can be computed as:

\[ C_M = \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r A}{d} \]

where \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, \( \epsilon_r \) is the relative permittivity of the adhesive layer, and \( A \) is the overlap area of the electrodes. From (C-10) to (C-12), we can derive \( E_Z \), the z-component of the external E-field:

\[ E_Z = \frac{Q_n}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r A} = \frac{V_n C_M}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r A} \]

Based on superposition theory, the voltage \( V_{cN} \) added to the input of the integrator in Fig. 6b can be computed as:

\[ V_{cN} = V_c + V_n \]

where \( V_c \) is the voltage of \( C_M \) due to \( V_{in} \). The output voltage \( V_{oN} \) under the external E-field's interference is, therefore, as follows:

\[ V_{oN} = -\frac{C_M}{C_s} (V_c + V_n) = V_o + V_{Tn} \]
