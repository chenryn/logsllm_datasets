APPENDIX
A. The scanning mechanism of touchscreens
As we explained in Section VIII-B, there are two type
of scanning mechanism mainly used by modern touchscreen,
sequential driving method and parallel driving method. As
shown in Ghosttouch [12], this most recent touchscreen attack
relies on the synchronization of sequential driving signal
to precisely inject touch events. However, such approach
limits the attack to sequential scanning type touchscreen. As
illustrated in Figure A-1, the scanning signal from the test
devices we own are significantly different. We further find
that latest touchscreen devices commonly use parallel driving
method instead, which makes the synchronization based attack
no longer feasible. Even with the sequential driving method,
different type of touchscreen can show significantly different
pattern. On the contrary, our attack does not reply on any
particular scanning method of touchscreen to work.
B. Derivation of Equations of IEMI frequency
We assume that the electric field generated by the radiated
IEMI is sinusoidal. The noise current, In in Fig. 8a, is given
as follows.
In = 2πfECMVn cos (2πfE · t + φ0)
(B-1)
where fE is the E field frequency and φ0 is the phase between
In and S2 control signal in Fig. 8b. The waveforms show the
control signal of S2 and the noise current caused by IEMI in
one period. The output voltage variation VT n caused by the
IEMI can then be calculated as follows.
VT n = −2πfECMV n
Cs
 Ts
0
· cos (2πfE · t + φ0)dt
(B-2)
where Ts is the sensing time. Following (B-2), the VT n at the
end of the sensing period can be calculated as follows.
VT n = −CMV n
Cs
(sin(2πfE · Ts + φ0) − sin (φ0))
(B-3)
During the IEMI injection period, VT n is compared to the
threshold Vth. The control signal of the QT sensor is a peri-
odical signal whose frequency depends on the system clock
frequency. More specifically, the sensing time Ts depends on
the QT sensor switching frequency fsw and the duty cycle Ds.
Ts = Ds
fsw
(B-4)
When we substitute (B-4) to (B-3), we have a more precise
way to compute the VT n as shown in (B-5).
VT n = −CMV n
Cs
sin
2π · Ds · fE
fsw
+ φ0
− sin (φ0)
(B-5)
From (B-5), it is clear that VT n depends on the ratio of the
IEMI signal frequency over the QT sensor operating frequency.
The higher |VT n| is, the more significant the IEMI impact.
Based on this observation, we can conclude that the minimum
interference occurs at fEmin, which can be calculated as
follows.
fEmin = kfsw
Ds
k = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .
(B-6)
where k is an integer. When fE = fEmin, VT n in (B-5)
is always zero, which indicates that there is no interference.
The maximum interference, on the other hand, depends on the
frequency of the IEMI signal as well as the phase shift φ0.
With the analysis in Section IV-D, we know that the output
voltage of QT sensor is usually compared with the threshold
voltage every few clock cycles. So combining (8) and (B-5),
the sum of output voltage variation of M cycles, VT nM, is
given as follows.
VT nM = −CMVn
Cs
M
0
(sin(2πfE · Ts + φM) − sin (φM))
(B-7)
where φM can be calculated in (B-8).
φM = φ0 + 2πM · fE
fsw
(B-8)
Based on (B-7) and (B-8), we can calculate fE so that the
initial phase shift between In and S2 control signal remains
constant in each sensing duty cycle (see Fig. 8 (b)). The
calculation of fE is shown below.
fE = nfsw
n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .
(B-9)
C. Derivation of Equations of IEMI Field Strength
A more detailed characterization of the E field interference
is presented as follows. In Fig. 6a, EZ is the z component
of the external E field, which generates voltage Vn across the
touch screen electrodes. Vn can be calculated in (C-10).
Vn =
EZ · dl = EZ · d
(C-10)
where d is the distance between the electrodes. The charges
(Qn) caused by the external E field can be derived as follows.
Qn = Vn · CM
(C-11)
where CM represents the mutual capacitance between the
electrodes. It can be computed in (C-12).
CM = ε0εr

where ε0 is the permittivity of the free space and εr is the
relative permittivity of the adhesive layer. A is the overlap
area of the electrodes. From (C-10) ± (C-12), we can derive
EZ, the z component of the external E field.

Based on superposition theory, the voltage VcN which is added
to the input of the integrator in Fig. 6b can be computed as
follows.
VcN = Vc + Vn
(C-14)
where Vc is the voltage of CM due to Vin. The output voltage,
VoN, under the external E field’s interference is, therefore, as
follows.
VoN = −CM
