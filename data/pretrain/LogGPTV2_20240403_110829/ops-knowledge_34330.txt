It seems you are experiencing issues specifically with Python 3.5 and 3.6 on your Windows 7 system, while Python 2.7 is working fine. Here are several methods to resolve the problem:

1. **Run as Administrator:**
   - Right-click on the Python executable file (e.g., `python-3.7.0.exe`) and select "Run as administrator."
   
2. **Command Prompt in Administrator Mode:**
   - Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
   - Navigate to the directory where the Python setup file is located using the `cd` command. For example:
     ```cmd
     cd C:\Users\ABC\Downloads
     ```
   - Run the installation with the `TargetDir` parameter to specify the installation directory. For instance:
     ```cmd
     python-3.7.0.exe TargetDir=C:\Python37
     ```

3. **Custom Installation:**
   - Choose a custom installation during the setup process.
   - Select a clean folder location for the installation.
   - Customize the installation by ticking or un-ticking options. Only select the necessary components and leave the rest unchecked. This can sometimes help in resolving installation issues.

4. **Change Ownership and Compatibility Settings:**
   - Right-click on the Python setup file and go to its properties.
   - In the "Security" tab, change the owner to the administrator.
   - Go to the "Compatibility" tab and check the box for "Run this program as an administrator."

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install Python 3.5 or 3.6 on your Windows 7 system.
