### Kcek: Key for Decrypting the Encrypted Content

**Algorithm 3: Key-Generation (Rand, EK)**
- **Input:**
  - `Rand`: Random number
  - `EK`: Encrypted key
- **Output:**
  - `Kcek`: Decryption key

**Steps:**
1. `Kc := A8(Ki, Rand);`
2. `UK := AUK(Kc, Rand);`
3. `Kcek := DEUK(EK);`

### Algorithm 4: Content-Decryption (License, En Content)
- **Input:**
  - `License`: License for decrypting the content
  - `En Content`: Encrypted content
- **Output:**
  - `Content`: Decrypted content

**Steps:**
1. `Flag := Check License(License)Agent;`
2. If `Flag == True` then:
   - `License ID := GetID(License)Agent;`
   - `Rand := GetRand(License)Agent;`
   - `Rights := GetRights(License)Agent;`
   - `EK := GetEK(License)Agent;`
   - `Hash := H(HKey(cid:3)License ID(cid:3)Rights)Agent;`
3. If it is the first time:
   - `CreateLSW(License ID, Rand, Hash)SIM;`
   - `Kcek := Key-Generation(Rand, EK)SIM;`
4. Else:
   - If `CheckLSW(License ID, Rand, Hash)SIM` then:
     - `Kcek := Key-Generation(Rand, EK)SIM;`
   - Else:
     - `error := ErrorInfo("License is unavailable");`
     - `return := GenerateMessage(error)Agent;`
5. `Content := DEKcek(En Content)Agent;`
6. `UpdateLSW(License ID, Rand, Hash)SIM;`
7. Else:
   - `error := ErrorInfo("License is unavailable");`
   - `return := GenerateMessage(error)Agent;`

### Explanation of Operations
- The SIM card creates a corresponding LSW.
- The SIM card generates `Kcek` using Algorithm 3 and sends it to the DRM agent.
- The DRM agent decrypts the content using `Kcek` in the secure memory of the device.
- The subscript of the operation (e.g., `SIM`, `Agent`) indicates the entity where the operation is executed.

### 4. Case Study

#### 4.1. Preparation Phase
- **Content Upload:**
  - Content providers upload content to a content server using SSL protocols.
- **Key Generation and Encryption:**
  - The content server generates `Kcek` and encrypts the digital content using symmetric encryption.
  - The content server hosts the encrypted content for users to download.
- **Transmission to License Server:**
  - The content server transmits `Content ID`, `IContent ID`, and `Kcek` to the license server in the format `EPKls(Content ID(cid:3)Kcek(cid:3)IContent ID)`, where `EPKIs` is an asymmetric encryption operation using the public key `PKls` of the license server.
  - `Content ID` is a unique identifier consisting of a local content identifier and the corresponding content provider identifier.
  - `IContent ID` contains rights description information such as price and play type.
- **Storage and Web Page Generation:**
  - The license server stores `Kcek`, `Content ID`, and `IContent ID`.
  - The license server generates a rights customization web page hosted on the license server.
  - The license server transmits `Content ID` and the URL of the corresponding rights customization web page to the content server.

#### 4.2. Rights Customization Phase
- **User Interaction:**
  - The user browses the content server website and selects the desired content.
- **DRM Agent Check:**
  - The DRM agent searches for a license with the `Content ID` suffix in the device.
  - If a corresponding license is found, it checks the license against LSW using `License ID`.
  - If the license is not correct or the rights are unavailable, the rights customization phase begins.
- **Rights Customization:**
  - The DRM agent requests the URL of the rights customization web page from the content server.
  - The browser acquires the rights customization web page from the license server and renders it.
  - The user customizes the rights and confirms the selected rights information.
  - The trigger message `TM` (Content ID, License ID, rights, license url) is generated and sent by the license server.
- **Storage of Rights Information:**
  - After the user affirms `TM`, the license server stores the rights information for generating a license later.

#### 4.3. License Acquisition Phase
- **Random Number Generation:**
  - The DRM agent generates a random number `Rand` and passes it to the SIM card for calculating `Kc` and `CK` used for SIM card authentication.
  - The DRM agent combines `Rand`, `IMSI hash`, `Rights ID`, and `CK` as a request and transmits it to the license server.
- **License Server Verification:**
  - The license server checks if `CK` is equal to the calculated `CK*` using `Rand` and `IMSI hash`.
  - If they match, the SIM card is authenticated, and the license server creates a license.
- **License and LSW Management:**
  - Upon receiving the license for the first time, the DRM agent creates LSW in the SIM card.
  - The corresponding license and LSW are updated after the license is consumed.
  - The upload phase is launched to synchronize licenses and LSW with the license server when the user starts the CS-DRM client.
- **Payment:**
  - The SIM card handles the payment after the user receives the license.
  - The license server checks the user account before the purchase.
  - The SIM card sends proactive commands to the mobile operator's system for payment.

#### 4.4. Play Phase
- **Initiation:**
  - The play phase starts when the DRM agent gets a correct license with the `Content ID` suffix.
- **Key Generation:**
  - The DRM agent extracts `Rand` and `Hash` from the license and checks `Hash` with LSW in the SIM card.
  - If they match, the DRM agent sends `Rand`, `EK`, and `License ID` to the SIM card for generating `Kcek`.
- **Content Decryption:**
  - The DRM agent decrypts the encrypted content using `Kcek`.
  - The decrypted content is rendered by the player and stored in the secure memory of the mobile device.
- **Rights Update:**
  - When the user stops playing, `Kcek` and the decrypted content are deleted.
  - The DRM agent updates the rights information in the license and the LSW in the SIM card.
- **Error Handling:**
  - If the rights information is unavailable, the DRM agent deletes the license and notifies the SIM card to delete LSW.

#### 4.5. Download/Upload Phase
- **Download Phase:**
  - If a user inserts a SIM card into another device without the content and license, the user can select "Download License" to download the license from the license server.
  - The DRM agent checks the new license against the LSW in the SIM card. If the verification fails, the new license is deleted.
- **Upload Phase:**
  - The upload phase is launched when the user starts the CS-DRM client.
  - The SIM card sends proactive commands to synchronize the license and LSW with the license server.

### 5. Characteristics of CS-DRM

#### 5.1. Security Analysis
- **Utilization of SIM Card and LSW:**
  - The security of the proposed CS-DRM scheme is enhanced by the use of the SIM card and LSW.
  - The SIM card supports SSL over USB for secure communications between the SIM card and external applications.
- **Cloud Security:**
  - While cloud security is important, it is not the focus of this paper. Many commercial cloud solutions, such as GAE, have their own security principles.
- **SIM Card Security:**
  - The SIM card is secure enough to store `Ki` and other important information due to its robust security features.
