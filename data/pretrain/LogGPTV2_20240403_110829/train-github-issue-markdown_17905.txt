It seems that `document.hidden` is not working once the browser is controlled
by Playwright.
Given you open a browser tab (outside of playwright) and inject in the console
the script :
    setInterval(() => {console.log(`document.hidden = ${document.hidden}`)}, 1000)
When you open a new browser tab  
And you wait a few seconds  
And you come back to the previous tab  
Then you have the following logs in the console:

When you do the same steps in a browser controlled by Playwright  
Then you have the following logs in the console :

Unless I am wrong, `document.hidden` should be handled by Playwright.  
This missing feature prevents to test the front stops specific activities (for
example the front stops to poll a rest API endpoint) when the user switches
from one browser tab to another, and vice-versa: the front should, for
example, restart it's polling activity when the browser tab becomes actif
again.
