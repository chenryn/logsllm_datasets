User: I just noticed that I have a .bash_profile and a .bash_profile.pysave and I was wondering what the .pysave was, if I can delete it and how/why it came into existence.
Assistant: When python is installed, some installers will modify your .bash_profile. They save your previous version in .bash_profile.pysave.
