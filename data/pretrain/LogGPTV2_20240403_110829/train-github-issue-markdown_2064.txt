### What problem does this feature solve?
Both I and a colleague have spent hours debugging issues caused by having two
refs with the same name. Two cases where this can happen:
  1. Simple stupidity:
  2. Not realizing that refs don't seem to work in a v-for:
In this case, it is reasonable to assume the ref would work correctly because
there will only be one "fubar" component instantiated assuming 'titles' has no
duplicates. But the ref does not work right, either because ref ignores "v-if"
or because ref doesn't work right in v-for.
### What does the proposed API look like?
Simply issue a Vue warning when multiple refs with the same name are
encountered.
