User: I have installed libffi on my Linux server as well as correctly set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the correct directory, as pip recognizes that it is installed; however, when trying to install pyOpenSSL, pip states that it cannot find file 'ffi.h'. I know both thatffi.h exists as well as its directory, so how do I go about closing this gap between ffi.h and pip?
Assistant: You need to install the development package for libffi.
On RPM based systems (Fedora, Redhat, CentOS etc) the package is named libffi-devel.
Not sure about Debian/Ubuntu systems, I'm sure someone else will pipe up with that.
