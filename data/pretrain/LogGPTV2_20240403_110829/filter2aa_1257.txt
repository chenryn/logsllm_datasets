Good Start to Stop Tracking.
• Current ways to stop this !!!! 
• Ad Blocking Apps 
• AD Blackhole. (Less detectable)
• Track me not. https://adnauseam.io/
• Trackthis Hypervisor!!!
• EFF !!! Privacy Badger
• Paid VPNS *Static VPS*
• All A Good Start.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST ADS WESTON.
• I understand the internet costs money to run.
• I gladly pay for email.
• Gladly pay for YouTube RED
• Gladly pay for anything that’s AD Free.
• Even android Stuff You can click don’t track
Me and erase locations.
Disable tracking in browsers. Still does nothing
Drive by attacks malicious advertisements.
Explanation of Brick and mortar tracking.
• Since the late 90s stores have used one form or another of tracking. 
• Customers are tracked to provide analytics of where they go in the store so 
that stores can adjust the store layout to sell the most.
• There has been stories that come to light every few years that make 
references to big brother. But they are soon forgotten
• The stores remove the system or only had them in a piolet store so they 
cease expansion into other stores
• If people stop complaining they will make this a staple mark of there 
stores.
• There have been improvements to include most cases where customers 
have to OPT into the store rewards programs. 
Frequency ranges and Devices that use them.
• Bluetooth, Cellular beacons, Wifi, Infrared and motion.
• Several years they have gotten negative press by adding instore 
tracking
• US there has been lots of resistance with most forms of tracking.
• Apple and several other manufactures modify there Bluetooth 
beacons to protect users. 
• UK and other areas of the world there has been less resistance.
• We are told it is all turned into meta data (Data about data)
How Meta Data Affects Advertising and Monitoring.
• Meta Data is Used to Change Store Layout.
• More Specific Layout/Increase Sales
• Use of Rewards Programs OPT-in for Discounts
• Ads are Generated Off of Online Analytics.
• They Can Increase How Much are They Charging for Store Area.
• Changes in Ad Placement Physical and Web
Collection of ALL cellular/Bluetooth beacons.
• Cellular ESN emid Bluetooth beacons
• What is its purpose what is it abused for
• How to harden you communication best practices.
Collection of car sensors and WIFI Beacon 
data by billboards.
• Smart Billboard.
• How are they tracking
• Passive ?
• In the U.S. the Tread Act mandated that every car built after 2007 
must have a tire pressure monitoring system built-in
• (TPMSS) use unencrypted RF
• 314 mhz Unique ID (Every 60 seconds) 19MPH+
Data collected by applications/ Social media. 
• Social media explained 
• Social advertising 
• Data collection
• Abuse in past.
• B) How does it come back to you. 
• Reversing the randomness
Operating systems collecting information now 
to?
• Back in the good old days. XP
• 1984 ? Windows 10 info collection
• Miss information 
• P2p updates
• Data collection 
• Why are these changes happeneing
II. Explanation of Attacks
• Blocking Billboard Spying.
• Explain the main attack surface of the passive monitoring systems.
• How To Stop Brick and Mortor Spying
• How to Stop Web & OS Spying. 
1. Methods to Stop Billboard Spying.
• Smart Billboard Capture Vehicle sensor Information.
• Capture sensor information. Based on make and model they can 
expect age, Race, Sex, Income range 
• Passive ? And Opt in Applications (BT and WiFi)
• ROLLING TPMSS 10 Codes for around 17 Dollars.
• SHHHHH mode for your sensors.
• Can Add 3-4 Sets of tires to car also. NO NEED FOR DEALER
• Installing (GHD) Ground Hogs Day 315/433 System on Billboard 3400 
Sensors
So What Collected Data Allowed Them To 
Profile Me Online?
• What categories do they track, Technical level, Age, Sex, Orientation, 
Religion, Purchase history, Food Preferences, Hobbies, Employment, 
Political Views ETC How it is compiled
• How do they use it 
• Who is of interest.
• How do government portals work how is it shared 
• How is data held against people
• When this information is requested by law enforcement or an 
advertisement agency what is delivered how is it used
• Portals for Law Enforcement/Web Interfaces and Analytics. 
UI/UX overview of program Pick what they 
see as your age and areas of interest.
• Injecting false data
• Profile changing 
• Limiting accurate data
• Type FIST program (Never type directly into anything)
• Anti-Type Fist Engine Outputs key strokes at 28-GWPM
• Keystroke Injection From a VM (Emulate Simulate Mouse/KB)
• Browser Bot. 
• Not Detected By Search Provider/Web Browser Program 
don’t they have methods of tracking this type of 
activity how to evade tracking flagged or being 
flagged as a bot.
• I am not a robot. (not completely a robot)
• Evading SE protections
• Make it rain 
• Make it snow
• B : The joys of getting advertisements watching first hand your 
misinformation working.
• How the research progressed from accurate ads to almost random
• Pin and prodding search engines.
• Mapping out collection structure
• Feeding of data input output. 
Could this be used as a malware payload ? Make 
your Neighbor Look Like a terrorist or a Justin 
Bieber fan. (FRAME-WARE)
• How could some one load malware
• How could malware frame some one 
• How could it damage some ones life
• Even Worse Like NickleBack Facebook!!!
• Used it to Seed VM for Malware Testing.
Operating systems spy systems why you can’t turn 
them off – Can’t beat them miss inform them.

• How much can you mod OS before Microsoft blocks you
• Is the making me less secure 
• 2) Collection levels/ By IP address by system browser details system login.

• Details they track 
• Screen size, browser information
• Type fisting

macro Based Injection.
• Ghoest Writer./ Injection bot for the os
• How does it interact with other programs
• What are the limits ?
• Can windows stop this ?
• Ease of use.
What is your phone telling stores? a look at 
“NARC” Program for telling what your phone is 
giving off?
• Blocking output of your phone 
• Spoofing 
• Non root
• Generating Fake SMS/Email Messages Every Morning 
for Apps That Read the EULA 50/day rule
• Nice for Defcon/Blackhat Airplane Mode/Defcon Mode
How to inject 100s of fake Wifi BSSID/SSID
• (Hardware) Look at in-store tracking software/Heat mapping user 
collected data
• Device building
• How it works 
• how it effects handsets
• Collection of Beacons
Look at instore tracking how they heat map
• Look at instore tracking how they heat map
• Heatmap VS People counting
Injecting Bluetooth beacons/ Vehicle sensor 
information/ Cellular ID information/ Bluetooth 
coupon Injection exploitation/ Look at strange 
responses of customer tracking systems
• Over device reactions 
• Search Engine Profile Software
• Brick and Mortar Attack Tool.
III. Review of Devices used in Demo
How much does it throw off store data?
• The CV program dropped over 90% of customers entering
• Numbers Useless after 2HR
IV. Conclusions Demo
• A. Demonstration of Hardware Beacons laying waste to a SDR waterfall.
• B. Demonstration of “Profile This” software Obfuscating user profile from 
32 year old hacker to 12 year old girl who likes horses. 
• C. Conclusion of Demonstrations.
• D. Open to questions
• Demonstrate Type Fisting Hypervisor
• I am not a Robot
• Profile Injection
