Sorry if this is a duplicate. I searched and searched and I didn't find
something quite the same, but it _is_ similar and probably related to #14255
and a few other tickets all reporting broken events (all the tickets I found
are different classes of events, none specific to key events) since OOPIF.
I'm also not certain if this is intended behavior with OOPIF.
  * Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version`: `v3.0.2`
  * Operating System (Platform and Version):
    $ uname -a
    Linux lyra 4.18.10-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Sep 26 09:48:22 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  * Output of `node_modules/.bin/electron --version` on last known working Electron version (if applicable): `v3.0.0-beta.5`
**Expected Behavior**  
`keydown` `keypress`, etc events are emitted when a webview is focused.
**Actual behavior**  
No such events are emitted.
**To Reproduce**  
Please see https://github.com/cprussin/electron-webview-key-event-bug,
specifically the commit cprussin/electron-webview-key-event-bug@`1cec1ec`.
Clone the repo and run the typical setup commands:
    $ git clone https://github.com/cprussin/electron-webview-key-event-bug.git
    $ cd electron-webview-key-event-bug
    $ yarn
    $ npx electron .
Note that when you press any keys, you get an alert indicating what key you
pressed. Then, focus the webview and note that no longer do the alerts show.
Note that there's a key down listener attached to both the webview itself, and
the document element of the frame.
**Additional Information**
Everything inside the webview still works properly--e.g., if I add listeners
to the document element in a preload script, they are fired properly.
**EDIT** : I did further testing, and I've noticed that the `before-input-
event` event on the `webContents` instance for the window containing the
webview is also not fired. Not that this is particularly unexpected, just
figured it might be interesting or helpful.
**EDIT 2** : after more testing, this appears to work up to `3.0.0-beta.5`, as
with the related bug I linked (#14255) I've updated the header to this ticket
accordingly.
