User: The problem is like this:


the python on the server is version 2.4.3 (somewhat obsolete),
numpy is version 1.2.1 (obsolete) and
matplotlib is version 0.99.1.1
(devastating obsolete + lacks pyplot for some unknown reason).

I cannot use shell/bash on server. How can I renew the numpy and matplotlib to current versions? E.g., can I upload some folders of my python install to certain server locations and they will magically work? Or something different? 
Thank you for your attention.
P.S. I can manipulate python path on server during script execution.
Assistant: This sounds hacky and quite possibly evil, but if you don't have shell access but do have Python access, I suppose you could write a Python script that writes the library files to the proper location.
You can determine the location by examining the __file__ value in each module.  If this is a file system location the Python process has permissions write to (possibly the site package directory) it could be done.  If this is under a location you can't write to, then no. Be careful, this is quite hacky.
