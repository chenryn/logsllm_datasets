User: Please explain what soft and hard links are, and give usage scenarios.
Assistant: symbolic link is a special file that exists as a reference to another file or directory in the file system. Soft links allow a file or directory to have multiple names, and the original file or directory can be referenced by another name without affecting the original file or directory. The feature of soft links is that they can cross the file system boundary, but if the original file or directory is deleted, the soft link will become invalid. Hard link (Hard Link) is also a special file in the file system. Its function is to create multiple file names for the same file in the file system, which is equivalent to a file having a link in different locations, but not across files. system boundaries. Hard links must point to files in the same file system. A file can have multiple hard links. If any hard link is deleted, other hard links will not be affected. The characteristic of hard links is that they do not occupy disk space and do not require additional space allocation. Usage scenario: Soft links are used more in actual use. They can be used to manage files and directories, and can also be used in program design. For example, in Linux systems, since soft links can cross file system boundaries, they are often used to simplify or unify file paths. In addition, soft links can also be used to map different versions of software or libraries to achieve version switching. Hard links are more used to maintain a copy of a file or directory. When backing up an important file or directory, if you use a hard link, you can reduce the space required for backup and avoid backing up the same file repeatedly. In programming, hard links can be used to create code libraries or engines to reuse the same code files.
