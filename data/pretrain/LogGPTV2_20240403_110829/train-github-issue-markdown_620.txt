[X] feature request
This is a feature I am proposing for a future Angular.
**Current behavior**
Both FormGroup and FormControl provide `.valueChanges`, and observable stream
of changes to the control or group of controls' value. This is very helpful,
but it seems to omit the first value (before the first "change") for no
particularly good reason other than consistency with the name.
This is easily worked around by with something like this:
    const x$ = this.aControl.valueChanges.startWith(this.aControl.value);
... which is effective, but verbose and repetitive.
**Expected behavior**
Programmatically, very often when handling a control or group as an observable
stream, one wants access to the entire stream from the beginning.
Therefore, I request that `.valueChanges` be supplemented with `.values`,
which would be an Observable that emits both the initial value and changes.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
A search of Github yields numerous cases in published Angular code where
something similar to the above pattern appears.

All of these, as well as similar code behind countless corporate firewalls,
could be tightened up by this API improvement.
