The node module `util` uses `Object.create` in the `inherit`-function. But in
IE8 and lower `Object.create` is not defined. Thus `util` requires a shim to
work properly in these browsers.
Not all JavaScript 1.8.5 features available in `Object.create` can be emulated
but for the purpose of `inherit` I think this one provided by the MDN will do
it.
