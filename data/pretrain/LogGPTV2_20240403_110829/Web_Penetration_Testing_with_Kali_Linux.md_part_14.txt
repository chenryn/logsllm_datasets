### Chapter 5: Attacking Authentication

#### Introduction
Assigning a public IP address to Kali Linux is generally considered a poor security practice, as it may require opening firewalls and expose the system to potential remote attacks.

#### Gruyere Example
1. **Logging In and Creating an Account:**
   - Upon logging into Gruyere, create a username by clicking on the "Sign up" button located in the upper-right corner of the screen.
   - For this exercise, we created two separate accounts. Let's log in with the first account, which we named "TheDude."

2. **Creating a Snippet:**
   - Navigate to the snippet section and create a new snippet.
   - Enter a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) script. For example:
     ```javascript
     <script>document.write("XSS Attack")</script>
     ```
   - Note that although the text may wrap as you type, the command should be entered as a single line.

3. **Understanding XSS Vulnerabilities:**
   - Gruyere is intentionally designed with XSS vulnerabilities. In a real-world scenario, similar scripts can be used to test for XSS vulnerabilities in any field on a targeted website.
   - For instance, if Facebook had an XSS vulnerability in the middle name field, an attacker could exploit it by using the script as their middle name. However, this is a hypothetical example, as Facebook is not vulnerable to such attacks.

4. **Expanding Your Toolkit:**
   - Effective Penetration Testers use a combination of industry-standard tools like Kali Linux and custom scripts. We recommend researching and testing various XSS scripts against your Gruyere target to master the skill of building and executing custom script attacks.

#### Additional Tools in Kali Linux

- **urlsnarf:**
  - **Description:** Outputs all requested URLs sniffed from HTTP traffic in Common Log Format (CLF), suitable for offline post-processing with web log analysis tools.
  - **Usage:** Access urlsnarf via `Sniffing/Spoofing | Network Sniffers` and select `urlsnarf`. To use, type `urlsnarf â€“i <interface>` in the terminal, where `<interface>` is the network interface you want to monitor.

- **acccheck:**
  - **Description:** A password dictionary attack tool targeting Windows authentication using the SMB protocol. It is a wrapper script around `smbclient`.

- **hexinject:**
  - **Description:** A versatile packet injector and sniffer providing a command-line framework for raw network access. It can inject anything into the network and calculate checksums and packet size fields of TCP/IP protocols.

- **Patator:**
  - **Description:** A multi-purpose brute force utility with a modular design, capable of brute-forcing various protocols including FTP, SSH, Telnet, SMTP, HTTP/HTTPS, POP, IMAP, LDAP, SMB, MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL, DNS, SNMP, and password files.

- **DBPwAudit:**
  - **Description:** Performs online audits of password quality for several database engines. Additional database drivers can be added by copying new JDBC drivers to the JDBC directory.

#### Summary
Compromising authentication allows an attacker to pose as an authorized user, bypassing traditional security defenses. This chapter covered methods to attack and evaluate authentication processes, including session management, cookie handling, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The next chapter will focus on remote and web-based attacks on servers and clients.

### Chapter 6: Web Attacks

#### Introduction
This chapter focuses on Internet-based attacks and the tools available in Kali Linux to bypass standard security defenses. Security administrators are aware of the continuous threat from malicious parties, and common defenses include Firewalls, IPS/IDS, and host-based security products. However, modern threats can circumvent these defenses, making it essential to understand and utilize advanced penetration testing tools.

#### Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)
- **Description:** BeEF is a browser-based exploit package that "hooks" browsers to launch attacks. It bypasses network security appliances and host-based antivirus applications by exploiting vulnerabilities in common browsers.
- **Installation:**
  1. Open a terminal as root and run:
     ```bash
     apt-get update
     apt-get install beef-xss
     ```
  2. Start BeEF by navigating to `/usr/share/beef-xss` and typing `./beef`.
  3. Access the administration server at `http://<IP>:3000/ui/panel` with the default credentials `beef:beef`.

- **Usage:**
  - Victims can be tricked into accessing the hook URL, and once hooked, BeEF provides detailed information about the victim's system and allows the execution of various commands.

#### Defending Against Browser-Based Attacks
- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep all browser software updated with the latest versions and security patches.
  - Disable Flash and Java in the browser.
  - Use Next Generation Intrusion Prevention Systems (NGIPS) to detect and prevent application-based threats.

#### FoxyProxy - Firefox Plugin
- **Description:** FoxyProxy is a Firefox extension that simplifies managing proxy settings.
- **Installation:**
  1. Download and install FoxyProxy from the Firefox add-on library.
  2. Configure a new proxy by adding the IP or Host address and port number.

#### BURP Proxy
- **Description:** BURP Proxy intercepts and manipulates HTTP and HTTPS traffic, allowing Penetration Testers to examine and modify requests.
- **Usage:**
  1. Launch Burp Suite from `Kali | Sniffing/Spoofing | Web Sniffers`.
  2. Configure the proxy settings and set up the browser to use Burp Suite.
  3. Use the Intercept feature to examine and manipulate requests.
  4. Utilize the Spider feature to map web applications and discover new targets.

#### OWASP ZAP
- **Description:** ZAP is an integrated Penetration Testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Usage:**
  1. Access ZAP from `Sniffing/Spoofing | Web Sniffers` or by typing `zap` in the terminal.
  2. Use ZAP to scan and identify XSS vulnerabilities and other web application flaws.

By mastering these tools and techniques, Penetration Testers can effectively identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications and servers, enhancing their ability to conduct thorough and effective security assessments.
