Then, we checked for multi-construct outliers on the LevelUser
and found 3 participants with conspicuous Mahalanobis dis-
tances. We also found 6 outliers on the LevelRequest. Since
the removal of outliers did not change the model ﬁts, signiﬁ-
cance levels, and conclusions, we opted to keep them in the
analysis [57]. Additionally, we checked the ﬁnal models for
multicollinearity and found no such case (V IF < 2).
Effect of users’ individuality: The ﬁnal models were able
to explain 47.6%–76.5% of the total variance in the outcome
variables (Conditional R2), whereby it is worth to note that a
large proportion of this variance is explained by the indi-
vidual differences between users. For example, in the ﬁnal
Decision model, intraclass correlation for the LevelUser was
ICC = 0.490, which means that 49% of the empirical variance
of permission decisions can solely be explained by individual
differences between users. The same applies for the DES:
DesInform (ICCUser = 0.321), DesSatis (ICCUser = 0.432), and
DesControl (ICCUser = 0.625). In contrast, differences between
users in the ClarityPost model only explained 7.8% of the em-
pirical variance, which is due to the fact that we controlled
for ClarityPre in the same model.
6.3 Effect of Timing and Rationales
Permission Decision (Decision): Participants’ permission
decision was explained best (76.5% of the empirical variance)
by a model including the two main variables of interest but not
their interaction (Model Step 3, AIC = 1449.35, LogLik =
−713.68). We found that both timing and rationales had a
positive effect on grant rates. When permissions were re-
quested in context, grant rates increased by 48% (oddsratio =
1.48, standardized β = 0.39, p = 0.017). Additionally, it was
173% more likely that participants grant permissions when ra-
tionales were provided compared to permission requests with-
out rationales (odds ratio = 2.73, std. β = 1.00, p < 0.001).
Overall, if permissions were requested upfront and without
rationales, they were granted in only 74% of the cases, while
they were granted in 92% of the cases if they were requested
in context and with rationales (see Figure 7a for an overview
of the predicted probabilities of granting permissions).
Informed Decision (DesInform): Participants’ perception of
having made an informed decision was explained best (47.6%
of the empirical variance) by a model including the vari-
ables of interest and their interaction (Model Step 4, AIC =
5633.44, LogLik = −2802.72). The model shows a signiﬁ-
cant interaction of timing and rationales (β = −0.37, std.β =
−0.27, p < 0.001). Overall, rationales had a positive effect
on whether participants’ decision was informed, however,
this effect was stronger when rationales were shown up-
front instead of in context. Furthermore, timing was only
signiﬁcant when no rationales were present. This means that
without rationales, requesting permissions in context in-
creases informed decision, as is depicted in Figure 7b.
Decision Satisfaction (DesSatis): Participants’ satisfaction
with their decision was explained best (54.9% of the empir-
ical variance) by a model including the two main variables
of interest as well as their interaction (Model Step 4, AIC =
4695.43, LogLik = −2333.72). The results show a signiﬁcant
interaction of timing and rationales (β = −0.20, std. β =
−0.19, p = 0.003). On one hand, when permissions were

requested upfront, rationales had a positive effect on de-
cision satisfaction, but when requested in context, ratio-
nales had no signiﬁcant effect. On the other hand, timing
had no effect on satisfaction (see Figure 7c).
Decision Control (DesControl): Participants’ perceived con-
trol over their permission decision was explained best
(67.9% of the empirical variance) by a model that included
the two variables of interest but without their interaction
(Model Step 3, AIC = 5243.57, LogLik = −2608.78). The
results show no signiﬁcant effect of timing and rationales
on decision control, as shown in Figure 7d.
Permission Clarity (ClarityPost): Participants’ perceived
clarity of the permission purpose was explained best (56.2%
of the empirical variance) by a model including the two
main variables of interest as well as their interaction
(Model Step 4, AIC = 6418.44, LogLik = −3196.22). Af-
ter controlling for the initial clarity of permission requests,
we found a signiﬁcant interaction of timing and rationales
(β = −0.37, std. β = −0.18, p = 0.003). On one hand, the
effect of timing was only signiﬁcant without rationales, mean-
ing that post clarity increased when permissions were re-
quested in context without rationales. On the other hand,
rationales signiﬁcantly increased permission clarity for
both upfront and in-context permission requests, however, this
effect is stronger for upfront requests, as shown in Figure 7e.
6.4 Effect of Other Variables
Privacy Concerns (PrivConc): Participants’ privacy concerns
had a negative effect on the likelihood to grant permissions
(odds ratio = 0.64, std. β = −0.57, p < 0.001), but not on
the other outcome variables. In other words, participants with
higher privacy concerns are less likely to grant permissions
than those with lower concerns.
Prior Privacy Experience (PriorExp): The data revealed
that the more participants dealt with privacy related expe-
riences in the past, the more likely they were to grant permis-
sions (oddsratio = 1.91, std.β = 1.00, p < 0.001). Whereas
for decision satisfaction, decision control, and clarity of the
requested permission more privacy related experiences de-
creased the score of these scales. Only for informed decision,
we could not ﬁnd an effect of prior privacy experience.
Permission Clarity (ClarityPre): Participants’ initial clar-
ity of the permission purpose had a signiﬁcant effect on
all outcome variables. Having an initial understanding of
the permission purpose increased the odds to grant permis-
sions by 106% (oddsratio = 2.06, std.β = 1.53, p < 0.001).
Also, for all three DES, a positive effect of initial clarity was
found. Furthermore, the clearer the permission request was
before interacting with the app, the clearer it was afterwards
(β = 0.59, std. β = 0.61, p < 0.001).
Permission Sensitivity (PermSens): There was a negative
effect of permission sensitivity on decision (odds ratio =
0.53, std. β = −0.99, p < 0.001). Meaning, that permissions
perceived as sensitive are less likely to be granted.
Permission Decision as a Control Variable (Decision): As
for the effect of permission decision, we found that granting
a permission increased the perception that the decision was
informed, while it decreased decision satisfaction and the per-
ception of being in control.
Effect of other control variables: To rule out potential alter-
native explanations for our results, we built additional models
to examine whether there were any changes in the outcomes
due to the ordering of permission requests, having interacted
with the app before, and the predictability of permissions.
None of these control variables signiﬁcantly changed the ef-
fect of timing and rationales on the outcome variables. Also,
we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of gender or age. Neither
did participants’ education, having a computer science back-
ground, or participants’ mobile OS explain any additional

signiﬁcant difference in the effect of timing and rationales.
6.5 Rationale Recall (RationaleRecall)
To further rule out potential alternative explanations for our
results, we built the models again for attentive participants
only. For that, two researchers analyzed and independently
coded the free text answers of participants’ ability to recall
the content of the rationale messages. The analysis showed
almost perfect inter-rater agreement between the two coders
(Cohen(cid:48)sκ = 0.87) and all differences were resolved in agree-
ment. Four themes emerged in the coding process: (1) Partici-
pants correctly recalled all or parts of the rationale message
(correct), (2) they did not recall the content of the rationale
and provided unrelated responses (unrelated), (3) they admit
to have forgotten the content of the rationale (forgotten), or
(4) they claim to have not seen the rationale dialog (unseen).
From all rationale recall answers (N = 899), 49% were coded
as correct, 45% as unrelated, 5% as forgotten, and 1% as un-
seen. These percentages reﬂect the user’s general inattention
to security and privacy related information [59–61] that would
have also occurred if participants interacted with the apps on
their real phones. Each model was built again for attentive
participants who recalled the content of at least one of the
rationales. We found that the effect on timing and rationales
was consistent and did not change. The only difference was
that rationales had a signiﬁcant effect on DesControl. In order
to stay on the conservative side, we only considered the results
of the main analysis.
6.6 Rationale Origin (RationaleOrigin)
Participants were asked once about the rationale origin for
each app that displayed a rationale. However, since each par-
ticipant interacted with two apps with rationales, we only
considered the last response given. We found that 57% (270)
of the participants correctly identiﬁed the app developer as
the provider of the rationale, while 37% (175) thought that
it came from the operating system. We checked whether the
operating system of the participant’s mobile phone was one of
the reasons for this misunderstanding, which was not the case.
The remaining 26 participants said that they do not know who
provided rationales and 2 gave unrelated answers.
6.7 Permission Purpose (PermPurp)
We found that asking participants about the purpose of permis-
sions did not yield useful insights, as the responses reﬂected
participants’ subjective perception of permission purposes.
Therefore, we do not report on the results.
7 Discussion
Our study is the ﬁrst to explore the effect of timing and ra-
tionales and their interplay on users’ runtime permission de-
cisions and the evaluation of their decisions. We found that
timing and rationales matter even after accounting for user
and app-level differences identiﬁed in previous work. In ad-
dition, we showed that timing and rationales should not be
evaluated in isolation because both might inﬂuence one an-
other. We also found that a large proportion of the variance
in the outcome variables can be explained by the individual
differences between users.
Effect of timing. Requesting permissions in context pri-
marily beneﬁts developers, as such an approach increases
grant rates. Whereas requesting permissions in-context only
has a positive effect on users’ perception of their decisions
without rationales.
Effect of rationales. Requesting permissions with ratio-
nales beneﬁts both developers and users, as such an approach
increases grant rates, helps users in making informed deci-
sions by increasing their understanding of the permission
purpose, and positively affects decision satisfaction. Whereby,
the beneﬁts of rationales are greatest for upfront requests,
when users may lack contextual data for decision making.
Alternative to Google’s guidelines. Google’s guidelines
recommend to use four strategies to help developers keep deny
rates to a minimum [2]. The guidelines suggest requesting
app-critical permissions upfront and function-speciﬁc per-
missions in context, in addition to providing rationales for
unclear permissions. While these suggestions seem straight-
forward, we found while designing our study and also in pre-
vious work [8], that permission clarity is a subjective measure.
Thus, it is unreasonable to require developers to accurately
evaluate which permission requests might not be clear to their
end users (and therefore require a rationale). In addition, our
results show that some permission request strategies are, on
average, less effective than others. For example, when asked
for permission upfront without rationale, users are least likely
to grant permissions and positively perceive their permission
decisions. Therefore, it is less effective than the other three
strategies. We also found that adding rationales (upfront as
well as in-context) beneﬁts both developers and end users.
Developers primarily proﬁt from increased grant rates, while
users are able to make informed decisions that they better
understand and are more satisﬁed with.
Based on these ﬁndings, we propose to adjust Google’s
guidelines as follows. Instead of four permission request
strategies, we limit developers’ choices to two strategies only.
Permissions should be either requested upfront with rationale
or in context with rationale. Therefore, unlike Google’s guide-
lines, we recommend that rationales should always be present,
while preserving their suggestion to request app-critical per-
missions upfront and function-speciﬁc permissions in context.

With this simpliﬁcation, we expect to keep grant rates at a
high level and at the same time make users feel comfortable
with their runtime permission decisions.
Individually tailored system support. Google’s guide-
lines put the burden on developers to decide when to request
permissions (timing) and whether to provide further explana-
tions (rationales). Even with our improvements, developers’
still have to time permission requests for all users. Addition-
ally, our results showed that users differ in their decisions and
the way they make those decisions, led by their own values
and preferences. So, instead of a strategy that attempts to ﬁt all
users with the burden on developers, our intuitive deduction
is to provide a solution to support users’ individuality.
One concrete suggestion is the customization of permis-
sion requests on a per-user basis, realized by the operating
system. Users could use system settings to determine when
they want to be asked for permissions and whether they prefer
to see rationales. While developers only have to follow a sim-
ple pattern to label the in-context positions for permissions
and provide a list of rationales (similar to iOS [62]). One
