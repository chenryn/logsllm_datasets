A Attribute Correlation in Datasets
This section provides information on correlation cases
for the datasets and attributes in Table 3.
Health Dataset. We measure the correlations between
Gender or ClaimsTruncated and the 133 categorical
attributes and 6 numerical attributes by Cramer’s V
scores and point biserial correlation coefﬁcients, respec-
tively. With Gender as the sensitive attribute, we identify
22 categorical attributes that have Cramer’s V scores
greater than 0.15 and 2 numerical attributes that have
point biserial correlation (absolute value) greater than
0.1. The attributes that have the highest Cramer’s V are
sp10 (0.218), noSpecialities (0.212), noProviders
(0.208), noVendors (0.201). To give a overview of corre-
lations including weak correlation with other attributes,
we identify 17 attributes that have Cramer’s V scores
within the range [0.1,0.15] and 37 attributes Cramer’s V
scores within the range [0.5,0.1]. The Cramer’s V score
between DaysInHospital and Gender is 0.09, and thus,
we deem them as uncorrelated. With ClaimsTruncated
as the sensitive attribute, we identify 50 categorical at-
tributes (e.g., sp1 (0.42), sp2 (0.51), pcg1 (0.41), etc.)

that have Cramer’s V scores greater than 0.15, and 4
numerical attributes that have point biserial correlation
(absolute value) greater than 0.1. The score between
DaysInHospital and ClaimsTruncated is 0.13, and
we set them uncorrelated.
Adult Dataset. We measure the correlations between
Gender or Income and the 7 categorical attributes and 4
numerical attributes by Cramer’s V scores and point bis-
erial correlation coefﬁcients, respectively. We list all the
correlation factors in Table 9, as X only has 11 attributes.
For Gender, we identify 4 categorical attributes that have
Cramer’s V scores above 0.15 and 1 numerical attribute
that has point biserial correlation coefﬁcients above 0.1.
The sensitive attribute Income has a high Cramer’s V
score with 5 categorical attributes and the target variable
EducationLevel, as well as high point biserial correla-
tion coefﬁcients with 4 numerical attributes.
Crime Dataset. Since all features are numerical, we
measure the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients. Table 10
shows the number of attributes that have the coefﬁcients
within a certain range. We use 0.4 as the threshold to
determine X(cid:48). The target variable CrimesPerPop is cor-
related with both TotalPctDivorce and Income, with
correlation coefﬁcients 0.553 and −0.424, respectively.

sensitive attribute ProductType used during training.
Yelp-Health and Amazon Datasets. For Yelp-Health
dataset, the point biserial correlation coefﬁcients between
Specialty and ReviewRating is 0.009, hence, the sce-
nario corresponds X ∼ A,Y⊥A. The review text is clearly
correlated with the doctor specialty as in Table 4 in [39].
For the Amazon dataset, since the ProductType has 4
levels, we use the ANOVA to test whether the differences
between the means of ReviewScore across different
product types are statistically signiﬁcant. The ANOVA p-
value is 7.6e− 83. We conjecture that the co-purchasing
graph X is also correlated with the ProductType. and
hence X ∼ A,Y ∼ A.
B Additional Results
We present attack results for Health, Adult and Crime
dataset with smaller size of Daux from Table 2. We show
accuracies for both pooled model and the honest party’s
local model and the utility increase in Table 11. Figure 5
complements results in Section 6.4 on Amazon dataset
trained with the sensitive attribute A.

Table 12: Multi-Party Setting: Black-box attack accuracy
for predicting the value of the distribution of sensitive
variable A in the dataset of Phonest. We use smaller size
of Daux listed in Table 2, while all other settings are the
same as in Table 4.
White-box Attack Results Additionally, we per-
formed experiments where the attacker has access to the
model parameters, i.e., the white box setting. As for the
meta-classiﬁer model, we use a two-layer network with
200 and 50 hidden units and learning rate 0.001. Each
meta-classiﬁer is trained based on 100 shadow models
using Adam optimizer. Here, the meta-classiﬁer takes as
input model parameters as opposed to model inferences.
Table 13 shows the results. For logistic regression, the
results are similar to those in Table 5 for the black-box

Table 13: White-box attack accuracy for predicting
whether the values of sensitive variable A in Dhonest, the
data of the honest party, are predominantly  5.
The attack accuracy is evaluated on 100 Dhonest datasets:
half with 33:67 and half with 67:33 split and Dadv has
33:67 split. A synthetic correlation with A is added to the
variables X and Y depending on the speciﬁc case. R cor-

setting. However, the attack accuracy for neural networks
(MLP) reduces signiﬁcantly. This was noted in the work
by [18]. One reason is that it is hard for a naive meta-
classiﬁer to learn the structure of equivalent symmetrical
weights of neural networks. Indeed, one of their contri-
butions is a technique for identifying this symmetry.
