### Consolidated EPC Architecture and Fault Tolerance

A consolidated EPC (Evolved Packet Core) architecture is proposed, but it lacks fault tolerance. In contrast, Neutrino aims to design a faster and more consistent cellular control plane. Neutrino can be integrated into consolidated EPC architectures like PEPC. Skycore [40] consolidates RAN (Radio Access Network) and EPC, specifically designed for deployment scenarios where base stations are mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Skycore broadcasts user state updates to neighboring nodes, which, as our evaluation (§6) shows, does not scale well.

### Network Function Failure Recovery

There are existing proposals for middlebox failure recovery, such as [51, 54]. Neutrino's failure recovery mechanism is partially inspired by these prior works in the general middlebox context. However, Neutrino's specific failure recovery scheme, which includes per-procedure checkpointing and message logging, is tailored to meet the consistency and latency requirements of cellular networks.

### Conclusion

Next-generation cellular networks aim to support new and emerging applications with ultra-low latency and high reliability. In this work, we identify key issues in meeting these requirements in existing cellular control planes. We design Neutrino, a new edge-based cellular control plane that provides users with reliable access to cellular services while ensuring lower latency. Our results show that Neutrino can significantly improve the performance of latency-sensitive applications while tolerating control plane failures. With discussions about 5G core architectures actively underway, we hope this paper will contribute to the discourse on control plane designs.

### Discussion

#### Deployability

Neutrino is designed for next-generation cellular networks like 5G and 6G. It requires only minimal changes to base stations (BS), replacing ASN.1 with Neutrino’s FBs-based serialization engine. As cellular providers upgrade BS for 5G deployments, upgrading the serialization engine should not be a significant barrier to adopting Neutrino. However, Neutrino’s serialization engine is not compatible with previous generations of cellular networks (4G/LTE and earlier). Nevertheless, Neutrino’s consistency protocol (§4.2) and proactive state replication scheme (§4.3) can seamlessly work with 4G/LTE.

#### Serialization Tradeoff

Neutrino’s serialization scheme reduces encoding/decoding time by up to 19.2× at the cost of increased message size. Given the increasing bandwidth in cellular networks, we believe this tradeoff is acceptable for cellular providers. We are currently investigating further optimizations in Neutrino’s FB-based compiler to reduce overhead in message sizes while retaining its latency benefits.

#### Scaling Distributed MMEs

Recent proposals for scaling MMEs include [12, 14, 31, 43]. SCALE [14] proposes mechanisms for scaling a software 4G/LTE MME to handle increasing signaling load, using state replication and consistent-hashing-based load balancing. MMLite [43] proposes a load balancing solution for MMEs, leveraging skewed consistent hashing to distribute incoming connections more efficiently. However, both SCALE and MMLite do not provide consistency guarantees. MobileStream [31] proposes a programmable mobile core control platform that decomposes the control plane into multiple stateless and one stateful node, externalizing user state. While MobileStream offers better programmability, it can introduce latency in edge-deployment scenarios due to lookups on a remote state store. In comparison, Neutrino provides (i) consistency guarantees, (ii) faster serialization, and (iii) faster failure recovery. Other general proposals for externalizing NFs also exist, but they do not address the specific needs of cellular networks.
