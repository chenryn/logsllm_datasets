The only thing std::time contains is `Duration`, which isn't too useful on its
own. The real meat of it is in `::time`.
Perhaps one should be moved into the other?
Alternatively, we can add some docs to `Duration` that explain how to work
with it. One common way of getting a `Duration` is to subtract two instances
of `time::now().to_timespec()`s, however this is completely not obvious on
`std::time`. I don't mind adding these docs.
