when using typescript, `expect` assertions are not typechecked. since
playwright supports typescript, i would expect the assertions to be
typechecked, otherwise the typescript support is completely pointless
### System info
  * Playwright Version: 1.30.0
  * Operating System: windows 10
  * Browser: all
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Test file (self-contained)**
    // tests/test.ts
    test('asdf', async ({ page }) => {
      // this is wrong:
      expect(page.locator('li').count()).toBe(2)
      // the argument to expect needs to be awaited, like so:
      // expect(await page.locator('li').count()).toBe(2)
    });
**Steps**
  1. run `tsc` on the test file
  2. run the test
**Expected**
compile error because it's comparing a `Promise` to a `number`
**Actual**
no compile error, fails at runtime with a misleading error message:
      1) tests\test.ts:8:1 â€º asdf ====================================================
        Error: expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality
        Expected: 1
        Received: {}
as well as an even more misleading error (#17869 (comment)):
    Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded while tearing down "context".
