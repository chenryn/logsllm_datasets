User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Strange requests to web server I have a Linode VPS running Nginx, which currently serves only static content.

Once I was looking at the log and noticed some strange requests:

Should I worry about somebody trying to hack my server in this case?

Assistant: It appears that your server is the target of an automated attack involving the ZmEu scanner.

That first request appears to be from another automated attack involving the Morfeus Scanner.

That last request appears to be an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the Home Network Administration Protocol (HNAP) implementations of D-Link routers. More information about the attack can be found here.

From a cusory glance at the request it's making, I'd say you have nothing to worry about if you aren't running phpmyadmin on your systems. Such attacks are commonplace for servers connected to the internet and the scans are getting 404's indicating that your server does not have what they are looking for.
