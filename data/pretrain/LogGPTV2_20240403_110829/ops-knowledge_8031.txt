User: So I am an inexperienced Python coder, with what I have gathered might be a rather complicated need. I am a cognitive scientist and I need precise stimulus display and button press detection. I have been told that the best way to do this is by using real-time operating, but have no idea how to go about this. Ideally, with each trial, the program would operate in real-time, and then once the trial is over, the OS can go back to not being as meticulous. There would be around 56 trials. Might there be a way to code this from my python script?
(Then again, all I need to know is when a stimulus is actually displayed. The real-time method would assure me that the stimulus is displayed when I want it to be, a top-down approach. On the other hand, I could take a more bottom-up approach if it is easier to just know to record when the computer actually got a chance to display it.)
Assistant: If you are running the Python code on Linux machine, make the kernel low latency (preemptive).
There is a flag for it when you compile the kernel.
Make sure that other processes running on the machine are minimum so they do not interrupt the kernel.
Assign higher task priority to your Python script.
