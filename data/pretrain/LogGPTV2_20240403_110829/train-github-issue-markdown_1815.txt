  * Electron version: 1.6.8 or 1.7.1
  * Operating system: Windows
### Expected behavior
In windows multiple monitor setup with different DPIs, electron app starts out
of bounds
### Actual behavior
Should start at the same place where app was last opened
### How to reproduce
  1. Have two monitors with 200% and 100% DPI
  2. Start electron app and move the app to monitor with 100% DPI (non maximized)
  3. Quit and Restart the app
App starts out of the bounds in the 100% DPI monitor.
This is a regression after #8786 . I reverted this change and this issue no
longer repros.
