I am building my backend server based on the `next.js/custome-express
example`, however, when I load a page I always get this error:
    Refused to execute script from 'https://localhost:8081/_next/1511072683838/manifest.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
I noticed in `dev` the `1511072683838` is like a random number, however, in
the `production` environment, it is an `uuid`. I am curious how can I use this
number in my `express` server route, and is it safe to discard the number?
e.g, having a route like:
    app.use('/_next/:id/', constants.corsOptions, express.static(path.join(root, 'server', 'src', 'next', '.next')));
If I use this method and throw the `:id` parameter away will there be any
issue (e.g security)? Or should I use this number as `nonce` in my `pages`, if
that's the case how can I set the `nonce`.
Thanks!
