In 1.0.0-beta.20 If I set autoHideDuration={null}, onRequestClose() is
triggered immediately as if the value is 0
  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The docs say autoHideDuration will be disabled if set to null
## Current Behavior
Currently null is treated like 0, however I can set it to undefined and it
works like it used to.
I want to keep the snackbar visible indefinitely only if there are more
details (accessed through a link in the snnackbar), so code looks something
like this:
        ]}
    />
The workaround is fine
` autoHideDuration={hasMoreDetails ? undefined : 4000}`
.. but then the docs need updating
