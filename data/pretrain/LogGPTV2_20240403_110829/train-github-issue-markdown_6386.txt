As you can see in the image bellow, If we go on with the example of the
Hoizontal Form and don't have the checkbox, then the button will render
without margins and ugly.

But if we have the checkbox, it will render good.
Why don't have something like button class for divs? (Same as what we have in
the example for checkbox):
