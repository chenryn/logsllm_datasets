User: Please analyze Git's branch model, including master branch, development branch, release branch, etc., and give a usage scenario.
Assistant: Git's branch model includes master branch (master), development branch (develop), feature branch (feature), release branch (release), patch branch (hotfix), etc. The following are the uses and scenarios of each branch: 1. Main branch ( master): The master branch is the "golden branch" in the repository and is usually used to store stable, releasable code versions. The code merged from the main branch should be fully tested and reviewed to ensure its quality. Scenario: The master branch is used to store stable official versions, and is generally only updated when a new version is released. It is currently the most mature, stable, and reliable version. 2. Development branch (develop): The development branch is the "green branch" in the repository, which is usually used to store the submitted code of developers. The development branch contains features and improvements planned for the next release. A lot of experimentation and trial and error can be done in the development branch. Scenario: The development branch is used for daily development work and allows developers to submit code freely. It is the branch with the most frequent code changes and the largest amount of changes. 3. Feature branch (feature): The feature branch is branched from the development branch and is usually used to implement specific functions. Once the code of the feature branch is considered complete and stable by the developers, it can be merged into the development branch. The naming of feature branches can be defined in the format of "feature/function name". Scenario: Feature branches are used when developing new functionality or features, independently of other work, and can be worked on in free time. 4. Release branch (release): The release branch is a temporary branch used to prepare for the release of a new version. The release branch does not allow new features to be added, except to fix some minor bugs or update some documentation and version numbers on the release branch. Release branches are considered relatively stable and can be finalized and reviewed by testers. After the Bug is fixed on the release branch, it can be merged into the master and develop branches. The naming of the release branch can be defined according to the "release/version number" format. Scenario: The release branch is used to prepare for the release of a new version, including packaging, testing, and release version numbers. 5. Hotfix branch (hotfix): The hotfix branch is a temporary branch used to correct urgent bugs or security holes in the existing release version. The hotfix branch is established based on the master branch. Once the patch branch is ready, it must be merged into the master branch and the develop branch to ensure that the next version also includes this fix to the existing version. The name of the hotfix branch can be defined in the form of "hotfix/patched version number". Scenario: The patch branch is used to fix important and urgent bugs or security vulnerabilities, and is generally created based on the release branch or the main branch.
