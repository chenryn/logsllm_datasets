### Title: BlackHat EU-18: Thermanator and the Thermal Residue Attack

As warm-blooded mammals, humans leave thermal residue on various objects they touch, including common input devices such as keyboards. These devices are often used to enter sensitive information, such as passwords and PINs. While thermal residue dissipates over time, there is a window of opportunity during which thermal energy readings can be harvested from input devices to recover recently entered, potentially sensitive information.

To date, there has been no systematic investigation into the thermal profiles of keyboards, and consequently, no efforts have been made to secure them. This gap in security motivated the development of Thermanator, a framework designed for password harvesting from keyboard thermal emanations.

In this presentation, we introduce Thermanator and demonstrate that several popular keyboards from different manufacturers are vulnerable to thermal side-channel attacks. Thermanator allows us to accurately determine entire passwords tens of seconds after they are entered, and it significantly reduces the search space for brute-force attacks. The latter remains effective even up to 60 seconds after password entry. Additionally, we show that these thermal side-channel attacks can be conducted from a distance of several feet.

Our findings are based on extensive experiments involving multiple subjects, using a variety of common keyboards and representative passwords. We use a thermal (FLIR) camera to demonstrate these thermal side-channel attacks. We also present a realistic "Coffee-Break Attack" scenario, where an adversary can surreptitiously capture a victim's password via the thermal side-channel in a typical multi-user office setting or public space.
