I have been using the `dnspython` module in Python. However, I am encountering an issue on a new Linux installation where the module is not being loaded. I have attempted to clean up and reinstall, but the installation does not seem to be working.

Here are the steps I have taken and the corresponding output:

```bash
$ python --version
Python 2.7.3

$ sudo pip install dnspython
Downloading/unpacking dnspython
  Downloading dnspython-1.11.1.zip (220Kb): 220Kb downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package dnspython

Installing collected packages: dnspython
  Running setup.py install for dnspython

Successfully installed dnspython
Cleaning up...

$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dns
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named dns
```

Additionally, here is the output for the Python and pip versions:

```bash
$ which python
/usr/bin/python

$ python --version
Python 2.7.3

$ pip --version
pip 1.0 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
```

I have a firewall installed on the new machine, and although I am unsure if it should affect the import, I have tried disabling it, but the issue persists.

Thank you very much for your help.

**Note:** I encountered a similar issue on my Mac with Python 3.7.3. The following steps resolved the problem for me:

```bash
pip3 uninstall dnspython
sudo -H pip3 install dnspython
```

After these steps, I was able to successfully import the `dns` module:

```python
import dns
import dns.resolver
```
