##### Description of the problem
Hi - I'm working in a react-three-fiber project but I can reproduce the issue
in threejs standalone.
Context: I have a scene with many objects loaded in via gltfLoader, some of
which are instanced and some of which aren't. A background environment model,
non-instanced, and lots of smaller objects instanced many times. It all works
fine until I try to add ambient occlusion. If I just have the background model
it works, and similarly if I only have instanced meshes and no background
model it also works. It's the combination of the two where it fails with:
    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'isInterleavedBufferAttribute' of undefined

I can reproduce the error (I took the dynamic instancedmesh example and added
two boxes and ambient occlusion) :

Some other info/observations:
  * Similar issue reported here (with NormalPass instead of SSAOPass) where @drcmda thinks the issue might be in the post-processing code:  
https://spectrum.chat/react-three-fiber/general/why-does-instancedmesh-not-
allow-to-have-other-meshes-in-canvas~6a231bd5-3437-405c-97ed-7260cfc17bd7
  * In the jsfiddle example I can fix the issue by creating my non-instanced meshes outside of the gltfLoader success callback. It's not immediately obvious to me how this helps me in my react-three-fiber project though so I've just listed it as an observation.
Appreciate any advice or nudges in the right direction
Thanks!
