they illustrate the substantial potential impacts of pollu-
tion attacks. Similarly, our speciﬁc pollution attacks are
fragile, as each service can take relatively simple steps to
defend againt them.
A possible defense against pollution attacks arises
from the fact
that cross-site request forgery can be
stopped if requests to a website must carry tokens issued
by the site. Enforcing this constraint, however, also pre-
vents information and behaviors at third-party sites from
being harvested for personalization and hampers the cur-
rent trend of increasing the scope of data collection by
websites for improved personalization. One short-term
effect from this study may be that (some) websites will
begin to consider the tradeoffs between the security and
beneﬁts of personalization.
YouTube in particular uses two separate HTTP re-
quests to track a YouTube’s user viewing activity that
are independent from the act of streaming of the video.
One straightforward defense against pollution attacks is
to monitor the time between the arrivals of the two HTTP
requests. If YouTube ﬁnds the interval is substantially
less than the length of the video, it could ignore the sig-
nal. An attacker can still always inject a short video or
control the timing of the HTTP requests in an effort to
bypass such a defense mechanism. We did notice that
an injected short video can be used to promote multi-
ple longer videos; for example, watching a single two-

mulative Success Rate for a given range of product rank-
ings is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of successfully
promoted products to the number of target products in
that range.
Figure 10 shows the cumulative promotion rate for dif-
ferent product rankings for the two different types of pol-
lution attacks. As the target product decreases in popu-
larity (i.e., has a higher ranking position within its cat-
egory) pollution attacks become less effective, but this
phenomenon reﬂects a limitation of Amazon recommen-
dation algorithms, not our attack. Products with low
rankings might not be purchased as often; as a result,
they may have few and weak co-visit and co-purchase re-
lationships with other products. Our preliminary inves-
tigation ﬁnds that products which rank 2,000 or higher
within their category have at least a 50% chance of be-
ing promoted by a visit-based pollution attack, and prod-
ucts with rankings 10,000 and higher have at least a 30%
chance to be promoted using search-based attacks.
6 Related Work
To the best of our knowledge, the line of work most
closely related to ours is black-hat search engine op-
timization (bSEO). Although sharing a common goal
as search history pollution—illicitly promoting website
rankings in search results—bSEO follows a completely
different approach, exploiting a search engine’s reliance
on crawled Web content. Blackhat SEO engineers the
content of and links to Web pages to obtain a favorable
ranking for search terms of interest [8]. Thus, techniques
that address bSEO are unlikely to be effective against
pollution attacks. On the other hand, because bSEO
targets the general indexing and ranking process inside
search engines, any successfully promoted website will
be visible to all search engine users, potentially signiﬁ-
cantly boosting the volume of incoming trafﬁc. Yet, ef-
fective bSEO campaigns typically involve support from

8 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a new attack on personalized
services that exploits the fact that personalized services
use a user’s past history to customize content that they
present to the user. Our attack pollutes a user’s history
by using cross-site request forgery to stealthily inject and
execute a set of targeted browsing activities in the user’s
browser, so that when the user subsequently accesses the
associated service speciﬁc content is promoted. We illus-
trate how an attacker can pollute a user’s history to pro-
mote certain content across three platforms. While our
attack is simple, its impact can be signiﬁcant if enough
users’ histories are compromised.
As personalization algorithms and mechanisms in-
creasingly control our interactions with the Internet, it is
inevitable that they will become the targets of ﬁnancially
motivated attacks. While we demonstrate pollution at-
tacks on only YouTube, Google, and Amazon, we believe
that our methods are general and can be widely applied to
services that leverage personalization technologies, such
as Facebook, Twitter, Netﬂix, Pandora, etc. The attacks
we present here are just the ﬁrst few examples of poten-
tially many possible attacks on personalization. With in-
creasingly complex algorithms and data collection mech-
anisms aiming for ever higher ﬁnancial stakes, there are
bound to be vulnerabilities that will be exploited by moti-
vated attackers. The age of innocence for personalization
is over; we must now face the challenge of securing it.

A Appendix
Here we provide more details regarding the actual exploit
and test corpora for the search personalization attack.
A.1 Search Term Variance
As with the various product categories on Amazon, it is
reasonable to expect that the effectiveness of search his-
tory pollution depends on the value of the search term
being polluted. In other words, just as Amazon tightly
controls the gift cards it recommends, it might be the case
that a website cannot be promoted in Google’s search re-
sults as easily for a highly competitive search term, such
as “laptop”, as it can for relatively uncontested search
terms. To obtain an estimate of the value of differ-
ent search terms, we again turned to Google’s AdWords
Keyword Tool. The tool provides a function that asso-
ciates a given search term with a level of competition.
The competition level is a measure of how expensive
it would be for URL to consistently pay enough to be
ranked at the top of the list of advertisers for a particular
search term. Competition level is expressed as a value
from 0 to 1, with 0 having no competition and 1 having
ﬁerce competition.
Recall that out of the 2,136 webpages that we at-
tempted to promote using a contextual pollution attack,
729 were successful. It is important to note that some
of the promoted results were for the same initial search
terms. Therefore, the number of search terms asso-
ciated with the webpages are 1,740 and 606, respec-
tively. As an example, we attempted to promote both
made-in-china.com and DHgate.com with respect to

the original search term “watch”. The keywords injected
by the pollution attack differ, however, and are “China”
and “China wholesale” respectively. For the persistent
attacks, we were successful in promoting at least one re-
turned website for 247 out of the 551 search terms.
Figure 12 shows the competition level distribution for
both types of attacks. Figures 12(a) and 12(b) corre-
spond to the 1,740 search terms associated with our en-
tire contextual test corpus and the 606 search terms for
which there was a website we could promote. Like-
wise, Figures 12(c) and 12(d) plot the competitiveness
of the search terms for the 551 tested and the 247 suc-
cessful persistent pollution attacks. Although the distri-
butions are different between test corpora, in both cases,
the distributions suggest there is no obvious correlation
between search term competition or value and the like-
lihood of being able to launch a search history pollution
attack.
A.2 Robustness
Because a contextual history pollution attack uses only
a few recent search history entries to promote a website,
the lifetime of this attack is limited to the period when
Google’s personalization algorithm considers this con-
textual information. We empirically determine Google’s
timeout threshold by injecting sets of contextual key-
words into a Google search proﬁle and then pausing
Google’s history collection. We then search alternatively
for two distinct search terms—one that we know is af-
fected by the injected keywords, and another we know is
not. We continue to search for these two terms, recording
and time stamping all the search returns.
Our analysis of many such tests with different sets
of search terms indicates that Google appears to en-
force a ten-minute threshold on context-based personal-
ized search, which thereby limits the scope of the con-
textual pollution attack. Similarly, there are limits on
how many different searches can be conducted before the

injected context is no longer used to personalize subse-
quent queries. Our initial testing indicates that person-
alization falls off after the fourth search. Hence, we
conclude that the pollution attack can last for at most
four subsequent queries or ten minutes, whichever comes
ﬁrst.
Our testing of persistent attacks shows that if a web-
page remains promoted after several search terms, it will
remain promoted for a long time. To determine how
long, we identiﬁed a set of 100 webpages and search
terms on which we launch a successful persistent pol-
lution attack. We then inject additional randomly se-
lected trending keywords one-by-one and continually
check whether the promotion remains. 72% of the web-
sites remain promoted after 60 additional keywords, indi-
cating that, when successful, persistent pollution attacks
are likely to remain effective for quite some time.
