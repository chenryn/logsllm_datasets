### Potential Impacts and Defenses Against Pollution Attacks

Pollution attacks have the potential to significantly impact personalized services. Our specific pollution attacks, while effective, are relatively fragile, as each service can take simple steps to defend against them.

#### Defense Mechanism: Cross-Site Request Forgery Tokens
One possible defense against pollution attacks is the use of tokens issued by the website for each request. This approach can prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) by ensuring that requests must carry these tokens. However, enforcing this constraint also hinders the ability of third-party sites to harvest information and behaviors for personalization, thereby limiting the current trend of extensive data collection for improved personalization. As a result, some websites may need to consider the trade-offs between security and the benefits of personalization.

#### YouTube's Defense Strategy
YouTube, in particular, uses two separate HTTP requests to track a user's viewing activity, independent of the video streaming process. A straightforward defense against pollution attacks is to monitor the time interval between these two HTTP requests. If the interval is substantially less than the length of the video, YouTube can ignore the signal. While this method can be bypassed by an attacker who injects a short video or controls the timing of the HTTP requests, it still provides a basic level of protection. Additionally, we observed that a short injected video can promote multiple longer videos, further complicating the defense.

#### Effectiveness of Pollution Attacks on Amazon
Figure 10 illustrates the cumulative promotion rates across varying product ranks for different Amazon pollution attacks. The cumulative success rate for a given range of product rankings is defined as the ratio of the number of successfully promoted products to the number of target products in that range. As the target product decreases in popularity (i.e., has a higher ranking position within its category), pollution attacks become less effective. This phenomenon reflects a limitation of Amazon's recommendation algorithms rather than our attack. Products with low rankings may not be purchased as often, leading to weak co-visit and co-purchase relationships with other products. Our preliminary investigation found that products ranked 2,000 or higher within their category have at least a 50% chance of being promoted by a visit-based pollution attack, and products ranked 10,000 or higher have at least a 30% chance of being promoted using search-based attacks.

### Related Work

To the best of our knowledge, the most closely related work to ours is black-hat search engine optimization (bSEO). Although bSEO shares a common goal with search history pollution—illicitly promoting website rankings in search results—it follows a completely different approach by exploiting a search engine's reliance on crawled web content. Techniques that address bSEO are unlikely to be effective against pollution attacks. On the other hand, because bSEO targets the general indexing and ranking process inside search engines, any successfully promoted website will be visible to all search engine users, potentially significantly boosting the volume of incoming traffic. Effective bSEO campaigns typically involve support from various sources.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present a new attack on personalized services that exploits the fact that these services use a user's past history to customize content. Our attack pollutes a user's history by using CSRF to stealthily inject and execute a set of targeted browsing activities in the user's browser, so that when the user subsequently accesses the associated service, specific content is promoted. We illustrate how an attacker can pollute a user's history to promote certain content across three platforms: YouTube, Google, and Amazon. While our attack is simple, its impact can be significant if enough users' histories are compromised.

As personalization algorithms and mechanisms increasingly control our interactions with the Internet, it is inevitable that they will become the targets of financially motivated attacks. While we demonstrate pollution attacks on only YouTube, Google, and Amazon, we believe that our methods are general and can be widely applied to services that leverage personalization technologies, such as Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Pandora, etc. The attacks we present here are just the first few examples of potentially many possible attacks on personalization. With increasingly complex algorithms and data collection mechanisms aiming for ever higher financial stakes, there are bound to be vulnerabilities that will be exploited by motivated attackers. The age of innocence for personalization is over; we must now face the challenge of securing it.

### Appendix

#### A.1 Search Term Variance
The effectiveness of search history pollution depends on the value of the search term being polluted. For example, it might be more difficult to promote a website for a highly competitive search term like "laptop" compared to a less contested term. To estimate the value of different search terms, we used Google's AdWords Keyword Tool, which provides a competition level from 0 to 1, with 0 having no competition and 1 having fierce competition.

Out of the 2,136 webpages we attempted to promote using a contextual pollution attack, 729 were successful. Some of the promoted results were for the same initial search terms, resulting in 1,740 unique search terms and 606 unique successful search terms. For persistent attacks, we were successful in promoting at least one returned website for 247 out of the 551 search terms. Figure 12 shows the competition level distribution for both types of attacks, indicating no obvious correlation between search term competition and the likelihood of a successful pollution attack.

#### A.2 Robustness
A contextual history pollution attack uses a few recent search history entries to promote a website, but the lifetime of this attack is limited to the period when Google’s personalization algorithm considers this contextual information. Our empirical testing indicates that Google enforces a ten-minute threshold on context-based personalized search, limiting the scope of the contextual pollution attack. Similarly, personalization falls off after the fourth search. Therefore, the pollution attack can last for at most four subsequent queries or ten minutes, whichever comes first.

For persistent attacks, if a webpage remains promoted after several search terms, it will remain promoted for a long time. We identified a set of 100 webpages and search terms on which we launched a successful persistent pollution attack. After injecting additional randomly selected trending keywords one-by-one, 72% of the websites remained promoted after 60 additional keywords, indicating that, when successful, persistent pollution attacks are likely to remain effective for quite some time.
