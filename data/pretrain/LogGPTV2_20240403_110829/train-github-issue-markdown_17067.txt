### Error Report

**Error 1:**
```
Failed to resolve: annotationProcessor
```

**Error 2:**
```
Failed to resolve: com.android.support:support-annotations:26.0.2
```

**Project Configuration:**
- `compileSdkVersion`: 25
- `buildToolsVersion`: 25.0.3

**Dependencies:**
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.1.1'
implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:okhttp3-integration:4.1.1@aar'
annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.1.1'
```

### Analysis and Recommendations

1. **Mismatched Support Library Version:**
   - The error indicates that the support library version `26.0.2` cannot be resolved, but your `compileSdkVersion` is set to 25. Ensure that the support library version matches the `compileSdkVersion`.
   - Update the support library version to match the `compileSdkVersion`:
     ```groovy
     implementation 'com.android.support:support-annotations:25.3.1'
     ```

2. **Incorrect Use of `annotationProcessor`:**
   - The first error suggests that `annotationProcessor` is not recognized. This might be due to a typo or incorrect usage.
   - Ensure that you are using the correct configuration for `annotationProcessor`. In Gradle, it should be used as follows:
     ```groovy
     annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.1.1'
     ```

3. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Replace `compile` with `implementation` (or `api` if needed) in your dependencies to align with the latest Gradle practices.
   - Example:
     ```groovy
     implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.1.1'
     implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:okhttp3-integration:4.1.1@aar'
     annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.1.1'
     ```

4. **Sync Project with Gradle Files:**
   - After making these changes, sync your project with the Gradle files to ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the errors and successfully build your project.
