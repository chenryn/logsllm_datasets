Hi everyone,
Sorry in advance if it's duplicated. Feel free to link me to the original
issue
# Bug report
getInitialProps is called but doesn't return any props
## To Reproduce
I'm using a combination of all of the examples listed below :
  * custom-server-express
  * with-next-css
  * with-next-routes
  * with-react-i18next
  * with-redux
## Expected behavior
Returning the props and access them in the render method and all the other
lifecycle methods
## Code
My routes are declared in /src/routes.js and it looks like this
    const routes = require('next-routes')
    module.exports = routes()
      .add({ name: 'HomePage', pattern: '/', page: '/Home/Home' })
      .add('test')
and here is the code of my homepage in /src/pages/Home/Home
    class HomePage extends Component {
      static async getInitialProps({ reduxStore, query, req }) {
        const isServer = !!req
        if (isServer) {
          const locale = utils.parseLanguage(req.headers['accept-language'])
          const device = utils.parseUA(req.headers['user-agent'])
          const { pathname } = utils.parseUrl(req.url)
          await Promise.all([
            reduxStore.dispatch(detectDeviceType(device)),
            reduxStore.dispatch(updateAppRoute({ pathname, query })),
            reduxStore.dispatch(fetchChartsWeek(locale)),
            reduxStore.dispatch(fetchTrendings(locale)),
          ])
        }
        return { isServer, query }
      }
      componentDidMount() {
        console.log(this.props) // everything i need but no query or isServer...
a simpler exemple in /src/pages/test.js
      static async getInitialProps({ req }) {
        const isServer = !!req
        return { isServer }
      }
      render() {
        console.log(this.props) // {}
I really need to know whether the page is being rendered by the server or the
client as i don't want to show placeholders when it is SSR and only display
them when we naviguate to the page client side, so that in componentDidMount i
would like to show placeholders and fetch data only when isServer = false if
that makes sense.
Does anyone already accountered this issue ?  
I really would like to switch to Nextjs. Currently we have our code base
running in a CRA setup. We now have trouble with SEO so switching to nextjs
seemed to be a great solution. However it is those kind of issues that are
keeping me from adopting it completely :(
Any help or suggestions would be really appreciated
Thanks in advance
