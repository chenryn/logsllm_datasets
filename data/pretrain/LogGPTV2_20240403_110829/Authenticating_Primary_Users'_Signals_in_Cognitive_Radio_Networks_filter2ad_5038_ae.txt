3) Trade off between Probability of False Alarm and
Probability of False Negative: We derive the trade off be-
tween the probability PF A of false alarm and the probability
PF N of false negative by analyzing the relationship between
PF A (PF N ) and thresholds. Table II shows the result. To
achieve a 0.05 probability of false alarm, the probability
of false negative is less than 0.3188, which is actually a
loose upper bound. In our experiment, we use the node
closest to the primary user to approximate the helper node;
there is indeed an unnecessarily long distance between the
primary user and its helper node. Thus, the probability of
false negative is unnecessarily large in our experiment.
Note that all PF N ’s are less than the same value 0.0241
for k = 1. This is because the threshold ranges between
0.6282 and 0.6816 when 0.05 ≤ PF A ≤ 0.2. This range is
quite narrow, and we can only ﬁnd a single PF N from the
empirical CDF of the attackers’ link differences. Similarly,
all PF N s are less than the same value 0.0240 for k = 2.
VIII. IMPLEMENTATION
We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach
using a prototype implementation on Universal Software Ra-
dio Peripherals (USRPs) based on GNUradio [1]. Although
wireless signals transmitted by USRPs may not exhibit the
multipath properties due to low bandwidths, low power,
and short range communication with USRPs, the prototype
implementation nevertheless demonstrates the feasibility of

integrating cryptographic signatures and link signatures for
authenticating primary users’ signals in CRNs.
A USRP is a radio frequency (RF) front end that has an
analog to digital (AD) and a digital to analog (DA) converter,
which can achieve an input and output sampling rate up to 64
Mb/s and 128 Mb/s, respectively. GNUradio is a software
toolkit consisting of signal processing blocks that can be
used to implement software radios on readily-available, low-
cost external RF hardware and commodity processors (e.g.,
USRPs) [1].
We connect one USRP to a Lenovo X61 laptop (1.80 GHz
Intel Core Duo CPU), and one USRP to a DELL machine
(3.40 GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU) via USB 2.0 links. Both
computers are running Linux (Ubuntu 9.04) and GNUradio
(version 3.2.2), and both USRPs employ XCVR2450 daugh-
ter boards as transceivers. We implement the helper node and
the secondary user applications using GNUradio toolkit, and
install the helper node and the secondary user application on
the laptop and the DELL machine, respectively.
The helper node application generates signed packets
using the method described in Section VI-A, where we
employed MD5 as the one-way function and RSA as the
cryptographic signature algorithm. The signed packets are
modulated into physical
layer symbols by a differential
binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) modulator. Then all
physical layer symbols enter a pulse shape ﬁlter, which trans-
forms those symbols into baseband signals. The baseband
signals are delivered to the USRP, converted into RF signals,
and ﬁnally transmitted to the wireless channel through the
antenna.
Upon capturing a RF signal, the secondary user applica-
tion down-converts the RF signal into baseband signal. Then
the baseband signal is recorded and delivered to a DBPSK
demodulator. If the output of the demodulator can pass the
veriﬁcation, the secondary user reconstructs the transmitted
signal from the demodulation output, and computes the 512-
points complex Fourier transform F1 and F2 of the baseband
signal and the transmitted signal, respectively. Finally, F1 is
multiplied by the conjugate of F2, and the inverse Fourier
transformation is used to calculate the link signature as
described in the Appendix.
In our experiment, the packet length is 75 bytes, the bit
rate is 2Mbit/s, and the carrier frequency is 5GHz. The
laptop and the Dell machine are used as the transmitter and
the receiver, respectively. We ﬁrst put the transmitter about 5
meters away from the receiver, and let the transmitter send a
signed packet to the receiver. Upon reception of the packet,
the receiver veriﬁes the cryptographic signature in the packet
and measures the link signature. Then we move the trans-
mitter to position a and position b, which is about 0.5 meter
and 15 meters away from the old position, respectively.
At both positions, we let the transmitter transmit signed
packets to the receiver. Figure 16 displays the measured
link signatures for different positions, we observe that the
link signatures of the old position and position a are mixed
together, and the link signature of position b greatly deviates
from the mixed ones. This observation is consistent with our
analytical result.

In our approach, generating signatures, verifying sig-
natures, computing Fourier transform, and inverse Fourier
transform are four major operations that are indispensable.
To get an intuitive feeling of the computational overhead
introduced by these operations, we did an experiment using
the prototype system to test
the computation time. We
let the transmitter transmits 1,000 packets to the receiver
every 0.1 second, and record the computation time by those
operations.
Note that the transmitter (or the receiver) only needs to
generate (or verify) the cryptographic signature sig(r0) in
the ﬁrst packet. For all the following packets, the transmitter
signs them by simply appending sig(r0) and the correspond-
ing hash values to them, and the receiver veriﬁes them by
computing and comparing hash values. Table III shows the
time costs of signing (verifying) those packets. In practice,
the calculation of link signatures can be performed more
efﬁciently with Fourier transform implemented on special
hardware (e.g., Virtex 2 Pro 50 Fast Fourier transform
(FFT) core, which can ﬁnish the 512 points complex Fourier
transform with in less than 5.5 microseconds).

[34], [37]). Traditional detection techniques in general can
be categorized into energy detection (e.g., [30]) and fea-
ture detection (e.g., [12], [25], [26], [29], [37]). In energy
detection, any captured signal whose energy exceeds a
threshold is identiﬁed as a primary user’s signal. In feature
detection, signal features (e.g., pilot, synchronization words,
and cyclostationarity) are extracted and used to detect the
presence of a primary user’s signal. However, those tradi-
tional techniques will fail in hostile environments, where
an attacker transmits with large power or mimics a primary
user’s signal features to gain unfair share of the bandwidth.
A recent attempt considered the security aspects of pri-
mary detection and proposed to utilize RSS-based loca-
tion distinction for detecting primary users’ signals in the
presence of attackers [4]. Speciﬁcally, a secondary user
veriﬁes whether a received signal is from a primary user
or not by estimating the location of the signal source. If
the estimation result deviates from the known location of
the primary user, it is highly possible that the signal is
sent by an attacker. However, as indicated in [23], RSS-
based location distinction approach, which is used in [4],
can be easily disrupted if the attacker is equipped with array
antennas. Moreover, such an approach requires multi-node
collaboration, which is expensive in terms of bandwidth and
energy.
In our work, we designed a primary user detection scheme
by exploiting link signatures, which do not have the weak-
ness of RSS based location distinction and achieve a higher
accuracy [23], [38]. We integrate cryptographic and wireless
link signatures to authenticate a primary user’s signal, and
use two levels of detections (i.e., detection at a helper and at
a secondary user) to address the technical challenges caused
by adopting link signatures in CRNs.
There are other related works, including cooperative fea-
ture detection or energy detection [11], [21], [28], [36],
secure data fusion in the presence of false information for
distributed spectrum sensing [5], [35], performance evalu-
ation of primary user detection in IEEE 802.22 [7], trade
off between a secondary user’s data transmission and the
detection of a primary user’s signal [16], and IEEE 802.22
standard for CRNs [8], [9]. These works are complementary
to ours.
IX. RELATED WORK
X. CONCLUSION
Primary user detection has been intensively studied in
the past few years (e.g., [12], [17], [25], [26], [29], [30],
In this paper, we developed a novel approach for authen-
ticating primary users’ signals in CRNs, which conforms to
FCC’s requirement. Our approach integrates cryptographic
signatures and wireless link signatures to enable primary
user detection in the presence of attackers. Essential
to
our approach is a helper node placed physically close to
each primary user, which serves as a “bridge” to enable a
secondary user to verify the cryptographic signature carried
by the helper node’s signals, and then obtain the helper
node’s authentic link signatures to verify the primary user’s
signals. A key contribution in our paper is a novel physical
layer authentication technique that enables the helper node
to authenticate signals from its associated primary user.
Unlike previous techniques for link signatures, our approach
explores the geographical proximity of the helper node to the
primary user, and thus does not require any training process.
We have examined the proposed approach through theo-
retical analysis, experimental evaluation using the CRAW-
DAD data set [22], and a prototype implementation on
USRPs based on GNUradio [1]. Our results indicate that the
proposed approach is a promising solution for authenticating
primary users’ signals in CRNs.

APPENDIX
In this appendix, we explain how we use the methodology
proposed in [23] to compute the link signature of the stored
κ + 1 samples.
Let r = [r(0), ..., r(κTr)] denote the samples of the
received signal r(t), where Tr is the sampling rate. Based on
the demodulation results, the secondary user can recreate the
transmitted signal s(t). Let s = [s(0), ..., s(κTr)] denote the
corresponding κ + 1 samples of the transmitted signal s(t).
Let R(iTr) and S(iTr) be the discrete Fourier transform
of r(iTr) and s(iTr), respectively. According to [23], the
link signature h = [h(0), ..., h(κTr)], which are the κ + 1
samples of h(t), can be calculated as
h(iTr) =
F −1(S∗(iTr)R(iTr)),
1
Ps
where F −1(·) denote the inverse discrete Fourier transform,
S∗(iTr) is the complex conjugate of S(iTr), and Ps =
S∗(iTr) ∗ S(iTr).
