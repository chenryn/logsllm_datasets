### Focusing on Vulnerable Systems in Patch Management

One of the key concepts in patch management is to focus on your most vulnerable systems, such as those running Windows operating systems and highly vulnerable third-party programs like Adobe Flash, Adobe Reader, and Java. By prioritizing the most risky yet mission-critical devices, you can allocate time and resources where they will be most effective and provide the greatest risk mitigation.

### Determining the Right Tools for Your Organization

The choice of patch management tools depends on several factors, including the size of your organization, the number of cybersecurity team members, the hours they can devote to patch management, and the number of systems that need to be kept up-to-date. For smaller organizations, third-party patch management software may be beneficial. Microsoft includes a tool called Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) with all Windows Server operating systems, which may be sufficient for basic needs. However, if you use other third-party applications like Adobe Flash or Java, additional tools may be necessary.

   - The agent will scan the system and identify missing patches.
   - You can manually install patches or automate and schedule the patching process.

2. **Reporting and Monitoring**:
   - Run targeted reports and graphs to monitor the patch management process.

### Lab 12.2: Setting Up the SOM and Automating Critical Patches

1. **Scope of Management**:
   - The scope refers to the list of managed computers, which can be limited to a small set or the entire domain.
   - Active Directory (AD) domains and workgroups are automatically discovered.
   - Inventory the domains and workgroups in AD to correlate with the autodiscovered ones.

2. **Viewing Discovered Domains**:
   - Go to the Admin tab, then SOM Settings, and click Scope Of Management.
   - Open the Computers tab to orchestrate the installation of agents.

3. **Download and Install the LAN Agent**:
   - Use the Download Agent option in the upper-right corner to download the zip file.
   - Unzip the file and double-click the `setup.bat` file.
   - Follow the prompts to install the agent.

4. **Patch Management**:
   - Refresh the Computers page to see the system with the installed agent.
   - Navigate to the Home menu and click Patch Management to view installed and missing patches.
   - Use the Patches icon to manage and deploy patches.

### Configuration Management

#### Introduction

Configuration management is crucial for maintaining a secure and stable environment. In 2010, I was part of a Department of Defense (DoD) contract to deploy technical assets for the newly formed Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). We developed a system using master images, an old 40-port Cisco switch, and a lot of cable to reduce deployment time from 7-10 days to about 45 minutes per machine.

#### Golden Images

A golden image, or master image, is used to clone and deploy other devices consistently. This method establishes a baseline configuration, saving countless hours per tech refresh. Our images were so good that other technicians used them to reimage machines rather than troubleshoot issues.

### Lab 12.3: Adding the Security Configuration and Analysis (SCA) Tool to the MMC

1. **Open Microsoft Management Console (MMC)**:
   - Go to the Start menu and search for `MMC`.
   - Under File, scroll down to Add/Remove Snap-In.

2. **Add SCA Tool**:
   - Select Security Configuration And Analysis and click Add.
   - Save the MMC using the Save As button.

### Lab 12.4: Comparing a Host to an .INF File

1. **Open the Customized MMC**:
   - Click the Security Configuration And Analysis option under Console Root.
   - Right-click and select Open Database.
   - Enter a new database name and import the template modified in Lab 12.3.

2. **Analyze the System**:
   - Right-click Security Configuration And Analysis and choose Analyze System Now.
   - Review the log file to see what was reconfigured successfully.

### Chapter 13: Securing OSI Layer 8

#### Human Nature and Social Engineering

Social engineering is a common and effective method for cyber attackers. Kevin Mitnick, a renowned social engineer, notes that despite significant investments in security measures, the weakest link remains the people who use, administer, and operate computer systems.

#### Principles of Persuasion

Professor Robert Cialdini's six principles of persuasion are:

1. **Reciprocity**: People tend to return favors. In IT, this can be seen in phishing attacks that offer something in return for clicking a link.
2. **Scarcity**: Creating a sense of urgency, such as in password reset emails.
3. **Authority**: Signaling credibility and knowledge, such as wearing a doctor's coat.
4. **Consistency**: Building trust through repeated interactions.
5. **Liking**: People are more likely to comply with requests from those they like.
6. **Consensus**: Following the crowd, such as in marketing and political campaigns.

#### Conclusion

Understanding and recognizing these principles can help in defending against social engineering attacks. Education and training are the best defenses, making individuals hyperaware of attempts to influence them.
