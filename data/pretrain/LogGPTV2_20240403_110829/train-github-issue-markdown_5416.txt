Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
The DOM property `dateTime` isn't converted to its lowercase attribute
counterpart `datetime` for the `` element when the element is rendered
with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()`.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem viahttps://jsfiddle.net or similar
(template for React 16: https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/, template for React 15:
https://jsfiddle.net/hmbg7e9w/).**
    const React = require('react');
    const ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server');
    const markup = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(React.createElement('time', {
    	dateTime: "2017-11-02T20:49:25+01:00"
    }));
    console.log(markup);
The above will print ``.
**What is the expected behavior?**
The above output should be ``.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
