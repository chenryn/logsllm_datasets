User: Suppose I have a script written in Python or Ruby, or a program written in C. How do I ensure that the script has no access to network capabilities?
Assistant: Unless you're using a sandboxed version of Python (using PyPy for example), there is no reliable way to switch-off network access from within the script itself.  Of course, you could run under a VM with the network access shut off.
