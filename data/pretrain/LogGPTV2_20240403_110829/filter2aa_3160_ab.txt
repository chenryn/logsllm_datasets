 From a Stringray Manual
 (Thanks to @VickerySec to finding this)
 External GPS - Sometimes an external GPS device will emit erroneous GPS 
ticks, causing the Gemini activation license to expire.

 What can we do if we have access to the data centre roof?
 GPS unit with aerial on roof serial down
 GPS unit in server and radio down wire from roof
 Attach transmitter to wire with attenuator
 Use server 127.0.20.0
 ntpd then knows to look at /dev/gps0 and /dev/pps0 for 
import

Doesn’t contain time value
It indicates where a second starts
Less processing on the GPS Receiver so 
comes through in a more timely manner
Rising edge can be in micro or nano
second accuracy

I had NTPd running on a raspberry pi
GPS receiver via UART serial on GPIO 
pins
One wire was for PPS
NTP Setup
58
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
Link the PPS pin to another GPIO pin
Set that pin high and low as applicable
How to spoof PPS
59
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
If run PPS with a different timing the NEMA data 
will keep correcting 
So will keep pulling it back 
So within ±1 second
Maybe an issue in finance, telecoms and energy
Where fractions of a second count
So what happens
60
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
If pull serial NTPd Tx wire
Stops the source in NTPd, even if getting 
PPS signal
So can’t manipulate time just through PPS 
manipulation 
Can we just remove the NMEA data?
61
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
 Python Script
 Moves time back in steps
 So as not to crash NTPd

@nzkarit
 Similar in concept to tardgps
 Though changing the data in the NMEA data rather than GPS Signal
 Adjust the time
 Adjust how fast a second is
 Also does the PPS generation
 Offers more control than tardgps
 No GPS signal tom foolery

ntpd takes it from there

I could get similar behaviour as tardgps
But simpler to execute as don’t have the 
radio aspect
Though will require physical access to the

 If jumped time a large amount forward
 It just worked 
 Didn’t need TardGPS
 Backwards did require TardGPS or NMEADesync
 Behaved like NTPd earlier
So what did it do?

 3+ Upstream
 Allows for bad ticker detection and removal
 Multiple Types of upstream
 I.e. don’t pick 3 GPS based ones
 GPS, Atomic
 Don’t pick just one upstream provider
 Rouge admin problem
 Maybe one overseas so gives you a coarse sanity check of 
time
NTP Setups to avoid GPS Spoofing

But GPS is travelling across the air…
Consider atomic, caesium, rubidium  
“Air gapped” networks
85
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
Incorporate GPSnitch
Additional logging for when daemon shuts 
down due to a time jump
On daemon restart after a large time 
jump occurs, prompt user to accept time 
jump
Changes for NTPd or NTP Server
