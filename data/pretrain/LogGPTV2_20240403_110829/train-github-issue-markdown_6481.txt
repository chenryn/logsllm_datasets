**Issue with Compiling TensorFlow on MacBook**

I am attempting to compile TensorFlow on my MacBook, but I consistently encounter the same error. When I run the following command:

```bash
bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```

I receive the following error message:

```
/private/var/tmp/_bazel_cagrigider/2c548436011ab6b7308cd0cc70a91ed3/external/bazel_tools/tools/cpp/BUILD:3:1: 
invalid license type: 'notice'
```

Here are the details of my environment:
- **Operating System:** macOS 10.13.3
- **Xcode Version:** 9.2
- **TensorFlow Version:** 1.8
- **Bazel Version:** 0.13.0

Below is the full terminal output for reference:
