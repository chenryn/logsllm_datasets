### Abstract
Mobile fitness tracking applications allow users to monitor and share their workouts via online social networks. While sharing personal data is a common risk in all social networks, the potential dangers associated with sharing geospatial and health data are particularly significant. Although these apps offer various privacy features, it remains unclear whether these measures are sufficient to protect against determined attackers, and how many users are at risk.

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of privacy behaviors and threats in fitness tracking social networks. We collected a month-long dataset of public posts from a popular fitness tracking service (21 million posts, 3 million users) and found that 16.5% of users utilize Endpoint Privacy Zones (EPZs), which conceal activity near sensitive locations such as home or office. We developed an attack that infers protected locations from the remaining information in public posts, revealing that 95.1% of moderately active users are at risk of having their sensitive locations exposed. We also evaluated the effectiveness of state-of-the-art privacy mechanisms, including geo-indistinguishability techniques and a novel EPZ fuzzing technique. The affected companies have been notified of the vulnerabilities and have incorporated our proposed countermeasures into their systems.

### 1. Introduction
Fitness tracking applications like Strava and MapMyRide are increasingly popular, allowing users to record and share their activities via GPS-based self-tracking. These apps sync to a social network where users can track their progress and share activities with others, often using leaderboards for popular routes. While sharing personal data is inherently risky in any social network, the unique risks associated with fitness apps include the sharing of geospatial and temporal information, health data, and lists of valuable equipment.

In January 2018, Strava's global heat map revealed the precise locations of classified military bases, highlighting the significant privacy and security risks. In response, Strava pointed to its privacy protection mechanisms, such as Endpoint Privacy Zones (EPZs), which conceal activity within a specified distance of sensitive locations. However, it is unclear if these features are widely used and effective.

In this work, we systematically analyze privacy threats in fitness tracking social networks. We survey the market to identify privacy mechanisms, formalize an attack on EPZs, and evaluate the privacy habits of users using a dataset from Strava. Our findings show that 95.1% of regular users are at risk of having their sensitive locations exposed. We also test the effectiveness of state-of-the-art privacy enhancements and develop new techniques to improve user privacy.

### 2. Fitness Tracking Social Networks
Services like Strava provide users with the ability to track and share their outdoor activities, leveraging mobile device sensors to collect data such as altitude and heart rate. Users can publish activities to their profiles, create and share recommended routes, and compete on leaderboards. These services also include social networking features, allowing users to follow each other and view additional information, such as a list of owned equipment.

Given the sensitivity of the shared information, these services offer various privacy mechanisms. We surveyed eight popular fitness networks and identified common features, including:

- **Private Profiles/Activities:** Users can make their posts or profiles private, though hidden activities are not counted towards challenges or leaderboards.
- **Block Users:** Users can block others, but this offers limited utility as posts are public by default on many services.
- **Endpoint Privacy Zone (EPZ):** This feature obfuscates routes within a certain distance of a specified location, such as home or office.

### 3. Methodology
We collected a month-long dataset of public posts from Strava, analyzed the use of EPZs, and developed an attack to infer protected locations. We also evaluated the effectiveness of existing privacy mechanisms and proposed new techniques, such as EPZ fuzzing.

### 4. Results
Our analysis shows that 16.5% of users use EPZs, but 95.1% of moderately active users are at risk of having their sensitive locations exposed. We tested our attack on data from other popular fitness apps, such as Garmin Connect and Map My Tracks, and found similar results. Our proposed privacy enhancements, including geo-indistinguishability and EPZ fuzzing, can improve user privacy, but there is an inherent tension between sharing route information and concealing sensitive endpoints.

### 5. Conclusion
Our contributions include demonstrating privacy leakage in fitness apps, characterizing the privacy behaviors of users, developing new privacy extensions, and disclosing vulnerabilities to affected companies. These findings highlight the need for further research and the implementation of more robust privacy protections in fitness tracking social networks.
