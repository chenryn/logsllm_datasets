Abstract
Mobile ﬁtness tracking apps allow users to track their
workouts and share them with friends through online so-
cial networks. Although the sharing of personal data
is an inherent risk in all social networks, the dangers
presented by sharing personal workouts comprised of
geospatial and health data may prove especially grave.
While ﬁtness apps offer a variety of privacy features, at
present it is unclear if these countermeasures are sufﬁ-
cient to thwart a determined attacker, nor is it clear how
many of these services’ users are at risk.
In this work, we perform a systematic analysis of
privacy behaviors and threats in ﬁtness tracking social
networks. Collecting a month-long snapshot of pub-
lic posts of a popular ﬁtness tracking service (21 mil-
lion posts, 3 million users), we observe that 16.5% of
users make use of Endpoint Privacy Zones (EPZs), which
conceal ﬁtness activity near user-designated sensitive lo-
cations (e.g., home, ofﬁce). We go on to develop an
attack against EPZs that infers users’ protected loca-
tions from the remaining available information in pub-
lic posts, discovering that 95.1% of moderately active
users are at risk of having their protected locations ex-
tracted by an attacker. Finally, we consider the efﬁcacy
of state-of-the-art privacy mechanisms through adapting
geo-indistinguishability techniques as well as developing
a novel EPZ fuzzing technique. The affected companies
have been notiﬁed of the discovered vulnerabilities and
at the time of publication have incorporated our proposed
countermeasures into their production systems.

Introduction
Fitness tracking applications such as Strava [23] and
MapMyRide [1] are growing increasingly popular, pro-
viding users with a means of recording the routes of
their cycling, running, and other activities via GPS-based

self-tracking [44]). These apps sync to
tracking (i.e.,
a social network that provides users with the ability to
track their progress and share their ﬁtness activities with
other users. The ability to share ﬁtness activities is an es-
sential ingredient to the success of these services, moti-
vating users to better themselves through shared account-
ability with friends and even compete with one another
via leaderboards that are maintained for popular routes.
Although the sharing of personal data is an inherent
risk in all social networks [42, 45, 48, 53, 56], there are
unique risks associated with the data collected by ﬁtness
apps, where users share geospatial and temporal infor-
mation about their daily routines, health data, and lists of
valuable exercise equipment. While these services have
previously been credited as a source of information for
bicycle thieves (e.g., [6, 17]), the true risk of sharing this
data came to light in January 2018 when Strava’s global
heat map was observed to reveal the precise locations of
classiﬁed military bases, CIA rendition sites, and intel-
ligence agencies [24]. Fitness activity is thus not only a
matter of personal privacy, but in fact is “data that most
intelligence agencies would literally kill to acquire” [46].
In response to public criticism over the global heat
map incident, Strava has pointed to the availability of
a variety of privacy protection mechanisms as a means
for users to safeguard their accounts [50] – in addition
to generic privacy settings, domain-speciﬁc mechanisms
such as Endpoint Privacy Zones (EPZs) conceal ﬁtness
activity that occurs within a certain distance of sensitive
user locations such as homes or work places [15, 16, 13].
However, at present it is unclear if such features are
widely used among athletes, nor is it clear that these
countermeasures are adequate to prevent attackers from
discovering the private locations of users.
In this work, we perform a systematic analysis of pri-
vacy threats in ﬁtness tracking social networks. We begin
by surveying the ﬁtness app market to identify classes of
privacy mechanisms. Using these insights, we then for-
malize an attack against the Endpoint Privacy Zones fea-

ture. To characterize the privacy habits of users, we col-
lect a month-long activity dataset of public posts from
Strava, an exemplar ﬁtness tracking service. We next
use this dataset to evaluate our EPZ attack, discovering
that 95.1% of regular Strava users are at risk of having
their homes and other sensitive locations exposed. We
demonstrate the generality of this result by replicating
our attack against data collected from two other popular
ﬁtness apps, Garmin Connect and Map My Tracks.
These ﬁndings demonstrate privacy risks in the state-
of-the-practice for ﬁtness apps, but do not speak to the
state-of-the-art of location privacy research.
In a ﬁnal
series of experiments, we leverage our Strava dataset
to test the effectiveness of privacy enhancements that
have been proposed in the literature [26, 27]. We ﬁrst
evaluate the EPZ radius obfuscation proposed by [27].
Next, we adapt spatial cloaking techniques [41] for use
in ﬁtness tracking services in order to provide geo-
indistinguishability [26] within the radius of the EPZ.
Lastly, we use insights from our attack formalization to
develop a new privacy enhancement that randomizes the
boundary of the EPZ in order to conceal protected lo-
cations. While user privacy can be improved by these
techniques, our results point to an intrinsic tension that
exists within applications seeking to share route infor-
mation and simultaneously conceal sensitive end points.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• Demonstrate Privacy Leakage in Fitness Apps. We
formalize and demonstrate a practical attack on the
EPZ privacy protection mechanism. We test our at-
tack against real-world EPZ-enabled activities to de-
termine that 84% of users making use of EPZs unwit-
tingly reveal their sensitive locations in public activity
posts. When considering only moderate and highly
active users, the detection rate rises to 95.1%.
• Characterize Privacy Behaviors of Fitness App Users.
We collect and analyze 21 million activities represent-
ing a month of Strava usage. We characterize demo-
graphic information for users and identify a signiﬁcant
demand for privacy protections by 16.5%, motivating
the need for further study in this area.
• Develop Privacy Extensions.
Leveraging our
dataset of public activity posts, we evaluate the effec-
tiveness of state-of-the-art privacy enhancements (e.g.,
geo-indistinguishability [26]) for solving problems in
ﬁtness tracking services, and develop novel protec-
tions based on insights gained from this study.
• Vulnerability Disclosure. We have disclosed these
results to the affected ﬁtness tracking services (Strava,
Garmin Connect, and Map My Tracks). All companies
have acknowledged the vulnerability and have incor-
porated one or more of our proposed countermeasures
into their production systems.1
2 Fitness Tracking Social Networks
Popularized by services such as Strava [23], ﬁtness track-
ing apps provide users the ability to track their outdoor
ﬁtness activities (e.g., running) and share those activi-
ties with friends as well as other users around the world.
Leveraging common sensors in mobile devices, these
services track users’ movements alongside other met-
rics, such as the altitude of the terrain they are travers-
ing. After completing a ﬁtness activity, users receive a
detailed breakdown of their activities featuring statistics
such as distance traveled. If the user pairs a ﬁtness moni-
tor (e.g., Fitbit [3]) to the service, the activity can also be
associated with additional health metrics including heart
rate. Beyond publishing activities to user proﬁles, ﬁt-
ness tracking services also offer the ability for users to
create and share recommended routes (segments). Each
segment is associated with a leaderboard that records the
speed with which each user completed it. Most ﬁtness
tracking services also contain a social network platform
through which users can follow each other [12, 18, 23].

ethical considerations of this work can be found in Section 9.

popular ﬁtness tracking services. #D/Ls: downloads (in mil-

Followers are granted additional access to user informa-
tion that may not be publicly available, such as the list of
equipment that the user owns.
As is evident from the features described above, ﬁt-
ness tracking services share a variety of highly sensitive
user information, including spatial and temporal where-
abouts, health data, and a list of valuable equipment that
is likely to be found in those locations. Recognizing the
sensitivity of this information, these services offer a va-
riety of privacy mechanisms to protect their users. We
conducted a survey of privacy mechanisms across 8 pop-
ular ﬁtness networks, and present a taxonomy of these
features in Table 1. Popular mechanisms include:
F1 Private Proﬁles/Activities: As is common across
many social networks, users have the ability to make
their posts or proﬁles private. Depending on the ser-
vice, users can elect to make all activities private or
do so on a case-by-case basis. However, hidden ac-
tivities are not counted towards challenges or segment
leaderboards, incentivizing users to make their activ-
ities public. Of the surveyed services, only Garmin
Connect enables private activities by default.
F2 Block Users: Like other social networks, users have
the ability to block other users, removing them from
their follower’s list, and preventing them from viewing
their activities or contacting them. However, as posts
are public by default on many services, the ability to
block a user offers limited utility.
F3 Endpoint Privacy Zone: Since users will often start
their activities at sensitive locations, several services
allow users the option to obfuscate routes within a cer-
tain distance of a speciﬁed location. In this paper, we
refer to this general mechanism as an Endpoint Pri-
vacy Zone (EPZ) [15].
If an activity starts or ends
within an EPZ, the service will hide the portion of the
user’s route within the EPZ region from being viewed
by other users. We provide a formal deﬁnition of an
EPZ in Section 3. An example is shown in Figure
1; after enabling an EPZ, the full route (Fig. 1a) is
(a) With fewer activities, there are multiple possible EPZs.
(b) As activities increase, possible EPZs are eliminated.
Figure 2: Simpliﬁed activity examples that demonstrate the in-
tuition behind our EPZ identiﬁcation approach. Red lines rep-
resent activity routes, while circles represent possible EPZs. In
Fig. 2a, given the available routes there are multiple possible
EPZs of different radii, only one of which is correct. In Fig. 2b,
