User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I find the total number of TCP connections for a given port and period of time by IP? On a Linux system there are plenty of methods for listing the current TCP connections for a given port by connecting IP but: how can I count the total number of connections to a port per source IP for period of time?

Assistant: Turn on iptables and set it to LOG for incoming connections. Example rule:

 -A INPUT --state NEW -p tcp --dport 4711 -j LOG


(where 4711 is the port you want to track). 

Then run the resulting log through whatever script you like that can do the summary for you.
