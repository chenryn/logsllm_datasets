User: Is there no sane way to peform a scripted install of binary python packages for windows? Unfortunately it seems like several essential windows python packages like pywin32 and py2exe are only available as EXE's not MSI's (and as far as I know only the latter are scriptable). Easy_install/pip also seems no use since they apparently only find source packages and then try to compile locally which is obviously unsatisfactory.
Am I missing something?
Assistant: If you want scripted automation of installs on Windows, look into AutoIt.
