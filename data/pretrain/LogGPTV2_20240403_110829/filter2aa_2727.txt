Why a Bridge Attack 
WebView Attack in Past 
l Using addJavascriptInterface to RCE 
Ø CVE-2012-6336 
l WebView Cross-domain Risk 
Ø setAllowFileAccess 
Ø setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs 
Ø setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs 
l URL Scheme Attack 
Ø ://:/? with exported 
component 
Difference in Bridge Attack 
l More Attack Surface 
l Vulnerability effect with Bridge Ability

Bypass Identification Check 
Ø XSS attack from url  
Ø InSecure domain check(CSRF)  
Ø JS Bridge(@JavascriptInterface) Man-in-the-Middle Attack  
Insecure Check Case I

str.endsWith("safe.com")

Expolit JsBridge Ability 
Ø  Custom JsApi better or 
worse? 
Ø  Easy Web attack can csrf in 
apps

What Can we do except stealing cookie?? 
Insecure Check Case II 
Payload Question: 
Ø import js file from outer url 
Ø exec  any Sensitive JsApi 
Ø send user sensitive data to malicious url

What0Difference0in0Iot0Bridge 
Ø Penetrate LAN from WAN Attack 
-DNS Rebinding 
-Bridge Attack in Brain App 
-Other remote attack entries’ 
Ø  Persistent attack during the exploiting 
-More Broiler can be chosen in a LAN 
-More attack mode can be designed and used

Defense the Bridge Attack 
l  For Jsbridge:  
Ø  Check  identification  seriously 
Ø  Constraint the permission of bridge ability  
Ø  Ensure the communication security with encryto channel(etc. 
https)  
l  For IoTbridge:  
Ø  Same security policy with JsBridge  
Ø  Be cautious  in  expanding and abusing the bridge ability  
Ø  Make sure your command action with authentication tickets
