##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
devel (`e0147f1`)
##### Environment:
N/A
##### Summary:
When trying to restrict tasks by tags all tasks are being executed. Regardless
of the specified tags.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
Hostfile test:
    localhost   ansible_ssh_user=root
Playbook test-tags.yml:
    - hosts: localhost
      roles:
        - test-tags
/roles/test-tags/tasks/main.yml:
    - include: foo.yml
      tags: foo
    - include: bar.yml
      tags: bar
/roles/test-tags/tasks/foo.yml:
    - debug: msg="foo"
/roles/test-tags/tasks/bar.yml:
    - debug: msg="bar"
Execute playbook:
    ansible-playbook -i test test-tags.yml --tags bar --list-tasks
##### Expected Results:
    playbook: test-tags.yml
      play #1 (localhost):
        debug msg="bar" (tags: all, bar)
##### Actual Results:
    playbook: test-tags.yml
      play #1 (localhost):
        debug msg="foo" (tags: all, foo, bar)
        debug msg="bar" (tags: all, foo, bar)
Please note that I added a debug output to ansible-playbook (see PR #6434) to
see which tags are compiled for each task.  
The problem seems to be: All tags are assigned to every task. So restricting
via tag is completely useless in the current develop-branch.
