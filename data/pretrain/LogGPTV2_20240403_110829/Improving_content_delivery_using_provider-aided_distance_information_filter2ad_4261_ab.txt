other recent Internet application mix studies [24, 22, 31, 29]. Fig-
ure 2 [30] summarizes the results of these studies. Note that almost
all streaming is done via the Web on top of HTTP. Therefore, we
conclude that HTTP is the dominant service.
Analyzing HTTP-14d, we ﬁnd more than 1.2 billion HTTP re-
quests, or 89 million requests per day on average. This is consistent
with 95 million requests in 24 hours in MAR10. The advantage of
using click stream data from a large set of residential users is their
completeness. We are, e.g., not biased by the content offered (i) by
a Web service, (ii) whether sufﬁcient users installed measurement
tools such as the alexa.com toolbar, or (iii) whether users actu-
ally use some kind of Web proxy.
To identify the most popular Web services, we focus on the most
popular hosts. As expected, the distribution of host popularity by
volume as well as by number of requests is highly skewed and is
consistent with a Zipf-like distribution as observed in other stud-
ies [24]. The top 10,000 hosts by volume and the top 10,000 hosts
by number of requests together result in roughly 17,500 hosts. This
indicates that on the one hand, some hosts that are popular by vol-
ume may not be popular by number of requests and vice versa.
On the other hand, there are some hosts that are popular accord-
ing to both metrics. The total activity by these hosts accounts for
88.5 % of the overall HTTP volume and more than 84 % of the
HTTP requests. Assuming that the HTTP trafﬁc volume accounts
for roughly 60 % of the total trafﬁc, similar to the observations
made in September 2009 [24, 2] and in MAR10, more than 50 %
of the trace’s total trafﬁc is captured by these hosts.
2.2 Server Diversity and DNS Load Balancing
To better understand how HTTP requests are handled and as-
signed to servers, we use DNS-5d to analyze the 20 most heavily
queried DNS names to identify typical usage patterns. We consider
only the most heavily used resolver. Figure 3 shows two of the
typical patterns for two of the DNS names. It also shows how the
resolved IP addresses change (y-axis) across time (x-axis) for two
hostnames; respectively a software site, labeled Software1, and a
media site, labeled Media1. The vertical lines annotate midnight.
If two IP addresses are plotted close to each other, this indicates
that the longest common preﬁx of the two addresses is close. We
note that the hostname of Software1 is mainly resolved to a sin-

gle subnet, excepting a few special cases. However, Media1 is
load balanced across approximately 16 different sites. For Media1,
there appears to be one main site which is almost always available,
while the remaining 15 are predominantly used during afternoon
and evening peak usage hours.
These results are promising, and show that individual sites do
expose a certain degree of server diversity to their users. While
our trace (HTTP-14d) includes the queried hostnames, it does not
include the resolved IP address, as a HTTP request header con-
tains the hostname but not the IP address of a server. To verify the
above behavior and get an up-to-date view of the DNS replies for
the hostnames of our trace, we used 3 hosts within the ISP to issue
DNS queries to the ISP’s DNS resolver for all 17,500 hostnames
repeatedly over a fourteen day measurement period starting on Tue
Apr 13th 2010. During these two weeks, we received more than 16
million replies. Unless otherwise mentioned, we rely on our active
DNS measurements, with augmented statistics concerning volume
and requests from HTTP-14d.
2.3 Server Location Diversity
Our analysis of hostnames and their assignment to servers in sec-
tion 2.2 has shown that content can be served by multiple servers
in different locations.
In fact, many domains use the service of
a Content Delivery Service (CDS), which can be seen during the
name resolution progress: The original domain name is mapped to
the domain of a CDS, which then answers requests on behalf of
the requested domain name from one of its caches [34]. Almost
all CDSs rely on a distributed infrastructure to handle the expected
load, load spikes, ﬂash crowds, and special events. Additionally,
this introduces needed redundancy and fail over conﬁgurations in
their services. Among the most studied CDS’ are Content Distribu-
tion Networks (CDNs), such as Akamai [23, 34, 17], and Content
Delivery Platforms (CDPs), such as Google [21] and their YouTube
service [10].
To better understand the DNS resolution process for hostnames
hosted on CDS infrastructure, we refer to the machine requesting
content as the DNS client. Along the same lines, we refer to

the DNS server that receives the query from the client as the DNS
resolver. This is usually run by the ISP or a third party DNS
infrastructure like OpenDNS, also acting as a cache. Lastly, the
authoritative DNS server, henceforth referred as DNS server,
which is usually run by the CDS, replies to the DNS resolver. The
DNS resolver caches the reply and hands it back to the DNS client.
The DNS server can choose to return one or more server IP ad-
dresses based on the domain name in the request and the IP address
of the requesting DNS resolver. For example, it may use a geo-
location database [33] to localize the region of the DNS resolver,
utilize BGP data to identify the ISP, create a topology map derived
via traceroutes, or any combination of these and other topological
and geographic localization techniques. A DNS server has, in prin-
ciple, two methods for load balancing across multiple servers:
MultQuery: Can return multiple IP addresses within a single DNS
response
CrossQuery: Can return different IP addresses for repeated queries
and thus perform DNS redirection.
In our active DNS measurements, we found that often a mixture
of MultQuery and CrossQuery is being used in practice. Further-
more, we used the measurement results to (i) map hostnames to sets
of IP addresses and (ii) check the IP address diversity of these sets
for a better understanding of server diversity and their location. We
achieved this by aggregating the returned IP addresses into subnets
based on BGP information obtained from within the ISP. This al-
lows for detailed information about the different locations within
the ISP, while giving an aggregated view of subnets reachable via
peering links.
Another issue stems from the fact that the IP address returned
by the CDS depends on the IP address of the ISP DNS resolver [5,
26, 34]. Due to this, we used the DNS resolver of the ISP of our
vantage point as well as external DNS resolvers (see section 2.3.1).
The former reﬂects the experience of most of the clients at our van-
tage point1. The latter lets us discover additional diversity as well
as understand the preference of the CDS for this speciﬁc ISP.
Prevalence of MultQuery.
We start our analysis by checking the prevalence of the ﬁrst form
of DNS based load balancing, MultQuery. Figure 4 shows a CCDF
plot of the average number of IP addresses (top) and subnets (bot-
tom) per DNS reply. In addition, we included the same data nor-
malized by trafﬁc volume and number of requests.
A ﬁrst observation is that the number of returned IP addresses
per request is rather small. The median is 1, the average is 1.3
and even the 0.9 percentile is 2. We note that even when an an-
swer yields multiple IP addresses, the majority of them are from
the same subnet. Therefore, the diversity decreases even further if
we aggregate to subnets. From a network perspective, this implies
that there is not much choice, neither for the ISP nor for the user,
regarding where to download the content from. Both are limited
to the information provided by the DNS server. However, when
we normalize the hosts by their respective popularity, we see a sig-
niﬁcant improvement. More than 29% of the volume and 19% of
requests have a choice among at least 2 IP addresses.
1We verify using the traces that more than 95 % of the clients use
the ISP’s DNS resolver as their default one.

requested content from servers that match in their second level do-
main.
We note that the accumulation by third-level domain, and espe-
cially by second level domain signiﬁcantly increases the number of
observed subnets per request both normalized by requests as well
as by volume. The number of returned subnets further increases
when accumulating to the second-level domain of DNS resolver
answer. Studying our traces in more detail, we ﬁnd that this is due
to the substantial trafﬁc volume and number of requests that are
served by CDNs, some of which are highly distributed within ISPs
or located in multihomed datacenters or peer-exchange points.
Infrastructure Redirection Aggregation.
Taking a closer look at the DNS replies [25], we ﬁnd that some
CDSs use CNAME records to map queried hostname to an A record.
These A records show the same pattern as the hostnames in the pre-
vious section: the second level domain is identical. Similar to the
previous approach, we can aggregated by these A records.
For example, at some point in time the hostname www.bmw.de
is mapped via a CNAME chain to an A record with the name
a1926.b.akamai.net, while www.audi.de is mapped to
a1845.ga.akamai.net. Since the second level domain on the
A records match, these DNS replies will be aggregated. Indeed,
it has been shown that both caches will serve the content of either
website [35]. On the down side, it is possible that this scheme of
aggregation reduces the effectiveness of the CDN’s caching strat-
egy. This aggregation is called Redirection in Figures 5 and 6.
Turning our attention to the implications of the proposed aggre-
gation schemes, we notice the available diversity increases tremen-
dously. More than 50% of the hits and 70% of the bytes can be
served by more than 20 servers. With regards to subnets, the di-
versity decreases slightly. Nevertheless, more than 5 subnets are
available for 45% of the hits and 55% of the bytes.
If we consider aggregation periods in the order of tens of min-
utes, the numbers do not decrease by much. The reason that most
of the diversity is observable even over these short aggregation time
periods, is that the typical TTL, see Figure 7, is rather short with a
mean of 2, 100 seconds and an median of 300 seconds normalized
by volume. When weighted by requests, the mean is 4, 100 seconds
and the median is 300 seconds.
2.3.1 Alternative DNS Resolvers

when the ISP DNS resolver is used. To understand how much the

Prevalence of CrossQuery.
Next, we check how prevalent CrossQuery, the second form of
DNS based load balancing is. Since CrossQuery returns differ-
ent IP addresses for repeated queries, its potential contribution to
server diversity can only be studied by aggregating across time.
The lines labeled Full Domain Name in Figures 5 and 6 cap-
ture this case.
We ﬁnd that more than 50 % of the volume or requests can be
served by more than one IP address. similarly, there is choice be-
tween at least two subnets over 40 % of the time across both met-
rics, see Figure 6. This indicates that there is signiﬁcant potential
for the ISP to bias the location preference of the CDS.
Subdomain Aggregation.
Since some CDSs only use subdomains as hints about the context
of the requested URLs or the requested services, we accumulate the
answers further regarding the 2nd and 3rd part of the domain names
