Should we drop support for OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard in Go 1.5? In Go 1.6?  
It's 5 years old and not supported by Apple anymore.  
It was the last OS X to support 32-bit machines, which is why we've kept it
this long.  
But there are problems with cmd/cgo on these old systems that we're just never
going to fix (for example #8009 and #9967).
We should still keep darwin/386 until Apple stops running 32-bit binaries on
64-bit systems, since it's useful to be able to run 386 all.bash on OS X
machines.
