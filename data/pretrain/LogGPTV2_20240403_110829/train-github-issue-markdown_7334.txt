## 📝Assign a specific zone for an application window.
_What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the scenario
this would be used?_
\--- Example for this: Set a zone 1 for Google Chrome, set zone 2 for
Terminal, zone 3 for document viewer. On opening the specific app, it should
always go to the specific zone unless we override it manually by dragging it.
