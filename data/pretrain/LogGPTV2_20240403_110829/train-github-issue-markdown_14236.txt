# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement
Enable users to customize the appearance of the icon on the taskbar. While the current `>_` icon is visually appealing, it would be beneficial to allow users to assign a more distinctive and personalized icon that stands out better.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
To implement this feature, we can allow users to specify a custom icon through a file reference in a JSON configuration file. This approach will provide flexibility and ease of use for users who wish to personalize their taskbar icons. The JSON configuration could include the following structure:

```json
{
  "taskbarIcon": {
    "path": "C:\\path\\to\\custom_icon.ico"
  }
}
```

This configuration would enable the application to load and display the specified icon on the taskbar, enhancing the user's experience by allowing for greater customization.
