User: as I'm using aws I'm looking into two tutorials just to make sure I do it right. and I'm at a step to do eb init, and it asks "do you want ssh for your instance?" one tutorial says I should say yes and the other says i should put no...isn't ssh the one that connects my laptop with amazon's network shouldn't I put yes for this?but why does the tutorial say I should put no
Assistant: The advice against using ssh comes from a well-meaning bunch that wants us all to create reproducible configurations that don't require administrators to login in order to periodically tweak the config.  It also becomes another interface that must be secured.
Ideally, everything you need is independent of ssh because you are providing some internet-accessible service like a webserver/database/etc.
If your process isn't that mature yet, it's acceptable to enable ssh, but you should strive towards not needing it.
