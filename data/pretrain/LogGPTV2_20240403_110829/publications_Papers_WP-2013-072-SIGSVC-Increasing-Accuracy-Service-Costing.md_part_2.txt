costs and service costs, the ABC is applicable for service costing. In both cases the activity time
required for the involved business processes is identified and used for cost calculations.
Overhead costs are indirect costs with a weak relation to the costs of a product and are associated
to a company’s overhead departments (marketing or sales). In TDABC, it is easier to maintain
the underlying costing data compared to ABC and a change in a business process requires only
updating the time equation for activity time consumption. In TDABC, time is the leading cost
driver to compute consumed resources (human resources and employees and machines).
CUSTOMER FACTOR CONCEPT
To describe the impact of customers on co-creation we developed the concept of
customer factors. Customer factors can vary per customer and service scenario. Potential
customer factors, which influence the process of co-creation and the associated activities, are the
number of contact persons, the number of production sites or the experience of a customer. A
high number of contact persons and production sites make it difficult for a service provider to
standardize co-creation and to calculate service costs. An experienced customer can make co-
creation more efficient and support scheduling of human resource.
Based on a literature review, we have tried to find which type and how detailed customer
factors are described. In all selected articles we found a detailed, or at least a brief, description
about the correlation between customer involvement and costs. The type of customer factors
range from not precisely specified to concrete values (Bergholtz, Johannesson, & Andersson,
2011), e.g. health care information (Moll, 2010), project complexity, company size, experience
(Sioukas, 1995), commitment, information (Lu & Wei, 2011), co-creation activities (Xiang,
Guo-xing, Jingchang, & Yanqiu, 2008) or knowledge about customer profiles (Furstner &
Anisic, 2010). Based on this input we argue that each customer provides individual customer
factors and it is necessary to consider them for cost accounting. Additionally, it is necessary to
have a concept that allows the comparison between different customers with changing
individuality and also the applicability on different service scenarios (e.g. healthcare, IT,
manufacturing or tourism). To obtain an expressive indicator for customer involvement we
developed a three layered approach composed of customer factors, customer factor classes and
TDABC, (see Figure 1). From activity time, the monetary service costs can be calculated based
on the salaries of the involved employees.
Customer Factors (Layer 1)
To calculate a customer’s contribution we first use customer factors , with i is the
number of different of a service , and map them on customer factor classes CFC (co-
creation, information, technology and experience). For comprehensive cost accounting and to
enable the benchmarking of customers and services, a value indicating a customer’s contribution
must remain comparable, between customers and service scenarios, also when number of
changes. To achieve this, we map the values of first on CFC and from CFC on TDABC. To
calculate , we define metrics based on the service use case and calculate values based on
operational data. If there are no operational data available, then expert interviews can be used as
5
data source. For example the number of contact persons or production sites can be determined
using data from an Enterprise-Resource-Planning (ERP) System. In an ERP-System a company
stores operational data about customers, suppliers, offers, orders and invoices.

Customer Factor Classes (Layer 2)
Based on our literature study and service use cases, we derived four general customer
factor classes. They are always present in a service scenario, are aggregated values based on ,
and indicate the level and quality of provided customer factors. To get comparable values
between customer factor classes, we use a pre-defined range and scale the computed to it. In
Following we describe the customer factor classes and raise questions to explain their semantics
associated to our service use case.
Co-Creation (Co): Describes the level of co-creation. A high co-creation level indicates a
high customer involvement level. The more activities are performed by the customer, the higher
the level of co-creation is. Questions associated with Co are: (1) What is the role of the customer
during co-creation? (2) How active or passive is the customer participating in the process of co-
creation? (3) During which process steps is the customer required? If the customer is motivated
to provide detailed requirements, he can invest more time than agreed which influences resource
consumption on the provider side.
Information (In): For a provider, In measures the degree of dependency on external
information. Questions related to In are: (1) Which information is required and who can provide
it? (2) How high is the level of externalization? (3) How and in which granularity is the
information provided? Questions related to our service use case are: How detailed are
requirements documented and how complex are they?
Technology (Te): Indicates the importance of technology during co-creation. Questions
associated with Te are: (1) Which specific technologies are necessary during service provision
(2) Is a technology replaceable by another one? (3) In which quantity and quality are
technologies necessary? (4) How mature must be a technology? Related questions to our service
scenario are: How many different technologies (internet, telephone, mobile phones, remote
desktop sessions,…) are required during co-creation? Which internet bandwidth is required?
How much time is required to establish a remote session?
Experience (Ex): Indicates the degree of experience and kind of competencies required
for co-creation. The time required for co-creation is influenced by the involved employees.
Consequently, a provider is interested that the customer provides experienced employees.
Including experience supports the provider and customer to find out which levels of experience
6
and competencies are required to reach the agreed activity time consumption. Questions
associated with Ex are: (1) Which level of experience (expert or novice) is at least required
during co-creation? (2) Are special competencies (programming, mathematic or chemical)
necessary to participate in co-creation? (3) Is a special education (medical, legally or civil
engineering) a necessary qualification? Questions related to our service use case are: How
experienced is the customer in requirements analysis? How mature is the current project? Is the
customer a reference customer?
Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) (Layer 3)
The third layer is set for the quantitative measurement. The goal is to measure the impact
of customer involvement on activity time consumption. Co-creation is a process between
provider and customer. This requires analyzing and modeling the activities which are relevant to
compute , i.e. activities which are part of the commitment between provider and customer.
We call them service activities and they: (1a) are required for co-creation; (1b) have a direct
relation to the service offered; and (1c) a provider or a customer is responsible partially or
entirely for them. Service activities provide a suitable fundament for customer factor
calculations, because they are required for co-creation and support customer individual service
scenarios. We exclude for customer factor calculation so called overhead activities. Overhead
activities (2a) are performed independent on both domains, (2b) are not always directly related to
a specific service and (2c) are involved into the processing of different services. To calculate the
activity time for service activities, TDABC is suitable. We selected TDABC because it relies on
time, which is the most important resource for cost accounting in the context of services.
Additionally the calculation process of TDABC facilitates the integration of our customer factor
approach.
Formalizing Customer Factor Calculation
To calculate a customer’s impact for an individual service activity , all four customer
factor classes are required and extended by a weighting factor, see (1). We use the variables Iw,
Tw and Ew to weight the impact of the CFC. This enables to change the importance of a CFC for
different business scenarios. Co-creation is excluded from the weighting, because the level of co-
creation and its impact is fixed by the agreed service activities between service provider and
service customer. A Service-Level-Agreement (SLA) contract can be used to document for
which service activities the customer is responsible. Service activities which are included into
cost calculations have a  =1. The level of co-creation for a service  is the ratio between the
number of  which are part of  and  performed by the customer. Only Ai where  =1 can
result in  >0. Consequently, we use no additional service factors to calculate co-creation and
weight the impact.

The values of , and are calculated for each co-creation CC , at time period
t, from which we obtain CF . This allows a comparison between forecasted and actual weighing
and to re-adjust it. To obtain values for , and , we first identify and calculate
customer factors. To map a to a CFC we use an injective function : →. This means
each can only be mapped to one CFC. Each is scaled e.g. to ∈ [0;10] ∈ and on
each CFC a different number of customer factors can be mapped. The usage of a scaling
7
value different from 10 is also possible. The output for Si is a parameter indicating the quality of
customer involvement during co-creation, which is subsequently integrated into TDABC. The
formula in (2) shows how. We have merged our customer factor approach with TDABC, where
m is the number of different service activities A . is the cost driver and the activity
time for activity . A is something that drives the required time of an activity. For our
service use case a cost driver is the number of different requirements.
