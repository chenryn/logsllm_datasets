ABSTRACT
Multi-receiver Identity-Based Key Encapsulation Mecha-
nism (mIB-KEM) allows a sender to distribute messages for
a set of receivers using the receiver’s identity as a public key.
Recently, Chatterjee and Sarkar [12] suggested a new mIB-
KEM which has sublinear-size ciphertexts and private keys
simultaneously. They demonstrated that their scheme is se-
cure against chosen plaintext (or ciphertext) attacks without
random oracles. In this paper, we show that their scheme is
not secure in that a revoked user can easily decrypt cipher-
texts. We next propose a new mIB-KEM which overcomes
the security ﬂaw identiﬁed in the construction of Chatterjee
and Sarkar.

INTRODUCTION
To distribute a message to some set S of users, the trivial
method is to encrypt the message using each user’s public
key. As expected, ciphertext size in this setting increases
linearly with |S|. This results in too much ciphertext size
when S becomes a large set of receivers. Thus, this method
is less attractive, except for the case where S is small. An

alternative method is to encrypt a message encryption key
which is used to encrypt the message under a symmetric
key cipher. This is called a hybrid (KEM-DEM) encryption
paradigm. This is eﬃcient, in particular, for such applica-
tions as the sender wants to broadcast a same message. In
this paper, we mainly focus on the hybrid paradigm.
In an identity-based setting [19], a sender is able to dis-
tribute a message for a set S of receivers using the receiver’s
identity as a public key. As usual, a Key Generation Center
(KGC) issues a private key for a user identity, and public
parameters for the identity-based system are shared with
all users. Regarding the KEM-DEM encryption in multi-
receiver setting, we can easily consider a trivial solution
by concatenating ciphertexts for all receivers. One may at-
tempt to do this with the previous Identity-Based Encryp-
tion (IBE) schemes [6, 13, 4, 5, 20, 16], where the Hierar-
chical IBE (HIBE) schemes [4, 5] are considered as 1-level
IBE schemes. However, the IBE schemes [4, 5, 16] are not
suitable for the simple solution.
1g−s·ID1 , . . . , gs
For example, consider the Gentry IBE scheme [16] for
a multi-receiver Identity-Based Key Encapsulation Mecha-
nism (mIB-KEM). Assume a sender intends to broadcast a
message to a set S = {ID1, . . . , IDk}. With elements g, h,
and g1 in the public parameters, ciphertext for the set S will
1g−s·IDk , e(g, g)s) for same
be of the form (gs
randomness s, and then the message encryption key cor-
responding to this ciphertext will become e(g, h)−s. Since
information about S is broadcast together with the cipher-
text, a revoked user with identity ID(cid:48) (i.e., outside of S) can
1g−s·IDk )1/(ID1−IDk) and obtain
compute g−s as (gs
gs
1. Thus, he can reconstruct gs
and decrypt the ci-
phertext successfully. This observation can be applied to
other mIB-KEMs based on the IBE schemes [4, 5] in the
similar manner.
1g−s·ID1 /gs
1g−s·ID(cid:48)
In this paper we show that a mIB-KEM suggested by
Chatterjee and Sarkar [12] is not secure. We will show how a
revoked user can easily decrypt ciphertext in [12]. Our secu-
rity analysis is similar to that mentioned immediately above.
Next, we suggest an improvement that overcomes the secu-
rity ﬂaw identiﬁed in [12]. In our construction, we partition
an identity space into subsets using two publicly computable
surjective functions, and we add to public parameters ran-
dom elements which are representative of the subsets. These
random values play the role of preventing such an attack
above from occurring. The proposed mIB-KEM is secure
against chosen plaintext attacks in the selective-ID model,
and is extended to achieve chosen ciphertext security by us-
ing a hash-based method [9]. With appropriate parametriza-
tion, our scheme could have sublinear-size ciphertexts and
private keys. We prove the security of our scheme without
random oracles under the decision Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman
Exponent (BDHE) assumption, which was already used to
prove security in [5, 7].
Related Works. Since the ﬁrst practical constructions of
the IBE primitives [13, 6] appeared, many research has been
done to create secure mIB-KEMs [14, 2, 3, 11, 12, 1, 18].
Until now, all of the proposed mIB-KEMs made use of ef-
ﬁciently computable bilinear maps (i.e., pairing) on elliptic
curve.
The ﬁrst mIB-KEM [14] was suggested by Du et al. [14],
based on the Boneh-Franklin IBE scheme [6]. Their con-
struction obtained O(|S|) ciphertexts and O(1) private keys
for a receiver set S, but formal security proof was not pro-
vided. Later, the mIB-KEMs [2, 3] were suggested with for-
mal security proofs using random oracle heuristics. These
schemes also achieved O(|S|) ciphertexts and O(1) private
keys. Recently, Sakai and Furukawa [18] proposed a new
mIB-KEM which uses a exponent inversion paradigm. At
ﬁrst sight, their construction appears to achieve O(1) cipher-
texts and O(1) private keys, but the decryption algorithm
requires |S| elements in the public parameters.
It means
that sender needs to transmit the |S| elements for decryp-
tion together with ciphertext, or each user requires to store
all the elements in the public parameters (although the el-
ements could be stored in any public device). This leads
their scheme [18] to obtain O(|S|) ciphertexts or O(n) pri-
vate keys, where n is the total number of users.
To suggest a secure mIB-KEM without random oracles,
the constructions [11, 12, 1] employed the structure of key
delegation in HIBE schemes [20, 4, 5]. In [11], Chatterjee et
al. presented a mIB-KEM that has O(|S|) ciphertexts and
O(1) private keys, with the security proof in the selective-ID
security model. Later, Chatterjee and Sarkar [12] proposed
a mIB-KEM (secure in the selective-ID model) that uses a
publicly computable surjective function to reduce an iden-
tity space to a set {1, . . . , N}. The authors demonstrated
that their scheme [12] could obtain sublinear-size cipher-
texts and private keys at the same time (unfortunately, this
scheme has a security ﬂaw although it achieves good per-
formance). Same authors [12] presented another mIB-KEM
secure in the full model, but the security reduction has suf-
fered from an exponential security degradation. Recently,
Abdalla et at. [1] examined a diﬀerent variant of delegation
structures in HIBE schemes [17, 5] and used the variant
to introduce so-called “wicked IBE” which yields an mIB-
KEM. However, the resulting instantiations of mIB-KEM
do not provide sublinear-size ciphertexts and private keys,
simultaneously.
2. PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Multi-receiver Identity-Based Key Encap-
sulation Mechanism
We describe the deﬁnition of multi-receiver Identity-Based
Key Encapsulation Mechanism (mIB-KEM) [12] as below.
Setup(1k, n) takes as input a security parameter 1k and the
number of total users n. and outputs the public parameters
PP and the master key MK.
KeyGen(ID, MK, PP) takes an identity ID ∈ ID, the master
key MK, and the public parameters PP as input. It outputs
a private key dID for ID.
Encapsulate(S, PP) takes a set S of identities and the pub-
lic parameters PP as input, and outputs a pair (Hdr, K)
where Hdr is the header and K ∈ K is a message encryption
key, often called the broadcast ciphertext.
Let M be a message to be broadcast to the set S and let
CM be the encryption of M under the symmetric key K. A
broadcast massage is (S, Hdr, CM ), where the pair (S, Hdr)
is often called the full header and CM is often called the
broadcast body.
Decapsulate(dID, S, Hdr, PP) takes as input the private key
dID for ID, a receiver set S, a header Hdr, and the public
parameters PP. If ID ∈ S, the algorithm outputs the message
encryption key K ∈ K, which is used to decrypt CM and
obtain the message M .
For correctness, we require that for a receiver set S and ID ∈
S, if (PP, MK) R← Setup(1k, n), dID ← KeyGen(ID, MK, PP),
and (Hdr, K) R← Encapsulate(S, PP), then we have that
Decapsulate(dID, S, Hdr, PP) = K.
Next, to describe the chosen ciphertext security for mIB-
KEM, we deﬁne the following game between an attacker A
and a challenger C as in [12]. Both A and C are provided
with n, the total number of users, as input.
Init: A outputs a set S∗ of identities that it intends to
attack.
Setup: C runs Setup(1k, n) to obtain the public parameters
PP and the master key MK. It gives A the public parameters
PP.
Phase 1: A adaptively issues queries q1, . . . , qm where each
is one of
1. Private key query on ID where ID /∈ S∗. C runs algo-
rithm KeyGen(ID, MK, PP) to obtain a private key dID.
It returns dID to A.
2. Decryption query on (ID, S, Hdr) where S ⊆ S∗ and
ID ∈ S. C responds with Decapsulate(dID, S, Hdr, PP).
Challenge: C runs algorithm Encapsulate(S∗, PP) to ob-
tain (Hdr∗, K) where K ∈ K. Next, the challenger picks a
random b ∈ {0, 1}. If b = 1, it sets K∗ = K. Otherwise, it
sets K∗ to a random string of length equal to |K|. C gives
a challenge ciphertext (Hdr∗, K∗) to A.
Phase 2: A adaptively issues private key and decryption
queries qm+1, . . . , qq where each one is:
1. Private key query on ID where ID /∈ S∗. C responds as
in phase 1.
2. Decryption query on (ID, S, Hdr) where S ⊆ S∗ and
ID ∈ S. The other restriction is that Hdr (cid:54)= Hdr∗. C
responds as in phase 1.
Guess: A outputs a guess b(cid:48) ∈ {0, 1}. A wins if b(cid:48) = b.
This game above models an attack where all users not in
the set S∗ collude to try and expose a broadcast message
intended only for users in S∗. The attacker in this model
is static as in [7]. That is, it chooses S∗ and obtains the
374
keys for identities outside of S∗, before it sees the public
parameters PP. For short, we call this ‘sID security model’.
The advantage of A in breaking a mIB-KEM is deﬁned as
AdvmIB-KEM
A,n
= |Pr[b = b
(cid:48)
] − 1/2|
where n is given to both the C and A as input.
DEFINITION 1. A mIB-KEM is said to be (t, , n, qID, qD)-
CCA-secure in the sID security model if for all t-time attack-
ers A who make qID private key queries and qD decryption
queries, we have that AdvmIB-KEM
< .
A,n
The game above can be used to deﬁne chosen plaintext
security for a mIB-KEM if the attacker is not permitted
to issue decryption queries. We say that a mIB-KEM is
(t, , n, qID)-CPA-secure in the sID security model if it is
(t, , n, qID, 0)-CCA-secure.
2.2 Bilinear Pairing and Complexity Assump-
tion
We brieﬂy summarize the bilinear pairings and deﬁne the
(b + 1)-Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman Exponent (BDHE) assump-
tion.
Bilinear Pairing: We follow the notation in [6, 4]. Let G
and GT be two (multiplicative) cyclic groups of prime order
p. We assume that g is a generator of G. Let e : G×G → GT
be a function that has the following properties: 1) Bilinear:
for all u, v ∈ G and a, b ∈ Z, we have e(ua, vb) = e(u, v)ab.
2) Non-degenerate: e(g, g) (cid:54)= 1. 3) Computable: there is an
eﬃcient algorithm to compute the map e.
Then, we say that G is a bilinear group and the map e is
a bilinear pairing in G. Note that e(, ) is symmetric since
e(ga, gb) = e(g, g)ab = e(gb, ga).
, gαb+2
, . . . , gα2b
Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman Exponent Assumption: The
(b + 1)-BDHE problem in G is deﬁned as follows: given
) ∈ G2b+2
a (2b + 2)-tuple (z, g, gα, . . . , gαb
as input, compute e(z, g)αb+1 ∈ GT . An algorithm A has
advantage  in solving (b + 1)-BDHE in G if
] ≥ 
Pr[A(z, g, gα, . . . , gαb
where the probability is over the random choice of α in Zp,
the random choice of z ∈ G, and the random bits of A.
Let gi = g(αi) and let −→g α,b = (g1, . . . , gb, gb+2, . . . , g2b).
Similarly, we say that an algorithm B that outputs b ∈ {0, 1}
has advantage  in solving the decision (b + 1)-BDHE prob-
lem in G if
) = e(z, g)αb+1
, . . . , gα2b
, gαb+2
|Pr[B(z, g,−→g α,b, e(z, gb+1)) = 0]−
Pr[B(z, g,−→g α,b, T ) = 0]| ≥ 
where the probability is over the random choice of α in Zp,
the random choice of z ∈ G, the random choice of T ∈ GT ,
and the random bits of B.
DEFINITION 2. We say that the (decision) (t, , b + 1)-
BDHE assumption holds in G if no t-time algorithm has
advantage at least  in solving the (decision) (b + 1)-BDHE
problem in G.

JEE AND SARKAR’S MIB-KEM

Sarkar [12], and analyze the security ﬂaws in their scheme.
