##### Detailed description
Compilation of core module fails when specifying WITH_TBB=ON CMake option.

    compilation terminated.
The error seems unrelated to TBB, but it doesn't appear without WITH_TBB=ON.
Probably a bug in CMake files?
##### Steps to reproduce
    cmake ../opencv \
        -DWITH_TBB=ON \
        -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES="/usr/lib/liblapack.so;/usr/lib/libblas.so;/usr/lib/libcblas.so" \
        -DLAPACK_CBLAS_H="/usr/include/cblas.h" \
        -DLAPACK_LAPACKE_H="/usr/include/lapacke.h"
    make -j $(nproc)
