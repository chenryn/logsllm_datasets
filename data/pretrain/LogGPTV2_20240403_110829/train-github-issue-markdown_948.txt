After updating `lodash.TypeScript.DefinitelyTyped` from NuGet to version 2.3.3, I noticed that there are two `.d.ts` files in the `typings/lodash` folder: `lodash-3.10.d.ts` and `lodash.d.ts`. Upon building the project, I encountered approximately 80 errors, all of which indicate "Duplicate Identifier."

To resolve this issue, you can take the following steps:

1. **Remove Redundant Typings**: Ensure that only one of the `lodash` type definition files is present in the `typings/lodash` folder. You can remove the older or unnecessary file, such as `lodash-3.10.d.ts`.

2. **Update References**: Verify that your TypeScript configuration (e.g., `tsconfig.json`) correctly references the remaining `lodash` type definition file.

3. **Clean and Rebuild**: After making these changes, clean and rebuild your project to ensure that the build process picks up the updated configuration.

By following these steps, you should be able to eliminate the "Duplicate Identifier" errors and successfully build your project.
