nets, X.Y.Z.0/25 and X.Y.Z.128/25 only contain the
addresses within each group. If the second group were
, we would not consider this
/24 to be heterogeneous because the groups would be
disjoint but not aligned. /24 blocks that satisfy this
criteria are very likely to be heterogeneous. We veriﬁed
that homogeneous /24 blocks meet the criteria at the
probability of less than 0.1%. Based on this criteria, we
found 17,387 heterogeneous /24 blocks (in other words,
the other 198,292 - 17,387 /24 blocks were either inclu-
sive or disjoint but not aligned). These blocks consist
of homogeneous sub-blocks. Table 2 shows the distribu-
tion of sub-block compositions. More than half of the
/24s are composed of two homogeneous /25 blocks. One
/25 along with two /26s and four /26s are also common
compositions. /27 and /28 are also present although
they are not as common as /25 and /26.
Given that at least 90% of the /24s are homogeneous,
it could be considered unusual to split /24s into smaller
sub-blocks and treat them diﬀerently. In order to dis-
cover who is splitting /24 blocks and why, we obtain
AS numbers, organization names and geolocations of
all the heterogeneous /24s using the Maxmind GeoLite
database [15]. We then group the /24 blocks by the ASN
they belong to. Table 3 shows the top 10 ASes with the
most number of heterogeneous /24 blocks, along with
organization names, countries the /24s have been allo-
cated to, and the types of organizations we ﬁgured out
from their websites. The top 2 ASes, which are both
from Korea, include about 60% of the heterogeneous
/24s. Other countries also tend to have more than one
AS. France, Denmark and Georgia each have two. The
US has one AS of which organization type is a hosting
company; the rest are under the control of broadband
ISPs.
To further analyze heterogeneous /24 blocks, we make

Table 4: WHOIS responses from KRNIC for a /24
WHOIS queries to KRNIC [16], which is a Korean na-
tional Internet registry maintaining speciﬁc information
about the addresses allocated to Korea. We focus on
the top AS, Korea Telecom, because it keeps assign-
ment information current. We made a query for each of
the heterogeneous /24s and could verify that they are
actually being split into sub-blocks. Table 4 shows an
example. The /24 block 220.83.88.0/24 is divided into
220.83.88.0/25, 220.83.88.128/26 and 220.83.88.192/26,
each of which is allocated to diﬀerent customers lo-
cated at diﬀerent addresses. Although Korea has more
than 100 million IPv4 addresses [17], considering that
nearly all the heterogeneous blocks including the exam-
ple block have been registered in 2015 or later, IPv4
address depletion might be a reason for splitting the
/24 blocks.
5 AGGREGATING IDENTICAL /24S
A natural extension of the measurement of the homo-
geneity of /24s is to ﬁnd homogeneous sub-blocks within
heterogeneous /24s and to ﬁnd larger homogeneous blocks
than /24s (by aggregating them) if they are homoge-
neous. In this section, we focus on the aggregation of
homogeneous /24 blocks.
We associate each homogeneous /24 with the set of
last-hop routers of the addresses within the /24. The
set can be a singleton if all the addresses within a /24
have a single common last-hop router, but can instead
include multiple last-hop routers if the addresses have
diﬀerent last-hop routers due to load-balancing. An ob-
vious approach to aggregation would be to merge /24s

The Cluster Size
Figure 5: The size distribution of aggregated homoge-
neous blocks in terms of /24 blocks they contain
having the identical9 sets of last-hop routers.
In this
section, we present the aggregation results made using
this straightforward method. (In the next section, we
consider /24 blocks that have overlapping but not iden-
tical sets, which may or may not be homogeneous.)
One may consider to apply the basic idea of Hobbit
(Section 2.3) to larger blocks than /24, rather than to
aggregate identical /24s. However, given the sets of
last-hop routers, it is more obvious to aggregate /24s
having the identical sets than checking hierarchy.
5.1 How large are the aggregated blocks?
By aggregating homogeneous blocks that have iden-
tical sets of last-hop routers, the total number of homo-
geneous blocks has been reduced from 1.77M to 0.53M
(including not aggregated homogeneous /24s). Figure 5
depicts the distribution of size; that is, the number
of /24s within the aggregated blocks. About 0.39M
blocks have the size of 1, which indicates that they have
not been aggregated. Still, many blocks have the size
greater than 1. Although the number of blocks with
the size x decreases as x increases, 21,513 blocks con-
sist of at least 16 /24s, and 2,430 blocks contain at

equal and every last-hop router in one set is also in the
other set.
least 64 /24s. There are even blocks that include more
than 1024 /24s. This result demonstrates that, even
though /24 blocks are mostly homogeneous, they are
not necessarily the largest homogeneous block. There-
fore, using /24s could be ineﬃcient. For example, since
traceroutes towards homogeneous addresses are likely to
be the same, selecting destinations for topology discov-
ery from each /24 might be less eﬃcient than choosing
the destinations from the homogeneous blocks we have
identiﬁed.
5.2 Who are the biggest homogeneous
blocks?
In the presence of IPv4 address exhaustion, assigning
a large number of addresses to the machines located at
the topologically same location may seem unexpected.
To understand why it happens, we characterize top 15
largest homogeneous blocks. We identify their ASNs,
organization names and geolocations using the Max-
mind GeoLite databases, and the types of organizations
from their websites. Table 5 summarizes the identiﬁca-
tion results. With respect to their types, “Hosting” in-
dicates a hosting company. We add the suﬃx “/Cloud”
to “Hosting” if the website describes their hosting ser-
vices as cloud computing services. Although Amazon
is well-known for electronic commerce, we classify it as
“Hosting/Cloud” because the reverse DNS names of the
addresses within the corresponding blocks begin with
“ec2” which is the name of its cloud computing service.
“Broadband” denotes an ISP that provides both mobile
and ﬁxed broadband services. Verizon Wireless (also
known as Cellco Partnership) and Cox are classiﬁed as
“Mobile Broadband” and “Fixed Broadband”, respec-
tively, because they provide each of the services only.
7 of the 15 blocks are being used by hosting compa-
nies. It is understandable that hosting companies allo-
cate many addresses to the same region because they
run datacenters for their services. The addresses within
each block might have been assigned to the servers in a

datacenter. Actually, the two blocks of Amazon appear
to be allocated to their datacenters. The reverse DNS
names of the addresses within each block have the com-
mon keyword “ap-northeast-1” and “us-west-1”, respec-
tively, which indicate the endpoints of their datacenters
located in Japan and US west [18].
6 blocks have been classiﬁed as “Broadband”. Since
“Broadband” ISPs provide both mobile and ﬁxed broad-
band services, the addresses within these blocks could
be allocated to cellular networks.
A recent study
on timeouts has observed that, if an initial probe to a
destination experiences a higher delay than subsequent
probes, then the destination is likely a cellular wireless
device [19]. We use this observation to identify whether
the addresses within each block are assigned to cellular
devices. We randomly choose 200 /24s from each block,
and then send 20 ping probes to every active address
within the chosen /24s. For each address, we compute
the diﬀerence between the RTT of the ﬁrst ping and the
maximum RTT of the rest of the pings. If the addresses
within a block tend to have higher ﬁrst RTTs than the
maximum RTTs of the rest (i.e., if the diﬀerences tend
to be positive), then the block is likely being used for
a cellular network. Figure 6 depicts the distributions
of the diﬀerences of the 6 “Broadband” blocks plus the
Verizon wireless block which we add for reference. Tele2
and OCN each have two blocks and the diﬀerences tend
to be high in all the blocks. About 50% of the addresses
within the blocks have the diﬀerences greater than 0.5s
and the diﬀerences of at least 10% of the addresses are
greater than or equal to 1s. Verizon wireless also has
a similar distribution. Therefore, the Tele2 and OCN
blocks as well as the Verizon wireless block are likely
being assigned to cellular networks. SingTel and Soft-
Bank are very diﬀerent from the others. Most of the
diﬀerences are nearly zero, which indicates that they
are not being used for cellular devices.
