User: When tools such as cx_freeze tell you to use a command such as "python setup.py build", where is this command issued? I have tried both the python command line and the Windows command prompt, but neither one worked with inputting that phrase.
Assistant: Here is what :

This goes on the windows command prompt.
You first need to cd to the directory where your setup.py is situated.

For Eg: C:\folder\setup.py
On the command prompt :

C:\
cd folder
python setup.py build

Now, this will call python and pass the file setup.py and asks to build it.
