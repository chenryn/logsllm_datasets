**ATT&CK ID:** T1587.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exploit Development

Adversaries may develop their own exploits to use during targeted attacks. An exploit is a piece of code or technique that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in software or hardware, causing unintended or unanticipated behavior. Instead of relying on publicly available exploits, modifying existing ones, or purchasing them from exploit vendors, adversaries may choose to create their own.

To focus their exploit development efforts, adversaries often gather information about known vulnerabilities. The exploit development process may involve various methods, such as fuzzing and patch analysis, to uncover and exploit new vulnerabilities. Fuzzing involves systematically testing software with malformed or unexpected inputs to identify potential security flaws, while patch analysis examines the differences between patched and unpatched versions of software to identify the specific vulnerabilities that were fixed.

By developing their own exploits, adversaries can tailor their attacks to specific targets and increase the likelihood of successfully compromising systems.
