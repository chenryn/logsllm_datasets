In version 1.2.8 UrlFilenameViewController maps the url "/products/view.html"
to "view" while version 2.0 maps the same url to "products/view".
* * *
**Affects:** 2.0 final
**Issue Links:**
  * #6061 UrlFilenameViewController does not allow for nested view files ( _ **"depends on"**_ )
  * #7674 UrlFilenameViewController incorrectly parses the view name from the path - makes incorrect statement to such in javadoc as well ( _ **"is duplicated by"**_ )
