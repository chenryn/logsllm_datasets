User: Our team needs to build an intranet Wiki system, which tools can we choose? Please compare the evaluation.
Assistant: Common intranet wiki system tools include DokuWiki, MediaWiki, Confluence, etc. 1. DokuWiki DokuWiki is a PHP-based Wiki system, easy to use, supports Markdown syntax, and is suitable for small teams. DokuWiki does not require a database, and is stored in the "file system" mode, which can be easily backed up, migrated and restored, and has high security. 2. MediaWiki MediaWiki is a PHP-based Wiki system developed on the basis of Wikipedia. It has powerful functions and supports web page editing, version control, multi-language, search and plug-ins. MediaWiki needs MySQL database and PHP environment support, and the installation and configuration are relatively complicated. 3. Confluence Confluence is a Java-based Wiki system developed by Atlassian. It has powerful functions and supports multiple rich text editing, document version tracking, rights management, task assignment, and collaborative statistics. Confluence requires Java environment support, and the price of the commercial version is relatively high. According to actual needs and team size, you can choose a suitable intranet Wiki system tool. If the team is small and needs a Wiki system that is simple to install, easy to use, safe and reliable, DokuWiki can be given priority; if more complex Wiki system functions are required, MediaWiki or Confluence can be selected.
