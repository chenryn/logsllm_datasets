User: Your team needs to build a highly available load balancing system with automatic failover. Please provide a solution and explain its advantages and disadvantages respectively.
Assistant: Solution: We can use Nginx as a load balancer, with Keepalived and DNS resolution, to achieve high availability and automatic failover. The working principle is as follows: 1. Install Nginx: Install Nginx software, and configure it as a reverse proxy mode to realize request forwarding and load balancing. 2. Configure Keepalived: Keepalived is a high-availability service proxy software that binds a virtual IP. When a failure occurs, the virtual IP will automatically switch to other normal service nodes. 3. Configure DNS resolution: configure the domain name that needs load balancing in DNS resolution, and resolve it to the virtual IP bound to Keepalived. Advantages: 1. High availability: Keepalived is used to realize real-time monitoring and automatic switching to ensure the continuity and stability of services. 2. High efficiency: Using Nginx as a load balancer can realize efficient request distribution, improve access speed and concurrency performance. 3. Easy to maintain and expand: Use standardized configuration methods to facilitate maintenance and upgrades, and to easily expand new load nodes. Disadvantages: 1. Complex configuration: It is necessary to configure multiple software and services and ensure their correct use, which is prone to errors and instability. 2. Requires a high technical level: It is necessary to be familiar with the configuration and use of multiple software such as Nginx and Keepalived, and a certain technical level is required.
