Use system monitoring tools: mainstream operating systems provide some system monitoring tools, such as Windows performance monitor and Linux top command can monitor CPU usage, disk usage, memory usage, etc. This information can help diagnose hardware problems. 2. Use hardware testing tools: Manufacturers often provide hardware testing tools to detect hardware problems. Use these tools to detect hardware failures and diagnose hardware problems. 3. Use the remote control function: Some servers have remote control functions, such as iDRAC, iLO, etc., through which you can directly monitor various hardware indicators of the server to diagnose hardware problems. 4. Regular maintenance: Regular maintenance of server hardware, maintenance and replacement of hardware can effectively prolong the life of hardware and reduce the possibility of hardware failure. 5. Monitoring and alarming: Configure the server monitoring and alarming system. When hardware problems occur, an alarm can be sent in time, so as to deal with the problem in time. Please note that the above methods do not guarantee that every hardware problem can be checked out, and it is recommended to perform complete hardware diagnosis and maintenance on a regular basis.
