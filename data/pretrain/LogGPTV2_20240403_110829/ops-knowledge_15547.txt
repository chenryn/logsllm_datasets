User: I downloaded and built a new installation of Python on my Ubuntu 12.04 system without realizing that Ubuntu already comes with it installed.
Whatever I did messed things up as one of the modules I need is no longer working. Is there a way to revert back to the original install?
Thx!
Assistant: Just never build anything like this using ./configure && make && make install on systems with package manager. This may (and will) cause unforeseen consequences.
In order to uninstall what you have installed without package manager cd to folder with makefile and perform make uninstall.
If you want to install other version of python alongside with your existing version, find appropriate package and use update-alternatives to choose default one.
