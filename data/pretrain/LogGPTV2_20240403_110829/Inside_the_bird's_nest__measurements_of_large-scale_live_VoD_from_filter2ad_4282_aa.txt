ABSTRACT
The 2008 Beijing Olympics was an interesting event from a
VoD perspective because it involved near real-time video de-
livery at massive scales over multiple days of a high-proﬁle
event. We present some measurement-driven insights into
this event through a unique dataset obtained from Chi-
naCache, the largest CDN in China. The dataset is unique
in three respects. First, it gives a “white-box” view into
user access patterns which would otherwise be impossible.
Second, since the CDN serves diﬀerent content providers, it
allows to compare and contrast the eﬀects of diﬀerent pre-
sentation models on end users. Third, the nature of the con-
tent itself is vastly diﬀerent from traditional VoD systems in
terms of the real-time and event-driven nature, which gives
rise to unique eﬀects. The dataset allows us to investigate
a wide range of interesting issues: (1) how the live nature
of the events causes diﬀerences in access patterns compared
to traditional VoD and User-Generated Content (UGC) sys-
tems, (2) how the presentation models aﬀect user behavior,
and (3) ﬂash-crowd phenomena. Based on these observa-
tions, we discuss implications for future live VoD systems.

INTRODUCTION
The 2008 Beijing Olympics was an unprecedented event
in many ways. We are speciﬁcally interested in this event
from the perspective of Internet Video-on-Demand (VoD)
systems. The Olympics saw a staggering scale of on-demand
streaming never before seen on the Internet. In addition to
the 3800 hours of live coverage, an additional 1200 hours of
commentaries, highlights, and interviews were added, gen-
erating a total of 5000 hours [2] of online video content. In
China alone, more than 80 million Internet users are believed
to have accessed these videos [5].
The coverage spanned a three week long period and con-
sisted of more than thirty thousand video clips triggered by
thousands of real-time events.
It contains a mix of both
live and time-shifted videos and diverse presentation for-
mats: full events, short highlights, interviews, on-line com-
mentaries, social interactions, and advertisements models.
In these respects, the video coverage of the Olympics diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from VoD sites that oﬀer TV episodes (e.g.,
hulu.com, abc.com, msn.com) or User-Generated Content
(UGC) (e.g., YouTube). Given an event of this magnitude
and importance, it is but natural to understand its implica-
tions on Internet VoD systems.
ChinaCache, China’s largest Content Delivery Network
(CDN) delivered most of the videos within China. (Due to
copyright issues, ChinaCache only delivered video content
for users in mainland China and Macau.) We were able
to obtain traces capturing user access patterns during the
entire duration of Olympics from ChinaCache. All the video
sites used streaming delivery to deliver the videos and used
Adobe Flash streaming technology to provide on-demand
streaming. The dataset contains complete information of
user actions: e.g., which videos they watched, when did they
access these videos, their stop/pause/seek actions etc.
ChinaCache provided the back-end video delivery for
three diﬀerent content providers:
1. The oﬃcial Olympic video web-site which was orga-
nized as a video portal (we label this Oﬀ ).
2. The largest social networking site in China serving
more than 530 million registered users (labeled Soc).
Soc also used mechanisms to actively engage online
users (e.g., using instant messaging).
4423. The oﬃcial syndicated video source site used by other
web sites and web portals which provided ﬁve-minute
highlights of the events (labeled Synd ).
The “white-box” and unique nature of the measurements
enables us to address questions that could not be answered
otherwise. Since the measurements were obtained from the
CDN, we can understand characteristics such as the time a
video was ﬁrst accessed and whether there are any hidden
correlations between how diﬀerent videos are accessed. Fur-
ther, since our dataset is restricted to China mainland and
Macau, which have a single time-zone, it allows us to study
temporal eﬀects and analyze events at multiple time granu-
larities without worrying about timezone eﬀects across the
user population. These aspects become especially crucial for
our in-depth understanding of ﬂash-crowd phenomena (Sec-
tion 5). Similarly, since the CDN uses streaming delivery,
it provides us with detailed state information such as when
the user hit play, pause, unpause, seek, and stop; this cannot
be obtained with traditional HTTP delivery. Therefore, we
can get the actual session times, after accounting for pause
times, and thus reason about continuity in user viewing pat-
terns. Finally, since we have three diﬀerent views into how
users obtained the videos, we can understand if the presen-
tation models aﬀected user behavior.
We answer several interesting questions using this dataset.
We broadly classify these questions into one of three high-
level categories:
• How does the live nature of the event impact the VoD
system in terms of ﬁle sizes, ﬁle access popularity and
end-user behavior? How are these diﬀerent from tra-
ditional VoD and UGC websites?
• How do ﬂash crowd like phenomena manifest in the
context of such an event?
• How does the presentation model impact user behavior
characteristics?
We present an in-depth analysis of ﬂash-crowd phenom-
ena [22, 24, 25] observed in our dataset. First, as a conse-
quence of the way a live event was presented in near real-
time as multiple smaller videos and as a result of hidden
semantic relationships across videos, we observe correlated
ﬂash-crowds involving multiple related videos. Second, the
social networking site contributes to ﬂash crowds by actively
prompting users to view certain videos.
In fact, the ﬂash
crowds in the Soc dataset are noticeably larger than the
other two datasets. Third, the ﬂash crowds extend beyond
just recently popular videos of a live event. Since multi-
ple videos are related by content, similar or related videos
generated in the past that are related to the live event also
become popular.
Based on these observations, we derive some key implica-
tions for the design of future live VoD systems:
• Caching: Our analysis of user viewing time indi-
cates that irrespective of the video duration, 80% of
the users only view the ﬁrst 10 minutes of a video.
This means that caching mechanisms can beneﬁt sig-
niﬁcantly by just caching initial segments instead of
entire videos.
• Streaming functionality: Even though our infras-
tructure provided full video streaming functionality
(e.g., allowing users to pause, seek, or rewind), we
observe that majority of the users do not actually
use such functionality, which is similar to the results
in [20]. This suggests that VoD systems can implement
simpler delivery modes (e.g., HTTP delivery) and still
provide high user satisfaction.
• Handling ﬂash crowds: The live VoD ﬂash crowds
we observe present a unique challenge as they can be
unanticipated and often involve related videos includ-
ing some released much earlier than the actual event.
This suggests the need to design caching mechanisms
that have a greater awareness of such relationships.
• Presentation models impact user behavior:
1. The convergence of instance messaging and online
video created unique eﬀects in concentrating user
accesses to fewer videos and also creating larger
and faster ﬂash crowds. As we see an increasing
conﬂuence of social networks, instant messaging,
and online media (e.g., [6]), it becomes increas-
ingly necessary to understand these eﬀects better,
not only from a commercial perspective but also
for better system design.
2. Users appeared to be more tolerant of advertise-
ments embedded at the beginning of videos, when
the videos had a real-time aspect to them, but non
real-time videos with similar advertising had high
attrition rates.
We present these implications with one caveat, however.
The singular nature of the Olympics — high-proﬁle, high-
impact, global audience, live, multi-day etc. — means that
some of these implications may be less applicable to com-
modity Internet VoD systems. By the same token, the singu-
lar nature magniﬁes the relevance of our measurement study
and analysis to other high-impact events of a similar kind
(e.g., World Cup Soccer, Euro 2012, Cricket World Cup)
that are likely to exhibit eﬀects that will not be captured by
understanding commodity VoD systems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes our measurement infrastructure and the access logs
we collect. Section 3 gives a broad summary of the user
access behavior, video ﬁle size distributions, and video access
popularity and compares these with traditional VoD/UGC
sites. Section 4 focuses on user behavior to understand how
it was aﬀected by video durations and streaming features.
Section 5 provides an in-depth understanding of the ﬂash-
crowd behaviors we observed. In Section 6, we study how
the presentation model aﬀects user behavior. We discuss
related work in Section 7 before concluding in Section 8.
2. MEASUREMENT OVERVIEW
2.1 Content Delivery Architecture
Figure 1 shows the VoD system deployed by ChinaCache.
It consists of the data source, CDN nodes equipped with
Adobe Flash Media Server (FMS), and the Operation Sup-
port System (OSS) responsible for load balancing, billing
etc. The FMSes provide streaming delivery instead of tradi-
tional HTTP delivery (i.e., a simple download). This gives
users functions to seek or pause videos.
443Figure 1: Architecture of the VoD system
The FMS can be in either origin mode or edge mode.
In origin mode, the FMS can obtain contents from local
memory and storage, while in edge mode the FMS can re-
quest content from other FMSes. FMSes are organized into
three layers. The top layer is composed of origin mode FMS
servers and storage devices, on which video contents are pe-
riodically synchronized with the data source. For scalability
and server capacity considerations, there is a middle layer
FMS, which runs in edge mode. The edge layer FMSes di-
rectly serve end-users. Each FMS server is a Intel Dual Core
Xeon 1.6GHz CPU with 4GB RAM with a network-attached
storage system for disk I/O. The system uses a hierarchical
caching scheme [4] to retain recently used ﬁles in the lower
layers and less accessed ﬁles in the higher layers.
User requests are dispatched to closest edge layer FMS
using traditional CDN techniques [3].1 The end user sends
a Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) [1] request to the
given edge layer FMS. This edge FMS serves the request if it
has the content locally. Otherwise, the request is forwarded
up the hierarchy of FMSes till it reaches some FMS that can
serve the request.
2.2 Deployment
During the Olympics, the VoD system deployed by Chi-
naCache covered end users all over mainland China and
Macau, as shown in Figure 2. More speciﬁcally, it included
the users belonging to China Telecom and China Netcom,
the two largest commercial ISPs in China, and the Chinese
Education and Research Network (CERNET). For Soc, the
system primarily serves users from Beijing and Shanghai. To
cope with the large number of users, ChinaCache deployed
482 FMS servers in 8 districts (Figure 2). These districts are
partitioned according to their geographic distribution and
link quality. There are 27 top layer FMS servers. Around
1Due to copyright issues, ChinaCache only handled users
from China; international users were redirected elsewhere
due to the access restrictions.

VoD system
them, there are 95 FMS servers in the middle layer and 360
servers in the edge layer, which are scattered in each district.
ChinaCache provisioned enough servers and bandwidth for
the Olympics to face large access volumes (and ﬂash crowds)
and our access logs also conﬁrm that the servers were not
overloaded. Thus, our measurements are representative and
not aﬀected by server load.
2.3 Content Providers
While ChinaCache served as the backend content delivery
platform for multiple websites during this period, we are
speciﬁcally interested in the video requests originating from
