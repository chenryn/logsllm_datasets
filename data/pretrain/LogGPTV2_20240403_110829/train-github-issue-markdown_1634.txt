The following program calls 'fail!()', but still results in an exit code of
zero:
    fn main () {
        os::args();
        fail!();
    }
Here's what it looks like:
    jclements-09740:~/clements/projects/rust-experimenting clements> rustc ./foo.rs && ./foo && echo "done" 
    Running /usr/local/bin/rustc:
    warning: no debug symbols in executable (-arch x86_64)
    rust: task failed at 'explicit failure', ./foo.rs:3
    done
Commenting out the call to "os::args()" produces the expected output:
    jclements-09740:~/clements/projects/rust-experimenting clements> rustc ./foo.rs && ./foo && echo "done"
    Running /usr/local/bin/rustc:
    warning: no debug symbols in executable (-arch x86_64)
    rust: task failed at 'explicit failure', ./foo.rs:3
    rust: domain main @0x7fdd91815e10 root task failed
... note the extra line of output, and the lack of the "done" message,
indicating a nonzero exit code.
