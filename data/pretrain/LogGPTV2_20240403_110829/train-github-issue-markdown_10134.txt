In an extension, I tried to register an event listener for
onDidSaveTextDocument() which would activate the format function, and save the
file afterwards.  
Using the code:
    commands.executeCommands('editor.action.format').then(() => {
     commands.executeCommands('workbench.action.files.save');
    });
The problem is that the file gets saved, then formatted, but not saved
afterwards. Using a timer for a 500ms delay after the format, before the next
save, gives the wanted result.
The function inside of ".then((){ }" should not be called before the file is
actually formatted, unless there is something else I don't understand.
