### Abstract
Many websites leverage third-party identity management services to simplify user access. Given the privacy and security implications for end users, it is crucial to understand how websites choose their third-party identity providers (IDPs) and how this selection impacts the emerging identity management landscape. This paper introduces a novel Selenium-based data collection methodology to identify and capture the identity management relationships between sites and the intrinsic characteristics of the websites involved. We also present the first large-scale characterization of the third-party identity management landscape and the relationships that constitute it. For context, we compare our findings with the more established third-party content provider landscape. Key observations include a strong preference for popular IDP sites, with websites more likely to form identity management relationships with those sharing similar cultural, geographic, and general site focus. These findings have both positive and negative implications, such as increased responsibility on fewer organizations but reduced user control over personal information.

### 1. Introduction
With the growing demand for personalized services, many websites require users to create personal accounts and authenticate themselves before accessing services. To simplify account creation and enhance personalization, numerous sites use third-party identity management services. These services allow a user’s digital identity and some personal information to be shared across multiple sites, but they also introduce reliability, privacy, and security concerns [9, 13].

Third-party identity management providers typically offer simplified authentication through single-sign-on (SSO) services [13]. In a typical SSO scenario, a user’s browser interacts with two additional parties: a relying party (RP) and an identity provider (IDP). For example, Yahoo can allow users to log in using their Facebook or Google accounts, with Facebook providing the authentication service. Formally, two sites have an RP-IDP relationship if a user logs into one site (the RP) using another site (the IDP).

Figure 1 illustrates a more complex scenario where The Huffington Post allows local login and authentication via multiple trusted third-party IDPs, including Facebook and Google. Note that Yahoo can act as both an IDP and an RP, highlighting the nested nature of these relationships.

In this paper, we consider any third-party login collaborations where an RP uses one or more external IDPs. In addition to SSO, third-party identity providers are increasingly used to share and modify information across sites. Our study shows that these services are often implemented using authorization protocols like OAuth2 (e.g., used by Facebook), which allow one site to perform actions on another on behalf of the user.

We present (i) a novel Selenium-based data collection methodology to accurately identify and validate RP-IDP relationships (Section 2), and (ii) a large-scale characterization of the identified RP-IDP relationships, examining how websites select their IDPs (Section 3). Our analysis captures the impact of factors such as relative site popularity, cultural/geographic biases, and intrinsic website characteristics. We compare our results with the third-party content delivery landscape to provide context.

### 2. Methodology

#### 2.1 Data Collection
To identify RP-IDP relationships, we employed a two-step approach. First, we used a logarithmic sampling technique to select a sample set of sites with varying popularities. Second, we developed a Selenium-based crawling tool to accurately identify and validate RP-IDP relationships.

**Popularity-Based Logarithmic Sampling:**
Given the size of the web, identifying all RP-IDP relationships is impractical. We retrieved the Alexa list of the top 1 million most popular websites worldwide on April 17, 2012. Using a power-law distribution, we placed 80,000 points uniformly on a logarithmic range [1, 10^6] and sampled the sites with a popularity rank closest to each point. After removing duplicates, we had a sample set of 35,620 sites.

**Relationship Identification:**
To identify RP-IDP relationships, we built a Selenium-based crawling tool. This tool acts like a human user, interacting with GUI elements, handling pop-ups, and performing other GUI-driven actions. It captures relationships that are non-trivial and not easily identified even manually, making it effective for modern, complex websites.

Our crawler is multi-threaded, explores each site to a depth of two from the starting page, and uses regular-expression-based pattern matching to find elements related to authentication. The tool prioritizes clicking on potential authentication-related elements and continues until a specified per-site timeout value of 25 minutes is reached.

#### 2.2 Statistics and Complementary Datasets
For both the sampled sites and the identified IDPs, we collected statistics and information using the Selenium-based crawler and complementary scripts. The crawl included downloading 1.4 · 10^8 objects (totaling 1.6 TB) and analyzing 2.5 · 10^7 links. Out of the 35,620 sampled websites, 1,865 were classified as RPs. We observed 50 IDPs and 3,329 unique RP-IDP relations. Additional ownership, cultural, and geographic information was obtained for all observed sites.

#### 2.3 Validation
To ensure data accuracy, our Selenium-based tool carefully identifies true RP-IDP relationships and avoids false positives. We validated the tool using semi-manual relationship identification and classification. By combining loose crawling with manual verification, we built a list of relationships involving the top-200 sites.

Out of a total of 69 RPs, 32 IDPs, and 186 relationships, the tool identified 23, 12, and 36, respectively. The tool successfully avoids false positives, with only a few exceptions due to domain name changes and sub-domain matches.

### 3. Characterization Results

#### 3.1 The Big Players
Table 1 summarizes the top-10 globally most popular IDPs, the number of RPs they serve, and the primary protocol used. Notably, some of the most popular sites on the web, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google, are also the most used IDPs. The general OpenID field, allowing users to input any OpenID provider, is used by only 87 sampled sites. OAuth is the dominant protocol, with eight of the top-10 IDPs using it as their primary protocol.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the fraction of RPs served by the most popular IDPs and the IDPs of a certain global popularity, respectively. More than 75% of the RPs are served by 5% of the IDPs, and the majority of these 75% are made up by IDPs with Alexa ranks in the top 100.

#### 3.2 IDP Usage
Figure 4 shows the number of IDPs observed for each sampled site. While the average is highest for the most popular sites, some less popular sites also use a large number of IDPs. Among the nine sampled websites with more than ten IDPs, six are news sites, and all nine use a login widget from gigya.com, providing a selection of IDPs.

Figure 5 breaks down the IDP usage for each popularity segment. RPs with the most popular sites use the most IDPs, and the top-ranked IDPs are the most popular choices for sites in all popularity segments. For all segments, the IDPs that rank in the top-10 contribute more than 75% of the IDP usage.

#### 3.3 Comparison with Content Services
To contextualize our findings, we compare them with the third-party content delivery landscape. In the context of identity management, the entities correspond to third-party IDPs and RPs. In the context of content delivery, we observe that the site-rank of the biggest service providers and service users is relatively evenly distributed among Alexa ranks, with a weaker bias towards more popular sites compared to IDP selection.

### Conclusion
Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the third-party identity management landscape, highlighting the strong preference for popular IDPs and the nested nature of these relationships. These findings have significant implications for privacy, security, and user control, and they underscore the need for further research and regulation in this area.
