with citizen information about a major political event. Internet
use in Iran skyrocketed, as did mobile phone subscriptions. Dur-
ing the first week of the protests approximately 60 percent of all
blog links posted on Twitter were about Iranian politics. Networks
like Twitter have played a great role in attracting people’s attention
to this user- generated content. All of this meant that for the first
time, any individual with access could mine social networks for
intelligence- grade content. Although the protests were ultimately
fruitless, it is prudent to look back and regard the Green Revolution
as a seminal event in the history of open source intelligence and
indeed the pinnacle of second- generation OSINT.
Barely a year after the Green Revolution, revolutions spread
across the Arab world. The combination of public anger, smart-
phones, and social media rocked dictatorships across North Africa
and the Middle East. However, the CIA OSINT Center was unable
to predict the precise evolution of Internet-based social activism in
the Arab world, arguably because government intelligence was con-
sumed with collecting intelligence from the powerful elite.
However, in recent years the United States, United King-
dom, and others clearly have taken notice. According to
Information Processing in Practice 153
Cameron Colquhoun in an article on bellingcat.com, titled “A
Brief History of Open Source Intelligence,” published July 14, 2016
(https://www.b ellingcat.com/resources/articles/2016/07/14/
a- brief-h istory-o f- open-s ource-i ntelligence/), the US military
“destroyed an Islamic State bomb factory a mere 23 hours after a
jihadi posted a selfie revealing the roof structure of the building,
which is perhaps the most powerful example of the military using
OSINT for targeted operations.” In the private sector, you and I
most likely and most often use intelligence for corporations that
require a predatory eye on the information available on them. Ulti-
mately, whether a civilian or otherwise, the realization that OSINT
can make or break operations is a fundamental way of thinking.
Finally, as well as the challenge created by the sheer magnitude
of information available, and the limited computing ability and other
resources we have to parse in real time, government agencies, police
and spies, and OSINT practitioners face the growing trend for users
to livestream content. This presents very real challenges for all of us.
Machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intel-
ligence will eventually transform OSINT into its third generation.
Intel Types
I feel it is prudent to also list in this section the types of intelligence,
or intel, and some subcomponents. Again, you will have to go hunt-
ing for more information on each type to satisfy what information
this book must skip over.
Perhaps lazily, I call it all OSINT, but that is not strictly true.
Here are all the types of intel that are relevant currently and likely
enduring, with broad descriptions:
• Human intelligence (HUMINT) is the collection of informa-
tion from human sources. The collection can be done openly,
such as a police officer interviewing someone, or it may be done
through clandestine or covert means (spying).
• Signals intelligence (SIGINT) refers to electronic transmissions
that can be collected by ships, planes, ground sites, or satellites.
154 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Communications intelligence (COMINT) is a type of SIGINT and
refers to the interception of communications between two parties.
• Imagery intelligence (IMINT) is sometimes also referred to as
photo intelligence (PHOTINT).
• Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) is the analysis and visual
representation of security-r elated activities on the earth. It is
produced through an integration of imagery, imagery intelli-
gence, and geospatial information.
• Open source intelligence (OSINT) refers to a broad array of
information and sources that are generally available, includ-
ing information obtained from the media (newspapers, radio,
television, etc.), professional and academic records (papers,
conferences, professional associations, etc.), and public data
(government reports, demographics, hearings, speeches, etc.).
One advantage of OSINT is its accessibility, although the sheer
amount of available information can make it difficult to know what
is of value.
Alternative Data in OSINT
There are four popular types of alternative data, which can be
defined as data that is drawn from non-t raditional sources. Alterna-
tive data is useful when used in conjunction with traditional data
sources, like those we’ve already talked about throughout this book.
Web Scraping This is the most widely used form of alterna-
tive data, according to research firm Greenwich Associates. Types
of web- scraped data in high demand include job listings and
employee- satisfaction rankings, which can offer clues to a com-
pany’s growth prospects and internal activities.
Satellites and Aerial Surveillance Satellite images can be
used to count cars in parking lots, a potential source of insight
into activity and peak periods. Satellite and other types of aerial
surveillance data are best supplemented with other types of data
able to provide more detailed estimates of actual foot traffic when
it comes to gauging retail sales. Satellites are also used to track
ships, monitor crops, and detect activity in ports and oil fields.
Information Processing in Practice 155
Sentiment Social media feeds, newsfeeds, corporate announce-
ments, and other items are monitored and analyzed for clues to the
sentiment of the company and its employees. Watching who in the
company unfollows ex- employees on their social media gives insight
into how the employee left. This is sometimes very useful information.
Financial Intelligence (FININT) Information about the
financial capabilities of a target is gathered. Detecting financial
transactions is a rich source of information. Even if you find out
about a transaction weeks or months after, if it is big or important
enough, it may not be out of the realm of what is normal for a com-
pany to communicate about, such as services, tax, and refunds.
Tech Intelligence (TECHINT) Intelligence on equipment and
material is gathered to assess the capabilities of the targets.
My last note on alternative data is controversial, only insofar
as there is disagreement on whether or not FTP data is alternative
or not. Either way, it is useful, so I don’t want to get caught up in
the taxonomy. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and search-
ing FTP servers is one of the most underutilized, underrated activi-
ties undertaken by investigators. There are simple Google dorks
that exist that will allow you to perform a search. Most often I use
“inurl:ftp –inurl (http | https) [company name]” without the quota-
tion marks. Another option for searching for FTP servers is Global
File Search (www.globalfilesearch.com).
Signal vs. Noise
The word signal is a representation of the patterns and meaning
that are hiding in data that is transmitted. In electronics, signals
must be separated from noise to be useful. In OSINT, it’s no differ-
ent; the signal is the information you should follow. The noise is the
tidbits of information that will not be useful to you. In the age of big
data, there’s often more noise than ever when investigating a target
and so more challenges in isolating the signals.
With that in mind, how do you go about filtering the signal
from the noise? First of all, there’s no “cheat”; you have to bear
156 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
in mind—a lways— that no stone can go left unturned. The separa-
tion of signal from noise is often used in vetting the myriad sources
available and evaluating them efficiently. There are categories that
should be staples of your searches, like these:
• Data breaches and leaks metadata search
• Search engines
• Social media
• Online communities
• Email addresses
• Usernames
• People search engines
• Telephone numbers
• Online maps
• Code search
• Documents
• Images
• Videos
• Domain names
• IP addresses
• Government and business records
• Geospatial research
Much of this is easily verifiable, which is the first step in know-
ing when to stop. If you come across something that is not verifiable
but that you think matters, you must “add things up,” or infer, as we
talked about earlier. In doing this, information will become more
than the sum total of its parts in cases. You must then try to verify
your inferences, but it’s the quickest route to putting information
into one of our three buckets as is shown in Figure 7.9.
To truly separate signal from noise, there are a few steps you
can take that should become second nature. Stephen Few wrote
a book called Signal: Understanding What Matters in a World of
Noise (Analytics Press, 2015). Few has written more than a couple
of books (some would say he’s written a few books, pun intended)
on harnessing visualization to help in analysis. In Signal, he takes
a broader viewpoint, focusing on the idea of “sensemaking,” which
Information Processing in Practice 157
Figure 7.9 Buckets: Categorizing OSINT Findings
is different from analytical thinking. Sensemaking involves imagi-
nation and a healthy tolerance for taking leaps where there is no
information to support your route. Upon taking these leaps, you
will eventually land at a theory you can then assess and research.
The two types of thinking— sensemaking and analytical—a re nec-
essary for separating signal from noise where some items remain
unverifiable. One will help you navigate a cluttered information
landscape, and the other will stop you getting lost down one track.
It is easy to think of these as lying at opposite ends of a spectrum of
thinking styles, but a blend is often a good way to approach OSINT
inference. I typically start by using an analytical approach and then
move to sensemaking, although the sequence doesn’t matter if the
outcome ends up being the same.
You should keep in mind that everyone great started out as
someone new. It’s imperative that I do not further the false narra-
tive that only people “gifted” with some set of intangible skills will
be good at untangling signal from noise. This is not the case—I am
merely stating that experience helps.
Finally, OSINT relies on search terms plus the information avail-
able. If you don’t change the language to suit your country, state, city,
or demographic, your searches will not be as effective and efficient
158 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
as they could be. I often use I Search From (isearchfrom) if I want
to search Google within a version specified for another country. You
choose the country and language and the tool does the rest of the
leg work for you. This is especially helpful if you have an interna-
tional target. It is also great for news articles from the selected coun-
try that would otherwise be buried in US Google results.
Weaponizing of Information
There is one more question to ask about vulnerabilities: can you
really create a vulnerability where there was none? Good news:
in short, the answer is yes. A vulnerability doesn’t always have to
be identified in the firmest sense of the word. Sometimes we, as
attackers, have to turn information into a weapon to fully form
a vulnerability. We can weaponize information.
Note that the word information here is that of visual and sen-
sory as well as data or typical information (data). The attack surface
is all the ways that an attacker can affect the target. If your target
has not been able to map their surface and defend against it wholly,
there your true value as an EA lies.
As you have seen, OSINT has evolved with speed and power,
and it will not stand still now. Technologies will continue to
expand and ultimately enhance OSINT practices. With billions of
posts, images, streams, records, and data uploaded to the Internet
every day, an abundance of intelligence is available. As previously
described, individually, this data would be of little value, but collec-
tively it can lead to important insights. The open source intelligence
cycle contains four key steps: collection, processing, exploitation,
and production. What you can infer and analyze from data is often
as important as the raw intelligence itself. Social network analysis,
geospatial context, and often metadata to create meaningful intel-
ligence are of the utmost importance. This process will require your
curiosity and persistence if it is to pay off, though, given how cyclical
the process can be. However, the payoff is often high—f or instance,
the intelligence community has been able to use geotagged social
media posts to track down Islamic State fighters; the messaging
itself was secondary.
Information Processing in Practice 159
The information environment can be generally categorized
along both technical and psychosocial dimensions. This is why
cybersecurity’s primary concern with purely technical features—
defenses against denial- of- service attacks, botnets, massive intellec-
tual property thefts, and other breaches that typically take advantage
of security vulnerabilities—i s lacking and precisely why we need
more critical thinking and AMs for defensive measures. The tech-
nical view is too narrow. As an example, the April 2013 Associated
Press Twitter hack was performed with very little technical prow-
ess and a lot of attacker mindset. In this attack, a group hijacked
the news agency’s account, putting out a message that “Two explo-
sions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.” With the
weight of the Associated Press behind it, the message caused a
drop of roughly $136 billion in equity market value over a period of
roughly five minutes. This attack exploited both technical (hijack-
ing the account) and psychosocial (understanding market reaction)
features of the information environment.
Another attack, exploiting purely psychosocial features, took
place in India in September 2013. The incident began when a young
Hindu girl told her family that she had been verbally abused by a
Muslim boy. Her brother and cousin reportedly killed the boy. This
action prompted clashes between Hindu and Muslim communi-
ties. Fanning the flames of violence, a video was posted of a grue-
some act in which two men were shown to be beaten to death. The
video was accompanied by a caption that identified the two men as
Hindu and the mob as Muslim. It took 13,000 Indian troops to put
down the resulting violence. It turned out that though the video did
show two men being beaten to death, it was not the men claimed in
the caption; in fact, the incident had not taken place in India. This
attack required no technical skill whatsoever; it simply required a
psychosocial understanding of the place and time to post to achieve
the desired effect.
With AMs, if something can be used for good, it can be used for
bad, and vice versa. There is nothing good or bad, but your attacker
mindset will make it so. As an attacker, you can weaponize infor-
mation for the good of the objective and, ultimately, for the good
of the target, who can then attempt to de- weaponize it and gain a
160 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
new and helpful perspective for how information is gathered and
can be used.
In any case, what should be clear by now is that information
is the lifeblood of the attack. There is no attack without informa-
tion. Behold the two stages of open source intelligence through
the lens of the organized, ethical attacker: there’s OSINT before the
objective, and there’s OSINT after the objective. There is no sin-
gle playbook for OSINT; most pentesters have their own methods
and preferred tools. Most often, though, OSINT starts with manual
reconnaissance and reading up on the target subjects, including
using nontechnical sources such as an organization’s annual report,
financial filings, and associated news coverage, as well as content
on its websites and YouTube and similar services. How this unfolds
is a mechanism of the second law of AMs, which states that every-
thing you do (and collect) must tie back to the objective.
Tying Back to the Objective
In Chapter 3, “The Attacker Mindset Framework,” I talked about
two categories of development. The first, recon development,
involves looking for information that can bolster your objective. If
the objective is to get to the target’s SOC, you look for information
on what kind of security doors were in the building; search for build-
ing blueprints; meticulously go through social media accounts to
see if there’s ever been a photo posted from within the organization;
and comb through LinkedIn, searching for the people who work for
the organization and for job titles, locations, and schedules.
The second category I talked about was pretext development.
Pretexts are dependent on the obstacles you have to get around
and the type of establishment you are going to. If I were to build
up OSINT to pose as an elevator maintenance person, I’d have to
find information to support the pretext. I would need the elevator
supplier/manufacturer uniform and ID badge, and I would need
to know about offices the maintenance company has. I would also
want to show up with seemingly legitimate paperwork to support
my pretext.
Information Processing in Practice 161
This is all OSINT heavy.
These are two separate avenues of OSINT that eventually con-
verge but ultimately need separate collection and analysis. In both
cases, all information must tie back to the central objective.
We’ve now looked broadly at OSINT, taking into consideration
its roots and evolution. However, honing in on OSINT and its eve-
ryday functions is the start and lifeblood of every operation. Every
campaign and engagement I have been involved in, with every com-
pany from the United States to Australia, has started with OSINT.
