It would be awesome if there is an option for an off-canvas navigation. There
is nothing wrong with the current dropdown style navigation in mobile and I'm
not against it, I just like the off-canvas style more.
Of course this would not be applicable for every website, but same as the
dropdown style either. So it would be good if we can have an option depending
on what kind of website we are working on. In my own opinion, the off-canvas
style is more "mobile" than the dropdown because we can see it more often in
mobile apps.
Here is a very good example:  
http://designmodo.github.io/startup-
demo/framework/samples/sample-04/index.html  
As you can see the links automatically becomes the off-canvas navigation when
in small screen.
Anyone with me?
