  * I tried using the `@types/node` and `@types/react-native` package and had problems.

Both of the modules seem to define `require` and this results in some
compliation trouble:
    ../node_modules/@types/node/index.d.ts(49,13): error TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'global'.
    ../node_modules/@types/node/index.d.ts(73,13): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'require'.
    ../node_modules/@types/react-native/index.d.ts(8541,11): error TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'global'.
    ../node_modules/@types/react-native/index.d.ts(8542,14): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'require'.
Any tips/workarounds?
