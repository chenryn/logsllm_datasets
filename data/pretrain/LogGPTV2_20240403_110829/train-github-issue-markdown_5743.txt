**What happened** :
We are planning to run around 40,000 tasks a day using airflow and some of
them are critical to give quick feedback to developers.
Currently having execution date to uniquely identify tasks does not work for
us since we mainly trigger dags (instead of running them on schedule) we
collide with 1 sec granularity on several occasions. Having a task uuid or
associating dag_run to task_instance table and using this for scheduling and
updating status will help us here.
