## Abstract

Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful cryptocurrency to date, driven by its growing real-world adoption and popularity. However, Bitcoin transactions typically require clients to be online for a certain period to verify transactions, which can be a limitation in scenarios that demand offline and immediate payments (e.g., mobile ticketing, vending machines). Offline Bitcoin payments pose significant security challenges, as the payee cannot verify the received coins without access to the Bitcoin network. Additionally, even online immediate payments are vulnerable to double-spending attacks.

In this paper, we propose the first solution for secure Bitcoin payments in offline settings, enabling immediate and secure transactions. Our approach leverages an offline wallet and introduces several novel security mechanisms to prevent double-spending and verify coin validity in offline environments. These mechanisms provide probabilistic security, ensuring that the attack probability is below a desired threshold. We conduct a comprehensive security and risk analysis and model security parameters for various adversaries. To further mitigate risks, we introduce a mechanism for detecting and revoking misbehaving wallets.

We implemented our solution on Android mobile clients, using a microSD security card for the offline wallet. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of integrating this solution on a widely used platform like Android, allowing offline and online payments to coexist. We also discuss an alternative deployment approach that does not rely on secure hardware but instead uses a deposit system managed by the Bitcoin network.

## 1. Introduction

Electronic payments and mobile banking have seen rapid development, serving millions of customers worldwide. Mobile banking services, especially in developing countries, have enabled financial services for a large unbanked population. Electronic cash has been a research focus since the late 1980s, with cryptographic techniques addressing security and privacy issues such as forgery, double-spending, and anonymity. However, most proposed solutions involve trusted third parties like banks, and none have achieved widespread real-world use.

In contrast, Bitcoin operates without central authorities, making it the most successful cryptocurrency for real-world payments. By 2015, over 100,000 merchants accepted Bitcoin, with support from merchant tools and payment processors likely to increase this number. Bitcoin's success has led to extensive analysis of its security, privacy, and economic aspects. Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) have also been proposed, each with different goals, such as enhanced anonymity, memory-hard puzzles, and useful proof-of-work.

The primary security requirements of digital currency—unforgeability and double-spending prevention—are addressed in Bitcoin through asymmetric cryptography and a distributed time-stamping service based on proof-of-work (PoW). Transactions are not definitive until verified and integrated into the blockchain, requiring online connectivity and time. This makes offline Bitcoin payments challenging, despite their desirability in many real-world scenarios. Immediate payments at point-of-sale (POS) terminals, where items are released before transaction confirmation, are also vulnerable to double-spending attacks.

### Goals and Contributions

We present an extension to the Bitcoin protocol that enables secure offline and immediate payments. Our contributions include:

- **Solution for Immediate and Offline Payments:** We analyze the challenges of offline and immediate Bitcoin payments and propose a solution that allows payments to be instantly accepted without either party being online. The solution uses an offline wallet and incorporates probabilistic security mechanisms to ensure the attack probability is below a desired threshold. We also introduce transaction limits and revocation mechanisms to make attacks unprofitable.
- **Implementation and Evaluation:** We provide a proof-of-concept implementation for Android platforms, using a microSD security card for the offline wallet. We report performance measurements and discuss an alternative deployment option that relies on a Bitcoin-based deposit system, eliminating the need for secure hardware.

Our scheme addresses a critical challenge and enables the use of Bitcoin in developing markets, offering innovative and independent payment solutions.

## 2. Bitcoin Basics

### Involved Parties

The Bitcoin system involves two types of users: regular users (U) and miners (M). Regular users can exchange bitcoins via transactions, while miners verify and include transactions in the public history, called the blockchain (B).

### Blockchain Operation

The blockchain is a sequence of blocks, each referencing the previous block. Creating a new valid block requires solving a cryptographic puzzle, which adjusts in difficulty based on the network's computational power. Once a new block is created, the transactions within it are considered confirmed. The more subsequent blocks appended, the harder it becomes to tamper with the included transactions.

Transactions can be verified at different levels. Full nodes perform a complete verification, while simple payment verification (SPV) clients verify only the transaction syntax and rely on n-transaction confirmations issued by the network.

## 3. Threat Analysis and Challenges

### 3.1 Coin Forgery Attacks

Coin forgery attacks are not a threat for full clients with a local copy of the blockchain, as they can verify all preceding transactions. However, in offline scenarios, detection of forged coins is challenging even for full nodes, as they may lack the necessary part of the blockchain for verification.

To address this, we propose a time-based transaction confirmation verification mechanism. In addition to standard checks, it considers the time window within which the transaction confirmation was generated, providing high confidence in offline settings.
