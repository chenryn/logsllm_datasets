#### Description

The `UsernamePasswordJsonAuthenticationListener` appears to intercept every request, which seems inconsistent with the documentation at [http://symfony.com/doc/master/security/json_login_setup.html](http://symfony.com/doc/master/security/json_login_setup.html). The documentation suggests that this listener supports features such as `check_path`, but I cannot find any implementation of this in the code.

To improve the functionality and align it with the documentation, I propose the following:

1. **Extend from `AbstractAuthenticationListener`:** This would allow for better integration with existing Symfony security mechanisms and potentially support features like `check_path`.

2. **Check `Content-Type` Header:** The listener should verify if the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` before processing the request. This ensures that only JSON requests are handled by this listener, preventing it from intercepting all requests.

By implementing these changes, we can ensure that the `UsernamePasswordJsonAuthenticationListener` behaves as expected and is more consistent with the documentation.
