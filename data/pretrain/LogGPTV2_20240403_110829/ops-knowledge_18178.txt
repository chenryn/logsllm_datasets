User: I have an SGE script to execute some python code, submitted to the queue using qsub. In the python script, I have a few print statements (updating me on the progress of the program). When I run the python script from the command line, the print statements are sent to stdout. For the sge script, I use the -o option to redirect the output to a file. However, it seems that the script will only send these to the file after the python script has completed running. This is annoying because (a) I can no longer see real time updates on the program and (b) if my job does not terminate correctly (for example if my job gets kicked off the queue) none of the updates are printed. How can I make sure that the script is writing to the file each time it I want to print something, as opposed to lumping it all together at the end?
Assistant: This is SGE buffering the output of your process, it happens whether its a python process or any other.
In general you can decrease or disable the buffering in SGE by changing it and recompiling. But its not a great thing to do, all that data is going to be slowly written to disk affecting your overall performance.
