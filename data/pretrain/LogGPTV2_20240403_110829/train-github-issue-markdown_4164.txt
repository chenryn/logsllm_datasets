**Current behavior**  
Reopening #6971. I cannot reopen, so hence I'm making a new ticket.
Binding `routerLink` to null or empty array does not yield exception anymore,
but yields a url to the current route rather than an empty href, which is
surprising (and imo bad).
**Expected behavior**  
I would expect empty `routerLink` (i.e. null/undefined/empty array/array with
only nulls and undefined) to not add an href attribute. It doesn't make sense
to just pick a url (the current) for linking when a url cannot be produced.
