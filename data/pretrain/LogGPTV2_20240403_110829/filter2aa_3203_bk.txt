The Web server is a single-homed computer connected to the 10.0.48.0/24 subnet and uses the IPv4 
address of 10.0.48.12/24, the default gateway of 10.0.48.1, and the DNS server of 10.0.47.91. The 
Web server has the following routes: 
Chapter 10 – TCP/IP End-to-End Delivery

10.0.48.0/24 (directly attached network route) 
0.0.0.0/0 with the next-hop address of 10.0.48.1 
Web Traffic Example 
This example assumes the following: 
The ARP and route caches on all of the components of the network are empty. 
The DNS client resolver cache on the Web client is empty. 
The Web browser on the Web client has not cached the contents of the Web page on the Web server. 
In this example, a user on the Web client runs a Web browser, types the address 
http://web1.example.com/example.htm in the Web browser's Address bar, and presses ENTER. The 
computers on this example intranet send the following set of messages: 
1. The Web client sends a DNS Name Query Request message to the DNS server. 
2. The DNS server sends a DNS Name Query Response message to the Web client. 
3. The Web client sends a TCP Synchronize (SYN) segment to the Web server. 
4. The Web server sends a TCP SYN-Acknowledgement (ACK) segment to the Web client. 
5. The Web client sends a TCP ACK segment to the Web server. 
6. The Web client sends an HTTP Get message to the Web server. 
7. The Web server sends an HTTP Get-Response message to the Web client. 
The following sections describe the end-to-end delivery of each of these messages. 
DNS Name Query Request Message to the DNS Server 
The following process occurs when the Web client sends the DNS Name Query Request message to 
the DNS server: 
1. The Web browser parses the address in the Address bar and uses a Windows Sockets 
getaddrinfo()or gethostbyname()function to attempt to resolve the name web1.example.com to its 
IPv4 address. For this example, the DNS server is only storing a single A record for the name 
web1.example.com. 
2. The Web client constructs a DNS Name Query Request message with the source IPv4 address of 
10.0.13.110 and the destination IPv4 address of 10.0.47.91. 
3. The Web client checks its route cache for an entry for the IPv4 address of 10.0.47.91 and does not 
find a match. 
4. The Web client performs the route determination process to find the closest matching route for the 
destination IPv4 address of 10.0.47.91. The default route (0.0.0.0/0) is the closest matching route. 
The Web client sets the next-hop IPv4 address to 10.0.13.1 and the next-hop interface to the network 
adapter that is attached to the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet. 
5. The Web client updates its route cache with an entry for 10.0.47.91 with the next-hop IPv4 address of 
10.0.13.1 and the next-hop interface of the network adapter that is attached to the 10.0.13.0/24 
subnet.

10.0.13.1, that router adds an entry to its ARP cache for the IPv4 address 10.0.13.110 and the MAC 
address of the Web client's interface on the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet. 
9. Router 1 sends a unicast ARP Reply message to the Web client.

and the next-hop interface to the network adapter that is attached to the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet. 
15. Router 1 updates its route cache with an entry for 10.0.47.91 with the next-hop IPv4 address of

TCP SYN Segment to the Web Server 
Now that the Web server's name has been resolved to an IPv4 address, the Web client must establish 
a TCP connection with the Web server. TCP connections are initiated through a three-way handshake 
consisting of the following: 
A TCP SYN segment that the Web client sends 
A TCP SYN-ACK segment that the Web server sends 
A TCP ACK segment that the Web client sends 
When the Web client sends the TCP SYN segment to the Web server, the following process occurs:

Windows Sockets connect() function to create a TCP connection between the Web client and the
