### Web Server Configuration

The web server is a single-homed computer connected to the 10.0.48.0/24 subnet and uses the IPv4 address 10.0.48.12/24. The default gateway is 10.0.48.1, and the DNS server is 10.0.47.91. The web server has the following routes:
- 10.0.48.0/24 (directly attached network route)
- 0.0.0.0/0 with the next-hop address of 10.0.48.1

### Web Traffic Example

This example assumes the following conditions:
- The ARP and route caches on all network components are empty.
- The DNS client resolver cache on the web client is empty.
- The web browser on the web client has not cached the contents of the web page from the web server.

In this scenario, a user on the web client runs a web browser, types the address `http://web1.example.com/example.htm` in the browser's address bar, and presses ENTER. The following sequence of messages is sent:

1. **DNS Name Query Request:**
   - The web client sends a DNS Name Query Request message to the DNS server.
   - The DNS server responds with a DNS Name Query Response message to the web client.

2. **TCP Three-Way Handshake:**
   - The web client sends a TCP Synchronize (SYN) segment to the web server.
   - The web server responds with a TCP SYN-Acknowledgment (ACK) segment to the web client.
   - The web client sends a TCP ACK segment to the web server.

3. **HTTP Request and Response:**
   - The web client sends an HTTP GET message to the web server.
   - The web server responds with an HTTP GET-Response message to the web client.

### DNS Name Query Request Message

#### Process:
1. The web browser parses the address in the address bar and uses a Windows Sockets function (`getaddrinfo()` or `gethostbyname()`) to resolve the name `web1.example.com` to its IPv4 address. The DNS server stores a single A record for `web1.example.com`.
2. The web client constructs a DNS Name Query Request message with the source IPv4 address of 10.0.13.110 and the destination IPv4 address of 10.0.47.91.
3. The web client checks its route cache for an entry for 10.0.47.91 and does not find a match.
4. The web client performs the route determination process and finds the default route (0.0.0.0/0) as the closest matching route. It sets the next-hop IPv4 address to 10.0.13.1 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet.
5. The web client updates its route cache with an entry for 10.0.47.91, setting the next-hop IPv4 address to 10.0.13.1 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet.
6. The web client checks its ARP cache for an entry with the IPv4 address of 10.0.13.1 and does not find a match.
7. The web client broadcasts an ARP Request message to query all nodes on the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet for the MAC address of the interface assigned the IPv4 address of 10.0.13.1.
8. Router 1 receives the ARP Request message, adds an entry to its ARP cache for the IPv4 address 10.0.13.110 and the MAC address of the web client's interface on the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet, and sends a unicast ARP Reply message to the web client.
9. The web client updates its ARP cache with an entry for the IPv4 address of 10.0.13.1 and the MAC address of Router 1's interface on the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet.
10. The web client sends the unicast DNS Name Query Request message destined for 10.0.47.91 to the MAC address of Router 1's interface on the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet.
11. Router 1 receives the DNS Name Query Request message and performs the route determination process, setting the next-hop address to 10.0.21.2 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet.
12. Router 1 updates its route cache with an entry for 10.0.47.91 and broadcasts an ARP Request message to query all nodes on the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet for the MAC address of the interface assigned the IPv4 address of 10.0.21.2.
13. Router 2 receives the ARP Request message, adds an entry to its ARP cache for the IPv4 address 10.0.21.1 and the MAC address of Router 1's interface on the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet, and sends a unicast ARP Reply message to Router 1.
14. Router 1 updates its ARP cache and forwards the unicast DNS Name Query Request message to Router 2's MAC address on the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet.
15. Router 2 receives the DNS Name Query Request message, performs the route determination process, and sets the next-hop address to 10.0.47.91 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.47.0/24 subnet.
16. Router 2 updates its route cache, broadcasts an ARP Request message, and receives a unicast ARP Reply message from the DNS server.
17. Router 2 forwards the unicast DNS Name Query Request message to the MAC address of the DNS server's interface on the 10.0.47.0/24 subnet.
18. The DNS server receives the packet and passes the DNS Name Query Request message to the DNS Server service, which resolves the name `web1.example.com` to the IPv4 address of 10.0.48.12.

### DNS Name Query Response Message

#### Process:
1. The DNS Server service constructs a DNS Name Query Response message with the source IPv4 address of 10.0.47.91 and the destination IPv4 address of 10.0.13.110.
2. The DNS server checks its route cache, performs the route determination process, and sets the next-hop IPv4 address to 10.0.47.1 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.47.0/24 subnet.
3. The DNS server updates its route cache and sends the unicast DNS Name Query Response message to the MAC address of Router 2's interface on the 10.0.47.0/24 subnet.
4. Router 2 receives the DNS Name Query Response message, performs the route determination process, and sets the next-hop address to 10.0.21.1 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet.
5. Router 2 updates its route cache and forwards the unicast DNS Name Query Response message to Router 1's MAC address on the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet.
6. Router 1 receives the DNS Name Query Response message, performs the route determination process, and sets the next-hop address to 10.0.13.110 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet.
7. Router 1 updates its route cache and forwards the unicast DNS Name Query Response message to the MAC address of the web client's interface on the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet.
8. The web client receives the packet and passes the DNS Name Query Response message to the DNS Client service, which passes the resolved IPv4 address of 10.0.48.12 to Windows Sockets and then to the web browser.

### TCP SYN Segment to the Web Server

#### Process:
1. The web browser, upon obtaining the resolved address of 10.0.48.12 from Windows Sockets, uses a Windows Sockets `connect()` function to create a TCP connection between the web client and the web server.
2. The web client constructs a TCP SYN segment with the source IPv4 address of 10.0.13.110 and the destination IPv4 address of 10.0.48.12.
3. The web client checks its route cache, performs the route determination process, and sets the next-hop IPv4 address to 10.0.13.1 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet.
4. The web client updates its route cache and sends the unicast TCP SYN segment to the MAC address of Router 1's interface on the 10.0.13.0/24 subnet.
5. Router 1 receives the TCP SYN segment, performs the route determination process, and sets the next-hop address to 10.0.21.3 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet.
6. Router 1 updates its route cache, broadcasts an ARP Request message, and receives a unicast ARP Reply message from Router 3.
7. Router 1 forwards the unicast TCP SYN segment to Router 3's MAC address on the 10.0.21.0/24 subnet.
8. Router 3 receives the TCP SYN segment, performs the route determination process, and sets the next-hop address to 10.0.48.12 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.48.0/24 subnet.
9. Router 3 updates its route cache, broadcasts an ARP Request message, and receives a unicast ARP Reply message from the web server.
10. Router 3 forwards the unicast TCP SYN segment to the MAC address of the web server's interface on the 10.0.48.0/24 subnet.
11. The web server receives the TCP SYN segment.

### TCP SYN-ACK Segment to the Web Client

#### Process:
1. The web server constructs a TCP SYN-ACK segment with the source IPv4 address of 10.0.48.12 and the destination IPv4 address of 10.0.13.110.
2. The web server checks its route cache, performs the route determination process, and sets the next-hop IPv4 address to 10.0.48.1 and the next-hop interface to the network adapter attached to the 10.0.48.0/24 subnet.
3. The web server updates its route cache and sends the unicast TCP SYN-ACK segment to the MAC address of Router 3's interface on the 10.0.48.0/24 subnet.
