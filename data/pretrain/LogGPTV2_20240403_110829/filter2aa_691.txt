 A Simple and Effective CNN 
Design purpose 
• 
Input contains marginal(background) information. 
• 
Capture low-level features of the images. 
margin 
(background) 
face area 
A Simple and Effective CNN 
Training 
• 
Dataset from VidTIMIT 
–  67600 fake faces and 66629 real faces 
–  low quality and high quality images 
• 
Cropped faces 
–  with face landmark detector MTCNN 
–  obtain 1.5 scaled bounding box 
• 
Augmented data 
–  horizontal flipping 
–  randomly zooming 
–  shearing transformations
