I haven't found a duplicate issue, only this post

I have a valid use case and like to share it.
I'm building a framework for storytelling based on react. Every single element
is positioned fixed as I've written a custom layout engine and need full
control over everything. My entry level structure looks something like this
`` renders all the actual items (``) of the story (text,
images, videos, etc.). `` renders UI elements that are common to every
story. For example a `` for controling the volume of
audio/video items.
If I'd render the structure as given above, this would be the result
Since everything is positioned fixed, this does not work. The UI layer covers
everything, making it unusable (e.g. can't click on videos). That's why I'm
currently forced to do the following in the `render` method of `Story`
This works but is ugly as I lose separation. I don't want the `Story`
component to have to know about every UI component. Sth. like a virtual
`` component that renders it's children without a wrapper element
would solve the problem as I could return it from the `` component.
I know this is a rare use-case, I'm rather talented at reaching the edge cases
of every framework I touch.
Funny how writing down these things sometimes magically makes your brain do
useful stuff. I found another workaround. I'm using `visiblity:none` on the UI
layer and `visibility:visible` on the UI components. But it's a hack, nothing
more.
