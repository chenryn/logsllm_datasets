My whole progress is gone now. I was at level 290.. Last night i've finished
"diff two arrays" challenge and submit it successfully. then i went to my
profile page. then **i saw a message that I have no mail address connected to
fcc**. i'm sure its there before. but then i've added my email address. and
verified it.
just after that my whole progress is gone. **I think some how there is a issue
with mail section. i think adding a mail address is making a whole new
duplicate account (Quincy said that may be i've accidently make a duplicate
and it may be the issue.). but the problem is my github is also linked to the
account which is reset.**
I mailed the team@freecodecamp. but still no response. so please check this
issue. otherwise people will loose there focus. no doubts this is the best
code camp ever. i'd love to contribute also after i got more experience and
knowledge. thanks...
