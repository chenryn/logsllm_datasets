**Account Issue: Progress Reset on FreeCodeCamp**

My FreeCodeCamp account: <https://www.freecodecamp.com/333yalindre>

I recently encountered an issue where my entire progress, which was at Level 290, has been reset. Hereâ€™s a detailed account of what happened:

1. **Recent Activity:**
   - Last night, I completed and successfully submitted the "Diff Two Arrays" challenge.
   - I then navigated to my profile page.

2. **Email Address Issue:**
   - On my profile page, I saw a message indicating that no email address was connected to my FreeCodeCamp (FCC) account. I am certain that an email address was previously linked.
   - I proceeded to add and verify my email address.

3. **Progress Reset:**
   - Immediately after verifying my email, my entire progress was lost. I suspect there may be an issue with the email section, as adding an email address might have inadvertently created a duplicate account. This is in line with Quincy's suggestion that accidentally creating a duplicate account could be the cause.
   - Additionally, my GitHub account, which was linked to the original account, is now associated with the reset account.

4. **Contact and Next Steps:**
   - I have already reached out to the FreeCodeCamp team via email (team@freecodecamp.org), but I have not yet received a response.
   - I kindly request that this issue be investigated and resolved promptly, as it can be demotivating for users who lose their hard-earned progress.

5. **Additional Information:**
   - I am a strong supporter of FreeCodeCamp and look forward to contributing once I gain more experience and knowledge.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
