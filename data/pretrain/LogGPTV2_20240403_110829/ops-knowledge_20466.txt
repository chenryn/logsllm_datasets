Certainly! Here's a more refined and professional version of the Kusto Query Language (KQL) query to detect attempts to turn off System Restore:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
// Filter for events initiated by rundll32.exe
| where InitiatingProcessFileName =~ 'rundll32.exe'
// Ensure the command line is not empty and does not contain spaces
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine !contains " " and InitiatingProcessCommandLine != ""
// Look for schtasks.exe as the created process
| where FileName =~ 'schtasks.exe'
// Identify commands related to disabling System Restore
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("Change", "SystemRestore", "disable")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Timestamp Filtering**: The `Timestamp` is filtered to include only events from the last 7 days.
2. **Initiating Process**: The query filters for events where the initiating process is `rundll32.exe`.
3. **Command Line Validation**: It ensures that the `InitiatingProcessCommandLine` is not empty and does not contain any spaces, which is a common indicator of suspicious activity.
4. **Created Process**: The query checks if the created process is `schtasks.exe`, which is often used in malicious activities.
5. **Disabling System Restore**: The query looks for command lines that contain keywords related to disabling System Restore, such as "Change", "SystemRestore", and "disable".

This query should help you detect potential attempts to disable System Restore on your systems.
