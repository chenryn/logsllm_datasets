Message from the General Chair 
On  behalf  of  the  organizing  committee,  it  is  my  pleasure  to  welcome  you  to  the  2006 
International  Conference  on Dependable  Systems  and  Networks  (DSN-2006),  the  leading  international  conference 
on  dependable  computing  since  1971,  being  held  this  year  in  the  vibrant  and  historic  city  of  Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, USA. 
Dependability  is  a vital  attribute of  computing  and  communication systems that pervade every aspect of our daily 
lives.  As we are increasingly relying on reliable and secure functioning of these systems and networks, there have 
been  increasing  concerns  about  malicious exploitation of  imperfect  systems  as  well  as  the  traditional  concerns  for 
inadvertent  or  accidental  faults,  errors,  and  failures.    Additionally,  communication  networks  are  increasingly 
intertwined  with  national  infrastructures  such  as  the  electrical  power  grid  giving  rise  to  the  potential  for  more 
disastrous failures.  The focus of this year’s conference is on topics related to the question, “How can we make our 
systems  and  networks  more  dependable,  reliable  and  trustworthy  and  thus  make  our  businesses,  homeland  and 
society more safe and secure?” 
We have put together an excellent program of a keynote talk by a business and technology leader, research papers, 
industry sessions, panels, tutorials, workshops, fast abstracts, and a student forum.  This volume contains the papers 
and  presentations  in  the  DCCS  and  IPDS  tracks.    The  accompanying  Supplemental  volume  contains  the 
presentations from the workshops, the student forum and Fast Abstracts. 
I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the Organizing Committee 
for  their  hard  work  and  volunteerism  without  which,  it  is  needless  to  say,  this  conference  would  have  been 
impossible.  In particular, my special thanks go to (i) two core members of the committee, Sachin Garg and Navjot 
Singh, who went beyond their particular roles to help in organizing this conference since the beginning, (ii) David 
Taylor, Lorenzo Alvisi and Aad van Moorsel who coordinated and put together an excellent technical program, and 
(iii) the DSN Steering Committee Chair, Jay Lala, Vice Chair, Rick Schlichting, and members Jean Arlat, Ravi Iyer, 
Takashi Nanya, Bill Sanders, Neeraj Suri, Kishor Trivedi, Paulo Verissimo and Chuck Weinstock for their guidance. 
I hope you will have a pleasant and productive participation in DSN 2006. 
Chandra Kintala 
General Chair, DSN 2006 
I  sincerely  acknowledge  the  following  industrial  sponsors  for  their  generous  financial  contributions  even  in  this 
tough economic climate.
