Question: An attacker is attempting to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a program to execute a return-to-libc attack. The system on which the program is running employs Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as part of its security measures. Which of the following statements accurately describe why ASLR could make this attack more challenging? (Select all that apply)
"A": "ASLR randomizes the addresses where system libraries are loaded, making it difficult to predict the address of libc functions.",
"B": "ASLR encrypts the contents of the stack, making injected shellcode unreadable to the attacker.",
"C": "ASLR changes the starting address of the heap and stack at each program run, complicating the placement of shellcode.",
"D": "ASLR increases the size of the stack, thereby reducing the chances of a successful buffer overflow."
Answer: AC
