User: I need to use python-rest-client package into my project. I tried several times for installing python-rest-client into my linux python, it never worked. But it works well in Windows python. Would anybody tell me how to install python-rest-client in linux python.
Assistant: avasal, you were right. I did it by  pip install python-rest-client
