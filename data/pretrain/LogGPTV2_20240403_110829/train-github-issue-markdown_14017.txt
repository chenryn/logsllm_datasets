Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the text, with improved clarity and coherence:

I encountered an unexpected behavior in Julia, which occurs both in the REPL and in scripts (even without a startup file).

```julia
julia> 1 * 2
2

julia> a * b = b * a  # This line produces the expected error:
ERROR: error in method definition: function Base.* must be explicitly imported to be extended
Stacktrace:
 [1] top-level scope
   @ none:0
 [2] top-level scope
   @ REPL[2]:1

julia> 1 => 2
1 => 2

julia> a => b = b => a
Error showing value of type UnionAll:
ERROR: SYSTEM (REPL): showing an error caused an error
ERROR: SYSTEM (REPL): caught exception of type StackOverflowError while trying to handle a nested exception; giving up

julia> ┌ Error: Error in the keymap
│   exception =
│    StackOverflowError:
│    Stacktrace:
│     [1] Pair(a::Int64, b::Int64)
│       @ Main ./REPL[4]:1
└ @ REPL.LineEdit ~/Julia/master/usr/share/julia/stdlib/v1.7/REPL/src/LineEdit.jl:2536

julia>
ERROR: fatal: error thrown and no exception handler available.
StackOverflowError()
Pair at ./REPL[4]:1
Pair at ./REPL[4]:1
# repeated many thousands of times... and crash

$ echo $?
1
```

In summary, attempting to define `a * b = b * a` results in an expected error, but defining `a => b = b => a` leads to a `StackOverflowError` and ultimately crashes the Julia session.
