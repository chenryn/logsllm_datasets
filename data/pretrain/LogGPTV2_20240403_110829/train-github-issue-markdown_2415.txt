## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
# Expected Behavior
I would like my scheduled job run at CET time.
# Actual Behavior
I have set the conf as :
    CELERY_TIMEZONE = 'Europe/Paris'
    CELERY_ENABLE_UTC = False
I store my schedule job in mongoDB with celerybeat-mongo and each time a job
run for the first time, the value of last_run_at become a datetime field in
mongo in UTC and my job never run any more at the CET time.  
I have feeling that when getting the data from mongo, the DateTime Fields
which keep the value of last_run_at, there is a problem when comparing the
tzinfo.
When I look at tzinfo from now(), I get _Europe/Paris_ and from the
last_run_at: __  
But I'm not able to find where is the source of the issue, is it from
celerybeat-mongo or from celery ?
