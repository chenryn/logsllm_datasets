User: To ensure high availability of multiple servers, an automatic failover scheme needs to be designed and implemented. Please provide the detailed steps and technical requirements of the program.
Assistant: Implementation steps of the automatic failover scheme: 1. Confirm the requirements: among multiple servers, which applications need to achieve failover and which services are core services; if a server fails, how long does it take to restore to normal state; acceptable Recovery time and recovery method, etc. 2. Select the appropriate automatic failover technology: Common automatic failover technologies include: load balancing, dual-machine hot backup, mirror replication, etc. 3. Configure monitoring mechanism: In order to detect problems in time before failures occur, it is necessary to configure monitoring mechanisms to monitor various indicators of the system, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network traffic, etc., and establish an alarm mechanism to respond to abnormal situations. At the same time, a heartbeat detection mechanism should be configured to realize real-time communication between systems by regularly detecting heartbeat packets, so that faulty machines can be found. 4. Deploy the failover scheme: Deploy the failover scheme according to the actual situation, which can be realized through active-standby switchover or other methods. 5. Test and verify: After the system deployment is completed, test verification is required, for example: stop the working host, test whether the alternation is normal, and whether the data is correct. 6. Operation, maintenance and optimization: During the operation and maintenance process, it is necessary to regularly check the operation of the failover scheme, find and solve faults in time, and optimize and upgrade the failover scheme to improve the reliability and stability of the system. Technical requirements for automatic failover scheme: 1. Line load balancing can effectively realize automatic failover of the system. 2. The heartbeat monitoring mechanism needs to configure a reliable heartbeat channel to ensure effective heartbeat packet transmission. 3. Guarantee data integrity and reliability, and recover data quickly after failover. 4. The failover scheme needs to be tested and verified frequently to ensure the reliability and stability of the failover scheme. 5. During the operation and maintenance process, it is necessary to respond to system abnormalities in a timely manner, and perform fault handling and system optimization according to the actual situation.
