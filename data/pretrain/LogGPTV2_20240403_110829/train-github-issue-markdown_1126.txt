As discussed on the mailing list, adding type information to an array of
tuples actually slows down Julia. This doesn't seem right:
    f = rand(Float64,10^6)
    i = rand(Int,10^6)
    v1 = collect(zip(f,i)) # Vector{(Float64,Int64)}
    v2 = convert(Vector{Any}, v1)
    @time sort(v1);
    @time sort(v2);
gives 23sec for the typed array and 9sec for the untyped array (with Julia
0.4).
