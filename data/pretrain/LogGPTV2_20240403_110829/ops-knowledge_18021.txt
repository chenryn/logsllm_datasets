User:  How to use Git as a code version control tool for team collaborative development?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use Git as a code version control tool for team collaborative development: 1. Create a Git warehouse: Create a shared Git warehouse, you can use GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket and other hosting code platforms, or install a Git server to create and manage Own Git repository. 2. Branching strategy: In the team, it is necessary to determine a code branching strategy, such as generally using Git Flow workflow to manage code, including master branch (master), stable branch (release), function development branch (feature), hotfix branch, etc. . 3. Multi-person collaboration: In multi-person collaboration, it is necessary to assign the responsibilities of team members and follow a unified collaboration process. Each team member needs to use the git clone command to copy the project locally, pull the latest code through Git pull, and create its own development branch locally to realize the development of new functions. 4. Code submission: Team members submit the code to the local development branch, after testing and review, merge it into the stable branch or the main branch. 5. Version control: Git can help teams collaborate to manage and track code versions. When there is an update, modification or submission, Git will record all the modifications and record each submission record, so that everyone can track the evolution of the code. In short, using Git as a code version control tool requires a strict development process and version management strategy, and team members need to be familiar with the basic operations and processes of Git to ensure efficient, stable and safe team collaboration.
