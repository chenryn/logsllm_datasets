Hi guys,
I need to enable HA for controller currently. I decided to use kops app and
kubernetes version 1.4.3.  
Currently I have 3 controllers (each in different AZ), however I need to have
rest of stuff located only in one AZ, ie. zone C.
In this situation leader election marked master from zone B as a leader and
all requested ELB's somehow need to be created in the same zone as elected
master. In this situation, even I have free IP addresses in that subnet (zone
B) it is not useful as all stuff is in different zone.
Is there a possibility to determine which subnet should be taken into
consideration for ELB creation?  
Maybe ELB should be created in the same zone as svc and pods connected to that
service requested?  
Is there any possibility to change manually leader ?
Thanks,  
Adam
