**Current behavior**  
Adding the `index: true` attribute to a route breaks the `path` attribute. By
this i mean that navigating to `localhost/#/` gives me the route which has
`index:true`, but navigating to the path that belongs to that route (e.g.
`/step/1`) errors with: `Cannot match any routes: 'step/1'`
**Expected/desired behavior**  
The path specified should work the same way `/` does.
**Reproduction of the problem**  
Changing:
    { path: '/error', component: ErrorPage },
        { path: '/step/1', component: StartPage },
        { path: '/step/2', component: TwoPage },
        { path: '/step/3', component: ThreePage },
        { path: '/step/4', component: FourPage },
        { path: '/step/5', component: FivePage },
        { path: '/setup', component: SetupPage },
To:
    { path: '/error', component: ErrorPage },
        { path: '/step/1', component: StartPage, index: true },
        { path: '/step/2', component: TwoPage },
        { path: '/step/3', component: ThreePage },
        { path: '/step/4', component: FourPage },
        { path: '/step/5', component: FivePage },
        { path: '/setup', component: SetupPage },
breaks the path  
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
It is not expected behaviour.
