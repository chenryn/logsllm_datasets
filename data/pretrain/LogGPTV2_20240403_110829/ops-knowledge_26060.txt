User: Please provide a database read-write separation configuration scheme that supports high concurrency
Assistant: high-concurrency database read-write separation configuration solution can take the following steps: 1. Load balancing: Use load balancing technology to distribute access requests to multiple servers to eliminate single points of failure. 2. Read-write separation: separate read and write operations to different servers to improve database concurrency performance. 3. Database master-slave replication: establish a replication channel between the master library and the slave library, and synchronize the data copy of the master library to the slave library. 4. Database sharding: Shard the database, divide the data into multiple parts and store them on different database servers, so as to improve the performance and availability of database access. 5. Database caching: Use caching to reduce the pressure on the database, such as using Redis to cache commonly used read data to avoid frequent database queries. 6. Database connection pool: use the connection pool to manage database connections, reduce the overhead of connecting to the database, and improve the concurrency of the system. In the end, we can get a complete high-concurrency database read-write separation configuration solution, the key points of which are load balancing, read-write separation, master-slave replication and the use of fragmentation technology, as well as the reasonable use and management of cache and connection pool.
