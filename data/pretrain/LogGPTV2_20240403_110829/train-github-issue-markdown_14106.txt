## Issue
When upgrading from version 4.1.1 to 5.2.1, I encountered the following error:

```
org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'myTestController': Unsatisfied dependency expressed through method 'setMyTestService' parameter 0; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'myTestServiceImpl': Unsatisfied dependency expressed through method 'setMyTestDao' parameter 0; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'myTestDao' defined in file [/Users/waylon/Project/fjld/test/server/account/target/classes/com/fjld/test/server/account/dao/MyTestDao.class]: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through bean property 'sqlSessionFactory'; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'sqlSessionFactory' defined in class path resource [org/mybatis/spring/boot/autoconfigure/MybatisAutoConfiguration.class]: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through method 'sqlSessionFactory' parameter 0; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'shardingSphereDataSource' defined in class path resource [org/apache/shardingsphere/spring/boot/ShardingSphereAutoConfiguration.class]: Bean instantiation via factory method failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException: Failed to instantiate [javax.sql.DataSource]: Factory method 'shardingSphereDataSource' threw exception; nested exception is org.yaml.snakeyaml.error.YAMLException: Unable to find getter for property 'tenantColumn' on object com.alibaba.druid.wall.WallFilter@60df7989: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException
```

### Summary
The error indicates a chain of unsatisfied dependencies, ultimately leading to an issue with the `shardingSphereDataSource` bean. The root cause appears to be a `YAMLException` related to the `WallFilter` configuration, specifically the inability to find a getter for the `tenantColumn` property.

### Possible Causes and Solutions
1. **Configuration Inconsistency**: Ensure that your `application.yml` or `application.properties` file is correctly configured for the new version. Specifically, check the `WallFilter` configuration and ensure that the `tenantColumn` property is correctly defined.
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: Verify that all dependencies are compatible with the new version. Check for any conflicting versions of libraries, especially those related to MyBatis, ShardingSphere, and Druid.
3. **Code Changes**: Review any code changes made during the upgrade. Ensure that the `MyTestController`, `MyTestServiceImpl`, and `MyTestDao` classes, as well as their respective dependencies, are correctly defined and annotated.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Check Configuration**:
   - Open your `application.yml` or `application.properties` file.
   - Ensure that the `WallFilter` configuration includes the `tenantColumn` property and that it has a corresponding getter and setter.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     druid:
       wall:
         config:
           tenantColumn: your_tenant_column_name
     ```

2. **Update Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all dependencies in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file are up-to-date and compatible with the new version.
   - Example (for Maven):
     ```xml
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.apache.shardingsphere</groupId>
         <artifactId>sharding-jdbc-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
         <version>5.2.1</version>
     </dependency>
     <dependency>
         <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>
         <artifactId>druid-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
         <version>1.2.8</version>
     </dependency>
     ```

3. **Review Code**:
   - Ensure that the `MyTestController`, `MyTestServiceImpl`, and `MyTestDao` classes are correctly defined and annotated.
   - Example:
     ```java
     @Controller
     public class MyTestController {
         @Autowired
         private MyTestService myTestService;

         // ...
     }

     @Service
     public class MyTestServiceImpl implements MyTestService {
         @Autowired
         private MyTestDao myTestDao;

         // ...
     }

     @Repository
     public interface MyTestDao extends JpaRepository<MyTestEntity, Long> {
         // ...
     }
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully upgrade to version 5.2.1. If the problem persists, consider checking the logs for more detailed information and reviewing the official documentation for any additional configuration requirements.
