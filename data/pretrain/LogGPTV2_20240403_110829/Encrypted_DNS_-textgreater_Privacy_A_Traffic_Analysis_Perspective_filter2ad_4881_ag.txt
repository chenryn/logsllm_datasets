C. Estimation of Probabilities
In this section, we explain how we estimated the probabilities
for the entropy analysis in Section VII.
We deﬁne the anonymity set of a trace s as a multiset:
A(s) := {wms(w)},
where ms(w) is the multiplicity of a website w in A(s). The
multiplicity is a function deﬁned as the number of times that
trace s occurrs in w.
The probability Pr[W = w | Sl = o] can be worked out using
Bayes. For instance, for website w,
m
Pr[W = w | Sl = o] =
Pr[W =w] Pr[Sl =o|W =w]
Pr[W = wi] Pr[Sl = o | W = wi]
(1)
i=1
i.e.,
We assume the distribution of priors is uniform,
the
probability of observing a website is the same for all websites:
Pr[wi] = Pr[wj] ∀i, j.
We acknowledge that this is an unrealisitc assumption but we
provide the mathematical model to incorporate the priors in
case future work has the data to estimate them.
Assuming uniform priors simpliﬁes the Bayes rule formula
since we can factor out Pr[W = wi] in Equation 1
Regarding the likelihoods of observing the traces given a
website, we can use the trafﬁc trace samples in our dataset
as observations to estimate them:
Pr[Sl = o | W = wi] ≈ ms(wi)
ki
.
Since we have a large number of samples for all the sites, we
can ﬁx the same sample size for all sites: ki = k j ∀i, j. A
ﬁxed sample size allows us to factor out ki in our likelihood
estimates and, thus, the posterior can be estimated as:
m
Pr[W = w | Sl = o] ≈ ms(w)
ms(wi)
ms(w)
|A(s)| .
=
i=1
That is the multiplicity of website w divided by the size of the
s’s anonymity set, which can be computed efﬁciently for all
w and s using vectorial operations.

D. Extra results on attack robustness
In this section, we provide additional
information on our
experiment measuring the inﬂuence of end user’s platform
(Section V-C3). Figure 12 shows the difference in TLS record
sizes for both platforms – the sizes follow a similar dis-
tribution, with a shift. Table X shows the improvement in
performance we obtain when removing this shift.

platform experiment.

removing the shift (standard deviation less than 1%).

E. Survivors and Easy Preys
In this section, we show results from our analysis of sur-
vivors and easy preys, as discussed in Section V-C. We show
the top-10 webpages with highest-mean and lowest-variance
(Table XI), lowest-mean and lowest-variance (Table XII), and
highest-variance F1-score (Table XIII).
F. Confusion Graphs
We have used confusion graphs to understand the errors
of the classiﬁer. Confusion graphs are the graph represen-
tation of confusion matrices. They allow to easily visualize
large confusion matrices by representing misclassiﬁcations
as directed graphs. Confusion graphs have been used in
website ﬁngerprinting [67] and other classiﬁcation tasks to
understand classiﬁer error [81]. The graphs for our clas-
siﬁer can be found in the extended version of our pa-
per at https://github.com/spring-epﬂ/doh trafﬁc analysis/blob/
master/paper/doh trafﬁc analysis ndss2020.pdf.
