User: I used MailSlots with Delphi for my softwares when I needed dialogs between them (on MS Windows on the same coputer).
Now I need to do the same things but with Python and on MS Windows but also on Linux.
So : what is the best way to communicate between Python written software running on the same computer ?
For some firewall problemes I would prefer to avoid IP dialogs.
As I tested it, I don't want all the DIsk File share solutions. 
So in brief :  


2 Python software on the same computer need to dialog.
No IP
No Disk File share.
Assistant: How about one of them being a thread started by the another one?
