### Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger and Term Extraction
We utilized a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger with the Penn Treebank tagset [20] to extract nouns, which helped reduce the number of noisy words. For each actor, we extracted 4 topics, each containing 7 words, resulting in a total of 28 terms. Table 4 presents the most frequent terms used by key actors, specifically those used by more than five actors.

### Selection of Potential Key Actors
After analyzing the most frequent terms used by key actors, we repeated the topic analysis with a subset of potential key actors identified from our previous analyses. We used logistic regression to predict the probability of each forum user being a key actor. We selected users with a predicted probability of 10% or more (n = 88, named LogReg). From the clustering analysis, we selected 201 users (named Clust) from the cluster with the highest ratio of key actors. Finally, from our social network analysis, we selected 42 actors (named SNA) directly connected with at least three key actors. There were overlaps between these subsets:
- 10 actors appeared in all three subsets.
- 26 actors appeared in both LogReg and Clust but not SNA.
- 7 actors appeared in both SNA and Clust but not LogReg.
- No actors appeared only in both LogReg and SNA.

The final subset of potential key actors included 285 forum users.

### Predicting Key Actors
We applied topic analysis to the potential actors, extracting their 28 most common terms. We then measured the number of common terms with those obtained for the key actors to get a similarity score. This score was calculated as the number of matching terms divided by the total number of terms extracted for the actor. However, similarities could be due to commerce-related or forum-related terms. Therefore, we also looked for particularly interesting terms related to hacking (highlighted in Table 4).

We established a minimum distance of 0.2 (i.e., at least 20% of the terms must match those observed in the key actors) and a minimum of 2 keywords. Using these thresholds, we predicted:
- 22 actors from the LogReg subset,
- 34 actors from the Clust subset,
- 9 actors from the SNA subset,
- 8 actors from the overlap of the LogReg and Clust subsets.

From the 10 actors common in all three subsets, 7 were predicted to be key actors. The closest members to key actors according to their topics were those identified with clustering. However, only 20% of users from this subset were predicted to be key actors, while 42% of the users from the logistic regression subset were predicted to be key actors. Our findings suggest that combining different data science techniques assists in predicting potential key actors.

Overall, from the list of 285 potential key actors, 80 were predicted to be of interest. Our estimation confirmed that these actors have similar activity profiles, interests, and social behaviors as those identified manually. They also talk about similar, hacking-related terms, indicating their involvement or close proximity to cybercrime activities. Monitoring these actors could be of interest to security firms and intelligence agencies. A manual analysis of the forum activity of these actors confirmed that they are providing or asking for illegal assets and services such as malware, booters, or stolen accounts.

**Table 5: Summary of Prediction Using Topic Analysis**
| Subset | Predicted/Total (%) | Avg. Distance | Farthest | Closest |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|----------|---------|
| LogReg | 22/52 (42.31)       | 0.43          | 0.10     | 0.72    |
| Clust  | 34/165 (20.61)      | 0.66          | 0.29     | 0.93    |
| SNA    | 9/25 (36.00)        | 0.57          | 0.36     | 0.75    |
| LogReg & Clust | 8/26 (30.77) | 0.63          | 0.36     | 0.89    |
| SNA & Clust | 0/7 (0.00)       | 0.60          | 0.43     | 0.68    |

### Ethical Considerations
Our research methodology was designed with ethical considerations in mind. The department's research ethics committee approved the project, and we complied with the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre’s data sharing agreements. While the data are publicly available, it could be used by malicious actors to deanonymize users based on their posts. It was impossible to obtain informed consent from users, but this approach is justified as the dataset is collected from the public Internet and is used for research on collective behavior without aiming to identify particular members. Further precautions include not identifying individuals and presenting results objectively.

### Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the results are based on a single forum, so we do not analyze actors operating on other forums or measure off-forum activities. Future work will address cross-forum behavior. Second, our focus on external sources to identify key actors may introduce bias. Additionally, the low proportion of identified key actors hinders the use of reliable classification techniques like supervised machine learning. Third, our definition of the social network relies on public interactions, unlike previous works that used private messages. Recent studies show that public and private relations differ. Finally, evaluating if predicted actors are actually involved in criminal activities is challenging, even with manual analysis. Our research aims to inform crime prevention efforts rather than conduct law enforcement investigations.

### Conclusion
Underground forums are key pillars for the rise of underground economies. The anonymity and ease of access to attack tools make these forums attractive for young, non-skilled individuals to learn about hacking. Analyzing the evolution of these low-level hackers can help in early intervention to deter their involvement in criminal activities. Understanding key actors and the tools they provide is crucial for adapting to new forms of attack.

We conducted a large-scale analysis of key actors from one of the largest English-speaking underground forums. We found evidence of online social connections between these key actors and uncovered various common roles. Some are well-known in the community and actively participate in non-illicit sections, while others focus on market and monetization processes. We also noted an evolution of interests towards more market and hacking-related topics, and a decrease in threads requesting help or asking questions.

We developed tools for detecting and predicting actors involved in cybercrime activities. These tools help identify user accounts that might require further investigation by law enforcement and security firms monitoring underground communities. The tools used during this research are publicly available in our git repository [6].

The purpose of our research is to understand who is at risk of becoming involved in crime, so as to apply early intervention approaches. Preventing young people from becoming involved in cybercrime benefits them later in life, as contact with the criminal justice system can be stigmatizing and affect future job prospects and legitimate opportunities.
