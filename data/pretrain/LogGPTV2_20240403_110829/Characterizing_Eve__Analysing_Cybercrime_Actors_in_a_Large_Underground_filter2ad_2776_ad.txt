of-Speech (POS) tagger using the Penn Treebank tagset [20]. Using common
NLP tools with low-resource language corpora presents limitations. Nevertheless,
for this particular task the application of the POS tagger for extracting nouns
reduces the number of noisy words.
For each actor, we extract 4 topics with 7 words per topic, resulting in 28
terms. Table 4 shows the most frequent terms used by the key actors (we show
those used by more than ﬁve actors). The most common term is ‘rat’ (Remote
Access Trojan) which could be expected given a bulk of key actors were identiﬁed
due to their links with RAT coding. Various terms relate to oﬀensive tools, such
as ‘bot’, ‘booter’, ‘crypter’ and ‘fud’ (‘fully undetectable’). Words related to com-
merce include ‘paypal’, ‘btc’ (Bitcoin), ‘lr’ (Liberty Reserve, a digital currency
provider which was shut down in 2013), ‘free’, and ‘cheap’. Also noteworthy is
the high frequency of the words ‘help’, ‘need’ or ‘question’.

Selection of Potential Key Actors. After analysing the most frequent terms
used by key actors, we repeat the topic analysis with a subset of potential key
actors identiﬁed from our previous analyses. The logistic regression provides
predicted probabilities for each forum user. We obtain a subset (named LogReg)
by selecting those with a predicted probability of 10% or more of being a key
actor (n = 88). From the clustering analysis we select 201 users (named Clust)
from the cluster which contained the highest ratio of key actors (see Table 3).
Finally, from our social network analysis, we select 42 actors (named SNA)
directly connected with at least 3 key actors (see Fig. 1). There are common
actors between subsets: 10 actors appear in the three subsets; 26 appear in the
LogReg and Clust subsets, but not the SNA; and 7 appear in the SNA and Clust
subset, but not the LogReg. There are no overlaps between only the LogReg and
SNA subsets. The ﬁnal subset of potential key actors includes 285 forum users.
Predicting Key Actors. We apply topic analysis to the potential actors,
extracting their 28 most common terms. We then measure the number of com-
mon terms with those obtained for the key actors to get a similarity score.
This score is calculated as the number of terms matching the list of terms from
key actors (Table 4) divided by the total number of terms extracted for the
actor. However, similarities may be due to commerce-related terms (e.g. ‘btc’ or
‘cheap’) or forum-related terms (‘need’, ‘thread’ or ‘help’). Thus, we also look
for particularly interesting terms related with hacking (highlighted in Table 4).
As a prediction threshold, we establish a minimum distance of 0.2 (i.e. at
least a 20% of the terms must match with those observed in the key actors) and
a minimum number of 2 keywords observed.5 Table 5 summarizes our ﬁndings.
Using these thresholds, we predict 22 actors from the LogReg subset, 34 from
the Clust subset and 9 from the SNA subset. We also predict 8 actors from the
overlap of the LogReg and Clust subsets. From the 10 actors that were common
in the three subsets, 7 are predicted to be key actors. The closest members to
key-actors according to their topics are those identiﬁed with clustering. However,
only 20% of users from this subset are predicted to be key actors. Meanwhile,
42% of the users from the logistic regression subset are predicted to be key

and manually inspecting the results.

actors. Our ﬁndings suggest combining diﬀerent data science techniques assists
in the prediction of potential key actors.
Overall, from the list of 285 potential key actors, 80 are predicted to be
of interest. Our estimation conﬁrms (i) these are actors with a similar activity
proﬁle, interest and social behaviour as those identiﬁed manually, and (ii) they
talk about similar, hacking-related terms. Thus, we can conclude that these
actors are either involved or close to involvement in cybercrime activities, and
thus might beneﬁt the most from intervention. Also, monitoring these actors
could be of interest for security ﬁrms and intelligence agencies. A manual analysis
of the forum activity of these actors conﬁrms that they are all providing or asking
for illegal assets and services such as malware, booters or stolen accounts.

6 Ethical Considerations
The research methodology was designed with ethical considerations at the fore-
front. The department’s research ethics committee gave their approval for the
research project. Furthermore, we complied with the Cambridge Cybercrime
Centre’s data sharing agreements. While the data are publicly available (and the
forum users are aware of this), it could be used by malicious actors, for example
to deanonymize users based on their posts. It was impossible for us to obtain
informed consent from users as that would require us to identify them ﬁrst. In
accordance with the British Society of Criminology’s Statement on Ethics, this
approach is justiﬁed as the dataset is collected from the public Internet, and is
used for research on collective behaviour, without aiming to identify particular
members. Further precautions taken include not identifying individuals (includ-
ing not publishing usernames), and presenting results objectively.
7 Limitations
We have presented a longitudinal study of behavioural aspects of key actors in
underground forums. This research has attempted to overcome the signiﬁcant
224
S. Pastrana et al.
diﬃculties in this challenging area of research. However, a number of limitations
remain. First, results are based on the observation of a single forum. Thus, we
do not analyse actors operating on other forums, nor do we measure actors’
activities that occur oﬀ-forum. Future work will analyse cross-forum behaviour.
Second, we focus on external sources to identify key actors, and thus our results
could be biased by feedback from these sources. Moreover, the proportion of
identiﬁed key actors in the forum is low, hindering the use of reliable classiﬁcation
techniques such as supervised machine learning. Third, our deﬁnition of the
social network relies on public interactions. Unlike previous works [11,22], we
do not use private messages to reﬁne social relations. Recent work shows that
public and private relations diﬀer [26]. Finally, evaluating if the predicted actors
are actually involved into criminal activities is not straightforward, even with
manual analysis. Investigations into actors to produce evidence they are involved
in cybercrime is a matter for law enforcement. Instead, our research helps to focus
the spotlight, with the aim of informing crime prevention eﬀorts.
8 Conclusion
Underground forums are one of the key pillars for the rise of underground
economies. The sense of anonymity they provide, together with the ease of access
to attack tools and services make these forums attractive places for young, non-
skilled people to learn about hacking. Analysing the evolution of these low-level
hackers makes it possible to consider early intervention approaches, with the aim
of deterring their involvement away from criminal activities. Additionally, under-
standing who the key actors are, and what new tools they provide, is helpful for
rapidly adapting to new forms of attack. For example, antivirus vendors could
monitor those providing tools aimed at bypassing detection and new variants of
malware.
We have conducted a large scale analysis of key actors from one of the largest
English-speaking underground forums. We have evidence of online social connec-
tions between these key actors, and our research uncovers various common roles
for these key actors. For example, some are well known in the community and
actively participate in non-illicit sections. Others are less active and focus their
activity in the market and monetization processes. Also, we note an evolution of
interests towards more market and hacking related topics, as well as a decrease
in threads requesting help or asking questions.
Finally, we have developed tools for detection and prediction of actors
involved in cybercrime activities. These tools help to identify user accounts that
might require further investigation by law enforcement and security ﬁrms moni-
toring underground communities and also for early deployment of new counter-
measures or adaptation of existing ones. The tools used during this research are
publicly available in our git repository6.
The purpose of our research is not to track and pursue criminal oﬀenders,
but understand who is at risk of becoming involved in crime, so as to apply

intervention approaches at early stages. Identifying those that might be at risk
of becoming involved in crime is critical for early intervention. Preventing young
people from becoming involved in cybercrime will be of beneﬁt for them later in
life, as contact with the criminal justice system can be a stigmatising experience,
aﬀecting later job prospects and legitimate opportunities.
