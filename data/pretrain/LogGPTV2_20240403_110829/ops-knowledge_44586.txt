Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the template extraction:

### Log Line Template:
```
Connection request from old client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>; will be dropped if server is in read-only mode
```

### Explanation:
- `<IP_ADDRESS>`: Placeholder for the IP address (e.g., `10.10.34.16`).
- `<PORT>`: Placeholder for the port number (e.g., `39498`).

This template clearly indicates that any connection request from an old client with a specific IP address and port will be dropped if the server is in read-only mode.
