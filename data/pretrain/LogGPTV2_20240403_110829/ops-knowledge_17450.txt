Install and configure Ansible: Install Ansible on the target host and create an Ansible configuration file on the control host. 2. Write an Ansible playbook: Write a playbook in yaml format on the control host to define the tasks and configurations that need to be performed on the target host. 3. Create Ansible inventory: Create an inventory file on the control host to define the hosts to be managed and their attributes. 4. Run Ansible playbook: run Ansible playbook, connect to the target host and automate configuration tasks. 5. Verify configuration results: Check that the target host's configuration is updated as expected and that required packages and services are correctly configured.
