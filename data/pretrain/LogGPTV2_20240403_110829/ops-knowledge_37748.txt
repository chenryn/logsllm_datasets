I have installed Python 2.6 from the source code, and later, by mistake, I also installed another instance of Python 2.6 using a package manager.

Now, I am unable to find a way to uninstall the Python version that was built from the source. Is it possible or straightforward to do this?

I am currently running Ubuntu 10.04.

Assistant: In the future, it may be prudent to use `sudo checkinstall` when building software from source. This tool creates a package that can be easily managed by the package manager, making it simpler to uninstall later if needed.
