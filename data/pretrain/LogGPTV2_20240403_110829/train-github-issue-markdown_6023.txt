Observe lack of focus ring on some FF screenshots
**Describe the bug**
Hello there ðŸ‘‹ . We're building an in-house visual regression tool using
playwright which has been a huge help for us. I've recently come across an
edge case on Firefox and sometimes Webkit.
When running multiple pages (each with a unique context) of the same browser
in parallel and taking screenshots of a focused element then on FF the
screenshot will miss the focus ring.
Chrome always behaves and I've seen rare occurrences where webkit would also
suffer from the focusringlessness.  
The element itself is correctly identified as active by the browser when
testing through `element === (document|shadowRoot).activeElement`, before and
after the screenshot.
I've created a small repro in the above repo. Please note that this repo does
everything from the node context where our tool runs the tests in the browser
context and the notifies the node context when a screenshot should be taken.
So the difference is that we focus from the browser context where the
reproduction focuses from the playwright elementHandle. That said the results
are similar.
I'm hoping this can be fixed at the playwright level and isn't a limitation at
the browser level :)
