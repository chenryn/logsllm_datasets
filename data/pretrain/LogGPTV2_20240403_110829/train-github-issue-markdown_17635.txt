Recently, I have noticed an increase in the number of problems and warnings displayed in my status bar, often showing 99+ issues. Upon clicking on the status bar, it reveals that all these errors are originating from the following file path:

```
/Applications/Visual Studio Code - Alpha.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/typescript/server/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts
```

Here is a screenshot for reference:

Additionally, the console logs the following message:

```
[Extension Host] Diagnostics for file:///Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code%20-%20Alpha.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/typescript/server/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts will be capped to 250 (actual count: 588).
```

This indicates that the diagnostics for the specified file are being limited to 250, even though there are actually 588 issues.
