More often these days (I have seen this before) my problems/warnings status
bar shows 99+ and clicking on it shows all are coming from
/Applications/Visual Studio Code -
Alpha.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/typescript/server/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts

In addition the console prints this:
[Extension Host] diagnostics for
file:///Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code%20-%20Alpha.app/Contents/Resources/app/extensions/typescript/server/typescript/lib/lib.d.ts
will be capped to 250 (actually is 588)
