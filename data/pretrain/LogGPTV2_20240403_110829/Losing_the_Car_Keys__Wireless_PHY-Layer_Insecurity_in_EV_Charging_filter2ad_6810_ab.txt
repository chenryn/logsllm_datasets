where an attacker must use “a modiﬁed cable or an adapter
plug installed on the [charger]” [8]. By contrast, we consider
a wireless threat model that permits deniability on the part of
the attacker.
Practical attacks have been demonstrated on previous-
generation infrastructure, particularly against RFID autho-
risation [35, 19], but require the attacker to clone a user’s
physical token or access debug ports on an unlocked charger.
Since electromagnetic emissions security was brought
from a military discipline into academic study by van Eck’s
work on eavesdropping video displays [68], efforts have
been devoted to studying a wide range of systems [7]. Re-
cent work has focused primarily on extracting secrets from
operating devices [3, 13], although the emissions security
of digital communication systems have been studied in the
context of eavesdropping on RS232 serial devices [66] and
100BaseT ethernet [63], along with use as a covert chan-
nel for USB [39]. While radiated emissions from powerline
communication have been studied from an electromagnetic
compatibility perspective [71], we demonstrate the ﬁrst prac-
tical wiretap attack using these emissions.
Vehicle tracking using unique identiﬁers has been studied
in the context of electronic license plates [41], tire-pressure
monitoring systems [46] and vehicular ad-hoc networks [49],
highlighting the impact upon individuals’ location privacy
and inspiring this work on new charging technologies. Prac-
tical attacks have also been demonstrated to wirelessly com-
promise in-vehicle systems [17], to unlock vehicles for theft
via remote keys [70] or passive entry [34, 37] and to misdi-
rect drivers to unwanted locations [73]. These attacks con-
sider an active attacker with different goals to those studied
here and as such could be considered orthogonal to our work.
Energy monitoring has been shown to enable the tracking
of individuals [54] and this has prompted proposals to mask
energy signatures, such as by using rechargeable vehicle bat-
teries [69], which assumes that data about vehicle power ﬂow
cannot be monitored.
4 A Near-Ideal Side-Channel
The underlying principles of electromagnetic (EM) side-
channels are very well-explored and their study has informed
modern security design [7]. Despite this, we describe here
how the use of PLC and its speciﬁc arrangement within CCS
exacerbates the vulnerability to EM attacks.
The design of PLC technologies assumes differential sig-
nalling; wherein two identical transmission lines that are
located in close proximity are driven with equal but op-
posite signals, such that those ﬁelds largely cancel and
no residual electric ﬁeld exists. Practical challenges of-
ten break these underlying assumptions for in-home PLC
deployments, leading to EM interference and susceptibility
thereto [71]. Despite EV charging requiring simpler and
more constrained wiring than domestic electrics, these as-
sumptions are still broken in CCS. A design choice to in-
corporate backwards compatibility with an earlier low-power
charging standard led to a PLC circuit design that connects
one transmission line to ground (see Fig. 2b and App. A).
This renders the signalling single-ended instead of differen-
tial. With no inverse ﬁeld, the charging circuit functions as a
suitable antenna for emissions or interference.
The nature of the PLC waveform itself, however, makes
it ideal for wireless observation and interaction. It can be
seen in Figure 4, operating as a single-ended system along-
side single-ended CAN-Bus communications for compari-
son. The radiated signal represents the gradient of the orig-
inal signal: only the changes in voltage. This introduces a
minor problem for an attacker whenever they wish to ob-
serve and a major one when they wish to inject signals
with constant voltage levels, most notably the square waves
used ubiquitously in digital communication (and in other EV
charging communication based on CAN-Bus). In observa-
tion the static voltage produces no response, so only state
transitions are detectable. The attacker uses these where they
can or hopes for the signal to leak elsewhere in the circuit and
be modulated onto a more easily-observable one [7]. In in-
jection the attacker cannot directly induce the desired static
voltage level and instead must exploit nonlinearities in com-
ponents or undersampling effects in order to synthesize the
signal at the victim [51]. The absence of components to sub-
vert, or the presence of ﬁltering in the target circuit, limit the
attacker’s opportunities.
Broadband PLC technologies predominantly use orthogo-
nal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM); in which the
data are modulated in the frequency domain before con-
structing a time-domain waveform using an inverse Fourier
transform. The resulting, transmitted waveform is a ﬁnite
sum of sinusoids and does not exhibit any non-zero static

phase-shifted replica of the original signal.
The attacker
therefore does not need to make inferences to determine the
original signal from eavesdropped observations, nor predict
what transformations an injected signal will undergo in the
receiver. They need only contend with the characteristics of
the channel itself.
5 Threat Model
While we discuss the channel properties in a bidirectional
sense above, we focus our further investigation and practi-
cal attacks on passive eavesdropping. Testing on deployed
infrastructure restricts us to only passive operation.
The attacker listens to the unintended electromagnetic ra-
diation of the EV charging communication. Their goal is
to eavesdrop on the general-purpose channel established be-

tween the vehicle and the charger; such that they obtain ac-
cess to private data it carries. The attacker can approach
close to the target vehicle and charger but cannot modify
or interfere with the equipment. They perform their attack
either in-person from a nearby location, or by situating a de-
vice at the site and leaving it unattended.
We justify this model on the basis of deniability and ac-
cess. Interfering with a vehicle or charger is an immediately
suspicious activity that would draw attention from the owner,
people nearby and operators reviewing CCTV footage. The
charging equipment is also handled regularly by drivers, so a
cable modiﬁcation or plug insert is more likely to be noticed.
By contrast parking near another vehicle at a public station
or brieﬂy visiting a private property appear to be benign ac-
tions.
6 PLC Eavesdropping Tool
Given the properties described in Section 4, the passive at-
tacker’s task is the same as that of a legitimate receiver;
to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth
(BW) of the received signal.
In a real setting, additional
complicating factors exist. While the exposed components
are the most obvious targets, any element of the communica-
tion circuit (i.e., charging plug, cabling, vehicle, charger), or
indeed multiple elements, could act as an unintentional an-
tenna(s). The size of the equipment makes potential antennas
physically distant from one another, so it can be difﬁcult to
predict the location that optimises the SNR and BW for each
target. Similarly, electric vehicles and chargers are powerful
electrical devices and even minor imperfections can intro-
duce signiﬁcant interference levels, which must be suitably
mitigated by careful positioning or ﬁltering.
Exploiting the properties and design choices of CCS, we
developed a tool for wireless eavesdropping of the under-
lying physical layer; a HomePlug GreenPHY (HPGP) net-
work. The tool is applicable to monitoring any HPGP
network as well as network management trafﬁc in Home-
Plug AV and AV2 networks, although the vehicle charging
scenario is particularly beneﬁcial for the reasons discussed
above. The tool is available open-sourced under the MIT
licence6.
The eavesdropping tool broadly resembles a normal
HPGP receiver. While the HPGP standard is public, all com-
patible implementations are proprietary and implemented as
integrated circuits. Our pure-software implementation al-
lowed far greater insight and ﬂexibility during captures how-
ever, particularly for experimenting with different prepro-
cessing steps to improve reception and collecting partial data
that would be discarded by a black-box implementation. The
receiver architecture can be seen in Figure 5. Given that Wi-
Fi shares the same OFDM underpinnings, the overall struc-
ture bears many similarities to a Wi-Fi receiver, albeit dis-
tinct in details to match the HPGP protocol speciﬁcation.
As the signal processing chain is complicated we describe
it brieﬂy here but elide full details from the main text, pro-
viding them in Appendix B instead. The signal is captured
and digitally ﬁltered to suppress local interference. Mes-
sages, known as PHY-layer Protocol Data Units (PPDUs),
are identiﬁed using a power detector and correlation of the
signal preamble against the known preamble structure. As an
OFDM technology, data are represented in individual sym-
bols throughout the Frame Control and Payload sections of

the PPDU. Once the receiver is time synchronised to the
PPDU, each symbol is processed in turn; with channel es-
timation and frequency offset correction applied before de-
modulation. With complete messages the Turbo Code er-
ror correction is processed to reduce errors and the Cyclic-
Redundancy Check checksums are calculated (a CRC24 for
the Frame Control and a CRC32 for the Payload). The ap-
plication of the Turbo Code decoder is limited in our tool,
owing primarily to the computational cost of the process. A
Turbo Code is intended to be decoded by iterating a proba-
bilisitic decoder over various rearrangements of the received
bits. We use only a single pass of the decoder and its ap-
plication already dominates the message reception time; ex-
ceeding the rest of the software processing chain. As such
we suffer from reduced error-correction performance com-
pared with an arrangement using multiple repetitions. Such
an arrangement could be expected to receive more messages
correctly in all circumstances.
7 Real-World Measurement Campaign
To explore the accessibility of the wireless side channel,
we undertook a data collection campaign with three fully-
electric vehicles: a BMW i3, a Jaguar I-PACE and a Volk-
swagen e-Golf. The campaign comprised over 800 miles of
driving and spanned six major administrative regions of the
UK. A total of 54 unique charging sessions were conducted,
at locations including service stations, highway rest stops,
superstores and hotels.
During charging sessions, we monitored radiated emis-
sions to measure the extent of signal leakage and the ability
of an attacker to eavesdrop it. Where we were able to receive
sufﬁcient emissions we used the tool detailed in Section 6 to
recover the original transmissions and examine the commu-
nication itself. For the majority of our testing we monitored

one vehicle at a time, although we did conduct testing with
multiple vehicles to examine the effects of cross-trafﬁc. Fur-
ther details of the locations and installed hardware are given
in Table 1, while examples can be seen in Figures 7 and 8.
All of the chargers are state-of-the-art at the time of writ-
ing. We tested only public chargers due to their availability,
but equivalent chargers for private use are also on sale [25].
As the chargers were public, we did not modify or interfere
with the equipment in any way. The vehicle, charger and
associated cabling remained entirely untouched. While this
prevented us from injecting messages or capturing ground-
truth via a directly-connected receiver, it was necessary to
conduct a widespread survey of existing infrastructure.
At each site, the vehicle was parked and connected to the
charger for a series of charging sessions7. The receiving an-
7Care was taken to ensure we only observed signals from our own vehi-

Table 1: Details of all tested charging locations, across the southern United Kingdom. There were a total of 54 unique charging
sessions. Multiple signal captures were taken during each session; at initialisation, during charging and at shutdown. At sites F
and H, two vehicles were charged and monitored simultaneously.
tenna was placed at various locations to investigate the recep-
tion capabilities. As noted in Section 6, deriving an optimal
attack location beforehand is challenging, so this placement
was exploratory. The locations are illustrated with a dashed
× symbol in Figure 6. Locations near the cable itself, on the
outside of the vehicle, within the vehicle, hidden in a nearby
hedge and on a nearby car were all tested. As each site had
a different layout, Figure 6 is a composite to show the ar-
rangements, rather than a meticulous depiction of any one
site.
The data were collected using a bladeRF software-deﬁned
radio, an RF Explorer Upconverter and a GNU Radio ﬂow-
graph running on a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon laptop. We
made use of an electrically-short monopole antenna to col-
lect the signal. Owing to the long wavelengths involved,
testing with a suitably-tuned directed antenna was not possi-
ble. The equipment for our experiments cost approximately
$800, although equivalent setups are available for less than
$300. The collected signal was passed through 25dB am-
pliﬁcation and upconversion (+530MHz) to bring it into the
tunable range of the bladeRF. Initial ﬁltering and packet de-
tection was performed with further GNURadio ﬂowgraphs,
while subsequent processing was implemented using Python
and numPy libraries. We tuned the receiver’s interference-
rejection ﬁlter by observation at each site, but left all other
reception parameters constant throughout.

In this section we examine the results of our testing in real
environments, both in terms of raw observable signal and
message recovery.
cles. Upon arrival we waited for any other users to leave before capturing
trafﬁc and aborted immediately if another arrived.
8.1 Eavesdropped Communications
Table 2 details the observations for each site. It indicates the
peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all the sessions, along
with the widest bandwidth (BW) with a positive SNR. It then
lists the count of all PPDUs detected, the number of data
PPDUs, the rate at which messages were well-formed and
the rate at which messages had a correct CRC32 checksum.
Every site displayed some form of unintentional wireless
channel from the PLC communication, with properties that
exceeded our expectations. The weakest signal showed 9dB
from the peak to the background and spanned a bandwidth of
4.5MHz. In the best case 25MHz could be seen, up to a peak
of 35dB. This was true irrespective of charger manufacturer,
indeed varying notably between sites with the same charger
hardware antenna location. This would seem to conﬁrm the
expectation that the site layout and variations in parking have
a substantial impact upon reception.
Figure 9 shows spectrograms of the captured signal at a se-
lection of sites, covering each tested antenna location. Over-
laid on each subﬁgure is the utilised HPGP spectrum, show-
ing the regions of the band in which transmission occurs. A
transmission will originally have a frequency-domain repre-
sentation that matches the spectral mask, with a peak power
of -50dBm in utilised regions. Apparent power levels up to
approximately -70dBm we observed, although the receiver
was not calibrated against a reference scale so this value is
uncertain. The degradation of signal across the band is clear
in every case; the ﬂat-topped spectral usage of the transmis-
sion is observable as a jagged range with many subcarriers
severely attenuated, particularly at lower frequencies. This
correlates well with studies of the wireline channel that legit-
