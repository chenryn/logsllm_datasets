User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is the best way to analyze results of a technical security assessment? I want to conduct a technical security assessment on my company's client computers with focus on Windows 10.

So far, my idea is to execute several Powershell scripts on the clients and gather the results into one central point. For example, the Powershell scripts should analyze the current version of antivirus signatures, list the installed software or the local users.

In the end, I want to answer questions like "which clients have old versions of antivirus databases?", "which clients have unauthorised software installed?", "which clients have unauthorised local users?" etc. Also, I want to see trends, so I want to store the log files time-dependent.

What is the best way to analyze such log files? Do I need something like a Log Management tool or is it too much of a good thing? Or is there even existing software for that purpose?
How would you try to solve the problem?

Assistant: It sounds to me like you want to do is a vulnerability scan. I know Nessus has the functionality to discern if virus definitions are out of date:


  Nessus will generate a finding if the scan target has an Anti-Virus agent deployed with the virus detection rules out of date. We've often received feature requests asking us to allow customers to set a grace period (in days) to avoid generating this alert. Such a preference was added this week under the heading 'Antivirus Software Check':

I'm not advocating for or against Nessus as a vulnerability scanner, but this sounds like what you're searching for.

The powershell idea is good in theory, but pretty bad in practice. How can you be sure every workstation you're managing runs the script and reports successfully?
