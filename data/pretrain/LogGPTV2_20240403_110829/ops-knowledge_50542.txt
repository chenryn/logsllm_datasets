User: I am trying to get started with Google App Engine. I have python 2.6 installed in my virtual environment which I wanted to use. But Google App Engine supports python2.5. So I want to set up another python virtual environment with python 2.5.
Can you help me how to do exactly that?
Assistant: Virtualenv lets you specify a python binary to use instead of the default. On your machine, python probably maps to /usr/bin/python, which will be a symlink to /usr/bin/python2.6. If you've got Python 2.5 installed, it will be /usr/bin/python2.5
You can create a virtualenv called envname with virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.5 envname
