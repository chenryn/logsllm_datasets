Hi, I created an env with conda, installed TF, then installed PyTorch, then
"pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers", but when I ran
'python -c "from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('sentiment-
analysis')('I hate you'))"', it gave me the ImportError. How can I resolve
this?
