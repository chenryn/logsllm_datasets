Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Timestamp: 2023-06-15 04:06:19
Component: su (pam_unix)
Process ID (PID): 21416
Event: Session closed for user cyrus
```

This format clearly separates the different elements of the log, making it easier to read and understand.
