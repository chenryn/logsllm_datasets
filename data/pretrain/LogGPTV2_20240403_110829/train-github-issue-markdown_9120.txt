It seems to me that output is line-wrapped by conhost before being sent
through the ConPTY stdout pipe. This makes sense, though it has the
unfortunate downside that in Alacritty we can't do the line-wrapping
ourselves.
This wouldn't matter that much, but when selecting and copying text in
Alacritty which has been line-wrapped by conhost, Alacritty isn't aware that
the text was originally a single line and inserts a newline into the content
placed on the clipboard.
Is it possible to disable the line wrapping by conhost?
(Perhaps this would be something that would naturally be in the "passthrough"
mode I've seen mentioned elsewhere in this issue tracker?)
