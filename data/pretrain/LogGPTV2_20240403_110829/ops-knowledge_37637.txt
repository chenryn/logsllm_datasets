Question: "A mobile device manufacturer is integrating a new security feature to protect against cold boot attacks and online attacks that can potentially leak system memory. They are implementing hardware-wrapped keys to manage storage encryption keys. Which of the following statements is true about the implementation and use of hardware-wrapped keys in this context?"
 "A": "The dedicated hardware must be capable of directly programming a subkey into an inline crypto engine and return a separate subkey to software."
 "B": "Software can unwrap and use the hardware-wrapped keys directly for file contents encryption and filenames encryption."
 "C": "The use of a TEE for implementing hardware-wrapped keys is highly recommended as it provides sufficient security against all types of attacks."
 "D": "Hardware-wrapped keys require the raw encryption keys to be stored in system memory to allow the encryption to be performed."
Answer: A
