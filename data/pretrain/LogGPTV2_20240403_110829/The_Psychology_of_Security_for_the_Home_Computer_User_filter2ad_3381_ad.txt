### Inconsistencies in Self-Reported Security Behaviors

There were inconsistencies in the self-reported security behaviors, particularly regarding password practices. For example, 24% of participants reported using passwords found in a dictionary and 24% used passwords containing personal information, which conflicts with the high percentage (51%) who claimed to use strong passwords. These discrepancies suggest that participants may not fully understand what constitutes a strong password.

### Policy Capturing Study on Risky Actions

A policy capturing study by [15] examined the intention to avoid risky actions by asking participants, "If you were to get the message again, how likely are you to click on the link in the email message?" The study found that the presence of all four threats (confidentiality, integrity, availability, and unwitting accomplice) reduced the likelihood of clicking on the link. Additionally, women's intention to click on an embedded link offering a coupon was higher than men's, even when both groups were informed of potential threats. Older adults also placed less emphasis on confidentiality threats compared to younger adults. Participants with higher levels of basic computer knowledge paid less attention to unwitting accomplice threats.

### Intention vs. Action: A Four-Stage Study

Davinson and Sillence [36] conducted a four-stage study involving 64 participants from Northumbria University's Psychology Division. The study aimed to examine the relationship between intended and actual behavior in avoiding online fraud. 

**Stage 1:** Participants completed an online survey covering demographics, internet use, experience with online financial transactions, and fraud. They rated 11 fraud-avoiding behaviors on a 7-point scale from "Always" to "Never." Two items assessed their perceived susceptibility to fraud. Each participant was then assigned a "risk score" (either "20% at risk" or "80% at risk") and provided with an information sheet from getsafeonline.org and APACS.

**Stage 2:** Participants received a paper survey assessing their intentions to behave securely over the next 10 days, including the same behaviors as in the first survey.

**Stage 3:** Half of the participants completed an interactive game-based training program called "Anti-Phishing Phil," developed at Carnegie Mellon University.

**Stage 4:** Seven days later, participants were sent an email with a survey asking about their behavior over the previous week.

The safety of participants' behavior was calculated as a summed score over the 11 behaviors, with lower scores indicating safer behavior. Results showed a statistically significant drop in the behavior measure between the first stage and subsequent stages, regardless of the risk category they were assigned. However, the behavior measure increased significantly from the second to the fourth stage, suggesting that while participants exhibited safer behavior than initially reported, their intentions did not always match their actions. The training program had no significant effect on behavior. Analysis of susceptibility reports indicated that participants consistently perceived others as being at higher risk than themselves.

### Model of Home Computer Users' Security Intentions

Ng and Rahim [37] developed a model to predict home computer users' intentions to practice specific security actions, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Their model decomposed the three factors influencing intention (Attitude, Subjective Norm, and Perceived Behavioral Control) into more specific components:

- **Attitude:**
  - **Perceived Usefulness:** How much a user believes certain actions will help.
  - **Ease of Use:** How simple the user views the action.
  - **Compatibility:** How well the action fits with the user’s values, experiences, and needs.

- **Subjective Norm:**
  - **Peer Influence:** How much a user acts based on peer expectations.
  - **Superior’s Influence:** How much a user acts based on expectations from superiors.

- **Perceived Behavioral Control:**
  - **Self-Efficacy:** The user’s confidence in their ability to take the actions.
  - **Resource Facilitating Conditions:** Requirements in time and money.
  - **Technology Facilitating Conditions:** Technological barriers (compatibility, complexity).

To reflect the home environment, Ng and Rahim's model excluded Ease of Use, Compatibility, Peer Influence, Superior’s Influence, Resource Facilitating Conditions, and Technology Facilitating Conditions. Instead, they included:
- **Family and Peer Influence:** Pressure from family and friends to take security actions.
- **Mass Media Influence:** Information from news outlets, the Internet, and television that encourages security actions.
- **Facilitating Conditions:** External factors such as time, money, and compatibility.

The model was tested with 233 undergraduate home computer users, who answered 75 questions about three security actions: updating antivirus software, backing up critical data, and using a firewall. The results generally supported the model, with some exceptions. Perceived Behavioral Control only significantly affected the intention to use a firewall, while Facilitating Conditions did not significantly influence Perceived Behavioral Control.

### Factors Influencing Safe Online Behavior

Another study [24] examined the intention to perform various self-protective security behaviors, using Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The model captured relationships between seven protection motivation variables (perceived threat susceptibility, perceived threat seriousness, coping efficacy, response efficacy, perceived benefits of safe behavior, perceived costs of safe behavior, and perceived benefits of unsafe behavior) and specific online safety behaviors. Through principal components factor analysis, 23 online behaviors were categorized into three types: Safe Online Behaviors (SOB), Privacy Protection Behavior (PPB), and Unsafe Online Behavior (UOB).

To assess the model, LaRose et al. recruited 576 undergraduates, who were asked to rate each behavior on a seven-point scale from "very likely" to "very unlikely" to be carried out within the next month. Statistical analyses showed that only about half of the expected relationships were significant. Safe online behavior intentions were unrelated to perceived threat susceptibility and threat seriousness. Coping self-efficacy beliefs, perceived efficacy of actions, and perceived benefits of safety behaviors were positively related to intentions to practice safe online behaviors. Perceived costs of safe behaviors were unrelated to intentions, while perceived benefits of unsafe behaviors were positively related to intention, suggesting that users still want the benefits of their unsafe behavior and look for ways to mitigate it through other safe behaviors.

### Predicting Continued Use of Online Antivirus Applications

Lu et al. [39] developed and evaluated a model to predict continued use of an online antivirus application (OLA), extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The extended TAM incorporated perceptions of risk, which directly influenced intention to use and indirectly affected it through Perceived Ease of Use (PE). Perceived risk was composed of seven belief variables: physical risk, functional risk, social risk, time-loss risk, financial risk, opportunity cost risk, and information risk.

To evaluate the model, Lu et al. surveyed 1,259 registered users of a trial of Trend Micro OLA. The results showed that Perceived Usefulness (PU) exerted a more significant influence on attitude/intention for the trial-and-leave group, while for the continuous-use group, PU still had a stronger effect than risk, but the effect was less significant. This suggests that once users decide to try antivirus software, they focus more on its utility than on the perceived risk.

### Inconsistent Security Practices Among Undergraduates

Undergraduates often exhibit inconsistent behavior between their security knowledge and actual practices. For instance, only 22% reported never sharing their passwords, and 51% never or rarely changed their passwords. On email, 24% opened attachments from unknown sources without checking for viruses, and 56% did so when the source appeared known. Frequent backups were done by 38%. Interestingly, there was low correlation between these actions, indicating that the group did not divide into cautious and careless, but rather a few pairings of behaviors.
