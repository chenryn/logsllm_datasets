### Version
2.6.6
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/azg65dsv/3/
### Steps to reproduce
Click the "Push" button and you will see that the focus of the window is now
on the top input. Wait a few seconds, and should now see that the focus has
been lost from the input.
### What is expected?
The first input should still be focused.
### What is actually happening?
The entire DOM is shifted around, new elements are created for no reason and
changed, while the input ends up unfocused.

My setup is pretty similar to the fiddle, I have a loading bar at the top and
an information box at the bottom. When testing it, however, a lot of weird
things happened:
  * My custom directive didn't work properly because the underlying element was changed (this was actually my fault, I have now fixed it)
  * If I selected the input before data came, it lost focus
  * My custom button ripple animation got shifted around to a button at the bottom of the screen
After debugging a little bit, I found the issue. Vue thought that those divs
were the same element when calling `sameVnode(oldEndVnode, newEndVnode)`.
Adding a custom key into the second div works wonderfully, and no more DOM
shifting, but I would like to be warned by the template compiler if something
like this could happen (or maybe key all divs?).
### Workaround
Add a `key` to the first div that is not toggled.
