Wrong results are given by subtract.reduce and divide.reduce, with respect to
the standard function reduce.  
Take a look at this piece of code:
* * *
from numpy import *
x = arange(4) # x = array([0,1,2,3])
def myadd(x,y): # re-define the binary sum function
    return x + y
print reduce(myadd, x) # 6, as expected
print add.reduce(x) # 6, as expected
def mysub(x,y): # re-define the binary diff function
    return x - y
print reduce(mysub, x) # -6, as expected
print subtract.reduce(x) # 2 ---> WRONG!
* * *
It probably depends on the wrong order of the operands in the binary operation
subtract or divide. Any non-commutative operation can lead to this problem
(and it's worth checking!).  
This code works correctly if the Numeric package is imported istead of numpy
(first row of the snippet).
