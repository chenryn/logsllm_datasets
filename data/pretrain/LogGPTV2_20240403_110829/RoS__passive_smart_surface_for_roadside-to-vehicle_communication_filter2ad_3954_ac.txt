angle of 30◦, while the RCS is measured at different azimuth angles.
We see that the ULA reflects the signals towards the symmetric
direction (−30◦), whereas the VAA redirects the signal back to the
incoming angle. Although the VAA is imperfect and there exists
leakage at other angles, the leaked signals are much weaker (5-
13 dB lower), demonstrating that the interference of the VAA to
directions other than the incident direction is negligible.
4.2 Suppressing Background Interference with
Polarization Switching
Unlike active radios, the passive RoS tag reflects a similar amount
of radar signal power as scattering objects in the environment, such
as poles, pedestrians, trees, etc.. The background reflections can
easily interfere with the desired tag reflection and compromise
its detection performance. To address this challenge, we propose
a polarization switching VAA (PSVAA) design. Most objects on
the road barely impact the polarization of incidental signals upon
reflection [18]. Our PSVAA is designed to switch the polarity of
signals orthogonally to make the signals reflected by the tag stand
out amid the background interference.
We construct the PSVAAs by extending the basic design in Sec-
tion 4.1. Specifically, we rotate half of the patch antenna elements
by 90◦ to create the second orthogonal polarization, as shown in
Fig. 7a. A slight drawback of the PSVAA is that only half of the
elements re-radiate, in contrast to the original VAA where a pair of
connected elements radiate in a symmetric manner. Consequently,
the power of the signal reflected by a PSVAA is halved, and the RCS
is reduced by 20 log10 (0.5) = 6 dB. However, in Sec. 7.2, we show
that the benefit from polarization switching is more than 14 dB,
which sufficiently compensates for the RCS loss.
The PSVAA in RoS adopts a 4 layer PCB structure, as illustrated
in the stackup in Fig. 7c. The top layer lays the patch antennas, fol-
lowed by a ground layer below, a strip-line TL, and another ground
layer. Next, we elaborate on the important design considerations.
(i) Substrate. We use two Rogers 4350B substrates (𝜖𝑟 = 3.66,
tan𝛿 = 0.0037) and a Rogers 4450F substrate (𝜖𝑟 = 3.52, tan𝛿 =
0.004) to combine the two core layers. The material properties, 𝜖𝑟
and tan𝛿, define how the substrate interact with electromagnetic
fields. The material loss parameter, tan𝛿, impacts the RCS of a
PSVAA design and is chosen carefully based on extensive HFSS
simulation under the constraint of the availability of substrates.

(ii) Patch antenna. The PSVAA adopts rectangular aperture cou-
pled patch antennas which use openings in ground planes to couple
energy to the patch from a TL. The motivation behind this design
choice was to hide the TLs in order to avoid spurious radiation that
could interfere with the reflected signals as they travel down the
line. An H-shaped aperture is used to couple the energy between
the strip-line and patch antenna. Common aperture designs use slot
openings but they generally have smaller coupling coefficients. By
using large openings such as H or E shaped apertures, the coupling
can be improved and the energy loss reduced. The aperture and
patch dimensions are optimized using Ansys HFSS by performing
parametric sweeps of the various dimensions. The optimization ter-
minates when a return loss (i.e., 𝑠11) of -10 dB is achieved throughout
the mmWave radar frequency band for the patch antenna. Fig. 7a
and Fig. 7b shows the key geometrical parameters of the PSVAA,
optimized for the 77-81 GHz band.
(ii) TL. The VAA model in Sec. 4.1 assumes only the patch antenna
elements radiate signals. In practice, the TLs can also reflect the
signals which reduces the retro-directive performance. We adopt
strip-line TLs in the PSVAA design, which minimizes spurious
radiation because they have smaller footprints and can be concealed
by the two ground planes.
The geometrical design of the TLs follows Section 4.1, with a
guided wavelength 𝜆𝑔 = 2027 𝜇m at 79 GHz for the copper layer.
We use HFSS again to optimize the length of the patch feed line
coupling stub with an objective of maximizing the antenna gain
while minimizing return loss. The TL lengths are determined by
searching for the configuration that ensures the TL phase through
the lines become equal at 79 GHz. As shown in Fig. 7b, the opti-
mized coupling stub comes out to be 837.5𝜇m terminating at 25𝜇m
from the edge of the patch, and the lengths of the three TLs are
4.106mm, 9.148mm, and 12.171mm, respectively. The lengths of
the 2nd and 3rd TLs differ from the 1st by approximately 2.5𝜆𝑔
and 4𝜆𝑔. The additional 0.5𝜆𝑔 of the 2nd TL is used to remove the
180◦ phase offset induced by the difference of feeding directions be-
tween antennas with the same polarization. For example, as shown
in Fig. 7a, the 2nd patch is fed from the left while the 4th patch is
fed from the right, which induces a 180◦ phase shift between them.
The polarization orders of the patches in Fig. 7a reduces the overall
lengths of TLs and leads to a more compact design, as shown in
Fig. 7b.
We verify the RCS performance of the PSVAA design in a similar
way to Section 4.1. Fig. 5a compares the simulated RCS of the PSVAA
and the original VAA, where the radar Tx and Rx antennas have
orthogonal polarizations. The PSVAA achieves an RCS of around
-43 dBsm for the orthogonally polarized return signal with a flat FoV
of 120◦, in contrast to around −55 dBsm for the original VAA. This

12 dB difference confirms that the PSVAA switches the polarization
while maintaining a high RCS compared to the original VAA. Fig. 5b
shows that for the original radar antennas without polarization
switching, the PSVAA acts as a normal specular reflector, where
only specular reflection at the norm direction can be received by
the radar. We further simulate the RCS performance of the PSVAA
across the 77-81 GHz band. As shown in Fig. 6a, the RCS of the
switched polarization varies by less than 4dB, thanks to a return
loss of over -10 dB. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 6b, the specular
reflection introduces a strong main lobe and various side lobes
across the frequency band, which are filtered out with the PSVAA.
The results demonstrate the wide working bandwidth of the PSVAA.
4.3 Combating Height Mismatch Using
Elevation Beam Shaping
The PSVAAs are retro-directive within the azimuth plane, but not in
elevation. Rather, when stacked vertically for spatial encoding, mul-
tiple PSVAAs together create an unwanted elevation beamforming
effect leading to an extremely narrow beamwidth. So even minor
height misalignment between the radar and tag can weaken the
RCS significantly.
Specifically, the beamwidth in radians of a vertically stack array
of antennas can be calculated as follows [9]:
𝑊 =
0.886𝜆
2𝑁𝑑𝑣
(5)
where 𝑁 is the number of antennas and 𝑑𝑣 is the spacing between
the centers of adjacent antennas. When stacking 32 PSVAAs ver-
tically, the beamwidth would be 1.1◦. At a distance of 3 m, the
radar-tag height mismatch cannot exceed 3 · tan 0.55𝑜 = 3 cm!
This is impractical in the automotive environment where the radar
height varies depending on vehicle models and road conditions.
To ensure a stable signal level in spite of the height mismatch,

one solution is to design 2-D PSVAAs which connect the pairs
of centrosymmetric antennas and are thus retro-directive in the
elevation direction as well. However, this requires long TLs which
incurs signal losses and lowers the RCS. For example, to connect
the farthest centrosymmetric antenna pair in Fig. 12a, a 10.8 cm
long TL is required, which induces a 11 dB loss given the material
selection in Sec. 4.2. Such a large TL loss makes the antenna pair
unusable. In addition, 2-D VAAs complicate the routing of the TLs
compared with 1-D VAAs, potentially requiring many more PCB
layers. Instead of the 2-D PSVAA, we design an elevation beam
shaping scheme for 1-D PSVAAs arrays. The shaping broadens the
elevation radiation pattern of the tag, which stabilizes the RCS as
the radar’s height varies.
Specifically, we treat each PSVAA in a vertical stack as a sin-
gle “antenna elementž. We then find a set of phase weights for the
“elementsž, which together lead to a flat-top radiation pattern. To
apply a specific phase weight to a PSVAA, we increase the length
of all three TLs. By adding 𝜙
2𝜋 𝜆𝑔 of TL length, a phase shift 𝜙 is
introduced to the reflected signal relative to the baseline design in
Section 4.2. Notably, the added TL length increases the height of
each PSVAA. For a given set of phase weights, the relative positions
of PSVAAs need to be adjusted accordingly to avoid overlapping.
The position change in turn causes additional changes in the rela-
tive phases of PSVAAs. In other words, the desired phase weight
of a PSVAA is a function of the weights of other PSVAAs. Such
convoluted dependencies cannot be represented using closed-form
analytical models.
To overcome this, we use a differential evolution genetic algo-
rithm (DE-GA) [55], as a meta-optimization scheme to search for
the phase weights and vertical positions of the PSVAAs, in order
to achieve a desired wide elevation beamwidth (e.g., 10◦). Fig. 8a
(left) shows the optimized geometrical layout of an example stack
of 8 PSVAAs, in contrast to the original design without elevation
beam shaping (right). The polarization of the patches is altered be-
tween adjacent PSVAAs throughout the stack to ensure an overall
symmetric RCS pattern. Fig. 8b further verifies that the correspond-
ing elevation beam shape is flatten to around 10◦ (from 2◦) and
maintains a symmetric pattern.
5 EMBEDDING INFORMATION IN THE ROS
TAG
RoS is designed as a passive, chipless and reconfigurable road sign
for automotive mmWave radars. To avoid expensive and power-
demanding mmWave circuit components, the RoS tag only consists
of multiple PSVAA stacks. A straightforward encoding scheme
is to form an array of PSVAA stacks that creates a beam pattern
with multiple lobes pointing to prescribed directions within the
azimuth plane. A radar passing by can detect the directions of these
beams and decode the embedded traffic sign information. However,
a PSVAA is 3𝜆 wide along the horizontal direction to accommodate
multiple pairs of antenna elements and achieve retroreflection. Such
a width is 12 times larger than the maximum horizontal spacing (i.e.,
𝜆
4 ) that avoids angular ambiguity of the array. As a result, with one
coding beam formed by the array of PSVAAs, at least 11 ambiguous
ambiguous beams are created, limiting the encoding angular range
and reducing the peak power of the coding beam. Moreover, strong
side lobes due to imperfection of the array may distort the pattern
and interfere the decoding process.
To overcome the limitations of the above beam pattern based en-
coding scheme, RoS adopts a model-driven spatial encoding scheme.
It directly encodes information bits using the layout of the PSVAA
stacks. A radar can measure the RCS of the tag, from which it es-
timates the spatial layout and hence decodes the information bits.
With such spatial coding, RoS can configure the information bits
at fabrication time by altering the number of PSVAA stacks and
adjusting their placement. In this section, we first model the RCS
of an RoS tag, and then introduce the spatial encoding scheme
that builds upon the RCS model. Finally, we discuss the practical
constraints of the RoS tag.
5.1 RCS Model for Multi-Stack PSVAAs
Similar to a phased array with multiple antennas, the superimposed
RCS of multiple PSVAA stacks is determined by their individual RCS
and relative positions. Suppose that 𝑀 stacks are linearly placed
and the 𝑘-th stack is located at 𝑑𝑘 , as shown in Fig. 9. The signal
reflected by the 𝑘-th stack will experience a phase shift due to its
round-trip propagation delay of 2𝑑𝑘 cos 𝜃 , where 𝜃 is the signal’s
direction of arrival (DoA). Let 𝑢 = cos 𝜃 , and denote 𝜆 as the signal
wavelength in free space. The multi-stack RCS at DoA 𝜃 is then
given by:
