At that point the UE re-synchronizes with the AUSF.
We explore the delay introduced by sync_failures using our
testbed. Figure 9 shows a PDF of the delays to connection
completion for UEs that hold identical SUPIs and attempt to
authenticate simultaneously. In order to trigger many simulta-
neous authentication requests, we use openairinterface5G [53]
to create 100 simulated UEs. We observe in that the ﬁrst suc-
cessful UE usually takes roughly 200 ms to connect, while
subsequent UEs that experienced sync_failures experience
additional delays. In our relatively small experiment the UEs
all successfully connect to the network within 1.1 seconds.
In a large-scale production network the number of UEs that
simultaneously attempt to connect would be larger. PGPP-
based networks can mitigate the issue by using more AUSFes,
which would reduce the number of UEs that each AUSF is
responsible for. Fortunately, the push for 5G will lend itself
to many AUSFes as the core network entities are being re-
designed to be virtualized and located nearer to UEs.
6 Related Work
Prior work on anonymous communications often traded
off latency and anonymity [16, 17, 48, 73]. Likewise, Tor [23],
TORFone [28], and Mixnets [11] also result in increased

on applying mixing techniques within traditional telephony
networks [56, 57]. However, such solutions are inappropriate
for cellular systems as, apart from SMS, cellular use cases
require low latency. Additionally, the architecture continues
to utilize identiﬁers (e.g., SUPI) that can expose the user
to IMSI catcher attack or allow for location tracking by the
operator. Heuser et al. proposed Phonion [32], which aims
to separate call setup from call delivery in order to nullify
the value of call data records (CDRs). PGPP takes a different
tack, reducing individually identifying information contained
within CDRs. Authenticall [63] offers content integrity and
endpoint authentication for calls, but does not seek to add
privacy within the infrastructure.
There has been extensive prior work on ﬁnding security
and privacy issues in cellular networks [35, 44, 49, 65, 68].
We decouple the SUPI from the subscriber by setting it to a
single value for all users of the network. Altering the SUPI
(or IMSI) to speciﬁcally thwart IMSI catcher and similar
passive attacks has been previously proposed [4, 41, 70, 72].
These techniques use pseudo-IMSIs (PMSIs), which are kept
synchronized between the SIM and the AUSF, or hypothetical
virtual SIMs, allowing for user identiﬁcation. We aim to go
beyond thwarting IMSI catchers, and do so while considering
active attacks without requiring fundamental changes on the
UE; we protect users from the operator itself.
Hussain et al. introduce the TORPEDO attack [36], which
allows attackers to identify the page frame index and using
that, the presence or absence of a victim in a paging broadcast
area (i.e., a tracking area). However, our use of tracking area
lists to provide additional paging anonymity (Section 4.2)
increases the location in which a victim could potentially
be, reducing the effectiveness of third-party paging-related
localization attacks. The authors also deﬁne the PIERCER
attack, which enables the attacker to reveal a victim’s IMSI
with only their phone number. PGPP nulliﬁes this attack by
making all SUPIs identical. Cellular signaling protocols have
been demonstrated by multiple works to leave users’ privacy
vulnerable to attack [24, 43, 51, 55, 67]. Our initial design
avoids signaling protocol vulnerabilities by providing data-
only rather than voice/SMS, and roaming to other networks
can be enabled by requiring home-routing rather than local
breakout. Hussain et al. identiﬁes a 5G vulnerability that
allows an attacker to neutralize GUTI refreshment in [37].
However, this requires a MiTM attack (e.g., IMSI catcher),
which necessarily means the attacker knows the victim’s loca-
tion. Additionally, the GUTI is a temporary identiﬁer, and is
not associated with a speciﬁc user.
Choudhury and Køien alter IMSI values, however both
require substantial changes to network entities [15, 42]. We
argue that a privacy-preserving architecture must be fully
compatible with existing infrastructure as the global telecom
infrastructure is truly a network of networks, comprised of
multiple operators that connect via well-known APIs.
7 Concluding Remarks
User privacy is a hotly contested topic today, especially as
law enforcement organizations, particularly in authoritarian
states, insist upon increasingly ubiquitous surveillance. In ad-
dition, law enforcement has long demanded backdoor access
to private user devices and user data [66].
We do not believe that users of PGPP, in its current form,
would be capable of withstanding targeted legal or extra-legal
attacks by nation-state organizations (e.g., the FBI or NSA),
though PGPP would likely limit the ability of any organization
to continue to operate a regime of mass surveillance of user
mobility. In addition, a more common and problematic form
of privacy loss today is due to the surreptitious sale of user
data by network providers; this is a matter PGPP addresses
in a manner that aligns with user autonomy. Our aim is to
improve privacy in line with prior societal norms and user
expectations, and to present an approach in which privacy-
enhanced service can be seamlessly deployed.
