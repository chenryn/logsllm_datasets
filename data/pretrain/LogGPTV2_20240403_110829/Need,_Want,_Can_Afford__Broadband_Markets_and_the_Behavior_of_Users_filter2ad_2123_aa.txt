**Abstract:**
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of broadband services, examining the interplay between service characteristics (such as capacity, latency, and packet loss), pricing, and user demand. By leveraging natural experiments, we move beyond mere correlation to explore causal relationships. Previous research has largely focused on performance and availability, but there is a gap in understanding how these services are utilized and how market dynamics influence their use. Our analysis is based on 23 months of data from 53,000 end hosts and residential gateways across 160 countries, combined with a global survey of retail broadband plans. We find a strong correlation between capacity and demand, even though users rarely fully utilize their connections. This relationship follows a law of diminishing returns, with smaller increases in demand at higher capacities. Despite a fourfold increase in global IP traffic over three years, user demand for a given bandwidth capacity remained constant, suggesting that users upgrade to higher service tiers rather than fully utilizing their existing connections. Using natural experiments, we also examine the causality between price, service quality, and user demand. Our findings provide valuable insights into how user behavior and market features shape broadband networks and the Internet.

**1. Introduction:**
Broadband networks, a rapidly growing and economically significant sector of the Internet, have attracted attention from researchers, network operators, and policymakers. Over the past decade, the number of broadband networks has surged, with more than 60 countries reporting fixed or mobile broadband penetration above 25%, and over 70 countries where the majority of the population is online. Broadband access is recognized as a key driver of social and economic development, with some governments and the UN declaring it a basic human right.

While recent studies have shed light on the performance and availability of broadband services, there is a lack of understanding regarding how these services are used and how market dynamics impact their utilization. Our work aims to address this gap by examining the broader context of broadband services. Specifically, we seek to understand:
- How much bandwidth do people actually need?
- How does price affect usage?
- Do users in developing and developed countries impose different demands on their services?
- What is the impact of connection quality on usage?

We analyze over 23 months of data from 53,000 end hosts and residential gateways in 160 countries, along with a global survey of retail broadband plans. Our analysis quantifies the relationship between user demand, retail prices, and service performance. We observe a law of diminishing returns in the relationship between broadband capacity and user demand, indicating that adding extra capacity to an already wide broadband line results in only minor increases in demand. Surprisingly, despite a fourfold increase in global IP traffic over five years, subscribers' demand for a given bandwidth capacity remained constant, suggesting that users upgrade to higher service tiers when their demand grows rather than fully utilizing their existing connections.

Our methodology includes the application of natural experiments to examine the interaction between price, service quality, and user demand. We find that higher broadband prices increase demand when comparing users of similar capacities across markets. Additionally, very high packet loss rates (over 1%) and latencies (above 500 ms) result in significantly lower usage.

**2. Analysis Methods and Datasets:**
In this section, we describe the datasets and methodologies used in our study. We rely on three primary datasets:
- Residential gateway data from the FCC's "Measuring Broadband America" effort, which includes measurements of link capacity, latency, and packet loss, as well as hourly recordings of network traffic.
- End-host data from Dasu, a network experimentation and broadband measurement client, which provides detailed information on home network configuration and network traffic.
- A compilation of international retail broadband connectivity plans, made available by Google, covering 1,523 service plans across 99 countries.

We also discuss the potential biases in our datasets and the steps taken to mitigate them, such as focusing on measurements when users are not actively using BitTorrent and using neighbor matching to ensure close matches.

**2.1 Datasets:**
- **Residential Gateway Data:** Collected from residential gateways distributed to broadband users in the US as part of the "Measuring Broadband America" effort. This data includes measurements of link capacity, latency, and packet loss, as well as hourly recordings of network traffic.
- **End-Host Data:** Collected from Dasu, a network experimentation and broadband measurement client. Dasu records network usage data from the localhost and home network, providing detailed information on home network configuration and network traffic.
- **Connectivity Plans:** A compilation of international retail broadband connectivity plans, made available by Google, covering 1,523 service plans across 99 countries. This dataset includes information on upload and download speeds, monthly traffic limits, and monthly costs in local currencies.

**2.2 Broadband Network Characteristics:**
We describe the diversity of broadband connections in our global dataset, presenting distributions of measured capacity, latency, and packet loss. The median user download capacity is 7.4 Mbps, with an interquartile range of 14.3 Mbps. Approximately 10% of users have download capacities below 1 Mbps, while the top 10% have capacities above 30 Mbps. The average round-trip time (RTT) to the nearest NDT servers is about 100 ms, with the top 5% of users experiencing latencies above 500 ms. Packet loss rates are generally low, with approximately 14% of users experiencing average loss rates above 1%.

**2.3 Methodology:**
The main goal of our study is to provide insights into the impact of broadband service market characteristics on network usage. We focus on the following market features: connection capacity, the price of broadband access, the cost of increasing capacity, and connection quality. Given the rapid pace of development in broadband and the reported growth in network traffic, we also conduct a longitudinal analysis of user demands on broadband services.

To address the challenge of conducting controlled experiments at a global scale, we use natural experiments and related study designs. By matching users in treated and untreated groups, we simulate random or as-good-as-random assignment, allowing us to infer causal relationships. For example, to test if bandwidth capacity affects user demand, we pair users with similar connection quality and broadband market conditions and check if the user with higher capacity has higher demand.

**Conclusion:**
Our study offers several insights into the interplay between user demand and broadband market features, valuable to the research community, network operators, and policymakers. For network operators, understanding how user behavior changes with the network and broadband market can inform better network planning and operation. For policymakers, our work provides a firmer statistical foundation for discussions on broadband incentives.
