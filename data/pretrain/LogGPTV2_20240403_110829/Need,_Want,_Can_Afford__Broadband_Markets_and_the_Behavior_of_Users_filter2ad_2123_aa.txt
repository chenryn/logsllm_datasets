ABSTRACT
We present the ﬁrst study of broadband services in their
broader context, evaluating the impact of service character-
istics (such as capacity, latency and loss), their broadband
pricing and user demand. We explore these relationships,
beyond correlation, with the application of natural experi-
ments. Most eﬀorts on broadband service characterization
have so far focused on performance and availability, yet we
lack a clear understanding of how such services are being
utilized and how their use is impacted by the particulars of
the market. By analyzing over 23-months of data collected
from 53,000 end hosts and residential gateways in 160
countries, along with a global survey of retail broadband
plans, we empirically study the relationship between broad-
band service characteristics, pricing and demand. We show
a strong correlation between capacity and demand, even
though subscribers rarely fully utilize their links, but note a
law of diminishing returns with relatively smaller increases
in demand at higher capacities. Despite the fourfold increase
in global IP traﬃc, we ﬁnd that user demand on the network
over a three year period remained constant for a given
bandwidth capacity. We exploit natural experiments to
examine the causality between these factors. The reported
ﬁndings represent an important step towards understanding
how user behavior, and the market features that shape it,
aﬀect broadband networks and the Internet at large.

INTRODUCTION
As one of the most economically signiﬁcant and fastest
growing sectors of the Internet [19], broadband networks
have attracted interest from researchers, network operators,
and policy makers. Over the past decade, the number of
broadband networks has increased rapidly. The latest “State
of Broadband” reports that there are over 60 countries where
ﬁxed or mobile broadband penetration is above 25% and
more than 70 countries where the majority of the population
is online [4]. Providing broadband Internet access is known
to be instrumental in social and economic development [35].
Several governments (including France, Finland and Spain)
and the UN have even labeled broadband access a basic
human right, similar to education and water.
While several recent and ongoing eﬀorts have shed light on
the performance and availability of broadband services [1,2,
5, 12, 20, 28, 31, 33, 34], we lack a clear understanding of how
these services are being used and how this use is impacted
by the particulars of the market. The goal of our work is to
examine broadband services in this broader context. How
much bandwidth do people actually need? How does price
aﬀect usage? Do users in developing and developed countries
impose diﬀerent demands on their services? What is the
impact of connection quality on usage?
We analyze over 23 months of information collected from
53,000 end hosts [30] and residential gateways [15] in 160
countries, along with a global survey of retail broadband
plans [27]. We quantify the relationship between user
demand on the network, retail price of available broadband
services and the performance of the service to which the
user subscribes. We observe a law of diminishing returns
in the relationship between broadband capacity and the
average/peak demand users put on their broadband link,
implying that adding extra capacity on an already wide
broadband line leads to a minor increment in user demand.
Looking at the longitudinal data, we ﬁnd, somewhat
surprisingly, that despite the fourfold increase in global IP
traﬃc over the past ﬁve years [10], subscribers’ demand
in the same bandwidth capacity class remained constant,
indicating that users “jump” to a higher service when their
demand grows, rather than fully utilize their existing pipe.
We study in depth the service upgrade dynamics and report
our ﬁndings.
In a study such as this, controlled experiments are not
feasible for studying the features of interest at scale. A
key contribution of our work is thus a methodology for
combining broadband measurement and retail price datasets
along with the application of natural experiments to get
73to a problem otherwise impossible to tackle. We use
natural experiments to examine the interaction between
price, the quality of services available, and users’ demands.
We show that higher broadband prices increase demand
when comparing users of similar capacities across markets.
Additionally, we ﬁnd that very high packet loss rates (over
1%) and latencies (above 500 ms) result in signiﬁcantly lower
usage.
Our study oﬀers several insights on the interplay between
user demand and broadband market features that are of
value to the research community, network operators and
policy makers. For network operators, an understanding of
how user behavior changes with the network and broadband
market can better inform network planning and operation.
For policy makers, the work provides a ﬁrmer statistical
footing for discussions on broadband incentives.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we
explain our analysis methodology, describe our datasets, and
summarize the performance of the broadband connections
seen in our global dataset. We explore the impact of
capacity on demand in Sec. 3, followed by a longitudinal
study that investigates how demand changes over time in
Sec. 4. In Sec. 5, 6, and 7 we study the impact of the price
of broadband access, the cost of increasing capacity, and the
connection quality on user demand, respectively. We then
review related work in Sec. 8, summarize and discuss our
ﬁndings in Sec. 9, and conclude in Sec. 10.
2. ANALYSIS METHODS AND DATASETS
In the following paragraphs we describe the three datasets
we rely on for analysis, including a summary of key charac-
teristics for the broadband connections they capture. We
close the section with a brief discussion of the goals and
methodology of our study.
2.1 Datasets
Our study builds on three datasets, two of broadband
connections including:
(i) measurements from residential
gateways in the US, and (ii) detailed end-host collected data
on broadband connections from around the world, and (iii)
a compilation of retail broadband connectivity plans made
available by Google [27]. We describe each of these in the
following paragraphs.
Residential gateway data. Since 2010, the FCC, in
collaboration with SamKnows, has publicly shared data
collected from residential gateways distributed to broadband
users around the US as part of the “Measuring Broadband
America” eﬀort [15]. Users that participate in this study
were either selected to participate by their ISP or signed up
through SamKnows’ website. The data collected from these
gateways includes measurements of link capacity, latency
and packet loss as well as hourly recordings of the number
of bytes sent and received over the WAN link.
End host data. Our end-host collected dataset comes
from Dasu [30], a previously released network experimenta-
tion and broadband measurement client. Dasu is available
as both an extension to BitTorrent and as a standalone
client. As an incentive for adoption, Dasu informs users of
their ISP’s performance, providing detailed information on
their home network conﬁguration, the volume of network
traﬃc sent and received by the localhost, the volume of
detected cross traﬃc in the home network, and the results of
performance measurements on their ISP (e.g. a comparison
of their ISP’s web browsing and DNS performance). Dasu
records network usage data from the localhost and home
network to account for cross traﬃc during characterization
or the execution of network experiments.
Since its release, Dasu has been installed by over 100,000
users in over 160 countries, with the majority of clients
using the BitTorrent extension. From this dataset, we select
users that either have UPnP enabled on their home gateway
device or those that were directly connected to their modem
(thus their machine is the only device generating traﬃc).
UPnP-enabled gateways provide byte counters that we use
to measure activity on the link, taking into account issues
with UPnP counters raised in other works [11,29]. For users
directly connected to their modem, we use byte counters
available from netstat to monitor network usage (available
by default on most popular operating systems). Traﬃc byte
counters are collected at approximately 30 second intervals
with some variations due to scheduling.
As it is the case with all observational studies, there is a
concern about potential biases in our datasets, coming either
from P2P or SamKnow’s users (e.g., uniquely demanding
users, early-adopters or “geek-eﬀect” [5, 20, 25]. We account
for some of these issues throughout our analysis by, for
instance, focusing on measurements gathered when users are
not actively downloading/uploading content on BitTorrent,
restricting our users to those directly connected to a modem
or wirelessly connected to a UPnP-enabled one, using
neighbor matching with a caliper to ensure close matches.
On the potential biases with our P2P users’ data, we show
in Sec. 3.1 that the average demand of Dasu users in the
US – when not actively using BitTorrent – is comparable to
that of participants in the FCC’s study.
Connectivity plans. Our third dataset is a compilation
of international retail broadband connectivity plans, made
available by Google on their “Policy by the Numbers”
blog [27]. This data was compiled by Communications
Chambers, a consultant group, by visiting the websites of
broadband service providers around the world. The dataset
covers 1,523 service plans across 99 countries.
It includes
information on the upload and download speeds of each
plan, the monthly traﬃc limits, and monthly cost in the
local currency. We selected this dataset over those provided
by the FCC, OECD, or ITU given the breadth of countries
included and the depth of plans listed. The FCC and
OECD datasets focus on the US and members of the OECD
while the ITU dataset only includes a single service plan for
each country. In a few cases, we expanded this dataset by
manually visiting the websites of ISPs in countries where we
had users but no broadband price data.
To directly compare the price of broadband plans across
diﬀerent economies, we convert the monthly cost to US
dollars. We account for diﬀerences in relative purchasing
power in each country by using the purchasing power parity
(PPP) to market exchange ratio.
In most cases, this
is included in the broadband service survey provided by
Google. When that is not the case, we use publicly available
data from the International Monetary Fund’s website1. All
monetary ﬁgures throughout this work are normalized by
purchasing power parity, including the GDP per capita data
provided by the International Monetary Fund that we use
later in our case study.

2.2 Broadband Networks Characteristics
We now describe the diversity of broadband connections
in our global dataset, presenting distributions of their
measured capacity, latency and packet loss. All the Dasu
data were collected by running M-Lab’s Network Diagnostic
Tool (NDT) [23] within Dasu. NDT reports the upload and
download capacity of a connection, as well as its end-to-end
latency and packet loss rates.
Capacity. Figure 1a shows a CDF of the maximum
download capacities, in Mbps, measured over each user’s
connection in our dataset. Our distribution has a median
user download capacity of 7.4 Mbps and interquartile range
of 14.3 Mbps (from 3.1 Mbps to 17.4 Mbps). Approximately
10% of users have download capacities below 1 Mbps, while
the top 10% of users have capacities above 30 Mbps.
Latency. For latency, we measured the average latency
to the closest NDT measurement server. Since measurement
servers are hosted in a diverse set of networks of content
providers (e.g. Google) and content distribution networks
(e.g. Level 3), we believe such measurements provides
a reasonable estimate of the latency to popular content.
Figure 1b shows the distribution of measured latencies. We
ﬁnd that a “typical” user in our dataset has an average RTT
of about 100 ms to the nearest NDT servers. The top 5%
of users had an average latency above 500 ms. Based on the
organization names that we found via whois lookups, the
majority of connections with very high latencies appeared to
be connecting over wireless modems or satellite providers.
Packet loss. Figure 1c shows the distribution of average
packet loss rates reported by NDT tests. While the loss
rate is relatively low for most users (less than 0.1%),
approximately 14% of users saw an average loss rate above
1%. For the top 1% of users, average loss rates were above
10%. As was the case with high latency connections, the
organization names of networks with very high packet loss
rates indicated they were satellite or wireless (e.g. WiMAX,
cellular) services.
2.3 Methodology
The main goal of our study is to provide insight into
the impact of broadband service market characteristics on
network usage. Speciﬁcally, we study the impact of the
following market features: connection capacity, the price
of broadband access, the cost of increasing capacity, and
connection quality. While there are many other variables
that can aﬀect user behavior, this set covers the key
characteristics of broadband service markets. Given the
rapid pace of development in broadband and the reported
growth in network traﬃc, we also conduct a longitudinal
analysis of user demands on broadband services.
Beyond gathering a suﬃciently large and diverse per-
spective of broadband connections, a key challenge for a
macroscopic study such as ours is the nature of experiments
one is able to conduct. Classical controlled experiments
– where subjects in the study are randomly assigned to
“treated” and “untreated” groups for comparison – are clearly
not feasible at a global scale.
It is also unlikely that
the features we explore are independent, e.g., one would
assume that price or service diversity can impact capacity
and service quality. This has been a long, well understood
problem in a range of ﬁelds, from epidemiology to sociology
and economics. We address this challenge, as many studies
do in those domains, by resorting to natural experiments in
our analysis [14].
By using natural experiments [14] and related study
designs, we remedy the fact that we cannot control the
application of a treatment, Matching users in our treated
group with similar users in the untreated group we sim-
ulate random or as-good-as-random assignment, manually
ensuring that diﬀerences are evenly distributed between the
two groups. This allows us to infer whether or not the
relationship observed are likely to be causal. For example,
to test if bandwidth capacity aﬀects user demand, we pair
users that are similar in terms of connection quality and
broadband market. We then check if the user with higher
