# HoneyIM: A Novel Detection and Suppression Mechanism for IM Malware

## 1. Introduction
HoneyIM is a novel detection and suppression mechanism designed to defend against Instant Messaging (IM) malware in enterprise-like networks. Unlike previous defense schemes, HoneyIM introduces decoy users to detect IM malware. By leveraging the basic spreading characteristics of IM malware, HoneyIM ensures near-zero false positives. With accurate detection, it achieves instant network-wide blocking and notifies network administrators in real-time about infected machines and malware features.

## 2. Experimental Results and Analysis

### 2.1 Effect Comparisons between HoneyIM and IM Throttling
The following figures compare the effectiveness of HoneyIM and IM throttling under different conditions:

- **Figure 5.** Effect comparisons between HoneyIM and IM throttling:
  - **|V| = 1000, E[D] = 8**
  - **|V| = 6000, E[D] = 8**
  - **|V| = 6000, E[D] = 16**

- **Figure 6.** Effects of randomly selecting infection targets on HoneyIM:
  - **Pr = 1**
  - **Pr = 0.5**
  - **Pr = 0.25**

### 2.2 Coverage and Effectiveness
The coverage of HoneyIM is evaluated based on the percentage of detected malicious activities. The results are as follows:

- **Coverage of HoneyIM (%)**
  - **Pr = 1**
  - **Pr = 0.5**
  - **Pr = 0.25**

### 2.3 Random Target Selection
To study the effect of random target selection on HoneyIM, we conducted experiments with three different probabilities (p = 1, 0.5, 0.25). The results indicate that the average number of infected users increases as the probability decreases. However, the difference among the curves becomes negligible with increased coverage. Overall, random target selection has little effect on HoneyIM's performance.

## 3. Prototype Testing
We tested the HoneyIM prototype using a generic approach to overcome the challenges posed by invalid known malicious URLs. We mimicked IM malware by sending self-collected malicious URLs to decoy accounts. These URLs, in principle, have no difference from those carried by known IM malware in terms of web exploits. 

- **URL Processing Time:** HoneyIM completes deep-inspection within 30 seconds.
- **Detection and Notification:** HoneyIM successfully detects all malicious URLs, updates the URL blacklist, and sends attack information via SMS and email.
- **File Transfer Handling:** For emulated malicious file transfers, HoneyIM automatically receives files, reveals file names to the suppression module, and sends file payloads via email. The entire process takes only a few seconds.

## 4. Discussion
In previous sections, we assumed that IM malware always attempts to infect all online contacts. However, "smart" IM malware may use non-hit-all strategies, such as targeting only active contacts or activating propagation after receiving a message. To counter this, HoneyIM can be enhanced with interaction functionality to mimic human users, making it harder for IM malware to distinguish decoys from normal users.

## 5. Conclusion
HoneyIM is a robust and flexible solution for detecting and suppressing IM malware. Simulation studies and real experiments demonstrate its effectiveness even with a small portion of IM users equipped with decoy accounts. The generic design of HoneyIM allows it to be implemented on networks using either enterprise or public IM services.
