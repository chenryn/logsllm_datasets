User: I am writing a shell script, and before the script runs I want to verify that the user has Python 3 installed. Does anyone know or have any ideas of how I could check that, and the output be a boolean value?
Assistant: execute the following command.
which python3 and check the exit status of the command $?. it will be 0 if user has python 3 installed, 1 otherwise.
