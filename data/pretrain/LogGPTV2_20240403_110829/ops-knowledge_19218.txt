Question: An Android developer is implementing a feature in their application that requires listening for certain system events. The developer is considering using either a broadcast receiver registered in the manifest or dynamically in the code. They are also exploring the use of LocalBroadcastManager for internal app communication. Which of the following statements accurately reflects the security considerations and best practices for implementing broadcast receivers in an Android application?
"A": "Registering a broadcast receiver in the manifest for implicit broadcasts is unrestricted, regardless of the Android version targeted by the application.",
"B": "Using LocalBroadcastManager can improve security by ensuring that intents are only received from the internal app, but it is deprecated and should be replaced with LiveData for inter-component communication.",
"C": "Implicit broadcasts received by dynamically registered broadcast receivers can contain the user's location or personally identifiable data.",
"D": "If a broadcast receiver is registered dynamically in code, there's no need to assign a priority since it does not affect the order in which broadcasts are received."
Answer: B
