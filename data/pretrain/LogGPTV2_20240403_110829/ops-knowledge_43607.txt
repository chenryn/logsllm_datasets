User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Cant run rc.local manually and doesn't run automatically on ubuntu This is quite a simple one. I created an rc.local file here:

/etc/rc.local


I made it executable. However, it doesn't run when I boot the server. I can see it in the directory and when I try to run it manually I get this message:

root@:/etc# rc.local
rc.local: command not found


My rc.local file reads as follows:

#!/bin/sh -e

# FUNCTIONS
function setup_logs
{
    exec &gt; &gt;(tee -a /var/log/deploy.log)
    exec 2&gt; &gt;(tee -a /var/log/error.log)
}

# COMMANDS
setup_logs
apt-get update                              # Update aptitude list
apt-get -y dist-upgrade                     # Upgrade aptitude programs
cd /etc/spider &amp;&amp; git pull                  # Update deployment code
cd /etc/code &amp;&amp; git pull                    # Update library code
cd /etc/code &amp;&amp; deployment.sh               # Run deployment script
exit 0


For the life of me I don't understand where I am going wrong, can anyone give me some help?

Assistant: Ubuntu is per default using dash as Shell, and dash doesn't know the keyword function.

Try to change the shebang to

#!/bin/bash


and execute again.

According to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh/#function , it should also help if you just remove the word function and write parentheses behind the function name:

setup_logs()    {
    exec &gt; &gt;(tee -a /var/log/deploy.log)
    exec 2&gt; &gt;(tee -a /var/log/error.log)
}
