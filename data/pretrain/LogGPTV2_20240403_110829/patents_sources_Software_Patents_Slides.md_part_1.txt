How to Protect Software?
•
Some computer software can be protected by
multiple mechanisms:
–
Patent
–
Copyright (source or object code)
•
Does not protect methods of operation
–
Trade secret
•
No protection against reverse engineering
–
Contracts
5
What is a Patent?
•
A Patent is an exclusive monopoly granted by
a Government to an inventor over his
invention for a limited period of time.
–
Limited time (typically 20 years).
–
Limited territory (issuing country).
–
The patentee is given a market monopoly
and the invention is disclosed to the public.
20 years

Copyright Patent
Copyright does not protect Protects ideas that have been
ideas. It protects expression reduced to practice
Long term protection Short term protection
Fair Use No Fair Use
Protects against copying Innocent infringement not a
defense
Protection is automatic Extensive examination
(no formalities) process
Originality Novelty and Nonobviousness

Why Get a Patent?
•
Secrecy protection is sometimes impossible
•
Non-secret inventions can be copied at low
cost forcing market price down to levels not
justifying investments of investors.
–
The free rider problem
•
Patents are valuable to start-up companies
to attract investments.

Historical Background
•
Venice, Italy 1474 - first patent law
•
England 1561 (Elisabeth I) letters patent
–
Abuse of the system
–
Case of Monopolies [Darcy v. Allin]
–
Statute of Monopolies 1624
•
U.S. 1790 – patent act. U.S. 1836 - 1st modern patent act
•
U.K. 1883 – 1st modern patent act
10
What Can Be Patented?
In the United States:
•
Utility patents
–
Machine
–
Composition of matter (pharmaceuticals)
–
Method, Process
•
Software, Method of doing business
–
An article of manufacture
–
An improvement of an invention that fits within one
of the first four categories
•
Design patents
•
Plant patents
11
What is a Business Method?
•
The expression "business methods" refers to a
broad category of subject matter which often
relates to financial, marketing and other
commercial activities
•
Business methods are frequently implemented
using computers
•
Historically, “methods of doing business” were not
patentable until the court case State Street Bank &
Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc. (1998)
12
What Can Not Be Patented?
In the United States:
•
Laws of nature (e.g., law of gravity)
•
Abstract ideas (e.g., mathematical formulas)
•
Physical phenomena.
See: Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63 (1972);
Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584 (1978); and
Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175 (1981).
13
Patent Specification
•
A utility patent application must satisfy very
stringent standards
–
Abstract, Background, Summary of invention
–
Brief description of Drawings, Drawings
–
Brief description of the preferred embodiments
–
Claims - describe legal rights of the patent owner
•
A patentee seeks to maximize the scope of
patent, whereas the public benefits from
limiting the scope so that more inventions can
be brought out.
–
Designing around a patent
14
What do you get?
•
True or False: If I got a patent, am I free to
manufacture and sell my invention?
False
•
A patent is a “negative right” – it gives the right to
exclude others from practicing your invention
–
Making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing
•
You may not be able to practice the invention
–
Someone else may have a broader patent.
•
Broad patents may block the use of rights granted by
narrower (“improvement”) patents.
15
(Patent) Law is Territorial
•
Example: Harvard Transgenic Mouse (Oncomouse)
–
U.S. patent (1988) Transgenic non-human mammals
–
Europe: Moral issues.
•
European patents will not be granted for inventions which
would be contrary to the 'ordre public' or morality.
–
Canada: The claim involving the mouse itself is not
patentable.
•
Court Decision: The Question is whether the words
"manufacture" and "composition of matter", within the
context of the Patent Act, are sufficiently broad to include
higher life forms. Conclusion: higher life forms are not
patentable.
16
Harmonization is Difficult
•
The are differences among countries
–
in patenting software, algorithms and business
methods
–
in law (interpretation), culture, interests, politics
–
between developing countries and industrialized
countries
•
Patent Law Treaties
–
WIPO (http://www.wipo.int/)
–
TRIPS [World Trade Organization]: minimal standard.
17
Patent Litigation
•
Claim interpretation
–
What did the words of the claims mean to one of
ordinary skill in the art when the application was
filed?
•
Infringement
–
[35 U.S.C. § 271(a)]: “Except as otherwise provided in this title,
whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any
patented invention, within the United States or imports into the
United States any patented invention during the term of the patent
therefor, infringes the patent”.
•
Invalidity
–
Given the claim interpretation, is the claim valid?

Patents Cost
•
Cost in U.S. $5,000 to $15,000 per application
–
Patent drafting $5000-$7500
•
“The minimum cost of taking a relatively simple
patent infringement lawsuit through trial would be
half a million dollars”
[M. H. Jester, Patents and Trademarks Plain & Simple, page 124]
•
RIM v. NTP
–
Research in Motion’s Blackberry product allegedly
infringed NTP’s patents
–
Settlement: $612,500,000

Constitutional Basis
U.S. Constitution Art. I, §8(8)
“Congress shall have Power …
To promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts,
By securing for Limited Times
to Authors and Inventors
PATENT
the exclusive Right
COPYRIGHT
to their respective Writings and Discoveries.”
35 U.S.C. §101
(Patent Act 1952)
“Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful
1. process (method),
2. machine,
UTILITY
3. manufacture, or
Patentable Subject Matter
4. composition of matter, or
5. any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a
patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements
of this title”.
Subject Matter Eligibility - a “threshold” test
Exceptions: laws of nature, natural phenomenon, abstract idea.
35 USC §112
•
Adequate written description
•
Enablement
The specification shall contain a written description
of the invention, and of the manner and process of
making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and
exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art
to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly
connected, to make and use the same, and shall set
forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of
carrying out his invention.
24
35 USC §102
•
Novelty
–
A necessary requirement in any patent system.
–
The invention must be “new”.
–
The invention must differ from existing public information
disclosing the state of the art.
–
Singe prior-art reference.
–
On September 16, 2011 President Obama signed the
‘America Invents Act’ into law. It changes 35 U.S.C. §102
and other sections. A major change: from ‘first-to-invent’
to ‘first-to-file’ (not yet effective).
A person shall be entitled to a patent unless —
(a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or
patented or described in a printed publication in this or a
foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant
for patent, or (b) … (c) …
[Notice: this is §102(a) before the AIA amendment]
25
What is Prior Art?
–
Prior Art includes:
•
Patents
•
Patent application publications
•
Non-patent publications (e.g. scientific
publications)
–
Prior art search is used to determine
whether inventions are novel and
nonobvious.
26
35 USC §103 [Nonobviousness]
“(a) A patent may not be obtained … if the ... subject
matter as a whole
would have been obvious
at the time the invention was made
to a person having ordinary skill in the art
to which said subject matter pertains.
Patentability shall not be negatived by the
manner in which the invention was made.”
27
Compare the invention as a whole to the prior art
–
In the early 1980s, scientists at 3M combined an
adhesive (that seemed to be useless because it did
not permanently stick) with note-sized paper to create
Post-It® notes.
–
The invention became a worldwide commercial
success.
