### Talk Outline
1. **Protecting Intellectual Property**
2. **Introduction to Patents**
3. **Patentability (in the U.S.)**
4. **Patentability of Software**
5. **Patenting Business Methods**
6. **Software Patents in Europe**

### How to Protect Software?
Some computer software can be protected by multiple mechanisms:
- **Patent**: Protects methods of operation.
- **Copyright**: Protects source or object code but not methods of operation.
- **Trade Secret**: Provides no protection against reverse engineering.
- **Contracts**: Customized agreements for specific protections.

---

### What is a Patent?
A patent is an exclusive monopoly granted by a government to an inventor over their invention for a limited period, typically 20 years. This monopoly is geographically limited to the issuing country. In exchange, the invention is disclosed to the public.

**Key Points:**
- **Limited Time**: Typically 20 years.
- **Limited Territory**: Issuing country.
- **Market Monopoly**: Exclusive rights to the invention.
- **Disclosure**: The invention is made public.

### Copyright vs. Patent
| **Copyright** | **Patent** |
|---------------|------------|
| **Ideas Protected** | Does not protect ideas. | Protects ideas reduced to practice. |
| **Duration** | Long-term protection. | Short-term protection (typically 20 years). |
| **Fair Use** | Allowed. | Not allowed. |
| **Defense Against Copying** | Protects against copying. | Innocent infringement is not a defense. |
| **Protection Process** | Automatic (no formalities). | Extensive examination process. |
| **Requirements** | Originality. | Novelty and nonobviousness. |

---

### Why Get a Patent?
- **Secrecy Protection**: Sometimes impossible to maintain secrecy.
- **Market Dynamics**: Non-secret inventions can be copied at low cost, driving prices down and deterring investment.
- **Investment Attraction**: Patents are valuable for start-up companies to attract investors.

---

### Historical Background
- **1474**: Venice, Italy - First patent law.
- **1561**: England - Letters patent under Elizabeth I.
- **1624**: England - Statute of Monopolies (Darcy v. Allin).
- **1790**: U.S. - First patent act.
- **1836**: U.S. - First modern patent act.
- **1883**: U.K. - First modern patent act.

### What Can Be Patented in the United States?
- **Utility Patents**:
  - Machine
  - Composition of matter (e.g., pharmaceuticals)
  - Method, Process
  - Software, Business Methods
  - Article of manufacture
  - Improvement of an existing invention
- **Design Patents**
- **Plant Patents**

---

### What is a Business Method?
- **Definition**: Broad category of subject matter often related to financial, marketing, and other commercial activities.
- **Implementation**: Frequently implemented using computers.
- **Historical Context**: Traditionally not patentable until the State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc. (1998) case.

---

### What Cannot Be Patented in the United States?
- **Laws of Nature** (e.g., law of gravity)
- **Abstract Ideas** (e.g., mathematical formulas)
- **Physical Phenomena**

**Notable Cases:**
- Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63 (1972)
- Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584 (1978)
- Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175 (1981)

---

### Patent Specification
A utility patent application must meet stringent standards, including:
- **Abstract, Background, Summary of Invention**
- **Brief Description of Drawings, Drawings**
- **Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments**
- **Claims**: Describe the legal rights of the patent owner.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Maximizing Scope**: Patentee seeks broad coverage, while the public benefits from narrower scope to encourage more innovation.
- **Designing Around a Patent**: Narrower patents can be circumvented more easily.

---

### What Do You Get with a Patent?
- **False Statement**: If you have a patent, you are free to manufacture and sell your invention.
- **Correct Understanding**: A patent is a negative right, giving the right to exclude others from practicing your invention (making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing).

**Limitations:**
- **Infringement by Others**: Someone else may have a broader patent that blocks your use.
- **Broad vs. Narrow Patents**: Broader patents can prevent the use of rights granted by narrower (improvement) patents.

---

### Patent Law is Territorial
- **Example**: Harvard Transgenic Mouse (Oncomouse)
  - **U.S. Patent (1988)**: Transgenic non-human mammals.
  - **Europe**: Moral issues; higher life forms not patentable.
  - **Canada**: Higher life forms not patentable.

---

### Harmonization is Difficult
- **Differences Among Countries**: Patenting software, algorithms, and business methods varies due to differences in law, culture, interests, and politics.
- **Patent Law Treaties**:
  - **WIPO**: World Intellectual Property Organization.
  - **TRIPS**: Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (minimal standard).

---

### Patent Litigation
- **Claim Interpretation**: Determining what the claims meant to one of ordinary skill in the art when the application was filed.
- **Infringement**: [35 U.S.C. § 271(a)] defines infringement.
- **Invalidity**: Assessing the validity of the claim given the interpretation.

**U.S. Patent System:**
- **Supreme Court**
- **Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC)**
- **District Courts**
- **U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)**
- **Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI)**
- **Patent Examiners**

---

### Cost of Patents
- **Application Costs**: $5,000 to $15,000 per application.
- **Litigation Costs**: A simple patent infringement lawsuit can cost at least $500,000.
- **Example**: RIM v. NTP - Settlement: $612,500,000.

### Patentability in the U.S.
- **Utility**
- **Novelty**
- **Nonobviousness**
- **Enablement**
- **Patentable Subject Matter** [35 U.S.C. §101]

**Constitutional Basis:**
- **U.S. Constitution Art. I, §8(8)**: Promotes the progress of science and useful arts by securing exclusive rights to inventors for limited times.

**Patent Act 1952 [35 U.S.C. §101]**: Defines patentable subject matter.

**Subject Matter Eligibility**: A threshold test with exceptions (laws of nature, natural phenomena, abstract ideas).

**Adequate Written Description and Enablement** [35 USC §112]: Requires a clear and detailed description to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention.

**Novelty** [35 USC §102]: The invention must be new and differ from existing public information.

**Nonobviousness** [35 USC §103]: The invention should not be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.

### Example: Post-It® Notes
- **Innovation**: Scientists at 3M combined a seemingly useless adhesive with note-sized paper to create Post-It® notes.
- **Success**: Became a worldwide commercial success, demonstrating the value of nonobvious innovations.

### Conclusion
This talk has provided an overview of software patents, including the challenges and potential solutions. It has also highlighted the importance of understanding the complexities and nuances of patent law, especially in the context of software and business methods.
