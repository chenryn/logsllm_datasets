### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
Currently, the PowerShell tab opens by default, even when a single CMD tab is already open. This behavior can be inconvenient for users who primarily use CMD.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details
To address this, we propose allowing users to select their preferred default tab type (CMD or PowerShell). This will provide a more user-friendly experience, especially for those who prefer using CMD over PowerShell. Users should be able to configure this setting in the application's preferences or settings menu.
