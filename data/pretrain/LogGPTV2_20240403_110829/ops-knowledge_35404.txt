**Subject: Disabling RDP Access for the Domain Administrator Account**

We need to prevent the domain Administrator account from accessing a server directly via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Our policy requires logging in as a regular user and then using the "Run As Administrator" functionality. The server in question is running Windows Server 2012 R2 with Remote Desktop Session Host and Session-Based RD Collection. Despite the domain Administrator not being included in the allowed user groups, they are still able to log on.

### Solution:

To deny RDP access to a specific user or group, you can explicitly set the "Deny logon through Remote Desktop Services" privilege. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Open Group Policy Editor:**
   - If you are editing the local policy, open the Group Policy Editor by typing `gpedit.msc` in the Run dialog (Start | Run).
   - If you are editing a domain-level policy, open the appropriate Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) and edit the relevant policy.

2. **Navigate to User Rights Assignment:**
   - Go to `Computer Configuration | Windows Settings | Security Settings | Local Policies | User Rights Assignment`.

3. **Configure Deny Logon Through Remote Desktop Services:**
   - Find and double-click on "Deny logon through Remote Desktop Services."
   - Add the domain Administrator account or any other users/groups that you want to deny RDP access.
   - Click OK to save the changes.

4. **Apply the Policy:**
   - To apply the policy immediately, run the following command in the Command Prompt:
     ```shell
     gpupdate /force /target:computer
     ```
   - Alternatively, wait for the next scheduled policy refresh, which typically occurs every 90 minutes with a random offset of up to 30 minutes.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively deny RDP access to the domain Administrator account and ensure compliance with your security policy.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.

Thank you.
