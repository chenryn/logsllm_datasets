some exceptions to this rule. Therefore, in this Appendix we
investigate alternate models of local preference, and consider
how they impact the results we presented in Section 4; we are
currently in the process of extending this sensitivity analysis
to the results in Section 5-6.
K.1 An alternate model of local preference.
All our results thus far have used the following model of
local preference:
Local pref (LP): Prefer customer routes over peer routes.
Prefer peer routes over provider routes.
However, [18] also found some instances where ASes, es-
pecially content providers, prefer shorter peer routes over
longer customer routes. For this reason, we now investigate
the following model of local preference:
Local pref (LPk): Paths are ranked as follows:
• Customer routes of length 1.
• Peer routes of length 1.
• ...
• Customer routes of length k.
• Peer routes of length k.
• Customer paths of length > k.
• Peer paths of length > k.
• Provider paths.
Following the LPk step, we have the SP and TB steps as
in Section 2.2.1. As before, the security 1st model ranks
SecP above LPk, the security 2nd model ranks SecP be-
tween LPk and SP, and the security 3rd model ranks SecP
between SP and TB.
Remark. We will study this policy variant for various
values of k; note that letting k → ∞ is equivalent a rout-
ing policy where ASes equally prefer customer and provider
routes, as follows:
• Prefer peer and customer routes over provider routes.
• Prefer shorter routes over longer routes.
• Break ties in favor of customer routes.
• Use intradomain criteria (e.g., geographic location, de-
vice ID) to break ties among remaining routes.
K.2 Results with LP2 policy variant.
We start with an analysis of the LP2 policy variant; we are
in process of extending these results to other LPk variants.
Here, a peer route of length less than or equal to 2 hops is
preferred over a longer customer route.
Partitions.
In Figure 24 we show the partitions for
the LP2 policy variants, for the UCLA graph and for the
IXP augmented graph (cf., Figure 3 and Section 4.4). The
thick solid horizontal line shows the fraction of happy source
ASes in the baseline scenario (where no AS is secure). As
in Section 4.4, we ﬁnd that with security 3rd only limited
improved improvements in the metric HV,V (S) are possible,
relative to the baseline scenario HV,V (∅); 82 − 71 = 11%
for the UCLA AS graph, and 88 − 72 = 13% for the IXP
augmented graph, both of which are slightly less than what
we saw for our original LP model. In the security 2nd model,
we again see better improvements than security 3rd, but

not quite as much as we saw with our original LP model;
92 − 71 = 21% for the UCLA AS graph, and 94 − 72 = 22%
for the IXP augmented graph.
Interestingly, however, we
do see one diﬀerence between the UCLA AS graph and the
IXP augmented graph in this model; namely, we see more
immune ASes when security is 2nd for the IXP augmented
graph (41% vs. 55%). We discuss the observation in more
detail shortly.
Partitions by destination tier.
In Figure 25 we show
the partitions broken down by destination tier (see Table 1)
when security is 2nd and 3rd for the LP2 policy variants, for
the UCLA graph and for the IXP augmented graph (cf., Fig-
ure 4, Figure 5 and Section 4.5). The thick solid horizontal
line shows the fraction of happy source ASes in the baseline
scenario (where no AS is secure) for each destination tier.
While in Section 4.5 we found that most destination tiers
have roughly the same number of protectable ASes here we
see slightly diﬀerent trends.
1. Most of the protectable nodes are at stub and SMDG
(low-degree non-stub ASes) destinations. The higher-degree
AS destinations, i.e., Tier 2s, Tier 2s, and CPs, have very
few protectable ASes but many more immune ASes as com-
pared to the results we obtained for our original LP model
in Figure 4. This is even more apparent for the IXP aug-
