### Exceptions to the Local Preference Rule

In this appendix, we explore alternative models of local preference and their impact on the results presented in Section 4. We are also in the process of extending this sensitivity analysis to the results in Sections 5 and 6.

#### K.1 An Alternative Model of Local Preference

To date, our results have been based on the following model of local preference:

**Local Preference (LP):**
- Prefer customer routes over peer routes.
- Prefer peer routes over provider routes.

However, [18] identified instances where Autonomous Systems (ASes), particularly content providers, prefer shorter peer routes over longer customer routes. To account for this, we now investigate an alternative model of local preference, denoted as **LPk**:

**Local Preference (LPk):**
- Rank paths as follows:
  - Customer routes of length 1.
  - Peer routes of length 1.
  - ...
  - Customer routes of length k.
  - Peer routes of length k.
  - Customer routes of length > k.
  - Peer routes of length > k.
  - Provider routes.

Following the LPk step, we apply the Shortest Path (SP) and Tie-Breaking (TB) steps as described in Section 2.2.1. The security 1st model ranks Security Policy (SecP) above LPk, the security 2nd model ranks SecP between LPk and SP, and the security 3rd model ranks SecP between SP and TB.

**Remark:**
We will study this policy variant for various values of k. Notably, letting k → ∞ is equivalent to a routing policy where ASes equally prefer customer and provider routes, with the following preferences:
- Prefer peer and customer routes over provider routes.
- Prefer shorter routes over longer routes.
- Break ties in favor of customer routes.
- Use intradomain criteria (e.g., geographic location, device ID) to break ties among remaining routes.

#### K.2 Results with the LP2 Policy Variant

We begin by analyzing the LP2 policy variant, and we are in the process of extending these results to other LPk variants. In this variant, a peer route of length less than or equal to 2 hops is preferred over a longer customer route.

**Partitions:**

Figure 24 shows the partitions for the LP2 policy variants for the UCLA graph and the IXP augmented graph (refer to Figure 3 and Section 4.4). The thick solid horizontal line indicates the fraction of happy source ASes in the baseline scenario (where no AS is secure).

As in Section 4.4, we find that with the security 3rd model, only limited improvements in the metric HV,V(S) are possible relative to the baseline scenario HV,V(∅):
- 82% - 71% = 11% for the UCLA AS graph.
- 88% - 72% = 13% for the IXP augmented graph.

These improvements are slightly less than those observed for our original LP model. In the security 2nd model, we see better improvements than in the security 3rd model, but not quite as much as with our original LP model:
- 92% - 71% = 21% for the UCLA AS graph.
- 94% - 72% = 22% for the IXP augmented graph.

Interestingly, we observe a difference between the UCLA AS graph and the IXP augmented graph in this model. Specifically, there are more immune ASes when security is 2nd for the IXP augmented graph (41% vs. 55%). This observation will be discussed in more detail shortly.

**Partitions by Destination Tier:**

Figure 25 breaks down the partitions by destination tier (see Table 1) for the LP2 policy variants, for both the UCLA graph and the IXP augmented graph (refer to Figures 4 and 5, and Section 4.5). The thick solid horizontal line shows the fraction of happy source ASes in the baseline scenario for each destination tier.

While in Section 4.5, we found that most destination tiers had roughly the same number of protectable ASes, here we see slightly different trends:
1. Most of the protectable nodes are at stub and SMDG (low-degree non-stub ASes) destinations. Higher-degree AS destinations, such as Tier 2s and Content Providers (CPs), have very few protectable ASes but many more immune ASes compared to the results obtained for our original LP model in Figure 4. This trend is even more pronounced for the IXP augmented graph.
