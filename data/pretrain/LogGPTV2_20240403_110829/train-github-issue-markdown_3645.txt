## Issue Description
After multiple unsuccessful attempts to install the Java version of TensorFlow on my Windows machine, I decided to try the Python version. Below are the steps I followed and the error I encountered.

### System Information
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 64-bit
- **Graphics Card**: Intel HD Graphics

### Steps Taken
1. **Install Python**:
   - Downloaded and installed Python 3.6.6.
   - Added Python to the system PATH.
   - Verified the installation:
     ```sh
     C:\Users\Luke>python
     Python 3.6.6 (v3.6.6:4cf1f54eb7, Jun 27 2018, 03:37:03) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
     ```

2. **Install TensorFlow**:
   - Opened a Terminal window and ran the following command:
     ```sh
     C:\Windows\system32>cd
     C:>pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
     ```
   - The installation process downloaded and installed the required packages, including TensorFlow 1.8.0 and its dependencies.

3. **Add Scripts Directory to PATH**:
   - Added `C:\users\luke\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\Scripts` to the system PATH environment variable.

4. **Test TensorFlow Installation**:
   - Opened a new Terminal and ran the following commands:
     ```sh
     C:\Users\Luke>cd\
     C:>python
     Python 3.6.6 (v3.6.6:4cf1f54eb7, Jun 27 2018, 03:37:03) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
     >>> import tensorflow as tf
     ```

### Error Encountered
The following error occurred when trying to import TensorFlow:

```sh
Traceback (most recent call last):

    return importlib.import_module(mname)
  File "C:\Users\Luke\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\Lib\importlib__init__.py", line 126, in import_module

  File "", line 922, in create_module
  File "", line 219, in _call_with_frames_removed
ImportError: DLL load failed with error code -1073741795

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
...
Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime.
See https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources#common_installation_problems for some common reasons and solutions. Include the entire stack trace above this error message when asking for help.
```

### Additional Information
- The error code `-1073741795` does not match any of the listed error codes in the TensorFlow documentation.
- I followed the official TensorFlow installation guide for Windows: [Common Installation Problems](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows#Common_installation_problems)
