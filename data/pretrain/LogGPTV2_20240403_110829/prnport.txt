### prnport

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `prnport` command is a Visual Basic script located in the `%WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\` directory. It is used to create, delete, and list standard TCP/IP printer ports, as well as to display and change port configurations.

To use this command at a command prompt, type `cscript` followed by the full path to the `prnport` file, or change directories to the appropriate folder. For example:
```cmd
cscript %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnport
```

**Syntax:**
```cmd
cscript prnport {-a | -d | -l | -g | -t | -?} [-r <port_name>] [-s <computer_name>] [-u <username>] [-w <password>] [-o {raw | lpr}] [-h <ip_address>] [-q <queue_name>] [-n <port_number>] -m{e | d} [-i <community_name>] [-y <snmp_index>] -2{e | d}
```

**Parameters:**

- `-a`: Creates a standard TCP/IP printer port.
- `-d`: Deletes a standard TCP/IP printer port.
- `-l`: Lists all standard TCP/IP printer ports on the computer specified by the `-s` parameter.
- `-g`: Displays the configuration of a standard TCP/IP printer port.
- `-t`: Configures the port settings for a standard TCP/IP printer port.
- `-r <port_name>`: Specifies the port to which the printer is connected.
- `-s <computer_name>`: Specifies the name of the remote computer that hosts the printer you want to manage. If not specified, the local computer is used.
- `-u <username> -w <password>`: Specifies an account with permissions to connect to the computer that hosts the printer. All members of the target computer's local Administrators group have these permissions, but they can also be granted to other users. If not specified, you must be logged on under an account with these permissions for the command to work.
- `-o {raw | lpr}`: Specifies which protocol the port uses: TCP raw or TCP lpr. The TCP raw protocol is a higher performance protocol on Windows than the lpr protocol. If you use TCP raw, you can optionally specify the port number using the `-n` parameter. The default port number is 9100.
- `-h <ip_address>`: Specifies (by IP address) the printer for which you want to configure the port.
- `-q <queue_name>`: Specifies the queue name for a TCP raw port.
- `-n <port_number>`: Specifies the port number for a TCP raw port. The default port number is 9100.
- `-m{e | d}`: Specifies whether SNMP is enabled. The `e` parameter enables SNMP, and the `d` parameter disables SNMP.
- `-i <community_name>`: Specifies the SNMP community name if SNMP is enabled.
- `-y <snmp_index>`: Specifies the SNMP index.
- `-2{e | d}`: Specifies whether double spools (also known as respooling) are enabled for TCP lpr ports. Double spools are necessary because TCP lpr must include an accurate byte count in the control file sent to the printer, but the protocol cannot get the count from the local print provider. Therefore, when a file is spooled to a TCP lpr print queue, it is also spooled as a temporary file in the system32 directory. TCP lpr determines the size of the temporary file and sends the size to the server running LPD. The `e` parameter enables double spools, and the `d` parameter disables double spools.
- `/?`: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

1. To display all standard TCP/IP printing ports on the server \Server1:
   ```cmd
   cscript prnport -l -s Server1
   ```

2. To delete the standard TCP/IP printing port on the server \Server1 that connects to a network printer at 10.2.3.4:
   ```cmd
   cscript prnport -d -s Server1 -r IP_10.2.3.4
   ```

3. To add a standard TCP/IP printing port on the server \Server1 that connects to a network printer at 10.2.3.4 and uses the TCP raw protocol on port 9100:
   ```cmd
   cscript prnport -a -s Server1 -r IP_10.2.3.4 -h 10.2.3.4 -o raw -n 9100
   ```

4. To enable SNMP, specify the "public" community name, and set the SNMP index to 1 on a network printer at 10.2.3.4 shared by the server \Server1:
   ```cmd
   cscript prnport -t -s Server1 -r IP_10.2.3.4 -me -y public -i 1 -n 9100
   ```

5. To add a standard TCP/IP printing port on the local computer that connects to a network printer at 10.2.3.4 and automatically gets the device settings from the printer:
   ```cmd
   cscript prnport -a -r IP_10.2.3.4 -h 10.2.3.4
   ```
