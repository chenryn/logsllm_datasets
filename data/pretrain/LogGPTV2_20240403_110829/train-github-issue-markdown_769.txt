Usage of the withStyles()-function enforces setting the classes property.
TS doesn't seem to split `WithStyles` from `P`. This could be seen
as a typescript-fault, but I think it can easily be fixed within the type
definition.
    export default function withStyles(
      style: StyleRules | StyleRulesCallback,
      options?: WithStylesOptions,
    ): (
      component: React.ComponentType>,
    ) => React.ComponentType>;
One could replace
    (
      component: React.ComponentType>,
    ) => React.ComponentType>;
with
    import { Omit } from 'material-ui/index';
    >(
    component: React.ComponentType
    ) => React.ComponentType> & StyledComponentProps;
