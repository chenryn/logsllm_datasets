User: i want to build a site similar to www.omegle.com. can any one suggest me some ideas.
I think its built usning twisted , orbiter comet server.
Assistant: I'd suggest you use Twisted. ;) It has both chat clients and chat servers. Then you also need a web framework. I'd use either Grok or BFD, but there are many Python Web Frameworks around, and few of them are really bad.
