### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### Current Behavior
I have some global installed packages which I can't see in `npm -g ls`. I also
can't see them being outdated with `npm -g outdated`. These packages are
eslint, yarn, semver  
I tried to remove and re-install them(`npm -g remove eslint yarn semver && npm
-g i eslint yarn semver`) But no luck, they still won't appear in `npm -g ls`.
I also purged npm cache once before re-installation
### Expected Behavior
Update/View these packages like others
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. `npm -g ls`
  2. I have 20 packages in %appdata%\npm\node_modules but I only see 17
### Environment
  * OS: Windows 10 21H1
  * Node: 14.18.1
  * npm: 8.1.0
