So we can do something like this:
    COUCHDB_URL = 'https://mybigusername:PI:EMAIL/databasename/'
    s = requests.Session(url_prefix=COUCHDB_URL)
    r = s.get('/_all_docs', params=dict(include_docs=True))
    r = s.get('/some_document_id')
The example uses the CouchDB API and it would almost entirely prevent the need
for API wrappers like this (see it storing the url prefix right here). But
extensive usage of any REST API would benefit from this.
