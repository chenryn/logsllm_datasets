### Describe the problem
I can create an estimator either direct or from a keras model using the
initialisers:
    tf.estimator.estimator(
        model_fn,
        model_dir=None,
        config=None,
        params=None,
        warm_start_from=None
    )
    tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator(
        keras_model=None,
        keras_model_path=None,
        custom_objects=None,
        model_dir=None,
        config=None
    )
However with the keras approach there is no option to warm start the model
from a previously saved checkpoint. I am requesting a feature that makes it
possible to do this with a call such as:
    tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator(
        keras_model=None,
        keras_model_path=None,
        custom_objects=None,
        model_dir=None,
        config=None,
        warm_start_from=None
    )
Without this I cannot see how to start an estimator in a pre-trained state.
I have also tried to do this by just calling an untrained estimator to do
.predict which causes it to attempt to load from a checkpoint. When I provide
the checkpoint from previous estimator training I get an error as not all data
seems to be available. This is described in more detail at stackoverflow here
