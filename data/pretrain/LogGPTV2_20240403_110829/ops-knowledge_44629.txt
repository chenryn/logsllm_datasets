User: How to configure Apache server to support SSL secure connection?
Assistant: The following are the steps to configure the Apache server to support SSL secure connection: 1. Install the SSL certificate After purchasing the SSL certificate, you need to install the SSL certificate on the server. You can use the following commands to create an SSL directory and upload the certificate and key files into it: ``` mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl cp example.crt /etc/apache2/ssl/ cp example.key /etc/ apache2/ssl/ ``` Make sure you replace the example.crt and example.key file names with the names of the certificate and key files you purchased. 2. Enable mod_ssl module You need to enable Apache's mod_ssl module to support SSL secure connections. In the Apache configuration file, find the following line and uncomment it: ``` LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so ``` If you commented the above line in the file, remove the # sign. You can use vim or your favorite text editor to edit the Apache configuration file with the following command: ``` sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf ``` 3. Configuring virtual hosts Open the Apache configuration file and add the following lines To configure a virtual host for SSL connections: ``` <VirtualHost *:443> ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com ServerName example.com DocumentRoot /var/www/html <Directory "/var/www/html"> Options Indexes FollowSymLinks AllowOverride All Require all granted </Directory> SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/example.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/example.key </VirtualHost> ``` Make sure you replace example.com with your domain name, Replace /var/www/html with your document root, /etc/apache2/ssl/example.crt and /etc/apache2/ssl/example.key with the paths to your uploaded certificate and key files and name. 4. Restart Apache After making configuration changes, you need to restart Apache to apply the changes: ``` sudo systemctl restart httpd ``` Your Apache server is now configured to support SSL-secured connections. You can access your website using HTTPS from your browser.
