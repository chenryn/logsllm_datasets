### Title: BotConf 2018 - Mirai: Beyond the Aftermath

**Abstract:**

Two years have passed since the Mirai botnet wreaked havoc on high-profile targets. Since then, several significant developments have occurred. On the positive side, the individuals responsible for creating Mirai have been convicted. However, the release of the source code to the public has had negative consequences. On a more optimistic note, organizations have become more aware of the threat and have bolstered their defenses against potential future attacks.

The question now is: What comes after Mirai? Since the release of its source code, numerous individuals and groups have used, experimented with, and modified the original code for their own purposes. These so-called "Mirai copycats" are all vying for control over the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, competing to compromise as many vulnerable IoT devices as possible to build their own botnets and potentially become the next major player in this space.

This research focuses on three key technical aspects of the post-Mirai landscape:
1. **Variants and Modifications:** We will examine the significant modifications made to Mirai variants, including new techniques for infecting more IoT devices. These techniques include the use of an extensive set of factory default credentials, both known and unknown exploits, and targeting a broader range of device architectures.
2. **Genealogy of Variants:** We have identified over 100 Mirai variants so far, and we will present a detailed genealogy of these variants. This includes methods for automatically decrypting and extracting configurations to facilitate family identification and command-and-control (C2) extraction.
3. **Code Reuse by Other Botnets:** We will also explore whether other botnets have reused parts of Mirai's code. For example, we will analyze the Hide 'N Seek botnet and compare its modules and configuration encryption algorithm to those of Mirai.

Additionally, we will discuss how these variants monetize compromised IoT devices, such as by targeting cryptocurrency miners or using them as proxies. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we will compare and contrast the various Mirai variants to see how they relate to each other.

Finally, we will share key insights, findings, and lessons learned from our research. These insights can be valuable for researchers and security professionals in their threat intelligence efforts.
