scenario 1 adopts both LoS and NLoS component strategies
due to the feasibility and optimality considerations. Besides,
since antenna modes are randomly changed in scenario 2,
the CSI h is not exactly the same as Rayleigh distribution,
but it is somewhat close to Rayleigh. This is because in
the direction of the legitimate channel, the LoS part of CSI
may not exist under some antenna modes. In this case, the

CSI is mainly composed of its NLoS part which is caused
by multipath effects (of which the distribution is Rayleigh
distribution for indoor environment). To verify this, the
frequency histogram of CSI sequences and the probability
density curve of corresponding Rayleigh distribution in
scenario 2 for experiment 1 are illustrated in Fig. 7. The
factors mentioned above make the strategy in Sec. 4.2.2 may
no longer be optimal for RA, but we will show in Sec. 6.3.3
that it is still a better strategy when comparing with strategy
1 (which is similar to the attack model in [11]).
6.3.3 Evaluation of Cancellation Results
In this part, we ﬁrst implement cancellation with type III
attacker via the two strategies in Sec. 6.3.2, more speciﬁcally,
the attacker utilizes the spatial correlation between A-B and
A-C to get gx, then we process and relay gx in Matlab to
simulate the online attack in the stable C-B channel.
A. Experiment 1: Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show received signal
power encountering type III attacker in scenario 1 and 2
respectively. From Fig. 9 (a) and Fig. 10 (a), we can see that
strategy 2 performs better, which veriﬁes the effectiveness
of our optimal attack strategy. However, though strategy
2 achieves better cancellation performance in a traditional
wireless communication system,
it does not beneﬁt the
attacker in experiment 1 even if RA is used. In Fig. 12 (b),
when the transmitter is equipped with RA, the detection
probability after cancellation almost stay the same as before.
This is because the LoS component of CSI is changing
according to RA’s antenna state but not every antenna mode
(also the dynamic factors) in the direction of A-B and A-C
follows the relationship deﬁned by the calculated average
correlation coefﬁcient. For example, in Fig. 10 (b), for 198th
symbol, its power is −42.75dB and −63.99dB before and
after cancellation respectively, which indicates good cancel-
lation result. However, for 290th symbol, instead of reduc-
ing its power, the attacker’s cancellation strategy makes its
power increases from −71.07dB to −41.18dB. In this case,
the attacker weakens its own cancellation performance due
to the random change of antenna mode. In general, half of
the legitimate CSI follows the linear relationship deﬁned by
attacker’s strategy, however, the remaining CSI changes in

the opposite trend. Therefore, the overall detection proba-
bility does not change much.
Besides, from Fig. 12 (a), note that the type III attacker
who adopts strategy 1 (which is similar to the attacker
in [11]) even increases the detection probability in RA
scenarios. This is because different multipath caused by
diverse antenna patterns leads to phase changes of CSI,
and makes the position attacker chose no longer optimal.
To illustrate this, let Ahejθh and Agejθg denote the received
signal at the receiver and the attacker respectively. Thus,
the received signal after cancellation is: Ahejθh − Agejθg =
(Ahcos(θh)−Agcos(θg))+j(Ahsin(θh)−Agsin(θg)). There-
fore, the power of received signal changes from A2
h to
gcos(θh − θg). For an attacker, an effective

gcos(θh − θg)  Ag/Ah. In OA
scenario, since Ag ≈ Ah and θg ≈ θh, strategy 1 is effective.
However, in RA scenario, Ag, Ah, θg, θh are all changing
according to antenna mode, the above condition is not
always satisﬁed. In fact, experiment 1 is opposite to this
condition for the most of time, thus, strategy 1 weakens
attacker itself under the RA scenario.

For type II attack, we ﬁrst analyze the channel random-
ness and correlation. The magnitude and phase of the ﬁrst
500 symbols received by receiver and attacker in scenarios 1
and 2 are depicted in Fig. 8. Since the messages transmitted
in both scenarios are the same, the randomness of CSI is
equivalent to the randomness of received signal. As we can
see, the CSI in scenario 2 has a much higher randomness
than that in scenario 1. To verify this, we calculate the
auto-correlation coefﬁcient of legitimate CSI sequence and
show the result in Fig. 11 (a). We can observe that: 1) the
low auto-correlation coefﬁcient of CSI under RA (which is
about 0.15) indicates that except for reducing the correlation
between two spatial correlated channels, the utilization of
RA can also decrease the correlation within CSI sequence in
temporal domain; 2) due to the stable indoor environment,
the CSI sequence are highly correlated in both temporal and
spatial domains when OA is used.
Then we implement strategy 2 for type II attacker and
show its cancellation performance in Fig. 11 (b). Comparing
Fig. 11 (b) with Fig. 12 (b), we can see that the cancellation
performance for type II attacker and type III attacker is
similar. However, type III attack is much more practical.
Note that for Fig. 11 (b) and Fig. 12 (b), the detection
probability of type II attacker and type III attacker is almost
the same, however, the correlation coefﬁcient between h

and g for them is 0.0544 and 0.0262 respectively. When
threshold=−45dB and the transmitter is equipped with RA,
the detection probability under type II attack and type III
attack is 0.9399 and 0.9380 respectively. The result seems to
be counter-intuitive. In fact, this is because the correlation
coefﬁcient is too small so that the variance of CSI becomes
the main factor that affects the detection probability.
To show the inﬂuence of correlation coefﬁcient to energy
detection probability, we calculate the detection probability
for the ﬁrst case in Table 1 under strategy 2. We choose
this case because the correlation coefﬁcient between A-
B and A-C is 0.5615, which is relatively large compared
with other cases. In addition, since the auto-correlation of
legitimate CSI is 0.0606 in this case, the spatial correlation
coefﬁcient becomes the main factor that dominates the de-
tection probability. The results are listed in Table 3. As we
can see, the higher the correlation coefﬁcient is, the lower
the detection probability we get, which corresponds to our
previous simulation results in [1].
B. Experiment 2: Next, we implement type III attacker
for experiment 2 and show our results in Fig. 12 (c) and (d).
Comparing (a) with (c) and (b) with (d), we can see that the
cancellation results for OA are similar. However, when RA
is used, the attacker performs better in experiment 2, which
indicates the limitation of RA on randomizing wireless
channel. Note that the distance of Attacker-RX is the same
for both experiments, thus the angle between A-C and A-
B in experiment 2 is much smaller than that in experiment
1 due to the increase of the distance between TX and RX.
In this case, the antenna gains in the direction of RX and
attacker are almost the same, which means the attacker can
obtain a highly correlated CSI sequence. More speciﬁcally,
h = −30.9447dB, but
for experiment 1, rh¯g = 0.0262 and σ2
h = −37.1340dB in experiment 2. Thus,
rh¯g = 0.6723 and σ2
we can conclude that when the distance between TX and
RX increases, the guard zone at the receiver should increase
proportionally to guarantee the effectiveness of the channel
randomization approach.

6.4 Performance
Considering that CSI value under some antenna modes of
RA can be low, to ensure normal communications after
adopting RA, in this part we use the data of experiment
1 to analyze the performance of the message integrity
scheme we mentioned in Sec. 5.4. More speciﬁcally, we
ﬁrst calculate the number of symbols needed in an ON
slot from Theorem 5.1. Then we calculate the bit error rate
(BER) and link throughput of legitimate pairs under normal
communication scenarios with RA and OA respectively.
Before presenting the results, we ﬁrst show the deﬁnition
of BER and the calculation of link throughput.
6.4.1 BER
To clarify, the BER we mentioned here is referred as the
error that receiver cannot decode the message (that is, the
ON slot in message is canceled to the OFF slot), changing
OFF to ON does not happen because the noise is very small
in our experiments. So only OFF OFF slots are undecodable,
which is an error.
6.4.2 Link Throughput
If we only consider using the ON/OFF keying mode to carry
data, given the number of symbols n, the security require-
ment Ps and the BER p, we can derive the maximum link
. If we con-
throughput between A and B: c =
sider both normal mode and the hash ON/OFF encoding,
the maximum throughput will be c(cid:48) =
,
(cid:99)·∆t
where Ldata and Tdata are the bit length and transmission
time of a normal data packet respectively, while L is hash
length. We can see that the higher the per-symbol detec-
tion probability Pd, the lower the BER and the higher the
throughput.

6.4.3 Result
For simplicity, we evaluate the ON/OFF keying mode only.
As shown in Table 2, the symbol duration ∆t is 256µs. We
set the security requirement for successfully detecting each
ON slot to be Ps = 0.9999. Since the transmitter cannot tell
whether there exists the signal cancellation attack or not, to
guarantee detection probability, the transmitter always use
the detection probability of a single symbol under optimal
attack Pd (the same as detection probability in Fig. 10 with
cancellation) to calculate the number of symbols needed.
Then we calculate the BER and link throughput in normal
communications (without cancellation attack).

The results of the number of symbols, BER and link
throughput under RA and OA scenarios are shown in Table
4. We can have several observations: 1) As the threshold
α increases, the energy detection probability in each ON
slot decreases, which leads to an increasing number of
needed symbols and a decreasing link throughput, but the
system is more tolerant to noise/interference; 2) The BER
is lower when number of symbols is larger. Note that 1)
since the detection threshold is set based on the noise
level. The higher the noise level, the higher the threshold
should we use, which can decrease the false positive rate
for OFF slots. But the tradeoff is that this will decrease the
true positive probability (for ON slots) and also the link
throughput eventually; 2) the BER for OA scenarios is not
exact, because the large number of symbols needed in an
ON slot leads to enlarged length of CSI sequences, however,
the CSI sequence length in our experiment is 1000, which
is not long enough. The value of BER can be remedied by
measuring longer CSI sequences in the experiment.
6.5 Impact of Antenna Mode Selection
Here we use the data obtained in experiment 1 to simulate
the problem in Sec. 5.3. Since the channel is quite stable in
indoor environments, we assume the CSI under a speciﬁc
antenna mode stays the same in every measurement. Due to
the experimental limitations, we tested 2166 antenna modes
and corresponding CSI sequences. Based on the CSI we
obtained, we ﬁrst set some thresholds (β) for CSI magnitude
to get a CSI subset that has higher magnitudes (which is
equivalent to select antenna modes that lead to high CSI
magnitude). 1000 QPSK symbols are generated with Matlab
to simulate detection probability under the chosen antenna
modes with type III attack. To compare the inﬂuence of
antenna mode diversity and the threshold of CSI magnitude,
we simulate in two ways: a) M1: we cancel the whole CSI
directly; b) M2: we take the average CSI as LoS part and
implement cancellation after removing average CSI. Note
