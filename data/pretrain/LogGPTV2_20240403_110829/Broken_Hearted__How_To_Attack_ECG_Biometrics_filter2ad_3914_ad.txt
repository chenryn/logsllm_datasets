authentication process. Nevertheless, we can use the NCA
as an oracle by querying it with an ECG signal and recording
the response (i.e., an accept or a reject of the signal).
The main obstacle to such an extensive analysis is the time
needed to inject attack signals using a waveform generator or a
sound player. To overcome this limitation we devised another
kind of attack, called ofﬂine attack, which is instantiated by
directly interfacing with HeartID through the API calls of
the NCA (Nymi Band’s companion app). We implemented a
simple Android app that allows setting up previously stored
biometric templates and performing authentication for arbitrary
attack signals, at a rate of hundreds of signals per minute,
without requiring a waveform generator or Nymi Band. Our
devised Android app does not require physical ECG input, but
accepts biometric template and biometric samples in digital
form via a command line interface and forwards them to the
HeartID library. For every authentication attempt, the library’s
authentication decision is stored in a database by our Android
app for later analysis.
We remark, however, that the ﬁnal results of Section VI
are obtained online, i.e., using the actual Nymi Band.
The experiments below were performed on a selection of 8
subjects from the training set. For each experiment, subject and
device, we tested 20 randomly generated attack signals. We
recall that the synthetic ECG is generated by sampling features
from distributions, hence the reason of their randomness. The
reported success rate (SR) is the ratio between successful
authentications and total attempts. As expected, the enrolment
signals used to build the biometric templates yielded an SR of
100%.
Filtering. We evaluate the adequacy of our ECG ﬁltering
algorithm, which builds on a Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing
ﬁlter [17]. We applied the SG ﬁlter to the enrolment signals,
obtaining for them an SR of 100%. Stronger SG smoothing
parameters resulted in SRs below 63%. We also wanted to assess
how noise affects authentication chances. To this purpose, we
added to the ﬁltered signal white Gaussian noise with standard
deviation computed from the enrolment signal. These yielded
an SR of 100%, demonstrating that the ﬁltering method of
HeartID can equally support noisy and ﬁltered ECG data. Note
that the above experiments did not require the generation of
synthetic ECGs.
Synthetic signal generation. Here, we assess the ﬁt of our
synthetic ECG signals. To this purpose, we generated signals
drawing on the features detected in the enrolment ECGs, and
reproduced in the same order. These signals resulted in an
overall SR of 75%, with an SR of 100% for 5 out of 8 subjects.
To understand if HeartID is sensitive to all the ECG waves, we
further produce signals where one of the waves is systematically
suppressed by setting its amplitude to 0. For each wave kind, the
obtained SR was 0%, suggesting that all ECG waves are used
in the biometric template. In a variation of the ﬁrst experiment,
we test signals with symmetric waves, resulting in an SR drop
from 75% to 15%. This motivates our claim that asymmetric

TABLE II: Results of injecting the unmodiﬁed raw data.
”Combined” refers to the combination of all non-Nymi devices.
The tick marks signify users that were successfully attacked.
waves are needed in order to produce realistic and successful
attack signals. Finally, we report that subject-speciﬁc ECG
features are indeed central for authentication: signals generated
using default parameters from literature [4] produced an SR of
0%.
Statistical distance. Now that we have proved the adequacy
of the ﬁltering and synthetic signal generation algorithms,
the next step is evaluating the mapping function. In this
experiment we want to assess how different statistical distances
in the optimisation problem of Section V-A affect the success
rate. Here, we restrict to one-2-one mappings, i.e., mappings
estimated over data from a single subject. In contrast to the
default mappings, one-2-one mappings are tailored to the
subject, meaning that the resulting attack signal better mimics
the target ECG. However, these cannot be used to instantiate
an attack, since they require the victim’s enrolment signal. We
compare the previously introduced L2 distance with the χ2
