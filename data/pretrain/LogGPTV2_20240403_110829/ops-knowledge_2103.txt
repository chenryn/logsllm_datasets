User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题0x19 KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED in my event log So I have a server, and every time a user or service account logs on to the machine, an error event is generated in the System log:

A Kerberos Error Message was received:
 on logon session DOMAIN\serviceaccount
 Client Time: 
 Server Time: 12:44:21.0000 10/9/2012 Z
 Error Code: 0x19 KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED
 Extended Error: 
 Client Realm: 
 Client Name: 
 Server Realm: DOMAIN
 Server Name: krbtgt/DOMAIN
 Target Name: krbtgt/DOMAIN@DOMAIN
 Error Text: 
 File: e
 Line: 9fe
 Error Data is in record data.


So of course I Googled this, and the only information I'm getting for it is that "it doesn't necessarily indicate a problem and you can usually ignore it."

Well, gee, that's great, but these errors are spamming my System log about once a minute and I'd really like to make them stop. Any ideas?

From the Microsoft AskDS blog:


  KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED 
  
  If you see this error in the trace, it does not indicate there is a
  problem at all. The client requested a ticket but did not include the
  pre-authentication data with it. You will typically see the same
  request sent again with the data and the domain controller issuing the
  ticket. Windows uses this technique to determine the supported
  encryption types.

Assistant: I can't help you stop them; I'm afraid I'm a Linux person.  I can at least explain them.  Understanding this message requires a bit of a digression into how Kerberos authentication works.

The basic Kerberos authentication process is for the client to request an encrypted TGT from the KDC, which it then decrypts with its local key.  However, naively implemented, this allows an attacker to download the TGTs for every user in your realm and then try to decrypt them via brute force attacks at the attacker's leisure.  Kerberos therefore added a mechanism called preauthentication.

The way preauthentication works is that the KDC, when it receives the TGT request, sends back a preauthentication challenge rather than just sending back the TGT.  The preauthentication challenge can take various forms, but the most common asks for the client to send the current time encrypted in the client's key.  The KDC then confirms the client can do that (which indicates some knowledge of the client key) before sending the TGT.

However, in part because preauthentication was added on and in part because the client doesn't know what preauthentication challenge will be sent, the client always sends the basic TGT request and the KDC then always rejects it with a preauthentication challenge.  Those log messages are Active Directory logging the fact that it got a TGT request without preauthentication and sent back a challenge.

Your guess is as good as mine on why it bothers to log this, since it's a normal part of the protocol and not horribly interesting, but all the Linux-based KDCs do the same thing.
