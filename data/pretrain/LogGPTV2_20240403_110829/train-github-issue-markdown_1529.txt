##### Detailed description
Since at least version 3.3.1, the EVENT_MOUSEWHEEL and EVENT_MOUSEHWHEEL have
worked in linux despite the fact the the .h file says they are implemented in
Windows Only.
With 4.5.4 on a new machine, the MOUSEWHEEL events do not work.
I went back to 4.5.1 and they work fine.
