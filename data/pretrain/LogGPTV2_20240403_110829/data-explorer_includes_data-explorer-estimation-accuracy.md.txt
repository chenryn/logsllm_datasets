This function uses a variant of the [HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog),
which does a stochastic estimation of set cardinality. The algorithm provides a "knob" that can be used to balance accuracy and execution time per memory size:
|Accuracy|Error (%)|Entry count   |
|--------|---------|--------------|
|       0|      1.6|212|
|       1|      0.8|214|
|       2|      0.4|216|
|       3|     0.28|217|
|       4|      0.2|218|
> [!NOTE]
> The "entry count" column is the number of 1-byte counters in the HLL implementation.
The algorithm includes some provisions for doing a perfect count (zero error), if the set cardinality is small enough:
* When the accuracy level is `1`, 1000 values are returned
* When the accuracy level is `2`, 8000 values are returned
The error bound is probabilistic, not a theoretical bound. The value is the standard deviation of error distribution (the sigma), and 99.7% of the estimations will have a relative error of under 3 x sigma.
The following image shows the probability distribution function of the relative
estimation error, in percentages, for all supported accuracy settings:
