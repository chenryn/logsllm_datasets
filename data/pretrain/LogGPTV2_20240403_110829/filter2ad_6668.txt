ABSTRACT
The human element is often considered the weakest element
in security. Although many kinds of humans interact with
systems that are designed to be secure, one particular type
of human is especially important, the security information
worker. Security information workers include software de-
velopers, system administrators, and intelligence analysts.
This workshop aims to develop and stimulate discussion
about security information workers.

INTRODUCTION
The human element is often considered the weakest ele-
ment in security. Although many kinds of humans interact
with systems that are designed to be secure, one particular
type of human is especially important, the security informa-
tion worker. Security information workers include:
Software developers, who design and build software that
manages and protects sensitive information;
System administrators, who deploy and manage security-
sensitive software and hardware systems; and
Intelligence analysts, who collect and analyze data about
security matters to understand information and make
predictions.
This workshop aims to develop and stimulate discussion
about security information workers. We will consider pa-
pers including, but not limited to:
• Empirical studies of security information workers, in-
cluding experiments, ﬁeld studies, and surveys;
• New tools designed to assist security information work-
ers;
• Infrastructure for better understanding security infor-
mation workers;
• Techniques designed to help security information work-
ers do their jobs;
• Evaluations of tools and techniques for security infor-
mation workers.
Much security research could be considered about secu-
rity information workers; for instance, tools that automat-
ically ﬁnd defects in program code could be construed to
help software developers. However, successful submissions
to this workshop will explicitly be informed by an under-
standing of how security information workers do their jobs,
and the results will explicitly address how we understand
security information workers.
