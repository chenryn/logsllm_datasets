**Abstract:**
The human element is often considered the weakest link in security. While many types of individuals interact with secure systems, one specific group is particularly critical: security information workers. This group includes software developers, system administrators, and intelligence analysts. The primary goal of this workshop is to foster and stimulate discussion about the roles and challenges faced by security information workers.

**Categories and Subject Descriptors:**
- K.6.5 [Security and Protection]: Authentication, Unauthorized access (e.g., hacking, phreaking), Invasive software (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses)
- H.5.3 [Group and Organization Interfaces]: Computer-supported cooperative work

**General Terms:**
- Security, Human Factors, Experimentation, Management

**1. Introduction:**
The human element is often considered the weakest link in security. While various individuals interact with secure systems, a specific group is particularly crucial: security information workers. This group includes:
- Software developers, who design and build software to manage and protect sensitive information;
- System administrators, who deploy and manage security-sensitive software and hardware systems; and
- Intelligence analysts, who collect and analyze data related to security matters to understand information and make predictions.

This workshop aims to develop and stimulate discussion about security information workers. We will consider papers including, but not limited to:
- Empirical studies of security information workers, such as experiments, field studies, and surveys;
- New tools designed to assist security information workers;
- Infrastructure for better understanding security information workers;
- Techniques designed to help security information workers perform their jobs more effectively;
- Evaluations of tools and techniques for security information workers.

While much security research can be relevant to security information workers (e.g., tools that automatically find defects in program code can help software developers), successful submissions to this workshop will explicitly draw from an understanding of how security information workers do their jobs, and the results will explicitly address how we understand these workers.
