Abstract—We introduce SCiFI, a system for Secure Com-
putation of Face Identiﬁcation. The system performs face
identiﬁcation which compares faces of subjects with a database
of registered faces. The identiﬁcation is done in a secure
way which protects both the privacy of the subjects and the
conﬁdentiality of the database. A speciﬁc application of SCiFI
is reducing the privacy impact of camera based surveillance.
In that scenario, SCiFI would be used in a setting which
contains a server which has a set of faces of suspects, and
client machines which might be cameras acquiring images in
public places. The system runs a secure computation of a face
recognition algorithm, which identiﬁes if an image acquired by
a client matches one of the suspects, but otherwise reveals no
information to neither of the parties.
Our work includes multiple contributions in different areas:
• A new face identiﬁcation algorithm which is unique in
having been speciﬁcally designed for usage in secure
computation. Nonetheless, the algorithm has face recog-
nition performance comparable to that of state of the art
algorithms. We ran experiments which show the algorithm
to be robust to different viewing conditions, such as
illumination, occlusions, and changes in appearance (like
wearing glasses).
• A secure protocol for computing the new face recognition
algorithm. In addition, since our goal is to run an actual
system, considerable effort was made to optimize the
protocol and minimize its online latency.
• A system – SCiFI, which implements a secure computation
of the face identiﬁcation protocol.
• Experiments which show that the entire system can run in
near real-time: The secure computation protocol performs
a preprocessing of all public-key cryptographic opera-
tions. Its online performance therefore mainly depends
on the speed of data communication, and our experiments
show it to be extremely efﬁcient.

I. INTRODUCTION
Video and camera based surveillance is very common,
and is found to be useful for ﬁghting crime. On the other
hand, the ubiquity of such surveillance is a major concern
for the public, that feels that its privacy is being violated.
Our work focuses on face recognition systems, which can
automatically identify if some known suspects appear in
a large set of images. Such systems can be useful, for
example, for automatically searching for suspects in a stream
of images coming from public places. On the other hand,

these systems can be misused to track people regardless
of suspicion, and a rogue operator can even combine data
from these systems with a universal database linking faces
to identities, such as a database of drivers’ license photos.
A simple solution to the privacy concern might be to
provide each camera with the list of images of suspects,
perform the identiﬁcation task locally at the camera, and
report to the operator only in the rare cases where a match
is found. This solution might not be acceptable, though, if
the list of suspects is conﬁdential, as is often the case. There
is therefore a need for a solution which protects both the
privacy of the public and the conﬁdentiality of the data held
by authorities.
We developed the SCiFI system which matches images
taken by a client camera to a list of images (of potential
suspects) which are held by a server. Face identiﬁcation
in SCiFI is based on a novel face recognition algorithm
that performs very well in terms of applicability to real-
life images and robustness to unseen conditions (e.g., dif-
ferent illumination conditions). The matching is done in a
privacy preserving way, using efﬁcient methods of secure
computation, and does not reveal any information to the
parties, except for whether a match was found. Furthermore,
to further protect the database of suspects it is possible
to distribute the operation of the server to run on several
machines, such that each of these machines knows only part
of each suspect’s face. ( The details of a system utilizing
this distributed approach are given in the full version of the
paper.)
System overview: SCiFI is composed of two major
components, a server, which stores a set of face represen-
tations of subjects from a conﬁdential list, and a client,
whose input is a single face. In a typical setting the server
might have a list of faces of suspected persons, while the
client might be a camera which takes photos of passersby.1
The system must ﬁnd out if the face held by the client
matches any of the faces in the server’s list. The system
must also satisfy two other requirements: (1) As with any
biometric data, it is unlikely that there will be an exact match
between the image acquired by the client and the image of
the same person that exists in the list. Therefore a fuzzy face
1We assume that the recognition module of the client receives images
of faces preprocessed for face recognition. We do not discuss in this paper
methods for face detection or localization that perform this preprocessing.
See, e.g., [1], [2] for related work.
identiﬁcation algorithm must be used. (2) The matching must
be done in a privacy preserving manner. Namely, the server
and client must not learn any information except for whether
there is a match between the client’s input and a face in the
server’s list.
Achieving this goal required designing a new face recog-
nition algorithm which has very good performance in terms
of the robustness of recognition, and can also support secure
computation protocols. (The main challenge in this respect
is that face recognition algorithms typically use data repre-
sentations over the Real numbers, whereas secure protocols
operate over ﬁnite ﬁelds, and a simple conversion of existing
face recognition methods to ﬁnite ﬁelds results in degra-
dation of recognition.) We also designed secure protocols,
based on homomorphic encryption and oblivious transfer,
computing the face recognition algorithm. We conducted
experiments showing the accuracy of the face recognition
algorithm and the nearly real-time performance of the secure
protocols.
Face Recognition and Privacy: Face recognition is an
inexpensive and non-intrusive technique, and its usage for
user veriﬁcation is more convenient than using passwords,
hardware devices, or other biometric identiﬁcation methods.
Thus previous research in incorporating face technology
with security focused on the veriﬁcation task [3], where the
user identiﬁes himself to the system and the system veriﬁes
his identity by comparing the current image of his face
with a representation of his face stored in the system. Such
applications assume a controlled environment, rely on user’s
cooperation, and usually use several images of a person
under controlled conditions in the registration phase.
We address a different recognition task, denoted in the
face recognition literature as identiﬁcation. This is a one-
to-many recognition task where a single image is compared
with a list of stored images. This task is more useful in
surveillance applications, like the detection of criminals or
terrorists in public places, or a search for a missing person.
It has several distinguishing characteristics which make it
much harder to implement than the veriﬁcation task:
• The registration of persons into the system is based
on very few images of them (usually a single image
per person) which might have been taken without
the person’s cooperation, under arbitrary conditions of
illumination and pose, and might be of poor quality.
• The recognition routine is also different: Given a novel
image of a face under arbitrary, and not necessarily
ideal, viewing conditions, the system must recognize if
this is an image of one of the individuals stored in the
system or otherwise reject it.
In addition, unlike the one-to-one veriﬁcation task, the one-
to-many identiﬁcation task, which is done without the sub-
ject’s cooperation, must be robust to different changes that
are likely to occur between the original picture stored in the
database, and the image taken by the client camera. These

– illumination direction and glasses on/off, bottom row –
three subjects with variation in pose, lighting, and facial
expression
can include, for example, changes in illumination, i.e. in
the amount and direction of light; changes in the viewpoint
of the camera, and in the pose of the subject; different
occlusions which hide parts of the subject’s face; difference
in facial expressions; and changes in local appearance due
to facial hair, makeup, glasses, etc., which might be used by
the suspect to avoid being identiﬁed.
Figure 1 describes some examples of variation in test
images. These images are taken from the FERET [4] and
PIE [5] databases of images that we use in order to test the
recognition performance of SCiFI.
Face recognition algorithms and identiﬁcation: As with
any biometric data, two images of the same person are
never identical. On the other hand, authentication based
on passwords or cryptographic keys always expects the
user to enter the same password or use the same key.
Representations used in recognition must be designed to
produce the same results for similar, but not necessarily
identical, inputs. In cryptographic algorithms only identical
inputs enable successful authentication, and therefore they
cannot be applied to biometric recognition. (To bridge this
gap, there have been attempts in cryptography to develop
noise resistant one-way hash functions [6], [7], [8]. These
are discussed in Section I-A.)
The novel algorithm that we use in SCiFI performs well
in the one-to-many identiﬁcation task since it can generalize
to unseen conditions. There are other face recognition algo-
rithms which are robust to changes in the environment in
which photos are taken. The algorithm of SCiFI is unique,
however, in that it lends itself easily to secure computa-
tion, which is inherently based on the usage of discrete
mathematics. Other effective face recognition algorithms
employ continuous face representations which are compared
by complex measures of similarity that in some cases are not
even metric. Such representations are not easily supported
by cryptographic algorithms. A naive conversion from the
continuous comparison methods used in face recognition to a
discrete measure, using, e.g., simple quantization, affects the
accuracy of recognition, and result in degraded performance.
This issue is elaborated in more detail in Section I-A.
An overview of the face representation used in SCiFI:
We propose and use an index-based face representation that
was speciﬁcally designed for usage with secure computation.
The representation is based on only a single known image
per person. It is robust to illumination changes, occlusions,
shadows, highlights, and local changes in appearance (such
as wearing glasses). We do not address pose in this paper,
but in principle the face representation can be extended to
variation in pose.
• As is demonstrated by our experiments, the SCiFI sys-
tem uses a face identiﬁcation algorithm which provides
results that are comparable to the state-of-the-art in
illumination invariant face recognition, and achieves
The representation is based on the idea of facial composite
(aka photo-robot), where a face is formed as a collection
of fragments taken from vocabularies of facial features. (A
similar system is typically used by police departments to
record eyewitness’s memory of a face.) The vocabularies
of facial features contain typical appearances of facial frag-
ments obtained from a set of people unrelated to the face
that should be reconstructed. (To exemplify and simplify the
system, assume that the vocabulary contains a set of typical
images for each facial component, such as the nose, eyes,
eyebrows, etc.) Choosing the best match for each part and
placing those parts in the spatial conﬁguration similar to
the sought face is likely to produce an output close to the
original face. The reconstruction process is very fast, and
although the result will not be photo-realistic, it can still
sufﬁce for recognition.
In SCiFI we use more parts than are commonly used
by humans, and they do not necessarily correspond to the
semantic parts of a face. We propose to represent a face
by a vector which is composed of (1) indices into part
vocabularies, and of (2) quantized relative distances of the
parts to the center of the face. We assign to each part a
set of words from the corresponding vocabulary, instead of
a single match. (E.g., the nose might be represented by the
indices of the four noses from the vocabulary which are most
similar to it. Such ﬂexibility in the representation makes
it robust to image conditions and local noises.) Any two
representations are essentially sets that can be compared by
a secure computation of their set difference.
The face recognition part is very fast, it does not require
dense correspondence between the input and database faces
(but rather only 3-5 points for initial alignment of faces),
and it does not use 3D models or any extensive training.
The secure computation of this algorithm has a relatively
small overhead, which means that it can be deployed in real
systems.
Our contributions: The SCiFI system is the ﬁrst secure
face identiﬁcation system that is suited for real-life applica-
tions. The advantages of SCiFI over existing identiﬁcation
methods can be summarized as follows:
very good robustness to occlusions. The algorithm can
be based on computing the Hamming distance, and is
therefore a natural candidate for secure computation.
The results are superior to those of the Eigenfaces
algorithm which, to our knowledge, is the only other
face recognition algorithm for which secure computa-
tion was applied.
• SCiFI uses efﬁcient secure computation techniques to
identify, without leaking any other information, whether
a given image is in a suspects list.
• We implemented the complete SCiFI system. This
implementation computes the face representation at the
client and then runs a secure computation with the
server. We ran experiments of both the accuracy of
face identiﬁcation, and of the performance timings of
the entire system (including communication between
the parties). Even though we implemented the cryp-
tographic part in Java, its performance is remarkably
fast, thanks in part for optimizations which perform
a precomputation of computation intensive tasks, and
enable near real-time identiﬁcation of suspects.
Another attractive property of SCiFI is that face identiﬁ-
cation is done through an interactive protocol which reveals
to the client an upper bound on the number of items in the
server’s database, and therefore the client can be assured
that the server does not use the system for large scale image
identiﬁcation (e.g., for comparing the client’s input with
images of all people who have a criminal record). Another
advantage is that the server cannot store the client’s input
for future use. This prevents the server from, say, comparing
those who pass by the client’s camera today to suspects
