## Abstract
We introduce SCiFI, a system for Secure Computation of Face Identification. SCiFI performs face identification by comparing subjects' faces with a database of registered faces, ensuring both the privacy of the subjects and the confidentiality of the database. One specific application of SCiFI is to reduce the privacy impact of camera-based surveillance. In this scenario, SCiFI operates in a setting with a server that holds a set of suspect faces and client machines (e.g., cameras) that capture images in public places. The system securely computes a face recognition algorithm to determine if an image acquired by a client matches one of the suspects, without revealing any additional information to either party.

Our work makes several contributions:
- **New Face Identification Algorithm**: We developed a novel face identification algorithm specifically designed for secure computation, which maintains performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate its robustness to various conditions, such as illumination, occlusions, and changes in appearance.
- **Secure Protocol**: We designed a secure protocol for computing the new face recognition algorithm, optimizing it for minimal online latency.
- **System Implementation**: We implemented SCiFI, a system that securely computes the face identification protocol.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Experiments show that SCiFI can run in near real-time, with efficient preprocessing of all public-key cryptographic operations, making the online performance primarily dependent on data communication speed.

**Keywords**: Secure computation, face recognition, privacy.

## 1. Introduction
Video and camera-based surveillance is prevalent and useful for crime prevention. However, the widespread use of such surveillance raises significant privacy concerns. Our work focuses on face recognition systems that can automatically identify known suspects in a large set of images. While these systems are valuable for identifying suspects, they can also be misused to track individuals regardless of suspicion, and a rogue operator could combine data from these systems with a universal identity database.

A simple solution might be to provide each camera with a list of suspect images and perform local identification, reporting only when a match is found. However, this approach is not acceptable if the list of suspects is confidential. Therefore, there is a need for a solution that protects both the privacy of the public and the confidentiality of the data held by authorities.

We developed SCiFI, a system that matches images taken by a client camera to a list of potential suspect images held by a server. SCiFI uses a novel face recognition algorithm that performs well in real-life conditions and is robust to unseen conditions. The matching is done using secure computation methods, ensuring that no information is revealed except whether a match was found. Additionally, the server's operation can be distributed across multiple machines, each holding only part of each suspect's face, further protecting the database.

### System Overview
SCiFI consists of two main components:
- **Server**: Stores a set of face representations from a confidential list.
- **Client**: Inputs a single face image, typically from a camera capturing passersby.

The system must determine if the client's face matches any in the server's list while preserving privacy. This requires a fuzzy face identification algorithm and secure computation protocols. We designed a new face recognition algorithm with good robustness and support for secure computation. We also developed secure protocols based on homomorphic encryption and oblivious transfer, and conducted experiments demonstrating the accuracy and near real-time performance of the system.

### Face Recognition and Privacy
Face recognition is non-intrusive and convenient for user verification. Previous research has focused on the verification task, where the user identifies themselves, and the system verifies their identity using a stored representation. This typically assumes a controlled environment and user cooperation.

We address the identification task, where a single image is compared to a list of stored images. This task is more challenging due to:
- Few and potentially poor-quality images for registration.
- Arbitrary viewing conditions for the test image.
- Robustness to changes in illumination, pose, occlusions, and facial expressions.

### Face Representation in SCiFI
We propose an index-based face representation designed for secure computation. This representation is based on a single known image per person and is robust to illumination changes, occlusions, and local appearance changes. The representation is inspired by facial composites, where a face is formed from fragments of typical facial features. We represent a face as a vector of indices into part vocabularies and quantized relative distances to the face center. This allows for robust comparison using secure computation of set differences.

### Contributions
- **Robust Algorithm**: SCiFI uses a new face recognition algorithm with excellent robustness to occlusions and other variations.
- **Secure Computation**: SCiFI employs efficient secure computation techniques to identify suspects without leaking additional information.
- **Complete System**: We implemented the entire SCiFI system, including face representation at the client and secure computation with the server. Experiments show high accuracy and near real-time performance.
- **Privacy Protection**: The interactive protocol reveals only an upper bound on the number of items in the server's database, ensuring the server does not use the system for large-scale image identification.

SCiFI is the first secure face identification system suitable for real-life applications, offering superior performance and robust privacy protection.
