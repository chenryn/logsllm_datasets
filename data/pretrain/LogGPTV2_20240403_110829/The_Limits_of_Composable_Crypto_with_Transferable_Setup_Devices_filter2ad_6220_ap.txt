A Issue with Over Extraction in Oblivious Transfer Combiners [GIS+10]
In the following we identify an issue that affects one of the feasibility results in [GIS+10, Section 5]. More
precisely, this result establishes that UC security for general functionalities is feasible in the tamper-proof
hardware model in O((cid:20))-round assuming only OWFs (or O(1)-round based on CRHFs) based on stateless
tokens. The issue arises as a result of over extraction where a fully-secure OT protocol is constructed from
a weaker variant and the simulation extracts values for sender’s inputs even on certain executions where the
receiver aborts. The term over extraction has been studied before in the context of commitment schemes
where a scheme with over extraction is constructed as an intermediate step towards achieving full security
[PW09, GLOV12].
On a high-level, in the work of [GIS+10], they ﬁrst construct an OT protocol with milder security
guarantees. More precisely, a QuasiOT protocol achieves UC-security against a malicious receiver and
straight-line extraction against malicious sender. However, the scheme is not fully secure as a malicious
sender can cause an input-dependent abort for an honest receiver. Towards amplifying the security, [GIS+10]
consider the following protocol:
∑
∑
receiver computes its output as s
′
2. If the ﬁrst step completes, the sender sends (s
0 = s0+
1. The sender with input (s0; s1) and receiver with input b interact in n executions of QuasiOTs. The
sender picks z1; : : : ; zn and ∆ at random and sets the inputs to the ith QuasiOT instance as (zi; zi+∆).
The receiver on the other hand chooses bits b1; : : : ; bn at random subject to the sum being its input b.
i zi+∆) to the receiver. The
i wi where wi is the output of the receiver in the ith QuasiOT.
This protocol remains secure against a malicious receiver. However, an issue arises with a malicious
sender. To simulate a malicious sender in this protocol, [GIS+10] rely on the straight-line extractor of the n
QuasiOTs by sampling two sets of random (b1; : : : ; bn), one set summing up to 0 and another set summing
up to 1 and computing what the receiver outputs in the two cases. As we demonstrate below such a strategy
leads to failure in the simulation. More precisely, consider the following malicious sender strategy.
′
1 = s1+
i zi; s
∑
′
b +
(cid:15) Pick z1; z2; :::; zn(cid:0)1 and ∆ at random.
(cid:15) The inputs of the ﬁrst n (cid:0) 1 tokens are set to z1; z1 + ∆; : : : ; zn(cid:0)1; zn(cid:0)1 + ∆.
(cid:15) Let z1 + : : : + zn(cid:0)1 = a and z1 + : : : + zn(cid:0)1 + ∆ = b.
(cid:15) The inputs to the n-th token are some ﬁxed values c (when bn = 0) and d (when bn = 1), where
c + d ̸= ∆.
Next, the sender modiﬁes the code of the tokens used in the QuasiOT protocol so that the ﬁrst n (cid:0) 1
QuasiOTs never abort. The n-th instantiations however is made to abort whenever the input bn, the receiver’s
input is 1. Let s0 = 0 and s1 = 1 (we remark that we are not concerned about the actual inputs of the sender,
but focus on what the receiver learns). We next examine the honest receiver’s output in both the real and
ideal worlds. First, in the real world the honest receiver learns an output only if bn = 0 (since the n-th token
aborts whenever bn = 1). We consider two cases:
Case 1: The receiver’s input is b = 0. Then bn = 0 with probability 1=2, and bn = 1 with probability 1=2.
Moreover, when bn = 0, the sum of the outputs obtained by the receiver is a + c. This is because
when bn = 0, then, b1 + : : : + bn(cid:0)1 = 0, and the receiver learns a as the sum of the outputs in the
the ﬁrst n (cid:0) 1 QuasiOTs and c from the n-th QuasiOT. On the other hand, if bn = 1 then the receiver
aborts in the n-th QuasiOT and therefore aborts.
61
Case 2: The receiver’s input is b = 1. Similarly, in this case the receiver will learn b + c with probability
1=2 and aborts with probability 1=2.
In the ideal world, the simulator runs ﬁrst with a random bit-vector and extracts its inputs in the QuasiOTs
′
by monitoring the queries to the corresponding PRF tokens. Next, it generates two bit-vectors bi’s and b
i’s
that add up to 0 and 1, respectively, and computes the sums of the sender’s input that correspond to these
bits. Then the distribution of these sums can be computed as follows:
∑
∑
Case 1: In case that
bi = 0, then bn = 0 with probability 1=2, and bn = 1 with probability 1=2. In the
former case the receiver learns a + c, whereas in the latter case it learns b + d.
Case 2: In case that
′
′
i = 1, then with probability 1=2, b
n = 0 and with probability 1=2, b
b
′
n = 1. In the
former case the receiver learns b + c, whereas in the latter it learns a + d.
Note that this distribution is different from the real distribution, where the receiver never learns b + d or
a + d since the token will always abort and not reveal d. We remark that in our example the abort probability
of the receiver is independent of its input as proven in Claim 17 in [GIS+10], yet the distribution of what it
learns is different.
On a more general note, our attack presents the subtleties that need to be addressed with the “selec-
tive” abort strategy. Recent works by Ciampi et al. [COSV16a, COSV16b] have identiﬁed subtleties in
recent construction of non-malleable commitments [GRRV14] where selective aborts were not completely
addressed.
