is due to the stable Bitcoin price around $120 in that period. Figure 5b plots
the ratio between F2Pool’s computation power over that of the whole network.
The ratio is also relatively stable from May to October 2013. Starting from
November 2013, motivated by the price surge of Bitcoin, the number of miners
increased more than ten times till March 2014. As illustrated in Fig. 5b, F2Pool’s
computation share also increases dramatically. This indicates that more miners
chose to join pool mining in the face of increasingly tense competition between
minors. In Fig. 6, we estimate the mean and median hash rate of F2Pool miners,
and how much computation power is controlled by the top 10 % powerful pool
miners. The mean is larger than the median and the top 10 % miners dominate
the computation power of the pool. This is because the hash rates of the top
pool miners are signiﬁcantly larger than the low-end miners. Since the earning
of a minor in a pool is proportional to her hash rate, the earning distribution

F2Pool
Top 10% Miners
Median Miner
Average Miner
Curious in knowing whether min-
ers can get their investment back,
we choose two mining hardwares
released in 2011 and 2013 respec-
tively. The ﬁrst one is MSI Radeon
HD 6990
card with
750 MHash/s and 410 W. The price
for this card at release was $699.
From 2010, mainstream miners
started to use graphics cards to do
mining instead of CPUs. We set a
starting date on 07/01/2011. We cal-
culate the card’s proﬁt rate according
Fig. 6. F2Pool miner hash rate vs. pool
to (4) using the real Bitcoin price and
hash rate
electricity prices in US and Italy respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a, this card gen-
erates positive proﬁts in US, breaks even (earns $699 back) on 2013/04/30, and
continues to make money till September 2013. Then the daily proﬁt becomes
negative even though the Bitcoin price kept increasing. This is because as more
minors joined the system, the diﬃculty value increased at a faster pace than the
Bitcoin price. According to (5), the card’s computation-over-power eﬃciency can
no longer sustain a positive proﬁt rate. Meanwhile, due to higher electricity price
(see Table 2), mining in Italy seldom gets positive proﬁt. There is no way for the
miner to recover her capital cost. In late 2012 and early 2013, powerful ASIC
mining hardware started to occupy the mining market. We estimate BFL SC
5 G/s mining cube, a 5, 000 MHash/s and 30 W advertised ASIC chip for just
$274. We ﬁnd that if it were purchased on 2013/07/01, no matter in US or Italy,
it would have broken even with less than one month. The major reason is that
the computation-over-power eﬃciency of this new card is about one hundred
times higher than MSI Radeon HD 6990 graphics card.
Finally, we estimate the computation power upper bound of Bitcoin network
according to (7). We use the current Bitcoin price and the average electricity

prices in diﬀerent countries [18] to estimate mining cost. We choose the current
best hardware SP35 YUKON ASIC chip, which has 6 THash/s and 3, 500 W.
Table 2 shows as the electricity price varies, the network computation power
upper bound can diﬀer by a factor of 2.5. The current Bitcoin network has a
computation power of 248, 116 THash/s. There is still room for growth. Since in
average the network computation power doubles every two months, our conjec-
ture is that the network will saturate in about half year, given that the Bitcoin
price and mining hardware eﬃciency stay still.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we characterized the evolution of Bitcoin miners’ productivity,
computation power and transaction activity by analyzing the full blockchain in
Bitcoin network. We showed how the largest mining pool in Bitcoin grows over
time and how computation power is distributed among its miners. We also built
a simple economic model that explains the evolution of mining hardware and
predicts the limit of the computation race game between miners.
