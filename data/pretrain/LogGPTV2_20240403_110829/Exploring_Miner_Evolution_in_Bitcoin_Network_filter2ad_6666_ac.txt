### Analysis of Bitcoin Mining and F2Pool's Computation Power

The stability of the Bitcoin price around $120 during a specific period is reflected in Figure 5b, which plots the ratio of F2Pool’s computation power to that of the entire Bitcoin network. This ratio remained relatively stable from May to October 2013. However, starting from November 2013, the number of miners increased more than tenfold by March 2014, driven by the surge in Bitcoin prices. As illustrated in Figure 5b, F2Pool’s share of the computation power also increased dramatically, indicating that more miners opted for pool mining in response to the intensifying competition.

Figure 6 provides an estimate of the mean and median hash rates of F2Pool miners, as well as the computational power controlled by the top 10% of powerful pool miners. The mean hash rate is higher than the median, and the top 10% of miners dominate the pool's computational power. This dominance is due to the significantly higher hash rates of the top-tier miners compared to those at the lower end. Since earnings in a mining pool are proportional to a miner's hash rate, the distribution of earnings among miners follows a power-law distribution, similar to wealth distribution in the real world.

### Sustainable Computation Power Under Current Bitcoin Price

Table 2 outlines the sustainable computation power under the current Bitcoin price for various countries, based on their average electricity prices in 2013:

| Country | Average Electricity Price (cent per kWh) | Computation Power Bound (THash/s) |
|---------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Italy   | 20.56                                  | 473,325                           |
| UK      | 13.61                                  | 715,031                           |
| Belgium | 11.77                                  | 826,812                           |
| US      | 9.33                                   | 1,043,041                         |
| Sweden  | 8.25                                   | 1,179,584                         |

### Economic Considerations

To understand the economic viability of mining, we analyzed two types of hardware: a graphics card and an ASIC miner. The first, the MSI Radeon HD 6990, released in 2011, has a hash rate of 750 MHash/s and consumes 410 W. Priced at $699 at release, this card was a popular choice for miners who transitioned from CPU to GPU mining. Using the actual Bitcoin price and electricity costs in the US and Italy, we calculated the card's profit rate. In the US, the card generated positive profits, broke even by April 30, 2013, and continued to be profitable until September 2013. After that, despite the increasing Bitcoin price, the daily profit turned negative due to the rapid increase in mining difficulty. In Italy, the higher electricity cost made it difficult for the card to generate any significant profit.

In late 2012 and early 2013, ASIC miners began to dominate the market. We estimated the performance of the BFL SC 5 G/s mining cube, which offers 5,000 MHash/s at 30 W for $274. If purchased on July 1, 2013, this ASIC miner would have broken even within a month, regardless of whether it was used in the US or Italy. The key factor is the much higher computation-over-power efficiency of the ASIC, which is about 100 times greater than that of the MSI Radeon HD 6990.

Finally, we estimated the upper bound of the Bitcoin network's computational power using the current Bitcoin price and average electricity prices in different countries. Table 2 shows that the network's computational power can vary by a factor of 2.5 depending on the electricity price. With the current network computation power at 248,116 THash/s, there is still room for growth. Given that the network's computational power doubles every two months, we predict that the network will reach its saturation point in about six months, assuming the Bitcoin price and mining hardware efficiency remain constant.

### Conclusion

This paper characterizes the evolution of Bitcoin miners' productivity, computational power, and transaction activity by analyzing the full blockchain. We examined the growth of the largest mining pool, F2Pool, and the distribution of computational power among its miners. Additionally, we developed a simple economic model to explain the evolution of mining hardware and predict the limits of the computational race between miners.
