I have few questions regarding celery. Please help me with that.
**Sorry for posting this here**. I asked the same in stackoverflow
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56681692/queries-regarding-celery-
scalability) but no reply.
  1. Do we need to put the project code in every celery worker? If yes, if I am increasing the number of workers and also I am updating my code, what is the best way to update the code in all the worker instances (without manually pushing code to every instance everytime)?
  2. Using `-Ofair` in celery worker as argument disable prefetching in workers even if have set `PREFETCH_LIMIT=8 or so`?
  3. IMPORTANT: Does rabbitmq broker assign the task to the workers or do workers pull the task from the broker?
  4. Does it make sense to have more than one celery worker (with as many subprocesses as number of cores) in a system? I see few people run multiple celery workers in a single system.
  5. To add to the previous question, whats the performance difference between the two scenarios: single worker (8 cores) in a system or two workers (with concurrency 4)
