### Title: CANCELLED: Too Soft[ware Defined] Networks: SD-WAN Vulnerability Assessment

**Abstract:**

Software-Defined Wide-Area Networks (SD-WAN) are a technology that applies the principles of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to branch office connections in enterprise environments. According to Gartner, more than 50% of traditional routers were expected to be replaced with SD-WAN solutions by 2020. SD-WAN solutions often include built-in firewalls and other perimeter security features, making them attractive targets for cyber attackers.

Vendors frequently tout "on-the-fly agility" and "enhanced security" as key benefits of SD-WAN. However, from a practical, hands-on perspective, what does "security" truly entail? Most SD-WAN solutions are deployed as Linux-based virtual appliances or cloud-centric services, which can make them vulnerable even to less sophisticated attackers, such as script kiddies.

This presentation will provide a comprehensive analysis of various SD-WAN solutions from an attacker's perspective. We will explore the attack surface, threat models, and real-world vulnerabilities present in these solutions. The goal is to offer a clear understanding of the potential risks and to highlight the importance of robust security practices in the deployment and management of SD-WAN technologies.
