titleblackhat:us-18 CANCELLED: Too Soft[ware Defined] Networks: SD-WAN VulnerabilityAssessment
The software defined wide-area network is technology based on SDN approach applied to branch office connections in Enterprises. According to Gartner's predictions, more than 50% of routers will be replaced with SD-WAN Solutions by 2020. The SD-WAN can have firewalls and other perimeter security features on board which makes them attractive targets for attackers. Vendors promise "on-the-fly agility, security" and many other benefits. But what does "security" really mean from a hand-on perspective? Most of SD-WAN solutions are distributed as Linux-based Virtual Appliances or a Cloud-centric service which can make them low-hanging fruit even for script kiddie.This presentation will introduce practical analysis of different SD-WAN solutions from the attacker perspective. Attack surface, threat model and real-world vulnerabilities in SD-WAN solutions will be presented.
