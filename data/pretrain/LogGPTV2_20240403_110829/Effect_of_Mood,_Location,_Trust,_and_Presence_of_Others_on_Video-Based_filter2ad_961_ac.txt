• mood; continuous (from 1 to 4)
• presence of others; categorical (no other people around;

We then present the reasons for agreeing to help or declin-
ing to video chat in Section 4.7 and Section 4.8, respectively.
Finally, we present the post-survey results in Section 4.9.
4.1 Participants’ Demographics
Participants’ demographic information was collected in the
pre-survey (see Section 3.2 and Appendix A). All of our
participants were recruited from the United States, distributed
across ten different states. Among the 30 participants, there
were more females than males (57% vs. 43%). Participants
fell primarily into the age range of 18-29 years old (see Table 1
for details). Eighty percent of the participants were white, with
the next most common race being Asian & Paciﬁc Islander
(17%). The participants self-reported a range of incomes: 23%
reported incomes under $30,000, and 33% reported incomes
over $75,000. The participants were also highly educated,
with the vast majority (97%) having attended at least some
college. The majority (63%) of the participants reported that
they used a PIN to unlock their phones. About 83% of our
participants self-reported having used video chat at least once
before the study. Of those 25 participants who had used video
chat before, most (84%) of them reported using video chat
for less than two hours per week. Twenty-four percent of our
participants self-reported not using video chat at all during a
typical week.
4.2 Apps and Sensitivity
Participants self-reported 261 unique apps installed on their
mobile phones (collected in the pre-survey, see Section 3.2
and Appendix A). We grouped these apps into 18 categories
based on Apple’s app category [48] (see Table 2). The most

frequently occurring app categories were social networking
(messaging, dating, photo sharing, etc.), productivity (email
client, note-taking, task management, etc.), and news (tele-
vision, video, RSS readers, etc.). This is consistent with the
statistics on mobile app use [43], indicating that our partic-
ipants were similar to many other mobile phone users. We
also asked participants to rate the sensitivity of each app they
reported (see Section 3.2). Finance apps (personal ﬁnancial
management, mobile banking, etc.), apps for shopping (Ama-
zon, eBay, Starbucks, etc.), and productivity apps were rated
as the top three most sensitive (see Table 2).
4.3 Response Rate and Time
Table 3 shows the responsiveness to the ESM prompts by
week over the course of the four-week study. In week one,
participants responded to 76.5% of all ESM prompts. In week
two, the response rate dropped to 58.7%. In week three, the re-
sponse rate stayed relatively consistent with week two, adding
about ﬁve percentage points to a 64.3% response rate. Dur-
ing the last week, the ESM response rate dropped to 49.1%.
This leveling off of participant responsiveness is consistent
with other ESM studies [32]. This is common for ESM inves-
tigations [87] and highlights the importance of conducting
the study over time. Across the entire study, participants re-
sponded to 62.0% of all the ESM prompts.
In general, participants were more likely to respond to help
with a video chat request than to initiate a request (χ2(1) =
15.09, p < .001). The average response time for each prompt
was 63.4 (± 3.1) minutes. The agreed responses had signif-
icantly shorter response time than denials responses (45.2
mins vs. 78.2 mins, U = 231,610, p < .001). Across partici-
pants, the response rates were similar. For initiate prompts,
they were between 52.6% and 70.2%. For help prompts, they
were between 68.9% and 73.1%.
4.4 Effect of Type of Request
As we reported in Section 4.3, not all the ESM prompts re-
ceived a response (which is common in ESM studies [32]).
Thus, we examined the effect of type of request in two ways.
The ﬁrst was more conservative than the second: 1) consider-
ing all non-responses as denials; 2) ignoring non-responses
and only examining the ESM prompts that received a response.
In both cases, participants were more willing to agree to re-
quests for help (49.1% of the time and 32.5% of the time,
respectively) than to agree that they would initiate (40.1% of
the time and 23.2% of the time, respectively) a video chat for
authentication (χ2(1) = 10.12, p = .001, see Table 4; χ2(1) =
13.27, p < .001, see Table 5). Although the numbers vary be-
tween participants, all of the participants in our study agreed
to initiate and help with a video chat for authentication at least
once.
4.5 Predictors of Initiating a Video Chat
As shown in Table 6, location, mood, and presence of others
had signiﬁcant effects on the willingness to initiate a video
chat for authentication, while the sensitivity of the app and
timing had no signiﬁcant effects. A Tukey’s post-hoc test
showed that while at work, participants were less likely to
initiate a video chat for authentication than at home (p =
0.020, odds ratio (OR) = 0.30, 95% Conﬁdence Interval (CI):
[0.14, 0.62]). Similarly, while driving a vehicle, participants
were less likely to initiate a video chat for authentication
than at home (p = .008, OR = 0.08, CI: [0.02, 0.35]). The

more positive and pleasant their mood was, the more likely
they were willing to initiate a video chat for authentication
(p = .001, OR = 5.23, CI = [2.77, 9.86]). Participants were
also less likely to initiate a video chat when they were with
strangers than when they were alone (p = .005, OR = 0.25,
CI: [0.11, 0.60]). When participants agreed to initiate a video
chat for authentication, they tended to choose someone they
knew prior to the study rather than someone they didn’t know
before the study (87.1% of the time vs. 12.9% of the time).
4.6 Predictors of Willingness to Help
As shown in Table 7, trust, location, mood, and presence of
others had signiﬁcant effects on the perceived willingness to
help with a video chat for authentication, while timing had
no signiﬁcant effect. A Tukey’s post-hoc test showed that the
higher the in-person trust was, the more likely participants
were to agree to help others with a video chat for authentica-
tion (p < .001, OR = 2.16, CI: [1.68, 2.77]). Note that since
in-person trust and whether the participants knew each other
prior to the study were almost perfectly correlated (r = .93, p
< .001), we used only trust (leaving out whether participants
knew each other prior to the study) as a predictor in the regres-
sion model. This was required to avoid multicollinearity [29],
which is when independent variables in a regression model
are highly correlated. We can see the trend in the descriptive
data about how whether people knew each other prior to the
study was related to their willingness to help: when the help
request was sent from someone the participants knew prior
to the study, participants were willing to help 63.3% of the
time. On the other hand, when the help request was sent from
someone the participants didn’t know prior to the study, the
participants were willing to help only 42.1% of the time.
While at work, participants were less likely to help with
a video chat for authentication than at home (p = .002, OR
= 0.27, CI: [0.14, 0.52]). Similarly, while driving a vehicle,
participants were less likely to help with a video chat for
authentication than at home (p < .001, OR = 0.05, CI: [0.01,
0.17]). Actually, when participants were driving a vehicle,
they were signiﬁcantly less likely to help with a video chat for
authentication than any other location. The more positive and
pleasant their mood was, the more likely they were willing
to help a video chat for authentication (p < .001, OR = 6.87,
CI: [3.80, 12.45]). Participants were also less likely to help
with a video chat when they were with people that they knew
than when they were alone (p < .001, OR = 0.37, CI: [0.23,
0.62]). Similarly, when participants were with strangers, they
were less likely to help with a video chat than when they were
alone (p < .001, OR = 0.27, CI: [0.12, 0.61]).
4.7 Reasons for Agreeing to Help
Participants were allowed to give one or more reasons why
they agreed to help per ESM prompt response. From the 325
times participants agreed to help via video chat, participants
provided 907 reasons, many of which overlapped. Across
these 907 responses, seven stood out, accounting for more
than 10% of reasons each (in other words, seven reasons ac-
