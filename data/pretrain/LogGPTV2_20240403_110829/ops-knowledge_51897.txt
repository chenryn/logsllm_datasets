Check whether firewalld is installed and running: ``` systemctl status firewalld ``` If not installed, use the following command to install: ``` yum install firewalld ``` If not running , you can use the following command to start and set the boot self-start: ``` systemctl start firewalld systemctl enable firewalld ``` 2. Allow specific ports or services to pass through: - Allow port ``` firewall-cmd --zone=public - -add-port=port number/tcp --permanent ``` For example, if you want to allow port 80 to pass through, you can use the following command: ``` firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80 /tcp --permanent ``` - allow service ``` firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=service name --permanent ``` For example, if you want to allow the SSH service to pass through, you can use The following command: ``` firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ssh --permanent ``` 3. Deny all other inbound network traffic: ``` firewall-cmd --zone=public -- set-default-zone=drop ``` The above command sets the default zone to "deny", which means that all traffic not explicitly allowed will be denied. 4. After completing the configuration, reload the firewall configuration: ``` firewall-cmd --reload ``` 5. View the configured rules: ``` firewall-cmd --list-all ``` The above is in CentOS 7 Steps to configure a firewall on a server and allow specific ports or services through.
