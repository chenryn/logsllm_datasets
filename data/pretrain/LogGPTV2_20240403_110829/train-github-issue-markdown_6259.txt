Subject: Display Issue with Font Sizes on Light Backgrounds

Hi Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am experiencing an issue where unusual lines appear when using different font sizes. Changing the font face does not resolve the problem. This issue is noticeable on all light backgrounds and is not limited to Vim.

For your reference, I have attached a screenshot that illustrates the problem.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Martin
