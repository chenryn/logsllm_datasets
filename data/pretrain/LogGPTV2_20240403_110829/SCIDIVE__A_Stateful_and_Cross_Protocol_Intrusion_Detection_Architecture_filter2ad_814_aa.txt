## Abstract
Voice over IP (VoIP) systems are becoming increasingly popular for transmitting voice traffic over IP networks. As the popularity of VoIP grows, these systems are being subjected to various types of intrusions, some specific to VoIP and others following general patterns. VoIP systems present several new challenges to intrusion detection system (IDS) designers. These include the use of multiple protocols for call management and data delivery, the distributed nature of the systems, a wide range of attack types, and the heterogeneity of administrative domains.

In this paper, we propose the design of an intrusion detection system specifically for VoIP environments, called SCIDIVE (pronounced "Skydive"). SCIDIVE is designed to detect different classes of intrusions, including masquerading, denial of service, and media stream-based attacks. It operates with both call management protocols (CMP), such as SIP, and media delivery protocols (MDP), such as RTP. SCIDIVE introduces two key abstractions: stateful detection and cross-protocol detection. Stateful detection involves assembling state from multiple packets and using the aggregated state in the rule-matching engine. Cross-protocol detection involves matching rules that span multiple protocols. We demonstrate SCIDIVE on a sample VoIP system comprising SIP clients and proxy servers, with RTP as the data delivery protocol. Four attack scenarios are created to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the system.

## 1. Introduction
Voice over IP (VoIP) systems are gaining popularity as a technology for transmitting voice traffic over IP networks. While VoIP is rapidly becoming more widespread, it is also being adopted by businesses to reduce telephone expenses. As the popularity of VoIP increases, these systems are becoming targets for various types of intrusions, some specific to VoIP and others following general patterns.

There have been significant advancements in intrusion detection systems (IDS) for different components of the information technology infrastructure. Some IDSs are generic and can be customized with detection rules specific to the environment (e.g., Snort [10] and Prelude [13]), while others are targeted to specific environments or types of intrusions, such as IBM Tivoli Intrusion Manager for MQSeries products [14].

VoIP systems pose several new challenges to IDS designers:
1. **Multiple Protocols:** These systems use multiple protocols for call management (e.g., SIP) and data delivery (e.g., RTP).
2. **Distributed Nature:** The systems are distributed and employ distributed clients, servers, and proxies.
3. **Wide Range of Attacks:** The attacks against VoIP systems span a large class, from denial of service to billing fraud.
4. **Heterogeneity:** The systems are heterogeneous and typically under several different administrative domains.

In this paper, we propose the design of an intrusion detection system for VoIP environments, called SCIDIVE (pronounced "Skydive"). SCIDIVE is structured to detect different classes of intrusions, including masquerading, denial of service, and media stream-based attacks. It can operate with both call management protocols (CMP), such as SIP, and media delivery protocols (MDP), such as RTP. SCIDIVE introduces two key abstractions: stateful detection and cross-protocol detection. Stateful detection involves assembling state from multiple packets and using the aggregated state in the rule-matching engine. Cross-protocol detection involves matching rules that span multiple protocols. SCIDIVE can be installed at multiple points—clients, servers, or proxies—and can be extended to detect new classes of attacks without substantial customization.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of VoIP systems and attack classification. Section 3 presents the architecture of SCIDIVE and motivates the stateful and cross-protocol detection through running examples. Section 4 discusses the implementation of SCIDIVE, the kinds of attacks simulated, and the analysis of the system's efficiency. Section 5 reviews related work, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. System Description: VoIP Systems and Attack Classification

### 2.1. VoIP Overview
Voice over IP (VoIP) systems provide facilities for setting up and managing voice communications based on one of two main protocols: H.323 [2] and SIP [3]. H.323 is the most widely deployed standard in VoIP communications, but SIP is increasing in popularity due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.

In both types of systems, endpoints or terminals (which may be physical phones or software programs executing on a general-purpose computer) send and receive RTP [4] packets containing encoded voice conversations. Since voice calls may be made between IP phones and phones on the Public-Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), gateways often perform transparent translation between IP and non-IP based networks. Such gateways may implement protocols for media gateway management, such as MGCP [5] and MEGACO/H.248 [6].

Within an H.323 network, an optional gatekeeper may be present. The gatekeeper performs functions such as authorizing network access, managing quality of service, and providing address-translation services. Multipoint conferences between three or more terminals or gateways may be managed by specialized controllers.

SIP networks also include additional types of servers. A proxy server forwards requests, possibly after performing some processing or translation. A redirect server supports mobile clients by performing address translation for accepted requests and returning the new address to the originator. Both proxy and redirect servers may be used to implement call forwarding and other similar services. User agent clients send requests to user agent servers to initiate calls, and the user notifies a registrar of their current location to allow others to contact them. The registrar is often combined with a proxy or redirect server.

Both H.323 and SIP provide protocols for call setup, management, and media delivery. Voice is encoded using a negotiated codec and delivered using RTP over UDP/IP for both protocols. However, call setup and management differ. H.323 relies on the H.225.0 [7] and H.245 protocols [8], whereas SIP uses a simpler set of request messages: INVITE, ACK, OPTIONS, BYE, CANCEL, and REGISTER. SIP provides a globally reachable address to which callees bind using the SIP REGISTER method. The INVITE message is used by a user client agent to initiate a session, which can be responded to with an OK, followed by an ACK. To tear down a connection, a BYE message is sent. CANCEL cancels a pending invite, and OPTIONS is used to query or change optional parameters of the session, such as encryption.

Figure 1 illustrates a typical set of SIP messages leading to a session.

### 2.2. VoIP Attacks
One of the main advantages of a VoIP system is the convergence of voice and data networks, with voice being conveyed over a data network. While this offers cost and management benefits, it also makes the system vulnerable to the same threats as the data network. This includes well-known attacks such as denial of service and authentication attacks. While vulnerabilities not specific to VoIP can be handled by existing IDSs, this is not sufficient. VoIP systems introduce potential vulnerabilities related to toll fraud, privacy, and denial of service attacks based on degrading the quality of service of the voice conversation.

A major source of vulnerabilities lies in the protocols used to set up and manage calls. Both H.323 and SIP transmit packet headers and payload in clear text, allowing attackers to forge packets that manipulate device and call states. For example, such forged packets can prematurely terminate calls, redirect calls, or facilitate toll fraud. Efforts are underway to develop encrypted signaling, but no solution has found widespread adoption.

In addition to vulnerabilities in the signaling protocols, the RTP protocol for media delivery also introduces several vulnerabilities due to the absence of authentication and encryption. Each RTP packet header...
