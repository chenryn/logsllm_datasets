I encountered an issue after attempting to install three Python plugins in NetBeans 7, which I usually use for Java development on my Mac OS X. After selecting the "Restart NetBeans" option, the application closed and now it won't open. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this? Additionally, is there a way to revert NetBeans to its state before the plugin installation?

**Response:**

I had a similar problem, but on Windows 7. To resolve it, I deleted the `.netbeans` directory located in my home folder. This fixed the issue for me. I hope this solution works for you as well.
