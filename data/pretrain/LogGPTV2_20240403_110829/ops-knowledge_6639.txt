User: I went to tools, plugins. Then chose to install the three python items that show up. After installation. I choose the restart netbeans option. But instead of restarting, netbeans just closed. And now it is not opening. Any ideas how to fix this? I normally develop Java on my netbeans 7 install.
I am using a mac osx
I see there are no takers, so let me ask this: Is there a way to revert to before the new plugin install?
Assistant: I had the same problem, but with Windows 7. I deleted the .netbeans directory located in my home folder. That fixed my problem, hope it fixes yours.
