does not using chaff points to hide the secret (Key). Thus, the
communication overheads between the sender and the receiver

subset of coefﬁcients together. t affects the performance of
the proposed ECG-IJS scheme as shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.
In addition, the value of t could be pre-deﬁned/pre-deployed in
the sensor nodes within the same body area network according
to the authentication performance requirements (i.e., FAR or
FRR). When the receiver receives the subset of the monic
polynomial coefﬁcients, it can reconstruct the ECG monic
polynomial based on the ECG signal it samples from the same
human body as the sender.

D. System Design
A typical proposed design for the message authentication is
described in Figure 4. A example applications shown in the
ﬁgure is using WBSNs for diabetes monitoring in which the
glucose sensors deployed or implanted in the skin continuously
monitor and wirelessly transmit the blood glucose levels to the
microchip-based control devices for an accurate, timely, and
efﬁcient insulin release. In such a system, the integrity and
conﬁdentiality of sensitive medical data among sensor nodes
must be protected against modiﬁcation or other malicious
attacks, because malicious or fraudulent (i.e. alteration of drug
dosages or treatment procedures) can be extremely hazardous
[23]. Other similar attacks include deliberation of health data
Fig. 4. ECG-IJS authentication scheme
Because of the limited resources in body sensors in terms of
power and computation capability, and transmission capability,
an energy-efﬁcient solution is required to secure the data
transmission. In the proposed ECG-IJS scheme, at the sender,
features F are extracted from the ECG signals to form a secret
k, which is used to encrypt the glucose data or general mes-
sage, and then it sends the encrypted message, IJS coefﬁcients
and the HASH based message authentication code (MAC) to
the receiver. After the receiver gets the packet, it could recover
the secret k using the ECG signal measured at the receiver’s
site and then decrypt the encrypted message using the key k.
When the message are received at the receiver, the MAC is
re-calculated from it using the same algorithm. The results
will be compared with the received MAC to complete the
authentication precess. A monic polynomial with a degree s
is generated at the sender based on the ECG features. Then t
coefﬁcients are sent to the receiver with a hash value. After
receiving the t coefﬁcients, the receiver begins to recover the
other s(cid:0)t coefﬁcients based on the t received coefﬁcients and
the ECG feature the reciever measures. If the ECG features
at the receiver are similar with the ones at the sender, the
receiver will be able to recover the other s (cid:0) t coefﬁcients of
the monic polynomial. If the re-calculated hash value matches
with the received hash value, then the receiver has successfully
recovered the s-t coefﬁcients set and the authentication process
is completed. In the proposed ECG-IJS scheme, we assume
that both the sender and the receiver have the capability
of sampling the ECG signals from the human body. This
assumption could be realized by attaching an ECG sensor to
a body sensor node such as a glucose sensor. However, the
ECG measurements on the different areas of the body could
still be different. We use the FFT peak index as a feature
to characterize and tolerate the differences on the same body
while they are signiﬁcantly different on different bodies. The

whole process is described as follows:
Step 1. Key Hiding: The sender measures the ECG signals
and glucose data, and the glucose data will be sent to the
receiver. The receiver have statistically similar ECG signals
when two sensors measure the ECG from the same body. Both
the sender and the receiver use the same future extraction algo-
rithm to generate feature set called IJS coefﬁcients. The feature
extraction algorithm is presented in details in Section IV. Once
the features are generated, the sender uses it as a key to
encrypt the Glucose data, and then send the following packet to
the receiver: fIDs; IDr; E; S; N1; M AC(k; SjMjN1jIDs)g,
where the IDs and IDr are the IDs of the sender and receiver,
respectively. M is the original message. E is the encrypted
message. N1 is a nonce used for the signature. S is the
subset of t monic polynomial coefﬁcients. M AC is a message
authentication code using Hash functions(e.g., SHA-1 or SHA-
2), and the k is generated from the ECG features at the receiver
site.
Step 2. Key recovering: After receiving the package from
the sender, the receiver uses the feature extracting from the
ECG and the receiver data set S to recover the secret k by
the proposed ECG-IJS algorithm. The secret k is further used
to decrypt the encrypted message E to obtain the original
Glucose data M.
Step 3. Authentication: The receiver uses the same authen-
tication algorithm with the sender to recalculate the M AC.
If the M AC value calculated by the receiver is equal to
the M AC value received from the sender, the authentication
succeeds. Otherwise, the authentication fails and the received
packet will be discarded.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we validate the proposed ECG-IJS scheme.
The validation begins with the feature extraction from the ECG
signals, followed by the False Accept Ratio (FAR) and False
Reject Ratio (FRR) analysis. After that, the security analysis
of the proposed ECG-IJS scheme is discussed.
A. Feature Extraction
When two sensors in a WBSNs want to securely communi-
cate each other by using ECG signal measured separately from
the same body, The ECG features ﬁrstly need to be extracted
from the sampled ECG signals. In our proposed scheme, we
perform a frequency domain analysis of ECG signals for
generating the features. This is because that the frequency
components of physiological signals, at any given time, have
statistically similar values as long as they are measured on
the body. A time domain analysis shows that the values of
the ECG signals measured at different parts of the body (from
different leads) have similar trend but diverse values. In this
validation process of the proposed ECG-IJS scheme, the ECG
5
signals are downloaded from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database
[24]. The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database contains 48 half-
hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings.
The recordings were digitized at 360 samples per second per
channel with 11-bit resolution over a 10 mV range [25]. The
Feature extraction process is shown as follows:
1) Get the ECG data for a ﬁxed time duration of 4 seconds.
The reason for choosing a 4 seconds duration is that we
want it to include at least one heart beat.
2) Re-sample the ECG data at 120Hz.
3) Conduct 512 points Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the
ECG data; Extract the ﬁrst 256 coefﬁcients because the
coefﬁcients are symmetric.
4) Detect the local peaks on the extracted FFT coefﬁcients;
Each of the peak location index is used as a feature.
The ECG signals measured on the different areas of the
body have statistically similar values within a time period.
There are two reasons for selecting the FFT peak location
index as a feature. Firstly, the feature changes dynamically but
can easily be detected with low computational complexity; sec-
ondly, the body’s physiological behaviors will be characterized
by the peak location index features in the Fourier transform
domain. Therefore, the peak location index is a good candidate
that can be used to differentiate measurements (collected by
a sensor) of one patient from those of different patients. The
feature provides an efﬁcient representation of ECG signals for
the data authentication and secret key agreement. However, our
proposed authentication framework does not limit to using the
peak location index. Potential features such as the P-R interval
could also be applied as long as they can meet the required
authentication performance (i.e., FAR and FRR).
B. Performance Analysis
In our experiment, we consider securing the communication
between any two nodes within the same WBAN. We assume
that the sensor nodes have the capability of measuring the
ECG signals with an attached ECG sensor. In addition, we
set the path loss exponent to 3 and 7 for the line of sight
(LOS) channel and non-LOS channel same as in [29], re-
spectively. In this part, False Accept Ratio (FAR) and False
Reject Ratio(FRR) are used to evaluate the performance of
the proposed ECG-IJS scheme. The Half Total Error Rate
(HTER), computed by HTER=(FAR+FRR)/2, is also obtained.
Ten person’s ECG data were randomly selected from MIT-
BIH Arrhythmia Database [24]. The FAR, FRR and HTER
performance evaluated by the ten person’s ECG data versus
to the difference tolerance t (polynomial degree s is 8) are
shown in Table I. The performance of FAR versus the FRR is
given in Figure 5.
As shown in Figure 5,
the FAR decrease as the FRR
