User: An enterprise needs to build an internal GitLab server for code management and continuous integration/continuous delivery. Please provide the server construction plan and installation steps.
Assistant: Solution: 1. Choose a server as the GitLab server. A server with 4 cores and 8G or above is recommended, and the Linux or Windows system can be used. 2. Install the GitLab software. 3. Configure the GitLab server, including adding users and projects, configuring CI/CD, etc. Installation steps: 1. Install necessary software dependencies, such as curl, openssh-server, etc. ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates tzdata ``` 2. Add the GitLab software repository. ``` curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.deb.sh | sudo bash ``` 3. Install GitLab CE. ``` sudo apt-get install gitlab-ce ``` 4. Modify the GitLab configuration file. ``` sudo vi /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb ``` Add the following configuration to the file: ``` external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com' ``` 5. Restart the GitLab service to make the new configuration take effect. ``` sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure sudo gitlab-ctl restart ``` 6. Open the browser, visit the URL of GitLab, log in and set the administrator account and password. 7. Configure CI/CD, for details, refer to the GitLab documentation. At this point, the GitLab server is set up, and users and projects can be added for code management and continuous integration/continuous delivery.
