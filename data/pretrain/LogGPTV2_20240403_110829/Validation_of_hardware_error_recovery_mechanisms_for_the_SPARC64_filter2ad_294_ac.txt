hardware verification program which is designed to
catch hardware failures. LINPACK is a standard HPC
floating-point benchmark that
implements a linear
equation solver.
gcc and bzip2 were selected from the SPEC
CPU2000 integer benchmark suite; gcc is a C compiler
and bzip2 is a file compression program. galgel and
sixtrack were selected from the SPEC CPU2000 floating
point benchmark suite; galgel is a computational fluid
dynamics program and sixtrack is a design program for
high-energy nuclear accelerators. All 6 programs check
results for correct program execution.
Given the probability of a single-bit error in a 72-bit
the probability of two single-bit errors
word is P,
accumulating in one word is roughly p2
• For accelerated
tests, this probability P is multiplied by the acceleration
factor Acc, and the single-bit error probability becomes
Acc x P. The probability for the accumulation of two
single-bit errors in one word is (Acc x p)2. This suggests
that
the frequency of accumulated double-bit errors
during an accelerated test is larger than the scaled value
by a factor of Acc and the acceleration factor for this
experiment is on the order of 108
•
A sizable number of uncorrectable multi-bit SRAM
errors were observed. The results of the static test
indicate that multi-bit errors are unlikely to be generated
in a single word by one neutron collision. These
multi-bit errors may therefore be attributed to the
accumulation ofmultiple hits and considered artifacts of
accelerated testing. Observed multi-bit SRAM error
events were removed from the measured error count.

All single-bit errors in the SRAM arrays were
corrected by the SECDED ECC and other recovery
mechanisms.
4.3. Logic soft-error measurement under
program execution
The occurrence of logic errors was also recorded
while running the 6 programs discussed in the preceding
section.
Although SPARC64 V implements the various error
detection mechanisms shown in Figure 1 and Table 2,
the amount of error information available while running
programs is very limited compared to the static test,
where all latches can be accessed by scan chain.
During normal server operation, the occurrence of
hardware detected errors, including single bit SRAM
error events, are reported by an interrupt and logged for
diagnostic purposes. The high frequency of single-bit
SRAM errors
accelerated testing would
overwhelm the diagnostic logging capability: instead,
hardware error detection information was collected via
polling. The resolution of the error detection timing is
somewhat compromised.
during
The PRIMEPOWER 650 is an 8-CPU symmetric
multi-processor system. When a logic error occurs in the
bus control logic for a single CPU (including the cache
coherency mechanism between CPUs), the bus protocol
hangs and innocent (error-free) CPUs may fail with a
watchdog timeout
if their bus access cannot be
completed in time. For this reason,
the watchdog
timeout failures of multiple CPUs in a short period of
time were regarded as the result of one error.
The total number of logic errors was estimated
based on the latch error probability obtained from the
static measurements by considering the acceleration
factor at each module position. The occurrence of logic
errors in combinatorial gates was neglected. Hence the
following logic derating factors
conservative
estimates.
are
As shown in Table 3, 93.6% of the estimated latch
flips "vanished," i.e., the system did not fail and no error
information was recorded. The remaining 6.4% of latch
flips were detected by the parity checkers, other error
detection mechanisms or simply felt as the system failed
without error information.
When an error is detected by hardware, the error
recovery mechanisms try to recover from the error.
These mechanisms are summarized in Table 2. In these
tests, 4.9% of the logic errors were recovered by the
hardware. The remaining 1.5% were fatal and resulted
in system failures.
Thus, the latch AVF ofthe SPARC64 V processor is

1.5%. Among the fatal errors observed was one instance
of SDC while running galgel. The remaining fatal errors
resulted in the system going down.
For noticed errors, hardware error information was
missing in about 10% of the cases. This 90% detection
ratio matches the latch parity coverage of 86%. The
processor successfully recovered from errors 76% ofthe
time, slightly better than the estimated 67%.
Figure 10 shows the logic derating factor for noticed
errors (# of observed errors divided by # of errors that
occurred) under execution of each of the 6 test programs.
Floating point benchmarks (LINPACK, galgel and
sixtrack) tend to exhibit higher derating factors than the
integer benchmarks, as errors in floating point registers
and execution units affect the correctness of floating
point benchmarks but not integer benchmarks. Errors in
fixed-point registers and execution units affect both
integer and floating-point benchmarks.

5. Conclusions
Accelerated soft error measurements were carried
out for the SPARC64 V microprocessor using the white
neutron beam facility at Osaka University's RCNP. The
SPARC64 V is manufactured with a 90nm bulk CMOS
process.
Fail bit maps generated from SRAM static test
measurements indicate that the frequency of double-bit
errors in a single word due to one neutron hit
is
extremely low. Multiple-bit errors observed during test
program runs were primarily caused by multiple
