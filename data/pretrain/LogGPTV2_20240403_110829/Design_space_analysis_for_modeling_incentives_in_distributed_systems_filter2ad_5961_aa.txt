ABSTRACT
Distributed systems without a central authority, such as peer-to-
peer (P2P) systems, employ incentives to encourage nodes to fol-
low the prescribed protocol. Game-theoretic analysis is often used
to evaluate incentives in such systems. However, most game-
theoretic analyses of distributed systems do not adequately model
the repeated interactions of nodes inherent in such systems. We
present a game-theoretic analysis of a popular P2P protocol, Bit-
Torrent, that models the repeated interactions in such protocols. We
also note that an analytical approach for modeling incentives is of-
ten infeasible given the complicated nature of most deployed pro-
tocols. In order to comprehensively model incentives in complex
protocols, we propose a simulation-based method, which we call
Design Space Analysis (DSA). DSA provides a tractable analysis
of competing protocol variants within a detailed design space. We
apply DSA to P2P ﬁle swarming systems. With extensive simula-
tions we analyze a wide-range of protocol variants and gain insights
into their robustness and performance. To validate these results and
to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of DSA, we modify an instrumented
BitTorrent client and evaluate protocols discovered using DSA. We
show that they yield higher system performance and robustness rel-
ative to the reference implementation.

INTRODUCTION
Incentives play an important role in distributed systems with no
centralized authority. Proper incentives ensure that the prescribed
protocol is followed by all the nodes, i.e., the protocol is robust to
strategic manipulation. A powerful tool for modeling incentives is
game theory, the branch of economics that can model individual
behavior in strategic situations [22]. The general applicability and
predictive powers of game theory has allowed designers to employ
it in a variety of contexts for the design of distributed systems [3,
29, 31].
In analyzing incentives in distributed systems, many papers
model the node interaction as a one-shot game. However, many
distributed settings involve repeated games in populations of inter-
acting players where such approaches do not apply. In this paper, as
our ﬁrst contribution, we present a game-theoretic model of a dis-
tributed protocol that aims to capture some of the repeated aspects
of such systems.
Furthermore, theoretical analyses often require high levels of ab-
straction to keep the models simple. This is required because in-
volved models can become analytically intractable [19]. Thus, for
modeling complex protocols, a theoretical analysis runs the risk of
missing out on important variables that could have signiﬁcant ef-
fects on protocol design. For instance, while designing a protocol,
it is not uncommon for the designer to employ a variety of arbitrary
design decisions and so-called “magic numbers”. Modifying any of
these can have negative effects on the robustness of the protocol’s
incentives. In other words, there are many elements in complex
protocols that could be gamed by strategic nodes.
A simulation based approach has been used by Axelrod [1] to
model strategic interactions in repeated games. As our second
contribution, taking inspiration from Axelrod, we aim to devise a
method which can be used to analyze protocols more comprehen-
sively. To that end, we present a simulation-based approach that we
call Design Space Analysis (DSA). DSA combines the speciﬁcation
of a design space with an analysis of varying protocols within that
space.
The speciﬁcation of a design space comprises two steps: Param-
eterization and Actualization. Parameterization involves identify-
ing salient design dimensions for the space, while Actualization
involves specifying multiple implementations for the identiﬁed di-
mensions.
For an analysis of the design space, we present a solution con-
cept, which we term the Performance, Robustness, and Aggressive-
ness (PRA) quantiﬁcation. For a protocol Π, Performance is the
overall performance of the system when all nodes execute Π (where
182performance is deﬁned by the application); Robustness is the ability
of a majority of the population executing Π to outperform a minor-
ity executing a protocol other than Π; and Aggressiveness is the
ability of a minority of the population executing Π to outperform
a majority executing a protocol other than Π. PRA quantiﬁcation
takes the form of a tournament in which each protocol competes
against every other protocol. By evaluating each protocol in the
space, the PRA quantiﬁcation simulates strategic variants and pre-
dicts their effects.
We choose the domain of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems for apply-
ing and exploring our ideas, because there are many such deployed
systems, for which incentive-compatible design is of primary im-
portance to counter strategic behavior. We undertake the following
steps. We apply a game-theoretic analysis to the popular P2P pro-
tocol, BitTorrent, and devise a more robust variant by incorporating
the repeated aspects of the protocol (Section 2). Then we perform
a Design Space Analysis of P2P ﬁle swarming systems. We run ex-
periments on a cluster and discover that there are several protocols
that do better than this variant with respect to Performance, Robust-
ness, and Aggressiveness (Section 3 & 4). Finally, we implement
modiﬁcations to BitTorrent and with experiments on a cluster, an-
alyze some protocols discovered using DSA. We show that they
yield higher system performance and robustness as compared to
the reference implementation, thus demonstrating the effectiveness
of DSA (Section 5).
2. GAME-THEORETIC ANALYSIS OF
BITTORRENT
We consider one of the most popular P2P protocols, BitTorrent
(BT), for our analysis. Our reason for choosing BitTorrent is that
this protocol has probably been the most widely studied P2P pro-
tocol in the literature. A game-theoretic approach has often been
applied to BitTorrent [12, 16, 26].
First, we present a model of BitTorrent as a strategy in a game.
In game theory, a game is a description of a strategic interaction
that includes the constraints on the actions that the players can take
and the players’ interests [22]. Then we present an analysis of
this model for multiple bandwidth classes. Under our assumptions,
which are different from previous work [26], we show that BitTor-
rent is not a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we design a modiﬁcation to
BitTorrent, which is a Nash equilibrium.
We assume the reader is familiar with certain game-theoretic
constructs such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD), a game between
two players in which it is the dominant strategy of both players to
defect.
2.1 BitTorrent as a strategy in a game
We explain the basics of the BitTorrent protocol from an iterated
games setting perspective. Each peer plays a number of games with
other peers in a given time period, following a Tit-for-Tat (TFT)
like strategy. TFT is the strategy using which a player cooperates
on the ﬁrst move and then simply mimics what the other player
did in the last round.
In BitTorrent a peer cooperates with (i.e.,
uploads to) a certain number of preferred (fastest uploading) part-
ners while it defects in the rest of the games. These are the ‘reg-
ular unchokes’ in BT terminology. Additionally, a peer also starts
new games with other peers in search of better partners. These are
‘optimistic unchokes’ in BT terminology. In these games, a peer
always cooperates unconditionally for some iterations. We do not
model the seeders in BitTorrent as these do not affect our subse-
quent Nash equilibrium analysis. This is because we assume, like
Chow et al. [4], that seeders interact uniformly with all peers.
We now present an analysis of our model in a system containing
two classes of peers: fast and slow. The game interaction in Figure
1(a) captures the dynamics between a fast peer and a slow peer,
where f is the upload speed of a fast peer and s is the upload speed
of a slow peer. This game represents a single round in an iterated
scenario, where the ‘shadow of the future’ is large (i.e., the payoff
of subsequent moves is important relative to the previous move)
and peers can form sustained relationships. It can be seen that given
the payoffs, the dominant strategy for fast peers is to always defect
on the slow peers. This is because when a fast peer cooperates
with a slow peer, there is an opportunity cost associated with it.
Opportunity cost is an important concept in economics. It is the
cost of an alternative that must be given up in order to pursue a
certain action [8].
We note here that by incorporating the ‘shadow of the future’
and opportunity costs in our ‘game’ we try to model two key as-
pects of the BitTorrent protocol usually ignored in traditional game-
theoretical analysis. These aspects are: (a) the repeated interactions
between peers; and (b) the wide choice of partners that peers can
have.
A fast peer’s opportunity cost in cooperating with a slow peer
is a missed interaction with another fast peer. When a fast peer
cooperates with a slow peer, it gets a negative utility of s− f . It
gets s from the slow peer but on the other hand, loses out on a
potential f from a fast peer. Conversely, for the slow peers, the
dominant strategy is to always cooperate with the fast peers. A
slow peer on defecting against a fast peer gets f from the fast peer
and can form a relationship with a slow peer, where it gets s− f
(where − f is the opportunity cost of cooperating with a slow peer),
thus getting a ﬁnal utility of f + (s− f ) = s. Figure 1(b) depicts
this scenario: a slow peer responds (with cooperation in the form
of a ‘regular unchoke’ slot) upon being optimistically unchoked
by a fast peer, while the converse does not hold. In light of this,
we note here that the Prisoner’s Dilemma is not an accurate model
for BitTorrent under heterogeneous classes of peers. Instead, the
way BitTorrent implements the interaction of a slow peer with a
fast peer, resembles an interaction in the Dictator game, a game in
which one player proposes to do something, while the other has no
choice but to respond passively without any strategic input into the
decision. It also resembles a game which has been called by some
as the One-Sided Prisoner’s Dilemma [28]. For simplicity, we refer
to it here as the BitTorrent Dilemma.
Next we give an analytical model of BitTorrent for multiple
bandwidth classes, using the BitTorrent Dilemma game as depicted
in Figure 1(a).
2.2 Analytical model of BitTorrent Dilemma
In this section, we model the BitTorrent Dilemma game with
multiple bandwidth classes of peers. We seek to calculate the ex-
pected number of games that a peer c from a particular class, with
payoffs deﬁned according to Figure 1(a), can win against other
peers, where winning means getting cooperation from others.
In the remainder of this section we derive the formulae for the
expected number of games that peer c wins against other players
from different classes. We note that there are two types of games
that a player c can win: 1) the games that it wins when others re-
ciprocate to it; and 2) when other players start a new game with c
and in line with TFT, cooperate unconditionally, thereby giving c a
free game win.
We use the notation summarized in Table 1. Note that we as-
sume, for notational simplicity, that the number of new partners
that a peer cooperates with unconditionally (number of optimistic
unchoke slots in BT terminology) is equal to 1. Moreover, it is also

NA + NB + NC −Ur − 1
First, we calculate the expected number of games that can be
won against higher classes. We assume that NA is greater than Ur;
thus, as per Figure 1(a), players employing TFT in higher classes
will not reciprocate with peer c. Therefore,
Er[A → c] = 0.
However, as per the TFT policy, peers from higher classes, un-
knowingly, do offer ﬁrst move cooperation to peers from lower
classes in search for better partners. The probability that peers in
class C are offered a ‘free game win’ by a peer from the higher
classes is NC/Nr, giving E[A → C] = NA × NC/Nr, which is the ex-
pected number of ‘free game wins’ that peers from higher classes
offer to players in the considered class C. This leads to
E[A → c] = NA/Nr.
