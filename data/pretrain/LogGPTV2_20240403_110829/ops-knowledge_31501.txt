User:  How to set up Nginx reverse proxy to direct requests to different servers to achieve load balancing? You need to consider aspects such as Nginx configuration files, addition and deletion of upstream servers, and real-time log monitoring.
Assistant: To set up the Nginx reverse proxy to achieve load balancing, the following steps are required: 1. Install Nginx and configure the reverse proxy: For detailed installation methods and configuration tutorials, please refer to the official Nginx documentation. 2. For multiple upstream servers that need to be load balanced, they need to be defined as Nginx upstream servers. It can be defined in the configuration file using the upstream module. For example: upstream myserver { server 192.168.1.100:8080; server 192.168.1.101:8080; server 192.168.1.102:8080; } This defines an upstream server named myserver, which contains three different IP addresses and ports . 3. Set the proxy location of the Nginx configuration file: location / { proxy_pass http://myserver; } In this way, all requests are forwarded to the server above myserver, and basic load balancing is also achieved. 4. During operation, upstream servers can be added or removed as needed. For example, the updated list of upstream servers in the configuration file can be reloaded with the nginx -s reload command. 5. Understand the log monitoring method of Nginx, you can use the log recording function provided by Nginx or a third-party log monitoring tool for real-time monitoring. The above are the basic steps and precautions for setting up Nginx reverse proxy to achieve load balancing.
