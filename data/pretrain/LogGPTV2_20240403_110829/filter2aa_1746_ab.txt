project started at Indiana University to “The 
Truthy system evaluates thousands of tweets 
an hour to identify new and emerging bursts of 
activity around memes of various flavors.”… 
“We also plan to use Truthy to detect political 
smears, astroturfing, misinformation, and other 
social pollution”

“A well-functioning democracy requires 
accountability and trust…” 
Slide 35 
And in 2011,  it was revealed that the US were 
exploring fake persona’s. The anonymous 
attack on HBGary exposed emails discussing 
such use cases… 
Slide 36 
“A large virtual population, scattered all over 
the world and encompassing different 
socioeconomic backgrounds, could be 
programmed to support any personal, social, 
business, political, military, or terrorist 
agenda.” 
(Temmingh & Geers, 2009)
So it seemed that Temmingh and Geer’s future 
looking paper had it pretty much right - “In 
2009, hackers steal data, send spam, and deny 
service to other computers. In the future, they 
may also control virtual armies, in the form of 
millions of artificial identities that could 
support any personal, business, political, 
military, or terrorist agenda.” 
Which leads us to more recent developments 
and a couple of things Tim Hwang is working 
on…

Slide 37 
I already mentioned the Web Ecology project. 
On the back of that, Tim created an 
organization called Pacific Social to explore 
social networks a little further.   
Slide 38 
Bridge Building
Social Bridge
Building
One thing they noticed with the Web Ecology 
project was that social bots can distort the 
social graph, so they’re examining whether it’s 
possible to use an army of social bots to stitch 
two separate online communities together… 
Slide 39 
Emotional Contagion
…They’re also interested in exploring whether 
bots can influence peoples moods.  We know 
this is possible in offline contexts, but far less is 
known about this phenomena online.  The 
implications of this may mean that it may 
become possible to take a perfectly happy 
group (for arguments sake, using sentiment 
analysis to measure this)…

..embedded a couple of bots that starts being a 
little more miserable (or Happy).…and look at 
how that permeates through the social graph 
Happiness  -

Slide 41 
….making more and more users a little less 
happy 
Slide 42 
….until a reasonable chunk of the social graph 
are less happy.  
Slide 43 
Social Penetration Testing
• Spread information with small inaccuracies
• See where they’re challenged & where they’re 
not challenged
• Identify who’s most influential but worst at 
evaluating what is real
• Target them
And finally he highlighted the potential for 
Social Penetration Testing. 
Slide 44 
It would be remise of me, not to mention Yazan 
Boshmaf from the Uni of British Columbia.  
Yazan and team investigate social bots on 
Facebook which generated a number of 
headlines (you can watch the Usenix 2012 
video)... 
Slide 45 
“To this end, we are currently investigating 
two directions from the defense side. The first 
involves understanding the factors that 
influence user decisions on befriending 
strangers, which is useful in designing user-
centered security controls that better 
communicate the risks of online threats.”
Boshmaf et al (2012)
As Yazan and team state. ‘understanding the 
factors that influence user decisions on 
befriending strangers’.

Understanding User Behaviour

Cyberspace
Insider Threat Project
Understanding User Behaviour is also 
something which the folks are the Secure & 
Trustworthy CyberSpace program (in the US) 
are examining and the Insider Threat project at 
Oxford Uni 
…so understanding more about human 
behaviour, the signs to look for and how bots 
(and other humans) can exploit them, is a 
worthwhile question to explore.  Indeed, 
“Understanding and accounting for human 
behavior” is recognized in one of the 5 key 
areas in Secure & Trustworthy Cyberspace 
(SaTC) 
Scalability & compatibility

Spray & Pray may be (& remain) effective 
enough, but sending out Pawns to prod a target 
may only be effective for so long as the lead 
bot will likely be associated with suspended 
accounts (eventually). 
Slide 48 
Slide 49 
…so it’s a good bet that bot creators will find 
targeting users who’ll quite literally talk to 
anyone or anything, to be a very attractive 
prospect.…

…and there’s some form in this respect.  
Wagner et al have conducted research most 
closely to ours. They looked at the Twitter 
attributes responsible for user interaction in 
the Web Ecology project.  They found…. 
…we essentially repeated and extended this 
study by additionally looking at personality and 
also deploying a number of Proof of Concept 
experiments.

Slide 52 
610 Participants
We had roughly 600 participants who agreed to 
take part in a mystery experiment. 
Slide 53 
For each user, we obtains twitter information, 
klout score and personality traits. 
Slide 54 
Bota
Botb
We divided participants into two groups to 
speed up processing.  Each group had a bot 
assigned to it (bots were the same) 
Slide 55 
Bot Design
We used the Social Ecology Project’s winning 
bot model. (Available under MIT license).  We 
rewrote and slightly modified it in python.  (we 
intend to make it available via GitHub). 
Slide 56 
Bot Architecture
Targets.csv

questions.txt
(This slide will build) 
Initially, and to provide some credibility, each 
bot  
• started of by following some standard 
celebrity and news accounts. 
• built up a thin veneer of authenticity by 
populating a Word Press blog with pictures 
of dogs in knitted clothes. 
• commented that the weather was pleasant 
if it reach a certain temperature in a sea 
side town in the UK. 
• Tweeted something random 
After a couple of days, each bot would start 
following each of the participants in its list of 
targets (while continuing with the bot 
generated tweets about dogs and the 
weather). 
Once all targets had been followed, the bot 
would ask each participant an innocuous 
question and record whether there was a 
response. We used… 
Slide 57 
Random Tweets
• Do you love twitter as much as me?
• I've got all my own teeth you know
• toooo cute my dog is haha - am i yoda? haha
i talk like him!
This tweet from the Web Ecology bot gave me 
a real chuckle.   
“...i aint tellin no lies even a thug ladii cries but i 
show no fears i cry gangsta tears...”. FWIW, we 
removed tweets with expletives. 
Slide 58 
162 Unique Questions
• Ever milked a cow? 
• What's better? Dog or cat? 
• What super powers do you have or wish you 
had?
162 unique questions, such as… 
Slide 59 
Ever Milked a Cow?
Slide 60 
…and added an ELIZA engine to keep 
conversation going. (The Social bots, bot had a 
list of standard replies, we made ours a little 
more context aware). 
ELIZA—a computer program for the study of 
natural language communication between man 
and machine (Weizenbaum, 1966) 
Rogerian psychotherapist  Rogers, Carl (1951).

Slide 61 
Example Responses
r’Hello(.*)’
Hey, how is your day going so far?
Slide 62 
Example Responses
Interesting!
r’I think(.*)’
lol that's what she said :P
Slide 63 
Ethics
If you ask anyone researching social bots about 
ethics, you’ll get a similar response.  It’s 
difficult.  A simple tweet could cause someone 
to have a really bad day or worse.  Look at this 
interaction that the social bots winner had 
regarding a deceased cat. 
British Psychological Society – Code of Human 
Research Ethics -  
http://www.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/docu
ments/code_of_human_research_ethics.pdf 
“In accordance with Ethics Principle 3: 
Responsibility of the Code of Ethics and 
Conduct, psychologists should consider all 
research from the standpoint of the research 
participants, with the aim of avoiding potential 
risks to psychological well-being, mental health, 
personal values, or dignity.” 
Slide 64 
Finally, we 
did NOT 
attempt to get 
users to click 
links 
because… 
– A) It would 
have been 
a step too 
far.  
– B) We 
wanted to 
remain as 
close as 
possible to 
the Web 
Ecology 
bot, which 
was 
beginning 
to be 
studied/re
searched 
in 
academia. 
As security people, you might argue that we 
missed a trick here.  Yes we did, but 
deliberately. 
Slide 65 
Results & Statistical Findings
In the section we’ll focus more on the 
personality traits related to responding, in the 
following section on machine learning, we’ll 
look at features (as, a botmaster would likely 
be looking at features, not personality)
