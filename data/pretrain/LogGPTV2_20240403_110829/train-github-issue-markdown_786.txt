**Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
I found difference in client|server cursors behaviour:[BR]  
client - side cursor fills cursor.description after execute(), and server-side
cursor leave description 'None' after execute() until call of fetch...().[BR]  
I found it both on windows and linux, with postgres 8.1.2 and psycopg 2-2.0.51
(last stable version).[BR]  
SA looks in cursor description **before** calling fetch - see base.py line
562.
