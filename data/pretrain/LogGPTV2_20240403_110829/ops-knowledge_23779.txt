User: I know it is a good habit of using close to close a file if not used any more in Python. I have tried to open a large number of open files, and not close them (in the same Python process), but not see any exceptions or errors. I have tried both Mac and Linux. So, just wondering if Python is smart enough to manage file handle to close/reuse them automatically, so that we do not need to care about file close?
thanks in advance,
Lin
Assistant: There are two good reasons.

If your program crashes or is unexpectedly terminated, then output files may be corrupted.
It's good practice to close what you open.
