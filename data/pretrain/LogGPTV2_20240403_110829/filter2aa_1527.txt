Problem
7 | 
Problem: A lot of targeted attacks
More than 40 APT
8 | 
Problem: The biggest issue is...
Question: What is the biggest problem in APT seen from 
antivirus side?
Hard work
No detect
No sample
We collect mass spread samples. However, we could not get APT samples 
easily. Especially, second stage sample is extremely rare.
9 | 
Problem: Corrupted samples
We found samples, sometimes they were corrupted. That 
means they are executable but crashing:
1. Memory dump
2. Unknown binary data
3. Broken data
4. Cured by Anti Virus
5. Quarantined file 
6. Password encrypted archive without password
10 | 
Problem: Why corrupted samples?
Question: Why corrupted samples in recent APT?
I will tell you my answer
in conclusion
Motivation
12 | 
Motivation: What should we do?
Question: What should we do when we got corrupted 
malware in APT?
Just Ignore
Deep Analysis
Make AV signature
1. Checking really corrupted or not
2. Getting information of related others
13 | 
Motivation: Two recent APT cases
Probably corrupted (?) samples have found in two recent APT.
Emdivi
Elirks

Emdivi: Corrupted (?) samples
We collected more than 600 
samples related to this attacks, 
around 25 percents were Emdivi
samples. 
Among them, 6 percents did not 
work.
20 | 
Emdivi: Important data was encrypted 
Emdivi family stores encrypted important data:
C2, API name, strings for anti-analysis, value of mutexes, as well as 
the md5 checksum of backdoor commands and the internal proxy 
information
generate_base_key
salt1 = md5sum(version.c2id...)
aes key (16 byte)
xxtea key (32 byte)
salt2 = hardcoded long data
Modified xxtea_decrypt
encrypted data
%program files%

Emdivi: Corrupted (?) ustomized samples
Is it possible to analyze?
generate_base_key
salt1 = md5sum(version.c2id...)
aes key (16 byte)
xxtea key (32 byte)
salt2 = hardcoded long data
xxtea_decrypt + add and sub
encrypted data
unknown data
salt3 = SID of specific victim
%program files%
We could brute force a xxtea key

Emdivi: Corrupted (?) ustomized samples
Is it possible to analyze?
No
We published the details as a blog 
in securelist.com

Elirks: Overview
1.
As known as PLURK
2.
The Elirks APT campaign
3.
Unique schema to connect real C2
4.
Target Regions are Taiwan, Japan
5.
Trojan dropper is fake folder icon
6.
Decoys were sometimes airline e-ticket
This group uses several types of malware 
Elirks, Ymailer, Ymailer-mini and Micrass. 
This presentation is forcusing Elirks

Elirks: Unique schema to connect real C2
The Elirks malware has unique schema to connect real C2. It connects blogpost of legitimate 
site getting encrypted real C2 information.
Decrypt function

Real C2

Elirks: Corrupted (?) samples
We collected more than 200 
samples. 
Among them, less than 3 percent 
were probably corrupted.
Then we confirmed why these 
samples does not work.
31 | 
Elirks: Elirks has three encrypted data
0x417530 encrypted data (10768 byte)
0x419F40 encrypted data (10736 byte)
0x41FF88 encrypted data (1504 byte)

data_of_key_salt
aes_expkey_array[4]
0x401000 malware func1 (10768 byte)
0x405CF0 malware func2 (10736 byte)
0x41FF88 malware config (1504 byte)
aes key (16 byte)

Elirks: Decrypted Elirks 
0x401000 unknown data (10768 byte)
0x405cf0 unknown data (10736 byte)
0x41FF88 encrypted data (1504 byte)
0x401000 malware func1 (10768 byte)
0x405CF0 malware func2 (10736 byte)
0x41FF88 malware config (1504 byte)

Elirks: Corrupted (?) samples
A corrupted (?) sample does not decrypt malware config. 
That means does not work and can not analyze.
0x41CE28 encrypted data (1504 byte)
0x41CE28 malware config (1504 byte)

Elirks: Corrupted (?) ustomized samples
It was customized sample for specific victims

Conclusion
37 | 
Conclusion: Answer of my title’s question
Question: Why corrupted (?) samples in recent APT?
It’s not corrupted. 
The attacker developed 
customized malware 
When you find corrupted sample,
It might to be chance of analysis very interesting APT malware
38 | 
Conclusion: Whitelist approach in APT
Common malware should work in any environment. 
APT malware have to work in specific environment.
This approach and introduced new techniques are 
very simple ,However it works effectively.
