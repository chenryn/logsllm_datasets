User: im pretty new to all of this so please try to bear with me.
I've got a directory set up where i dump all the scripts im working on,
and i'm trying to make it so that i can run the scripts from within that directory directly from ipython.
so far, ive add an init.py to the aforementined directory,
and have tried appending the path to sys.path,
however, even after i successfully append the path, trying to use the run command for any script in the directory results in a not found error.
another problem i have, is that after every kernel reset the sys.path seems to reset to its previous values, without the new path settings i enter.
grateful for any help,
ron
Assistant: sys.path only affects imports, not IPython's %run. The run magic is like calling python script.py - you have to cd into the directory where scripts are, or pass the full path to those scripts.
