Subject: Assistance with Running Scripts from IPython

Hi,

I'm quite new to this, so please bear with me. I have a directory where I store all the scripts I'm working on. My goal is to be able to run these scripts directly from IPython while I'm in that directory.

So far, I have added an `__init__.py` file to the directory and attempted to append the directory path to `sys.path`. However, even after successfully appending the path, using the `run` command for any script in the directory still results in a "not found" error.

Additionally, I've noticed that after each kernel reset, `sys.path` reverts to its original values, losing the new path settings I added.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Ron

Hi Ron,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand your situation and can help clarify a few points.

The `sys.path` only affects module imports, not the `%run` magic command in IPython. The `%run` command behaves like running a script directly from the command line (e.g., `python script.py`). This means you need to either:

1. **Change the current working directory** to the one containing your scripts using the `cd` command in IPython.
2. **Provide the full path** to the script when using the `%run` command.

Here's how you can do it:

### Changing the Current Working Directory
```python
import os
os.chdir('/path/to/your/scripts/directory')
%run my_script.py
```

### Providing the Full Path
```python
%run /path/to/your/scripts/directory/my_script.py
```

Regarding the issue with `sys.path` resetting after each kernel restart, this is expected behavior because `sys.path` is part of the Python runtime environment and is not persistent across sessions. If you need to modify `sys.path` frequently, you might consider adding the necessary paths in a startup script or configuration file for IPython.

For example, you can create an IPython startup script to automatically add your directory to `sys.path`:

1. Create a file named `00-my_startup.py` in the `~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/` directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist).
2. Add the following content to `00-my_startup.py`:
    ```python
    import sys
    sys.path.append('/path/to/your/scripts/directory')
    ```

This will ensure that your directory is always added to `sys.path` whenever you start a new IPython session.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
