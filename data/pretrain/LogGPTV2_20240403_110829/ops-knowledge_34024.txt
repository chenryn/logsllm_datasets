User: How to configure current limiting protection in Tomcat to protect web applications?
Assistant: There are many methods of current limiting protection in Tomcat, some of which are introduced below: 1. Using Valve valve current limiting In the Tomcat configuration file server.xml, you can limit the entire Tomcat instance by adding Valve valve current limiting. For example: ``` <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RequestRateValve" rate="100" capacity="10000" /> ``` where RequestRateValve represents the request rate valve, and the rate parameter represents the maximum request allowed Rate (number of requests per second), the capacity parameter indicates the maximum request queue length. When the number of requests exceeds the rate, the requests will be put into the queue, and when the queue length exceeds the capacity, new requests will be rejected. 2. Use Filter to limit the rate In web applications, you can use Filter to limit the rate of requests, for example: ``` public class RateLimiterFilter implements Filter { private static final int MAX_PERMITS = 100; private static final int RATE = 10; private RateLimiter rateLimiter; @Override public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException { rateLimiter = RateLimiter.create(RATE); } @Override public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException { if (rateLimiter. tryAcquire(MAX_PERMITS, 1, TimeUnit. SECONDS)) { chain. doFilter(request, response); } else { response. getWriter(). write("Too many requests, please try again later."); } } @Override public void destroy() { } } ``` In the above code, use RateLimiter in Google's Guava library to implement current limiting, MAX_PERMITS indicates the maximum number of requests allowed per second, RATE indicates the rate allowed per second, tryAcquire The method tries to obtain a permits license, returns true to indicate that the acquisition is successful, returns false to indicate that the acquisition fails, and then returns a response. 3. Use third-party current limiting plug-ins You can also use some third-party current limiting plug-ins, such as Apache's mod_evasive or Nginx's ngx_http_limit_req_module, these plug-ins can implement current limiting at the web server level and reduce the pressure on web applications.
