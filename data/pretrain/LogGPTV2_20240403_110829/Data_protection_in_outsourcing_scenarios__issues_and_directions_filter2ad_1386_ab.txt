### Server-Client and Client-Server Strategies
Server-Client and Client-Server strategies can be implemented without violating privacy. A potential performance-based strategy is to evaluate the most selective conditions first.

### Data Protection in Outsourcing Scenarios
**Minimal Fragmentation**
- The goal is to minimize the owner’s workload related to managing \( F_o \).
- A weight function \( w \) takes a pair \( (F_o, F_s) \) as input and returns the owner’s workload (i.e., storage and/or computational load).
- A fragmentation \( F = (F_o, F_s) \) is minimal if:
  1. \( F \) is correct (i.e., it satisfies the completeness, confidentiality, and non-redundancy properties).
  2. There does not exist another fragmentation \( F' \) such that \( w(F') < w(F) \) and \( F' \) is correct.

### Fragmentation Metrics
Different metrics can be applied to split attributes between \( F_o \) and \( F_s \), including:
- **Storage:**
  - Min-Attr: Minimize the number of attributes in \( F_o \).
  - Min-Size: Minimize the size of attributes in \( F_o \).
- **Computation/Traffic:**
  - Min-Query: Minimize the number of queries in which the owner needs to be involved.
  - Min-Cond: Minimize the number of conditions within queries in which the owner needs to be involved.

The choice of metrics depends on the available information.

### Modeling of the Minimization Problems
- All problems of minimizing storage or computation/traffic aim to identify a hitting set.
- \( F_o \) must contain at least one attribute for each constraint.
- Different metrics correspond to different criteria for minimizing the hitting set.
- The problem is to compute the hitting set of attributes with the minimum weight, which is an NP-hard problem.

### Fragments and Loose Associations
S. De Capitani di Vimercati, S. Foresti, S. Jajodia, S. Paraboschi, P. Samarati, “Fragments and Loose Associations: Respecting Privacy in Data Publishing,” in Proc. of the VLDB Endowment, vol. 3, no. 1, 2010.

### Data Publication
- Fragmentation can also be used to protect sensitive associations in data publishing by releasing only views (fragments) that do not expose sensitive associations.
- To increase the utility of published information, fragments can be coupled with some associations in sanitized form, known as loose associations, which are associations among groups of values rather than specific values.

### Loose Association
Given two fragments \( F_l \) and \( F_r \) containing sub-tuples involved in a sensitive association:
- Partition the tuples of \( F_l \) and \( F_r \) into different groups of size \( k_l \) and \( k_r \).
- Associations among tuples induce associations among groups.
- Ensure that the induced group associations guarantee a proper privacy degree.

### Example of Loose Association
Consider the following dataset:

| SSN          | Name  | Illness     | DoB       | Race    |
|--------------|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| 123-45-6789  | Nancy | hypertension| 65/12/07  | white   |
| 987-65-4321  | Ned   | gastritis   | 73/01/05  | black   |
| 963-85-2741  | Nell  | flu         | 86/03/31  | red     |
| 147-85-2369  | Nell  | asthma      | 90/07/19  | asian   |
| 782-90-5280  | Nick  | gastritis   | 55/05/22  | white   |
| 816-52-7272  | Nicole| obesity     | 32/11/22  | red     |
| 872-62-5178  | Noel  | measles     | 68/08/14  | asian   |
| 712-81-7618  | Norman| hypertension| 73/01/05  | hispanic|

Constraints:
- \( c_0 = \{SSN\} \)
- \( c_1 = \{Name, Illness\} \)
- \( c_2 = \{Name, DoB\} \)
- \( c_3 = \{Race, DoB, Illness\} \)

#### Fragmentation
- \( F_l \): Contains names and races.
- \( F_r \): Contains illnesses and dates of birth.

**Fragment \( F_l \)**:
| Name  | Race    |
|-------|---------|
| Nancy | white   |
| Ned   | black   |
| Nell  | red     |
| Nell  | asian   |
| Nick  | white   |
| Nicole| red     |
| Noel  | asian   |
| Norman| hispanic|

**Fragment \( F_r \)**:
| Illness     | DoB       |
|-------------|-----------|
| hypertension| 65/12/07  |
| gastritis   | 73/01/05  |
| flu         | 86/03/31  |
| asthma      | 90/07/19  |
| gastritis   | 55/05/22  |
| obesity     | 32/11/22  |
| measles     | 68/08/14  |
| hypertension| 73/01/05  |

By partitioning and grouping, we ensure that the associations among groups maintain a proper privacy level.

### Summary
- Loose associations provide a way to publish data while protecting sensitive information.
- The process involves partitioning and grouping data to ensure that the released information does not expose sensitive associations.
- This approach balances the need for data utility and privacy protection.
