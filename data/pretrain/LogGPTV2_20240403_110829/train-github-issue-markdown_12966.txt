Behat tests started failing because of this issue (see here).
The following command started displaying a help message, instead of running
the test suite:
    behat --no-colors -sbig_brother -fpretty --format-settings='{\"paths\": true}' features
The cause of the issue seems to be #24987 which allowed grouping short
options. `-sbig_brother` contains the "h" letter which is treated as `-h` and
the `Application` assumes it needs to display a help message:
