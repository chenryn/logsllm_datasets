Why are we here ? 
Passive Network Information Gathering 
•  Identify hosts/resources on a network 
•  Profile individuals/applications 
•  Determine network architecture 
•  Machine/domain/individual naming schemes 
Completely Silent 
•  No IP address required 
•  No Man-In-The-Middle required

Why are we here ? 
• 
Understand what is on your network 
• 
Deep Packet Parsing sounds like fun 
• 
Make this information easier for everyone to access 
• 
How to leverage this for pen tests 
• 
Waiting here for the next talk..

How will this help me? 
SysAdmin/User 
•  Know what traffic you are transmitting 
•  Are you tipping your hand by just being on the network ? 
Pen Tester 
•  Understand what information you can use to profile a network 
without anyone knowing you’re there 
Everyone 
•  Make this process easier 
•  Use Metasploit Database to help process/manage data 
•  Organize and manage results with Dradis 
•  How to stay quiet on a network

Talking is boring, show me 
Demo Time 
•  Demo 1 – Gathering Data 
•  Use Metasploit PIG modules to parse traffic and save data to the 
database 
•  Demo 2 – Viewing data with Metasploit 
•  Use Metasploit msfconsole to view collected data 
•  Demo 3 – Using Dradis to view information 
•  Import Metasploit data into Dradis to view data  
•  Demo 4 – PWN Plug and PIG

That’s neat, how does this work 
Metasploit framework plugin 
•  Core auxiliary module that handles sniffing 
Helper filters 
•  Series of individual filters that handle protocol parsing 
•  Each protocol sets sniffing parameters so that not everything 
goes to every filter 
Let’s take a look 
•  Demo time 
− Look at structure of building a simple parser

DHCP Inform 
•  Not completed yet, but 
•  Will pull out: 
− Mac address 
− Hostname 
− Vendor class 
− Request list 
•  Together can be used to guess OS and Service Pack

SSDP / Simple Service Discovery Protocol (UPNP) 
•  AKA Network Plug and Play 
•  Printers 
•  Cameras 
•  Network Gateways

How do we fix it 
Netbios 
•  Disable Netbios over TCP 
SSDP  
•  Disable network plug and play 
CDP 
•  Enable it only where needed 
DHCP 
•  DHCP Helpers can limit where these packets go 
Dropbox 
•  Disable LAN Sync 
Groove  
•  Haven’t found a way 
MDNS 
•  Disable it when possible, may not always be an option

How to help 
Need more data 
•  Broadcast and Multicast traffic only 
DHCP Host ID 
More protocols 
Copyright Trustwave 2010 
Future 
Add functionality to Meterpreter 
•  Meterpreter has sniffing capabilities, work on post module 
More protocols 
•  Collect data 
•  ??? 
•  Profit 
Better OS ID 
•  Improve guessing with DHCP
