#### Introduction
- **Ryan Linn**: Senior Security Consultant at Trustwave
  - Member of the SpiderLabs team at Trustwave
  - Contributor to Metasploit, BeEF, and other open-source projects
  - Interests:
    - Process streamlining through tool integration
    - Knowledge sharing
    - Metasploit
    - Making security knowledge accessible

---

#### Why are we here?
- **Passive Network Information Gathering**
  - Identify hosts and resources on a network
  - Profile individuals and applications
  - Determine network architecture
  - Analyze machine, domain, and individual naming schemes
- **Completely Silent**
  - No IP address required
  - No Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack needed

- **Objectives**
  - Understand what is on your network
  - Explore deep packet parsing
  - Make this information easily accessible
  - Leverage this for penetration testing
  - Provide valuable insights during downtime

---

#### How will this help me?
- **SysAdmin/User**
  - Know what traffic you are transmitting
  - Avoid inadvertently revealing sensitive information by just being on the network

- **Pen Tester**
  - Understand what information can be used to profile a network without detection

- **Everyone**
  - Simplify the process
  - Use the Metasploit Database to process and manage data
  - Organize and manage results with Dradis
  - Learn how to remain undetected on a network

---

#### Demonstration: Talking is boring, show me
- **Demo 1: Gathering Data**
  - Use Metasploit PIG modules to parse traffic and save data to the database
- **Demo 2: Viewing Data with Metasploit**
  - Use `msfconsole` to view collected data
- **Demo 3: Using Dradis to View Information**
  - Import Metasploit data into Dradis for visualization
- **Demo 4: PWN Plug and PIG**

---

#### Technical Details: That’s neat, how does this work?
- **Metasploit Framework Plugin**
  - Core auxiliary module that handles sniffing
  - Helper filters for protocol parsing
  - Each protocol sets sniffing parameters to ensure efficient processing

- **Demo Time**
  - Look at the structure of building a simple parser

---

#### Protocols and Plugins
- **Currently Supported Filters**
  - CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
  - DHCP Inform
  - Dropbox
  - Groove
  - MDNS
  - SMB
  - SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol)

- **CDP / Cisco Discovery Protocol**
  - OS Version
  - IP Address Information
  - VLAN Information
  - Management Interface Information
  - VOIP VLANs
  - Can aid in VLAN Hopping

- **DHCP Inform**
  - Mac Address
  - Hostname
  - Vendor Class
  - Request List
  - Can be used to guess OS and Service Pack

- **Dropbox**
  - Identify hosts using Dropbox
  - Dropbox Version
  - Dropbox Port
  - Shared Namespaces

- **Groove**
  - Online/Offline Status
  - Groove Port
  - All Addresses on the System (useful for identifying VMs and linking hosts)
  - Groove Version

- **MDNS**
  - List Open Ports
  - IP Addresses
  - People's Names
  - Active State of Machine
  - Available Functionality

- **SMB**
  - Host OS Version
  - Server/Client Status
  - Hostname
  - Domain Name
  - SQL Server Detection

- **SSDP / Simple Service Discovery Protocol (UPNP)**
  - AKA Network Plug and Play
  - Printers
  - Cameras
  - Network Gateways

---

#### Remediation
- **Netbios**
  - Disable Netbios over TCP
- **SSDP**
  - Disable network plug and play
- **CDP**
  - Enable only where necessary
- **DHCP**
  - Use DHCP Helpers to limit packet distribution
- **Dropbox**
  - Disable LAN Sync
- **Groove**
  - Currently, no known method to disable
- **MDNS**
  - Disable when possible

---

#### How to Help
- **Need More Data**
  - Focus on broadcast and multicast traffic
  - DHCP Host ID
  - Additional protocols

---

#### Future
- **Add Functionality to Meterpreter**
  - Utilize Meterpreter's sniffing capabilities
  - Develop post-exploitation modules
- **More Protocols**
  - Collect data
  - Improve functionality
  - Generate value
- **Better OS Identification**
  - Enhance guessing with DHCP
