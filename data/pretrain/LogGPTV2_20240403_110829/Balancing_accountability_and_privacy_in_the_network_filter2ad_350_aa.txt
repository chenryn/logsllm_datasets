ABSTRACT
Though most would agree that accountability and privacy
are both valuable, today’s Internet provides little support for
either. Previous eﬀorts have explored ways to oﬀer stronger
guarantees for one of the two, typically at the expense of
the other; indeed, at ﬁrst glance accountability and privacy
appear mutually exclusive. At the center of the tussle is
the source address:
in an accountable Internet, source ad-
dresses undeniably link packets and senders so hosts can be
punished for bad behavior. In a privacy-preserving Internet,
source addresses are hidden as much as possible.
In this paper, we argue that a balance is possible. We
introduce the Accountable and Private Internet Protocol
(APIP), which splits source addresses into two separate ﬁelds
— an accountability address and a return address — and in-
troduces independent mechanisms for managing each. Ac-
countability addresses, rather than pointing to hosts, point
to accountability delegates, which agree to vouch for packets
on their clients’ behalves, taking appropriate action when
misbehavior is reported. With accountability handled by
delegates, senders are now free to mask their return ad-
dresses; we discuss a few techniques for doing so.

INTRODUCTION
Today’s Internet is caught in a tussle [13] between service
providers, who want accountability, and users, who want pri-
vacy. Each side has legitimate arguments: if senders cannot
be held accountable for their traﬃc (e.g., source addresses
are spoofable), stopping in-progress attacks and preventing
future ones becomes next to impossible. On the other hand,

there are legitimate anonymous uses of the Internet, such
as accessing medical web sites without revealing personal
medical conditions, posting to whistleblowing web sites, or
speaking out against an oppressive political regime.
At the network layer, mechanisms for providing one or
the other often boil down to either strengthening or weak-
ening source addresses. In an accountable Internet, source
addresses undeniably link packets and senders so miscreants
can be punished for bad behavior, so techniques like egress
ﬁltering and unicast reverse path forwarding (uRPF) checks
aim to prevent spooﬁng. In a private Internet, senders hide
source addresses as much as possible, so services like Tor
work by masking the sender’s true source address.
We argue that striking a balance between accountability
and privacy is fundamentally diﬃcult because the IP source
address is used both to to identify the sender (accountabil-
ity) and as a return address (privacy). In fact, the function
of the source address has evolved to be even more complex,
serving a total of ﬁve distinct roles: packet sender, return ad-
dress, error reporting (e.g., for ICMP), accountability (e.g.,
uRPF), and to calculate a ﬂow ID (e.g., as part of the stan-
dard 5-tuple).
This paper asks the question, “What could we do if the
accountability and return address roles were separated?”
Our answer, the Accountable and Private Internet Protocol
(APIP), does just that, creating an opportunity for a more
ﬂexible approach to balancing accountability and privacy in
the network. APIP utilizes the accountability address in a
privacy-preserving way by introducing the notion of dele-
gated accountability, in which a trusted third party vouches
for packets and ﬁelds complaints. With accountability han-
dled by delegates, senders have more freedom to hide return
addresses. We make the following contributions:

address and the accompanying mechanisms for holding

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. After
teasing apart the various roles of the source address (§2), §3
discusses challenges in balancing accountability and privacy.
§4 gives a high-level overview of APIP. §5 describes possible
designs for delegated accountability while §6 analyzes their
implications for privacy. §7 discusses real-world deployment
issues and presents two example end-to-end instantiations of
APIP. We evaluate the feasibility of APIP in §8 and ﬁnish
with a discussion of related work (§9) and conclusion (§10).
2. SOURCE ADDRESS OVERLOAD
We now investigate the roles of source addresses, since
they play a key role in the seemingly fundamental conﬂict
between accountability and privacy in the network. Source
addresses today attempt to fulﬁll at least ﬁve distinct roles:
1) Return Address — This is a source address’s most
obvious role: the receiving application uses the source
address as the destination for responses. (This is, for
example, built into TCP connection establishment.)
2) Sender Identity — Historically, source addresses
have been used as a crude (and ineﬀective) way of
authenticating a sender or to link multiple sessions to
a single “user.”
3) Error Reporting — If a packet encounters a
problem, the ICMP error message is directed to the
source address.
4) Flow ID — Source addresses are one component of
the 5-tuple used to classify packets into ﬂows, both in
the network (monitoring, traﬃc engineering) and at
endpoints (demultiplexing).
5) Accountability — Techniques such as uRPF checks
and egress ﬁltering can be viewed as weak
accountability mechanisms protecting against certain
types of address spooﬁng. Recent work oﬀers
stronger protection than that oﬀered by IP. For
example, AIP [4] uses cryptographic identiﬁers as
source addresses that can be used to verify that the
host identiﬁed really did send the packet.
Somewhat to our surprise, many proposed architectures
use source addresses for the same purposes. This includes
proposals that are very diﬀerent from IP, such as architec-
tures that use paths or capabilities, rather than addresses, to
identify a destination. For instance, SCION [37] headers in-
clude AS-level paths selected jointly by the ISPs and source
and destination networks to specify how to reach the desti-
nation. However, each packet still has an AIP-style source
identiﬁer that fulﬁlls the above roles. Also, in ICING [28]
and capability-based architectures such as TVA [36], pack-
ets carry pre-approved router-level paths, but they also carry
traditional source and destination addresses.
To understand the impact of repurposing the source ad-
dress as an accountability address in APIP, we ask two ques-
tions about each role:
(1) Is it needed by the network? If not, it can be moved
deeper in the packet, opening up more design options and
simplifying the network header.
(2) Is it needed in every packet? If not, it could be
stored elsewhere, e.g., on the routers or end-hosts that will
use it. This simpliﬁes the packet header, but may add com-
plexity to protocols that have to maintain the state.
Table 1 summarizes the answers to these questions. Two
high-level takeaways emerge: (1) not all roles involve the
network, and (2) some information is not needed in every
packet. The following observations are particularly relevant
to the accountability versus privacy tussle:
1) The accountability role is the network’s
primary use of source addresses. Error reporting
beneﬁts the host, not the network. Hosts could
choose to forgo error reports for the sake of privacy
or have them sent to the accountability address. Flow
ID calculation could use the accountability address.
2) The return address role is not used by the
network at all. It could be moved deeper in the
packet, encrypted end-to-end, and/or omitted after
the ﬁrst packet of a ﬂow.
3. ACCOUNTABILITY VERSUS PRIVACY
A number of research eﬀorts focus on improving either
accountability or sender privacy in the network, but unfor-
tunately this often comes at the price of weakening the other.
To illustrate this point, we summarize one well-known tech-
nique for each and then elaborate on the goals of this paper.
3.1 Previous Work
Accountability and Nothing But The Accountable In-
ternet Protocol (AIP) [4] is a network architecture whose
primary objective is accountability. Each host’s endpoint
identiﬁer (EID) is the cryptographic hash of its public key,
and AIP introduces two mechanisms that use these “self-
certifying” EIDs to hold hosts accountable.
First, ﬁrst-hop routers in AIP prevent spooﬁng by period-
ically “challenging” a host by returning the hash of a packet
it purportedly sent. Hosts maintain a cache of hashes of
recently sent packets and respond aﬃrmatively if they ﬁnd
the speciﬁed packet hash; the response is signed with the
private key corresponding to the source EID. If a challenge
elicits no response or the response has an invalid signature,
the router drops the original packet. Second, AIP proposes a
shutoﬀ protocol: a victim under attack sends the attacking
host a shutoﬀ packet, prompting the attacker’s NIC to install
a ﬁlter blocking the oﬀending ﬂow. Shutoﬀ packets contain
the hash of an attack packet (to prove the host really sent
something to the victim) and are signed with the victim’s
private key (to prove the shutoﬀ came from the victim).
AIP suﬀers from three important limitations: ﬁrst, cryp-
tographically linking senders to their packets’ source ad-
dresses precludes any possibility of privacy. Second, though
bad behavior is always linkable to the misbehaving host,
AIP does not facilitate a long-term ﬁx—the shutoﬀ proto-
col is only a stop-gap measure. Finally, AIP requires that
well-intentioned owners install “smart NICs” that implement
the challenge and shutoﬀ protocols, since a compromised OS
could ignore shutoﬀs. We draw heavily on ideas from AIP
while addressing these limitations.
Privacy and Nothing But The best available solution
for hiding a return address is using a mix net or onion rout-
ing service like Tor [12, 31, 32]. Observers in the network
only see the identity of the two onion routers on that link
in the Tor path. Of course, accountability is much more
diﬃcult to achieve since the identity of the sender is hidden
inside the packet, behind one or more layers of encryption.
Liu et al. propose an architecture that oﬀers a high degree
of privacy by baking Tor into the network itself [25]. How-
ever, in addition to the lack of accountability, the increased
header overhead and latency make Tor unsuitable as a de-
fault, “always-on” solution.

3.2 Goals
The examples show that the source address represents a
control point in the tussle between privacy and accountabil-
ity. Unfortunately, it is a very crude one since there seem
to be only two settings: privacy (x)or accountability. The
high level goal of this paper is to redeﬁne the source address
so it can properly balance the accountability and privacy
concerns of providers and users.
Accountability At the network layer, by accountability
we mean that hosts cannot send traﬃc with impunity:
malicious behavior can be stopped and perpetrators can be
