 **Kenny MacLeod** opened **SPR-4567** and commented
The exposeContextBeansAsAttributes property of InternalResourceView, while
useful, is often a bit too wide-ranging in its effects. Sometimes you get a
clash between bean names and JSP scoped variables which can be very hard to
track down.
Could InternalResourceView be modified so that a specific collection of beans
could be explicitly exposed as JSP attributes, rather than every one of them?
These would be injected into the InternalResourceViewResolver by name or
reference.
