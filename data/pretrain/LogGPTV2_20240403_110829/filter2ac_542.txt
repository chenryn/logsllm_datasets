**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

Regularly audit domain and local accounts, along with their permission levels, to identify potential situations where an adversary could gain broad access by obtaining the credentials of a privileged account. [8] [9] These audits should also check for the presence of enabled default accounts and unauthorized new local accounts. 

Adhere to best practices for the design and administration of an enterprise network to minimize the use of privileged accounts across different administrative tiers. [10] Specifically, limit access to the root account and prevent users from modifying protected system components through proper privilege separation mechanisms (e.g., SELinux, grsecurity, AppArmor). Additionally, reduce opportunities for privilege escalation.

For hybrid identity solutions, restrict on-premises accounts that have access to the solution. For example, limit Azure AD Global Administrator accounts to only those that are essential, and ensure these accounts are dedicated cloud-only accounts rather than hybrid ones. [5]

This approach will help in maintaining a secure environment and reducing the risk of unauthorized access and privilege abuse.
