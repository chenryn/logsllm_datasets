User: Will someone please give a clear, precise, repeatable method of linking a brewed Python 3 with the correct tcl-tk for a Mac OS?
I am NOT a power user.
I received an answer to this question from a homebrew contributor, but that answer no longer works.
Assistant: flagging python3 on install '--with-tcl-tk' works, but the idle3 launch needs to be linked to it using brew linkapps python3.
thereafter, the warning caveat which accompanies idle3 launch disappears.
I hope this helps other users.
