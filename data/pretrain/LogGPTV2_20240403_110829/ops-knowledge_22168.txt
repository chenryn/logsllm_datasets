User: Please provide a disk space cleanup script under Linux system, which runs automatically once a week.
Assistant: The following is a basic disk space cleaning script under Linux system, which can be run automatically once a week: ```shell #!/bin/bash # Set variable LOG_DIR=/var/log ROOT_UID=0 LINES=50 E_XCD=86 E_NOTROOT =87 # Check to run as root if [ "$UID" -ne "$ROOT_UID" ] then echo "Must be root to run this script." exit $E_NOTROOT fi # Clean up log files cd $LOG_DIR || { echo " Cannot change to necessary directory." >&2 exit $E_XCD } # Clear the content of the log file cat /dev/null > messages cat /dev/null > wtmp echo "Logs cleaned up." exit 0 ``` Save the script as a file (e.g. `clean_logs.sh`), and add it to the cron job of the Linux system to run automatically every week: ```bash sudo crontab -e ``` Then add the following: ``` 0 0 * * 0 /path/to/clean_logs.sh ``` This will run the script and clean the log files every Sunday at midnight (i.e. the first day of the week).
