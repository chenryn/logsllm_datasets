**Issue: Running Python in Interactive Mode within Windows PowerShell**

I am trying to run `python.exe` in interactive mode within Windows PowerShell. I have added `C:\Python27` to my system's `PATH` environment variable. However, when I type `python` in the PowerShell, a new Command Prompt window opens and runs Python there, instead of running it directly within PowerShell. This is problematic because commands like `python --version` launch a new Command Prompt window that closes immediately, making it impossible to read the output.

**Note:** This issue started after I installed `pip`, `easy_install`, and `virtualenv` this morning. 

**Question:**
Does anyone know how to configure Python to run interactively within PowerShell?

**Response:**

While I'm not an expert in PowerShell, I can share a method that has worked for me with Python 2.7.3. Hereâ€™s what you can try:

1. **Navigate to the Python Installation Directory:**
   Open PowerShell and navigate to your Python installation directory. For example:
   ```powershell
   PS C:\> cd C:\Python27
   ```

2. **Run Python Interactively:**
   Execute the Python interpreter by using the relative path to the `python.exe` file:
   ```powershell
   PS C:\Python27> .\python
   ```

   This should start the Python interpreter in interactive mode directly within PowerShell. You should see something like:
   ```
   Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:31:26) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> 
   ```

If you want to run Python from any directory without navigating to `C:\Python27`, ensure that the `C:\Python27` directory is correctly added to your `PATH` environment variable. You can check and modify the `PATH` variable using the following steps:

1. **Check Current `PATH`:**
   ```powershell
   PS C:\> $env:PATH
   ```

2. **Add Python to `PATH` (if not already added):**
   ```powershell
   PS C:\> $env:PATH += ";C:\Python27"
   ```

3. **Verify Python Version:**
   After ensuring the `PATH` is correctly set, you can verify the Python version:
   ```powershell
   PS C:\> python --version
   ```

This should display the Python version directly in the PowerShell window without opening a new Command Prompt.

If the issue persists, it might be related to the recent installations of `pip`, `easy_install`, and `virtualenv`. You may need to check if these tools have modified any environment settings or created conflicting scripts.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
