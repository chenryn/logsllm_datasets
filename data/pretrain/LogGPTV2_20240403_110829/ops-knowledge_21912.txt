User: I am trying to get python.exe to run in interactive mode in windows powershell. I have added c:\python27 to my PATH and when I type "python" in into the shell a new command prompt window opens running python, rather than running within powershell. This is a problem as when I run things like "python --version" it launches the new command prompt window and then closes before I can read it. Does anyone know how to get python to run in powershell?
Note: this used to work before I started to install pip, easy_install and virtualenv this morning.
Thanks
Assistant: I'm not expert in PS, but when I need to use python in interactive mode in windows powershell, I use something like this (version of python is 2.7.3, I didn't change env variables):
PS C:\Python27> ./python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:31:26) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
