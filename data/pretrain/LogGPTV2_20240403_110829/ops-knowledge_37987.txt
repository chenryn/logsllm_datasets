User: I have installed both versions of python that is python 2.7 and python 3.5.3. When I run python command in command prompt, python 3.5.3 interpreter shows up. How can I switch to python 2.7 interpreter?
Assistant: If you use Windows OS:
py -2.7 for python 2.7
py -3 for python 3.x
But first you need to check your PATH
