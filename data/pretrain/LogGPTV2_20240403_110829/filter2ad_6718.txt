**Title: Incentives for Disclosure of Vulnerabilities in the Security Market**

**Author: Peter P. Swire, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA**

**Abstract:**

In a previous paper, the author introduced a model to evaluate when the disclosure of vulnerabilities enhances or hinders security. The model also highlighted key differences between computer and physical security in this context. This current paper delves into the incentives that drive actors to disclose or withhold information about vulnerabilities.

The primary argument of this paper is that the decision to disclose vulnerabilities is influenced by two largely independent factors: the impact of disclosure on security and the competitive advantages or disadvantages it may confer on an organization.

To illustrate these dynamics, the paper presents a 2x3 matrix that assesses the motivations for disclosure in three types of systems: open-source software, proprietary software, and government systems. Surprisingly, the analysis reveals significant convergence in disclosure practices between open-source and proprietary software. For example, open-source security experts often refrain from disclosing configurations and settings, and open-source developers frequently rely on trade secrets to gain a competitive edge. Similarly, proprietary software companies tend to be more transparent than commonly assumed, as market forces and the desire to establish industry standards often lead to greater disclosure.

Despite the observed similarities in disclosure practices between open-source and proprietary software, government systems exhibit a different pattern. The culture of military secrecy and the fear of alerting potential attackers contribute to a general reluctance to share information about vulnerabilities. Additionally, inter-agency competition, such as the FBI's historical resistance to sharing information with local law enforcement, further diminishes the incentives for transparency.
