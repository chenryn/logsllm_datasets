Abstract 
A previous paper by the author proposed a model  for  when disclosure helps or hurts security, and 
provided reasons why computer security is often different in this respect than physical security.  This 
paper examines the incentives of actors to disclose vulnerabilities.  A chief point of this paper is that 
the incentives of disclosure depend on two, largely independent, assessments – the degree to which 
disclosure  helps  or  hurts  security,  and  the  degree  to  which  disclosure  creates  advantages  or 
disadvantages for the organization competitively. 
The paper presents a 2x3 matrix, where disclosure for security and competition are assessed for three 
types  of  systems  or  software:  Open  Source;  proprietary  software;  and  government  systems.  
Surprisingly,  the  paper  finds  significant  convergence  on  disclosure  between  Open  Source  and 
proprietary software. For instance, Open Source security experts often do not disclose configurations 
and settings, and Open Source programmers often rely on trade secrets (i.e., lack of disclosure) to gain 
competitive advantage. Similarly, proprietary software often uses more disclosure than assumed.  For 
security, large purchasers and market forces often lead to disclosure about proprietary software.  For 
competitive reasons, proprietary software  companies often disclose a great deal in order to seek to 
become a standard in a competitive space. 
Despite this greater-than-expected convergence of practice for Open Source and proprietary software, 
there are strong reasons to believe that less-than-optimal disclosure happens for government systems.  
The tradition of  military  secrecy, and the concern  about tipping off  attackers, leads to a  culture of 
secrecy for government security.  Competition for turf, such as the FBI’s reputation for not sharing 
with  local  law  enforcement,  further  reduces  agency  incentives  to  share  information  about 
vulnerabilities.
