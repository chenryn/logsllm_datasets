When I expand a collapsible navbar and after that resize the browser window,
the navbar-collapse element keeps the class "in". In my opinion the class "in"
should be removed if the width is wide enough for the navbar not to be
collapsed because when I call the page with a wide browser the navbar-collapse
also does not get the "in" class.
