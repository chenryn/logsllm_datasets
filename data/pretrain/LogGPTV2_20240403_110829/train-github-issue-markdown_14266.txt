### Vue.js version
2.0.5
### Reproduction Link
https://jsfiddle.net/e2c6y887/2/
### Steps to reproduce
Click on 'test2'
### What is Expected?
Test1 link should not have 'active' class and thus no red color.  
The reason I'd want to combine class and v-bind:class (with both 'active'
class) is, that the initial active class is added by JSP code and the second
by Vue. If I don't have this initial class logic, the button gets the 'Vue
active class' to late which causes a not very nice jump in the page.
### What is actually happening?
Both test1 and test2 have 'active' class and are 'red'.  
When clicking 'test1' again, and inspect the element, 'test1' have 2 'active'
classes instead of one.
With Vue1 it works a bit different: https://jsfiddle.net/pfu2dw3j/1/  
When clicking 'test2' both links have 'active' class. When clicking test 1 and
test 2 again, it works correct from that point.
Do I use it wrong, or is it a bug?
