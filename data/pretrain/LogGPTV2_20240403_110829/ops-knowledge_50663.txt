Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system receiving and storing blocks of data. The DataNode components receive blocks of size 67108864 from various IP addresses, and the FSNamesystem component updates the blockMap with the IP address and size of the block. In one instance, the FSNamesystem component also allocated a block.
