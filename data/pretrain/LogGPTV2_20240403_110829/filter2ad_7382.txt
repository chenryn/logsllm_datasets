1   Introduction 
Monitoring high-speed networks for a long period of time produces a high volume of 
data, making the storage of this information practically inefficient. To this end, there 
is a need to derive an efficient method of data analysis and reduction in order to ar-
chive and store the enormous amount of monitored traffic.  
Satisfying  this  need  is  useful  not  only  for  administrators  but  also  for  researchers 
who run their experiments on the monitored network. The researchers would like to 
know  how  their  experiments  affect  the  network's  behavior  in  terms  of  utilization, 
delay, packet loss, data rate etc.  
In this paper a method of compressing computer network measurements while pre-
serving  the  quality  in  interesting  signal  characteristics  is  presented.  Eight  different 
mother wavelets are compared against each other in order to examine which one of-
fers  the  best  results  in  terms  of  quality  in  the  reconstructed  signal.  The  proposed 
wavelet  compression  algorithm  is  compared  against  the  lossless  compression  tool 
bzip2 in terms of compression ratio (C.R.). Finally, practical results are presented by 
compressing sampled traffic recorded from a live network.  
2   Methodology 
Wavelet analysis is not a compression tool but a transformation to a domain that pro-
vides a different view of the data that is more eligible to compression than the original 
data itself. This happens because small wavelet coefficients can be discarded without 
a  significant  loss  in  the  quality  of  the  signal.  On  the  other  hand,  large  coefficients 
represent important characteristics of the signal and they should be kept.  
Gupta and Kaur [1] proposed an adaptive thresholding technique that is calculated 
from the value of the wavelet coefficients. This scheme is not based on signal denois-
ing but rather tries to statistically identify significant coefficients.  
Afterwards, normalization and run length encoding are applied. For the simulation 
experiments  thirty  delay  and  thirty  data  rate  signals  of  1024  points  were  used.  The 
delay  signals  were  measured  over  the  test  bed  of  High  Speed  Networks  (HSN)  re-
search group. The data rate signals are from a real commercial network.

3   Wavelet Comparison 
Eight  wavelets  were  chosen  and  compared  against  each  other  in  order  to  find  out 
which  one  offers  better  reconstruction  results.  The  following  wavelets  were  com-
pared:  Haar,  Meyer,  Biorthogonal  3.9  and  Daubechies  D4,  D6,  D8,  D10,  D12. The 
index  of  Daubechies  wavelets  indicates  the  number  of  coefficients.  The  number  of 
vanishing moments each Daubechies wavelet has is half of the number of coefficients. 
Wavelets  with  many  vanishing  moments  are  described  with  many  coefficients  in 
the  scaling  and  wavelet  functions,  thus  increasing  the  computation  overhead  of  the 
wavelet transform, the complexity of the algorithm and the output file size. Table 1 
shows the average PSNR value after reconstruction at level 6 for thirty delay and data 
rate signals.

Data Rate 
The  Haar  wavelet  provides  higher  PSNR  values  for  the  reconstructed  signals  in 
both delay and data rate signals and has the following advantages: It is conceptually 
simple, fast, memory efficient and exactly reversible without producing edge effects.

 4   Simulation Results 
Fig. 1a shows a delay signal, before and after the compression. Because the two sig-
nals  are  very  similar,  the  error  between  them  is  also  provided  for  better  judgment 
(lower  line).  The  signal  is  decomposed  at  level  10  and  the  reconstruction  quality  is 
37.85 dB while the C.R. is 13.7. PSNR values less than 35 dB loose some of the im-
portant signal characteristics  while PSNR  values less than 30 dB are not acceptable 
for such signals. 
Fig. 1b shows a more interesting case of a data rate signal. This signal includes a 
spike,  which  is  kept  intact  after  the  compression.  A  characteristic  of  the  proposed 
algorithm is that it detects the spike as a more interesting feature than the rest of the 
signal. As a result, the algorithm’s first priority becomes to preserve this characteristic 
and then comes the rest of the signal. The PSNR is 35 dB and the C.R.= 26.57. 
Fig. 2 compares the C.R. results of the suggested wavelet technique against bzip2. 
It is interesting to examine the results from wavelet transform against a non-transform 
compression technique. In average, for delay signals (Fig. 2a) the suggested method 
(WT) achieves compression 6.5 times more than bzip2 with the best score being 11 
times and the worst score 2.3 times. For data rate signals (Fig. 2b) the average com-
pression is 4.7 times more than bzip2 with the best score being 12 times and the worst 
4 times.

5   Practical Results 
The  full  algorithm  is  already  implemented  in  CoMo.  CoMo  is  a  passive  monitoring 
platform  developed  for  the  purpose  of  monitoring  network  links  at  high  speeds  and 
replying  to  real-time  queries  regarding  network  statistics.  CoMo  has  various  modules 
that  each  calculates  one  or  more  network  measurements  [2].  The  proposed  algorithm 
can be imbedded in the  modules and compress  these  measurements. When  CoMo re-
ceives a query, the information is first decompressed and then shown to the end user. 
The  experiment  lasted  for  8  days  and  CoMo  was  monitoring  traffic  recorded  at 
HSN research group’s live network. The overall achieved compression is 34.5 times. 
Fig. 3 presents a  segment of  34  minutes  from the 8 days  duration experiment. This 
signal is characterized by discrete bursts of data rate. Some have amplitude of 70 kB/s 
while others are half that size or less. The reconstruction keeps intact the peaks and 
smoothes  out  the  relatively  small  variation  of  the  signal.  PSNR  for  that  segment  is 
55.9 dB.

6   Conclusions – Future Work 
This paper proposes the use of wavelet analysis techniques along with a wavelet coeffi-
cient  thresholding  method  for  compressing  computer  network  measurements  such  as 
data rate and delay. Even though the compression is lossy, the important characteristics 
of the examined  signal are preserved. In order to increase  the compression, the detail 
characteristics are smoothed out by discarding the corresponding detail coefficients. 
An  evaluation  of  various  wavelets  with  increasing  vanishing  moments  was  pre-
sented  in  order  to  determine  which  wavelet  is  more  appropriate  for  performing  the 
analysis. From simulation results, the Haar wavelet is found to be the best option as it 
offers the best results in terms of quality and compression ratio. 
However,  some  improvements  should  be  done  in  how  the  algorithm  deals  with  the 
threshold in cases that spikes occur in an already bursty signal like in signal 16 (Fig. 1b). 
This  would  lead  to  more  control  over  the  quality  of  the  reconstructed  signal  and  more 
consistent PSNR values.
