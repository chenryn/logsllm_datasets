## 1. Introduction
Long-term monitoring of high-speed networks generates a large volume of data, making storage inefficient. An effective method for analyzing and reducing this data is essential for both network administrators and researchers. Researchers need to understand the impact of their experiments on network behavior, including utilization, delay, packet loss, and data rate.

This paper presents a method for compressing computer network measurements while preserving key signal characteristics. Eight different mother wavelets are compared to determine which provides the best reconstruction quality. The proposed wavelet compression algorithm is also compared with the lossless compression tool bzip2 in terms of compression ratio (C.R.). Practical results are demonstrated by compressing sampled traffic from a live network.

## 2. Methodology
Wavelet analysis transforms data into a domain that is more amenable to compression. Small wavelet coefficients can be discarded without significantly degrading the signal quality, while large coefficients, representing important signal features, are retained.

Gupta and Kaur [1] proposed an adaptive thresholding technique based on the statistical identification of significant coefficients. This method is not focused on denoising but rather on identifying and retaining important signal features. After thresholding, normalization and run-length encoding are applied.

For the simulation, thirty delay and thirty data rate signals, each consisting of 1024 points, were used. The delay signals were measured over the test bed of the High Speed Networks (HSN) research group, and the data rate signals were from a real commercial network.

## 3. Wavelet Comparison
Eight wavelets were compared to determine which provided the best reconstruction results: Haar, Meyer, Biorthogonal 3.9, and Daubechies D4, D6, D8, D10, and D12. The index of Daubechies wavelets indicates the number of coefficients, with the number of vanishing moments being half of the number of coefficients. Wavelets with many vanishing moments have higher computational overhead, complexity, and output file size.

Table 1 shows the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values after reconstruction at level 6 for the delay and data rate signals.

| Wavelet | PSNR (dB) - Delay | PSNR (dB) - Data Rate |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Haar    | 39.60             | 55.16                 |
| D4      | 38.25             | 54.06                 |
| D6      | 37.65             | 53.99                 |
| D8      | 37.47             | 53.02                 |
| D10     | 37.05             | 50.69                 |
| D12     | 36.97             | 52.59                 |
| Meyer   | 37.08             | 54.91                 |
| Bio3.9  | 37.35             | 51.72                 |

The Haar wavelet provides the highest PSNR values for both delay and data rate signals. It is conceptually simple, fast, memory-efficient, and exactly reversible without producing edge effects.

## 4. Simulation Results
Figure 1a shows a delay signal before and after compression. The decomposed signal at level 10 has a PSNR of 37.85 dB and a C.R. of 13.7. PSNR values below 35 dB lose important signal characteristics, and values below 30 dB are unacceptable.

Figure 1b shows a data rate signal with a spike, which is preserved after compression. The algorithm prioritizes preserving such features, resulting in a PSNR of 35 dB and a C.R. of 26.57.

Figure 2 compares the C.R. results of the wavelet technique against bzip2. For delay signals, the wavelet method achieves an average compression 6.5 times greater than bzip2, with the best and worst scores being 11 and 2.3 times, respectively. For data rate signals, the average compression is 4.7 times greater, with the best and worst scores being 12 and 4 times, respectively.

## 5. Practical Results
The full algorithm is implemented in CoMo, a passive monitoring platform for high-speed network links. CoMo modules calculate various network measurements, and the proposed algorithm can be embedded to compress these measurements. When CoMo receives a query, the information is first decompressed and then displayed to the user.

An experiment lasting 8 days monitored traffic from the HSN research group's live network, achieving an overall compression of 34.5 times. Figure 3 shows a 34-minute segment with discrete bursts of data rate, where the peaks are preserved and small variations are smoothed out. The PSNR for this segment is 55.9 dB.

## 6. Conclusions and Future Work
This paper proposes using wavelet analysis and coefficient thresholding for compressing computer network measurements. Despite being lossy, the compression preserves important signal characteristics. The Haar wavelet was found to be the best option, offering the best quality and compression ratio.

Future work should focus on improving the algorithm's handling of spikes in bursty signals, leading to better control over the reconstructed signal quality and more consistent PSNR values.
