User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows server 2016 Security Log - Remove extra description text? Preface once again: I'm a Linux admin.

Is there any way to reduce the verbosity of Windows Server Security Log messages? For example, every logon event "4624" has this extra text describing what a logon event is. Yes, I know what a logon event is. At this point I even know what event ID 4624 is. And if I don't, I can just look up the details.

Example:

    Computer = "dc1.example.com";
    EventCode = 4624;
    EventIdentifier = 4624;
    Logfile = "Security";
...snip...
...
...useful info...
...THIS:
This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate etc etc etc etc - 1.6k worth!!


All the extra verbosity is crushing my logging service!

I've found exactly one other person on the internet with this problem, which I find very surprising! I'd prefer a Windows-native solution.

Assistant: All Windows events exist in two formats: Xml, and Rendered Text. Usually you only need the Xml data. If the Sumo collectors are configured to send Rendered Text (seems like it), 80% of your log data is useless redundant junk.

The "renderMessages" setting seems applicable. default: True

Flag indicating if full event messages are collected (true) or just core event metadata (false)
