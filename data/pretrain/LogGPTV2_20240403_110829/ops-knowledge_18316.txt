User: In order to strengthen the security of the server, it is necessary to set a simple firewall rule to restrict access to certain ports, please provide a firewall configuration scheme suitable for Linux environment.
Assistant: The following is an example firewall configuration scheme: 1. Use the iptables command to set firewall rules. 2. Manually specify the port number and protocol type (TCP or UDP) that need to be allowed to access. 3. By default, all other ports are denied access. 4. You can set whitelist (list of IP addresses allowed to visit) or blacklist (list of IP addresses forbidden to visit). 5. After the configuration is complete, save the rule. The following is an example command: #Allow TCP connections on ports 80 and 443 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT #Allow UDP on port 53 Connection iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT #Reject all other connections iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT #Allow access to the computer with IP address 1.2.3.4 iptables -A INPUT -s 1.2.3.4 -j ACCEPT #Prohibit access to the computer with IP address 5.6.7.8 iptables -A INPUT -s 5.6.7.8 -j DROP #Save rules iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables The above command sets the allowed access to ports 80, 443 and 53, and rejects All other connections, and the computer with IP address 1.2.3.4 is allowed to access, and the computer with IP address 5.6.7.8 is prohibited from accessing. Note that the above examples are only for reference, and the specific firewall rules need to be set and adjusted according to the actual situation.
