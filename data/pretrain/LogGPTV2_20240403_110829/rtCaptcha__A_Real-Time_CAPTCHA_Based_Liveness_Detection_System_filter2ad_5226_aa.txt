## Abstract
rtCaptcha is a real-time liveness detection system that leverages CAPTCHA-based challenges to enhance the security of face authentication systems. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of rtCaptcha, along with a comprehensive analysis of its security and usability.

## 1. Introduction
Face authentication systems are widely deployed by major companies, including Microsoft Cognitive Services, Amazon Rekognition, Face++, and Kairos Human Analytics. However, these systems are vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as still image, video replay, 3D mask, and deep learning-based attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose rtCaptcha, a novel liveness detection system that integrates real-time CAPTCHA challenges to ensure the authenticity of the user.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Face Authentication Systems
Face authentication systems have become increasingly popular due to their convenience and ease of use. These systems rely on advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to verify the identity of users. Despite their advantages, they are susceptible to a range of sophisticated attacks.

### 2.2 Threat Model
The threat model for rtCaptcha includes automated compromising attacks where:
- The camera, microphone, and device kernel are compromised.
- There is no form of attestation.
- The client-server protocol is known.
- State-of-the-art synthesizers and CAPTCHA breaking tools are available.
- The authentication server is not compromised.

### 2.3 Examples of Compromising Attacks
#### Example-1: 3D Model Fitting
A malicious app can capture raw material, such as the victim's face, and fit a 3D model to it. This 3D model can then be used in a virtual reality environment to answer CAPTCHA challenges in real-time. This attack was demonstrated by Xu et al. in "VirtualU" (Usenix'16).

#### Example-2: Accessorize to a Crime
Sharif et al. demonstrated in "Accessorize to a Crime" (CCS'16) how an attacker can create a perturber, such as eyeglasses, to impersonate a victim. This attack achieved 100% success in fooling Face++.

## 3. Security of Current Systems
### 3.1 Face Verification Cloud Services
We evaluated the security of leading face verification cloud services, including:
- Microsoft Cognitive Services
- Amazon Rekognition
- Face++
- Kairos Human Analytics

#### Attack Vector
- **Database:** The first 10 subjects from the CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database [9].
- **Spoofed Images:** Six attack images were generated for each subject.

#### Results
| Service | TP/Baseline Conf. (%) | Spoofed/Overall Confidence (%) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| MS Cognitive | 100/78 | 100/65, 100/70, 100/75, 100/70, 100/82, 100/84, 100/86 |
| Amazon | 100/97 | 100/82, 100/89, 80/77, 90/67, 70/84, 60/84, 90/89 |
| Face++ | 100/87 | 100/83, 100/86, 100/71, 100/72, 90/77, 70/80, 70/75 |
| Kairos | 100/80 | 80/58, 100/75, 100/78, 100/73, 100/91, 100/83, 100/80 |

## 4. Proposed System
### 4.1 Design
rtCaptcha is designed to integrate real-time CAPTCHA challenges into the face authentication process. The system generates dynamic CAPTCHA challenges that require the user to perform specific actions, such as blinking, smiling, or moving their head, to prove liveness.

### 4.2 Implementation
The system uses a combination of motion consistency, texture, and reflection analysis to detect liveness. Additionally, it leverages extra hardware, such as IR and depth cameras, to enhance the robustness of the liveness detection.

## 5. User Study
We conducted a user study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of rtCaptcha. The study involved a diverse group of participants and assessed the system's performance under various conditions.

## 6. Security of the Proposed System
The security of rtCaptcha was rigorously tested against a range of attacks, including still image, video replay, 3D mask, and deep learning-based attacks. The results showed that rtCaptcha significantly improved the security of face authentication systems.

## 7. Conclusion
rtCaptcha is a robust and effective liveness detection system that enhances the security of face authentication. By integrating real-time CAPTCHA challenges, rtCaptcha provides a practical and scalable solution to the problem of liveness detection. Future work will focus on further improving the system's usability and expanding its application to other biometric modalities.
