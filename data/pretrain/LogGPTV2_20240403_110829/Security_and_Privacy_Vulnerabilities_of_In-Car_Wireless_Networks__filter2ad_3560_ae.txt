ations to (cid:2)lter out suspicious transmissions.
6.2 Improving Data Packet Format
One fundamental reason that eavesdropping and spoof-
ing attacks are feasible in TPMS systems is that packets
are transmitted in plaintext. To prevent these attacks, a
(cid:2)rst line of defense is to encrypt TPM packets3. The ba-
sic packet format in a TPMS system included a sensor ID
(cid:2)eld, (cid:2)elds for temperature and tire pressure, (cid:2)elds for
various warning (cid:3)ags, and a checksum. Unfortunately,
the current packet format used is ill-suited for proper en-
cryption, since naively encrypting the current packet for-
mat would still support dictionary-based cryptanalysis as
well as replay attacks against the system. For this reason,
we recommend that an additional sequence number (cid:2)eld
be added to the packet to ensure freshness of a packet.
Further, requiring that the sequence number (cid:2)eld be in-
cremented during each transmission would ensure that
subsequent encrypted packets from the same source be-
come indistinguishable, thereby making eavesdropping
and cryptanalysis signi(cid:2)cantly harder. We also recom-
mend that an additional cryptographic checksum (e.g. a
message authentication code) be placed prior to the CRC
checksum to prevent message forgery.
Such a change in the payload would require that
TPMS sensors have a small amount memory in order to
store cryptographic keys, as well as the ability to perform
encryption. An obvious concern is the selection of cryp-
tographic algorithms that are suf(cid:2)ciently light-weight to
be implemented on the simple processor within a TPMS
sensor, yet also resistant to cryptanalysis. A secondary
concern is the installation of cryptographic keys. We en-
vision that the sensors within a tire would be have keys
pre-installed, and that the corresponding keys could be
entered into the ECU at the factory, dealership, or a cer-
ti(cid:2)ed garage. Although it is unlikely that encryption and
authentication keys would need to be changed, it would
be a simple matter to piggy-back a rekeying command
on the 125kHz activation signal in a manner that only
certi(cid:2)ed entities could update keys.
6.3 Preventing Spoofed Activation
The spoo(cid:2)ng of an activation signal forces sensors to
emit packets and facilitates tracking and battery drain at-
tacks. Although activation signals are very simple, they
can convey a minimal amount of bits. Thus, using a long
packet format with encryption and authentication is un-
suitable, and instead we suggest that the few bits they can
convey be used as a sequencing (cid:2)eld, where the sequenc-
ing follows a one-way function chain in a manner anal-
ogous to one-time signatures. Thus, the ECU would be
responsible for maintaining the one-way function chain,
and the TPMS sensor would simply hash the observed
sequence number and compare with the previous se-
quence number. This would provide a simple means of
(cid:2)ltering out false activation signals. We note that other
3We note that encrypting the entire message (or at least all (cid:2)elds
that are not constant across different cars) is essential as otherwise the
ability to read these (cid:2)elds would support a privacy breach.
14
legitimate sources of activation signals are specialized
entities, such as dealers and garages, and such entities
could access an ECU to acquire the position within the
hash chain in order to reset their activation units appro-
priately to allow them to send valid activation signals.
7 Related Work
Wireless devices have become an inseparable part of our
social fabric. As such, much effort has been dedicated
to analyze the their privacy and security issues. Devices
being studied include RFID systems [27, 30, 41], mass-
market UbiComp devices [38], household robots [14],
and implantable medical devices [21]. Although our
work falls in the same category and complements those
works, TPMS in automobiles exhibits distinctive features
with regard to the radio propagation environment (strong
re(cid:3)ection within and off metal car bodies), ease of access
by adversaries (cars are left unattended in public), span
of usage, a tight linkage to the owners, etc. All these
characteristics have motivated this in-depth study on the
security and privacy of TPMS.
One related area of research is location privacy in
wireless networks, which has attracted much attention
since wireless devices are known to present tracking
risks through explicit identi(cid:2)ers in protocols or identi-
(cid:2)able patterns in waveforms.
In the area of WLAN,
Brik et al. have shown the possibility to identify users
by monitoring radiometric signatures [10]. Gruteser et
al. [19] demonstrated that one can identify a user’s loca-
tion through link- and application-layer information. A
common countermeasure against breaching location pri-
vacy is to frequently dispose user identity. For instance,
Jiang et al. [24] proposed a pseudonym scheme where
users change MAC addresses each session. Similarly,
Greenstein et al. [18] have suggested an identi(cid:2)er-free
mechanism to protect user identities, whereby users can
change addresses for each packet.
In cellular systems, Lee et al. have shown that the lo-
cation information of roaming users can be released to
third parties [28], and proposed using the temporary mo-
bile subscriber identi(cid:2)er to cope with the location privacy
concern. IPv6 also has privacy concerns caused by the
(cid:2)xed portion of the address [32], and thus the use of peri-
odically varying pseudo-random addresses has been rec-
ommended. The use of pseudonyms is not suf(cid:2)cient to
prevent automobile tracking since the sensors report tire
pressure and temperature readings, which can be used
to build a signature of the car. Furthermore, pseudonyms
cannot defend against packet spoo(cid:2)ng attacks such as we
have examined in this paper.
Security and privacy in wireless sensor networks have
been studied extensively. Perrig et al. [37] have proposed
a suite of security protocols to provide data con(cid:2)dential-
ity and authentication for resource-constrained sensors.
Random key predistribution schemes [12] have been pro-
posed to establish pairwise keys between sensors on de-
mand. Those key management schemes cannot work
well with TPMS, since sensor networks are concerned
with establishing keys among a large number of sensors
while the TPMS focuses on establishing keys between
four sensors and the ECU only.
Lastly, we note related work on the security of a car’s
computer system [26]. Their work involved analyzing
the computer security within a car by directly mounting
a malicious component into a car’s internal network via
the On Broad Diagnostics (OBD) port (typically under
the dash board), and differs from our work in that we
were able to remotely affect an automobile’s security at
distances of 40 meters without entering the car at all.
new tires. The recommendations include standard reli-
able software design practices and basic cryptographic
recommendations. We believe that our analysis and rec-
ommendations on TPMS can provide guidance towards
designing more secure in-car wireless networks.

Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) are the (cid:2)rst
in-car wireless network to be integrated into all new cars
in the US and will soon be deployed in the EU. This pa-
per has evaluated the privacy and security implications
of TPMS by experimentally evaluating two representa-
tive tire pressure monitoring systems. Our study revealed
several security and privacy concerns. First, we reverse
engineered the protocols using the GNU Radio in con-
junction with the Universal Software Radio Peripheral
(USRP) and found that: (i) the TPMS does not employ
any cryptographic mechanisms and (ii) transmits a (cid:2)xed
sensor ID in each packet, which raises the possibility of
tracking vehicles through these identi(cid:2)ers. Sensor trans-
missions can be triggered from roadside stations through
an activation signal. We further found that neither the
heavy shielding from the metallic car body nor the low-
power transmission has reduced the range of eavesdrop-
ping suf(cid:2)ciently to reduce eavesdropping concerns. In
fact, TPMS packets can be intercepted up to 40 meters
from a passing car using the GNU Radio platform with a
low-cost, low-noise ampli(cid:2)er. We note that the eaves-
dropping range could be further increased with direc-
tional antennas, for example.
We also found out that current implementations do
not appear to follow basic security practices. Messages
are not authenticated and the vehicle ECU also does not
appear to use input validation. We were able to inject
spoofed messages and illuminate the low tire pressure
warning lights on a car traveling at highway speeds from
another nearby car, and managed to disable the TPMS
ECU by leveraging packet spoo(cid:2)ng to repeatedly turn on
and off warning lights.
Finally, we have recommended security mechanisms
that can alleviate the security and privacy concerns pre-
sented without unduly complicating the installation of
