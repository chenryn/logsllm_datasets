### 6.2 Improving Data Packet Format

One fundamental reason that eavesdropping and spoofing attacks are feasible in TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems) is that data packets are transmitted in plaintext. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, a primary defense strategy is to encrypt the TPM (Tire Pressure Monitoring) packets. The basic packet format in a TPMS system includes fields for sensor ID, temperature, tire pressure, various warning flags, and a checksum. Unfortunately, the current packet format is not suitable for effective encryption, as naively encrypting it would still be susceptible to dictionary-based cryptanalysis and replay attacks.

To address this, we recommend adding a sequence number field to the packet to ensure its freshness. Additionally, requiring the sequence number to be incremented with each transmission ensures that subsequent encrypted packets from the same source become indistinguishable, making eavesdropping and cryptanalysis significantly more challenging. We also suggest incorporating a cryptographic checksum, such as a message authentication code (MAC), before the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) checksum to prevent message forgery.

Implementing these changes would require TPMS sensors to have a small amount of memory to store cryptographic keys and the capability to perform encryption. It is crucial to select cryptographic algorithms that are lightweight enough to be implemented on the simple processors within TPMS sensors while being resistant to cryptanalysis. Another concern is the installation of cryptographic keys. We propose that the sensors within a tire should have pre-installed keys, and the corresponding keys could be entered into the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) at the factory, dealership, or a certified garage. Although it is unlikely that encryption and authentication keys will need to be changed frequently, it would be straightforward to include a rekeying command piggybacked on the 125kHz activation signal, accessible only to certified entities.

### 6.3 Preventing Spoofed Activation

Spoofing an activation signal can force TPMS sensors to emit packets, facilitating tracking and battery drain attacks. Although activation signals are simple, they can convey a minimal amount of bits. Using a long packet format with encryption and authentication is unsuitable in this context. Instead, we suggest using the few bits available as a sequencing field, where the sequencing follows a one-way function chain, similar to one-time signatures. The ECU would be responsible for maintaining the one-way function chain, and the TPMS sensor would hash the observed sequence number and compare it with the previous sequence number. This approach provides a simple means of filtering out false activation signals.

Other legitimate sources of activation signals, such as dealers and garages, could access the ECU to acquire the position within the hash chain, allowing them to reset their activation units appropriately to send valid activation signals.

### 7 Related Work

Wireless devices have become an integral part of our social fabric, and significant efforts have been dedicated to analyzing their privacy and security issues. Devices under study include RFID systems [27, 30, 41], mass-market UbiComp devices [38], household robots [14], and implantable medical devices [21]. While our work complements these studies, TPMS in automobiles presents unique challenges due to the radio propagation environment (strong reflection within and off metal car bodies), ease of access by adversaries (cars are often left unattended in public), and the tight linkage to the owners. These characteristics have motivated an in-depth study of the security and privacy of TPMS.

One related area of research is location privacy in wireless networks, which has gained attention due to the tracking risks posed by explicit identifiers in protocols or identifiable patterns in waveforms. In WLANs, Brik et al. [10] demonstrated the possibility of identifying users by monitoring radiometric signatures. Gruteser et al. [19] showed that user locations can be identified through link- and application-layer information. A common countermeasure against breaching location privacy is to frequently change user identities. For example, Jiang et al. [24] proposed a pseudonym scheme where users change MAC addresses each session. Similarly, Greenstein et al. [18] suggested an identifier-free mechanism to protect user identities, allowing users to change addresses for each packet.

In cellular systems, Lee et al. [28] showed that the location information of roaming users can be released to third parties and proposed using temporary mobile subscriber identifiers to address location privacy concerns. IPv6 also has privacy concerns due to the fixed portion of the address [32], and the use of periodically varying pseudo-random addresses has been recommended. However, the use of pseudonyms is insufficient to prevent automobile tracking, as TPMS sensors report tire pressure and temperature readings, which can be used to build a signature of the car. Furthermore, pseudonyms cannot defend against packet spoofing attacks, as examined in this paper.

Security and privacy in wireless sensor networks have been extensively studied. Perrig et al. [37] proposed a suite of security protocols to provide data confidentiality and authentication for resource-constrained sensors. Random key predistribution schemes [12] have been proposed to establish pairwise keys between sensors on demand. However, these key management schemes are not well-suited for TPMS, as sensor networks focus on establishing keys among a large number of sensors, whereas TPMS focuses on establishing keys between four sensors and the ECU.

Lastly, related work on the security of a car's computer system [26] involved analyzing the computer security within a car by directly mounting a malicious component into the car's internal network via the OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) port. Our work differs in that we were able to remotely affect an automobile's security at distances of up to 40 meters without entering the car.

### 8 Concluding Remarks

Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) are the first in-car wireless network to be integrated into all new cars in the US and will soon be deployed in the EU. This paper evaluates the privacy and security implications of TPMS by experimentally assessing two representative systems. Our study revealed several security and privacy concerns. First, we reverse-engineered the protocols using GNU Radio in conjunction with the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and found that: (i) TPMS does not employ any cryptographic mechanisms and (ii) transmits a fixed sensor ID in each packet, raising the possibility of vehicle tracking. Sensor transmissions can be triggered from roadside stations through an activation signal. We also found that neither the heavy shielding from the metallic car body nor the low-power transmission sufficiently reduces the range of eavesdropping. TPMS packets can be intercepted up to 40 meters from a passing car using the GNU Radio platform with a low-cost, low-noise amplifier. The eavesdropping range could be further increased with directional antennas.

We also discovered that current implementations do not follow basic security practices. Messages are not authenticated, and the vehicle ECU does not appear to use input validation. We were able to inject spoofed messages and illuminate the low tire pressure warning lights on a car traveling at highway speeds from another nearby car, and managed to disable the TPMS ECU by repeatedly turning on and off warning lights through packet spoofing.

Finally, we have recommended security mechanisms that can alleviate the security and privacy concerns presented without unduly complicating the installation of new tires. These recommendations include standard reliable software design practices and basic cryptographic measures. We believe that our analysis and recommendations on TPMS can provide guidance towards designing more secure in-car wireless networks.
