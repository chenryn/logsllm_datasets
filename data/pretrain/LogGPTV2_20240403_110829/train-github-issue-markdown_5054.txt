When a folder has a lot of files, more than fits on the screen vertically, I
would like to 'focus' a specific file by typing the first letters of the file.  
I notice 'A' and 'D' are already mapped by default to _add_ and _duplicate_ ,
so I propse to add 'F' (or 'S') for _find_ (or _search_ ) to use following
keyboard input for finding a matching file and focusing it, bringing it into
view if it's off screen.  
A comparative user experience is in Windows Explorer, also when done there on
the folder tree-view, if I remember correctly, the search is done over all
currently visible nodes of the tree.
