 **Description:**
When Deno is called from a directory that used to exist but doesn't anymore
(i.e. deleted externally), it will panic.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. `mkdir /tmp/testing && cd /tmp/testing`
  2. `deno` or `deno repl` or `deno run https://deno.land/std/examples/welcome.ts`
  3. Observe that it works
- _in another terminal_ -
`rm -rf /tmp/testing`
- _back to the original terminal_ -
  4. Re-run the command.
  5. Observe panic.
