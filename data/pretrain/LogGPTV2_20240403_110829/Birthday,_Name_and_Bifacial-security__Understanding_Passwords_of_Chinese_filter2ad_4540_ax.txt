improvement increases. For example, at 105 guesses,
there is 0.09%∼0.85% improvement in success rate; at
106 guesses, this ﬁgure is 1.32∼4.32%; at 107 guesses,
this ﬁgure reaches 1.70%∼4.29%. This indicates that
the vulnerable behaviors of using monotonically long
passwords, Pinyin names and birthdays help an attacker
reduce her search space, and this issue is more serious
when large guesses are allowed.
Comparison. Li et al. [34] reported that using 2M
Dodonew passwords as the training set and at 1010 guess-
es, their best success rates (= # of successfully cracked PWs
)
is about 17.30%. However, against the same Chinese
test sets, our improved attack can achieve much higher
success rates (29.41%∼39.47%) at only 107 guesses.

(a) Coverage of L-segments (b) Impact of Pinyin-name-segments on security
Figure 5: Coverage and security impacts of Pinyin-
name-segments in the test set Tianya with L-segments
involved (Duowan is the training set, Pinyin name is an
extra input dictionary in our improved PCFG attack).
This means that we can crack 70% to 128% more pass-
words than Li et al.’s best record. Our attacks are better
because: 1) Our training-set (i.e., Duowan) is more ef-
fective than [34], for we ﬁnd Duowan represents Chinese
password distributions better (see Table 2) than Dodonew
as used in [34]; 2) We optimize PCFG not only through
adding semantic dictionaries as [34] but also through
transforming monotonically long base structures.
The role of Names.
In our improved PCFG-based
attacks, external name segments are added into the PCFG
L-segment dictionary during training, and we get glad-
some increases in success rates (see Fig. 4(c)). However,
such improvements are still not so prominent as com-
pared to the prevalence of names in Chinese passwords.
To explicate this paradox, we scrutinize the internal
