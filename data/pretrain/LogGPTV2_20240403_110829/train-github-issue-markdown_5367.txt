When hardware acceleration is enabled (OS X 10.10.1, Atom 0.165.0), rendering
artifacts occur when text clips behind the vertical scrollbar in the file
pane. I've included a GIF animation that demonstrates the problem. I've
noticed it doesn't always occur. For example, if I have the setting page open
and active, I don't get the artifacts when sliding the file pane.

Disabling hardware acceleration fixes the issue. I wonder whether this was
something introduced as a result of fixing issue #3559.
