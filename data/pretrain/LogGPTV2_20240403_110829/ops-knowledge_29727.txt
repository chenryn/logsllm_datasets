User: I am new to python scripting and started to look into a script to allow me to SSH to a box and check it is still running.
I have installed ActiveState (Python 2.7) on my windows desktop. 
Using PyPM I have installed paramiko and pycrypto 
but when I try to execute my scripts I get the following error:
Script: python C:\Python27\Scripts\RunOnEnv\ssh-matic.py
Error:ImportError:no Modules named ssh
When passing:
'>>>help('modules') 
I can not see ssh in the list.
I have tried uninstalling and installing the modules with no problems.
What else am I missing?
Assistant: I feel really foolish.
After reading that paramiko has replaced ssh module there still is an ssh module available.
Ooops!!
