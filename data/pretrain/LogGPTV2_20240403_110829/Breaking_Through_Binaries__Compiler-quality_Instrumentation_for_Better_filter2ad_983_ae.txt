7.5 Scalability and Precision
We recognize the fuzzing community’s overwhelming desire
for new tools that support many types of software—with a
growing emphasis on more complex, real-world targets. But
for a static rewriter to meet the needs of the fuzzing com-
munity, it must also achieve high precision with respect to
compiler-generated code. This section examines ZAFL’s scal-
ability to binaries beyond our evaluation benchmarks, as well
as key considerations related to its static rewriting precision.
7.5.1 Scalability
We instrument and test ZAFL on a multitude of popular real-
world binaries of varying size, complexity, source availability,
and platform. We focus on Linux and Windows as these plat-
forms’ binary formats are common high-value targets for
fuzzing. All binaries are instrumented with ZAFL’s AFL-like
conﬁguration; we do the same for Windows binaries using
ZAFL’s cross-instrumentation support. We test instrumented
binaries either with our automated regression test suite (used
throughout ZAFL’s development); or by manually running
the application (for Windows) or testing the instrumentation
output with afl-showmap [93] (for Linux).
We verify ZAFL achieves success on 33 open-source Linux
and Windows binaries, shown in Table 8. To conﬁrm ZAFL’s
applicability to true binary-only use cases, we expand our
testing with 23 closed-source binaries from 19 proprietary and
commercial applications, listed in Table 9. In summary, our
ﬁndings show that ZAFL can instrument Linux and Windows
binaries of varying size (e.g., 100K–100M bytes), complexity
(100–1M basic blocks), and characteristics (open- and closed-
source, PIC and PDC, and stripped binaries).
7.5.2 Liveness-aware Optimization
As discussed in § 4.2, register liveness analysis enables opti-
mized instrumentation insertion for closer-to-compiler-level
