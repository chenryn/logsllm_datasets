RIRs do not conform to a standard syntax, making it chal-
lenging to automatically extract certain information from them.
For example, the APNIC registry does not have an organization
object, while the LACNIC registry has an owner object slightly
different from the organization object found in other RIRs.
On the other hand, the ARIN registry has a customer object
in addition to organization objects but it contains only name
and address, missing additional crucial contact information. To
collect information from Whois, we manually map the most
relevant objects and attributes to our system to the objects in
Figure 4.
Sub-allocations. RIRs allocate blocks of IP addresses to Local
Internet Registries (LIR) within their region, e.g. ISPs. LIRs
have the option to further split their allocated blocks and assign
them to their customers. Figure 5 illustrates the cycle of a
network block registration in which a direct allocation is made

block may go through further sub-allocations to customers.
Also, a service provider’s resellers are assigned sub-allocations
and are recorded into Whois at the discretion of the service
provider.
• Sub-allocation example: Using our purchased reseller pack-
ages described earlier, we found that our network blocks were
registered into Whois as sub-allocations. Table I illustrates
a partial view of the inetnum object registered in ARIN
Whois directory of our sub-allocation through “ColoCrossing”.
Incidentally, our other sub-allocation with “Voxility” did not
use the same organization object but rather created a new one
with the same attribute values.
Freshness of Whois records. Based on our observation,
Whois records in all 5 RIRs are frequently updated. New
objects of type inetnum, persons and organizations are created
daily and even the objects currently stored in Whois are often
updated. On a monthly basis, we witnessed an average of a
10% change rate of objects in each RIR. Table II illustrates
RIR speciﬁc metrics evaluating the percentage of objects added
and updated on a monthly basis.

allocations and 43% of these sub-allocations are owned and
managed by a client of the legitimate service provider.
To investigate this abuse of legitimate services, we analyzed
two data sets. Firstly, looking at the set of 30K blacklisted
IP addresses (explained earlier) and using the AS reputation
lists collected from the BGP ranking [6], we found that only
50 IP addresses (0.17%) belong to BP ASes while the rest
were from legitimate service providers. Secondly, using a set
of 95 blacklisted IP-preﬁxes collected through SpamHaus [14]
and mapping them to their corresponding 164 Whois network
blocks, we discovered that all 164 network blocks belong to
legitimate service providers and 73.7% of them are owned and
managed by clients of the service providers. This observation
makes us believe that indeed the abuse of legitimate service
providers, especially through sub-allocations managed by third
parties (i.e. clients), is pervasive.
III. FINDING BPH SUB-ALLOCATIONS
A. Overview
In this section, we elaborate on the design and implementa-
tion of a new technique for detecting malicious sub-allocations
under legitimate provider networks.
In our research, we capitalize on the use of sub-allocations
in Whois records by building a classiﬁer tuned to ﬁnding
malicious network blocks within larger blocks of legitimate
provider networks and ultimately ﬁnding BPH resellers. This
endeavor is by no means trivial: BP ASes were detected in
the prior research by using the malicious activities observed
throughout the entire AS, whereas a sub-allocation typically
only has a small chunk of IP addresses and is unlikely to
generate the same magnitude of bad signals for detecting a
malicious sub-allocation. In our research, we leverage a unique
observation that the BPH service, even on a legitimate provider
network, needs to intensively utilize DNS to support its mis-
sions, which allows us to build our detection technique on top
of a massive amount of DNS data that characterizes the BPH’s
activities. For this purpose, we collect numerous data feeds that
illuminate different aspects of the sub-allocations in question.
More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst run daily Whois scans of the IPv4
address space and then harvest the DNS records corresponding
to the collected Whois sub-allocations from Passive DNS [15].
Additionally, we collect a variety of reputation based lists
for ASes, IP addresses, domains and IP preﬁxes for feature
extraction and to support the training of our detection model.
This effort also requires a ground truth set of legitimate and
malicious network blocks. This is hard to acquire, since few of
these lists exist and those that do are often noisy or severely
limited in coverage. In order to overcome this obstacle, we
explore a few options for collecting a representative labeled
set, one of which is directly purchasing hosting packages from
BPH services.
Once data is collected,
it goes through our processing
pipeline which entails building network block hierarchies to
ﬁnd sub-allocations and their owners. After that, signiﬁcant
features are extracted to train a classiﬁer. The trained model is
then used to scan the larger set of sub-allocations and detect the
ones exhibiting similar malicious signals. Finally, we perform
an in-depth analysis of the BPH ecosystem. Figure 6 depicts
our processing work-ﬂow.

C. Abuse of Sub-allocations
Blacklisting. Current defenses against malicious network
blocks fall into one of two categories: ASes reputation sys-
tems and IP address blacklists. Coarse-grained AS reputation
systems, such as ASwatch [7], Fire[13] and BGP Ranking[6],
focus on reputation metrics that can rank and detect dedicated
malicious ASes (aka., BP). These AS reputation metrics are
based on aggregated meta data for all IP addresses within the
same AS. IP blacklists are more ﬁne-grained, by targeting each
IP address found to conduct malicious activities. As we will
show below, sub-allocations in legitimate service providers are
increasingly tied to malicious activities. Unfortunately, current
defenses are inadequate in ﬁnding and blocking such malicious
sub-allocations. To the best of our knowledge, SpamHaus’s
Edrop list [14] is the only blacklist that includes network
blocks. However, based on our conversations with SpamHaus
it is manually created and its coverage is quite limited: in the
period of 9 months during our study, only 101 IP-preﬁxes were
blacklisted.
Prevalence of sub-allocation abuse. We know based on anec-
dotal reports that sub-allocations are abused by BPH services
in order to build a virtual hosting service running under
the umbrella of legitimate service providers [2]. The scope
and magnitude of this problem, however, have never been
studied before. As a ﬁrst step towards better understanding
of this problem, we conducted an experiment with the goal
of answering the following questions: are sub-allocations in
legitimate service providers indeed abused, and if so, is such
a threat pervasive?
Speciﬁcally, we examined the prevalence of sub-allocations
in malicious activities by analyzing a 3-day snapshot (July 10-
12, 2016) of 30K blacklisted IP addresses collected through
our blacklist feed (BL-A, explained later in Section III-B).
Looking at their corresponding network blocks reﬂected in
Whois on July 12th, 2016, we found that only 19.7% of the
blacklisted IP addresses are directly allocated (i.e. managed
by the service provider) while the remaining 80.3% are sub-

[21]. This is accomplished by registering with each RIR and
requesting bulk access to Whois. Once approved, access is
granted to an FTP server to download the most recent copy
of the Whois database. In order to collect historical records of
the Whois database, we download a copy of the database once
a day starting from late Dec 2015, and utilize 25 snapshots
(10 days apart) in our study.
Unfortunately, depending on the RIR, the bulk snapshots
of the Whois are sometimes anonymized by dropping contact
information such as email and name. ARIN and APNIC are
the only registries that provide the full Whois database in bulk.
The other 3 RIRs omit some of the attributes and/or objects.
For example, some RIRs do not include the primary keys
of organizations and persons (in RIPE) and inetnum owners
(in LACNIC). Additionally, AFRINIC does not include the
user-names from contact emails. To supplement the missing
information, we generate daily queries through an RDAP API
supported by the RIR [22], [23], [24] for each missing or
recently updated (according to the bulk database) object.
PDNS. To ﬁnd domains hosted on sub-allocations and their
corresponding IP addresses, we obtain access to a database of
DNS look-ups collected by the Security Information Exchange
(SIE) [25]. 4 The data set contains aggregated records of DNS
look-ups over a two year period, and each record contains the
number of look-ups and two time-stamps indicating the ﬁrst
and the last time the record has been observed to have the same
value (i.e. the Rdata ﬁeld in a DNS packet). We download the
PDNS records that are in our scope of interest by submitting
reverse queries on the sub-allocations IP preﬁxes through their
API [15]. In total, we submitted 82K queries and collected
1.8 TB of PDNS records for our study.
AS Reputations. To compute the reputation of ASes, we
leverage BGP Ranking [6], which is a public service operated
by CIRCL. This service computes the reputation score of an
AS based on data acquired from IP address based blacklists.
We use BGP ranking for two purposes: determining ASes’
reputations and bulletproof AS score. ASes’ reputations are
collected by downloading historical scores of each AS from
2015 to 2016 and computing the average to reﬂect the score of
a given AS. Additionally, BGP ranking lists the top 100 ASes
with the highest scores (indicating a poor reputation), which
we also download on a daily basis from Jan - Oct 2016. We
compute a BP AS score threshold in much the same way as
ASwatch [7] by calculating the average score of the top 100
ASes for each day. We refer to this as the BP AS threshold
where any AS with a score that is equal to or higher than the
score is considered a BP AS.
Blacklists. We collect three types of blacklists: CleanMX,
SpamHaus Edrop and BL-A. CleanMX virus watch [16] is
maintained by the security community and contains historical
malicious and suspicious URLs and IP addresses. We parse
CleanMX lists and extract IP addresses and domains along
with their listing time-stamp. The SpamHaus project [3] is a
nonproﬁt organization that tracks cyber threats such as spam
and malware. It maintains a variety of blacklists, some of
which are available to the public. We use two of these lists:
4SIE collects data from a global sensor array that observes DNS cache
miss messages and collects 200,000 observations per second and processes
over 2 TB of data per day.

ground truth respectively.

Threat model. Given the perceived level of abuse, in this study
we focus on building a classiﬁer that can detect malicious
sub-allocated network blocks. Our threat model assumes that
the service providers are honest actors who will correctly
update Whois records for network blocks that are delegated
to resellers. If a service provider does not correctly update
the Whois information we will not be able to detect BPH
resellers operating within their networks. However, our initial
exploration shows that many of the currently abused ser-
vice providers are correctly updating sub-allocation Whois.
If a service provider ceased correctly updating sub-allocation
Whois, this could indicate a degree of complicity with the
BPH services that might justify unilateral action against the
service provider. In addition, we assume that other legitimate
resellers will not enable BPH by renting them stable hosting
unless, again, they are complicit with the BPH reseller. We
also consider that the adversarial BPH services will attempt to
evade our detection. Thus, we will identify features that likely
increase their operational costs to evade detection.
B. Data Collection
As previously mentioned, our system relies on two key
data-sets: Whois that is used to ﬁnd sub-allocations, and Pas-
sive DNS (PDNS), which is used to extract signals indicative
of malicious behavior. Additionally, complementary data sets
are collected to help with validation and further analysis of the
data. Table III lists the meta data of the collected data sets, a
description of each data set follows.
Whois. Querying Whois over port 43 is not feasible due to
the amount of trafﬁc load it would generate when scanning
the entire IP address space especially on a daily basis. Our
solution is a two step process to collect daily Whois records
of the full IPv4 address space. First, we download the full
Whois database of each of the 5 RIRs [17], [18], [19], [20],
810

Edrop [14] and ROKSO[26]. The Edrop list is a manually
maintained list of IP address preﬁxes controlled by cyber
criminals which we download daily for nine months. We
explain the ROKSO list below.
Additionally, we utilize a commercial reputation system,
referred to throughout this paper as “BL-A”, which provides
real-time threat
intelligence on IP addresses and domains
involved in a variety of malicious behaviors such as malware,
command and control, DoS attacks, botnets, exploits and
vulnerabilities. BL-A also labels detected IP addresses and
domains with one of 40 labels indicating the type of activities
observed. Compared to CleanMX, this feed has a low false
positive rate and reasonable coverage while CleanMX has a
high rate of false positives, but improved domain coverage.
We collected this real time feed for 14 months.
C. Ground Truth
Unlike domain name based systems where there are numer-
ous ways to collect a labeled set, such as domain blacklists,
commercial products, and active scanning of domains, ﬁnding
labeled sets for network based detection systems is challeng-
ing. Previous research on BP ASes detection focuses on a
handful of labeled BP ASes: e.g. 15 labeled BP ASes used by
ASwatch [7]. Other AS reputation systems, such as FIRE [13],
do not utilize a labeled set, but rather evaluate their results
by comparing their top 10 ASes with other reputation based
systems. In addition to the challenging problem of ﬁnding
labeled malicious sub-allocations, ﬁnding labeled clean sub-
allocations is also problematic due to the noise introduced by
the temporary abuse of legitimate sub-allocations.
To address these challenges, we generate a labeled set
with varying degrees of noise and experiment using different
combinations in the training phase of the system, which is
explained later in Section IV-A. Table IV provides an overview
of the generated labeled sets.
Finding clean sub-allocations. Clean sub-allocations are
collected from two sources: Alexa [4] and top hosting
providers [5]. For the Alexa set, we collected the top 50K
domains (according to Alexa [4]) that have been continuously
present
in the list from 2013 to 2015 (collected through
the Archives [27]). For the selected list of domain names,
we perform real-time DNS look-ups to obtain their host-
ing IP addresses and subsequently their corresponding sub-
