### Communication and Customer Incentives

Effective communication can reduce costs and improve the incentives for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to address security issues. The rate at which customers seek help is closely related to the actions they take. As observed in Section V-A, the remediation rate of the email-only group was similar to that of the control group. However, the walled garden groups showed a higher likelihood of taking action, which was also associated with more frequent communication with the ISP.

|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Email**              | 16 (40.0%)            | 23 (57.5%)                           | 67 (69.1%)                          |

| **Helpdesk**           | 3 (7.5%)              | 21 (52.5%)                           | 44 (45.4%)                          |

### Analysis of Customer Messages

We analyzed a sample of approximately 20% of the messages in each category and created labels for recurring themes. We then read all messages and manually labeled each one to determine if a specific theme was present. Table VIII presents the results aggregated across all customers, indicating whether a theme was present in any of their messages. The general pattern confirms our findings from the phone interviews. 

#### Key Findings

- In the walled garden treatments, about one-third of customers reported running an antivirus scanner on their PC to address the issue. This highlights that a significant portion of the affected population does not fully understand the basic properties of IoT malware, even after reading the notification.
- There was a weak correlation between running an antivirus and slower remediation. Approximately 60% of these customers were clean after five days, compared to 60% of other customers who were clean within a little over one day. Both groups reached 90% remediation within two weeks.
- Despite working from an incorrect mental model, many users were able to remediate the issue. Of the 51 customers who mentioned running a virus scanner, 23 also mentioned disconnecting a device. Proportionally, this rate is higher than for those who did not mention running an antivirus. Overall, around 40% of the customers in the walled garden groups mentioned disconnecting a device, compared to just 7.5% in the email-only group.
- In the improved walled garden group, dissatisfaction or frustration was significantly lower than in the standard walled garden group. This may be due to the improved message being more helpful, or it could be because the improved notifications were issued several months later, when more people had seen media reports about IoT compromises and were more accepting of the need for countermeasures.

### Interpretation of Results

The customer experience data helps explain the high remediation rates in the walled garden groups. Although users may not fully grasp the technical details of the infection, they still take effective actions, such as disconnecting devices. This intuitive countermeasure, while costly in terms of device usability, is effective.

It is tempting to speculate that these customer responses might explain the low reinfection rates in the standard walled garden group. For example, users might keep devices disconnected for longer periods or reconnect them differently, reducing exposure to the public internet. Another possibility is that they factory reset their routers, closing open ports and disabling the DMZ and uPnP, leaving them in a less vulnerable state.

However, the low reinfection rates in the control group suggest that other factors, such as the non-persistent nature of Mirai, may also play a significant role. Future research will be needed to fully understand these dynamics.

### Related Work

#### Botnet Mitigation by ISPs

Several studies have examined the role of ISPs in botnet mitigation and remediation. One notable study empirically confirmed that ISPs are critical control points for botnet mitigation, with varying infection levels even among ISPs operating in the same country and market. Other work, such as the Conﬁcker cleanup initiative, found no clear impact of national initiatives to mitigate botnets. Industry groups and international organizations have published best practices for ISPs, including methods like postal mail, email, phone, and walled garden notifications. However, the effectiveness of these methods is not always well-documented.

#### Efficacy of Abuse and Vulnerability Notifications

Research has focused on the efficacy of email notifications for large-scale vulnerability and abuse notifications. Studies have shown that detailed notifications to operators and webmasters can increase remediation rates, but overall impact remains marginal. Email-based notifications often face deliverability issues, leading to the exploration of alternative mechanisms such as postal mail, social media, and phone calls. While these methods show slightly higher remediation rates, the additional costs and effort may not justify their use.

#### End User Security Behavior

A significant body of work has explored the challenges end users face in following security advice. Studies have found that many users do not correctly understand automatic update settings and often follow a usability/security trade-off. Effective communication between customers and ISPs is crucial for ensuring better understanding and higher remediation rates.

### Ethical Considerations

This study used passively collected datasets and a small number of active scans, following the guidelines of the Menlo Report. All data was anonymized, and only the partner ISP's employees knew the identities of the infected customers. We adhered to the ISP's policies and notified all infected subscribers. The experimental design included random assignment and observation of abuse feed and darknet data, which is not considered human subject research. Customers in the control group received notifications with a 14-day delay, and interviewees had the option to opt out.

### Limitations

1. **Detection and Tracking**: Detecting and tracking infections is challenging. No method captures all infected machines, and missing observations complicate cleanup inferences. We mitigated this by adopting a conservative approach, assuming no cleanup if the same customer reappeared within 21 days.
2. **External Validity**: The study's external validity is open to discussion. While conducted in a real-world setting with a large ISP, the results may not generalize to other ISPs without further experiments.
3. **Dynamic Nature of Malware**: Our findings are based on Mirai, a non-persistent malware. As IoT malware becomes more sophisticated and persistent, remediation rates may decrease.

### Conclusion

This study provides the first empirical evidence of the effectiveness of quarantining and notifying infected customers via a walled garden, achieving a 92% remediation rate within 14 days. Email-only notifications had no observable impact. We also observed high natural remediation rates and low reinfection rates, though the reasons for the latter remain unclear. While quarantining infected devices is effective, future work is needed to address the evolving nature of IoT malware.
