User: I'm trying to run console commands via subprocess.Popen, and whenever I run it I get the windows "File not found" error, even when running the echo command.
I am also using Popen inside a thread made with the thread module. Is that the problem?
Assistant: Instead ofD:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\terabytest\sourcesdk\bin\orangebox\bin\vbsp.exe, useD:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/terabytest/sourcesdk/bin/orangebox/bin/vbsp.exe
This eliminates any complications with backslashes inside quotes.
