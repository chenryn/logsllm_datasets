**Current behavior**  
Building angular on windows throws the following error:
> Error at
> D:/GitHub/angular/modules/@angular/benchpress/src/reporter/console_reporter.ts:10:21:
> Cannot find module '../facade/lang'.
There is a missing symlink to facade in benchpress/src. The developer guide
advises that running ./scripts/windows/create-symlinks.sh should create the
symlinks required, but the text file the script uses as input to decide where
to create them is missing an entry for benchpress/src.
**Expected behavior**  
Build should proceed without this error.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
Clone the angular repo to Windows. Run the create-symlinks.sh script, observe
there is no symlink to facade in @angular/benchpress/src/ . After following
the other instructions in the developer guide run build.sh and see the error
listed above.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
It is broken.
