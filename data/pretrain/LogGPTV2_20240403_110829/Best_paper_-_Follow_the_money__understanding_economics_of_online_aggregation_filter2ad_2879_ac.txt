### User Utility and Tracking Opt-Out

The primary goal of users in this cat-and-mouse game is to opt out of tracking. By blocking, users prevent aggregators from collecting their data, which in turn reduces the revenue generated by targeted advertisements. This section quantifies the financial impact of such actions.

#### 5.1 Quantifying Revenue Loss

The amount of information available to aggregators can vary based on the privacy protection measures employed, as captured in the model described in Section 2.

**Cost of Blocking:**
When users implement privacy-preserving measures, they may experience a reduction in functionality. However, modeling the exact utility decrease due to blocking is beyond the scope of this paper.

**User Intent (Ia(u)):**
User intent reflects the interests of the user, as discussed in Section 2. Privacy preservation techniques hinder aggregators from inferring user intent through tracking. In our model, this results in two potential values for Ia(u):

\[
Ia(u) = 
\begin{cases} 
IIa(u) & \text{if } u \text{ and } p \text{ do nothing} \\
1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Here, implicit intent (IIa(u)) is what aggregators can infer, while explicit intent (EI(u)) encompasses all the information the user possesses. When the user or publisher blocks tracking, there is no increase in CPM due to intent, so it is set to 1.

**Quantifying the Cost of Blocking:**
Figure 5 illustrates the current value derived from implicit intent, which would be lost if users block. The average value of IIa(u) is 4.2 in the HTTP traces, 3.8 in mHTTP, and 3.1 in the Univ traces, respectively. If all users were to block (i.e., Ia(u) = 1), the revenue would decrease by a factor of 4.2 in HTTP, 3.8 in mHTTP, and 3.2 in the Univ traces, respectively. A large-scale adoption of blocking, such as making the Do Not Track (DNT) header [2] the default, would pose a significant threat to advertising revenue. If DNT proposals are honored by aggregators, it could lead to a lower quality of service as publishers lose additional revenues. Additionally, blocking can reduce the functionality of websites for users (e.g., blocking JavaScript via NoScript [22]). Therefore, it is unlikely that most users will take the extreme step of blocking entirely. However, even if just 5% of the top users (as shown in Figure 4) block, the revenue drop would range between 35%-60%. Assuming incorrect targeting is worse than no targeting, the revenue loss due to blocking provides a lower bound on the revenue loss due to obfuscation.

### Information Vectors and Revenue

As previously mentioned, the number of sessions plays a central role in determining revenue. However, we find that some categories are more lucrative than others (e.g., 'Recreation' for mHTTP), which is reflected in the bid prices for different categories (Section 3.3). Additionally, bid prices also reflect the relative popularity of the categories. Publishers classified as 'Recreation' are the most visited in mHTTP, while the least visited belong to categories with the lowest bid prices. From a privacy perspective, if we consider k-anonymity, the most popular publishers (and most lucrative) would be the most private, while the least lucrative/popular would be less private.

**Top Publishers and Revenue:**
Table 3 shows the top publishers in the mHTTP dataset. Google (google.com) is the most visited publisher, with 18% of users visiting it. However, Facebook (facebook.com) generates the most revenue at 9%. Facebook's CDN, fbcdn.net, also contributes significantly to revenue by serving Facebook web pages. Revenue is correlated with the number of aggregators present on each publisher; in the mHTTP dataset, we find a correlation of 0.61 (r-value) between the number of aggregators and revenue per publisher.

**Top Aggregators:**
Table 2 lists the top aggregators in the mHTTP dataset. As in previous work [18], Google is a prominent aggregator, present on 80% of publishers in the mHTTP dataset. Figure 4 shows that advertising revenue is concentrated among a few aggregators, with the top 5-10% of aggregators receiving 90% of the ad revenue. Facebook is also a significant player, but domain publishers (e.g., google.co.uk and google.com) are considered separately, and possible user overlap prevents us from summing the fractions.
