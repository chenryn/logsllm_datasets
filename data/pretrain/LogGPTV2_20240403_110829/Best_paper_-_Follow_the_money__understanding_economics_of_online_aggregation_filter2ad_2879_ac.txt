the utility for the user. Whatever the outcome might be in
such a cat-and-mouse game, the intention from the users’ is
clear – to opt-out of tracking. Hence blocking prevents ag-
gregators from tracking users and reduces revenue generated
by targeted advertisements. We quantify this loss.
5.1 Quantifying revenue loss
The amount of information available to aggregators may
diﬀer based on privacy protection measures used and can be
captured in the model from Sec. 2.
The cost of blocking When users deploy privacy preserv-
ing measures they may experience decreased functionality.
Modeling the utility decrease due to blocking is beyond the
scope of this paper.
User Intent Ia(u).
Recall that user intent captures
the interests of the user (Sec. 2). Privacy preservation tech-
niques hinder aggregators from being able to infer the intent
of users through tracking. This gives two potential values
for Ia(u) in our model:
(cid:26) IIa(u) u and p do nothing
1
otherwise
Ia(u) =
(3)
Implicit intent (IIa(u)) is as described in Sec. 3.3. Recall
that implicit intent (IIa(u)) is what aggregators can infer,
while explicit intent (EI(u)) can consist of all the informa-
tion the user possesses. And when the user or publisher
block tracking there is no increase in CP M as a result of
intent, hence it is set to 1.
Quantifying the cost of blocking Fig. 5 shows how much
value is currently derived from implicit intent which stands
to be lost if users block. The average value of IIa(u) is 4.2

Which information vectors are most lucrative? As
mentioned earlier, number of sessions play a more central
role in determining revenue. However, we ﬁnd that some
categories are more lucrative than others (‘Recreation’ for
mHTTP), but this is reﬂected in the bid prices for diﬀer-
ent categories (Sec. 3.3).
In addition, the bid prices also
reﬂect the relative popularity of the categories (publishers
classiﬁed as ‘Recreation’ are the most visited in mHTTP).
Simultaneously, we ﬁnd that publishers that are least visited
belong to categories that have the lowest bid prices. From
a privacy perspective, if we consider k-anonymity, then the
most popular publishers (and most lucrative) would be the
most private while the least lucrative/popular would be less
private.
Most popular publishers do not necessarily gener-
ate most revenue. Table 3 shows the top publishers in the
mHTTP dataset. We ﬁnd that while Google (google.com) is
the most visited publisher with 18% of users visiting Google
as a publisher7, Facebook (facebook.com) actually gener-
ates the most revenue: 9%. We see Facebook’s CDN fbcdn.net
also generating signiﬁcant revenue since it also serves Face-
book Web pages. Revenue is correlated with the number
of aggregators present on each publisher, in the mHTTP
dataset, we ﬁnd a correlation of 0.61 (r-value) between num-
ber of aggregators and revenue per publisher.
Google is the top aggregator Table 2 shows the top ag-
gregators in the mHTTP dataset. As in previous work [18],
we observe Google playing an active role as an aggregator.
Google is present on signiﬁcantly more publishers than the
other aggregators, with presence on 80% of publishers in the
mHTTP dataset. Fig. 4 shows that advertising revenue is
concentrated by a few aggregators with the top 5-10% of
aggregators getting 90% of the ad revenue. Facebook also

in the HTTP, 3.8 in mHTTP and 3.1 in the Univ traces, re-
spectively. Indeed, when we compute revenue with all users
blocking (i.e., Ia(u) = 1) revenue decreases by a factor of
4.2 in the HTTP, 3.8 in mHTTP, and 3.2 in the Univ traces,
respectively. A large population of users blocking – in the
worst case, if the Do Not Track (DNT) header [2] became
default – would represent a signiﬁcant threat to advertis-
ing revenue. If proposals like DNT are honored by aggre-
gators this may lead to lowered quality of service as the
publisher will lose out on additional revenues. Blocking also
poses the potential to decrease functionality of Web sites for
users (e.g., blocking Javascript via NoScript [22]). Hence,
for these reasons, it can be argued that most users will not
take the extreme step of blocking entirely. However, we ﬁnd
that even if 5% of the top users (Fig. 4) block, the revenue
drop is between 35%-60%. Regarding obfuscation, assuming
that incorrect targeting is worse than no targeting, the drop
in revenues due to blocking will be a lower bound on revenue
loss due to obfuscation.
6. RELATED WORK
Much work has been done on understanding the eﬀective-
ness of behavioral targeting [6, 29], users’ attitudes towards
targeting [20], and designing systems for mining interests
of users for targeting [8]. The actual behavioral targeting
mechanisms are not known as they tend to be proprietary.
Likewise, recent work has focused on the problem of combat-
ing clickspam [10] and characterizing mobile advertising [28].
In addition, past work has also focused on understanding
the role online ads play in decision making [24, 27] or how
to properly set CPM values [7]. Our paper tries to shed light
on part of the advertising landscape using real data from an
economics perspective – understanding advertising revenue
as a function of user’s information.
7. CONCLUSIONS
Using HTTP traces, we looked into the relationship be-
tween how much information is collected by aggregators and
quantiﬁed how valuable this information can be. We devel-
oped a simple revenue model for targeted advertising to aid
us. Our results indicate that revenue is highly skewed to-
wards few aggregators, while it is not that skewed from a
user perspective. We also studied possible revenue drop if
users were to adopt unilateral privacy protection.
