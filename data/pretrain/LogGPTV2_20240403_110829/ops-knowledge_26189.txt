User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is the purpose of (ab)using the redirect page of my website for dubious URLs? My website has a redirect page with the format https://my.site/redirect?deeplink=https://foo.bar&amp;...

The redirect is implemented in Javascript, so when you request the site, you get a 200 and some HTML + JS, not a 30X.

I recently started to notice that someone is abusing the redirect page for dubious links (guns, viagra, ...). It was suspicious that the traffic of the page increased by a lot, especially at night, when there should be barely any traffic.

I started to log the requests including referer. The referers seem to be all kinds of different hosts (not the same one every time) but mostly redirect pages themselves. Examples are


http://foo1.bar/cgi/mt4/mt4i.cgi?cat=12&amp;mode=redirect&amp;ref_eid=3231&amp;url=http://my.site/redirect...
http://foo2.bar/modules/wordpress/wp-ktai.php?view=redir&amp;url=http://my.site/redirect...
http://www.foo3.bar/core.php?p=books&amp;l=en&amp;do=show&amp;tag=2774&amp;id=20536&amp;backlink=http://my.site/redirect...
http://www.google.sk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=172&amp;ved=0CCMQFjABOKoB&amp;url=http://my.site/redirect...


I'm actually in control of the URLs that users should be legitimately redirected to, so I implemented a whitelist of valid hosts and started redirecting invalid ones to my start page.

What I'm wondering is, why should someone abuse my redirect page in the described way? And are there any risks I should be aware of?

Assistant: Assuming that people trust your site, abusing redirections like this can help avoid spam filters or other automated filtering on forums/comment forms/etc. by appearing to link to pages on your site. Very few people will click on a link to https://evilphishingsite.example.com, but they might click on https://catphotos.example.com?redirect=https://evilphishingsite.example.com, especially if it was formatted as https://catphotos.example.com to hide the redirection from casual inspection - even if you look in the status bar while hovering over that, it starts with a reasonable looking string.

The main risks are to your site reputation (it's more likely to get black listed by filtering services if they spot dubious traffic being accessed through it) and to people following these links (who knows what is actually on the other site you're sending them to). It's unlikely to result in compromise of your server directly.
