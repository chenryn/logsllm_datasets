### Title: The Next-Gen PlugX/ShadowPad? An In-Depth Analysis of the Emerging China-Nexus Modular Trojan, Pangolin8RAT

Modular malware, such as PlugX and ShadowPad, have been the most widely used trojans in Chinese state-sponsored cyber operations. Since mid-2020, TeamT5 has identified a new modular trojan emerging in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, which has the potential to become their successor. We have named this trojan "Pangolin8RAT" due to the presence of "pangolin" in its PDB string and "p8rat" in its RTTI.

**Key Features of Pangolin8RAT:**
- **Modular Design:** Pangolin8RAT's functionalities can be expanded by downloading additional DLLs from its Command and Control (C2) server.
- **Communication Protocols:** Initially, it supported 8 communication protocols, including TCP, HTTPS, UDP, DNS, ICMP, HTTPSIPV6, WEB, and SSH. Recent versions have expanded beyond these 8 protocols, indicating ongoing development.
- **Development Similarities:** Based on code structure similarities, we believe Pangolin8RAT may have been developed by the same group responsible for Winnti and FFRAT.

**Potential Future Impact:**
Given its modular design, evolving code structure, and continuous development, we predict that Pangolin8RAT is likely to be shared or even sold among Chinese threat groups for both espionage and financially motivated operations. This could make it the next generation of PlugX/ShadowPad. However, as of now, Pangolin8RAT has not been widely shared and has only been associated with a specific Chinese APT group, which we track as "Tianwu."

**Tianwu's Activities:**
From 2020 to 2021, Tianwu has leveraged Pangolin8RAT to target various sectors in the APAC region, including:
- Online gaming and gambling
- Transportation
- Telecommunications
- Government

It is noteworthy that Tianwu shares overlapping Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) with the notorious APT41, and both groups have a preference for targeting the online gambling and gaming industry.

**Talk Overview:**
In this presentation, we will provide a detailed attack timeline of Pangolin8RAT and Tianwu from 2020 to 2021, along with our outlook on the group's future development.
