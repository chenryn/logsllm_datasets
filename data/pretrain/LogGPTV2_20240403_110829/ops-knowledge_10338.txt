Question: Why might a web application developer choose not to implement the 'Referrer-Policy: no-referrer, strict-origin-when-cross-origin' for their site?
"A": "It would prevent the Referer header from being sent to any origin, compromising the site's functionality.",
"B": "It would always send the full URL, including the path and query string, to any origin, compromising privacy.",
"C": "It would send no referrer information when navigating to a cross-origin, which can be too restrictive for analytics purposes.",
"D": "It would incorrectly configure the server to send referrer information to foreign origins only."
Answer: C
