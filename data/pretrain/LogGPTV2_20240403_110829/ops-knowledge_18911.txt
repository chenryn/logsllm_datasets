Question: As a security administrator, you are tasked with defining the security policy for your company's web server. Considering both security and functionality, which of the following statements are accurate regarding the choice of implementing a default-deny policy or a default-allow policy?
"A": "A default-allow policy may lead to security breaches if a service known to be vulnerable is accidentally not added to the deny list, potentially causing expensive security failures.",
"B": "A default-deny policy could result in loss of functionality or availability if a safe service is mistakenly omitted from the allow list, but is less likely to result in a security breach.",
"C": "A default-allow policy ensures that all services are inaccessible to external users unless they are explicitly listed in the allowed list, minimizing the chances of attacks.",
"D": "A default-deny policy might not detect security breaches quickly because it fails closed, and functional issues are less noticeable than open security gaps."
Answer: AB
