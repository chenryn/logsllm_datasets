I understand that you are currently using IDLE, which is a decent choice, but you are looking for better lightweight Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) specifically for Mac. There are several options available, both free and commercial, that you might find suitable. Here are a few recommendations:

1. **Vim**: A highly configurable text editor that can be extended to function as a full-featured IDE with the right plugins. It has a steep learning curve but is very powerful.

2. **Emacs**: Another highly extensible and powerful text editor that can be customized to serve as an IDE. Like Vim, it also has a significant learning curve.

3. **BBEdit**: A popular and robust text editor for macOS. It offers extensive features for code editing and is known for its performance and stability. BBEdit has a free version with limited features and a paid version with full functionality.

4. **Wing IDE**: A Python-specific IDE that is lightweight and feature-rich. It comes in both free and paid versions, with the paid version offering more advanced features like debugging and refactoring tools.

5. **Eclipse**: While Eclipse is a powerful and versatile IDE, it may not be considered lightweight due to its resource requirements. However, it is highly customizable and supports multiple programming languages, making it a good option if you need a more comprehensive development environment.

Each of these options has its own strengths, so the best choice depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you are looking for something truly lightweight, Vim, Emacs, or BBEdit might be more suitable. For a more feature-rich experience, Wing IDE or Eclipse could be better fits.
