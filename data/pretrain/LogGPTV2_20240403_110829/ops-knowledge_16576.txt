Assistant: This log chunk shows the connection and session activity of a software component. It begins with two accepted socket connections from two different IP addresses. Then, two sessions are expired due to exceeding the timeout of 10,000ms. A socket connection is closed for a client with a specific session ID. A new session is attempted to be established from a different IP address. A connection request is received from an old client and a new session is attempted to be established from a different IP address. Two more sessions are expired due to exceeding the timeout of 10,000ms. An end of stream exception is caught and a socket connection is closed for a client with a specific session ID. The autopurge interval is set to 0 and a connection request is received from a different IP address. Finally, a snapshot is taken and a follower is identified.
