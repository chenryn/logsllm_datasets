employees and their compliance with information security
policies, and asked (iii) if the company actively advanced
its information security, e. g., by investing in new informa-
tion security technologies. Figure 2 summarizes the ﬁndings.
The responses illustrate that most interviewees gave their com-
pany a positive assessment for information security sensitivity.
Based on the three questions, we built an information security
sensitivity score ranging from -6 to 64. According to the
regression model in Table 3, the sensitivity scores differed
between industry sectors. The regression model indicates
that interviewees working in communication, ﬁnances & in-
surance, real estate, professional, scientiﬁc, and technical
activities and administrative and support service activities
were signiﬁcantly more likely than the baseline construction
sector to report higher sensitivity scores. Interestingly, in-
terviewees working in larger companies were signiﬁcantly
more likely to report lower sensitivity scores than intervie-
wees working for smaller companies. Finally, the regression
model indicates that interviewees working in a tech job were
signiﬁcantly more likely to report lower information security
sensitivity scores.
Summary: Information Security Sensitivity. Interviewees
rated their organization’s security sensitivity as generally
high. While management made up a smaller portion of
the interviewee sample, they reported higher sensitivity
scores than regular employees. Finance and communication
4For this score, we mapped the three 4 point Likert items to {−2;−1;1;2}.
Based on the sum of these scales, an integer between [−6;6], we built a
“sensitivity score” that we used for a regression analysis.

industries received higher scores in general, while staff in
tech positions tended to report lower scores across all areas.
Perceived Risk. We asked the interviewees to assess the
risk for their company to become a victim of any cyberattack
within the next 12 months. We distinguished between targeted
attacks, i. e., attacks that would only threaten their company
speciﬁcally and mass attacks, i. e., attacks that would threaten
other companies as well (SQ: A.1.2).
We included the company demographics and sensitivity
from the previous section as optional factors in the regression
analysis. Surprisingly, the industry sector was dropped out as
a factor in both models, indicating that a company’s industry
sector was not correlated with risk awareness.
In general, interviewees reported signiﬁcantly lower risks
for a targeted attack (8.7%) than for a mass attack (34.9%).
Similar to the information security sensitivity score, the
interviewee’s job role correlated with their risk perception.
Our regression analysis indicates that employees working in
information technology or the management board positions
perceived a higher risk for mass attacks and data protection

count).
ofﬁcers and others were signiﬁcantly more likely to report a
lower risk for targeted attacks. Companies that reported ex-
port activity and international locations also reported higher
risk assessments for mass (Coef. 0.12 and 0.15) and targeted
attacks (Coef. 0.14 and 0.11). Furthermore, risk perception
varies with company size. Interviewees working for small
companies (< 50 employees) reported a lower perceived risk
than interviewees working for larger companies (≥ 500 em-
ployees) for targeted attacks (6.6% vs. 12.4%; 30.3% vs.
41.7%).
Interestingly, the impact of information security sensitivity
differs between mass and targeted attacks based on the sen-
sitivity type: in the regression model for mass attacks, risk
assessment negatively tracks with an increase of perceived
employee sensitivity (O.R. = −0.10), while in the model for
targeted attacks, negative effects are seen with perceived man-
ager sensitivity (O.R. = −0.04).
Summary: Perceived Risks. Most interviewees assess the
risk for their company of being hit by a targeted attack
as relatively low, compared to the risk of being hit by a
mass attack. In general, interviewees working for small
companies report a lower perceived risk of being attacked
than interviewees working for larger companies.
4.3 Deployed Security Measures
We asked interviewees to report deployed security measures
in their companies and distinguished between technical, e. g.,
ﬁrewall, and organizational measures, e. g., incident response
plans (SQ: A.3.1). Figure 4 provides an overview of the
reported security measures.
The majority of the interviewees reported that their compa-
nies deployed technical security measures. More than 90%
reported that they use ﬁrewalls, regularly patch and update

their systems, use up-to-date anti-virus software, deploy effec-
tive access control mechanisms, and secure backup strategies.
While we cannot provide an in-depth analysis of respective
technologies and deployment quality or maturity, our results
indicate that many common technical security measures ﬁnd
widespread adoption in companies.
In contrast, the adoption of organizational measures is
lower in general and more diverse. While most interviewees
reported written security and privacy policies (78.7%) in their
companies and that they get regularly reviewed and revised if
necessary (79.4%), only 29.9% report security certiﬁcations
or exercises or simulated the failures of computer systems in
their companies (37.4%). Again, we cannot provide more
in-depth details of the quality or maturity of policies or the
type of security certiﬁcation.
Figure 4 illustrates the deployment likelihood of both tech-
nical and organizational security measures varies with com-
pany size.
Technical Security Measures. While technical security
measures seem to ﬁnd widespread adoption in general, we
report individual measures in more detail below. We ran a
logistic regression for every technical security measure, in-
cluding demographics and risk awareness as optional factors.
We consider the following technical measures: regular
backups, up-to-date antivirus software, use of ﬁrewalls, reg-
ular security updates, use of individual access control, and
password requirements. Our regression models indicate that
for all technical measures other than access control, technical
staff was signiﬁcantly more likely to report the deployment of
the security measure than other employees. A potential expla-
nation is that technical staff is well-informed about deployed
measures.

ual access control and regular security updates. Tables 13–16

in the Appendix summarize the remaining regression models.
The reporting of deployed technical measures varied by inter-
viewee job role. Technical staff was more likely to report the
deployment of individual access control (O.R. = 1.6), regular
backups in a separate location (O.R. = 2.74), antivirus soft-
ware (O.R. = 3.33) and regular security updates (O.R. = 2.60).
Interviewees in management roles were signiﬁcantly less
likely to report the deployment of password requirements
(O.R. = 0.64), individual access control (O.R. = 0.39) and
ﬁrewalls (O.R. = 0.37).
We ﬁnd that the likelihood of deploying technical security
measures varies by industry sector: Compared to the con-
struction baseline, companies in the manufacturing (O.R. =
0.67), transportation (O.R. = 0.59), and ﬁnance and insurance
(O.R. = 3.80) sectors were more likely to deploy password
requirement policies. We found similar effects for the deploy-
ment of access control mechanisms. Considering the odds
ratio, companies in the communication (O.R. = 5.93), real
estate (O.R. = 6.56), and professional, scientiﬁc, and techni-
cal activities (O.R. = 5.86) sectors were most likely to deploy
access control. Companies in the transportation (O.R. = 0.51)
sector were also more likely to perform regular security up-
dates compared to the construction baseline. The deployment
of ﬁrewalls, antivirus software and the adoption of backup
strategies did not vary signiﬁcantly by industry sector.
The deployment of password requirement policies (O.R. =
1.23) and access control (O.R. = 1.25) varies by company
headcount. Larger companies were more likely to deploy

both security measures. In contrast, the use of antivirus soft-
ware, regular security updates, or ﬁrewalls do not track with
company headcount.
The use of antivirus software (O.R. = 4.18), ﬁrewalls
(O.R. = 3.77), and a company’s backup strategy (O.R. = 2.47)
varied with company age. Similarly, company age positively
correlated with the deployment of the previous measures -
more mature companies were more likely to deploy them.
However, we could not ﬁnd a correlation between company
age and other technical security measures.
We identiﬁed a correlation of the use of external informa-
tion security expertise with the deployment of access control
(O.R. = 1.99), antivirus software (O.R. = 2.87), regular secu-
rity updates (O.R. = 1.53) and ﬁrewalls (O.R. = 2.18).
Summary: Technical Security Measures. We ﬁnd that basic
technical security measures are widely deployed, even in
small companies. However, we also ﬁnd that aspects such
as industry sector, company headcount, company age and
the use of external information security expertise correlated
with a diverging deployment of technical security measures.
Organizational Security Measures. We report results for
the following deployed organizational security measures: in-
cident response plans, risk and vulnerability analyses, emer-
gency management and drills, information security certiﬁ-
cation, information security training for employees, written
information security policies and regular compliance checks.
Table 6 illustrates the regression analysis for security cer-
tiﬁcations. We list the remaining regression analyses for
organizational measures in tables 8–12 in the Appendix.
Similar to technical security measures, the regression anal-
yses suggest that the interviewees’ job role correlated with the
reporting of organizational security measures. Interviewees
working in tech were more likely to report all organizational
security measures, while interviewees working in manage-
ment more often reported the implementation of information
security policies, incident response plans (O.R. = 0.68), and
emergency drills (O.R. = 0.60). However, data protection
ofﬁcers were more likely to report on information security
policies (O.R. = 1.69) and their enforcement (O.R. = 1.56).
Figure 4 suggests that organizational measures are less
common than technical measures, especially in smaller com-
panies (cf. Table 6,8–12). Similarly, larger companies are
more likely to deploy written information security policies
