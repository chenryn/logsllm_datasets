in this section provide a lower bound of LOCK perfor-
mance against malicious hijackers.
6.4 Evaluation on Previous-Known At-
tacks
We reconstructed 7 previously known preﬁx hijacking
events. Table 4 shows the dates and ASes of the hijacker
and the target preﬁx (i.e., the victim) of these events. By
using all 73 monitors deployed on PlanetLab, LOCK is
able to accurately locate the hijacker ASes as the top-1
suspects for all these hijacking events, i.e., the true hi-
jackers are ranked ﬁrst on the suspect lists. Using the
monitor selection algorithm (clustering and ranking) pre-
sented in Section 4, we also identiﬁed the minimum set
of monitors that were required by LOCK to accurately
locate the hijacker in each of these previously-known
events. The last column of Table 4 shows that all hijack-
ers could be correctly located as top-1 suspects by using
16 or fewer monitors. A detailed investigation shows that
these hijacks polluted majority of the monitors, resulting
in LOCK’s high locating accuracy.
6.5 Evaluation on Controlled Real Attacks
In this set of experiments, we launched real imposture
attacks using four sites under our control. The schedule
is shown in Table 5. During the experiments each LOCK

monitor probed the target preﬁx 204.9.168.0/22 once ev-
ery 5 minutes. For the purpose of this experiment, we
used the detection scheme proposed in [45], which was
able to detect all the attacks launched from the controlled
sites. The hijackers in these experiments were “honest”,
i.e., no countermeasure was done by the hijackers. Thus
we observed that LOCK locates the hijackers as top-1
suspects in all the real imposture attacks.
In this real Internet experiment, we were able to eval-
uate the response time of LOCK in addition to its accu-
racy. The response time is deﬁned as the latency from
the time the the attack is launched by the hijacker to the
time that LOCK locates the hijacker. The response time
highly depends on two major factors: the speed of prop-
agation of invalid route advertisement and the probing
rate employed by LOCK monitors. It usually takes up to
a few minutes for a route advertisement to spread across
the Internet. This is the latency that an attack takes be-
fore making full impact on the Internet. After a LOCK
monitor is impacted by an attack, it may also take a few
minutes for the monitor to detect and locate the hijacker
because the monitor probes target preﬁxes periodically.
There are also few minor factors that may affect the re-
sponse time. For example, there can be a few seconds
latency for LOCK monitors to get replies for each probe.
However, they are neglected in our evaluation because
they are orders of magnitude smaller than the above two
major factors.
We record the timestamp each attack is launched from
a control site and the timestamp LOCK locates the hi-
jacker (i.e., that controlled site). Both of which are syn-
chronized with a common reference time server. The
response time is computed by taking the difference be-
tween the above two timestamps. If alternative detection
scheme is used, the observed response time serves as a
conservative upper bound of the latency that LOCK takes
to locate the hijacker.
Table 5 shows the response time and minimum number
of required monitors for locating these real preﬁx hijack-
ing events. We observe that LOCK is able to locate the
hijacker within 7 ∼ 13 minutes. Given that the probe fre-
quency of LOCK monitors is 5 minutes, the results im-
plies that it takes LOCK at most 2 ∼ 3 rounds of probes
to detect and locate the hijacker. Moreover, all hijack-
ers are correctly located as top-1 suspects by using 18 or
fewer monitors.
7 Related Work
A number of solutions have been proposed to proactively
defend against preﬁx hijacking. They can be categorized
into two broad categories: crypto based and non-crypto
based. Crypto based solutions, such as [4,8,13,19,27,35,
36], require BGP routers to sign and verify the origin AS
and/or the AS path to detect and reject false routing mes-
sages. However, such solutions often require signature
generation and veriﬁcation which have signiﬁcant impact
on router performance. Non-crypto based proposals such
as [11,18,32,37,44] require changing router softwares so
that inter-AS queries are supported [11, 32], stable paths
are more preferred [18, 37], or additional attributes are
added into BGP updates to facilitate detection [44]. All
the above proposals are not easily deployable because
they all require changes in router software, router con-
ﬁguration, or network operations, and some also require
public key infrastructures.
Recently, there has been increasing interest in solu-
tions for reactive detection of preﬁx hijacking [6, 12,
21, 22, 26, 34, 36, 45] because such solutions use passive
monitoring and thus are highly deployable. For exam-
ple, [43, 45] monitor the data plane, [21, 22, 26, 34] mon-
itor the control plane, and [6, 12, 36] monitor both con-
trol and data planes. LOCK is different from all these
approaches because LOCK locates the hijacker AS for
each preﬁx hijacking event, while the above approaches
only focus on detecting a hijacking event without further
revealing the location of the hijacker. In fact, LOCK can
be used together with any of the above hijacking detec-
tion algorithm for identifying hijacker AS because the
ﬂexibility of LOCK on using either control plane or data
plane information in locating hijacker.
Measurement-based solutions often require careful se-
lection of monitors. In particular, LOCK selects mon-
itors based on their likelihood of observing hijacking
events, while [45] proposed an initial monitor selection
algorithm to detect hijacks without further evaluation,
and [23] tries to understand the impact of hijackers in
different locations. In addition, there have been a num-
ber of studies [7,9,40] on the limitations of existing BGP
monitoring systems (e.g. RouteView) and the impacts of
monitor placement algorithms [29] for collecting BGP
data for a boarder range of applications such as topol-
ogy discovery, dynamic routing behavior discovery and
network black hole discovery [20, 41].
Finally, existing works [38, 39, 42] proposed to mit-
igating preﬁx hijacking by using an alternative routing
path [38, 39], or by modifying AS SET [42]. Though
LOCK does not directly handle the mitigation of preﬁx
hijacking events, LOCK can provide the hijacker loca-
tion information required by these mitigation schemes.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a robust scheme named LOCK
for locating the preﬁx hijacker ASes based on distributed
AS path measurements. LOCK has several advantages:
1) LOCK is an uniﬁed scheme that locates hijackers in
the same fashion across different types of preﬁx hijack-
ing attacks; 2) LOCK is a distributed scheme with work-
load distributed among multiple monitors; 3) LOCK is
a robust scheme because multiple monitors help improv-
ing locating accuracy and discounting individual errors;
and 4) LOCK is a ﬂexible scheme because it can use AS
path measurement data obtained either from data-plane
or from control-plane to locate the hijacker AS.
The performance of the LOCK scheme has been eval-
uated extensively through experiments in three kinds of
settings: test topology constructed based on real Inter-
net measurements, reconstructed known preﬁx hijack at-
tacks, and controlled preﬁx hijack attacks conducted on
the Internet. We have shown that the LOCK scheme is
very accurate, highly effective, and rapid reacting.

1Note that some vendor implementation does not check whether
the neighbor has appended its own AS in the announcement , while
some vendor implementation does check (in which this hijack does not
succeed).
2The complexity is not a concern here because the number of clus-
ters is relatively small comparing to traditional clustering problem.

4To choose the set of Tier-1 nodes, we started with a well known
list, and added a few high degree nodes that form a clique with the
existing set. Nodes other than Tier-1s but provide transit service to
other AS nodes, are classiﬁed as transit nodes, and the remainder of
nodes are classiﬁed as stub nodes.
