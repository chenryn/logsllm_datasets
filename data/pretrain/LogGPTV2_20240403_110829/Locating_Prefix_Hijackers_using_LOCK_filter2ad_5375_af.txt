#### 6.4 Evaluation on Previously Known Attacks
We reconstructed seven previously known prefix hijacking events. Table 4 provides the dates and Autonomous Systems (ASes) of both the hijackers and the target prefixes (i.e., the victims). Using all 73 monitors deployed on PlanetLab, LOCK accurately identified the hijacker ASes as the top-1 suspects for all these hijacking events. This means that the true hijackers were ranked first on the suspect lists. Additionally, we used the monitor selection algorithm (clustering and ranking) described in Section 4 to determine the minimum set of monitors required by LOCK to accurately locate the hijacker in each of these events. The last column of Table 4 shows that all hijackers could be correctly identified as top-1 suspects using 16 or fewer monitors. A detailed investigation revealed that these hijacks affected the majority of the monitors, leading to LOCK's high locating accuracy.

#### 6.5 Evaluation on Controlled Real Attacks
In this series of experiments, we conducted real imposture attacks using four sites under our control. The schedule is shown in Table 5. During the experiments, each LOCK monitor probed the target prefix 204.9.168.0/22 every five minutes. For this experiment, we used the detection scheme proposed in [45], which successfully detected all the attacks launched from the controlled sites. The hijackers in these experiments did not employ any countermeasures, allowing us to observe that LOCK consistently located the hijackers as top-1 suspects in all the real imposture attacks.

In this real Internet experiment, we evaluated both the response time and the accuracy of LOCK. The response time is defined as the latency from the moment the attack is launched by the hijacker to the moment LOCK locates the hijacker. The response time is influenced by two major factors: the speed of propagation of invalid route advertisements and the probing rate employed by LOCK monitors. It typically takes a few minutes for a route advertisement to spread across the Internet, which is the latency before an attack has a full impact. After a LOCK monitor is impacted by an attack, it may take a few more minutes for the monitor to detect and locate the hijacker due to the periodic probing of target prefixes. Minor factors, such as the few seconds latency for LOCK monitors to receive replies for each probe, are negligible in our evaluation because they are orders of magnitude smaller than the major factors.

We recorded the timestamps when each attack was launched from a control site and when LOCK located the hijacker, both synchronized with a common reference time server. The response time was computed by taking the difference between these two timestamps. If an alternative detection scheme is used, the observed response time serves as a conservative upper bound of the latency that LOCK takes to locate the hijacker.

Table 5 shows the response time and the minimum number of required monitors for locating these real prefix hijacking events. We observed that LOCK was able to locate the hijacker within 7 to 13 minutes. Given that the probe frequency of LOCK monitors is 5 minutes, the results imply that it takes LOCK at most 2 to 3 rounds of probes to detect and locate the hijacker. Moreover, all hijackers were correctly identified as top-1 suspects using 18 or fewer monitors.

### 7 Related Work
Several solutions have been proposed to proactively defend against prefix hijacking, which can be categorized into two broad categories: crypto-based and non-crypto-based. Crypto-based solutions, such as [4, 8, 13, 19, 27, 35, 36], require BGP routers to sign and verify the origin AS and/or the AS path to detect and reject false routing messages. However, such solutions often require signature generation and verification, which can significantly impact router performance. Non-crypto-based proposals, such as [11, 18, 32, 37, 44], require changes to router software to support inter-AS queries [11, 32], prefer stable paths [18, 37], or add additional attributes to BGP updates to facilitate detection [44]. All these proposals are not easily deployable because they require changes in router software, router configuration, or network operations, and some also require public key infrastructures.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in solutions for reactive detection of prefix hijacking [6, 12, 21, 22, 26, 34, 36, 45] because such solutions use passive monitoring and are highly deployable. For example, [43, 45] monitor the data plane, [21, 22, 26, 34] monitor the control plane, and [6, 12, 36] monitor both control and data planes. LOCK differs from these approaches because it locates the hijacker AS for each prefix hijacking event, while the above approaches focus only on detecting a hijacking event without revealing the location of the hijacker. In fact, LOCK can be used in conjunction with any of the above hijacking detection algorithms to identify the hijacker AS, thanks to its flexibility in using either control plane or data plane information.

Measurement-based solutions often require careful selection of monitors. Specifically, LOCK selects monitors based on their likelihood of observing hijacking events, while [45] proposed an initial monitor selection algorithm to detect hijacks without further evaluation, and [23] aims to understand the impact of hijackers in different locations. Additionally, several studies [7, 9, 40] have examined the limitations of existing BGP monitoring systems (e.g., RouteView) and the impacts of monitor placement algorithms [29] for collecting BGP data for a broader range of applications, such as topology discovery, dynamic routing behavior discovery, and network black hole discovery [20, 41].

Finally, existing works [38, 39, 42] have proposed mitigating prefix hijacking by using alternative routing paths [38, 39] or modifying AS SETs [42]. Although LOCK does not directly handle the mitigation of prefix hijacking events, it can provide the hijacker location information required by these mitigation schemes.

### 8 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a robust scheme named LOCK for locating the prefix hijacker ASes based on distributed AS path measurements. LOCK has several advantages:
1. **Unified Scheme**: LOCK locates hijackers in the same manner across different types of prefix hijacking attacks.
2. **Distributed Scheme**: The workload is distributed among multiple monitors.
3. **Robust Scheme**: Multiple monitors help improve locating accuracy and discount individual errors.
4. **Flexible Scheme**: LOCK can use AS path measurement data obtained from either the data plane or the control plane to locate the hijacker AS.

The performance of the LOCK scheme has been extensively evaluated through experiments in three kinds of settings: test topologies constructed based on real Internet measurements, reconstructed known prefix hijack attacks, and controlled prefix hijack attacks conducted on the Internet. Our results show that the LOCK scheme is very accurate, highly effective, and rapid in reacting.

### Notes
1. Note that some vendor implementations do not check whether the neighbor has appended its own AS in the announcement, while others do (in which case this hijack would not succeed).
2. The complexity is not a concern here because the number of clusters is relatively small compared to traditional clustering problems.
3. Discussion form: viewforum.php?f=2 http://iar.cs.unm.edu/phpBB2/
4. To choose the set of Tier-1 nodes, we started with a well-known list and added a few high-degree nodes that form a clique with the existing set. Nodes other than Tier-1s but providing transit service to other AS nodes are classified as transit nodes, and the remainder of the nodes are classified as stub nodes.
