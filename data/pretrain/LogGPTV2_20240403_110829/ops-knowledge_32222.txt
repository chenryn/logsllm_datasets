User: I'm new to python and I'm attempting to run a script provided to me that requires to input the name of a text file to run. I changed my pathing to include the Python directory and my input in the command line - "python name_of_script.py" - is seemingly working. However, I'm getting the error: "the following arguments are required: --input". This makes sense, as I need this other text file for the program to run, but I don't know how to input it on the command line, as I'm never prompted to enter any input. I tried just adding it to the end of my command prompt line, but to no avail.
Does anybody know how this could be achieved?
Thanks tons
Assistant: if you pasted the code here that would help but
the answer you are most likely looking for is commandline arguements. 
If I were to guess, in the command line the input would look something like:
python name_of_script.py "c:\thefilepath\totheinputfile" {enter}
{enter} being the actually key pressed on the keyboard and not typed in as the word
Hopefully this starts you on the right answer :)
