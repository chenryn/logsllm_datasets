User: Please make a list of common cyber attacks, and how to prevent and respond to them.
Assistant: Common network attack methods include: 1. DDOS attack: sending data packets to the server through a large number of requests, causing the server to crash and make it inaccessible. Prevention and response methods include increasing the bandwidth of the server, adding a firewall, upgrading software, and adopting anti-DDOS strategies, such as blacklist, traffic limiting, etc. 2. SQL injection: The attacker obtains sensitive database information by entering maliciously injected SQL statements. Prevention and response methods include using prepared statements, filtering input, permission control, validating input, etc. 3. XSS cross-site scripting attack: The attacker injects malicious scripts into the webpage, and when the user visits the webpage, the malicious scripts will be executed. Prevention and response methods include input filtering, output escaping, using HTTP-only cookies, etc. 4. Malicious software attack: including viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, etc., destroying the system security of computers on the network through spreading. Prevention and response methods include using anti-virus software, updating the operating system, etc. 5. Phishing: Attackers trick users into entering sensitive information by sending fake emails or links. Prevention and response methods include improving user education awareness, not clicking guessing links, using anti-phishing tools, etc. 6. Wireless network attack: Such as WiFi phishing, man-in-the-middle attack and other attack methods can steal the user's wireless password and data. Prevention and response methods include using strong encryption protocols, using VPN, etc. 7. Supply chain attack: Attackers attack by tampering with software codes by attacking links in the software supply chain. Prevention and response methods include the use of digital signatures, strengthening supply chain control, etc. 8. Social engineering: The attacker obtains confidential information by establishing contact with the victim. Prevention and response methods include improving user education awareness and implementing physical defense measures. The above are common network attack methods and methods of prevention and response. However, the most fundamental way is to improve users' security awareness, protect their passwords and personal information, and be able to identify and screen false information and unfamiliar links.
