User: I am trying to add the Python 2.7 bin folder to my path in order to run elastic beanstalk. Here is some output from my Terminal:
➜  ~ echo $PATH
~/Library/Python/2.7/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
➜  ~ ~/Library/Python/2.7/bin/eb --version
EB CLI 3.8.9 (Python 2.7.1)
➜  ~ eb --version
zsh: command not found: eb
And here is my export statement in .zshrc:
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
export PATH="~/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH"
Can anyone tell me what's wrong? EB seems to be installed fine, and the path variable seems to point to it.
Assistant: The tilde character wasn't being expanded within the double-quoted string. If you had tried to execute "~/Library/Python/2.7/bin/eb" --version in your second example it wouldn't have worked either.
You could have set your path using something like export PATH="/Users/peter/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH", or potentially export PATH=~/"Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH" (notice the tilde is outside the double-quotes.) I'd prefer the former, however.
