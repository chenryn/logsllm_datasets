User:  company's website needs to support high concurrency, and you need to provide a feasible load balancing solution. Please consider factors such as network topology and load balancing algorithm.
Assistant: For a company whose website needs to support high concurrency, a feasible load balancing solution is as follows: 1. Network topology design: In terms of network topology, a three-layer structure design can be used, namely the core layer, aggregation layer and access layer. At the core layer, two or more switches can be stacked or aggregated to provide higher reliability and throughput. On the aggregation layer, multiple switches can be used for link aggregation and redundancy to improve reliability and flexibility. On the access layer, multiple switches can be used for link aggregation and redundancy to support connection and load balancing of multiple servers. 2. Selection of load balancing algorithm: In terms of load balancing algorithm, you can choose algorithms such as round robin, random, and minimum number of connections based on the client IP address to balance the load of client requests. In addition, load balancing can also be performed based on URL path, HTTP header information, etc., so as to better handle different request types. 3. Application service architecture: In the application service architecture, cluster or distributed architecture can be used to support high concurrency. In a cluster architecture, multiple servers can serve as a virtual server to increase availability, handle concurrent requests, and more. In a distributed architecture, different servers can handle different functional modules in order to better separate application functions and improve scalability. 4. Disaster recovery backup: Finally, in order to improve service reliability and fault tolerance, a strategy for disaster recovery backup is required, including data backup, hardware backup, architecture design, etc. For example, master-slave architecture, active-active architecture, etc. can be used. To sum up, the above is a feasible load balancing solution, which needs to be designed and implemented according to the actual situation.
