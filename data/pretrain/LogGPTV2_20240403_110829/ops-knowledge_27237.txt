User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Acrobat Reader XI addon gets disabled periodically in Internet Explorer within Windows domain We have a followig problem that happens on new workstations with Windows 7 x64 and Acrobat Reader XI only.

Every few days the following key is automatically added to registry:

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Ext\Settings\{CA8A9780-280D-11CF-A24D-444553540000}


This key has the effect that Acrobat Reader XI gets disabled in Internet Explorer add-ons.
So when user opens PDF in IE (or SAP or other Windows software using IE), it is not opened within IE but in a new separate window.



All the client workstations use Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 and Microsoft System Center Endpoint protection as antivirus solution.

Can you please suggest what can be the reason for this, like group policy, antivirus etc.?

Assistant: Group Policy could be adding that registry value. The gpresult tool can give you insight into the settings being applied via Group Policy.

Any program running as the user could be doing it, because users have rights to modify that part of the registry by default. Being that it's changing "Every few days" I suspect it's not Group Policy that's doing it (since policy refresh happens more frequently than that).

I'd consider enabling auditing on the HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Ext\Settings registry key and watching the Security Event Log to catch the modification. (I don't hasten to link to blogs, however the procedure in this entry is nice because it doesn't involve making changes to audit policy via Group Policy, which most of Microsoft's official examples do.)

You'll probably also want to enable process tracking auditing to get a clear picture of what processes are involved in the modification.
