Seventh Workshop on Hot Topics in System Dependability
(HotDep’11)

We are pleased to present to the community the
proceedings of HotDep’11, the seventh instance of
the HotDep workshop series. The goals of Hot-
Dep are to bring forth cutting-edge research ideas
spanning the various domains of dependable sys-
tems, and to build linkages between two communi-
ties with active interest in dependability research,
namely researchers who attend traditional depend-
ability conferences such as DSN and ISSRE, and
those who attend mainstream systems conferences
such as SOSP, OSDI, and EuroSys. To achieve
these goals, the workshop has been alternating be-
tween a dependability conference in odd years and
a systems conference in even years. This year,
we have kept the tradition of previous meetings by
selecting a program committee with a mix of re-
searchers from both communities:
• Lorenzo Alvisi, University of Texas at Austin
• Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau, University of Wiscon-
sin, Madison
• Byung-Gon Chun, Intel Labs Berkeley
• Arun Iyengar, IBM Research
• Mohamed Kaˆaniche, LAAS-CNRS
• Daniel Moss´e, University of Pittsburgh
• Priya Narasimhan, Intel Labs/Carnegie Mel-
lon University
• James Plank, University of Tennessee
• Andr´e Schiper, EPFL
• Alexander Shraer, Yahoo! Research
• Atul Singh, NEC Labs, Princeton
• Marco Vieira, University of Coimbra
• Lidong Zhou, Microsoft Research Asia,
Beijing
HotDep’11 received twenty submissions, a number
that is consistent with previous meetings. The top-
ics included traditional fault tolerance at the hard-
ware level, software reliability, intrusion detection
and tolerance, and general dependability in net-
works and storage. Each paper received at least
three reviews and was thoroughly discussed during
the program committee meeting, regardless of its
numerical scores. The program committee meet-
ing took place in cyberspace on April 11th, 2011.
The meeting resulted in the acceptance of eleven
papers into the program. An additional six papers
were chosen for presentation as posters. Keeping
in mind that the intent of the meeting is to max-
imize the interactions among participants, we de-
cided that the poster session should also include the
eleven accepted papers, allowing more time for dis-
cussions.
We would like to acknowledge several col-
leagues who helped with formulating the program.
First of all, we would like to thank the authors for
their contributions, and we hope that they will ﬁnd
the program rewarding. We would like to thank the
program committee members for the high-quality
reviews and for their effort during the discussion,
especially those who agreed to attend the meeting
despite the fact that it was being held at an inconve-
nient time in their respective time zones. We would
like to thank the conference organizers, especially
Michael Lyu and the general workshop chairs for
their ﬂexibility and accommodation. Finally, we
would like to thank the steering committee of the
workshop for giving us the opportunity to serve the
community and to put together this program.
This year’s program is available online at

previous years.
