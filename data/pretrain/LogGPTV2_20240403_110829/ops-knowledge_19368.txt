Question: In the context of x86 assembly, certain registers are designated to hold addresses that point to specific sections of the memory associated with a program's execution. Given the three special x86 registers, eip, ebp, and esp, match each register with the section of C memory it typically points to during program execution:
"A": "eip points to the current instruction in the code section.",
"B": "ebp points to a variable in the static section.",
"C": "esp points to the top address of the current stack frame in the stack section.",
"D": "eip points to the bottom address of the heap section."
Answer: AC
