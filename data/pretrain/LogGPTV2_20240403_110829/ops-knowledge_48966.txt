User: I installed pip-8.1.1. The windows prompted that it was successfully installed. After I added 'C:\Python27\Scripts;' to Path in System Variables, the system still couldn't recognize 'pip' as a command.
Here is the error message: 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
How do I correctly add pip to Path?
Assistant: Try opening a new command prompt and run pip from that. Sometimes changes to environment variables don't propagate to already-open prompts.
