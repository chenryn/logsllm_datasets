minutes, we added one more risk to the scenario and took time again. When the
threshold of 10 minutes was reached, we took note of the last scenario size that
was solvable. These measurements were done for various values of the rounding
parameter a and the results are shown in ﬁgure 4.13 as well as table 4.5.
The visualization in ﬁgure 4.13 shows that there is a linear relationship between
the rounding parameter a and the size of a scenario that can be analyzed within ten
minutes. The estimated relationship is #risks ≈ 20.5026 · a + 9.1801. The really
high R2 statistic of 0.9995 supports the hypothesis of a linear relationship. This
means that rounding all parameters to the next multiple of ten would lead to 207−
42 = 165 more risks that can be incorporated into the risk management process.
Table 4.5 lists the measured solvable size as well as the predicted solvable size
of a scenario (based on the estimated relationship equation) for a given rounding
parameter a.

4.3.1 Dynamic Posted Pricing Service
4 Risk Quantiﬁcation Framework
This section contains the scenario illustration, the description of the identiﬁed ma-
jor risks, and the results of our model’s application3. The model is used to assess
the aggregated risk as well as the individual cost drivers of the scenario.
4.3.1.1 Scenario Description
The scenario which we use to demonstrate our model’s applicability is based on
the PREMIUM-Services research project4, more precisely on the described func-
tionality of the Dynamic Posted Pricing (DPP) service. The project aims to develop
a service which is offered to online vendors and which can be integrated into their
shops. Based on various inﬂuencing factors, like a product’s durability or a cus-
tomer’s creditworthiness, the DPP service calculates the most efﬁcient individual
price for a product that a customer shows interest in. After login, a customer visits a
vendor’s web page containing products. The most efﬁcient price for some of these
products can be calculated by the DPP service and is displayed to the customer as
a part of an individual product page within the online shop. In the following, we
describe details of the scenario whose corresponding services call graph is shown
in ﬁgure 4.14.
1. The Online Shop Pricing (OSP) service determines the most efﬁcient price
using the DPP service. This price depends on different factors, like the cus-
tomer’s location and creditworthiness, and the demand for the product. As a
consequence, the online shop transmits information about the product, e. g.,
past prices, as well as customer data, and the customer’s Internet Protocol (IP)
address, to the DPP service.
2. The DPP service tries to retrieve the customer’s location and therefore sends
the corresponding IP address to the Customer Location (CLo) service.
3. The CLo service returns data about the customer’s location, like the names of
the country, region, and city, or approximated geographical coordinates.
4. The DPP service checks the risk of credit loss using the Customer Rating (CRa)
service. The transmitted data contain information about the customer, like ﬁrst
name, family name, and address.

to the online shop.
4.3.1.2 Descriptions of Identiﬁed Risks
We compare two alternative levels of security for the given scenario, i. e., security
at the transport layer and security at the application layer.
For the ﬁrst security level, we assume that all data are transferred encrypted
using the SSL protocol. As SSL technology is the de facto standard for secure data
transmissions and can easily be applied and largely reduces the risks of eavesdrop-
ping and manipulation, we do not consider less secure mechanisms. However, SSL
solely provides security at the transport layer and does not ensure conﬁdentiality or
integrity at the application layer. Every service receives and processes unencrypted
data and therefore service-related risks can occur with a higher probability.
The second security level provides a higher level of security by applying
end-to-end security mechanisms at the application layer. Customer data, like the
name, address, and IP address, are encrypted by the online shop for the CLo
and CRa services and cannot be read by the DPP service. The DPP service only
forwards the encrypted data to the appropriate services which are able to decrypt
the information. Therefore, the DPP service does not learn the user’s data.
We determined lock-in effects (RS
2), proﬁle gener-
ation (RS
4) as the four major service-related risks.
Table 4.6 shows the model’s parameter values for the different levels of security.

1: The usage of external services that are not provided by multiple providers
creates a vendor lock-in effect because the service consumers are not able to
switch to another equivalent service, and therefore are bound to the only exist-
ing service provider (Jurison, 1995; Aubert and Rivard, 1998; Hansen, 2005;
Lacity et al., 2009). If the provider stops the service, there is no fall-back solu-
tion for the consumers. The probability that lock-in effects occur is the highest
for the DPP service, as no comparable services are offered on the market, while
the probability for the CLo is rather low as there are alternative providers avail-
able which are able to map IP addresses to locations.
2: The more complex a service is, the higher is the probability that it may suf-
fer from performance problems or may even be completely unavailable. The
execution of the CRa service and the DPP service involve more processing
compared to the two other services, and therefore the occurrence probabilities

3: By surveying the data that are send to and received from the CLo and CRa
services, it could be possible for the DPP service’s provider to create detailed
proﬁles of the online shop’s customers. This conﬁdential data could contain
the customers’ identities, addresses, locations, credit ratings and visited product
pages. While this surveying might be possible for security level 1 (with pS
=
0.2), it is no longer possible if the online shop uses end-to-end encryption so

=
0.002 for security level 2 because the DPP service in-between cannot decrypt
the data.
4: A malicious DPP service could relay conﬁdential customer information to
third parties, resulting in high losses due to data breaches. We estimate that
the loss or theft of personal information could result in the highest total costs
among our identiﬁed major risks. These costs include investigating the breach,
notifying customers, restoring security infrastructures as well as recovering lost
business (Ponemon, 2009; Cavusoglu et al., 2004b). Like RS
3, this risk can be
largely reduced for the DPP service by using end-to-end encryption (i. e., secu-
rity level 2).
Furthermore, we determined eavesdropping of customer data (RT

1 : The major data transfer-related risk is eavesdropping of customer data. Es-
pecially the invocations of the DPP or the CRa service are interesting for attack-
ers because the transmitted data include conﬁdential information like name and
address. The occurrence probabilities for eavesdropping decrease when end-to-
end encryption is used. Therefore, at security level 2, the data transfers 1, 2,
and 4 are protected by two security measures: the SSL protocol and end-to-end
encryption. The risk of eavesdropping is associated with the highest cost of all

data transfer-related risks because leakage of sensitive customer data might be
associated with lost customers, damage to the brand and company image, legal
cost and penalties as well as employee downtime (Ponemon, 2009; Cavusoglu
et al., 2004b).
2 : Via intelligent manipulation of the customers’ credit ratings, it might be
possible for an attacker to inﬂuence the pricing calculations in the DPP service
which would result in diverging prices that are displayed to the customers. The
credit rating is only part of data transfer 5 which does not use additional secu-
rity at the application layer because the DPP service needs to process the data
of the CRa service in order to calculate the price. Therefore, the occurrence
