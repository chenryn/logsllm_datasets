# Brief Summary
https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/v5.2.7/celery/backends/dynamodb.py#L204  
This always calls CreatTable even the table existed already.  
Each call will have an AWS CloudTrail management event for CreateTable API
call with ResourceInUseException error.  
Each CouldTrail management event cost 0.00002 USD in AWS US West (Oregon)
region.  
I have 10M+ tasks everyday and they produce 10M+ such events, and AWS charges
me for 200+ USD.
# Design

## Proposed Behavior
Just like what proposed in #6622, check existence of table with another boto3
call first instead of just calling create table
