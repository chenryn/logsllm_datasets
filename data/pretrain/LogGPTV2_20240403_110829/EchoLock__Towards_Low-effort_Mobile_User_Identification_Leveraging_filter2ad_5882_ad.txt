### 7.2 Posture Stabilization Detection

EchoLock is designed to initiate the identification process through various user actions, ensuring a seamless and low-effort experience. The system can be triggered by common actions such as picking up or grabbing the device, which are already supported in existing APIs for iOS and Android. However, initiating acoustic sensing immediately after these actions can lead to the recording of unnecessary audio, such as shuffling items or accidental collisions while the user is moving their hand.

To address this, EchoLock only initiates sensing when the device's movement has stabilized. If the device is still in motion, the user may be adjusting their grip, leading to external sensor readings that monitor this behavior. For smartphones and tablets, we leverage built-in motion sensors like gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers to track the motion path. We compute the variance of this path over a sliding interval (e.g., every 0.1 seconds) and compare it to a pre-determined threshold to determine when major hand or arm movements have ceased. This ensures minimal disturbances from non-acoustic sources.

### 7.3 Environmental Noise Removal

Our system captures the transmitted \( n \)-chirp sequence as an audio recording using on-board microphones, which may also pick up ambient noise and high-frequency distortions. While naturally occurring sounds from daily activities, such as movement or light conversation, are unlikely to interfere with the inaudible frequency range used by EchoLock, noise can still be introduced due to speaker imperfections, loud public spaces, or malicious actions by attackers.

To mitigate this, we filter the obtained recording before detailed signal processing. Specifically, we design a band-pass filter with a passband from 18 kHz to 22 kHz, which is the expected frequency range of the transmitted chirp signal. We use a Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filter at the specified frequencies, employing a third-order filter to minimize passband ripple and avoid distorting the biometric information embedded within the signal.

### 7.1 Sensing Microphone Selection

Modern mobile devices, particularly smartphones, often come equipped with multiple on-board microphones for noise cancellation during phone calls. These devices also typically have multiple speakers, usually located at the extremities to reserve central space for screens or buttons. We find that the reception of acoustic signals from the speakers can vary significantly depending on the microphone and speaker positions.

For example, adjacent speakers and microphones generally gather less structural information due to the short propagation path. In contrast, microphones and speakers positioned at opposite ends provide more structural information. To optimize performance, we select the most suitable microphone-speaker combination for each device.

### 8 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

We evaluate the performance of EchoLock in various common use case scenarios and on several mobile devices. Our experiments test the system's ability to lock or unlock access to mobile devices, as approved by our institute's IRB. Below, we present our findings and detailed analysis.

#### 8.1 Experimental Setup

**Devices and Scenarios:**
- A prototype application for EchoLock was developed for Android.
- Three smartphones (Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Galaxy Note 5) and two tablets (Galaxy Tab A, Lenovo Tab 4) were selected for their varied designs and dimensions.
- Smartphones have two onboard microphones, while tablets have one.
- We evaluated the system in typical office and public scenarios, maintaining average noise levels of approximately 30 dB and 60 dB, respectively.
- Public environments include nearby conversations, walking, and dining.
- We also assessed the impact of accessories like gloves or smartphone cases and the viability of adversaries compromising the system.

**Data Collection:**
- We conducted 10 use case experiments, divided into three categories:
  1. Identifying the current user holding the device.
  2. Performance in a public environment.
  3. Usage via indirect physical contact (e.g., with a protective case or gloves).
- We recruited 20 volunteers (14 males, 6 females, ages 18-35) and collected 40 \( n \)-chirp sequences (where \( n = 10 \)) for each test case, totaling 80,000 hand geometry samples.
- The profiles of all volunteers collectively act as negative labels during classification, except for the target user undergoing identification.

#### 8.2 Evaluation Metrics

We describe the accuracy of our system by evaluating precision, recall, and using standard ROC curves. Precision is defined as the percentage of True Positive (TP) classifications out of all positive classifications, notated as \( P = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \). Recall is defined as \( R = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \), or the percentage of true positive classifications out of all target class instances. Higher precision indicates a lower probability of different people being mistaken for the legitimate user, while higher recall indicates a lower probability of the legitimate user being misidentified. The ideal system has a 100% TP rate and 0% FP rate.

#### 8.3 User Identification Performance

From our signal processing procedures, we obtain features used to identify the user and present them to a machine learning classifier. We considered Bagged Decision Trees (BDT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as candidate classifiers. SVM with a cubic kernel function demonstrated the strongest performance. We used 10-fold cross-validation, allocating 50% of the data for training and 50% for testing. Figure 10 shows the system's capability to correctly identify the legitimate user, with an average TP rate of 94% for a 5% FP rate across different mobile devices.

#### 8.4 Attacks on User Credentials

**Impersonation Attacks:**
- We evaluated the possibility of attackers impersonating other users' hand profiles to gain unauthorized access.
- In the worst-case scenario, we trained the system on a limited sample size (5) for the victim user and allowed informed attackers to observe and imitate the hold.
- Results suggest that visual observation alone is insufficient for successful impersonation, with FPR as low as 6% for a 90% TP rate on devices like the Nexus 5.

**Eavesdropping and Replay Attacks:**
- We assessed the viability of eavesdropping information during standard usage.
- Experiments showed that EchoLock correctly recognized each victim and blocked attackers using eavesdropped \( n \)-chirp sequences.
- Recorded signals suffer from significant attenuation and loss of genuine structure-borne properties, making it difficult for attackers to compensate without intimate knowledge of the authentic signal.
