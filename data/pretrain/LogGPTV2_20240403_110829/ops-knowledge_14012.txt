Question: A cybersecurity analyst is investigating an incident where a sophisticated malware strain was deployed within the organization's network. The malware exhibited a behavior where it would only execute under certain conditions, such as the presence of specific files and network configurations. This behavior prevented the malware from executing in unintended environments. Based on this scenario, what is the purpose of this conditional execution constraint employed by the malware authors?
"A": "To ensure that malware propagates to as many systems as possible within the target network.",
"B": "To prevent the malware from executing in virtualized or sandboxed environments for analysis.",
"C": "To limit the malware execution to intended targets and reduce collateral damage from the campaign.",
"D": "To evade signature-based detection by altering the malware's behavior based on the environment."
Answer: C
