Commit `b149be5` specifically removed all processing of non-HTTP(s) URLs.
Previous to this commit if you were to pass in params, it would be appended to
the URL. Since this commit it no longer works. Specifically I ran into this
issue when running docker-py against a unix socket.
I understand that for non standard URLs you don't want to parse them. It seems
that if the params were passed, then you should still append them. I'll gladly
put in a pull request for this if it seems like a valid issue. A simple fix
would be the below
            # Don't do any URL preparation for oddball schemes
            if ':' in url and not url.lower().startswith('http'):
                encoded_params = self._encode_params(params)
                if len(encoded_params) > 0:
                    if url.find('?') == -1:
                        url = '%s?%s' % (url, encoded_params)
                    else:
                        url = '%s&%s' % (url, encoded_params)
                self.url = url
                return
