A wishes to transmit a message M to receiver B while an eavesdrop-
per E attempts to listen to message M. As A transmits its message
with a power PA dBm, simultaneously, B jams A’s transmission by
Figure 1: JamSecure
transmitting a Pseudorandom Noise (PN) sequence with power PB
dBm. The PN sequence is generated afresh for each secure recep-
tion and is known only to B. The eavesdropper E can only overhear
the combination of the message M from A and the jamming noise
from B. The received Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) at E will thus be
PA − PB dB. If PB is high enough, then information-theoretically,
E will not be able to extract any useful information about M. While
B also receives a combination of its own jamming and the message
M, it performs Self Interference Cancellation (SIC), i.e., subtracts
the (known) jamming signal from the received signal, in an attempt
to retrieve M. Since SIC is not perfect in practice, suppose that B
can cancel IC dB of its own signal. Then, the SNR seen by B is
PA − PB + IC dB. If IC is ”high enough”, B will be able to
retrieve the message M from A.
While SIC is conceptually simple, the characteristics of the acous-
tic hardware and channel make it challenging to directly perform
channel estimation for SIC. Instead, as discussed in Section 6.2, we
employ a hybrid ofﬂine-cum-online approach, which works with a
predetermined library of PN sequences, and random combinations
thereof.
As discussed in Section 8, Dhwani’s approach to physical-layer
security can be viewed as a fusion of Wyner’s wiretap model [21]
(by ensuring differential SNR for the intended receiver versus an
attacker) and Shannon’s one-time pad [20] (through the use of a
pseudo-random jamming noise). As such, this approach is not con-
ﬁned to acoustic communication and could, in principle, be em-
ployed in other contexts too, e.g., to enable an RFID reader to se-
curely read a tag.
3.5 Other Aspects of Dhwani
We brieﬂy touch on a couple of other elements of Dhwani’s de-
sign, including pointers to later sections for elaboration.
Figure 2: PSR-SNR Curves for various physical layer modulations
How much jamming is needed? For each physical-layer modula-
tion technique, the SNR at the receiver imposes a theoretical lower
bound on the Bit-Error-Rate (BER), and hence an upper bound on
the Packet Success Rate (PSR) for error-free reception. Figure 2
depicts the best possible PSR that can be achieved for a 256-bit
packet, as a function of SNR, for BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK. The
02468101214161820SNR [dB]Packet Success Probability  BPSKQPSK8−PSK10−510−410−310−2101−165key observation is that in each case, PSR falls very sharply around
a certain SNR threshold; e.g., with QPSK, just a 4dB drop in SNR
(from 6dB to 2dB) causes PSR to fall by 5 orders of magnitude.
In Dhwani we need to ensure that the receiver injects enough
noise that the SNR at the eavesdropper is to the left of the chosen
curve in Figure 2 while, at the same time, the SNR at the receiver it-
self, with the beneﬁt of SIC, is to the right. We discuss how Dhwani
achieves this balance in Section 7.2.
Scrambling the message. Receiving a message with errors might
still leak information by allowing the attacker to retrieve parts of it.
To address this issue, Dhwani uses a scrambler prior to transmitting
the message, which ensures that even a single bit of error in the
scrambled message would result in a large number of bit errors in
the unscrambled message. We repurpose AES, which is designed
for ensuring message secrecy, for scrambling instead (Section 7.1).
4. THE ACOUSTIC CHANNEL
The design of any communication system depends fundamen-
tally on the characteristics of the communication medium or the
communication channel. Speciﬁcally, for Dhwani there are three
key properties that inﬂuence its design: ambient noise, acoustic
channel, and acoustic propagation. In this section, we characterize
these three properties, both qualitatively and quantitatively, through
measurements using various mobile devices in different settings.
4.1 Ambient Noise
A key requirement of Dhwani is that it must operate in public
spaces such as malls and cafes where the ambient (acoustic) noise
can cause signiﬁcant interference. To characterize this interference,
we measured the received acoustic power in a range of environ-
ments such as malls, cafes, and ofﬁce conference rooms at various
times. First we measured the noise ﬂoor of the mobile device in
an isolated, silent room. Next we collected ambient sound samples
on the same device in various venues. Figure 3 depicts the ratio of
ambient sound energy to the noise ﬂoor as a function of frequency
measured on a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone in two public venues –
payment counter at a popular mall, and a cafe during busy hours.
As seen from Figure 3, the ambient noise in both the mall and the
cafe can be signiﬁcantly high – up to 25-30dB (1000 times) above
the noise ﬂoor of the phone at frequencies below 1.5KHz. Even at
frequencies up to 5KHz, the ambient interference can be as high
as 10dB (10 times). This is because while human voices rarely ex-
ceed 1KHz, several public venues (including the ones in Figure 3)
have background music or televisions which contribute to the noise
at higher frequencies. The cafe had a higher ambient noise than
the mall, not only due to human chatter but also because the back-
ground music and television sounds were louder. Beyond 6KHz
however, the ambient interference is almost close to noise levels
and becomes negligible after 8KHz. These observations imply that
6KHz forms a lower limit for the operation of Dhwani.
4.2 The Channel Transformation
When a digital acoustic signal s(k) is transmitted, a distorted
version r(k) is received at the receiver. Speciﬁcally, if the sig-
nal is represented as a sum of M sinusoids, f1, f2,··· fM (Fourier
Transform representation), then in the received signal, each of these
sinusoids experiences frequency-dependent attenuation a(fi), and
phase distortion ∆φ(fi) as follows:

In Eqn 2, the complex number a(fi)ej∆φ(fi) is referred to as the
channel gain at frequency fi.
4.2.1 Frequency Selectivity
Frequency selectivity refers to selective attenuation of certain
frequencies in the transmitted signal. There are two key reasons
for frequency selectivity in Dhwani – microphone/speaker selectiv-
ity and multipath.
Microphone-Speaker Frequency Selectivity. Sound is a mechan-
ical wave. Consequently, speakers and microphones have mechan-
ical components (e.g.,vibrating membranes) required for electro-
mechanical conversion. Frequency selectivity arises because of the
inability of these components to faithfully reproduce tones of cer-
tain frequencies. Even though most mobile phones today allow for
an acoustic sampling rate of up to 44KHz, implying a maximum
operating frequency of 22KHz, their speaker/microphones compo-
nents are typically designed for human speech, and their perfor-
mance degenerates signiﬁcantly at higher frequencies.
Multipath. Multipath (echo) is common in sound propagation and
leads to the superposition of several time delayed (and attenuated)
copies of the transmitted signal at the receiver. The net effect of
multi-path is spreading of the received signal in time, and con-
structive/destructive interference at various frequencies, leading to
frequency selectivity.
Examples of Acoustic Channels. Figure 4 depicts the frequency
response (the function a(f ) in Eqn 1) of a Speaker-Microphone
channel for three different acoustic communication links — a Sam-
sung Galaxy S2 phone to a HP Mini laptop, a Samsung Galaxy S2
to HTC Sapphire and ﬁnally a HP Mini to a Samsung Galaxy S2.
The frequency responses were measured by transmitting tones of
frequencies between 100Hz and 20KHz, from one device to an-
other, while placing the devices within 10cm of each other. The
frequency responses in Figure 4 are normalized to the maximum
power received for any single tone during the course of the mea-
surement.
An ideal frequency response should be a line at 0dB horizontal
to the x-axis, indicating that all frequencies experience the same
overall attenuation from transmission to reception. However, Fig-
ure 4 shows that this is far from being the case. We make two key
observations from the ﬁgure:
• Attenuation at high frequencies: In all cases, we see a signiﬁ-
cant degradation at higher frequencies, especially after 12KHz.
This implies that if we use a frequency band for communication
that spans beyond 12KHz, there will be a signiﬁcant informa-
tion loss corresponding to the part of the band beyond 12KHz.
• Notches: As seen from Figure 4, the frequency responses for
all pairs of devices is extremely uneven and has deep notches
(valleys) in various parts of the spectrum, even at frequencies
much lower than 12KHz. This unevenness causes the shape of
the received waveform to be distorted relative to the transmitted
waveform, resulting in decoding errors.
Based on these observations, we conclude that Dhwani should
avoid frequencies beyond 12KHz while also working around the
notches at the lower frequencies.
Multipath vs. Speaker-Microphone Frequency Selectivity. The
frequency selectivity evident in Figure 4 arises from a combination
of both the characteristics of electro-mechanical components of the
