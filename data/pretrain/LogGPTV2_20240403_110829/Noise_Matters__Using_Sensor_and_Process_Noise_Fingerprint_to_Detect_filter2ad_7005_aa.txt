ABSTRACT
A novel scheme is proposed to authenticate sensors and detect data
integrity attacks in a Cyber Physical System (CPS). The proposed
technique uses the hardware characteristics of a sensor and physics
of a process to create unique patterns (herein termed as fingerprints)
for each sensor. The sensor fingerprint is a function of sensor and
process noise embedded in sensor measurements. Uniqueness in
the noise appears due to manufacturing imperfections of a sen-
sor and due to unique features of a physical process. To create
a sensor’s fingerprint a system-model based approach is used. A
noise-based fingerprint is created during the normal operation of
the system. It is shown that under data injection attacks on sensors,
noise pattern deviations from the fingerprinted pattern enable the
proposed scheme to detect attacks. Experiments are performed on
a dataset from a real-world water treatment (SWaT) facility. A class
of stealthy attacks is designed against the proposed scheme and
extensive security analysis is carried out. Results show that a range
of sensors can be uniquely identified with an accuracy as high as
98%. Extensive sensor identification experiments are carried out on
a set of sensors in SWaT testbed. The proposed scheme is tested on
a variety of attack scenarios from the reference literature which
are detected with high accuracy.

1 INTRODUCTION
A Cyber Physical System (CPS) is composed of a set of actuators,
sensors, controllers and communication networks [24]. Examples of
common CPS are the smart grid, water treatment plant, autonomous
vehicles, and implantable medical devices. Connectivity in a CPS
provides improved monitoring and operation of a physical process.
Such advancements are helpful but also bring up the challenge of se-
cure operation of the connected devices. Ensuring secure operation
in a CPS is an important challenge [7].
Recent research efforts stem from legacy IT infrastructure per-
spective [22]. Network security measures are suggested for the
securing the links between different devices. Network-based in-
trusion detection based traffic pattern is most widely proposed
solution [20, 27]. These methods might work well for legacy IT
networks but there is a physical part to CPS which also plays an
important role in ensuring secure operation. Previously it has been
shown that digital intrusion detection methods fail when attack
originates in the physical domain, as there would be no change in
network traffic patterns [39]. A lot of information is generated at a
sensor in a CPS, which could be attacked in physical domain [39]
or cyber domain [44].
Sensor data is transmitted to a programmable logic controller
(PLC) to take an appropriate action based on the sensor measure-
ment. If an adversary is able to spoof sensor data in the digital or
physical domain, it can take the system to an unsafe state. The
focus here is not on the confidentiality of the data as in legacy
computer security but on the integrity and trustworthiness of
the data [17, 22]. Attacks on sensor measurements have been de-
signed and detection methods have been proposed in recent stud-
ies [2, 33, 36, 38–40, 43, 46]. The physical domain poses a security
threat for a CPS because an attack executed in the cyber domain
can result in catastrophic outcomes in physical space and on the
lives of people [8, 11, 14]. Physical domain brings challenges on
one hand and it can prove to be useful for security if the physics of
the process is utilized. An attacker who tries to defy the rules of
physics should expose itself. An understanding of the physics of
the process can help secure a CPS.
1.1 Our Solution
A novel technique is proposed to identify sensors and detect data
integrity attacks in a Cyber Physical System. The proposed tech-
nique uses the hardware characteristics of a sensor to create unique
patterns (herein termed as fingerprints) for each sensor. The sensor

fingerprint is a function of noise in sensor measurements. Unique-
ness in the noise appears due to manufacturing imperfections. To
create a sensor’s fingerprint, a unique challenge is to answer the
question how can noise be extracted from a sensor’s measurement?
This is challenging as we need to know the real quantity to extract
a noise vector from the sensor data. In process plants, this might
not be straightforward as the amount of quantity keeps changing.
For example, a level sensor in a process plant is used to measure the
level of fluid in a tank. If the level is supposed to stay at a constant
amount, then a set of readings measured by the level sensor can be
considered as the noise of the sensor because we know the ground
truth, that it should return a constant level but because of mea-
surement noise, the readings from the sensor fluctuate. To solve
this issue, we came up with the idea of obtaining a system model
for the process plant which captures the dynamics of the physical
process. By using the system model we can employ an estimator, for
example the Kalman filter, to estimate the future measurement of a
sensor. An estimate of sensor measurement at time k predicts the
next sensor measurement given k − 1 measurements and a model
for system dynamics. We get sensor measurement at time k and
we can calculate the estimated measurement for the time k. The
difference between the two quantities is actually the noise from the
measurements. The difference between sensor measurement (yk)
and an estimate of the sensor measurement ( ˆyk) is termed as resid-
ual (rk) [4, 28, 31]. A machine learning algorithm is used to create
a profile from the noise pattern in the residual.
1.2 How Does the Proposed Technique Work?
A noise pattern based fingerprinting technique is presented. The
proposed technique attributes the received data from sensors to
its associated sensor using the unique fingerprint of each sensor.
Uniqueness in the fingerprint is due to manufacturing imperfec-
tions of a device [13] and a random pattern due to the physical
process. For example, two water level sensors deployed on top of a
tank would exhibit different noise patterns due to manufacturing
inconsistencies (sensor noise component), the rate of water flowing
in and out, and the structure of a tank (process noise component).
The proposed technique can be used as a sensor identification tech-
nique and also as an attack detection technique. If an adversary
tries to send malicious measurement either by using an external
device inside of the system as man-in-the-middle [44] or outside of
the system [39] or changing the sensor [3], it can be detected, as
the noise profile from the injected data would not match with the
reference pattern. In general, it is shown that any attack on sensor
measurements could be detected if it changes the statistics of the
noise pattern. We can identify a sensor using one-to-one match-
ing, i.e. matching the sensor data with its reference profile created
beforehand. A feature vector consisting of eight time domain and
frequency domain features captures the uniqueness of sensor and
process noise-based patterns. A support vector machine (SVM) clas-
sifier is trained and tested for the proposed technique. Experimental
results on a real-world water treatment (SWaT) testbed [26] support
the idea of fingerprinting noise pattern for device identification
and attack detection. Experiments were performed on a total of 18
sensors available in the SWaT testbed and these sensors are indus-
try grade representatives of a general industrial system. Results
demonstrated a minimum sensor identification accuracy of 94.5%.
In [5] we presented preliminary results related to this paper but
there are substantial differences in this work. In [5] we focused on
the idea of noise-based fingerprint and the basis for such finger-
prints. One significant difference is the attacker model. In [5], only
one type of attack was considered while in this work a range of cy-
ber attacks are considered from a set of benchmark attacks [10, 16]
for a real testbed. In this work, a one-class SVM (OC-SVM) clas-
sification is used for attack detection in contrast to preliminary
analysis where a multi-class classifier was used. For the case of
multi-class classification, one has to train a classifier for attack
data too but OC-SVM frees us from this restriction, making it more
usable in case one does not have the attack dataset a priori. Another
major contribution is the analysis of an advanced attacker that tries
to compromise the proposed technique. We provide theoretical
bounds for state deviation under such attacks. A major contribu-
tion of this work is to improve on a major limitation of [5] whereby
that did not detect any advanced attacker with the knowledge of
noise profile and arbitrary injection of spoofed data to sensors. Here,
we provide security proof for the proposed technique. We also ad-
dressed research questions regarding delays in attack detection, the
effects of data size on the accuracy of the classifier and performance
comparisons between different classifier examples. We believe this
is the first work which is based on our novel idea of sensor and

model subspace system identification technique [32] is used. The
resulting system model is the Linear Time Invariant (LTI) discrete
time state space model of the form,
(cid:40)
xk +1 = Axk + Buk + vk ,
yk = Cxk + ηk .
(1)
Where xk ∈ Rn represents the system state, uk ∈ Rp is the control
input and vk ∈ Rn is the process noise at time k. yk ∈ Rm and
ηk ∈ Rm are the sensor measurements and measurement noise
respectively. A, B, C are the state space matrices of appropriate di-
mensions, encompassing the system dynamics. At the time-instants
k ∈ N, the output of the process yk is sampled and transmitted over
a communication channel as shown in Figure 2. The control action
uk is computed based on the received sensor measurement ¯yk (¯yk
is the received sensor measurement at a controller which may or
may not have been attacked). Data is exchanged between different
entities of this control loop and it is transmitted via communica-
tion channels. There are many potential points where an attacker
can hack into the system, for instance, Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM)
attacks at the communication channels and physical attacks di-
rectly on the infrastructure. The focus of this paper is on sensor
spoofing attacks, which could be accomplished through a Man-in-
The-Middle (MiTM) scheme [44] or through hacking into SCADA
systems [1]. After each transmission and reception, the attacked
output ¯yk takes the form,
¯yk := yk + δk = Cxk + ηk + δk ,
(2)
Where δk ∈ Rm denotes sensor attacks. Throughout this paper, we
reserve the variable k ∈ N as the discrete-time index of various
sequences. Then, we construct a Kalman filter which is used to
obtain estimates for the system states and to find the residual vector.
Kalman Filter and Residual: We used the Kalman filter to esti-
mate the state of the system based on the available output ¯yk,
ˆxk +1 = Aˆxk + Buk + Lk
ek +1 =(cid:0)A − LkC(cid:1)ek − Lkηk − Lk δk + vk .
(3)
with estimated state ˆxk ∈ Rn, ˆx1 = E[x(t1)], where E[·] denotes
expectation, and gain matrix Lk ∈ Rn×m. Define the estimation
error ek := xk − ˆxk. For the Kalman filter, the matrix Lk is designed
to minimize the covariance matrix Pk := E[ek eT
k ] (in the absence of
attacks). Given the system model (1),(2) and the estimator (3), the
estimation error is governed by the following difference equation
(4)
If the pair (A, C) is detectable, the covariance matrix converges to
steady state in the sense that limk→∞ Pk = P exists [6]. We assume
that the system has reached steady state before an attack occurs.
Then, the estimation of the random sequence xk , k ∈ N can be
obtained by the estimator (3) with Pk and Lk in steady state. It can
be verified that, if R2 + CPCT is positive definite, the following
estimator gain,
Lk = L :=(cid:0)APCT(cid:1)(cid:0)R2 + CPCT(cid:1)−1
,
(5)
leads to the minimal steady state covariance matrix P, with P given
by the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation:
APAT − P + R1 = APCT (R2 + CPCT )−1

2 SYSTEM AND THREAT MODELS
In this section, we will explain the overview of the proposed tech-
nique. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the proposed technique.
The whole method could be divided into two main functional blocks
i.e. system modeling and machine learning. In the following sections,
the details of each implementation are given.
2.1 System Modeling
The challenge in applying noise-based fingerprinting in a process
plant is that the system states are dynamic. For example, for a
level sensor, if the level of water stays constant, it is simple to
extract the noise fingerprint and construct a noise pattern profile
for that sensor but in real processes, system states keep changing
i.e., fluid level, in a tank keep changing based on actuator actions. It
is thus important to capture these variations as a function of control
actions so that dynamic sensor measurements can be estimated.
To achieve this objective there is a need to obtain an analytical
model for the control system. The state model actually captures the
system dynamics and can predict future sensor measurement.
System Dynamics: In Figure 1, the first block represents data col-
lection from a cyber physical system. In this work, a dataset from
a real water treatment testbed called SWaT [26] is used. SWaT is
open to CPS security researchers for experiments. More details
on experimentation setup and the SWaT testbed are provided in
Section 4. Data was collected over a period of seven days during
which the plant ran as per normal. This real-time dataset (RTDS) is
composed of data from all sensors and actuators. To obtain a system
