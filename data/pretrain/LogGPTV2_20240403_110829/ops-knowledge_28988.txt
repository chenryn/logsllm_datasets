Assistant: The basic structure of an HTTP request includes three parts: request line, request header and request body. The request line includes the request method, request URL, and protocol version. The request method is used to specify what the client wants the server to do with the resource. Commonly used request methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, etc. The request URL indicates the address of the requested target resource. The protocol version indicates the version of the HTTP protocol used by the client. The request header includes a series of key-value pairs to pass information about the request, such as Host, User-Agent, Accept, etc. The Host field specifies the host name and port number of the server. The User-Agent field specifies the name of the client software sending the request. The Accept field specifies the resource types that the client can handle. The request body is used to send data to the server, such as form data, files, etc. It usually appears in POST requests. The format of the request body depends on the Content-Type field in the request header. Common Content-Types include application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, application/json, etc. Here is a complete example HTTP request: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome /58.0.3029.81 Safari/537.36 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8 Connection: keep-alive In this example, the request method is GET, and the request URL is /index.html, The protocol version is HTTP/1.1. The request header includes Host, User-Agent, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language and Connection fields. The request body is empty.
