various reasons contribute to this mismatch:
1. Incomplete coverage by blacklists. As blacklists are not exhaustive ora-
cles, we expect that certain domains in a campaign may simply not have been
picked up by the speciﬁc set of blacklists used.
2. Not abused. It is possible that a number of campaign registrations simply
has not been used for malicious purposes (yet).
3. False positives. Some of our campaign criteria might not be strict enough,
introducing false positive matches.
Figure 5 depicts in red the percentage of registrations for each individual cam-
paign that appears on a blacklist. There are three campaigns with less than 60% of
their registrations blacklisted: c 05, c 11 and c 15. In the remainder of this section
we validate the quality of the campaign selection criteria. We attempt to gauge the
real false positive rate by inspecting domains belonging to campaigns, but do not
appear on blacklists. A high false positive rate would imply that the selection cri-
teria are imprecise and include a signiﬁcant set of domains that were registered
without any malicious intent. In contrast, a very high true positive rate implies
that the selection criteria are substantially more exhaustive in deﬁning domains
with malicious intent compared to blacklisting services.
Transitive Attribution. To assess the prevalence of incomplete blacklists and
not-active malicious domains, we examine the registrant data of false positives
in order to ﬁnd undeniable traces that connect them to malicious domains. We
base this transitive attribution on phone numbers as these are uniquely assigned
identiﬁers that were never used in our campaign selection criteria. Thus, if the
registrant’s phone number is identical to that of a blacklisted registration, we
consider the domain name to be part of the malicious campaign and assume
that it has either not been abused yet, or was not picked up by a blacklist. In
total, 3,252 campaign domains are transitively considered as malicious. As shown
in yellow in Fig. 5, 14 of the 20 identiﬁed campaigns are thereby completely
validated.
A threat to using phone numbers to identify malicious registrants arises
when an attacker retrieves the WHOIS information of a legitimate .eu domain
and falsely uses it for his own registration. With three small experiments, we
try to invalidate the presence of this scenario in the transitive attributed set.
Firstly, we measure the time interval between the registration time of a transi-
tively attributed domain and of the blacklisted domain that it was associated
with. We ﬁnd that for 2,058 domains, the malicious registration (with the same
phone number) occurred within 60 s of the transitively attributed registration.
We argue that it is virtually impossible for an attacker to observe a new regis-
tration (which is non-public information in the .eu zone), query its WHOIS data
480
T. Vissers et al.
and subsequently make a similar registration in that time interval. In a second
experiment, we argue that an attacker would not exploit a benign registrant’s
information if those contact details are already tainted. In that regard, we ﬁlter
out 965 of the remaining domains that were registered after a prior registra-
tion with the same phone number was already blacklisted. Lastly, we consult a
phone number veriﬁcation tool [22] and identify invalid phone numbers for 189
of the 229 remaining domains. We presume that a malicious actor would not
steal benign registrant details with an invalid phone number while attempting
to mimic a legitimate registrant. In the end, we observe one of these three indi-
cators for 3,212 (98.77%) of the transitively attributed domains and conclude
that this attribution is justiﬁed.
In-Depth Analysis of Campaign C 15. After the transitive attribution step,
still 30.6% of the registrations in campaign c 15 remain potential false positives.
This set of domain names is further investigated.
Within campaign c 15, all domain names are composed of concatenated
Dutch words (mostly 2 words, but sometimes up to 4). The same words are
frequently reused, indicating that a limited dictionary was used to generate the
domain names. The remaining 583 potential false positives domain names were
split up by a native Dutch speaker in segments of existing words. 396 of these
unﬂagged domain names turned out to be exclusively constructed out of Dutch
words used in blacklisted domains of the campaign. As this is a very speciﬁc
pattern, these domains have been labeled as validated true positive. The remain-
ing domain names had either one word segment in common (172 domains) or
no common word at all (15 domains). Thereafter, a new iteration of transitive
attribution strategy was applied on that remaining set. Hereby, 147 registrations
shared a phone number with the previously validated registrations, reducing the
potential false positives to just 40 registrations.
Interstingly, we ﬁnd that 95 out of the 98 registrant names that are used
in c 15 can be generated with on of the Laravel Faker generator tool forks [16]
using its nl-NL language option.
Manual Analysis of the Remaining False Positives. After the transitive
attribution and the analysis of c 15, the residual potential false positives in all
campaigns were further investigated manually, by querying DNS records, visiting
websites, and searching on blacklists (e.g. URLVoid [23]) and search engines.
Only two additional domains could be validated as true positives: one registration
in campaign c 04 was identiﬁed as a phishing website by FortiGuard [6], and one
registration in campaign c 15 sent out unsolicited to a temporary email account
on email-fake.com.
Summary of Validation. Of the 20,698 campaign registrations, 16,704
domains (80.73%) were ﬂagged by blacklisting services, 3,252 registrations
(15.71%) were linked to malicious domains via transitive attribution, and 552
(2.67%) have been manually validated as registered with malicious intent.

Fig. 5. Extended false positive analysis of each campaign. (Color ﬁgure online)
To conclude, the campaign selection criteria resulted in only 190 potential
false positives (i.e. 0.92%). This is a strong indicator that the selection criteria
are suﬃciently accurate to perform a representative analysis and to give us the
necessary insights into the malicious domain ecosystem.
4 Insights into Malicious Campaigns
In this section, we discuss several interesting observations regarding malicious
campaigns, found during our assessment.
Abuse Indicators and Categories. Overall, the vast majority of blacklisted
domains (93.68%) were associated with spam domains. As listed in Table 2, all
campaigns follow this general distribution, except for c 19 where nearly 28% is
linked to botnet C&C servers.
Spamhaus DBL and SURBL are the two abuse sources that cover the largest
number of domains. While there is a considerable overlap, both are required to get
an exhaustive coverage of all campaigns. In particular, c 1 and c 19 are exclusively
ﬂagged by just one of the two sources. Interestingly, Google Safe Browsing was not
involved in ﬂagging domains in any of the campaigns. Presumably, Safe Browsing
focuses more on malware delivery, as opposed to malicious infrastructure.
Cross-Campaign Characteristics. Some interesting characteristics exist
across multiple campaigns. For instance, c 03, c 04 and c 20 generate the reg-
istrant’s email address from its name followed with a numerical suﬃx. Simi-
larly, the registered domain names in c 05 and c 11 follow clear character pat-
terns with numerical suﬃxes. Another returning peculiarity is the discrepancy
between the registrant’s street address and his country. c 07, c 9, c 13 and c 14
use valid street addresses located outside of Europe (US and Panama) in combi-
nation with a European country (Norway, Ireland and others). Presumably, this
is to partly confuse the residential requirements for registering a .eu domain. In

the case of c 10, a ﬁxed street address is listed throughout the campaign while
10 diﬀerent countries are combined with it.
Registration Process is Not Fully Automated. While performing the in-
depth analysis of the malicious domain registrations, we found multiple indica-
tions that the malicious registration process in (at least some of) the campaigns
is not fully automated: syndicates work along oﬃce hours and make human
errors while registering domains.
Oﬃce hours and holiday breaks. As expected, the overall registrations in the
.eu zone follow a weekly pattern. Figure 6 demonstrates this by zooming into
1 month of registrations. During weekends, a signiﬁcantly smaller amount of
registrations occurs than during the week. On average, week days have 2.34
times more registrations than weekend days. For blacklisted registrations, the
diﬀerence is even more prominent. During weekend days, 3.85 times less
malicious registrations occur as compared to weekdays. Moreover, several week-
end days have no blacklisted registrations at all. Table 2 displays this behavior
separately for each campaign.

As already mentioned in Sect. 2, the distribution over time of malicious reg-
istrations is much more ﬂuctuating than those of all registrations (Fig. 1). Inter-
estingly, the longer drops in malicious registration activity coincide with holiday
periods. The most signiﬁcant one starts at the ﬁrst week of July and continues
for several weeks, concurring with the summer holidays. The other major periods
of recess correspond to Labour day weekend (May 1), the Christmas holidays
(last week of December) and the beginning of Lent or Carnival (mid-February).

Fig. 6. Daily share of all and malicious registrations between April 1, 2015 and April
20, 2015. A clear weekly pattern is measured for both.
There are multiple hypotheses to explain these registration patterns:
1. Malicious actors might deliberately mimic normal registration patterns to
avoid detection.
2. There might be a lower demand for new malicious domains during holidays,
when potential victims are less active online.
3. Cybercriminal activities could be managed as any other business and are
therefore equally susceptible to vacation periods.
To substantiate the latter hypothesis, we also zoomed in into the variation
in registration time per campaign. Interestingly, as shown in Table 2 displays
this separately for each campaign, we identiﬁed that some of the campaigns
clearly align with a typical day at the oﬃce. For instance, in campaign c 11 and
c 18 syndicates are working 8 to 10 h a day, and the daily pattern of c 11 even
suggests that there is suﬃcient time to take a lunch break. In contrast, the daily
registration pattern of campaign c 19, further illustrated in Fig. 7, hints at a
more automated process. The vast majority of registrations are made daily at
midnight and 1 PM. Furthermore, campaigns such as c 14 are registering at a
rate up to 132 new domains per minute, suggesting underlying automation.
Minor inconsistencies in the data. We observe a number of inconsistencies in
several registration details of certain campaigns. These inconsistencies could be
the consequence of small errors or typos, suggesting that some of the data has
been manually entered into scripts or registration forms, or that diﬀerent input
validation rules have been applied by registrars or resellers.
