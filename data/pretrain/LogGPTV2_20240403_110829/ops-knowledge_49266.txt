Certainly! Here is the log converted into a more structured and professional format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-12-10T06:55:46",
  "host": "LabSZ",
  "process": {
    "name": "sshd",
    "id": 24200
  },
  "event": {
    "type": "authentication",
    "status": "failed",
    "user": "webmaster",
    "source_ip": "173.234.31.186"
  }
}
```

This JSON format clearly organizes the log data, making it easier to parse and analyze.
