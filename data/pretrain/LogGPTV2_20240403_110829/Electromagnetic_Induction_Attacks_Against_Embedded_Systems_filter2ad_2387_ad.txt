Embedded systems require interconnections between the processor
and sensors. Serial or parallel communication are used for trans-
mission of digital sensor readings. In this work, false data injection
on serial transmission of standard logic levels (3.3 V) between two
microcontroller units is demonstrated.
Injecting false data in digital systems is known to be significantly
challenging [13, 38]. This is because as an attacker it is difficult to
identify when the voltage level should be increased or decreased for
obtaining a logic level change [18]. At the same time, a sufficiently
large voltage swing is required to ensure that a bit flip occurs [39].
However, hardware based false-data injection can be used to affect

maximum interaction with the coupled loop. Then, in the horizon-
tal orientation, greater number of misreads correspond to larger
coupling area of the victim circuit and presence of multiple coupled
flux paths. Consequently, the horizontal alignment is favored for
digital attacks. From our measurements, we realize that the orienta-
tion and placement of the attacker in the victim’s vicinity play an
important role in the success of the attack. Environmental factors
are also an important contributor to successful digital attacks.
From the measurement results we see that the highest percentage
of misreads is about 50% of the time. The misread percentage relates
to the waveform transmitted and the rectification that occurs at
the GPIO pin. As seen in Fig. 8, the logic levels on GPIO pins are
limited to 0 V and 3.3 V. Negative voltages cannot be developed
at the GPIO pin and the lowest voltage obtained on the GPIO pin
is 0 V. Similarly, sinusoidal signals above 3.3 V will be rectified.
Therefore, there is a theoretical limitation of 50% for bit flips i.e., in
some readings the voltage is pulled above the threshold logic level
and in some cases it is pulled low. For similar experiments attacking
the ADC no voltage over 1.5 V was ever observed. Assuming that a
similar amount of voltage was being coupled to the GPIO circuit a
true bit flip could not be accomplished at larger distances. At the
same time this amount of voltage would likely put the logic level
into an undetermined state. This is also a possible explanation for
why no more than 50% of the bits ever flipped.
Table 1 is a summary of the digital misread results. Only the
most effective frequency for a set of data and a comparison between
different alignments at that frequency is shown. From Table 1,
Figs. 7c,7a and 8, it is important to note that bit flips from logic low
to high are easier than logic high to low. This is because CMOS
devices require an increase of approximately 2 V to transition from
a logic low to logic high and a voltage drop of 2.5 V to transition
from a logic high to a logic low.
Finally, our measurement results align well with the theoret-
ical expectations and provide a proof-of-concept demonstration
of an attacker’s ability to remotely change digital signals. As the
demonstrated attack on GPIO signals results in the random flipping
of bits, it remains an open challenge on how to effect high-order
attacks, e.g., targeting specific bits for flipping in a UART trans-
mission (which would also allow an attacker to modify checksum
data so as to ensure that the attacked system digitally validates
corrupted data). Such an attack will require that an attacker devise
a means of synchronizing attack signals to bits and that the attack
signal itself reliably produce bit flips in only the desired direction.
For the former, bit transitions provide sharp peaks that result in
Figure 6: Anechoic chamber with victim and attacker are
placed 5 cm apart: horizontal alignment
connection between the microcontroller and computer. To test the
success of the digital attack the percentage of times that a GPIO
pin read reported an incorrect value was measured (defined as a
GPIO misread).
4.2 Experimental Results and Discussions
The target circuit was placed at a distance of 5 cm from the attacker.
As described in Section 2, the digital attack is sensitive to physical
proximity between the attacker and the victim. By moving the target
further than 5 cm, the potential number of bit flips observed were
extremely low. Additionally, variations in the size of the coupled
loop, introduced by increase or decrease in the separation between
the microcontrollers also affected the frequency dependence and
number of misreads.
Considering the perpendicular orientation of the victim and the
attacker, Figs. 7a and 7b are the measurement results that were
obtained. As seen, the frequencies at which each configuration
responded is different despite the only differences in the setup being
the logical output. From prior discussions in Section 2, we conclude
that the circuit seen by the attacker changes with changes in the
digital logic level. At the same time, as seen in Figs. 5a, 7a and 7b the
frequency range in which maximum misreads occur is comparable
to the frequency range in which maximum analog voltage was
induced. These occurrences can be attributed to maximum resonant
coupling between the attacker and the self-resonance of the victim.
Also of note is that no bits are ever flipped above 400 MHz.
There are likely many contributing factors for no bit flips above
400 MHz. One may be a poor transmission power by the antenna
at these frequencies and another is explained by [7]. In [7] a direct
(i.e., wired) power injection attack on a 16 bit microcontroller is
modeled. They find the power required for a sine wave input to
flip the logical value of a bit vs. frequency. It was found that as the
frequency increased the amount of power required to flip the bit
increased as well. Since all of our attacks are based on sine waves
as well this probably also plays a part.
Figs. 7c and 7d highlight the experimental measurements when
the attacking antenna was placed horizontally in plane with the mi-
crocontroller circuitry. Here it is observed that the misread percent-
ages are much higher in contrast to the perpendicular alignment.
At the same time there is a larger frequency range over which the
misreads occur. Our theory of attack (Section 2) shows that the
maximum effect of the applied H field would occur when there is

attack focuses on the use of PWM as the actuation signal in servo
engine rotation control, however, the attack vector is widely appli-
cable to many systems employing PWM. A PWM signal consists of
a pulsed signal of varying duration with fixed low/high voltages. A
servo, in this work, is a rotary actuator whose angular position is
precisely controlled by the duration of a PWM signal (given in red
and yellow waveforms in Fig. 9). The pulse duration is calculated,
based on rising and falling edges of the signal, by an integrated
microprocessor; the position designated by the PWM signal is com-
pared with the actual position of the servo and a driver current
is generated to rotate the servo engine accordingly. Throughout
this section, the term “PWM duration” is used instead of the high
voltage duration of a PWM signal.
In what follows, an IEMI attack methodology will be introduced
to manipulate the rotation of a servo by changing the duration
of PWM signals. The attack is capable of decreasing the PWM
duration, by inducing a voltage drop, and thus rotating the servo
in one direction (rightmost portion of Fig. 9). The rotation angle
depends on the attack instance and can easily be adjusted by varying
the phase of the attacker waveform VA(t), which will be explained in
detail. We focus on PWM controlled servo engines because of their
wide usage in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems. In future
work, we will explore refined versions of this attack to remotely
influence UAVs.
5.1 Mechanism of Attack
A servo uses PWM duration to rotate to a certain angle; the duration
may be based on the DC mean or the edge time difference of the
signal. To determine the specific duration mechanism employed
by our servo, a voltage drop of varying amplitudes and durations
was applied to a PWM signal using a voltage summer circuit. It
was determined that the internal microcontroller of the servo, a
Futaba S3152, uses the time difference between the positive and
negative edges of the signal to calculate the rotation angle. The
blue waveform in Fig. 9 shows a PWM signal with an added 2.2 V
drop, which causes the servo to observe a 1.5 ms duration signal as
opposed to the legitimate PWM duration of 2 ms. Thus, when the
frequencies of the attacker and the target PWM are locked to each
other, the phase difference between the attack signal and the PWM
can be used to manipulate the rotation angle.

signals which are clipped. Vcc corresponds to logic 1 and

considerable EMI, as per our attack model, that could be detected
at a distance using side-channel analysis, thus enabling an attacker
to discover the bit period and when changes in signalling occur. To
deterministically inject false data (i.e., signals that reliably result in
0->1 and 1->0 transitions) an attacker could transmit signals whose
derivative’s posses negative/positive DC values; e.g., a sawtooth
waveform or the integral of half-/full-wave rectified waveforms.
5 FALSE ACTUATION INJECTION
Actuation signals can be considered as the bridge between the digi-
tal and physically moving portions of embedded systems. Because
the information carried in the actuation signal controls the move-
ment of physical parts, the integrity of the actuation signal is of
utmost significance as malicious alterations could produce cata-
strophic results. For instance, the well-known Stuxnet attack [20]
targeted the programmable logic controllers (PLC) used in the speed
regulation of centrifuges and manipulated the actuation signal to
cause the centrifuges to tear themselves apart.
Pulse width modulation (PWM) is used in many areas of electron-
ics and control, from power delivery to motor-speed control. Our

was ignored as the frequency of the attack signal were well below
the self resonance frequency of the toroid structure; Ratk must
be taken into account as at our operating frequencies (low) the
reactance due to Latk is comparable with Ratk.
The voltage, VL (t), across the lumped inductance representing
the toroid is
VL (t) = Latk

Equation 12 was validated by simulation and experiments. For
simulation, (12) was numerically evaluated, while for our experi-
ments a toroid wrapped with 60 coils of wire and a single loop of
the wire carrying the targeted PWM signal was used. As shown in
Fig. 10, predicted and measured values are largely in agreement; dis-
crepancies in the recovery times may be due to the limited current
supply capability of the signal generator used to transmit VA(t).
The above analysis indicates that the Vatk(t) is linearly related
dt IA(t). Thus, an attacker waveform with a sharp decrease,
to the d
for a very small amount of time, is a good candidate to produce
voltage drops at the target. A sawtooth waveform is just such a
waveform and we therefore selected VA(t) = sawtooth(t) (Fig. 10a).
