Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Previous work
PwC
• Many misunderstandings (Muhlhans, 2017; Vinokur, 2004)
• Significant practical issues (Altmann, 2001)
– Threshold shifts probably not of interest to attackers
– Challenging to cause targeted, directional effects
– LFN: high propagation, low directionality, size restrictions
– HFN: low propagation, size restrictions
• Need close proximity, rapid diffusion (Bartholomew & Perez, 2018)

PwC
• HFN and LFN may be imperceptible to subset of population
• And, above certain levels, may cause adverse effects
• Some consumer equipment can emit HFN and LFN
• Could an attacker develop malware or attacks to:
– Cause a device to emit HFN or LFN…
– … at levels at or exceeding those in maximum permissible guidelines…
– … and therefore cause adverse effects?

Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Our experiment
PwC
• Develop attacks and malware
• Which can control volume and speaker output in consumer devices
• Play/stream tones at a set of high and low frequencies
• Measure output with a sound level meter
• Compare output to maximum permissible levels

Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Our experiment
PwC
• No human subjects involved in experiment
• Ethics exemption granted by UCL Ethics Committee
• Full risk assessment conducted prior to experimentation
• Relevant safety precautions (ear defenders, anechoic chamber)
• Brands/models/code not released, to minimise risk
Ethics

Our experiment
PwC
• Known vulnerability to control audio
• Attacker on local network, or do DNS rebinding attack
• Python script to scan for speakers
• If inactive, stream tone from attacker’s web server at 100% volume
• Then restore volume to original state

Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Our experiment
PwC
• Vibration speakers
– No diaphragm cone
– Uses a coil on a movable plate which pushes against surface
– Smaller profile, possibly attractive as localised acoustic weapons
• Paired over Bluetooth (same as Bluetooth speaker)

• Class I sound level meters
• “Precision grade”: narrower tolerances, wider frequency range
• Spot-calibrated 
• Very expensive
• But you can hire them and send them back via courier
– That awesome time I almost lost ~£20,000

Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Our experiment
PwC
• Each device placed in anechoic chamber with Class I SLM
• Via attacks, played a sine wave tone at 44.1kHz sample rate
• Single frequency (checked with spectrograms)
• Each tone on each device played for 10 minutes
• Surface temperature also measured before/after attack

• Headphones are a significant concern:
– Increasingly used (Henderson et al, 2011)
– At high volumes, by young people (Herrera et al, 2016; Vogel et al, 2007)
• Also device-agnostic to some extent
• Variations of laptop/phone malware could be adapted
– Only trigger sound when headphones are connected
• Audio manipulation attack could also succeed with headphones
