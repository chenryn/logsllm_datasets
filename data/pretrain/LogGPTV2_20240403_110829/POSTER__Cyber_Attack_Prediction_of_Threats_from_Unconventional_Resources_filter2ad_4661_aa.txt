ABSTRACT
This paper outlines the design, implementation and evaluation of
CAPTURE - a novel automated, continuously working cyber attack
forecast system. It uses a broad range of unconventional signals
from various public and private data sources and a set of signals
forecasted via the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model. While generating signals, auto cross correlation
is used to find out the optimum signal aggregation and lead times.
Generated signals are used to train a Bayesian classifier against the
ground truth of each attack type. We show that it is possible to fore-
cast future cyber incidents using CAPTURE and the consideration
of the lead time could improve forecast performance.

1 INTRODUCTION
As computing and networking technologies are being embedded
into our professional and personal activities, the impact of vari-
ous and evolving cyber attacks continues to rise. This calls for an
anticipatory capability to forecast potential cyber attacks before
they happen [5, 6]. Such a capability requires examining beyond
the traditional observables of malicious activities as they occur.
This paper develops an automated, 24x7 system named CAPTURE
that uses a broad range of unconventional signals from public data
sources, including GDELT and Twitter, as well as reported cyber

incidents, to forecast different types of cyber attacks. Signals are
named unconventional as they are not necessarily specific to a tar-
get entity or any cyber attack, but might be indicative for potential
future cyber incidents towards the entity.
Sometimes an attacker is angered by a news release and moti-
vated to launch a cyber attack towards a target entity [1]. Once
the attacker has the intent, it might take some time to have the op-
portunity to execute it. This time could be different for each attack
type due to the reconnaissance needed in the exploration phase or
the responsiveness of the attacker. CAPTURE defines the lead time
(Lt) as the time elapsed between the most recent observation of a
significant signal correlation and the execution of a cyber attack.
On the other hand, using different aggregation periods (At) for a
signal, i. e., aggregating over the last day, week or month could
affect its predictive power.
CAPTURE uses a novel and systematic methodology to deter-
mine appropriate Lt and At for each unconventional signal with
respect to each attack type and each target entity. This paper ap-
plies ARIMA [8] to the reported binary cyber incident data for each
attack type. Whether a specific type of cyber attack occurs each day
is treated as a time series and CAPTURE considers the forecasted
occurrence of each attack type and its associated probability as base
signals to reflect the potential pattern of attack occurrences. The
ARIMA-based signals along with other unconventional signals con-
figured with various Lt and At parameters are used by CAPTURE
to perform an ensemble forecasting of future cyber incidents. CAP-
TURE uses these signals along with the reported cyber incidents to
train a Bayesian model for each attack type of each target entity.
It continually monitors and aggregates the signal data based on
the systematically selected Lt and At, and forecasts future cyber
incidents.
2 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Figure 1 shows the overall system architecture of CAPTURE. Con-
sider a set of attack types A = {A1, A2, ...Am}, a set of target
entities E = {E1, E2, ...Et }, a set of unconventional signals U =
{U1, U2, ...Un}, and a set of Time Series signals V = {V1, V2, ...V2m}.
Using binary observations Bi of each Ai as time series until day
d, ARIMA is applied to forecast the number of cyber attacks that

will occur during the day d + 1. For each forecast a confidence
value in the 95% confidence interval is generated. For each m attack
types, forecasted daily counts and the associated confidences are
used as signals to predict cyber attacks generating 2m Time Series
signals in V . An instance of the CAPTURE architecture as shown
in Figure 1 is created for each Ai and Ei combination. A key to the
CAPTURE design is the ability to identify the optimal lead time and
aggregation level for each signal. To perform this automated fea-
ture configuration a cross correlation is applied between the daily
binary observations of Bi and each signal and the time lags for each
signal are found in terms of days. Using the largest negative time
lag as the lead time (Lti) and the difference between the largest
negative lag and the smallest negative lag as aggregation time (Ati),
the values of each signal are recalculated for each day. If there is
no significant negative time lag, the signal is not used to predict
attacks for Ai. If there is only one negative lag, the lag is used as
At and Lt is set to 0 (See Figure 2). Repeating this process for each
signal in U and V , a new set of signals say Z = {Z1, Z2, ...Zk} are
generated for each attack type Ai where k <= n + 2m. A Bayesian
network is a directed acyclic graph that is composed of k random
variables and e edges that show the dependencies among these
variables.
Let Z = {Z1, Z2, ...Zk} be k random variables (unconventional
signals plus time series signals) with nominal or numeric values
for a Bayesian network. The CAPTURE system trains a Bayesian
classifier for each attack type Ai, using the set of aggregated signals
in Z. Due to the nature of the cyber data, the data sets for some

attack types are highly imbalanced. CAPTURE uses a novel filtering
technique that is applied to the highly imbalanced data sets to make
the data sets more balanced. The technique is named SMOTE++
and is built upon a previous technique called SMOTE [2]. It uses
a combination of the majority under sampling, instance weighing,
and minority over sampling (synthetic instance generation) tech-
niques together. It uses k-means clustering starting with k = 2, and
increments k until a cluster with minority instances is found. Then,
it removes p percent of majority instances that are nearest to the
center of the minority cluster in terms of the Euclidean distance
where the parameter p is tuned. SMOTE++ improves the prediction
performance of the CAPTURE system significantly on some highly
skewed cyber data sets.
2.1 Signals Used
2.1.1 GDELT Signals. GDELT [3] provides the mentions of
events across all of its source documents. Each event has an associ-
ated average tone and it can take a value between -100 (extremely
negative) and +100 (extremely positive).
• GDELT Event Mentions (GEM): The mentions of all events
• GDELT Event Tone (GET): The negative event tones in
• GDELT Event Articles (GEA): The number of GDELT doc-
uments containing one or more mentions of a negative event
are counted.
GDELT are summed up for the requested date interval.
that have a negative average tone are counted.
In GDELT, a numeric score is assigned to each event to capture
the potential impact of the event on the stability of the country
where it occurred (Goldstein scale). Four instability signals are
calculated based on the Goldstein scale, with the hypothesis that
an increase in the instability may result in an increase in the cyber
attack probability. All instability signals are calculated for a given
date interval and the country where the target entity operates.
• Goldstein Event Count (GGC): The number of events as-
• Goldstein Score Average (GGA): The average of the Gold-

stein scores.
scores that are less than zero.
age of scores that are less than minus five.
2.1.2 Twitter Events (TEC). The number of significant mali-
cious events are counted based on the data from a previous study
by Ritter et al. [7].
2.1.3 Level of Mentions of Entities (LME). Increased dis-
cussion of a target entity may indicate an increased surveillance
towards the entity and could lead to increase in the likelihood of
cyber attack towards it. To generate LME, the number of mentions
of the target entity and its related keywords are counted in Twitter.
2.1.4 Sentiment Signals. According to Baumeister et al. a
threat actor could be motivated to launch an attack based on anger
[1]. Indications of outrage towards a target entity could be predic-
tive for cyber incidents towards that entity. Two sentiment scores
(named Affect (AFF) and Intensity (INT)) are used that are calcu-
lated by a private company in the industry for each of the three
target entities, i. e., anonymized K5 company, Defense, and Banking
sectors. Six sentiment signals are used (two for each of the three
targets) represented as K5_AF F, K5_I NT , DEF_AF F, DEF_I NT ,
BAN K_AF F, and BAN K_I NT .
2.1.5 Time Series Signals. Applying ARIMA to the previ-
ously observed binary ground truth data of a given attack type, we
forecast whether a cyber attack will occur at a future date. Using
ARIMA forecasting, two values are generated for the future date,
PosterCCS’17, October 30-November 3, 2017, Dallas, TX, USA2564i. e., the forecasted number of attacks (F) and the confidence asso-
ciated with the forecast (C). These two values are generated daily
for each attack type and used as signals for each trained Bayesian
prediction model.
3 EVALUATION RESULTS
The CAPTURE system is evaluated based on the binary ground truth
data of an anonymized company aliased as K5. The signals defined
in 2.1 are used as inputs for the Bayesian classifier which is trained
against the K5 ground truth on a daily basis. The signals until a date
d are used with a Bayesian classifier to forecast the cyber attacks
for the date d + 1. A separate Bayesian classifier is trained for each
attack type defined for K5, i. e., Malware (MW), Scan, Defacement
(Def), Malicious Email (ME), Malicious URL (MU), and Denial of
Service (DoS). The signals described in 2.1 are generated daily for
all dates between July 1 2016 and Jan 1 2017. For each defined attack
type, an auto cross correlation (CCR) analysis is carried out between
each signal and the binary ground truth of the attack type. Using the
CCR results, statistically significant time lags between the signal
