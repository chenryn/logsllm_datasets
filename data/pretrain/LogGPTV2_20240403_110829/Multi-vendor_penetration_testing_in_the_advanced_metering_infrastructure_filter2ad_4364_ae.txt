AMI System and Communications: Pepco installed a wireless mesh network for the AMI system and 
designed it to be able to route DA traffic through the battery-backed wireless communications devices. 
This approach ensures that DA traffic remains on energized communications devices during power 
outages. The same backhaul cellular network is used to transport AMI and DA data to the appropriate 
collection systems. 
AMI Cost Savings: Pepco in Washington, DC reported AMI cost savings of more than $2 million in 2012, 
at a time when smart meter deployments were not yet fully implemented. Table 7 provides a 
breakdown of these savings.

Reduced Customer Outages and Proactive Transformer Replacement: During 2013, AMI technologies 
helped Pepco prevent over 6,000 customer outages. Pepco has also begun to use AMI data for 
transformer load management. The accuracy of transformer loading data allows for a more proactive 
replacement under a planned outage strategy (as opposed to the prior practice of waiting for 
transformer over-loading, leading to asset failure). Transformer replacement under a planned outage 
results in a lower outage duration than that associated with emergency repairs. 
Customer Savings and Bill Credits: Through 2013, Pepco operated 4 curtailment events, reducing 
demand by 15 megawatts. Participating customers received a total of $1,671,931 in bill credit 
incentives, and each participating customer had a web-programmable thermostat or outdoor direct load 
control switch installed on their  home. The web portal allows customers to view the data collected from 
their smart meters and obtain information about the amount, timing, and costs of electricity usage. The 
web portal also provides the platform for customers to view and control the PCTs.

AMI System and Communications: The Electric Power Board (EPB) deployed a fiber optic network 
enabling two-way communication and data transfer for a new AMI system and DA equipment on over 
half of EPB’s circuits. The project also delivered time-based rate programs to customers to create 
incentives for peak load and overall bill reductions. This infrastructure provided EPB with expanded 
capabilities and functionality to optimize energy delivery, system reliability, and customer service 
options, including an energy management web portal. 
O&M Savings: EPB realized $1.6 million in annual operational cost savings through automation of meter 
reading—one of the largest AMI O&M savings recorded in the SGIG projects. EPB’s full-scale AMI 
deployments included the wholesale conversion of manual processes to automated meter reading and

remote service order fulfillment. EPB lowered operations costs from remote meter reading and 
improved identification of electricity theft. 
Effective Systems Integration Planning: EPB also evaluated water heater load control devices that 
required integration with existing systems to work effectively. EPB conducted several internal 
requirements workshops to design the integration between the CIS, MDMS, and the Distributed Energy 
Resources Management System (DERMS). In addition, EPB extended the integration design to include 
the field installation of devices through its Computer Aided Dispatching system.  
EPB’s electric distribution system, which is over 60 years old, was designed with 115 small substations 
and limited centralized communications architecture. With a 600-square-mile territory and extreme 
annual storms, this lack of connected communications and distribution management capabilities has 
traditionally meant slow response times and labor-intensive outage recovery. With the addition of AMI 
and DA, EPB has turned an antiquated system design into a modern, automated, integrated grid with 
built-in redundancies.

AMI System and Communications: TEC overhauled its microwave communications infrastructure as part 
of its SGIG project. TEC’s legacy microwave communications infrastructure did not have the bandwidth, 
redundancy, and storm resiliency required to support the new AMI system. To meet these needs, TEC 
installed a new primary microwave system, which was designed for 99.999 percent reliability and 
sufficient capacity to support future smart grid deployments.  
Reduced Revenue Shortfall from Prior Manual Meter Reads: TEC had been billing customers since its 
inception in 1940 based on customers reading their own meters and reporting monthly consumption by 
writing the meter reading on the portion of the bill returned with payment, or by phoning the meter 
reading to TEC’s offices. Because of inherent inaccuracies associated with this approach, TEC wrote off 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue shortfall from misreporting, at levels far in excess of 
industry averages. TEC’s AMI investments have eliminated these issues, and have opened new

opportunities for further operational improvements and customer service enhancements. TEC reduced 
its annual meter operations costs by more than $568,000. 
Reduced Bad Debt Write-Offs: TEC decreased its bad debt write-offs from unpaid customer bills by 
about 65 percent since 2011 due in part to its pre-pay program offering, as shown in Figure 11. Typical 
pre-pay programs allow payments to be split between existing balances and future use. From an 
accounting perspective, bad debt write-offs are overdue utility bills that customers are not likely to pay.

AMI System and Communications: A combination radio frequency (RF) mesh and fiber optic cable 
network connects the system wide deployment of smart meters. The network provides the necessary 
communications infrastructure to enable smart grid features such as AMI portal-based customer energy 
management tools and time-based pricing programs. Additional fiber was deployed to connect all 
substations to the control center. DA devices communicate with the substations via a high-speed 
wireless connection. 
On-Demand Reading and Remote Services: AMI has changed completely how Central Lincoln Peoples 
Utility District in Oregon serves its customers. Since billing reads are received daily instead of once a 
month, customers are now able to select their own billing dates. With easier access to daily meter reads, 
customer service representatives are now able to perform on-demand reads, and open or close 
accounts immediately upon a customer’s request. Service can be started or stopped remotely with the 
push of a button, rather than requiring customers to visit an office or the utility to dispatch a vehicle for 
a service call.

CENTRAL LINCOLN PEOPLES UTILITY DISTRICT 
Fewer Truck Rolls and Reduced Meter Operations Costs: Central Lincoln reported a 50 percent 
reduction in meter operations costs in the first year following AMI installation, and reduced truck rolls 
relating to billing reads and connect/disconnects by 85 percent following AMI deployment. 
Improved Outage Detection and System Integration: All Central Lincoln AMI meters are GPS enabled, 
allowing operators to see the exact location of a customer’s outage using meter data. Sometimes trucks 
are rolled before customers call to say they are without power, and service is restored before customers 
who were not at home even discovered they had lost power. The utility recommends developing a 
meter numbering system that includes establishing GPS locations for all meter locations. This step helps 
meter deployments but also makes integrations with OMS and GIS easier to accomplish.  
AMI for Voltage Monitoring and CVR: Central Lincoln uses AMI data to monitor end-of-line voltages. 
Operators sampled voltage data for a subset of customers every 15 minutes on a substation involved in 
a CVR pilot program. From these readings, operators calculate minimum voltages and the average of the 
lowest ten meters (known as the low average indicator). If these voltages are outside the target voltage 
band, operators raise or lower voltage set points on load tap changers in the substation. This pilot 
resulted in 2 percent energy savings for all customers. Based on these results, Central Lincoln plans to 
implement the CVR program system-wide. 
Customer Access to Web Portal: Customers can monitor and manage their energy usage through the 
web portal, which is accessible via home computer or mobile devices. Energy usage is presented by year, 
month, week, day, and 15-minute intervals and overlaid with daily temperature. Customers can 
compare their energy usage to others with similar home characteristics, challenge themselves to save 
energy, and receive alerts when they are using more electricity than usual.
