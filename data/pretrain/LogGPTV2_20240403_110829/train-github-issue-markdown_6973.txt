We seem to be having an issue with the validator service when using
collections and the validator to check for unique entities.
The validator will correctly find any issues before persisting the entity to
the doctrine manager.
The validator seems to check the data in the current database but doesn't
check the data that is going to be saved.
For instance if title is a unique entity and in my collection I am adding two
new collections to the database both with the title abc it will not throw an
error with the validator but will try to add them both causing an internal
server error.
We are adding clientside checks but wasn't sure if this was a bug in the
validator service.
