To effectively implement CIS Control 11.5, which focuses on testing data recovery, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Regular Testing**: Conduct backup recovery tests at least quarterly, or more frequently if necessary, to ensure the reliability and integrity of the recovery process.
2. **Sampling of Assets**: Select a representative sample of in-scope enterprise assets for each test. This ensures that the recovery process is validated across a diverse range of data and systems.
3. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document the results of each recovery test, including any issues encountered and the steps taken to resolve them. Use this information to continuously improve the recovery process.
4. **Review and Update Procedures**: Regularly review and update the data recovery procedures based on the test results and any changes in the organization's IT environment.

CIS Control 11.5 specifically addresses the asset type "Data" and falls under the security function "Recover." By following these procedures, organizations can enhance their ability to recover critical data in the event of a disruption or data loss.
