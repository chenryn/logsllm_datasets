which turn out to be the embedded web applications notorious
for vulnerabilities. 1.1M routers with web management pages
enabled on port 80 are accessible from arbitrary external IPv6
networks, which is identiﬁed by the login keywords along with
manual validation. 3.5M Jetty servers are approachable for the
whole Internet users to access their 8080 ports. Those devices
are mainly from China Mobile. Besides, the results show that
the security posture is worse on the HTTP services because the
web application is commonly deployed in every home router
and should not be accessed by arbitrary users through IPv6.
SSH. 138.6k devices show a serious version lagging on SSH
software, including dropbear (112k) with version 0.4x released
before 2006 and openssh 3.5 (469) released in 2002. 74 CVEs

could be used to exploit such devices for (i) DoS attacks, (ii)
code execution, and (iii) bypassing. Via brute-force password
attempts and privileges gaining vulnerability, the adversary can
conduct stealthy attacks, e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks.
FTP. 4 FTP software are running on the 176.6k FTP servers.
FreeBSD version 6.00ls and vsftpd are far away from updating,
bringing in 3 existing CVEs. The FTP service provides access
to fetch the router’s ﬁle system, potentially representing a back
door chance for adversaries to login using a default password.
TELNET. Among 179.7k TELNET servers, we recognize 37k
devices with forthright vendor banners (China Unicom, Yocto,
OpenWrt). Even though there is no software indicating CVEs,
the TELNET server itself is a threat for that the plain text and
weak passwords can be compromised to gain broader access.
NTP. For the NTP service, we just send a request to check its
visibility. All the exposed NTP servers (16k) are deployed with
NTP version 4 services, and 93% of the servers are located in
CenturyLink’s networks. Even if there is also no information to
imply related vulnerability, NTP can be and has been leveraged
for large-scale DDoS attacks with huge ampliﬁers [26], [75].
Those results show the service discrepancy observed among
