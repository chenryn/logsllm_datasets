User: I decided to tackle Python as a new language to learn. The first thing I want to do is code a script that will allow me to remotely restart services on other machines from my local machine. How would I accomplish this when the remote machine requires a username and password to log on? I don't need a full solution to be given to me but maybe some pointers on what libraries I should use or any issues I need to address when writing the script.
EDIT: All the remote machines are using Windows 2003
Assistant: Which OS for the target machines?  If 'service' is 'Windows NT service', and your local machine is also Windows, I'd use IronPython as the Python language implementation and call straight into the WMI facilities in the .net System.Management namespace -- they're meant for remote admin like that.
