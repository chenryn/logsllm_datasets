Use UTF-8 as source and executable encodings for C++ projects that  
contain UTF-8 source files.
Tree `35229a7` fails to build where the  
default code page is 936 (GBK), due to multiple files containing UTF-8  
encoded strings and/or comments, and these projects set to  
fail-on-warning mode. Additionally,  
src/host/ut_host/UnicodeLiteral.hpp contains a Windows-1252 encoded  
string. This commit adds the /utf-8 option to the affected projects,  
and converts src/host/ut_host/UnicodeLiteral.hpp to UTF-8.
