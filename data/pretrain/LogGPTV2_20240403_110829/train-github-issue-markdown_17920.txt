Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
DevTools extension does not persist state. For example, the “Welcome” dialog
displays upon every refresh.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**
  1. Open React DevTools in a React app.
  2. Change DevTools settings.
  3. Refresh app in browser.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Settings should be changed.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
This is in a corporate install of Chrome 71. It’s possible that it blocks
whichever persistence API React DevTools is using (Chrome DevTools itself
persists settings successfully).
