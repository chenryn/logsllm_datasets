In Windows 10, when Numpy has overflow it shows a wrong number without error.
In Linux it doesn't have this problem.
    import numpy as np
    a= [4, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 2, 8, 4, 8, 9]
    print (np.prod(a))
    >> -579076096
The correct one is
    import numpy as np
    a= [4, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 2, 8, 4, 8, 9]
    print (np.prod(a, dtype='int64'))
    >> 23514624000
Numpy should show some errors of overflow
