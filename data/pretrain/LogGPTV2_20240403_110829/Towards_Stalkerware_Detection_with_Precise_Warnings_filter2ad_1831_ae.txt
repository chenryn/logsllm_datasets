### Table 6: Top 25 Ranked Keywords for Stalkerware Detection Using Random Forest (RF)

Apps with keystroke logging functions often contain indicative keywords such as "keymonitor" and/or "keystrokes." These keywords are exclusively observed in the Keylogging type, making it straightforward to accurately attribute this surveillance type.

### 6.4 Importance Ranking of the Keywords

To deepen our understanding of the nuanced classification mechanism, we evaluate the informativeness of each textual feature dimension using a random forest classifier with the criterion of mean decrease impurity [11]. Each feature used in the RF-based detector is the TF-IDF value of a keyword. We rank the keywords based on their feature informativeness and provide the top-25 ranked keywords in Table 6. Additionally, we count the frequency of occurrence of each keyword in stalkerware and non-stalkerware apps to illustrate how the top-ranked keywords trigger detection.

In general, the top-ranked keywords are more indicative of the text-based descriptions of stalkerware than of non-stalkerware apps. For example, the following terms are exclusive to the titles and descriptions of stalkerware apps: keymonitor, whatweb, clone, biometrics, database restore, whatsmessage, phonefind, spyhuman, espiar, and stealer. The keyword "keymonitor" is the name of a popular stalkerware that appears multiple times in app stores under different identifiers, including ikeymonitor [4]. It stands out as one of the most fully-featured stalkerware apps, covering messages from Facebook Messenger, Line, Hangouts, Viber, WeChat, Kik, and Skype, if these applications are installed. It also enables access to call history logs, call recordings, calendar events, screen captures, audio recordings, contact lists, GPS locations, online browsing history, notes, pasteboard data, and keystrokes. Another prominent keyword is "spy," which frequently appears in the titles and descriptions of stalkerware, even as a substring in app titles such as mSpy and spyhuman. These apps conduct a broad spectrum of surveillance functions, including copying call logs, tracking app installation history, and copying text messages. This multi-label nature of stalkerware classification shows that a stalkerware app is usually equipped with multiple surveillance activities simultaneously. In contrast, other prominent keywords corresponding to app titles, such as whatsmessage, whatweb, and whatweb cloner, are for apps that spy on a single communication channel, like WhatsApp. Each of these apps allows an attacker to spy on an individual's WhatsApp account on another device. Noteworthy examples include the keywords clone, biometrics, phonefind, and stealer, each indicating a specific surveillance modality or style of privacy theft. Interestingly, some foreign language keywords, such as the Spanish word "espiar" (meaning "spy"), also appear in the list.

It is important to note that Dosmelt also detects apps that do not openly reference stalking functionality through words like "spying," based on keywords that skew towards stalkerware but appear in both stalkerware and non-stalkerware apps, such as dialing, chatting, gps, and message. For example, the dual-use app com.maha.orд.f indmylostphone was detected as having a stalkerware use case with a 0.946 probability, largely due to keywords like "automatically," "quick," and "stolen." Such words could appear in the description of a benign or malicious app, but taken together, they were correctly adjudged to be indicative of location-tracking functionality. In the appendix, we provide 19 concrete examples of detected stalkerware apps by Dosmelt, along with the identified surveillance capabilities, which were verified manually by human experts.

### 7. Discussion

We provide a brief discussion around the deployment plans of Dosmelt, its limitations, and pointers for future work.

**Impact:** Our experimental evaluation suggests that Dosmelt's mining of app titles and descriptions is a useful means of detecting stalkerware apps and identifying their surveillance capabilities. Although this method would be insufficient as a standalone approach, its ability to quickly detect new apps based on their advertised functionality complements existing static and dynamic analysis techniques [23, 33] and reputation systems [42]. Dosmelt is the first system to detect individual stalkerware surveillance capabilities. To help survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV), we submitted the manually labeled dataset we constructed, consisting of several hundred stalkerware apps not previously listed in the Coalition Against Stalkerware’s [18] Stalkerware Threat List, which now includes 246 apps directly detected by Dosmelt. The coalition’s threat list is used by several security vendors to protect their customers from stalkerware.

Dosmelt is notable because it enables the creation of precise stalkerware warnings based on app capabilities, as shown in Figure 1. While this represents a substantial leap forward, it only addresses one of several challenges in providing well-considered, usable stalkerware warnings. For instance, in IPV settings, the abuser typically installs the stalkerware app on the targeted individual's device [26]. Thus, an immediate warning by an installed security app could be counterproductive. The goal should be to warn all other users of the device except the person who installed the app, as this individual is already aware of the app’s functionality and may uninstall the security application once aware of its detection capabilities. Furthermore, the language used in the app itself should be carefully considered, as it is designed to be seen by IPV survivors, who may be suffering from post-traumatic stress [37] and other mental health complications due to ongoing abuse [29]. These notification-related challenges are important, but we leave them out of scope and plan to address them in future work.

**Limitations:** Dosmelt was designed to test the limits of an app’s self-description in detecting new stalkerware apps. While this method has clear advantages, it also has limitations. First, it works best for apps that have been hosted on the Google Play app store at least once. While we can extract descriptions from stalkerware that hosts its self-descriptions on its own website, automating this process for newly detected stalkerware is challenging. Additional complementary methods, such as dynamic analysis [23] and reputation-based systems [42], are needed. Dynamic analysis can identify some stalkerware capabilities but does not distinguish between stalkerware and non-stalking spyware.

A second limitation is the possibility of adversarial attacks. The most obvious attack against Dosmelt or a similar approach based on an app’s self-description would be to avoid stalkerware-related keywords. However, this approach is disadvantageous to the developer because those same keywords enable abusers to discover the app through internet and app store searches. Alternatively, a stalkerware developer might gain access to a list of keywords that Dosmelt associates with benign apps and inject these into the title or description to weaken the classifier’s confidence. While this is a feasible attack, a more adversarially-resistant version of Dosmelt could be based on recent work in adversarially robust decision trees [13, 16] to form a resilient random forest model. We intend to explore these directions in future work, though we recommend Dosmelt as a complement to existing techniques like dynamic tracking of sensitive information flow within the app [20, 24, 59] and not as a standalone solution.

Finally, we evaluated Dosmelt only on apps with titles and descriptions in English, as our training data was English-centric. There is a clear need to extend stalkerware detection methods to non-English apps, which we will address in future work.

### 8. Conclusion

Stalkerware is a global phenomenon with significant security and privacy implications for an increasing number of individuals. Existing work has not attempted to automatically identify the varied surveillance capabilities of stalkerware apps, leading to confusing stalkerware notifications, particularly for apps with legitimate benign uses. Performing this task at scale is challenging due to the lack of large datasets of stalkerware with labeled individual surveillance features. To address this, we developed Dosmelt, a multi-label stalkerware detection system that identifies the various types of surveillance conducted by each app. Our method leverages an active learning methodology to promote effective learning with a modest set of hand-annotated apps. We conducted an extensive evaluation of Dosmelt to demonstrate its effectiveness and submitted our manually labeled dataset of stalkerware apps and those detected by Dosmelt to the Coalition Against Stalkerware’s Stalkerware Threat List, to which interested researchers can apply for access.
