The log entry you provided follows this pattern: "Reading broadcast variable [variable number] took [time in milliseconds] ms."

To generalize, the pattern can be expressed as:
"Reading broadcast variable <*> took <*> ms"

Where:
- `<*>` is a placeholder for the specific values (e.g., `9` for the variable number and `160` for the time in milliseconds).

So, the pattern from which the log was derived is:
"Reading broadcast variable [variable number] took [time in milliseconds] ms."
