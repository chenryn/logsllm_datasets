Theorem 2. The threshold ring signature scheme is anony-
mous against full key exposure if the subgroup hiding as-
sumption holds.
Proof. Setup. The simulator B is given the subgroup
decision problem instance (N, G, GT , ^e, g, h). B is asked to
determine whether h ∈ G or h ∈ Gq. B randomly picks the
generators u, u1, . . . uk, B0 ∈ G and α ∈ ZN . B sets
h2 = h(cid:11).
Finally, B randomly chooses a collision resistant hash func-
tion H : N×G∗×{0, 1}∗ → {0, 1}k. Then B gives the public
parameters
g2 = g(cid:11)
1 ,
h1 = h,
g1 = g,
(N, G, GT , ^e, g1, g2, B0, h1, h2, u, u1, . . . , uk, H)

For i = 1, . . . , n, B picks random si ∈ ZN and sets:
pki = gsi

ski = gsi
2 .

Oracle Simulation. B simulates the oracles as follows:
i=1.
• J O: on the i-th query, B returns pki.
• CO(pki): B returns gsi

4.2.1 Insider Security for Anonymity
From the above security proof of anonymity, we can see
that the adversary cannot win the game even if it is given
all user secret keys (which is known as the full key exposure
attack [5]). According to the security model, the challenge
signature σ
is solely generated by the simulator and the
adversary does not obtain any internal information during
the generation of σ
∗
∗
.
. There-
However, our security model does not consider the insider
security during the generation of threshold ring signatures.
The adversary may use the information transferred between
di(cid:11)erent signers to break the anonymity. In our construc-
tion, S1;i and S2;i are sent from user i to a central signer
who runs step 1 and step 3 of the Sign algorithm. If any S1;i
and S2;i is eavesdropped, or the (malicious) central signer
releases the S1;i and S2;i, then the anonymity of user i is
lost. Therefore, our current security model for anonymity
assumes that the communication channel between signers
are secure, and all signers are trusted during the generation
of the threshold ring signatures. However, our anonymity
model still captures the case that a signer loses his secret
∗
key to the adversary before or after the generation of σ
.
We just do not allow the adversary to actively participate
in the generation of the threshold ring signature.

4.3 Efﬁciency Analysis
When comparing our scheme with the 1-out-of-n SW ring
signature scheme, the size of our signature is exactly the
same as the SW scheme.
In terms of computation cost,
the overall signing process only increases by some elliptic
curve addition operations. However, if it is measured as per
signer computation, each signer actually requires less, when
compared to the SW scheme. The veri(cid:12)cation algorithm
only requires 1 more exponentiation to the SW scheme.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented an e(cid:14)cient construction of
threshold ring signature without random oracles. Our scheme
is a non-trivial extension of the Shacham-Waters (SW) sig-
nature [26]. Interestingly, we obtained the same signature
size as the Shacham-Waters signature, while only a tiny com-
putation cost is added. We note that our technique has been
speci(cid:12)cally customized to achieve a threshold ring signature
in the standard model.
