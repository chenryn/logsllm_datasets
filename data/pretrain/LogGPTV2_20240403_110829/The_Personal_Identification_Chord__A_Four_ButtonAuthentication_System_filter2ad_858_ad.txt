Recall times for all sessions are presented in Table 5 while re-
call attempts are in Table 6. Recall preparation times were not
significant while recall entry times for the shown condition in
both first and second tests showed significant main effects with a
2(3) = 19.99, p
Kruskal-Wallis test (χ
< 0.001, respectively). Corrected post-hoc tests indicated that the
PIN-original policy led to reduced recall entry times compared
to all other policies on both days (all p < 0.05 or lower). A similar
analysis of recall attempts showed significant main effects in first
2(3) =
recall-hidden (χ
9.37, p = 0.025) tests. Corrected post-hoc tests showed a single signif-
icant difference: in the first recall-hidden test, the PIC-dual-rand
policy required significantly fewer attempts to authenticate than
the PIN-original policy (χ
2(3) = 12.66, p = 0.005) and second recall (χ
2(1) = 7.78, p = 0.03).
5.2.5 External storage usage. After completing each recall test,
we asked the participants about the use of an external storage (see
Q1 in Table 2). Just three participants reported using an external
storage, noting down their PINs or PICs after the first session. We
ensured that no one cheated during all recall tests though.
5.2.6
Input difficulty. Based on the participants’ responses to
Q2 in Table 2, we estimated PIN/PIC “input difficulty” across four
different policies. Responses collected after day 2 recall-hidden
session indicate that PIC-dual and PIC-free may be easier to
enter than PINs when GUIs are hidden - see Figure 5.

across the four policies (µ: mean, σ: standard deviation).

Table 8: The number of PINs and PICs that contain a tap used
twice or more across the four policies. “X” represents a tap
or item that is used more than twice in a given PIC/PIN, and
“?” represents any tap or item. “Any” represents the total
number PINs or PICs that contain an “X” without recount-
ing PINs/PICs that belong to multiple “X” patterns.
