There are at least three sets of URLs that give the same thing:
http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/  
http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/  
http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/
One of the should be picked and the others redirect to it.
Related, but I believe not quite duplicate: #9461, #12466, #14466, #18558.
