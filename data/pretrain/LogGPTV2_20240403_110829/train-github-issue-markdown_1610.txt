There are at least three URLs that provide the same content:
- http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/
- http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/
- http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/

To avoid confusion, one of these URLs should be designated as the primary source, and the other two should be set to redirect to it.

Related issues, though not exact duplicates, include: #9461, #12466, #14466, and #18558.
