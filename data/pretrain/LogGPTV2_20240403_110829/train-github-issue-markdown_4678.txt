### Steps to reproduce:
Numpy compiled with GCC on same system works fine (no error in Inkscape).  
Steps to reproduce:
  * additional flags: `-O3 -pipe -march=skylake -mtune=skylake -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 -gsplit-dwarf -flto=thin`
  * LDFLAGS: `-fuse-ld=lld -rtlib=compiler-rt -unwindlib=libunwind -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,--compress-debug-sections=zlib -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now -Wl,--undefined-version -Wl,--plugin-opt=dwo_dir= -Wl,--threads=4`
  * Compile numpy-1.24.2 with clang-16.0.2/17.0.0_pre20230421 and `-stdlib=libc++`.
  * When trying to save an optimized svg with media-gfx/inkscape-1.2.2, I get the following error message:

    IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!
    Importing the numpy C-extensions failed. This error can happen for
    many reasons, often due to issues with your setup or how NumPy was
    installed.
    We have compiled some common reasons and troubleshooting tips at:
        https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html
    Please note and check the following:
      * The Python version is: Python3.11 from "/usr/lib/python-exec/python3.11/python3"
      * The NumPy version is: "1.24.2"
    and make sure that they are the versions you expect.
    Please carefully study the documentation linked above for further help.
