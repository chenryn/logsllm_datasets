## Steps to Reproduce
I have a project when I try to run a drive test, I get
      [drive-test]
        flutter drive -t test_driver/all.dart
        Using device Pixel XL.
        Starting application: test_driver/all.dart
        Initializing gradle...
        Resolving dependencies...
        Installing build/app/outputs/apk/app.apk...
        Running 'gradlew assembleDebug'...
        FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
        * What went wrong:
        Execution failed for task ':app:transformClassesWithJarMergingForDebug'.
        > com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: java.util.zip.ZipException: duplicate entry: com/google/android/gms/common/internal/zzq.class
        * Try:
        Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
        Gradle build failed: 1
      failed with exit code 1
I haven't found a `--stacktrace` option.
Perhaps
       --[no-]trace-startup        Start tracing during startup.
from `flutter drive -h` is meant?
## Logs
Run your application with `flutter run` and attach all the log output.
Run `flutter analyze` and attach any output of that command also.
