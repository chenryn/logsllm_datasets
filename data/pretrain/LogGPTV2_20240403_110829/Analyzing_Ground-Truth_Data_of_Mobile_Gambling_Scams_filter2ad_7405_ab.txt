scam activities happened in China. We summarize the high-
level statistics of our dataset in Table I. Among them, 456 scam
apps have been taken down, while others remain active at the
time of submission due to investigative interest by Anonymous
Authority.
For each online gambling scam app we investigate, we have
some or all of the following information, which we analyze
in more detail in Section V and VI, as elaborated below.
• Scam app samples. This dataset consists of 1,487 online
gambling scam app samples (1,068 Android samples and 419
iOS samples). The ﬁle size of samples ranges from 23 KB
to 93.9MB. The smallest one only contains ﬁve Java classes
and implements most of its functions via WebView [12].
Meanwhile, the largest one consists of multiple SDKs (e.g.,
push service SDK,
third-party payment SDK) to support
various functionalities. As an instance, we observe that one
scam app integrates a live show SDK for gambling activity
live streaming to lure victims.
• Scam incident reports. The scam incident reports consist
of detailed information of the mobile gambling scam incident
from victims, including the time of the incident, amount of
loss, and incident summary (including how scammers establish
a connection with victims, how scammers build and earn the
trust of victims, and how scammers deliver scam apps to
victims, etc.). The length of incident summaries ranges from
171 words to 1,931 words, with an average of 606.66 words
and an standard deviation of 190.36 words.
IV. ETHICS
Our data is similar to that used in prior cybercrime stud-
ies [13], [14], [15]. It originates from law enforcement proce-
dures to seize and record scam activities. Employing such data
might raise ethical issues. Therefore, we carefully manage our
research activities to ensure they stay within legal and ethical
boundaries.
This research has been approved by our institution’s IRB.
The approval process is similar to the exempt review in the
U.S. because this study is considered as “minimal risk” when
we consulted with the IRB staffs. Note that our research only
uses the previously collected data (collected by collaborated
Anonymous Authority), and any possible Personal Identiﬁable
Information (PII) in scam incident reports was removed before
the reports were shared with us.
Apart from acquiring the approval of our institutions, we
also comply with the principles identiﬁed in the Menlo
Report [16]. More speciﬁcally,
to evaluate “balancing the
risks and beneﬁts” based on the Menlo Report, we carefully
designed our experiment and ensured that our research did not
contribute any ﬁnancial proﬁts to the criminal. For example,
our deposit testing (Section VII) neither sent any money to
beneﬁt the criminals nor attempted to communicate with scam-
mers. In our research, we repeatedly placed deposit requests
and then withdrew those requests after collecting transaction
information (e.g., cryptocurrency addresses). Over the course
of this paper, we did not interact with either the victims or the
scammers.
In addition, this research aims to proﬁle mobile gambling
scam activities to the research community, enable law en-
forcement and policymakers to better understand and provide
insight into these new types of scam activities. We are sure that
the beneﬁts to the general public far exceed any knowledge
that the criminals might obtain from the high-level details
presented in our paper.
V. ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING TRICKS
To investigate social engineering attacks [17] used in mobile
gambling scams, we conduct a qualitative study of scam
incident reports. Each report is associated with an independent
victim. 1 Their ages range from 14 to 79 (2.1% of ≤20, 70.6%
of 21-40, 22.9% of 41-56, 4.4% of ≥57), and their education
levels vary from elementary school to doctoral degree (2.8%
of elementary school, 21.5% of middle school, 23.3% of high
school, 52.4% of college). In particular, this study seeks to
answer the following research questions:
RQ1 How does a scammer establish connections with a
victim to build trust?
RQ2 How does a scammer deliver a scam app to a victim?
RQ3 How does a scammer lure victims to deposit money
continually?
RQ4 What is the logic of mobile gambling scams?
A. Data Coding
We used the qualitative open-coding technique [18] on 1,461
scam incident reports to study the aforementioned questions.
Speciﬁcally,
two cybersecurity professionals independently
reviewed a random set of 75 incident reports (about 5% of
the total) and resolved inconsistencies while generating initial
codebooks. They then independently coded the remaining
1,311 reports and compared their coded results by Krippen-
dorff’s alpha coefﬁcient, a widely used statistical measure of
the agreement achieved when coding a set of units of analysis.
Krippendorff’s alpha of this study is 0.85, higher than the
reliability threshold in social science [19]. Afterwards, they
resolved all disagreements in coding phrases for each incident
to generate the ﬁnal codes. The ultimate codebook developed
provides labels for the footprints of a scammer exploiting
human psychology to establish a connection, deliver an app,
and lure a victim to deposit money continually. Table II shows
the codebook. In total, it took two human laborers around
two weeks to complete the procedure. It is worth noting that
the coding book has a limited coverage due to the vantage
point of our study. Some incident reports do not mention the
corresponding social engineering tricks.

B. Connection Establishment
Firstly, we analyze how a scammer bootstraps the attack by
establishing a connection with the victim, coded as Connection
Establishment, as shown in Table II. We code a strategy
as Role Play when a scammer plays a role to establish a
connection and build trust. For instance, ID-1380 described
how a scammer built a connection with him:
“ I published the house renting information on a local
information sharing forum, and then a man contacted me
to ask if the house was rented out. I replied that the house
had not been rented. After that, he told me his business
focused on furniture trading and frequently chatted with
me. I put down my guard gradually. Until someday, he
recommended me a gambling app... ”
Further, the roles played by scammers are organized into
three main methods based on our codebook: Professional,
Intimate relationship and Authority. When coding as Profes-
sional (22.7%), scammers act as the technical staff or gam-
bling tutor who can hack into the gambling system or master
gambling secrets to help victims proﬁt. The code of Intimate
relationship (14.0%) describes that scammers establish roman-
tic or close relationships with victims (e.g., boy/girl friend) to
build trust. Apart from that, the code Authority (0.7%) means
that the scammer chooses a role with a higher social status and
prestige, e.g., law enforcement ofﬁcers, to contact victims.
As shown in Table III,
in our study, we observe that
scammers seek victims on online social networks (OSN), such
as online Q&A, short-video sharing, job-hunting, and dating
platforms, and then set up role play based on the information
a victim left on the OSN. This approach is different from
traditional scams [25], [26], which usually make telephone
calls or send emails to establish connections. Scammers also
tend to set up role-play with higher social statuses, profes-
sional techniques, or intimate relationships when establishing
connections with victims. For instance, ID-627 trusted the
scammer because the scammer showed his “professional” in
information technology:
“ He (the scammer) is the leader of a software company.
One day, he told me that the system of XX[anonymized]
has a vulnerability, and he was leading a technical team
to solve that issue. Two days later, he said that while ﬁxing

42179
the issue, he found a vulnerability of a gambling app that
can be exploited to earn money... ”
We also observe many cases (14.0%) where scammers strike
up a relationship with victims to build their trust before
delivering gambling apps. For example, as ID-844 described:
as winning bonuses. Meanwhile, 11.0% of scammers put
psychological pressure on the victims if they do not make
deposits, coded as “Pressure” strategy. For instance, ID-544
depicted that s/he was blamed for providing an incorrect
payback bank card number:
“ I happily chatted with him (the scammer), and soon he
became my boyfriend. He informed me that there was a
quick way to make money in mid-May... ”
“ ...the customer service said that my bank card number
was incorrect...Only with one more deposit could I change
the card number. ”
Finding I: Scammers tend to palm themselves off as hold-
ing roles with high social statuses, professional techniques,
or intimate relationships when establishing connections
with victims.
Finding II: Scammers prefer to seek victims and establish
connections via online social networks (OSN) (e.g., online
Q&A, job-hunting).
C. App Delivery
A critical step in gambling scam activities is delivering apps
to victims. To achieve this goal, scammers leverage several
psychological strategies, as shown in Table II. We code a
strategy as Scammer Driven (56.7%) when scammers persuade
the victims to download gambling apps. The code of Victim
