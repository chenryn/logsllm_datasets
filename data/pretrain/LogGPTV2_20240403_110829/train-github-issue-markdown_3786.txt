When creating a form type class with a default validation_group (using
validation_groups key in default options array), I found that the specified
group is not taken into account when generating the form for the NotBlank
assert annotation (and most liekly the NotNull one as well).
When adding a NotBlank assert annotations to a model (or entity) class with a
group application filter (groups attribute for the annotation) and generating
a form view for this class (via a form type specifying the default validation
group or another validation group), the Not Blank annotation is always
processed before rendering the form and the field always ends up with a
require="required" attribute.
The validation_groups options of the form type class should always be taken
into account when generating a form. Right now it is not correctly processed
and the generated form does not match the expected result ; the only way I
found to fix this behaviour without going into the symfony core classes was to
render each field using an attribute "required" => false when rendering the
field using the form_(row|widget) twig tag.
