When creating a form type class with a default `validation_groups` (using the `validation_groups` key in the default options array), I noticed that the specified group is not considered when generating the form for the `@Assert\NotBlank` annotation (and likely the `@Assert\NotNull` one as well).

If you add a `@Assert\NotBlank` annotation to a model (or entity) class and specify a validation group (using the `groups` attribute of the annotation), and then generate a form view for this class (via a form type that specifies the default validation group or another validation group), the `@Assert\NotBlank` annotation is always processed before rendering the form. As a result, the field ends up with a `required="required"` attribute, regardless of the specified validation group.

The `validation_groups` option of the form type class should be respected during form generation. Currently, it is not being correctly processed, leading to a form that does not match the expected result. The only workaround I found, without modifying Symfony's core classes, is to render each field with the `required` attribute set to `false` using the `form_row` or `form_widget` Twig tags.

### Summary:
- **Issue**: The `validation_groups` option in the form type class is not honored when generating the form.
- **Symptom**: Fields annotated with `@Assert\NotBlank` (and possibly `@Assert\NotNull`) are always marked as required, even if they should not be based on the specified validation group.
- **Workaround**: Set the `required` attribute to `false` when rendering fields in the Twig template.

This behavior should be addressed to ensure that the form generation respects the specified validation groups.
