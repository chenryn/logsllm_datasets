User: I'm using python and anaconda to work on some code, which turns out to requires wx2.8, but all I can find is installer for wx3.0.  
I looked into it, and the process for building an older version of wx from source is very unclear.  It's not as simple as python setup.py install for example.  Does anyone have experience with this, or at least can provides some reading on the matter that they know for a fact works?  I'm also not using my system python, so I can't do sudo apt-get install (unless you can specify the python installation path in such a way).
Assistant: Run this:
sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-wxtools wx2.8-i18n
