### Server for Us

#### Scripted Web Delivery
This attack generates a payload and provides a one-liner command to execute code on a system using PowerShell, BITSAdmin, Python, or other scripting languages.

#### Signed Applet Attack
This package sets up a self-signed Java applet. If the user grants permission for the applet to run, it will spawn the specified listener.

#### Smart Applet Attack
The smart applet detects the Java version and uses an embedded exploit to disable the Java security sandbox. This attack is cross-platform and cross-browser.

#### System Profiler
The system profiler is a client-side reconnaissance tool that identifies common applications (with version numbers) used by the user and reports them back to the attacker.

### Spear Phishing
This option can be used to launch targeted attacks during red team activities. You can set the receivers, phishing templates, and SMTP servers, and then click "Send" to perform the attack.

### Example: Payload Generation and Execution
Let's look at an example of payload generation and execution using the Payload Generator. Go to **Attack**, click on **Packages**, and then select **Payload Generator** as shown in the following screenshot:

![](media/image600.jpeg)

A new window will open where you need to choose the listener and the output format of the payload. Select **PowerShell Command** and click **Generate**:

![](media/image601.jpeg)

A new window will ask you to choose the output folder, and the payload will be generated and copied into a `.txt` file. Opening the `.txt` file will reveal a base64 encoded PowerShell command, as shown below:

Executing this code will establish a connection to your server, as illustrated in the following screenshot:

### Beacons
Beacons are flexible payloads used by Cobalt Strike, supporting both asynchronous and interactive modes of communication. In asynchronous mode, the beacon periodically calls home, receives tasks, downloads them, and goes back to sleep. This helps avoid detection on the remote system. In interactive mode, everything happens in real time. Beacons have malleable network indicators, which means they use a **Malleable C2** profile for data transport and transformation.

Cobalt Strike offers two ways to access beacons:
- The beacon menu
- The beacon console

#### The Beacon Menu
The beacon menu can be accessed by right-clicking on the host. The Access menu contains the following options:

![](media/image604.jpeg)

- **Dump Hashes**: Runs the `hashdump` command on the beacon, which dumps the system's NT LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes. It requires elevated privileges.
  ![](media/image605.jpeg)

- **Elevate**: Uses built-in exploits for privilege escalation to gain admin rights. Choose **Access | Elevate** from the menu, as shown below:
  ![](media/image606.jpeg)
  Clicking on this option opens a new window where you can choose an existing listener or create a new one and select the exploit to run:
  ![](media/image607.jpeg)
  Once you click **Launch**, the exploit will be executed, as shown in the console:
  ![](media/image608.jpeg)
  If successful, a new elevated session will be created:
  ![](media/image609.jpeg)

- **Golden Ticket**: This option has multiple dependencies and may not always work. It requires the user, domain name, domain's security identifier (SID), and the NTLM hash of the Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (KRBTGT) user on a Domain Controller (DC). If available, the Golden Ticket option generates a golden ticket and injects it into the current session to gain elevated privileges.

- **Make Token**: Allows passing credentials to Cobalt Strike, which will generate a token.

- **Run Mimikatz**: Integrates Mimikatz with the Cobalt Strike beacon, allowing the use of Mimikatz features. Right-click on the host and select **Access | Run Mimikatz**:
  ![](media/image610.jpeg)
  This will dump the hashes, as shown below:
  ![](media/image611.jpeg)
  ![](media/image612.jpeg)
  View the dumped credentials by going to the **View** menu and choosing **Credentials**:
  ![](media/image613.jpeg)

- **Spawn As**: Use this to launch another beacon as a different user on the system after gaining their credentials. Right-click on the host and select **Access | Spawn As**:
  ![](media/image614.jpeg)
  A new window will open where you can choose the user and the listener, and then click **Launch**:
  ![](media/image615.jpeg)
  ![](media/image616.jpeg)

#### Explore Menu
The Explore menu includes the following options:

- **Browser Pivot**: Performs a man-in-the-browser attack to hijack a victim's authenticated browser session. Set up a proxy server that injects into Internet Explorer. Right-click on the host and go to **Explore | Browser Pivot**:
  ![](media/image617.jpeg)
  Choose the process and port number, and click **Launch** to start the proxy server. Open your local browser and set the IP and port of the team server as a proxy to view the authenticated sessions:
  ![](media/image618.jpeg)
  ![](media/image619.jpeg)

- **Desktop (VNC)**: Allows viewing the desktop of the machine through VNC. Right-click on the host and select **Explore | Desktop (VNC)**:
  ![](media/image620.jpeg)
  ![](media/image621.jpeg)
  The beacon injects the VNC server into the victim's process and port-forwards it to the team server's IP. Connect to the IP and port of the team server through any VNC client to view the desktop.

- **File Browser**: Browse the files and folders on the victim's machine through a GUI. Right-click on the host and select **Explore | File Browser**:
  ![](media/image622.jpeg)
  ![](media/image623.jpeg)

- **Port Scan**: Scans the internal network of the victim's machine. Right-click on the host and go to **Explore | Port Scan**:
  ![](media/image624.jpeg)
  A new window will show the internal IP and netmask of the victim. Choose the IP, specify the ports, and select the type of scan. For example, an ARP scan to discover online hosts:
  ![](media/image625.jpeg)
  ![](media/image626.jpeg)
  Click **Scan** to see a list of reachable hosts in the network.

- **Process List**: Shows a list of all running processes on the system. Right-click on the host and select **Explore | Process List**:
  ![](media/image627.jpeg)
  Inject the beacon into another process, log keystrokes, take screenshots, and more:
  ![](media/image628.png)

#### Beacon Console
The beacon menu does not show all available features, but the beacon console allows full utilization. Open the console by right-clicking on a host and selecting **Interact**:
![](media/image629.jpeg)
Set the sleep time of the beacon to zero to switch to interactive mode:
```
sleep 0
```
To view a complete list of commands, type `help`:

Some commonly used commands include:
- **pwd**: Prints the current working directory.
- **hashdump**: Dumps password hashes from the system.
- **shell**: Executes a command passed as a parameter in the system's shell and prints the output.
