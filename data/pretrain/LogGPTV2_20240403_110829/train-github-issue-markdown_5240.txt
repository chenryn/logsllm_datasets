 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
feature
**What is the current behavior?**
There is no way to define a custom mode.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
**What is the expected behavior?**
I'm making this up -
`--mode npm://package-name`
Why?
  * I still want source maps so I can debug in production. I thought this is what people are doing?
  * I want to share this config with friends
  * I want a hash in the filename right?
  * As webpack maintainers, you want to know the most popular configs... you can track these back now
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version, and Operating System.**
