Question: In the context of block cipher modes of operation, why might an attacker target the padding of an encrypted message using a bit-flipping attack, and what is one possible outcome if the underlying encryption mode is Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)?
"A": "The attacker aims to cause an integrity breach, resulting in the garbling of the plaintext corresponding to the manipulated cipher block.",
"B": "The attacker seeks to exhaust system resources, leading to a denial of service by triggering infinite loop decryption processes.",
"C": "The attacker's goal is to bypass input validation checks, allowing execution of unauthorized commands on the system.",
"D": "The attacker aims to intercept and modify SSL/TLS certificates, undermining the security of the communication channel."
Answer: A
