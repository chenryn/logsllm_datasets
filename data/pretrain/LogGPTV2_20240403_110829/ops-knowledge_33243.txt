The official website provides instructions for installing the Weka wrapper on Ubuntu 64-bit. However, I would like to know how to install it on Ubuntu 32-bit.

Before installing the Weka wrapper for Python, you need to first install Weka itself. You can do this using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install weka
```
Alternatively, you can build Weka from the source code. After installing Weka, you should add its path to the environment variable by running:
```bash
export WEKAHOME="your_weka_path"
```
This ensures that the required Weka JAR file is in the correct directory.
