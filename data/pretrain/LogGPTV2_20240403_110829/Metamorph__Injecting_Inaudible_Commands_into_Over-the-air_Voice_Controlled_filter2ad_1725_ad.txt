attack distance to 7 m and 8 m (long-range), Meta-Init rarely
succeeds, with a CSR of only around 20%.
In contrast, since the enhanced version Meta-Enha lever-
ages the domain discriminator to minimize the channel effect,
we can see its CSR remains in a constantly high level (around
100%) over both short and middle range link settings. CSR
performance then drops to around 80% in long link distance
settings. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our
domain discriminator-based “cleaning” design.
The CSR performance of the audio quality improved ver-
sion Meta-Qual is higher than the initial method and lower
than the enhanced one. Its CSR value is constantly high when
the link is shorter than 3 m.
As we expand the link distance further, the CSR perfor-
mance of Meta-Qual drops, yet it is still higher than that of

the initial method. The CSR drop is mainly due to the reduced
perturbation coverage (§III-C). The resulting perturbation in
Meta-Qual becomes sparse and concentrates on modifying
only a part of the original audio I, which actually trades off the
performance of success rate and reliability for audio quality.
TSR performance. we further calculate the transcript success
rate (TSR) for each attack method and plot
in
Figure 13(b). TSR shares a similar trend with CSR yet with
different success rate details. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the
adversarial transcripts are all successfully interpreted when the
attacker loudspeaker is within the short range of the victim
microphone. As we expand the link distance to 2 m, TSR
of Meta-Init drops to around 60%. The initial method never
succeeds as we expand the link distance further.
the result
In contrast, the enhanced method never fails within the 5 m
attacking range. As we expand the attacking range to 6 m and
further to 8 m, TSR of the enhanced method drops to 90% and
then 50%. The Meta-Qual method, on the other hand, succeeds
over 90% within the 3 m attacking range, which is better than
the initial method. TSR of Meta-Qual then drops to 50% and
then 5% as we expand the attacking range to 5 m and further
to 8 m.
2) NLOS Attack: We next evaluate the performance of
Metamorph in the NLOS conditions. Launching adversarial
attack in the NLOS environment is more challenging as the
blocking materials not only attenuates the acoustic signals but
also introduce frequency selectivity due to the non-uniform
distribution of blocking materials. In this experiment we launch
attacks with the adversarial examples trained by Meta-Enha
and Meta-Qual. Figure 14(a-b) shows CSR and TSR of Meta-
Enha across different
locations. To imitate the real attack
where the attacker is unaware of the exact location of the
victim device, we place the attacker speaker facing towards
the blockage (e.g., the wall or the wooden splitter) across all
testing locations. The victim microphone, on the other hand, is
facing towards the wall on the left throughout the experiment.
When we move speaker in the room, the facing direction
(angle) between two devices varies from about 45◦ to 135◦.
Figure 14 shows that Metamorph achieves consistently high
CSR across the majority of attacking locations. CSR drops to
46% at the corner of this ofﬁce building, primarily due to the
severe multi-path introduced by walls, tables, and monitors
nearby. TSR also shows a similar trend with different success
rate details. We observe Meta-Enha achieves over 85% TSR
across 11/20 NLOS attacking locations. In particular, we ﬁnd
that attacker could initiate the attack with a consistently high
TSR in the corridor. This result demonstrates the efﬁciency
of our domain adaptation algorithm and practicality of our
adversarial attack. As the victim microphone is facing towards
the wall on the left throughout the experiment, the performance
is generally better when the speaker is placed to the left-hand
side of the room. Moreover, we observe both CSR and TSR
are relatively low of Meta-Qual in Figure 15(a-b) and suggest
to launch Meta-Enha in NLOS attacks.
3) Audio Quality: In this experiment we quantify the audio
quality of adversarial examples generated by different methods
using the MCD metric (introduced in §IV-A). A lower MCD
value indicates a higher similarity between the adversarial
example and the original audio. We ﬁnd Metamorph has
different audio quality behaviors with the music (M) and
human speech (S) as audio source. Hence, we plot the MCDs
of Meta-Enha and Meta-Qual separately to achieve a more
comprehensive view.
Figure 16: MCD values achieved by different methods (with
a reversed y-axis representation).
MCD comparison. Figure 16 shows MCD comparison result,
wherein we also plot the MCD of the adversarial example
generated by Carlini et al. [2] as a reference (REF). From the
ﬁgure, we can see that REF achieves the lowest MCD value
(15.5) on average, followed by Meta-Qual(M) (18), Meta-
Enha(M) (22.5), Meta-Qual(S) (24.2), Meta-Enha(S) (27.9),
and Meta-Init (27). Meta-Enha(S) achieves the highest MCD
(27.9). Meta-Qual achieves lower MCDs (better audio quality)
than Meta-Enha for each type of the audio ﬁles, indicating that
our proposed mechanisms in §III-C improve the audio quality
successfully. On the other hand, the adversarial examples gen-
erated from musics outperform those generated from speeches
in general, because music ﬁles usually have a higher power
than the speech ﬁles, while their added perturbations have
similar amplitude levels. Therefore, music-based adversarial
examples could have a higher SNR to achieve a lower MCD.
User perceptibility study. While the above objective MCD
measurement justiﬁes the similarity between the adversarial
example and the original source audio, these MCD values
fail to reﬂect the subjective opinions from human beings, e.g.,

whether the adversarial examples can be easily perceived by
humans. We thus invite 50 volunteers (20 females and 30
males) with diverse ages ranging from 18 to 50 and conduct a
perceptibility evaluation of the audio quality. These volunteers
are non-paid for this study and have no hearing disease. We
utilize the adversarial examples listed in Table 5 (Appendix) to
conduct the following two trials of user perceptibility studies.5
a) In the ﬁrst trial, volunteers will sequentially listen to
each set of audios organized as follows: “[(one original audio,
the adversarial example generated from this audio by Meta-
Enha), 60s pause, (the same original audio, the adversar-
ial example generated from this audio by Meta-Qual), 60s
pause]”. In each 60s pause, volunteers assess the audio quality
of the adversarial example (they just heard) compared with the
original audio by answering the following four questions.
Volunteers ﬁrst select whether this adversarial example has
a same audio quality as the original audio, including both the
noise level and the audio content. If the answer is Yes (i.e.,
no difference), the assessment of this adversarial example is
complete for the ﬁrst trial; Otherwise, volunteers will further
answer the following questions for this adversarial example.
• Word change (Yes or No): any word (content) change is
• Audio quality level: we have provided four options (1–4)
reﬂecting different audio quality levels for volunteers to rate.
• Description: we have also provided two options (A and B)
to describe how or where, the volunteers think, such noises
come from. If none of them ﬁts, they can also select “C
(Others)” and describe using their own words.
perceived compared to the original audio’s transcript?
Due to the page limit, the explanations of above three questions
and the options are detailed in Table 4 (Appendix). Table 1
summarizes the results. Although nearly 90% adversarial ex-
amples are thought not exactly the same as their original
audios, among those examples, 98.1% to 99.5% of them do
not cause the hearing of any content (word) change to the
volunteers, i.e., the heard content is still the original transcript.
In terms of the audio quality level, 64.7% of the adversarial
examples from Meta-Enha(S) are rated to be slightly loud
(level 2), and even 20% of them cause the missed hearing
of certain audio content occasionally due to noise. However,
around 47.2% to 55.0% adversarial examples are rated to be
clear (level 1) for Meta-Enha(M), as well as for both Meta-
Qual(M) and (S), implying the effectiveness of our Meta-Qual
design on improving the audio quality. In the description ﬁeld,
for 88.1% to 91.3% of the adversarial examples, volunteers feel
that the noises are coming from the hardware (e.g., recording

of them, they feel that it is due to the low-quality of audio
clip itself (Option B). For the rest 3%, volunteers describe
like “mixture of options A and B”, “sound dithering from the
old tape recorder”, “buzzing effect”, etc.
b) After a 10-minute rest, volunteers start the second trial.
At the beginning of this trial, we play original audios one more
time to refresh the volunteers’ impressions on the audio quality
of these original audios. Then we play audio clips (either an
original audio or an adversarial example) in a random order,
and volunteers are not aware they are about to hear an original
audio or an adversarial one each time. After hearing each
played audio, volunteers need to decide whether this played
audio is an original audio clip immediately.

TABLE 2: Results from the second trial of the user study.
Table 2 summarizes the result. We can see with this exper-
imental setting, even about 10% original audios are recognized
incorrectly. For M-Enha(S), a small portion of adversarial
examples are recognized as the original audios, while the music
audios can increase this ratio to 36.7%. With our audio quality
improvement design, M-Qual(M) and M-Qual(S) can further
improve the ratio to 42.4% and 39.4%, respectively.
Conclusion. According to this ﬁeld study, we conclude that
within a moderate attack distance (e.g., 3 m), Meta-Qual can
be ﬁrstly considered. For the long links, Meta-Enha(M) is
prioritized than Meta-Enha(S), if the music source can be
selected in the attack.

(with a reversed y-axis representation for MCD).
C. Micro-Benchmarks
We next conduct micro-benchmarks to understand the
effect of each designing factors on Metamorph’s performance.
Suggested by the ﬁeld study, Meta-Enha and Meta-Qual can
achieve effective attacking results (e.g., abover 90% TSRs) at
distances of ﬁve and three meters, respectively. We thus adopt
these link distances in the micro-benchmarks.

1) Effect of Transcript Length: Given a source audio,
the audio quality degrades with the growth of adversarial
transcripts that being inserted in this audio source. In this
experiment, we deﬁne a new metric frame utilize rate (FUR)
as the ratio of characters being en-coded into the source audio
to the total number of source audio frames. The experiment
setup is same as the previous one. Figure 17 shows the result.
As expected, audio quality decreases (MCD increases) with
the growth of FUR. On the other hand, we also witness a
decreasing trend of both TSR and CSR as we increase the
FUR from 0.1 to 0.5. This is understandable as a larger FUR
value indicates more adversarial characters are en-coded into
the source audio, hence more characters are prone to errors.
Suggested by this result, we set the maximum FUR to 0.2 by
default in the current Metamorph.
2) Effect of Device Frequency Selectivity: We ﬁrst examine
whether the attack performance of Metamorph is insensitive to
different types of victim devices. We setup a ﬁve-meter (for
Meta-Enha) and three-meter (for Meta-Qual) acoustic link to
launch the attack. We ﬁx the transmitter and then exchange
the receivers to examine the corresponding CSR and TSR.
Figure 18 shows the TSR and CSR achieved by Meta-Qual and
Meta-Enha across four type of receivers. We observe that the
high-end iPhone and Samsung smartphone achieve consistently
high TSR and CSR, which are both around 100%. CSR and
TSR of HTC smartphone (less expensive) drops gradually to
around 90%. While the CSR of Nexus (cheapest one among
