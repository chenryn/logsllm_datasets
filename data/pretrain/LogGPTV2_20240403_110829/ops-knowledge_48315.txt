User: I am looking for a way to periodically send some data over all clients connected to a TCP port. I am looking at twisted python and I am aware of reactor.callLater. But how do I use it to send some data to all connected clients periodically ? The data sending logic is in Protocol class and it is instantiated by the reactor as needed. I don't know how to tie it from reactor to all protocol instances...
Assistant: I'd imagine the easiest way to do that is to manage a list of clients in the protocol with connectionMade and connectionLost in the client and then use a LoopingCall to ask each client to send data.
That feels a little invasive, but I don't think you'd want to do it without the protocol having some control over the transmission/reception.  Of course, I'd have to see your code to really know how it'd fit in well.  Got a github link?  :)
