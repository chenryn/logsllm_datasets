**User:**
I am looking for a way to periodically send data to all clients connected to a TCP port using Twisted Python. I am familiar with `reactor.callLater`, but I'm unsure how to use it to send data to all connected clients on a regular basis. The data-sending logic is within the `Protocol` class, which is instantiated by the reactor as needed. How can I connect the reactor to all protocol instances to achieve this?

**Assistant:**
To periodically send data to all connected clients, you can manage a list of active client connections within the `Protocol` class. You can update this list in the `connectionMade` and `connectionLost` methods. Then, use `LoopingCall` to periodically iterate over this list and send data to each client.

Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Maintain a List of Connected Clients:**
   - In your `Factory` class, maintain a list of all active `Protocol` instances.
   - In the `Protocol` class, add the instance to the list in the `connectionMade` method and remove it in the `connectionLost` method.

2. **Set Up a Periodic Task:**
   - Use `LoopingCall` to create a periodic task that sends data to all clients in the list.

Here’s a basic example to illustrate this:

```python
from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor, task

class MyProtocol(protocol.Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):
        self.factory.clients.append(self)
        print(f"Client connected: {self.transport.getPeer()}")

    def connectionLost(self, reason):
        self.factory.clients.remove(self)
        print(f"Client disconnected: {self.transport.getPeer()}")

    def sendData(self, data):
        self.transport.write(data)

class MyFactory(protocol.Factory):
    def __init__(self):
        self.clients = []

    def buildProtocol(self, addr):
        return MyProtocol()

def sendPeriodicData(factory):
    data = b"Periodic data"
    for client in factory.clients:
        client.sendData(data)
    print("Data sent to all clients")

# Create the factory and start the server
factory = MyFactory()
reactor.listenTCP(8000, factory)

# Set up the LoopingCall to send data every 5 seconds
looping_call = task.LoopingCall(sendPeriodicData, factory)
looping_call.start(5.0)

# Start the reactor
reactor.run()
```

In this example:
- `MyProtocol` adds itself to the `clients` list in `connectionMade` and removes itself in `connectionLost`.
- `sendPeriodicData` is a function that sends data to all clients in the `clients` list.
- `LoopingCall` is used to call `sendPeriodicData` every 5 seconds.

This approach ensures that the `Protocol` instances are managed correctly and that data is sent to all connected clients periodically.

If you have any specific code or additional requirements, feel free to share, and I can provide more tailored advice.
