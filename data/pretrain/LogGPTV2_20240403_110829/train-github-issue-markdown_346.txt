It seems like you are encountering an error while trying to use the `Plots.contour` function in Julia. The issue might be related to the dimensions and shapes of your input data. Let's go through the problem step-by-step to ensure that the inputs are correctly formatted for the `contour` function.

### Problem Description
- **x**: A `Vector{Float64}` with 513 elements.
- **t**: A `Vector{Float64}` with 10001 elements.
- **time_steps**: A `10001x513 Array{Float64,2}`.

### Expected Input Format for `Plots.contour`
The `contour` function in the `Plots` package expects the following inputs:
- **x**: A vector or a 2D array of x-coordinates.
- **y**: A vector or a 2D array of y-coordinates.
- **z**: A 2D array of z-values (heights) corresponding to the (x, y) coordinates.

### Steps to Ensure Correct Input
1. **Check the Dimensions**:
   - The length of `x` should match the number of columns in `time_steps`.
   - The length of `t` should match the number of rows in `time_steps`.

2. **Reshape if Necessary**:
   - If `x` and `t` are vectors, they need to be broadcasted to create a grid of coordinates.

### Code Example
Here is a revised version of your code to ensure the inputs are correctly formatted:

```julia
using Plots

# Given data
x = Vector{Float64}(undef, 513)  # Replace with actual data
t = Vector{Float64}(undef, 10001)  # Replace with actual data
time_steps = rand(10001, 513)  # Replace with actual data

# Check dimensions
@assert length(x) == size(time_steps, 2)
@assert length(t) == size(time_steps, 1)

# Create a grid of (x, t) coordinates
X, T = meshgrid(x, t)

# Plot the contour
contour(X, T, time_steps, title="Contour Plot", xlabel="X", ylabel="T")
```

### Explanation
- **`meshgrid(x, t)`**: This function creates a grid of (x, t) coordinates from the vectors `x` and `t`. The resulting `X` and `T` are 2D arrays where each element corresponds to a (x, t) pair.
- **`contour(X, T, time_steps, ...)`**: This function plots the contour using the grid of (x, t) coordinates and the corresponding `time_steps` values.

### Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues, consider the following:
- **Check Data Types**: Ensure that `x`, `t`, and `time_steps` are all of type `Float64`.
- **Check for NaNs/Infs**: Ensure that there are no `NaN` or `Inf` values in `time_steps`.
- **Update Packages**: Make sure that all your packages, including `Plots` and `GR` (the backend), are up-to-date.

By following these steps, you should be able to create a contour plot without encountering the errors you described.
