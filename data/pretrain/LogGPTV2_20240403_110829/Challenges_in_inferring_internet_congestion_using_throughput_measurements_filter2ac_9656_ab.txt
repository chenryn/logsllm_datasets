### M-Lab's Traceroute Configuration and Data Matching

Each site on the M-Lab platform is configured to initiate a Paris traceroute towards any client that initiates a TCP-based measurement to an M-Lab test server. Specifically, for each NDT (Network Diagnostic Tool) measurement initiated by a client, the server should launch a Paris traceroute towards the client. In the initial deployment of the Paris traceroute service, the infrastructure ran as a single-threaded process. This meant that if the server was performing a traceroute to client \( c1 \) while client \( c2 \) generated a new NDT measurement, the server would not perform a traceroute towards \( c2 \). Additionally, the platform does not explicitly associate an NDT measurement with its corresponding Paris traceroute. The only way to match NDT measurements to their corresponding traceroutes is to search the data for Paris traceroutes executed closely after the NDT measurement.

To address this, we matched NDT tests run by each client with the first traceroute from the server to that same client within a 10-minute window after the NDT test. Using this method, during May 2015, we were able to match 71% (527,480 out of 743,780 NDT tests) from clients to M-Lab servers (with both endpoints in the U.S.). If we relaxed the matching window to allow traceroutes either before or after the NDT test, we could match 87% of NDT tests with traceroutes. Given that incomplete matching was a known issue, we analyzed the NDT and Paris traceroute data from March 2017. We found that in March 2017, we were able to match about the same fraction, 76% of NDT tests (4,689,239 out of 6,185,394) from U.S. M-Lab servers to U.S. clients using a 10-minute window after the NDT test.

### Limitations of M-Lab's Traceroute Support

Another limitation of M-Lab’s traceroute support is that traceroutes are only conducted in one direction (server to client). Clients typically run the NDT client using a web-browser implementation, which lacks the lower-level access required to perform a traceroute to the server. Consequently, paths from clients to M-Lab servers are not visible in this dataset.

### Investigating Assumption #2: Are Servers and Clients in Adjacent ASes?

Using the corpus of traceroute data from M-Lab in May 2015 that we matched with NDT tests, we investigated Assumption 2, i.e., that server and client ASes were generally directly connected. We extracted traces from all U.S. M-Lab servers to clients in 12 major U.S. ISPs listed in the Measuring Broadband America report. To identify clients in various ISPs, we used the prefix-to-AS mapping from CAIDA’s AS-rank project, which utilized public BGP data from May 1-5, 2015.

#### Identifying Interdomain Links in Traceroute

To determine whether the server AS and client AS are directly connected, it is necessary to identify the AS boundaries in the traceroutes. This faces several challenges, such as the numbering of interdomain link interfaces out of either AS's address space. We considered sibling ASes as the same AS hop using information from CAIDA’s AS-to-Organization dataset. To obtain sibling AS lists for the client ASes, we used a manually curated list of sibling ASes for each of the top U.S. ISPs, derived from CAIDA’s AS-to-Organization dataset, Hurricane Electric’s BGP tools, and manual inspection.

#### Analysis of AS Hops

We processed the entire set of matched traceroutes from May 2015 through the MAP-IT algorithm, which infers interdomain links with high accuracy. For each Paris traceroute from the server to client, we used the inference from MAP-IT to determine if the server AS and client AS were directly connected.

We found that 82% of the 383k traces we could analyze toward the 12 ISPs had the server AS directly connected to the client AS. However, this fraction varied considerably by ISP: 91% for AT&T, 96% for Comcast, 82% for CenturyLink, 86% for Verizon, 75% for Time Warner Cable, but only 37% for Charter, 39% for Cox, and 47% for Frontier. Table 1 lists the broadband access providers in the US with more than one million subscribers as of Q3 2015. Correlating these numbers with Figure 1, we find that the top 5 broadband providers — Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Verizon, and CenturyLink — had a high fraction (greater than 80% for all except Time Warner, and greater than 90% for Comcast and AT&T) of observed paths with just one AS hop from the server to client. The fractions were lower for ISPs ranked between 5 and 10 (Charter, Cox, and Frontier).

### Summary

We conclude that the assumption of direct connection between server AS and client AS during May 2015 appeared to be true for the top 5 U.S. residential broadband access providers as of 2015, and not always true for 3 of the top 10 providers. When analyzing NDT tests between a given server and client AS, care must be taken to ensure that the server and client AS are directly connected, using traceroutes and a technique to identify AS boundaries in traceroutes. Given the dynamic nature of AS-level interconnection, these conditions merit periodic re-examination.

### Investigating Assumption #3: Diversity of Interconnection to Access Providers

As discussed in Section 3.1, the simplified AS-level tomographic approach used in the original M-Lab report implicitly assumes that either a) all measurements between the server and clients in the access AS traverse a single IP link or router-level interdomain interconnection, or b) that all IP links or router-level interconnections traversed by those measurements are similar in performance. These assumptions are required because ideally, tests should not be aggregated across multiple links; if they are, they should be across links that are likely to behave similarly. Claffy et al. discuss that interdomain congestion often shows regional effects, making aggregation problematic if links are in different geographical regions.

#### Identification of IP-Level Interdomain Links

In Section 4.2, we used MAP-IT to identify the interdomain links in traceroute paths from May 2015 for AS adjacency analysis. We reused that same dataset to investigate the diversity of router-level interconnection. Specifically, for NDT tests (which could be matched with a corresponding Paris traceroute) from a server in AS S to clients in access AS A, we examined the traceroutes and determined (using MAP-IT) which IP-level interdomain links those traceroutes traversed.

#### Fine-Grained Link-Level Topological Analysis

Our results confirmed that AS-level aggregation of measurements masked the diversity of interconnection between ASes. Table 2 lists the number of interdomain links observed from an M-Lab server in Atlanta hosted by Level 3 to 6 access ISPs, and the number of NDT measurements performed across all observed interconnections with that access ISP in May 2015. Only a single ISP, Frontier, had a significant number of tests (107) that crossed a single interdomain IP link. All paths to other ISPs either had a small representation of measurements (< 100) or crossed multiple interdomain IP links. The distribution of measurements across interdomain links was not uniform. For example, Comcast’s AS22909 had 1,130 measurements traversing one interdomain IP link, while Comcast’s AS7922 had a total of 1767 measurements traversing two interdomain IP links.

#### Summary

Based on our analysis, we conclude that aggregating NDT throughput measurement results at an AS granularity masks the fact that different measurements could cross different IP-level links. The observed geographical spread of the interdomain links is especially problematic given the possibility of regional congestion effects.
