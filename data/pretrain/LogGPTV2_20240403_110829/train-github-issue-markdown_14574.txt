When I click a menu (e.g. File), mouse over to a different menu (e.g. Edit)
and click again, I expect the menu to be dismissed. Instead, it flickers and I
need to click again to dismiss it. If I click the same menu I clicked the
first time (File in the example above), the drop down is dismissed as
expected.
I'm using Atom 1.2.4 on Windows 10. The bug is also present in Visual Studio
Code.
