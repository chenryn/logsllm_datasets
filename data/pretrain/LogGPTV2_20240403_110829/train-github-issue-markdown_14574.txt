When I click on a menu item, such as "File," and then move the mouse to a different menu, such as "Edit," and click again, I expect the initial menu to be dismissed. However, instead of being dismissed, the menu flickers, and I need to click a second time to close it. If I click on the same menu item I initially clicked (e.g., "File" in this case), the dropdown is dismissed as expected.

I am using Atom version 1.2.4 on Windows 10, and I have also observed this issue in Visual Studio Code.
