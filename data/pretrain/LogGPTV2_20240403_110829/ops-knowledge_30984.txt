User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Securing the security guy's home office: what should we do? I read an article in the latest InfoSecurity magazine (an infosec trade rag by Elsevier) saying that us security professionals aren't necessarily taking the correct steps to protect our own home office networks and computers. Now as a security consultant who operates out of my own home office, I ask you how you protect your home office? What should we be doing?

Using my own environment as an example, I go to great lengths to protect my clients' source code (I'm in app security). I also use WPA2 on the router and change the password every so often to try to avoid network sniffing. I have a firewall on each computer, though maybe I don't review the logs as often as I might... and I have backups both locally and offsite. And of course the hardware itself is insured.

So, what have I missed? What would you do? What wouldn't you do? Of course, policies aren't such a good solution because there's only one of me, and I'm not about to fire him ;-)

Assistant: I did a bit of an article on this in the Financial Times 3 or 4 years back but can't find more than the headline piece. Anyway, as I tend to practice what I preach, I have my home set up with networks separated by risk - 


I have one wireless router with two
networks which only connect to the
Internet. A DMZ which just uses WEP
in order for my kids to use their
Nintendo DS's online and another
which is for my local community free
wireless
Another router hosts a secure WPA2
network (mostly for my Playstation 3)
For the wired networks, I have a low
sensitivity network for the rest of
the family - who connect using VMs I
have built for them, and a higher
sensitivity network for most of my
research and non-client activity.
For security testing work for clients
I have a higher security subnet which
requires strong multifactor authentication


For platforms, I have always found the simplest is to use a hardened build for client testing, which can be broken down after testing and reporting is complete. The build has BIOS password and full disk encryption. All machines and servers on all my networks also have firewalls and antivirus and are patched up to date as per vendor guidance.

If you have a security guy working from home, you may find it difficult to audit the kit on site, which can be a problem in terms of managing the risk from them. You typically don't have many solutions here, as they have physical possession of the kit and are effectively unsupervised - understand how much you need to trust them, ensure your contract is appropriate and configure logging as appropriate.

I agree you do need physical security - not only on doors, safes and computer tethers, but also on paper documentation and archives/backups.

Backups and insurance are essential! I use encrypted backups on a site very unlikely to be within the blast radius if my house happens to have a plane land on it (could happen - I'm only a couple of miles off the approach to Edinburgh Airport)
