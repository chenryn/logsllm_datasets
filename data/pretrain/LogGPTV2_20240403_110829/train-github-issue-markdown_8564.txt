In v0.x we used to be able to add the `keyboardFocused` prop to a
`RaisedButton` or `FlatButton` to focus it on render and activate the focus
ripple. In v1, this yields an `Unknown prop` warning on the root element.
We could easily hijack the `autoFocus` prop to set the initial state of the
button, but I'm assuming there is an issue if multiple `autoFocus`ed
components are rendered, so we'd have to verify that this is the actual
focused element when the dom is fully rendered?
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Adding the `autoFocus` prop on a `Button` should trigger the `focusRipple` on
render.
      My button
When looking for the DOM's `activeElement`, the root `button` is already
properly returned.
## Current Behavior
The `button` is focused, but the `focusRipple` doesn't appear.
