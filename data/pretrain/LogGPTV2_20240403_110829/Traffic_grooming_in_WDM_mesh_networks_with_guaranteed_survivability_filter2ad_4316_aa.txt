Abstract—Trafﬁc grooming techniques in optical networks are
attracting increasing research attention in order to handle the
huge bandwidth mismatch between high capacity lightpaths and
low-rate individual trafﬁc requests. It is important to have
guaranteed survivability of all user connections in such networks.
Path protection has emerged as a widely accepted technique for
survivable WDM network design. However, it requires allocating
resources for backup lightpaths, which remain idle under normal
fault-free conditions. In this paper, we introduce a new design
strategy for survivable trafﬁc grooming in WDM networks,
under speciﬁed resource constraints. Our approach addresses the
complete design problem including logical topology design, RWA,
and routing of (subwavelength) requests over the logical topology.
We further ensure that the resultant logical topology is able to
handle the entire trafﬁc request after any single link failure.
We ﬁrst present two ILP formulations for optimally designing
a survivable logical topology, and then propose a heuristic for
larger networks. Experimental results demonstrate that this new
approach is able to provide guaranteed bandwidth, and is much
more efﬁcient in terms of resource utilization, compared to both
dedicated and shared path protection.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) allows a single
ﬁber to support many distinct logical links or lightpaths [5],
[23]. The capacity of a single lightpath can be up to 40 Gbps
(OC-768) in current networks, whereas individual requests
require much lower rates, typically in the range of 155 Mbps
(OC-3) to 622 Mbps (OC-12). Therefore, to ensure effective
resource utilization, it is essential to share the capacity of a
lightpath among several low-speed requests. Trafﬁc grooming
techniques [8], [12], [13], [14], [33], [35], [36], [37] for
optical networks have been introduced to effectively handle
the capacity mismatch between individual trafﬁc requests and
the lightpaths over which these low-speed trafﬁc requests must
be routed. In this context, trafﬁc grooming strategies can be
classiﬁed into two broad categories - static trafﬁc grooming
[35] and dynamic trafﬁc grooming [37]. Static grooming is
used when the trafﬁc requests are known in advance and do
not change signiﬁcantly over relatively long periods of time.
In this case, it is reasonable to spend considerable time to
determine optimal grooming strategies. Dynamic grooming is
appropriate when the pattern of user requests is not known,
connections must be set up on request. We address the static
trafﬁc grooming problem, in this paper.
The complete logical topology design and trafﬁc grooming
problem consists of the following subproblems that have to be
solved simultaneously for optimizing the network cost or the
resource utilization:
Subproblem i) Topology Design (TD): ﬁnd the logical
topology GL of the network,
Subproblem ii) Route
and Wavelength Assignment
(RWA): allocate a route over the physical network and
a WDM channel on each link of the route, for all
lightpaths constituting the logical topology,
Subproblem iii) Trafﬁc Routing (TR): decide which log-
ical path(s) should be used for each data stream so that
the total payload of each edge in the logical path never
exceeds the capacity of one lightpath.
A number of optimal as well as heuristic approaches for
solving the complete design problem for fault-free networks
have been presented in the literature [13], [14], [23], [24], [35].
Failure of a single ﬁber typically results in the disruption of
several logical links and may cause signiﬁcant data loss. Many
schemes have been proposed to handle such faults in WDM
networks [3], [4], [9], [20], [27], [29], [30], [31], [32]. In line
with the assumption made in most work on fault tolerance
[5], [27], we assume in this paper that the probability of two
faults occurring simultaneously is extremely small, and focus
on single link failures. However, our approach can be easily
extended to handle Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) failures
[24] as well.
A standard approach for handling single link failures is the
use of path protection techniques [21], [27]. In this approach,
for every logical edge in the network, resources for two edge-
disjoint lightpaths - the primary lightpath and the backup light-
path are allocated at design time. In dedicated protection, the
resources allocated to a backup path cannot be shared with any
other backup path. Shared path protection improves resource
utilization by allowing resource sharing among two or more
backup paths, if the corresponding primary paths are edge-
disjoint [25]. Both dedicated path and shared path protection
schemes require resources to be reserved for backup paths,
which typically remain idle during normal fault-free operation.
Approximately 50% of network resources remain idle in fault-
free operations in dedicated path protection schemes. This is
reduced to some extent in the case of shared path protection. In
1+1 dedicated path protection, both the primary lightpath and
the backup lightpath are established from the time the network
becomes operational. In 1:1 dedicated path protection and in

after a link fails. One of the disadvantages of establishing
the backup lightpaths, after a fault occurs, is the time to
set up the required back-up lightpaths. This set-up includes
the time to send control signals to the routers, and the time
for reconﬁguring the routers. It is important to note that, if
a path protection scheme is used, the logical topology does
not change when there is a single link failure since each
primary lightpath that uses the failed link is replaced by the
corresponding backup lightpath [21].
An alternative approach to fault-tolerant network design
uses the concept of survivable routing, which ensures that the
RWA of the lightpaths is done in such a way that a single
link failure does not disconnect the network [18]. However,
this typically assumes that the logical topology (i.e. the set
of lightpaths) is already given, and does not consider routing
of subwavelength trafﬁc requests over the logical topology. In
other words, survivable routing focuses solely on subproblem
ii) as stated above. Therefore, the logical topology design
problem [7], [16] is decoupled from the routing and wave-
length assignment (RWA) problem. Such decoupling means
that there may not be any survivable routing corresponding
to a given logical topology and underlying physical network.
Furthermore, even if a feasible survivable routing exists, it
only ensures that the given logical topology remains connected
after a single link failure. It cannot guarantee that the resulting
logical topology will be able to support the required trafﬁc.
In this paper, we present a new approach for solving the
combined survivable trafﬁc grooming and logical topology
design problem, using the non-bifurcated trafﬁc grooming
model [5], [24]. We augment the traditional survivable routing
concept, by integrating the logical topology design and the
trafﬁc routing phases with survivable routing and RWA. Our
scheme thus produces a topology (with a corresponding RWA)
that not only remains connected, but also guarantees that
each individual trafﬁc request can be successfully routed over
the surviving topology for any single link failure. Given an
underlying physical network and trafﬁc request, our approach
designs a logical topology, where the lightpaths that use a
failed link are simply not used in subsequent communication
and the routing scheme to handle the trafﬁc request is modiﬁed
to avoid the disrupted lightpaths.
Trafﬁc grooming schemes can either optimize the resources
required to implement a network capable of handling all trafﬁc
requests, or maximize throughput under speciﬁed network
resource constraints. We have proposed two Integer Linear
Program (ILP) formulations to address the two problems. Our
ﬁrst ILP maximizes the amount of trafﬁc that can be handled
by the network, under speciﬁed resource constraints. The
second formulation minimizes the number of lightpaths (and
consequently the number of expensive optical transceivers)
required to implement a logical topology, capable of handling
all the speciﬁed trafﬁc requests. However, other objectives
such as minimizing the number of wavelength links, or the
congestion of the network can be used as well. When a
physical edge e fails, the low-speed trafﬁc streams are re-
routed over alternate lightpaths, so that the lightpaths that
traverse edge e are not used to carry any trafﬁc. Unlike path
protection, we do not “protect” lightpaths by pre-allocating
resources for backup paths. This approach has two important
advantages:
i) it improves resource utilization, since there is no need
to reserve idle “backup” resources, and
ii) it avoids the “setup” time required for reconﬁgurating
the switches/transceivers along the backup path, before
it can be used 1.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1) We present an integrated ILP formulation for survivable
trafﬁc grooming to design a logical topology that max-
imizes the amount of trafﬁc that can be handled under
speciﬁed resource constraints. The ILP also determines
a survivable routing for this logical topology and routes
individual trafﬁc requests over the topology.
2) We present a second ILP that designs a topology capable
of handling all the trafﬁc requests, with a minimum
number of lightpaths.
3) We show that both ILPs generate a topology, which
not only remains connected, but is capable of handling
the entire trafﬁc request, for any single link failure. We
also provide a feasible routing scheme for each failure
scenario.
4) For large networks, we propose a fast heuristic for inte-
grated survivable trafﬁc grooming and topology design.
5) We demonstrate, through experiments, that our approach
requires signiﬁcantly fewer resources, compared to tra-
ditional approaches based on both dedicated and shared
path protection.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we brieﬂy review some relevant work in survivable
trafﬁc grooming. In Section III, we deﬁne our problem and
present the ILP formulations. In Section IV, we describe the
heuristic approach. We discuss our experimental results in
Section V and conclude with a critical summary in Section
VI.
II. RELATED WORKS
Trafﬁc grooming techniques in WDM networks combine
a number of low-speed trafﬁc streams from different users
for “efﬁcient” use of the high data rate of the lightpaths [8],
[12], [13], [14], [33], [35], [36], [37]. Trafﬁc grooming can
use either the bifurcated model or the non-bifurcated model
[6]. In the non-bifurcated (bifurcated) model, each user data
stream is communicated using a single (one or more) logical
path(s) from the source of the data stream to its destination.
In other words, in the non-bifurcated model, whenever there
is a user request q for communication from a source end-
node sq to a destination end-node dq, the entire data stream
corresponding to request q becomes part of the payload of
each lightpath in the selected logical path from sq to dq. This
1setup time is required only for shared path protection and 1:1 dedicate
path schemes.

model, the data stream corresponding to any request q is
allowed to be split into an arbitrary number of data streams,
each having a lower data communication rates than that of
q, and each data stream being carried by a logical path from
sq to dq. The bifurcated model allows more efﬁcient use of
network resources but the non-bifurcated model has a number
of technological advantages [35].
The survivable trafﬁc grooming problem for WDM optical
mesh networks has been addressed in [3], [9], [20], [32]. A
proposal for trafﬁc grooming over ring networks appears in
[29]. In WDM mesh networks with trafﬁc grooming capa-
bilities, the problem of dynamically establishing dependable
low-rate trafﬁc stream connections has been addressed in [30].
The solution proposed in [30] sets up link-disjoint primary
and backup paths between all pairs of source and destination
nodes and reduces overhead for backup streams using backup
multiplexing. Two grooming schemes were also proposed,
namely, Mixed Primary-Backup Grooming Policy (MGP) and
Segregated Primary-Backup Grooming Policy (SGP). In [4],
the beneﬁt of IP/MPLS protection/restoration in IP-centric
WDM-based optical networks has been studied with dynamic
trafﬁc. In this approach, primary and backup paths for a
request are selected by taking shortest paths from the pre-
computed k-disjoint paths for the source-destination pairs of
the request, provided the resources are available. Wavelength is
assigned following the ﬁrst-ﬁt (FF) policy. Redundant reserved
spare capacity is reduced using backup multiplexing technique.
In this approach, satisfying a connection request ensures the
existence of an active route, as well as a node and link disjoint
alternate route, for the data ﬂow of the request.

ures, such as ﬁber cut and duct cut has been studied by

they have
considered static trafﬁc and focused on the problem with
protection at the subwavelength connection level [31] and
path protection at the lightpath level [32], each under the
general shared risk link group diverse routing constraints.
The authors outlined ILP formulations to generate optimal
solutions for small networks with a limited number of requests,
which were mainly used to validate the results of the proposed
heuristics. The work in [20] focused on different frameworks
for protecting low-speed connections against single link fail-
ures in WDM mesh grooming networks. In this study, the
authors have proposed three approaches for the protection
of connections, namely, protection-at-lightpath (PAL) level,
mixed protection-at-connection (MPAC) level and separate
protection-at-connection (SPAC) level. They have provided
a qualitative comparison among these methods and shown
that, for both shared and dedicated protection, SPAC performs
better with a sufﬁcient number of grooming ports, and PAL
performs better with a small to a moderate number of such
ports. The authors have also proposed heuristics for provi-
sioning dynamically arriving connections. The study in [3],
has also used lightpath level protection or connection level
protection with shared backup resources, to combat failure,
but this work has focused on handling multiple link failures.
In the case of non-bifurcated trafﬁc grooming using path
protection, each request is allotted to a single logical path.
Since each primary lightpath has a corresponding back-up
lightpath where the route of the back-up lightpath is edge-
disjoint with respect to the route used by the primary lightpath,
each logical edge is robust against single link failure. In other
words, the logical topology is robust with respect to single link
faults. This approach is used in [9], [27], where the concept
of backup multiplexing is extended to include cases where
primary paths may not be edge-disjoint. If two primary paths
are not edge disjoint, the corresponding backup paths are still
allowed to share the same link and channel, provided sufﬁcient
bandwidth exists in the backup paths.
Our approach does not use any “protection paths”, but en-
sures that there is sufﬁcient spare capacity in the lightpaths to
re-route all the trafﬁc for all single link failure scenarios. This
is somewhat similar to the concept of “L+1 fault tolerance”
discussed [10], [22]. However, these papers deal with dynamic
lightpath allocation, where lightpaths are rerouted based on
speciﬁc failure scenarios. Requests are processed, one at a time
and these approaches do not consider integrated optimization
over all trafﬁc requests. Furthermore, the connection requests
are at the lightpath level, so subwavelength trafﬁc grooming is
