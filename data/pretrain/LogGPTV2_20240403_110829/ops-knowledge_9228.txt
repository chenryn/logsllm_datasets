User: I have created a small python script of mine. I saved the pickle file on Linux and then used it on windows and then again used it back on Linux but now that file is not working on Linux but it is working perfectly on windows. 
Is is so that python is coss-platform but the pickle file is not.
Is there any solution to this one???
Assistant: Python's pickle is perfectly cross-platform.
This is likely due to EOL (End-Of-Line) differences between Windows and Linux. Make sure to open your pickle files in binary mode both when writing them and when reading them, using open()'s "wb" and "rb" modes respectively.
Note: Passing pickles between different versions of Python can cause trouble, so try to have the same version on both platforms.
