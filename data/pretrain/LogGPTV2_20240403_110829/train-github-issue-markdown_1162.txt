  * `export` and `default` are keywords and should be colored accordingly
  * A class should be colored too
  * `render` is a method and should be colored accordingly
  * `const` is a keyword and should be colored accordingly
  * `{'this is a string and has to be colored accordingly'}`
  * string interpolation should work inside jsx parameters
