User: Update: The question still lacks a satisfactory answer. 
I would like to "send" code snippets to a IPython interpreter in Emacs 23.2 (Linux). Assuming that I have already started an IPython shell in a buffer in Emacs (e.g. using Python-mode.el and IPython.el), is there a way of selecting a region in a different buffer and "sending" this region to the already-started IPython shell?
I have tried C-c C-c (send-buffer-to-shell) and C-c | (send-region-to-shell), but this only works as long as the code is written in Python and not in IPython (IPython can run Python code). The reason seems to be that, for both commands, Emacs creates a temporary file with .py extension (as opposed to with .ipy extension), which then is interpreted by IPython as "Python-specific code". This prevents me from using IPython-specific features 
such as magic commands.
On a separate note, I have also read that Emacs provides M-| ('shell-command-on-region') to run selected regions in a shell. To do this with an IPython interpreter, I have tried setting shell-file-name to my IPython path. However, when I run M-| after selecting a region, Emacs prompts me the following:

Shell command on region:

and if I then type RET, I get the IPython man page on the *Shell Command Output* buffer, without the region being executed. Is there any IPython-specific command that I can use for M-| ('shell-command-on-region') to get IPython run my code?
Thanks!
Assistant: I found a partial answer to Q1: 
Python-mode provides C-c C-c which can send a buffer to an already-opened Python shell (similarly C-c C-| can send a region to the shell), and if ipython.el is installed, then default python shell is set to IPython.
Unfortunately, this only works for python scripts, and not for IPython scripts. C-c C-c works by copying the buffer with the code snippet to a temporary file with extension .py that is then sent to the shell. Since the file has extension .py IPython executes it as if it was regular Python code, and therefore the code snippet cannot have IPython-specific code (such as IPython magic commands)..
