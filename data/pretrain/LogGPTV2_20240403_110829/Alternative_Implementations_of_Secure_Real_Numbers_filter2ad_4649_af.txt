### Figure 1: Performance and Accuracy Trade-offs for Various Real Number Representations

**Description:**
This figure illustrates the trade-offs between performance and accuracy for different real number representations. The y-axis represents the performance in operations per second, while the x-axis shows the absolute or relative error. 

- **Performance (y-axis):** Higher values indicate better performance.
- **Accuracy (x-axis):** Lower values indicate higher accuracy.
- **Error Measurement:** In most cases, the maximum relative error is measured. However, in a few instances, the maximum absolute error is used, which is denoted by "A".

**Annotations:**
- Operations that achieve perfect accuracy within their representation are marked with an asterisk (*).
- The value of half the step between two consecutive numbers in the representation is plotted.

**Subplots:**
- **(a) Addition:**
  - Performance vs. Relative Error
  - Perfect accuracy is achieved in some representations, indicated by asterisks.
  
- **(b) Multiplication:**
  - Performance vs. Relative Error
  - Perfect accuracy is not always achievable, as shown by the varying error levels.

- **(c) Reciprocal:**
  - Performance vs. Absolute Error
  - The error ranges from \(10^{-2}\) to \(10^{-20}\).

- **(d) Square Root:**
  - Performance vs. Relative Error
  - The error ranges from \(10^{-4}\) to \(10^{-19}\).

- **(e) Exponentiation:**
  - Performance vs. Absolute Error
  - The error ranges from \(10^{-3}\) to \(10^{-18}\).

- **(f) Natural Logarithm:**
  - Performance vs. Relative Error
  - Different representations (Lh, Ls, Ld, floats, floatd, G32, G64, G128, fix32, fix64) are compared.
  - The error ranges from \(10^{-5}\) to \(10^{-15}\).

**Conclusion:**
The figure highlights the balance between computational efficiency and numerical precision for various arithmetic operations and number representations. It provides valuable insights into the trade-offs that must be considered when selecting a suitable representation for specific applications.
