A SYSTEM STATE UNDER NORMAL
OPERATION
During the normal operation of the plant, we can estimate the
state of the system based on system model equations (1) and state
estimation equations (3).
Proposition 1. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Under the normal operation of the plant, it can be shown that the
state estimation error is ek +1 = (A − LC)ek + vk − Lηk.
Proof : The state estimation error is the difference between real
system state and estimated system state and can be presented as,
(25)
From system state equation (1) and state estimation equation (3),
by substituting the equations for xk +1and ˆxk +1 we get,
ek +1 = xk +1 − ˆxk +1
ek +1 = Axk + Buk + vk − Aˆxk − Buk − L(yk − ˆyk)
For yk = Cxk + ηk and ˆyk = C ˆxk we get,
ek +1 = A(xk − ˆxk) + vk − L(Cxk + ηk − C ˆxk)
(26)
(27)
As ek = xk − ˆxk we get,
ek +1 = Aek + vk − LCek − Lηk
ek +1 = (A − LC)ek + vk − Lηk
(28)
(29)
This completes the proof.
■
Proposition 2. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Under the normal operation of the plant, it can be shown that the
residual vector is rk = Cek + ηk.
Proof : The residual vector is the difference between real sensor
measurement and estimated sensor reading and can be presented
as,
(30)
From equation for system model (1) we know yk = Cxk +ηk and ˆyk =
C ˆxk then,
rk = yk − ˆyk

rk = Cxk + ηk − C ˆxk
rk = C(xk − ˆxk) + ηk
where we have ek = xk − ˆxk,
(31)
(32)
rk = Cek + ηk
(33)
This completes the proof.
■
Proposition 3. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Under the normal operation of the plant, it can be shown that
j =0 [Aj LCek−1−j + Aj Buk−1−j +
the state estimation is ˆxk = k−1
Aj Lηk−1−j] + Ak x0.
Proof : As shown previously state estimation equation using Kalman
filter gain L is given as,
ˆxk +1 = Aˆxk + Buk + L(cid:0)¯yk − ˆyk
(cid:1),
(34)
where ¯y(k) is the sensor measurement which might be under
attack and can be represented in terms of attack vector δk,
For the normal operation, there is no attack and δk = 0,
¯yk = yk + δk ,
(cid:1),
ˆxk +1 = Aˆxk + Buk + L(cid:0)yk + δk − ˆyk
(cid:1),
ˆxk +1 = Aˆxk + Buk + L(cid:0)yk − ˆyk
ˆxk +1 = Aˆxk + Buk + L(cid:0)Cxk + ηk − C ˆxk
(cid:1),
(35)
(36)
(37)
(38)
ˆxk +1 = Aˆxk + Buk + LCek + Lηk ,
(39)
Let ˆx0 = x0, and by iterative solution of above equation with
k = 0, we get, ˆx1 = Aˆx0 + Bu0 + LCe0 + Lη0 and as ˆx0 = x0, this
gives,
(40)
For ˆx2 we have, ˆx2 = Aˆx1 + Bu1 + LCe1 + Lη1. Substituting ˆx1
ˆx1 = Ax0 + Bu0 + LCe0 + Lη0,
from previous iteration, we get,
x0 + ABu0 + ALCe0 + ALη0 + Bu1 + LCe1 + Lη1,
2
ˆx2 = A
(41)
For ˆx3 we have, ˆx3 = Aˆx2 + Bu2 + LCe2 + Lη2. Substituting ˆx2
from previous iteration, we get,
3
ˆx3 = A
2
x0 + A
2
Bu0 + A
2
LCe0 + A
Lη0 + ABu1 + ALCe1 + ALη1
+Bu2 + LCe2 + Lη2,
(42)
By induction we can write for the kth entry as,
k−1
j=0
ˆxk =
[Aj LCek−1−j + Aj Buk−1−j + Aj Lηk−1−j] + Ak x0
(43)
This completes the proof.

B.2 Under a Stealthy Attack
Following results are for the case of a stealthy attack δk = β[Cek +
ηk] + α.
Proposition 4. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Under the generalized attack (11) δk on the plant, it can be shown
that the state estimation error is ek +1 = Aek + vk − (β + 1)LCek −
(β + 1)Lηk − Lα.
Proof : The proof follows from the proposition 4A by using attack
vector in equation (11),
(44)
(45)
ek +1 = Aek + vk − LCek − Lηk − Lδk
This completes the proof.
Using δk = β[Cek + ηk] + α we get,
ek +1 = Aek + vk − LCek − Lηk − L[δk = β[Cek + ηk] + α]
ek +1 = Aek + vk − (β + 1)LCek − (β + 1)Lηk − Lα

■
Proposition 5. Consider the process (1), the Kalman filter (3)-(5).
Under the generalized attack (11) δk on the plant, it can be shown
that the residual vector is rk = (β + 1)Cek + (β + 1)ηk + α.
Proof : The proof follows from the proposition 5A by using attack
vector in equation (11),
Using δk = β[Cek + ηk] + α we get,
rk = Cek + ηk + δk
rk = Cek + ηk + β[Cek + ηk] + α
rk = (β + 1)Cek + (β + 1)ηk + α
