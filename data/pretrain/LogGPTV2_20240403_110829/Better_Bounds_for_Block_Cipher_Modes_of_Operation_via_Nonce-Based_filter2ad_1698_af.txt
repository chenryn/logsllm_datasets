Let A be a (t, N, (cid:126)QE , (cid:126)QD , (cid:126)B, a, m)-nonce adversary. Recall that (cid:126)QE
and (cid:126)QD are vectors where Qi
denote the number of times
A queries its encryption and decryption oracle, respectively, with
E
the ith nonce. In addition, (cid:126)B = (B1, . . . , BN) is such that Bi blocks
overall are encrypted or decrypted using the ith nonce. For the
AES-GCM-SIV scheme, this includes the message blocks and the
one additional block used to mask the hash result. Finally, a and m
are such that the longest AAD is less than 2a blocks and the longest
message is less than 2m blocks. Since we are now considering the
nonce-misuse case, (cid:126)QE can be an arbitrary vector; this is unlike the
nonce-respecting case where Qi

are interested in large values of N (for small values of N the bounds
are very good in any case), we take the term 6N296 . Thus, we choose
to use:
6N296 if and only if N  1 only if there exist multiple di(cid:29)erent nonces (resulting
in multiple di(cid:29)erent derived keys) and messages, resulting in the
same T AG. (To be exact, µ > 1 if the same counter is input in any
position, and so if the tags are close then this may happen.) For
simplicity, we bound the probability that the most signi(cid:27)cant 94
bits of the tag are the same, since if these are di(cid:29)erent then the
input to AES in encryption is always di(cid:29)erent. Now, this event is
just the probability of a multicollision on di(cid:29)erent inputs. Using
Theorem 2.1, the probability of a multicollision of 5 or more is
2383 . Thus, even for N = 264, this
upper bound by
probability is negligible at 2−63. We can therefore take µ = 5 as a
very conservative bound. Thus, we can write

It remains to analyze AdvEncRFN
, which is the advan-
tage of the adversary in the nonce-misuse resistant setting, when a
random function is used to encrypt all messages. In this setting, for
every di(cid:29)erent nonce, a random GHASH function is chosen,8 as
well as random functions for counter-based encryption. For the sake
of our analysis, the following informal description of encryption—
replacing AES with a truly random function—su(cid:28)ces (see [12] for
a full speci(cid:27)cation):
(1) The universal hash function is applied to the additional authen-
ticated data (AAD) and plaintext message; denote the output
by T .
(2) The random function is applied to T ⊕ N (pre(cid:27)xed by a single
zero), where N is the input nonce; denote the output by T AG.
(3) The initial counter is set to be T AG, pre(cid:27)xed by a single one,
and CTR-encryption is used from the counter. (The pre(cid:27)xing
with zero and one is used to ensure that the same input is never
provided to the random function to derive T AG in the previous
step, and to encrypt in this step.)
 1. In contrast, in
Eq. (16), the dominant term is N·Bmax2
, which for these parameters
2n+1
equals 288
We stress that a similar analysis appears in [13]. However, the
analysis there concludes that if there exists an adversary A for
AES-GCM-SIV then there exists an adversary A2 that distinguishes
AES from a random function, where A2 running time is N times
the running time of A. In contrast, in our result, A2’s running-time
is in the same order as A. For the parameters we are considering
with N = 248, the analysis of [13] is meaningless. In particular,
let the running-time of A be T = 248. Then, we would have no
contradiction, since an adversary running in time N · T = 296 can
easily distinguish AES from a random function. Nevertheless, this
is an artifact of the analysis in [13] and not the actual bounds, as
we have shown here.

We now proceed to consider nonce misuse. In this case, we now

need to consider the additional advantage from the term
2n−m−2
recall that Bi is the number of times that the same nonce is reused.
It follows that the advantage is below the NIST recommendation
< 294−m (plugging in n = 128). Con-
cretely, if short messages are encrypted (say, m ≤ 216), then this
is achieved even for N = 245 and Bi = 210, or for N = 232 and
Bi = 215. For longer messages of length 230, this is achieved for
example with N = 225 and Bi = 26. In addition to the above, we
need to consider the term N·Bmax2
, where Bmax is the maximum
2n+1
numbers of blocks encrypted with a single nonce. For the values of
N, Bi and m above, we have that Bmax = Bi · m (since we are con-
sidering that all messages and nonce misuse is of the same maximal
length). Thus, for m = 216, N = 245, and Bi = 210 we have that the
probability is 245·(210+16
= 2−32. Likewise, for m = 216, N = 232
2129
and Bi = 215, we have that the probability is 232·(215+16
= 2−35.
2129
For the setting of longer messages with the parameters above, this
term is also below 2−32, as required. By inspection, one can verify
that all other terms are dominated by the above two.
