User: Hello i want to know the best way to re import or re execute a module, because i have a web server with just one Apache session for all my domains and applications, and i if i need to make some changes on one application restart the server will affect the others, so looking for the best way to recall a module. If i choose subprocess i will need to print the response but i don' t know is that most secure way of communication. Please tell me in your experience which is the best way?
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: Reloading a module is rarely a good idea in a production environment; it's a mechanism intended for debugging. When you reload a module, the module's contents (classes, function, data) get replaced, but existing references to these items from other modules are not affected. This is particularly important for classes: existing objects in memory still refer to the old class, whereas objects generated after the reload refer to the new class.
There is another alternative you might want to consider: load Python code from a file and exec it. Less overhead than a complete subprocess, and less tightly coupled to the rest of a program than a module. In principle the same caveats apply to re-exec-ing as to reloading a module, but you are much less tempted to have references to exec'd code because it's more work.
