**Possible Bug or Issue:**

I am encountering an issue that I do not fully understand. The label has the following CSS style applied to it:
```css
.hidden-xs { display: block !important; }
```
On small (sm), medium (md), and large (lg) screen sizes, the label is being moved to a new line, causing a visual deformation in the interface.

For more details, please refer to the code snippet here: [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/Roosso/6762675)

P.S. Apologies for any language errors.
