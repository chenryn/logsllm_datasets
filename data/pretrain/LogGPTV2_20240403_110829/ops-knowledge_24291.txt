User: Probably a very simple question. I just thought, after someone suggested it here, of trying (and installing) Python 3.6 on a Mac - I've been happily using 2.7 since now. I've never used the IDLE before having done everything via the command line + ATOM to write the program. 
I see that 'normally' you should be able to write your program in the shell and then run it in the RUN window. However, I don't see a RUN mode in window, just the possibility of using, which you are anyhow, the shell window. I hope that makes sense!
Is this normal, or have I missed something? 
p.s. I'm using OS X 10.8, if that's of any importance.
Assistant: I am not exactly sure what you are asking, and whether it has anything to do with OSX, but I can explain IDLE.  IDLE has two types of main window: a single Shell and multiple Editor windows.
Shell simulates python running in the interactive REPL mode that you get when you enter 'python' (or 'python3') in a console or terminal window.  (The latter depends on the OS.)  You enter statements at the >>> prompt.  A single-line statement is run when you hit Enter (or Return).  A multi-line statement is run when you hit Enter twice.  This is the same as in interactive Python.
Editor windows let you enter a multi-statement program.  You run the programs by selecting Run and Run module from the menu or by hitting the shortcut key, which by default is F5 (at least on Windows and Linux).  This runs the program much the same as if you enter python -i myprogram.py in a console.  Program output and input goes to and is received from the Shell window.  When the program ends, Python enters interactive mode and prints an interactive prompt (>>>).  One can then interact with the objects created by the program.
You are correct that Run does not appear on the menu bar of the Shell.  It is not needed as one runs a statement with the Enter key.
