Currently you can mix BM25 and the classic similarity in the same index:
    {
      "book" : {
        "properties" : {
          "title" : { "type" : "text", "similarity" : "BM25" },
          "text" : { "type" : "text", "similarity" : "classic" }
        }
    }
... this can be buggy since the base similarity cannot be picked properly. The
base similarity is used to compute a factor for the coordinates and the query
norm (cf Similarity.coord and Similarity.queryNorm).  
It is a per query setting that can change the score completely. For `BM25` the
coord and the queryNorm are disabled (returns 1.0f) whereas they are important
factors in the `classic` similarity. To resolve this we have two settings for
the index similarity `index.similarity.default.type` and
`index.similarity.base.type`.  
In order to make the things easier we could have a single setting:  
`index.similarity.type`  
... that is dynamically updatable if the similarities are compatible:  
#6727  
This would not make the "are compatible?" easier but this would prevent the
user to shoot themselves in the foot.
