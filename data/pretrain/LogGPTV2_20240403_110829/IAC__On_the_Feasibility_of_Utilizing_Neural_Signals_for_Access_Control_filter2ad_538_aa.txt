ABSTRACT
Access control is the core security mechanism of an operating sys-
tem (OS). Ideally, the access control system should enforce context
integrity, i.e., an application can only access security and privacy
sensitive resources expected by users. Unfortunately, existing ac-
cess control systems, including the permission systems in modern
OS like iOS and Android, all fail to enforce context integrity thus
allow apps to abuse their permissions. A naive approach to enforce
context integrity is to prompt users every time a sensitive resource
is accessed, but this will quickly lead to habituation. The state-of-
art solutions include (1) user-driven access control, which binds a
predened context to protected GUI elements and (2) predicting
users’ authorization decision based on their previous behaviors and
privacy preferences. However, previous studies have shown that
the rst approach is vulnerable to attacks (e.g., clickjacking) and
the second approach is challenging to implement as it is dicult
to infer the context. In this work, we explore the feasibility of a
novel approach to enforce the context integrity—by inferring what
task users want to do under the given context from their neural
signals; then automatically authorizes access to a predened set of
sensitive resources that are necessary for that task. We conducted
a comprehensive user study including 41 participants where we
collected their neural signals when they were performing tasks
that required access to sensitive resources. After preprocessing and
features extraction, we trained machine learning classier to infer
what kind of tasks a user wants to perform. The experiment results
show that the classier was able to infer the high-level intents like
take a photo with a weighted average precision of 88%.

1 INTRODUCTION
Access control is the core security mechanism of an operating sys-
tem (OS). It decides what resources a subject can access and in
what way the access can be performed (e.g., read, write, execute).
Classic access control models include Discretionary Access Control
(DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Role-based Access Con-
trol, Attribute-based Access Control, etc. An important property of
all these models is that a subject is not the human user, but a pro-
cess/thread that operates on behalf of the human user (i.e., a proxy).
Therefore, the eectiveness of these models heavily relies on the
assumption that the software truly operates as the user intended.
This assumption generally held in the early era of computing his-
tory when software was either written by users themselves or by a
trusted authority (e.g., an administrator). However, with the boom
of the software industry, this assumption no longer holds—as users,
we usually do not fully understand what a piece of software truly
does. Consequently, numerous security and privacy issues arise.
For example, ransomware can abuse our credentials to encrypt our
les and spyware can easily steal our private information.
Modern operating systems like iOS and Android use sandbox and
permission system to mitigate this threat. In these systems, apps
are no longer trusted—by default, they can only access to their own
les and limited system resources. Accesses to user-owned data and
privacy sensitive sensors are mediated by the permission system
through which user can decide either to allow the accesses or deny
them. While this is a step forward, the problem of these systems (iOS
and Android M+) is that they only ask users to authorize the rst
access to the protected resources, a.k.a., ask-on-rst-use (AOFU).
Any subsequent access to the same resource will be automatically
allowed unless users manually revoke the permission. However,
since an app can have dierent functionalities and the resources
may be used under quite dierent context, recent research results
have shown that AOFU failed to protect users’ privacy over half of
the time [65].
A straightforward idea to solve this problem is to prompt user
every time a protected resource is about to be accessed. However,
as the number of accessing requests can be huge (e.g., Wijesekera et
al. found that a single app can make tens of hundreds of requests
per day [65]), this approach can easily cause habituation and loose
its eectiveness. So, the real challenge is how to reduce the number
of prompts without sacricing users’ privacy.

M. Rahman et al.
A general idea to solve this challenge is to infer what decision a
user is likely to make thus avoiding redundant prompts [33, 38, 41,
47, 55, 57, 66]. Existing solutions can be divided into two directions.
Solutions in the rst direction associate GUI gadget with predened
context, then extract user’s authorization from their interactions
with the gadget, a.k.a. user-driven access control [33, 38, 41, 51, 55–
57, 59, 67]. For example, a downloaded le is allowed to be executed
only if the user has clicked the “Save” button to save it [38]; an email
is allowed to be sent only if the user has clicked the “Send” button
and its content must match what is displayed on screen [33]; and
only when the user clicks the “Camera” button can an app access
the camera device [41, 55, 57]. However, this associating user’s
authorization to GUI gadgets has two major drawbacks. First, there
are many GUI attacks that can mislead the user, such as clickjacking
attacks [30]. For this reason, existing user-driven access control
models have to employ additional steps to prevent such attacks,
e.g., by isolating the gadgets from the application and letting the OS
to render [57]. Secondly and more importantly, not all legitimate
resources accesses are initiated from user interaction [23].
to explore the feasibility of utilizing these sensors to infer user’s
intent through answering the following research questions:
• Q1: Is it possible to extract high-level intents (e.g., taking a
photo) from the neural signals with a machine learning classi-
er?
• Q2: Is the accuracy of the classier high enough to support
automated authorization?
To answer these questions, we designed and conducted a user
study with 41 participants. Experiment over the collected data
indicates that the answers to the above research questions are
mostly positive. Specically, our classier is able to distinguish
four dierent high-level intents (taking a photo, taking a video,
choosing a photo from the gallery, and cancel) with a weighted
average Precision of 88.34%, while the weighted average Recall is
86.52%, and the weighted average F − measure is 86.92%.
Contributions. In brief, our contributions in this paper are:
• We designed a new intent-driven access control model that
relies on inferring of user’s high-level intents through the
brain-computer interface (BCI).
• We experimentally validated the feasibility of constructing
such a system with consumer-grade EEG headset via a user
study of 41 participants. Our experimental results show the
feasibility of intent-driven access control. To our best knowl-
edge, this is the rst study of utilizing brain signals to protect
users’ privacy.

background on Electroencephalography (EEG), Event-related po-
tential (ERP), Emotiv Epoc + headset and Brain Computer Interface
(BCI) which are required to understand our study, §3 introduces the
threat model of our new access control design and how it works,
§4 presents the experiments design and experimental procedures,
§5 provides the details of how raw EEG data is processed before
feeding into a machine learning algorithm, §6 empirically answers
the two research questions, §7 discusses the limitations of our ex-
isting design and possible future work, §8 compares our work with
related research, and §9 concludes the paper.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we give the background of Electroencephalography
(EEG), event-related potential (ERP), Emotiv Epoc + headset and
Brain Computer Interface (BCI).
EEG. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a monitoring technique that
records the brain’s electrical activities. The recorded EEG data is a
time series data. Voltage uctuations generated from neurons inside
the brain are captured by electrodes and amplied. The electrodes
are usually placed in a non-invasive way (i.e., attached to the skin
of the head scalp), but they can also be used invasively. For this
study, we used non-invasive EEG sensors.
Event-Related Potentials. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are
small but measurable (with an EEG sensor) voltages changes gen-
erated by the brain in response to a stimulus event. The stimulus
events include a wide range of cognitive, sensory, or motor activ-
ities, such as showing dierent letters to the participants, or in
our experiments, performing a given task with mobile apps. ERPs
The second direction is to predict users’ authorization decision
based on their privacy preference [37], privacy prole [36], or pre-
vious authorization decisions and other behaviors [47, 66]. Because
the decisions are usually context-sensitive, the biggest challenge for
this direction is how to infer the context. Olejnik et al. used 32 raw
features to dene a unique context but admitted that they are not
exhaustive [47]. Wijesekera et al. believed that the problem of infer-
ring the exact context in an automated way is likely to be intractable
thus focused on inferring when context has changed [66].
In this study, we explore the feasibility of a new way to in-
fer users’ authorization decisions—by directly inferring their intent
through the brain-computer interface. Our observation is that the
notion of contextual integrity [46] suggests that each unique con-
text will setup a set of corresponding social norms on how users
would expect their privacy information to be used. Whenever the
information is used in ways that defy the users’ expectations, a
privacy violation occurs. Applying this notion to the access control
systems (permission models) implies that we can automate the au-
thorization process by (1) associating each context of an app with
a functionality it appears to perform; (2) associating each function-
ality with a set of expected sensitive resources that are necessary
(i.e.norms); and (3) limiting the requested resources to the expected
set. However, as discussed earlier, the rst step—inferring func-
tionality from a context is very dicult. The key idea behind our
approach is that we can actually avoid solving this challenging
problem by utilizing our brain as a “magic” inference engine to
directly output the result: what is the intended functionality the user
wants to perform under the given context. Once we can infer intents
from the user’s brain signals, we can easily follow step (2) and (3)
to make authorization decisions.
As the rst footprint towards this direction, this work studies
the feasibility of constructing such a decision-making system based
on non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) headset. Recent
advances of the EEG sensor technology have enabled us to use
consumer-grade headset to capture brain signals that used to be only
available to clinical settings with invasive probes. Utilizing these
EEG sensors, researchers have shown it is possible to recognize
simple mental tasks as well as playing games. In this study, we aim

are time-locked to the stimulus, i.e., given stimuli, an EEG voltage
change is always expected in a known time frame. Because the volt-
age changes are small, ERPs are calculated by averaging multiple
trials of the time-locked EEG samples. This procedure will lter
out the background EEG noise and extract ERPs. The resulting ERP
waveforms consist of a sequence of positive and negative voltage
deections, which are called components. So far, researchers have
discovered more than a dozen ERP components [61]. Among them,
the most well-studied ERP component is P300 or P3 wave.
Emotiv EPOC+ Headset. The Emotiv EPOC+ wireless headset
(Figure 1) [20] is a consumer-grade EEG device that is widely used
in gaming and entertainment industry. It allows gamers to control
computer game based on their thoughts or facial expression [54].
We used this device in our study because it is signicantly less ex-
pensive than other clinical-grade EEG devices and is more portable.
For this reason, it is also widely used in research projects [40, 44].
The headset consists 14 data collecting electrodes (AF3, AF42, F3,
F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, O1, O2, P7, P8, and T7, T8) and two reference
electrodes (CMS/DRL). The electrodes are placed according to the
International 10-20 system (Figure 1).
Getting good quality signal from the Emotiv headset requires
pressing the two references for 5s or more before data collection.
