👋 team,
I am working on DocSearch , an algolia tool. We are proud to feature the
search from your documentation website.
Congrats for the v7 👏
It needed an update from our side in order to avoid having duplicates from v7
and the latest 6.26.3. No worries, everything is proactively updated (we
monitor big changes)
If you want, we do offer filtering over `language` and `version`. Since you
are using Docusaurus, the `version` and `language` filters are handled
automatically from the Search-UI. We will need you to enable it and check that
your Docusaurus instance is updated.
Please ping me if you want to enable this feature. I will PR the required
changes from your DocSearch configuration.
Your website will have an adaptive search instead of only retrieving the
latest version.
