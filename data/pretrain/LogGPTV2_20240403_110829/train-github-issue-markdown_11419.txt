Hello Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm currently working on DocSearch, a tool provided by Algolia. We are proud to feature the search functionality from your documentation website.

Congratulations on the release of version 7! ðŸŽ‰

To ensure that we avoid duplicates between v7 and the latest 6.26.3, we have proactively updated our system. Rest assured, we continuously monitor for significant changes and make updates as needed.

If you are interested, we offer filtering options for `language` and `version`. Since you are using Docusaurus, the `version` and `language` filters are automatically handled by the Search-UI. To enable these features, you will need to update your Docusaurus instance and enable the filters.

Please let me know if you would like to activate this feature. I can submit a pull request (PR) with the necessary changes to your DocSearch configuration.

Enabling these filters will allow your website to provide an adaptive search experience, rather than only retrieving the latest version.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
