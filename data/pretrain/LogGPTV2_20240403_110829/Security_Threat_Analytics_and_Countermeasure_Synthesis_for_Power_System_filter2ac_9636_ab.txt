  - **ml i:** Whether line \( i \) is considered (though it may not exist) in the topology (Boolean).

#### 2. Formalization of State Estimation Changes
- The attack on state \( x_j \) specifies that the phase angle at bus \( j \) is changed. This condition is formalized as:
  \[
  \forall 1 \leq j \leq n, \; c x_j \rightarrow (\Delta \theta_j \neq 0)
  \]

- From Equation (3), a change in \( P_L^i \) is required based on changes in states \( x_{lf_i} \) and/or \( x_{lt_i} \). In the case of false data injection, \( P_L^i \), \( \theta_{lf_i} \), and \( \theta_{lt_i} \) are changed to \( P_{\Delta L}^i \), \( \theta_{\Delta lf_i} \), and \( \theta_{\Delta lt_i} \). The resulting equation is:
  \[
  P_{\Delta L}^i = l_d^i (\theta_{\Delta lf_i} - \theta_{\Delta lt_i})
  \]
  \[
  \Delta P_L^i = P_{\Delta L}^i - P_L^i = l_d^i (\Delta \theta_{lf_i} - \Delta \theta_{lt_i})
  \]
  If \( \Delta \theta_{lf_i} \neq 0 \) or \( \Delta \theta_{lt_i} \neq 0 \), then state \( x_{lf_i} \) or \( x_{lt_i} \) is changed (i.e., attacked). This relation holds only if the line is taken in the topology:
  \[
  \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; m l_i \rightarrow (\Delta P_L^i = l_d^i (\Delta \theta_{lf_i} - \Delta \theta_{lt_i}))
  \]
  If a line is not considered in the topology, there should be no requirement for false data injection:
  \[
  \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; \neg m l_i \rightarrow (\Delta P_L^i = 0)
  \]

#### 3. Formalization of Topology Changes
- **Inclusion and Exclusion Attacks:**
  - A line can be included in the topology if it is open in reality:
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; m l_i \rightarrow (t l_i \land \neg e l_i) \lor (\neg t l_i \land i l_i)
    \]
  - A line can be excluded from the topology if it exists in the real topology and is not securely fixed:
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; e l_i \rightarrow t l_i \land \neg f l_i \land \neg s l_i
    \]
  - A line can be included in the topology if it is not in the real topology and is not securely fixed:
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; i l_i \rightarrow \neg t l_i \land \neg s l_i
    \]

- **Measurement Alteration:**
  - Measurement \( z_i \) is altered only if it is taken and the corresponding power measurement is changed:
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; c z_i \rightarrow m z_i \land (\Delta P_L^i \neq 0)
    \]
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; c z_{l+i} \rightarrow m z_{l+i} \land (\Delta P_L^i \neq 0)
    \]
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq j \leq b, \; c z_{2l+j} \rightarrow m z_{2l+j} \land (\Delta P_B^j \neq 0)
    \]

#### 4. Formalization of Attack Attributes
- **Attacker’s Knowledge:**
  - If the admittance of a line is unknown, the adversary cannot determine the necessary changes in the power flow measurements:
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; c z_i \lor c z_{l+i} \rightarrow b d_i
    \]
  - Example of specifying the attacker’s knowledge about the admittances of the lines:
    \[
    b d_1 \land b d_2 \land b d_3 \land \neg b d_4 \land \cdots \land b d_l
    \]

- **Attacker’s Accessibility:**
  - The attacker can only change measurement \( z_i \) if it is accessible and not secured:
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq m, \; c z_i \rightarrow a z_i \land \neg s z_i
    \]
  - Example of specifying whether a measurement is secured or accessible:
    \[
    \neg s z_1 \land s z_2 \land \neg s z_3 \land \neg s z_4 \land \cdots \land s z_m
    \]
    \[
    a z_1 \land \neg a z_2 \land a z_3 \land \neg a z_4 \land \cdots \land a z_m
    \]

- **Attacker’s Capability for Simultaneous Attacks:**
  - The resource limitation specifies that the attacker can inject false data to a maximum of \( TCZ \) measurements:
    \[
    \sum_{1 \leq i \leq l} c z_i \leq TCZ
    \]
  - An attacker can access or compromise a limited number of buses at a particular time. A bus is required to be accessed or compromised if a measurement residing at this bus is required to be altered:
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; c z_i \rightarrow c b_{lf_i}
    \]
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq i \leq l, \; c z_{l+i} \rightarrow c b_{lt_i}
    \]
    \[
    \forall 1 \leq j \leq b, \; c z_{2l+j} \rightarrow c b_j
    \]

- **Attacker’s Target:**
  - The attacker most often has a selected set of states for launching an attack. However, the attacker usually targets a specific subset of states.
