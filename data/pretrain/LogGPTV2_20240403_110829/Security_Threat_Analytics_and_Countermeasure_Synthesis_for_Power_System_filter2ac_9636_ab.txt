measurement zi is taken. Note that though m is often used to
represent the taken measurements, in this model m represents
the maximum number of potential measurements (i.e., 2l + b).
The attacker may not be able to alter a measurement due to
inaccessibility or existing security measures. We use az i to
denote whether measurement zi is accessible to the attacker.
We also use sz i to denote whether the measurement is secured.
C. Parameters for Modeling Topology Poisoning
The topology of a power grid represents the connectivity
among the grid buses. An attacker can inject false data in
the topology information sent by various circuit breakers and
switches in order to change the topology. Changes in the
topology that we assume in this work include: (i) exclusion of
a (closed) line from the topology (exclusion attack), and (ii)
inclusion of a open line in the topology (inclusion attack).
Here, we also assume that the adversary can coordinate a
topology error with other measurements to render the attack
undetected. Therefore, a UFDI attack can be performed by
leveraging the modiﬁed topology.
We assume that some of the lines in the topology are ﬁxed
(i.e., they are never opened), which form the core part of the
topology. We also allow the declaration of secure line statuses,
i.e., their topology is always faithfully represented in SE. In
order to model all these properties plus the topology change,
we use a list notations as shown in Table I. We use tl i to
denote whether line i is the true or real topology, while ﬂ i
and sl i denote whether the line is ﬁxed and the line status is
secure, respectively. In order to denote exclusion and inclusion
attack, we use el i and il i, respectively. Finally, ml i represents
whether line i is considered (i.e., mapped) in the topology.
D. Formalization of Change in State Estimation
The attack on state xj speciﬁes that the phase angle at bus j
is changed. This condition is formalized as follows:
∀1≤j≤n cx j → (Δθj (cid:5)= 0)
(5)
159159159
From Equation (3), it is obvious that a change of P L
i
is
required based on the changes in state xlf i (θlf i) and/or state
xlt i (θlt i). In the case of false data injection, P L
i , θlf i, and θlt i
are changed to P (cid:4)L
lt i, then Equation (3) turns
into the following:
lf i, and θ(cid:4)
i , θ(cid:4)
P (cid:4)L
i = ld i(θ(cid:4)
lf i
− θ(cid:4)
lt i )
ΔP L
The subtraction of Equation (3) from the above equation
represents whether there are changes in the measurements and
the states. The following is the resultant equation:
− Δθlt i)
i , Δθlf i
i = ld i(Δθlf i
i − P L
i = P (cid:4)L
lt i − θlt i. If Δθlf i
− θlf i, and
In this equation, ΔP L
(cid:5)= 0 (or Δθlt i (cid:5)= 0), then it is
Δθlt i = θ(cid:4)
obvious that state xlf i (or xlt i) is changed (i.e., attacked). The
above relation for line i holds only if the line is taken in the
topology. We formalize this constraint as follows:
= θ(cid:4)
lf i
∀1≤i≤l ml i → (ΔP L
i = ld i(Δθlf i
− Δθlt i))
(6)
If a line is not considered in the topology, then there should
be no requirement of false data injection to corresponding
measurements for launching UFDI attacks:
∀1≤i≤l ¬ml i → (ΔP L
E. Formalization of Topology Change
i = 0)
In the case of an inclusion attack, a line is considered in
the topology though the line is open in reality. Conversely, a
closed line in service is omitted in an exclusion attack. These
are formalized as follows:
∀1≤i≤l ml i → (tl i ∧ ¬el i) ∨ (¬tl i ∧ il i)
A line can be excluded from the topology if and only if the
line exists in the real or true topology and it is not a securely
ﬁxed line. This is formalized as follows:
∀1≤i≤l el i → tl i ∧ ¬ﬂ i ∧ ¬sl i

Conversely, measurement zi is altered only if it is taken and
corresponding power measurement is changed:
i,total (cid:5)= 0)
∀1≤i≤l cz i → mz i ∧ (ΔP L
∀1≤i≤l cz l+i → mz l+i ∧ (ΔP L
∀1≤j≤b cz 2l+j → mz 2l+j ∧ (ΔP B
i,total (cid:5)= 0)
j,total (cid:5)= 0)
(16)
G. Formalization of Attack Attributes
Attacker’s Knowledge If the admittance of a line is unknown,
then an adversary cannot determine the necessary changes
to make in the power ﬂow measurements of the line. We
formalize this condition as follows:
∀1≤i≤l cz i ∨ cz l+i → bd i
(17)
The following equation shows an example of specifying the
attacker’s knowledge about the admittances of the lines:
bd 1 ∧ bd 2 ∧ bd 3 ∧ ¬bd 4 ∧ ··· ∧ bd l
(18)
Attacker’s Accessibility. The attacker usually does not have
necessary physical or remote access to inject false data to all
the measurements. If a measurement is secured, then though
the attacker may have the ability to inject false data to the
measurement, the false data injection will not be successful.
Hence, the attacker will only be able to change measurement
zi in order to attack, if the following condition holds:
∀1≤i≤m cz i → az i ∧ ¬sz i
Whether a measurement is secured or not as well as whether
a measurement is accessible to the attacker or not are speciﬁed,
for example, as follows:
¬sz 1 ∧ sz 2 ∧ ¬sz 3 ∧ ¬sz 4 ∧ ··· ∧ sz m
az 1 ∧ ¬az 2 ∧ az 3 ∧ ¬az 4 ∧ ··· ∧ az m
(21)
Attacker’s Capability for Simultaneous Attacks. The re-
source limitation speciﬁes that, at a particular time, the attacker
can inject false data to TCZ number of measurements, at the
maximum:
(cid:6)
cz i ≤ TCZ
1≤i≤l
Due to limited resources, an attacker can only access or
compromise a limited number of buses at a particular time. A
bus is required to be accessed or compromised if a measure-
ment residing at this bus is required to be altered. Therefore:
∀1≤i≤l cz i → cblf i
∀1≤i≤l cz l+i → cblt i
∀1≤j≤b cz 2l+j → cbj
(19)
(20)
(22)
(23)
(24)
Similarly, a line can be included in the topology if the
following condition holds:
∀1≤i≤l
il i → ¬tl i ∧ ¬sl i
(10)
Note that for a topology error to remain undetected, it is
necessary to alter certain measurements in necessary amounts.
If a closed line is excluded from the topology, the correspond-
ing line power ﬂow measurement must be zero. As the states
remain the same after the topology change, the correspond-
ing connected buses’ power consumption measurements are
adjusted accordingly. On the other hand, when a open line is
included in the topology, there should be a non-zero line power
ﬂow according to the phase difference between the connected
buses. Let Δ ¯P L
i be the change amount in the power ﬂow
measurement of line i in the case of a topology change. Then,
the following constraints hold:
∀1≤i≤l el i → (Δ ¯P L
il i → (Δ ¯P L
∀1≤i≤l
i = −P L
i )
i = P L
i )
(11)
(12)
If no exclusion or inclusion attack is done on line i, then
Δ ¯P L
i = 0. Now, if line power ﬂow measurement i (or l + i)
needs to change, according to Equations (11) and (12), we
need to know P L
i already
exists (i.e., the actual measurement) and the attacker must have
the access to it. In the case of an exclusion attack, P L
i needs to
be estimated based on the difference between the states (θjs)
of the connecting buses.
i . In the case of exclusion attack, P L
F. Formalization of False Data Injection to Measurements
Here, we compute and formalize necessary changes required
on the measurement to coordinate the attack. The change for
a power ﬂow measurement is the summation of individual
changes that are required for topology changes and state
changes. If ΔP L
i,total be the total change required on the
line i’s power ﬂow, then:
∀1≤i≤l ΔP L
i,total = ΔP L
i + Δ ¯P L
(13)
i
According to Equation (4), the change in the measurement
of the power consumption (ΔP B
j,total) at a bus depends on
the total changes done in the power ﬂow measurements of the
lines incident to this bus. Therefore,
∀1≤j≤b ΔP B

i,total (14)
j,total =

When ΔP L
i,total (cid:5)= 0, then taken measurements correspond-
ing to line i (i.e., mz i and mz l+i) are required to be altered.
Similarly, when ΔP B
the power consumption
measurement at bus j needs to be changed:
∀1≤i≤l(ΔP L
∀1≤j≤b (ΔP B
i,total (cid:5)= 0) → (mz i → cz i) ∧ (mz l+i → cz l+i)
