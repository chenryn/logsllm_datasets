accurate identiﬁcation
In the above, we used a trace 1, 000 seconds in length con-
taining 50, 000 observations. We next investigate the prob-
ing duration required to obtain an accurate identiﬁcation.
We randomly choose a segment from the 1000-second trace
as the probing sequence to identify if a dominant congested
link exists. Following that, we check if the identiﬁcation is
correct or not. In the model, the number of delay symbols
M is chosen to be 5 and the number of hidden states N is
1. We repeat the process 400 times and obtain the fraction
of correct identiﬁcations.
In cases where a strongly dominant congested link exists,
the probing duration of several tens of seconds suﬃces to
achieve correct identiﬁcation. Fig. 10(a) plots the correct
fraction versus the probing duration for the setting with a
weakly dominant congested link described in detail in Sec-
tion 5.1.2. We observe that a probing duration of 80 seconds
suﬃces to correctly identify the existence of a dominant con-
gested link. Fig. 10(b) depicts the correct fraction versus the
probing duration for the setting with no dominant congested
link described in detail in Section 5.1.3. The correct fraction
is very close to 1 with a probing duration of 250 seconds.
5.2 Internet experiments
We next describe validation results using Internet exper-
iments over three paths. In the ﬁrst path, the source is at
University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass) and the des-
tination is at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ),
Brazil. In the second and third paths, the source is at a res-
ident house in Amherst, Massachusetts and the destinations
are at UMass and University of Southern California (USC)
respectively. The resident house uses a cable modem for
Internet connection.
It is physically very close to UMass
and far from USC. We use Linux-based machines for all the
experiments.
In each experiment, we run tcpdump [25] to capture the
timestamps of the probes at the source and the destination
to obtain one-way delay. We then use the method proposed
in [26] to remove clock oﬀset and skew. Each experiment
lasts for one hour. For each experiment, we select a station-
ary probing sequence of 20 minutes for model-based identi-
ﬁcation. The minimum end-end delay in the entire hour is
used as D0. The queuing delays are discretized into 5 delay
symbols, that is, M = 5. We vary the number of hidden

states N from 1 to 4. At the end, we investigate the eﬀect
of probing duration, the choice of M and D0 on the identi-
ﬁcation results. For all the experiments, the null hypothesis
is that there exists a weakly dominant congested link with
θ = 0.05 and φ = 0.05.
It is very diﬃcult to validate the results from the Inter-
net experiments since we do not have access to the internal
routers to measure per-hop delay and loss for each probe.
We therefore use some existing measurement tools. We use
pathchar [15] to estimate link bandwidth along a path. Dur-
ing the experiments, we ran ping to each internal router to
obtain a crude estimate of the loss rate from the source to
the internal routers.
5.2.1 UMass to Brazil
For the several experiments from UMass to UFRJ, the
identiﬁcation procedure accepts the hypothesis that a dom-
inant congested link exists along the path. This is consis-
tent with the observations from the network operators in
UFRJ that the UFRJ gateway was lossy at the time we ran
the experiments. Results from pathchar indicate that the
link from UFRJ gateway has the lowest bandwidth along
the path, which is consistent with our identiﬁcation. It is
worth mentioning that the link bandwidth estimates from
pathchar alone can not be used as a reliable basis for dom-
inant congested link identiﬁcation. Furthermore, it takes
several hours when running pathchar on this path while only
minutes of probes are suﬃcient to identify whether a domi-
nant congested link exists, a point we will return to in Sec-
tion 5.2.3. We next describe one experiment in detail.
This experiment started at 3:21pm on Feb. 24, 2003 with
a probing interval of 20 ms. The loss rate of this probing
sequence is 0.2%. Fig. 11 shows the PMF of the virtual
queuing delays for models with N = 1, 2, 3. The distribu-
tions from diﬀerent models are very similar. For θ = 0.01
and φ = 0.01, D = 1 is the minimum delay such that
FW (D) > θ. Since FW (2D) = FW (2) > (1−θ)(1−φ) ≈ 0.98,
by Test 2, we accept the hypothesis that there is a weakly
dominant congested link with θ = 0.01 and φ = 0.01. Of
course, we accept the hypothesis that there is a weakly dom-
inant congested link with higher values of θ and φ.
5.2.2 Resident house as the source
We next describe validation results for the second and
third paths, both using the resident house as the source.

Figure 13: The virtual queuing delay distribution
for an experiment from the resident house to USC.
The outgoing bandwidth of the cable modem in the resident
house is around 250 Kbps. The path from the resident house
to UMass contains 12 hops, over one commercial network.
The path from the resident house to USC contains 28 hops,
over commercial networks administrated by three ISPs. We
next describe one experiment for each path in detail.
The experiment from the resident house to UMass started
at 11:40pm on Feb. 20, 2003 with a probing interval of 20
ms. The average loss rate is 5.5%. Fig. 12 shows the vir-
tual queuing delay distributions from diﬀerent models. The
distribution using N = 1 diﬀers slightly from those using
N ≥ 2. For θ = 0.05 and φ = 0.05, D = 2 is the minimum
delay such that FW (D) > θ. Since FW (2D) = FW (4) >
(1 − θ)(1 − φ) ≈ 0.90, by Test 2, the distribution does not
contradict the hypothesis that there exists a weakly domi-
nant congested link with θ = 0.05 and φ = 0.05. Results
from pathchar indicate that the link from the UMass gate-
way has much lower bandwidth than other links (except the
one from the resident house), which is consistent with our
identiﬁcation.
The experiment from the resident house to USC started
at 11:16am on Feb. 22, 2003 with a probing interval of 20
ms. The average loss rate is 4%. Fig. 13 shows the virtual
queuing delay distribution for diﬀerent models. We observe
that the distribution when N = 1 diﬀers from others, which
indicates that N = 1 is not suﬃcient for this setting. When
using θ = 0.1 and φ = 0.1, D = 1 is the minimum delay such
that FW (D) > θ. However, FW (2D) = FW (2) < (1− θ)(1−
φ) = 0.81. By Test 2, we conclude that there is no weakly
dominant congested link with θ = 0.1 and φ = 0.1. Of
course, there is no weakly dominant congested link for lower
values of θ and φ. Results from pathchar show two low-
bandwidth links along the path (except the one from the
resident house), which is consistent with our identiﬁcation.
5.2.3 The effect of the probing duration and the choice
of M and D0
We next investigate the eﬀect of the probing duration and
the choice of M and D0 on the identiﬁcation results. We use
the two experiments from the resident house since the loss
rate from UMass to UFRJ is too low. For each experiment,
we randomly choose a segment from the 20-minute trace as
a probing sequence to identify if there exists a weakly dom-
inant congested link with θ = φ = 0.05 using the model-
based approach. Afterwards, we check if the identiﬁcation
from the segment is consistent with that from the 20-minute
trace. In the model, the number of delay symbols M is 5,
7 or 9 and the number of hidden states N is 1. We repeat
the process 400 times and obtain the fraction of consistent
identiﬁcations. For each probing sequence, we examine two
cases: using the minimum end-end delay in the probing se-
quence and and that in the entire hour as D0. We believe
the minimum end-end delay in one hour (over 105 probes)
is very close to the real D0. We therefore refer to the ﬁrst
case as D0 unknown and the second case as D0 known.
Fig. 14(a) and (b) depict the consistency fraction versus
the probing duration for the two experiments. For M = 5,
both the cases D0 known and unknown are shown in the
ﬁgure. For both experiments, the results for D0 known and
unknown are very close, especially for relatively long prob-
ing durations. This demonstrates that the approximation
by using the minimum end-end delay in a probing sequence
as D0 does not aﬀect the identiﬁcation results for these two
settings. We also observe in Fig. 14 that a probing dura-
tion on the order of minutes is suﬃcient to achieve a high
consistency fraction in both experiments for M = 5, 7, or 9.
5.3 Summary results
We summarize the key results from the ns simulation and
Internet experiments as follows:
• The virtual queuing delay distributions inferred with
diﬀerent number of hidden states, N , are similar. N =
2 is suﬃcient for all the settings we examined. The
distribution when N = 1 is very close to those when
N ≥ 2 in most cases. The number of delay symbols M
between 5 and 9 is suﬃcient.
• The probing duration required for a correct identiﬁca-
tion needs to be on the order of minutes for the various
settings we studied. The inaccuracy caused by using
the minimum end-end delay to approximate D0 is neg-
ligible when the probing duration is longer than several
minutes.
• The computational requirements of the inference pro-
cedure are small (seconds) since the procedure only
requires small M, N and short probing duration.
• The estimates of the maximum queuing delays at the
weakly dominant congested link from our model-based
approach are more accurate than those from the loss
pair approach.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we study a speciﬁc end-end path charac-
teristic, namely, whether a dominant congested link exists
along a path. We propose two simple hypothesis tests for
identifying this characteristic and develop a model-based
approach for identiﬁcation from one-way end-end measure-
ments. Our validation in ns simulation and Internet exper-
iments shows that the model-based approach requires only
minutes of probing for accurate identiﬁcation. As future
work, we are pursuing in several directions: (i) conduct con-
trolled test-bed experiments and more/richer Internet ex-
periments for validation; (ii) study how to pinpoint the dom-
inant congested link after identifying a dominant congested
link exists.
