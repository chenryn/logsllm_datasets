When trying to load a package I built, my REPL gets filled up with an absurd
number of messages like this:
    WARNING: Method definition Any(Integer, Static.StaticInt{U}) where {U} in module ArrayInterface at /home/lime/.julia/packages/ArrayInterface/CYf5x/src/ranges.jl:226 overwritten on the same line (check for duplicate calls to `include`).
      ** incremental compilation may be fatally broken for this module **
I definitely don't have any duplicate calls to include; moreover, the error
messages only appear when using v1.7, while 1.6.1 works perfectly fine. I'm
using this version.
