When attempting to load a package I have developed, my REPL is inundated with an excessive number of warning messages, such as the following:

```
WARNING: Method definition Any(Integer, Static.StaticInt{U}) where {U} in module ArrayInterface at /home/lime/.julia/packages/ArrayInterface/CYf5x/src/ranges.jl:226 overwritten on the same line (check for duplicate calls to `include`).
  ** incremental compilation may be fatally broken for this module **
```

I have verified that there are no duplicate calls to `include`. Additionally, these error messages only appear when using Julia version 1.7; version 1.6.1 works perfectly fine. I am currently using Julia version 1.7.

This revised version clarifies the issue and provides a more structured and professional tone.
