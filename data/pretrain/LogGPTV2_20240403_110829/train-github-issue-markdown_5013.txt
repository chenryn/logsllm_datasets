Symfony version | 2.8.15  
Hi,  
I'm upgrading from Symfony 2.3 to 2.8 and ran into an issue.  
I'm using an entity which get some properties let's see it as follow
    class MyEntity
    {
        private $myProperty;
    }
I'm missing annotations as this code it is only for demonstration purpose, but
it is a symfony entity.  
I got a controller action which list MyEntity's entites and I got a filter
system to show all my entites or only those with `$myProperty` corresponding
to what I want.  
We can imagine the controller action as follow:
    function listAction(Request $request)
    {
        $form = $this
            ->createForm(MyEntityFormType::class, [], ['method' => $request->getMethod()])
            ->handleRequest($request)
        ;
    }
In
`symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/HttpFoundation/HttpFoundationRequestHandler::handleRequest()`
function there is in line 109 this verification:
    // Don't auto-submit the form unless at least one field is present.
    if ('' === $name && count(array_intersect_key($data, $form->all())) createForm(MyEntityFormType::class, [], ['method' => $request->getMethod()])
        ->handleRequest($request)
    ;
    // $form->handleRequest() doesn't submit request with no data
    // If the form doesn't get errors and the request doesn't get
    // data we manually call $form->submit() w/ computed data
    if (!$form->isSubmitted() && (0 === count($form->getErrors(true))) && $form->isEmpty()) {
        $requestData = $request->request->all();
        $queryData = $request->query->all();
        $form->submit(array_merge($defaultValue, $queryData, $requestData));
    }
Is there a best practice to handle this case ?  
Is this a case which is not supposed to be ?
