User: How to avoid DNS problems in cloud computing environment?
Assistant: 1. Multiple DNS sources: Using multiple DNS sources can reduce the impact of DNS server failure on the system. Multiple DNS service providers can be selected for better reliability. 2. Cache management: Proper cache management reduces the number of DNS queries, thereby reducing potential DNS problems. Caching relieves pressure on DNS servers and also provides the normal operation necessary to continue normal operation when DNS queries fail due to a DNS server failure. 3. Monitoring and diagnostic tools: monitoring the running status of the DNS resolution server can detect and deal with DNS problems in time. Performing a DNS query test with a diagnostic tool to see DNS resolution performance can also help avoid potential DNS problems. 4. Reverse DNS settings: Correctly setting reverse DNS records will help avoid DNS reverse query failures, thereby improving system reliability. 5. Prevent DNS batch query: You should use the method of restricting DNS query to avoid attempting to query DNS servers in a large number in a short period of time. 6. DNS security technology: Using DNS security technology, such as DNSSEC, will help prevent DNS hijacking and avoid potential security problems caused by DNS hijacking.
