User: I am very very new in Python and I have a doubt.
If I write a program in a text editor (such as Nodepad++), then can I execute it from the Python shell (the one that begin with >>)? What command have I to launch to execute my Python program?
Tnx
Andrea
Assistant: In the view of mine:
you wrote a program:
test.py
print 'test file'
and you turn to the windows cmd:
you excuted python,and you got this

then you can just simply:



os.system('python test.py')
