Question: If an application developer argues that using UDP would significantly reduce the reliability of their application, which of the following aspects of UDP would best counter that argument?
"A": "UDP's use of port numbers allows for direct communication between specific processes, which can enhance reliability.",
"B": "The presence of a checksum in the UDP header can detect corrupted packets, thus ensuring some level of reliability.",
"C": "UDP's lack of connection establishment reduces communication overhead, which has no impact on reliability.",
"D": "The best-effort delivery nature of UDP inherently means that reliability is not a primary concern of the protocol."
Answer: B
