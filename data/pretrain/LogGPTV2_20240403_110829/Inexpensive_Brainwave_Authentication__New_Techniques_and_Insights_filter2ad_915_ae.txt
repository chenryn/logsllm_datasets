Table 5: Comparison of N400:Faces brainwave authentication against passwords and ﬁngerprint using the framework by Bonneau
et al. [14]. We use “•” to indicate that the scheme provides the beneﬁt; and “◦”to denote that the beneﬁt is somewhat provided.
to be robust as ERPs are less sensitive to background noise
than continuous EEGs and, even if latency/amplitude might
vary with external factors like stress, tiredness, etc. [19], ERPs
reﬂect morphological components (e.g., skull thickness) that
are more stable [5, 63]. Additional experiments in real-life
conditions should be conducted to validate this hypothesis. In
our experiments, we observed a high variability in the perfor-
mance of different brainwave authentication tasks. We specu-
late that the number and quality of registered samples impacts
the results, but further research is required to understand the
factors inducing this variability and how to reduce their effect.
It would be also valuable to investigate the scalability of the
results to even larger populations.
With regard to usability, our user study is based on a
sample of the population that includes generally young and
technically-savvy users Bigger and diverse sets of users would
yield a more comprehensive picture of the usability issues in
brainwave authentication systems. We described the system
to our participants embedding it in a realistic use case: we
told them that they would have to watch one task out of the set
of tasks in the experiment once a day, and this would replace
the need to type passwords for their applications. With this
description, a perfect implementation is assumed. The main
methodological limitation is that we rely on self-reported
qualitative feedback about intended future behavior based
on participants perception of the described system, which
might not accurately reﬂect reality [39]. With these charac-
teristics, our goal is to describe problems that could hinder
the adoption of brainwave-based authentication to consider
when designing actual prototypes or experiments, but we do
not claim any generalizable ﬁndings. Nonetheless, to achieve
ecological validity, we need to test and evaluate the actual
usability of authentication prototypes in real scenarios.
8 Conclusion
We contribute to the literature on behavioral biometrics with
the ﬁrst comparative study on the usability and performance
of brainwave authentication protocols based on endogenous
Event Related Potentials using consumer-grade EEG readers.
Our results show the feasibility of authentication by recording
brain activity while users look to short sequences of visual
stimuli (images or words). With regard to perceived usabil-
ity, users are positive about this type of systems but call for
simpler headsets and fast authentication times. Considering
participants feedback, we highlight the need to conduct ex-
tensive privacy research before brainwave-based applications
become mainstream. When contextualizing our results, we
found out that comparability with other works is hampered
by differences in experimental conditions and performance
reporting schemes, but also because the sample sizes used in
the literature are very small (the majority ≤10 ). We therefore
contribute our dataset to improve the availability of samples
and provide a source for common benchmarking. To bridge
the comparability gap, the authentication community should
strive to establish a consistent approach for communicating
performance metrics.
