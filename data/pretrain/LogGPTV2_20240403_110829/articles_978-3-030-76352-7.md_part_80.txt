1 Introduction
In the era of recent technologies, IoT (Internet of Things) is playing a huge
role in digital world. In 2016 the overall used IoT devices is almost 9 million
and by in the year of 2025 the count of IoT device will be increased up to
trillion annually [3]. Since the tremendous increase in short span of time leads
IoT vendors to concentrate less on security for IoT devices rather that they
concentrate well on developing the IoT devices across various fields such as
medical, defense, Industry etc. Attackers makes use of this situation to pollute
thesmartnessoftheIoTdevice.Onthelastdecades,therearemanyIoTdevices
were affected by malwares at very high speed. Out of these malwares, most of
them are botnets such as brickerbot, Mirai, hajime, Leet etc., [20] and few of
them are worms and trojan such as Hijame and Darlloz. Those IoT Botnets are
speciallydesignedtolaunchfloodofDDoSattackfromtheIoTdevicestomany
of the connected network and it is a great risk to stop those attack [4]. Some

it cannot be recovered to earlier stage. Additionally, these malwares capable of
launching many kinds of attacks like keylogging, Information Theft, DoS, OS
Fingerprinting and Service scan. The traditional ways to mitigate those kind of
malwaresaresignaturedetection,honeypotdetectionandbehaviouroranomaly
based detection. But these kind of approach are not comfortable to the IoT
devices because of its resource constraint nature. Some of the researchers have
proposed their work to defend against DDoS attack in IoT platform using SDN
andthisapproachfacessomehurdlesinimplementationstage.Recentlymanyof
the researchers have contribute their work towards enhancement of security for
IoT devices using machine learning [2] and deep learning architectures such as
LSTM, RNN, FNN, SNN, ANN etc. In this regard, the big challenge is getting
real time network traffic of the IoT device. The main contribution of this work
is summarized below
1. Class imbalance problem is identified in the dataset of IoT’s network traffic.
2. Bothoversamplingandundersamplingtechniquehasbeencarriedouttobal-
ance the IoT dataset.
3. Machine learning techniques such as SVM, Decision tree (j48) and Na¨ıve
Bayes as well as deep learning techniques were used to classify the normal
and attack traffic generated by the IoT devices.

framework for IoT devices in network layer designed using artificial intelligence
techniques such as machine learning and deep learning techniques has been dis-

the designed model. Due to the non-availability of real time IoT network traf-
fic, most of the below listed existing work is liable on traditional dataset like
NSL-KDD, KDD CUP 99 and UNSW-15. Recently new real time IoT traffic
is introduced such as N-BaIoT (2017) and BoT IoT (2018) for further realistic
research in this field.

by combining both CNN and RNN. This work is especially for monitoring and
managing the network activity of IoT devices through its traffic itself.

Hismodelisdeployedintwoparti.e.onemoduleinIoTcloudandanotheronein
sensor platform. The malware detecting engine is designed using Autoencoders
neural network. In the case of IoT security, traditional datasets may not be
suitable because it does not hold any recent attacks happens in IoT platform to
train and test the proposed model whereas N-BaIoT and BoTIoT dataset holds
the different types of real IoT attacks. At the end of this survey, it can conclude
that only few work is tested on these two real time dataset.
3 Motivation of the Work
TheBoT-IoTdatasetcomprisesofmaximumattackinstanceandminimumnor-
mal instance, this case can increase the accuracy towards detecting the traffic
of malware attack rather than detecting the normal traffic as normal. There
is a chance of detecting normal instance as abnormal and it will leads to the
IoT device in an idle state without receiving any authorized command from its
server. Moreover minority class will not be detected and it does not reflect to
the accuracy of the classifier. This kind of problem is said to be class imbalance
problem [13].
4 Methods and Materials
4.1 Dataset Description
The BoT-IoT dataset [11] generated under the IoT environment of Cyber range
lab of UNSW Canberra Cyber. The network traffic dataset is broadly classified
into two types such as normal and attack. The attack instances comprises of
four types of attack namely DDoS, DoS, Theft and Keylogging. This type of
attackagainhasbeendividedintosubcategorysuchasDDoSTCP,DDoSUDP,
DDoS HTTP, DoS HTTP, DoS UDP, DoS TCP, OS Fingerprint, service scan,
Data exfiltration and Key logging. Overall dataset has 9543 normal instances
and 73360900 abnormal instances.
4.2 Correlation Based Feature Selection
Correlation based method is used to measure the linear dependence among the
set of existing feature set. This method allocates values between −1 to +1 for
eachfeatures.Thisvalueindicatesthesignificanceandtypeofcorrelationamong
feature set. The features having low correlation is considered to be more signifi-
cance.
4.3 Support Vector Machine
SVM is a most commonly used learning algorithm for classification. This algo-
rithmplotsitsn-featuresinn-dimensionalspace.Thenthealgorithmwillcreate
few hyper plane which cuts the data points into two classes. Among the few
hyper plane one of the best plane is selected on the basis of classification.

4.4 Decision Tree (j48)
Decision tree is a branch like structure algorithm. Here each attribute acts as a
node and the relationship between the nodes acts as branches. Each branches
are divided based on some decision or condition. This algorithm works well for
the classification task. In this case, this algorithm is utilized here to classify
malicious clusters from the normal clusters.
4.5 Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes algorithm works based on the Bayes theorem. It states that any
two features classified is independent of each other. This classifier is well suited
for high dimensional dataset. This algorithm performs the classification based
on its previous occurrence and it is termed as prior probability.
4.6 Deep Neural Network
In this work, a lightweight deep learning architecture, namely the deep neural
network (DNN), is used to allow the deep intrusion detection system to capture
theIoTbotnetasitevolvesoverthenetwork.SincetheIoTnetworkissaidtobe

with only three hidden layers, and the number of iteration/epoch is 3. A neural
network stands as a basement for deep learning techniques because it works like
the neurons of the human brain. In this regard, the deep neural network is one

5.1 Sampling Phase
In this phase, class imbalance problem in the dataset has been handled without
disturbing the significance of the dataset. Sampling technique is classified into
two ways such as oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling technique is
used to increase number of instance of the minority class in the dataset. Under-
sampling technique is quite opposite to oversampling whereas it decreases the
