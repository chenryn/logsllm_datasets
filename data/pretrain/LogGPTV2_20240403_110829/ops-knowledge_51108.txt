User: Since the last version is 1.9, released on 2011, but the documentation only covers from 1.0 to 1.5. Also Windows Installers aren't available. It seems that there's poor activity around the framework, also in the mailing list and IRC channel.
Edited the title because of the confusions. Thanks to everyone for the replies.
Assistant: No, the project has not been deprecated.
Like many open source software projects there is a natural cycle in interest and activity, with the only difference being the speed in which the cycle progresses.
Deprecation is an explicit choice by the maintainers; no such choice has been made. It's just that most interest in the project has moved on elsewhere.
