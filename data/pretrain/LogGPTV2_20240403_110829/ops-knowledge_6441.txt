User: I need major help getting started! I managed to create a new project, and add python.exe as the interpreter. But when the project is created it's blank. How do I start programming? Ugh.
Assistant: Create PyDev project
Add "Source Folder" under the project
Add "Modules" to the "Source Folder"
Get coding :-)
