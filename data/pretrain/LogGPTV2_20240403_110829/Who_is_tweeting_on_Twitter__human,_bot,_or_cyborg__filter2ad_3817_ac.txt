the Twitter website. The rest of top devices are mobile applica-
tions (Tweetie, UberTwitter, Mobile web, Txt, TwitterBerry ) and
desktop clients (TweetDeck, Echofon and Seesmic).
In general,
tweeting via such devices requires human participation. In contrast,
the top tools used by bots are mainly auto piloted, and 42.39% of
bot tweets are generated via unregistered API-based tools. Bots
can abuse APIs to do almost everything they want on Twitter, like
targeting users with keywords, following users, unfollowing those
who do not follow back, or posting prepared tweets. Twitterfeed,
RSS2Twitter, and Proxifeed are RSS feed widgets that automati-
cally pipeline information (usually in the format of the page title
followed by the URL) to Twitter via RSS feeds. Twitter Tools and
Twitme for WordPress are popular WordPress plug-ins that inte-
grate blog updates to Twitter. Assetize is an advertising syndicator
mainly targeting at Twitter, and twitRobot is a bot tool that au-
tomatically follows other users and posts tweets. All these tools
only require minimum human participation (like importing Twitter
account information, or setting RSS feeds and update frequency),
and thus indicate great automation.
Overall, humans tend to tweet manually and bots are more likely
to use auto piloted tools. Cyborgs employ the typical human and
bot tools. The cyborg group includes many human users who ac-
cess their Twitter accounts from time to time. For most of the time
when they are absent, they leave their accounts to auto piloted tools
for management.
Q5. Do bots include more external URLs than humans? In our
measurement, we ﬁnd out that, most bots tend to include URLs
in tweets to redirect visitors to external web pages. For example,
spam bots are created to spread unsolicited commercial informa-
tion. Their topics are similar to those in email spam, including
online marketing and afﬁliate programs, working at home, sell-
ing fake luxury brands or pharmaceutical products7. However, the
tweet size is up to 140 characters, which is rather limited for spam-
mers to express enough text information to allure users. Basically,
a spam tweet contains an appealing title followed by an external
URL. Figure 7 shows the external URL ratios (namely, the num-
ber of external URLs included in tweets over the number of tweets
posted by an account) for the three categories, among which the
URL ratio of bot is highest. Some tweets by bots even have more
than one URL8. The URL ratio of cyborg is very close to the bot’s
level. A large number of cyborgs integrate RSS feeds and blog
updates, which take the style of webpage titles followed by page
links. The URL ratio of human is much lower, on average it is only
29%. When a human tweets what is he doing or what is happen-
ing around him, he mainly uses text and does not often link to web
pages.
Q6. Are users aware of privacy and identity protection on Twit-
ter? Twitter provides a protected option to protect user privacy.
If it is set as true, the user’s homepage is only visible to his friends.
However, the option is set as false by default.
In our dataset of
over 500,000 users, only 4.9% of them are protected users. Twit-
ter also veriﬁes some accounts to authenticate users’ real identities.
More and more celebrities and famous organizations have applied
for veriﬁed accounts. For example, Bill Gates has his veriﬁed Twit-
ter account at http://twitter.com/billgates. However,
in our dataset, only 1.8% of users have veriﬁed accounts.
7A new topic is attracting more followers on Twitter. It follows
the style of pyramid sales by asking newly joined users to follow
existing users in the spam network.
8Many such accounts belong to a type of bot that always appends
a spam link to tweets it re-tweets.

4. CLASSIFICATION
This section describes our automated system for classiﬁcation of
Twitter users. The system classiﬁes Twitter users into three cat-
egories: human, bot, and cyborg. The system consists of several
components: the entropy component, the machine learning com-
ponent, the account properties component, and the decision maker.
The high-level design of our Twitter user classiﬁcation system is
shown in Figure 8. The entropy component uses corrected condi-
tional entropy to detect periodic or regular timing, which is a sign
of automation. The machine learning component uses a variant of
Bayesian classiﬁcation to detect text patterns of known spam on
Twitter. The account properties component uses account-related
properties to catch bot deviation from the normal human distribu-
tion. Lastly, the decision maker uses LDA to analyze the features
identiﬁed by the other three components and makes a decision: hu-
man, cyborg, or bot.
4.1 Entropy Component
The entropy component detects periodic or regular timing of the
messages posted by a Twitter user. On one hand, if the entropy or
corrected conditional entropy is low for the inter-tweet delays, it
indicates periodic or regular behavior, a sign of automation. More
speciﬁcally, some of the messages are posted via automation, i.e.,
the user may be a potential bot or cyborg. On the other hand, a high
entropy indicates irregularity, a sign of human participation.
4.1.1 Entropy Measures
The entropy rate is a measure of the complexity of a process [8].
The behavior of bots is often less complex than that of humans
[12,22], which can be measured by entropy rate. A low entropy rate
indicates a regular process, whereas a high entropy rate indicates
a random process. A medium entropy rate indicates a complex
process, i.e., a mix of order and disorder [20].
The entropy rate is deﬁned as either the average entropy per ran-
dom variable for an inﬁnite sequence or as the conditional entropy
of an inﬁnite sequence. Thus, as real datasets are ﬁnite, the con-
