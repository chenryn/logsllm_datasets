If there are large values in the observation matrix, the vq.kmeans method
fails with the following error:
(Pdb) centroids, distortion = vq.kmeans(erow, centroids, iter=1)  
*** UnboundLocalError: local variable 'best_book' referenced before assignment
This can be fixed by applying the attached patch.
