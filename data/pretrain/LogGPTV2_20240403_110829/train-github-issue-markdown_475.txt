## Expected Behavior
Grow transition honors the enter/leave durations propagated from the Dialog
component.
## Current Behavior
`Dialog` accepts enter and leaveTransitionDuration props but the `Grow`
transition only accepts the transitionDuration prop. This effectively ignores
the props given to the Dialog.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
https://codesandbox.io/s/l476j33mjq
  1. Click 'Show dialog'
  2. Observe that react warning in console
## Context
One can use props directly on a Grow transition (and in fact the defaults are
great in my case) so not a super important bug but it might rear it's head in
other places.
