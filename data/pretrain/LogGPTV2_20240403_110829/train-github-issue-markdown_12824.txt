It would be great if we can allow user to adjust position of the "debug-
actions-widget" according to their choice.  
What we will get out of it:
  1. We have one open issue (# 4332) where user not able to see the linter error message as it is covered by debug-actions-widget .
  2. When user is working with small screen size (with chrome debugger tool window opened), some time file name is covered by debug-actions-widget.

Expected:
  1. Make the "debug-actions-widget" position configurable (Horizontal, vertical etc.)
  2. Allow user to adjust position by dragging.
