## Abstract

Live video streaming now accounts for over 34.97% of Internet traffic. Traditional distribution architectures for live video heavily rely on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to meet stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. However, CDN-based solutions are costly to operate. Consequently, hybrid systems that complement CDNs with WebRTC have emerged. WebRTC enables direct peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between browsers, allowing viewer-to-viewer (V2V) video chunk exchanges. In this work, we analyze an operational hybrid live video system using per-exchange statistics. We present a high-level overview of the system's performance, focusing on the fraction of V2V traffic. Our analysis reveals that a small fraction of users significantly influences overall performance. By profiling individual client upload and download performance, we identify that clients responsible for chunk losses often have poor uplink access. We propose a strategy where clients evaluate their uplink capacity and refrain from sending data if their performance is too low. This approach reduces the chunk loss rate by nearly half, with minimal impact on V2V traffic.

## 1. Introduction

By 2022, global video traffic on the Internet is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 29%, accounting for 82% of all IP traffic [2]. Typically, video content is delivered via Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which face significant pressure to ensure a good Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. The high cost of CDN operations has led to the development of hybrid CDN/V2V (viewer-to-viewer) architectures. These systems allow data sharing between viewers while maintaining QoE.

This paper focuses on a commercial hybrid V2V-CDN system that provides live video streaming channels. Each channel is encoded in different quality levels, and the library acts as a proxy for fetching video chunks. The library attempts to fetch chunks from other viewers and reverts to the CDN if the chunk is not received in time. The operation is transparent to the player, which independently decides the quality level based on network conditions and buffer occupancy.

Our hybrid V2V-CDN architecture uses WebRTC for direct browser communication and a central manager (Fig. 1). The library is downloaded when the user accesses the TV channel's web page. It uses the ICE protocol along with STUN and TURN to find its public IP address and port. The library then contacts the central manager using SDP to provide its unique ID, ICE data, and playing quality. The manager sends a list of viewers watching the same content at the same quality level, forming a swarm. The maximum swarm size is 10, offering a balance between diversity and maintenance effort.

When the video player requests a new chunk, the library selects the source, either another viewer or a CDN server. Viewers can download data from other viewers within a specified time period, typically the size of one video chunk (6 seconds in our case). There is no global synchronization mechanism, but new clients always request the latest available chunk from the manifest file. Users can roll back up to 5 hours, and the library maintains a history of the last 30 chunks (about 3 minutes).

Hybrid V2V-CDN systems offer a cost-effective alternative to pure CDN architectures, but they must balance video quality and a high fraction of V2V-delivered content. This paper presents detailed statistics from a 3-day period with over 34,000 clients and 6 TB of data exchanged. We use three metrics: V2V Efficiency, Throughput, and Chunk Loss Rate (CLR) to evaluate the system's efficiency. We demonstrate that the root cause of high CLR lies in the uplink of some clients and propose a mitigation strategy that reduces the CLR by almost 50% with minimal impact on V2V traffic.

## 2. State of the Art

Several studies have shown that WebRTC can be successfully used for live video streaming [5, 6]. The V2V protocol in this work relies on a mesh architecture to connect viewers [4]. The V2V content delivery protocol applies a proactive approach, disseminating information as soon as a single viewer downloads it. Large-scale measurement studies on live video systems, such as [7], have demonstrated that the current Internet infrastructure can support large P2P networks for live video distribution. These studies analyzed the uploading and downloading bitrates of peers and found significant fluctuations. The popularity of content affects the number of viewers and the ease of finding other viewers. In [8], the authors focused on the problems caused by P2P traffic to ISP networks, which is addressed in hybrid V2V-CDN architectures through a central manager that can apply strategies like grouping viewers in the same ISP or geographic location.

## 3. Overall Channel Profiling

The TV channel we profile is a popular Moroccan channel serviced by our hybrid V2V-CDN system, offering regular programs and extraordinary events like football matches. Almost 50% of the clients are in Morocco, with France (15%) and other countries (Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Canada, United States, Germany, Belgium) making up about 28% of the viewers. Watching the channel is free and accessible via any web browser. On average, 60% of users use mobile devices, and 40% use fixed devices.

### 3.1 Data Set

Our reference data set aggregates three days of data from October 2020. Two days have no special events, while the third day features a significant event. The channel can be watched at three quality levels: 3.5 Mb/s, 7 Mb/s, and 10 Mb/s. Over these three days, we collected information on 34,816 client sessions. On a standard day, the total data downloaded varies between 1.5 and 2 TB, while during big events, it ranges from 6 to 6.5 TB. The average aggregate bit rate is 34 MB/s, peaking at 479 MB/s during a football match.

The V2V library reports detailed logs every 10 seconds for all resource exchanges. Over the 3 days, 4,615,045 chunks were exchanged. Each exchange is labeled with the mode (V2V or CDN) and, in the case of V2V, the remote viewer's ID. We also collect information about the time taken to download the chunk or if a chunk loss event occurred. Additionally, we gather various player-level information, such as watching time, video quality level, operating system, browser, city, country, ISP, etc. We also collect viewer information, including the number of simultaneous connections (swarm size), consecutive uploads, rebuffering time, and rebuffering count.

### 3.2 Clients Profiling and V2V Efficiency

The V2V paradigm inherits from the P2P paradigm, where a significant problem was user selfishness [1]. In our system, the V2V library is under our control, and the choice of a viewer to request a chunk from is random among the peers possessing the chunk. However, we observe a biased distribution of viewers' contributions, with 1% of the viewers responsible for over 90% of the bytes exchanged (Fig. 3). This bias is related to the time spent watching the channel. Most V2V data is sent by 1% of the viewers, who feature a bimodal distribution of session times, with around 25% staying less than 1 minute and the rest staying between 30 minutes and a few hours. In contrast, the overall distribution is dominated by short session times, with 60% of users staying less than 10 minutes.

Another factor affecting V2V exchanges is the network access characteristics. Since some content is downloaded from CDN servers, the average throughput achieved during CDN downloads provides a good hint of the user's network access capacity. As seen in Fig. 6, there is a significant difference between the CDN bitrates of the overall viewers and the most active 1% of viewers, who experience higher throughputs. The correlation coefficients between CDN bitrate and chunk loss rate (CLR) for overall viewers is -0.47, and for the most active top 1% viewers, it is -0.7. The CLR is highly correlated with the CDN throughput for the top 1% of users, indicating that this metric is a good estimator of reception quality.

The actual chunk loss rate (CLR) for overall viewers and the most active viewers is reported in Fig. 5. For the most active 1% of users, the distribution is skewed to the left, with over 50% experiencing less than 20% CLR, while the others experience a CLR uniformly distributed between 20 and 75%.

To further understand and reduce the observed CLR, we conduct a detailed study in the next section.

## 4. Detailed Analysis of Chunk Loss Rate (CLR)

In this section, we focus on the 1% most active users with more than 1 minute of session time. We formulate hypotheses to identify the root causes behind the observed lost data chunks:

- **H1:** The swarm size affects the lost chunk rate of a viewer. A larger swarm size increases control message traffic, potentially leading to a higher CLR.
- **H2:** The type of client access (mobile or fixed line) affects the lost chunk rate. While the library cannot collect detailed network information, we classify clients based on the user-agent HTTP string.
- **H3:** The network access link characteristics directly affect the CLR. We have already studied the download rate using transfers made with CDN servers. The upload rates achieved during V2V exchanges can also provide insights into the client's access link characteristics.
