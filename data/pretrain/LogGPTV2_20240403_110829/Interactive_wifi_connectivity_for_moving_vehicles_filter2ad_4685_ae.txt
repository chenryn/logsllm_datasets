Figure 12: Efﬁciency of medium usage in VanLAN.
Figure 12 shows the results for the TCP experiments in VanLAN
(§5.3.1). For upstream, we see that the efﬁciency of ViFi is better
than BRR and nearly as high as PerfectRelay. For downstream, all
three protocols have similar efﬁciency. BRR has slightly better ef-
ﬁciency because in ViFi the BS chosen to relay a packet may be
distant. Considering both directions together, we ﬁnd that ViFi is
slightly more efﬁcient.
5.5 Effectiveness of coordination
In this section, we present detailed statistics on the behavior of
ViFi to provide insight into the effectiveness of its coordination
mechanism. Table 1 shows data from the TCP experiments in Van-
LAN. Row B2 shows that ViFi has few false positives, that is, re-
layed packets that are already present at the destination divided by
the number of successful source transmissions. Comparison with
the average number of auxiliary BSes that receive the source trans-
mission (Row A2), we can infer that the coordination mechanism
of ViFi is effective at curtailing unnecessary relaying. Without that,
the false positive rate would have been 170% and 360%. Row A3
reveals that overhearing acknowledgments sent in response to ei-
ther the source or a relayed transmission is not sufﬁcient to curtail
false positives; probabilistic relaying is needed as well. If auxiliary
BSes deterministically relayed whenever they hear source transmis-
sion but not an acknowledgment, the false positive rate would have
been 60% and 250%.
Row C2 conﬁrms that auxiliary BSes are often in a position to
relay packets that do not reach the source. Row C3 shows that in
such cases, the false negative rate is low. We deﬁne false negative
rate as the number of times no auxiliary relays a failed transmission
divided by the number of failed source transmissions. Combining
the two rows, we can infer that roughly 65% of the lost source
transmissions are relayed in each direction.
5.5.1 Comparison with other formulations
We compare ViFi’s coordination mechanism with three other for-
mulations. Each formulation violates one of the three guidelines
outlined in §4.4.

We ﬁnd that compared to these other schemes ViFi strikes a good
balance between false positives and false negatives. Table 2 shows
the results for simulations over DieselNet’s Channel 1 environment.
We see that while the false negatives for all schemes are roughly
similar, ViFi has substantially lower false positives. Further, we
observe in our experiments that the number of packets saved by
¬G2 is a lot lower than ViFi and that the false positive rate of ¬G1
increases rapidly with the number of auxiliary BSes. As shown in
our technical report, application performance for all three schemes
is worse than that for ViFi [3].
5.5.2 Limitations
Finally, we tested the relaying mechanism of ViFi in a range of
simulated conditions to understand where it might perform poorly.
We ﬁnd two such conditions. First, when the number of auxiliary
BSes is high (e.g., greater than 15). Second, all auxiliary BSes
are equi-distant from both the source and the destination. In both
conditions, while the average number of relays per packet is one
(Eq. 1), the variance in the number of relays per packet increases,
resulting in higher false positives and negatives. Neither of these
situations arise in our testbed environments. To make ViFi robust
in environments where they might, it can be extended such that the
number of auxiliary BSes is limited or the symmetry between them
is broken. These extensions are subject of future work.
6. DEPLOYMENT ASPECTS OF ViFi
In this section, we comment brieﬂy on the deployment related
aspects of ViFi. ViFi requires changes to BSes and clients that may
create an initial barrier to adoption but we believe that these barri-
ers are surmountable. In the case of city-wide mesh networks [38,
39] operated by a single administrative entity, operators can unilat-
erally choose to deploy ViFi. In the case of organic deployments
in individual residences and ofﬁces, service models pioneered by
Fon [16], where a service provider supplies BSes for shared access,
can pave an effective deployment path.
A different issue is whether WiFi deployments would be broad
enough to enable more than a few city blocks of contiguous cov-
erage; the lack of coverage between WiFi islands can render inter-
active applications unusable. However, a mix of ViFi and cellular
modes can be used to maintain connectivity in such areas. Client
devices can use ViFi — the cheaper option — where available and
use cellular elsewhere. Some cellular providers already let users
switch between WiFi and cellular to save the more expensive cellu-
lar minutes [32].
Finally, ViFi is beneﬁcial only if clients often hear multiple BSes
on the same channel. While already true of organic deployments
(Section 3.4.1; CarTel [8]), this may not hold by default for city-
wide meshes if they are engineered in a cellular pattern with neigh-
boring BSes on different channels.
In this setting, BSes can be
equipped with an auxiliary radio such that neighbors of a BS are
tuned to the same channel as the BS. These auxiliary neighbors in-
terfere only minimally because they do not transmit often on the
BS-client channel. They transmit data on that channel only when
a downstream packet is overheard but the acknowledgment is not
heard. Upstream packets are not relayed on the BS-client channel.
7. RELATED WORK
Our work beneﬁts from and builds upon a large body of work in
wireless handoffs and routing. What sets it apart is its goals and the
unique constraints of its target environment: enabling common in-
teractive applications from moving vehicles using WiFi. We divide
prior work into four categories and contrast our work with exam-
ples of each.
Using multiple BSes
ViFi is inspired by the successful use of
macrodiversity in cellular networks [37], where multiple BSes act
in concert to improve client performance.2 The cellular methods,
however, require tight integration with the physical layer and strict
timing across BSes. These abilities need expensive BS hardware
that is not suitable for commodity wireless deployments. ViFi is a
macrodiversity method built on top of off-the-shelf WiFi radios.
In the WiFi context, Distributed Radio Bridges [23], Divert [25],
and MRD [26] also use multiple BSes to improve client perfor-
mance in enterprise WLAN deployments. The BS coordination
mechanism in these systems assumes that a high-capacity LAN is
available. For instance, in MRD, BSes coordinate by sending all
received frames to a central controller that is responsible for for-
warding only one copy to the Internet. Thus, if clients typically
2In contrast, microdiversity (e.g., MIMO) improves direct commu-
nication between two nodes. It brings complementary gains [13]
and can be used in our setting as well.
reach three BSes, the required LAN capacity is at least three times
the cumulative sending rate of all clients. Because a high-speed
backplane is typically not available in our setting, the coordination
mechanism of ViFi imposes little additional load on the backplane.
MultiNet [10], FatVAP [22], and PERM [36] enable clients to
associate with more than one nearby BS, to increase throughput
if the wireless capacity is greater than the capacity of wired links
behind the BSes. The focus of this work is improving connectivity
of the client-BS communication.
Opportunistic routing in static mesh networks
Protocols
such as ExOR [5] and MORE [9] share our goal and challenge in
leveraging opportunistic receipt of packets with low coordination
overhead. Their approach is to batch packets to amortize overhead
across the batch; the authors recommend using a batch size of at
least around ten. Batching, however, is unsuitable for most inter-
active uses. For instance, VoIP cannot afford the delay associated
with waiting for ten packets. For short TCP transfers, the sender’s
congestion window will frequently be smaller than the batch size.
Even for bigger transfers, batching may interact poorly with TCP’s
rate control, as mentioned by the authors of ExOR. ViFi, in contrast,
uses a novel probabilistic coordination mechanism that operates on
individual packets. In the future, we plan to study its performance
in static mesh scenarios as well.
Network access from moving vehicles
Early works on WiFi
performance for vehicular access are based on controlled settings,
with near line-of-sight connectivity and little interference [29, 17].
They ﬁnd a relatively benign environment. Our study of more re-
alistic settings, with WiFi and non-WiFi interferers and obstacles
such as trees and buildings, reveals a challenging radio environ-
ment with frequent disruptions.
Several works consider the problem of transferring data using
TCP through individual BSes as the vehicle drives by them, with-
out maintaining connections across BSes [8, 19, 14, 18]. They ﬁnd
that performance in this setting is severely hindered by overheads
at several layers, such as DHCP and aggressive TCP backoffs due
to losses, and propose methods to lower these overheads. We inves-
tigate the possibility of continuous connectivity across BSes. We
ﬁnd that even if some of the overheads they observe (e.g., DHCP)
are removed completely, the basic link layer connectivity remains
problematic, especially for interactive applications. An interesting
avenue for future work is to investigate the extent to which some
of the methods proposed by these works (e.g., for aggressive TCP
backoffs) are needed when the underlying link-layer connectivity
is improved using ViFi.
MobiSteer shows that equipping vehicles with directional anten-
nae can signiﬁcantly improve performance [28]. Our work is based
on omnidirectional antennae because, given the high cost and large
form factor of directional antennae, typical clients (e.g., laptops,
PDAs) are likely to have omnidirectional antennae. Further, while
directional antennae extend reach, they do not prevent connectivity
disruptions which we show can occur even close to BSes. ViFi can
complement the gains from directionality when multiple BSes are
visible in the current sector of the antenna.
Rodriguez et al. study the performance of vehicular clients while
transferring data using cellular networks [33]. WiFi, the focus of
our work, merits an independent examination. It differs from cel-
lular in many ways, has a much shorter range, and operates in un-
licensed spectrum. We ﬁnd it interesting that even though the cel-
lular technology is expensive and the networks carefully planned,
like us, these authors ﬁnd a challenging radio environment with
unpredictable and sharp drops in connection quality.
Fast Handoffs
There is a large body of work on minimizing
the delay associated with handoffs in wireless networks [31, 2, 34,
6, 20]. This delay can be a major source of disruption in networks
that otherwise have good wireless connectivity. Our work instead
is focused on improving the basic connectivity itself which is quite
challenging even if the handoff delays are minimal.
8. CONCLUSIONS
Our work improves WiFi performance for interactive applica-
tions. Using measurements from testbeds in two different cities, we
showed that hard handoff methods that are used by WiFi clients to-
day are poorly suited for the vehicular environment. These methods
lead to frequent disruptions in connectivity. We also showed that
methods that leverage basestation diversity are effective because
they mask many disruptions.
We then designed, ViFi, a practical and efﬁcient handoff protocol
that exploits opportunistic receptions by nearby BSes to minimize
disruptions for clients. The key to its effectiveness is a decentral-
ized probabilistic algorithm that obviates per-packet coordination.
Based on a two-month long deployment and trace-driven simula-
tions, we showed that ViFi has close to ideal link-layer performance
and signiﬁcantly improves interactive experience. Our deployed
prototype doubled the number of successful TCP transfers and dou-
bled the length of disruption-free VoIP calls compared to a hard
handoff protocol.
