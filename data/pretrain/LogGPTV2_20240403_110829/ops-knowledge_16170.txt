I have a device connected to my PC via a serial port. Using C-Kermit, I can send commands to the device and read its output. Additionally, I can transfer files using the Kermit protocol.

In Python, there is a well-regarded library called `pySerial` that I can use to send and receive data from the device. However, I am looking for a solution to transfer files using the Kermit protocol in Python. 

**Solution:**

You can achieve this by leveraging the `subprocess` module in Python. The following steps outline a general approach, assuming you already have the ability to send commands to your remote device and parse the results.

1. **Establish a Serial Connection:**
   - Use `pySerial` to establish a connection to the remote system through the serial port.

2. **Run Kermit Client on the Remote System:**
   - Execute the Kermit client on the remote system with the appropriate command-line switches to initiate the file transfer over the serial port.

3. **Disconnect the Serial Connection:**
   - Close the `pySerial` connection to free up the serial port.

4. **Start the Kermit Client on the Local System:**
   - Use the `subprocess` module to start the Kermit client on your local machine and accept the incoming files.

5. **Reconnect and Clean Up:**
   - Re-establish the `pySerial` connection if needed.
   - Perform any necessary cleanup or post-processing.

**Example Workflow:**

```python
import subprocess
import serial

# Step 1: Establish a serial connection
ser = serial.Serial('COM1', 9600)  # Adjust port and baud rate as needed

# Step 2: Send a command to the remote system to start the Kermit client
ser.write(b'kermit -s /path/to/file\n')  # Adjust the command as needed

# Step 3: Disconnect the serial connection
ser.close()

# Step 4: Start the Kermit client on the local system
subprocess.run(['kermit', '-r'])

# Step 5: Reconnect the serial connection (if needed)
ser = serial.Serial('COM1', 9600)

# Cleanup
ser.close()
```

**Note:**
- This is a general approach and may require adjustments based on your specific setup and requirements.
- When I implemented a similar solution a few years ago (using `os.system` instead of `subprocess` on a SuperDOS system), it took some time to understand that I needed to start the Kermit client remotely to send the file to my local client.
- If I find some time this week, I will try to set up one of my old Geode boards and provide some working code examples.
