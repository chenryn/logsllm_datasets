graph does not contain any double spending. Since this global graph
is a superset of read outputs of honest parties (as per F cread), this
implies that Corda protects honest clients from double spending.
Liveness. F cupdRnd guarantees that transactions which involve
only honest clients end up in the global graph after an upper
bounded delay (once all clients have acknowledged the transac-
tion). Furthermore, F cread ensures that transactions with honest
initiators end up in the local state of all honest signees after an-
other bounded time delay. By Theorem 4.1, these properties directly
translate to Corda. A stronger liveness statement is not possible for
Corda: if a notary is corrupted (and by extension all clients that rely
on this notary also consider themselves to be corrupted), then a
transaction might never be signed by that notary and hence not en-
ter the global graph. Further, since the initiator is solely responsible
for forwarding responses from the notary, such a response might
not end up in the local state of a signee if the initiator misbehaves.
Privacy. Privacy needs a bit more explanation than the other
properties. Firstly, observe that F cread ensures that honest parties
can only read transactions that are part of their potential knowl-
edge, i. e., those they are directly involved in or that have been
forwarded to them by someone that already knew the transaction.
Furthermore, by definition of F csubmit, if no dishonest client is in-
volved in a new transaction, only the length of the body is leaked.
For Corda, this implies that the body of a transaction that involves
only honest clients (and in extension an honest notary) stays secret
from everyone, unless one of those clients intentionally forwards
the transaction to another party.
We can also derive what a dishonest client or dishonest notary
in Corda can learn at most, thereby determining the level of privacy
that Corda provides: By definition of F csubmit and Fleak, all of the
metadata of transactions is leaked. In contrast, the message bodies
of transactions leak only if they involve a dishonest client. Hence,
an adversary on Corda learns at most the metadata of transactions,
all transaction bodies that use a dishonest notary, and all transac-
tion bodies that involve a dishonest client. An adversary cannot
learn anything else since otherwise the simulation of dishonest
clients/notaries would fail, i. e., Theorem 4.1 could not be shown.
We note that Corda indeed leaks (some) meta-information of
transactions. This is because an outside adversary can observe
the network communication, which in itself strongly depends and
changes based on the meta-information of a transaction. For exam-
ple, the initiator of an honest transaction collects the approvals of
all signees, which makes it trivial to derive the set of participating
clients. Similarly, the notary is obvious from watching where a
transaction is sent by the initiator after collecting approvals from
signees. Even the set of inputs to a transaction is partially visible
as, e.g., the signees and the notary request missing inputs from
the initiator. While we slightly over approximate this information
leakage by leaking the full meta-information in F cledger, it is not
possible to obtain a reasonably stronger privacy statement for meta-
information in Corda.
Furthermore, observe that the adversary on F cledger is allowed
to obtain IDs for arbitrary transactions. This captures that the
IDs of transactions in Corda are computed as hashes over the full
transaction, including the body of the transaction in plain. Hence,
if an attacker gets hold of such an ID, then he can use it to try and
brute force the content of the transaction.
Finally, observe that an adversary on F cledger is also allowed to
validate arbitrary transactions with respect to the current partial
view of some honest client, which might in particular leak informa-
tion about input states. This captures the following attack on Corda:
If an adversary is in control of a notary and he knows an ID of a
(currently secret) transaction ùë°ùë• from an honest client, then he can
create (and let the notary sign) a new transaction ùë°ùë•‚Ä≤ that uses one
or more output states from the secret transaction ùë°ùë• as input. Now,
the adversary can push this transaction via a corrupted client to the
honest client, which then verifies the transaction and, depending
on whether verification succeeds, adds ùë°ùë•‚Ä≤ to his partial view of
the global state. Since this is generally observable, the adversary
learns the result of the verification, which, depending on the smart
contracts involved, might leak parts of ùë°ùë•.
We emphasize that both of the above leakages, respectively at-
tacks, on Corda are possible only if an ID of a transaction is leaked
by a higher-level protocol, illustrating the importance of the IDs for
secrecy. Since we consider arbitrary higher-level protocols (simu-
lated by the environment) in our proof, we cannot circumvent these
leakages. However, if we were to consider a specific higher-level
protocol, say, Q using Corda/the ideal ledger such that Q keeps
the transaction IDs secret (at least for honest parties), then one can
actually prove that Corda in this specific context realizes a variant
of F cledger that does not leak transaction IDs, does not give access
to a hash oracle, and does not leak verification results. But, again,
our results show that this is not true in general.
