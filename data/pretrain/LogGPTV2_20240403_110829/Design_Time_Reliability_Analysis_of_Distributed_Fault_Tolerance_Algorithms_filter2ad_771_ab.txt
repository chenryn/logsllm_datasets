cal clock values. The Welch and Lynch algorithm guaran-
tees synchronized clocks as long as n > 3a + b for n total
nodes, a asymmetric faults and b benign faults. In the worst
case, an asymmetric faulty node could send a too-high value
to one node and a too-low value to another. For a benign
fault, the frame could arrive too early or too late at all re-
ceivers. To separate failure causes, our modeled maximum
fault assumption (MFA) in Table 3 checks asymmetric and

benign faults separately. Since the modeling tools check
conditions in order, states that fail to satisfy MFA.1 (for ex-
ample) will not be checked further for MFA.2.
For TDMA clock synchronization, symmetric faults
mentioned previously are equivalent to benign faults since
there are no undetectably invalid frames. In a TDMA sys-
tem, a frame’s arrival time is calculated with respect to a
time slot deﬁned by the receiver’s local clock. If the frame
is too early or too late, it will be considered invalid. Un-
like an explicitly transmitted timestamp, undetected timing
faults are not possible since a frame arriving within the slot
window is valid by deﬁnition, and a frame arriving outside
the slot window is detectably invalid by deﬁnition. For a
different fault model, undetected faults might be possible.
Recently, an improved bound was developed for a fam-
ily of approximate agreement algorithms. Azadmanesh and
Kieckhafer obtained better fault tolerance for strictly omis-
sive asymmetric faults by enabling voting on different sized
local sets [3]. The improved bound is n > 3a + b + α, for
n nodes, a asymmetric faults, b benign faults and α strictly
omissive asymmetric faults. For clock synchronization, all
asymmetric faults caused by non-malicious physical phe-
nomena will be strictly omissive asymmetric, since a frame
is either valid or detectably invalid. Therefore, the maxi-
mum fault assumption reduces to n > b + α. Three max-
imum fault conditions were checked in order to determine
the dominant cause of failure, listed in Table 3.
For clock synchronization, the system state S is given by
the tuple {GN , PBN , TAN , TBN , AN C, BN C, CONV, GC,
PAC, PBC, TAC, TBC}, where Σ (GN , PBN , TAN , TBN ,
AN C, BN C, CONV) equals the total number of nodes N and
Σ (GC, PAC, PBC, TAC, TBC) equals the total number of
channels C. Unfortunately, a graphical representation would
be prohibitive. The smallest clock synchronization models
(four nodes) had 333 states and 2750 transitions. The largest
clock synchronization models (fourteen nodes) had 24,783
states and 227,560 transitions. Our previous work contains
a graphical model, although for a different protocol [22].
Table 4 lists the clock synchronization model transitions.
A transition moves one or more nodes or channels from a
good state to a faulty state, or vice-versa, as speciﬁed in
the Source and Dest. columns. The number of nodes or
channels involved in the transition is listed in the Items col-
umn. The guard and the reason for the transition are given
next. A guard is a condition that must be true for the tran-
sition to be taken. For example, for a node to transition
to a faulty state due to faulty channels, all channels must
be faulty at that point in time (otherwise, at least one valid
frame would be transmitted). The rate range tested is given
in the last column. For most transitions, each component
(node or channel) has an equal and independent probability
of being affected, so the rate is multiplied by the number of
nodes or channels in the source state. The Table 4 transi-
tions were determined as follows (from top to bottom).
Permanent Hardware Faults. A fail-silent node will
not send any frames. This behavior is detectable by all re-
ceivers due to the TDMA schedule. Therefore, this fault is
permanent benign.
Table 5. Membership Maximum Fault Assumption
Membership MFA.1: If (∃a), then a + s + b = 1 for a asymmetric, s symmetric, and b benign nodes
Membership MFA.2: s ≤ g for s symmetric and g good nodes
Membership MFA.3: g ≥ 3 for g good nodes
SEL. Single Event Latchup may cause a node to trans-
mit an improperly formatted frame or transmit a frame at
the wrong time. For clock synchronization, a frame must be
both on time and correctly formatted, so we model SEL as
permanent benign.
per round. For channels, a channel is considered good if it
can send a frame. Transient channel faults (namely, bit er-
rors) are assumed to have a duration of one frame, which is
an appropriate model for bit errors. The transient expiration
rates are stated as 1 / (duration in hours).
3.3 Group Membership Model and Mapping
The reliability of a group membership service depends
on the diagnosis strategy chosen. A group membership ser-
vice guarantees that all correct nodes in the group reach
consensus on the members of the group within a certain pe-
riod of time after a fault. The diagnosis strategy dictates
which nodes to convict and remove from the group (if any).
The maximum fault assumption we use in Table 5 ex-
tends the TTP/C single fault hypothesis slightly with re-
spect to benign and symmetric faults when no asymmetric
faults are present. The TTP/C group membership maximum
fault assumption is that exactly one fault may occur within
two rounds, worst-case [27]. Since the modeling techniques
we use do not explicitly support a notion of rounds, MFA.1
states there may not be an asymmetric faulty node and an-
other faulty node at the same time. If only symmetric and
benign faults are present, the system should operate as long
as half of the group members are good nodes (MFA.2), due
to the TTP/C Clique Avoidance procedure [37], p. 68. The
minimum fault tolerant conﬁguration is four nodes with at
least three good nodes (MFA.3) [37], p. 27. These exten-
sions for symmetric and benign faults have not been for-
mally proven; however, we believe that a single MFA con-
dition of no two simultaneous faults would be pessimistic.
We examine three diagnosis strategies. The standard
strategy convicts all faulty nodes and removes them from
the group (Convict All). The second strategy is the oppo-
site: no faulty nodes are ever convicted (Convict None).
The third strategy attempts to convict permanent faulty
nodes and to leave transient faulty nodes in the group, with
some misclassiﬁcation (Convict Some). Note that the new
strategies are not formally proven – the goal is to investigate
robust application level diagnosis. For example, these could
be run at the FlexRay application layer.
Alternatively, one could restate the diagnosis strategies
as rapid reintegration rules. For the Convict None strategy,
nodes could join the group right after two rounds when con-
sensus is reached. For the Convict Some strategy, the group
could use a threshold where nodes are allowed into the
group immediately after consensus, up until f faults within
some time t when the node is permanently removed from
the group. Since reintegration is substantially decoupled
from membership, this could minimize any proof changes.
Table 6 lists the states and transitions for the hypoth-
esized membership service, and Table 7 lists the convic-
tion probabilities studied. Here we review changes from
SEU. Single Event Upset is modeled as a transient bit
upset (either detected by other nodes or local error codes).
If this occurs at the sending node, the effect would be be-
nign. If this occurs in the clock synchronization logic of the
receiver, this might be asymmetric, since a transient SEU
might alter a single frame only. (If all frames were altered,
the receiver would be benign faulty since it would not stay
synchronized). The SEU rate is multiplied by the number
of susceptible bits (here, 64 kilobytes is modeled). An SEU
would have to hit a certain portion of the integrated circuit
to cause the asymmetric fault described, modeled as 10 kilo-
bytes with sensitivity analysis in Section 4.
Lightning. Lightning is modeled as affecting half of
the nodes simultaneously. These nodes are temporarily be-
nign, recovering after the strike. In general, electromagnetic
interference could have many other effects.
Permanent Link Faults. Link faults can have two ef-
fects. If a single link between a node and the bus/star cou-
pler fails, the channel appears to be asymmetric faulty, since
some nodes will receive the frame and others will not. If the
entire bus/star coupler fails silent, then the channel delivers
no frames and appears to be benign faulty. We studied a
range for the ﬁrst case, and modeled the second case as a
permanent hardware failure at a rate of 10−6 failures/hour.
BER. Noise on the communication channel can also
have two effects when detected.
If the noise is localized
near a subset of receivers, the channel will appear to be
asymmetric faulty, delivering different frames to different
receivers. If the noise affects all receivers, the channel will
appear to be benign faulty since no receivers get a valid
frame. The BER is multiplied by the bandwidth and con-
verted to hours to get the rate per hour.
Perceived Faulty Nodes due to Faulty Channels.
If
there are no good channels, and at least one asymmetric
channel, then the sender will be perceived as asymmetric
faulty since some receivers may get a valid frame and others
may receive none (for example, if jitter causes the frame to
be received too late at a subset of the receivers). If there
are no good channels, and no asymmetric faulty channels,
no valid frame will be sent to any receiver and the sender
will appear benign faulty. Each time a frame is sent, one
good node will be affected, for a rate of 1 / Frame Duration.
These transitions are not multiplied by the number of nodes
in the source state since there is only one sender at a time
(this also applies to transient fault expiration).
Transient Fault Expiration. All transient faults in the
model eventually expire. For nodes, the effective fault du-
ration is one message round, since a sender transmits once
