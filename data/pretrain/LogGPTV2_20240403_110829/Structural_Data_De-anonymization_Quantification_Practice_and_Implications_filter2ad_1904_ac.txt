Ga and Gu shown in Fig. 1 as an example, the DE of the
perfect DA scheme σ0 is Ψσ0 = 20. For another DA scheme
σ = (σ0 \ {(4, 4), (5, 5)}) ∪ {(4, 5), (5, 4)} (users 4 and 5 are
incorrectly de-anonymized to each other), its DE is Ψσ =
28. In the following subsections, we quantify a DA attack
by studying the conditions on G and the projection process
under which perfect and (1 − ϵ)-perfect DA attacks can be
conducted.
4.3 Perfect DA Quantiﬁcation
Now, we quantify the conditions for perfect DA attacks.
Some useful properties of the binomial distribution that will
be used in the proofs are as follows.
Lemma 1. (i) Let X ∼ B(n1, p) and Y ∼ B(n2, p) be
independent binomial variables. Then, X + Y is again a
binomial variable and X + Y ∼ B(n1 + n2, p); (ii) [5] Let X
and Y be two binomial random variables with means λx and
2Based on the projection process, Ga and Gu are also ER
random graphs G(n, p · pa) and G(n, p · pu), respectively.

Then, when λx > λy, Pr(X − Y ≤ 0) ≤
2 exp(− (λx−λy )2
8(λx+λy ) ).
4.3.1 Same Projection Probability
First, we consider the scenario that the projection pro-
cesses from G to Ga and Gu are characterized by the same
probability ℘, i.e., pa = pu = ℘. Let f℘ = ℘[l(1−h℘)−h(1−℘)]2
2(l(1−h℘)+h(1−℘))
be a variable depending on ℘. Then, we have the follow-
ing Theorem 1 which indicates the conditions on ℘ and f℘
such that it is asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.)3
that
Ψσ ≥ Ψσ0 for any DA scheme σ ̸= σ0. We defer the proof
to Appendix A for readability.
Theorem 1. For any σ ̸= σ0, let k be the number of
diﬀerent mappings between σ and σ0, i.e., the number of
incorrect mappings in σ. Then, 2 ≤ k ≤ n and Pr(Ψσ ≥
Ψσ0 ) →
h−hl and f℘ = Ω( 2 ln n+1
n→∞ 1 when ℘ > h−l
).
kn
In Theorem 1, we quantiﬁed the condition on ℘, l, and h
under which the perfect DA scheme σ0 will cause less DE
than any other given DA scheme σ ̸= σ0. To guarantee
the uniqueness of σ0 (i.e., σ0 is the one and the only one
DA scheme introducing the least DE), intuitively, stronger
conditions on ℘, l, and h are required. We quantify such
conditions in Theorem 2. We defer the proof to Appendix
B for readability.
Theorem 2. Let E be the event that there exists at least
one DA scheme σ ̸= σ0 such that Ψσ ≤ Ψσ0 . When ℘ >
), where 2 ≤ k ≤ n, Pr(E) →
h−l
h−hl and f℘ = Ω( (k+3) ln n+1
0, i.e., it is a.a.s. that @σ s.t. σ ̸= σ0 and Ψσ ≤ Ψσ0 .
kn
kn
h−hl and f℘ = Ω( (k+3) ln n+1
From Theorem 2, although we seek a stronger result, the
condition on ℘ is the same as in Theorem 1 and the condition
on f℘ only has an increase of order Θ(k). Based on Theorem
2, if ℘ > h−l
), the perfect DA
scheme causes the least DE. Furthermore, the number of
possible DA schemes is upper-bounded. Therefore, when the
conditions on ℘ and f℘ are satisﬁed, Ga can mathematically
be perfectly de-anonymized by Gu based on the structure
information only.
4.3.2 Different Projection Probabilities
Now, we quantify the conditions on pa, pu, l, and h when
pa ̸= pu for structure based perfect DA attacks. Let gpa,pu =
papu
4(l(pa+pu−2hpapu)+h(pa+pu−2papu)) be t-
pa+pu
wo variables depending on pa and pu. Then, we have the fol-
lowing theorems quantifying the conditions on gpa,pu , fpa,pu , l,
and h under which it is a.a.s. Ψσ ≥ Ψσ0 for any σ ̸= σ0.
and fpa,pu = (l(pa+pu−2hpapu)−h(pa+pu−2papu))2
We omit the proofs due to space limitation.
Theorem 3. Pr(Ψσ ≥ Ψσ0 ) → 1 for any σ ̸= σ0 when
gpa,pu > h−l
2(h−lh) and fpa,pu = Ω( 2 ln n+1
kn
).
Theorem 4. It is a.a.s. that @σ s.t. σ ̸= σ0 and Ψσ ≤
2(h−lh) and fpa,pu = Ω( (k+3) ln n+1
),
Ψσ0 when gpa,pu > h−l
where 2 ≤ k ≤ n.
kn
From Theorem 4, to guarantee the uniqueness of inducing
the least DE of σ0, which is a stronger conclusion compared
n → ∞, with probability goes to 1 an event happens.
3Asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.)
implies that as
with that in Theorem 3, the condition on gpa,pu is the same
as in Theorem 3 and the condition on fpa,pu has an increase
of Θ(k). Furthermore, Theorem 4 quantiﬁes the conditions
under which the anonymized structural data can be mathe-
matically perfectly de-anonymized when pa ̸= pu.
(1 − ϵ)-Perfect DA Quantiﬁcation
4.4
Formally, we deﬁne a (1 − ϵ)-perfect DA, denoted by σϵ,
as a DA scheme under which at most ϵ|V a| = ϵn users are
tolerated to be incorrectly de-anonymized, where 0 ≤ ϵ ≤ 1.
Under the (1 − ϵ)-perfect DA assumption, any σk is prop-
er as long as k ≤ ϵn, i.e., we take it as a satisﬁable de-
anonymizatoin solution. Theoretically, the conditions on
(1 − ϵ)-perfect DA are quantiﬁed in Theorems 5 and 6.
Again, we omit the proofs due to space limitation. Note
that, when we quantify the conditions for (1− ϵ)-perfect de-
aonymization, we do not distinguish σ0 and σk with k ≤ ϵn,
since they are all proper solutions. Hence, as in the scenario
of perfect DA, our quantiﬁcation takes σ0 as the reference
point.

kn ) to Ω( ln n
From Theorem 5, we can see that (i) for any DA scheme
σk, if it has more than ϵn incorrect mappings, with proba-
bility 1, it will cause more DE than σ0. On the other hand,
if σk is a (1 − ϵ)-perfect DA scheme, i.e., k ≤ ϵn, we cannot
a.a.s. distinguish σk and σ0 based on DE under the quan-
tiﬁed conditions; (ii) compared with the quantiﬁcations in
Theorems 1 and 3, the conditions on f℘ and fpa,pu change
from Ω( ln n
n2 ) explicitly, which implies a relaxation
of the condition on f℘ and fpa,pu . This relaxation comes
from the toleration of ϵn incorrect user mappings. As in the
scenario of perfect DA, stronger conditions can be quantiﬁed
to guarantee (1 − ϵ)-perfect DA schemes causing the least
DE as shown in Theorem 6. From Theorem 6, we can see
that even ϵn matching errors are tolerated, the conditions on
℘ and gpa,pu stay the same while the conditions on f℘ and
fpa,pu only have some constant relaxation compared with
the perfect DA scenario.
5. LARGE SCALE EVALUATION ON RE-
AL WORLD STRUCTURAL DATASETS
According to our quantiﬁcation, even without semantic
priori knowledge, anonymized structural data can be de-
anonymized perfectly or (1 − ϵ)-perfectly.
In this section,
we conduct comprehensive evaluations of our DA quantiﬁ-
cation on 26 real world structural datasets4.
4We actually conduct evaluations on 60+ real world
datasets. Due to space limitation, the results on 26 repre-
sentative datasets are shown in the paper. Complete results
and source codes are available up to request.
