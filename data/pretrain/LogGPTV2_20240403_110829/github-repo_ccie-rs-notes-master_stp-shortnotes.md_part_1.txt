# 802.1D STP and improvements
* 802.1D for STP originally
* 802.1w RSTP
* 802.1s MSTP
* 802.1D-2004 now only RSTP
* 802.1s integrated into 802.1Q-2005
![STP BPDU](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stuh84/ccie-rs-notes/master/images/stp-bpdu.png)
STP  
* Protocol ID of 0x0000
* Protocol Ver - 0x00
* BPDU field shows config and tcn BPDUs
* Flags handles TC events (TC Ack flag and TC flag)
* Fields after show root bridge, distance of BPDU sender to root, sender bridge ID, sender port ID that BPDU traversed
* MessageAge - Set to 0 at root, others increment by 1 before forwarding
* Remaining lifetime of bpdu is MaxAge-MessageAge
* Timers reflect timers of root (MaxAge, HelloTime, ForwardDelay)
IDs of bridges and ports in BPDU. All have configurable priority.
Config BPDUs compared, superior based upon lowest: -
* RBID
* Root Path Cost
* Sender BID
* Sender PID
* Receiver PID (not in BPDU, local)
Above is order. Only config BPDUs compared. One RP on non-root, one DP per segment. TCNs not compared.
STP stores superior BPDU sent/received. Root and blocking ports store upstream BPDU, DP store own
BPDU lasts for MaxAge-MessageAge seconds
BID - 2 byte priority then MAC
## Choosing ports
1. Elect root switch (lowest BID)
2. Choose RP - Superior BPDU to root
3. Choose DP - Swich that forwards superior BPDU from all forwarded BPDUs on segment
### Electing Root
* All claim root until superior BPDU
* Once sup received, advertised on
802.1t amended BID for PVST+ and MST. Made priority 4 bits (multiples of 4096), 12 bits for Sys Ex ID (usually Vlan ID). Called MAC address reduction. VLAN IDs make ID unique (VLAN ID plus switch MAC). Configure with **spanning-tree extend system-id**, newer switches can't remove this command.
### Determining RP
1. Root sends hellos (default 2 seconds). Contains RBID and SBID (Root ID for both), RPC 0, SPID of egress
2. Nonroot adds port cost to RPC in BPDU, superior becomes RP
3. Hellos from RP sent out DP (updated RPC, SBID, SPID and MessageAge)
4. No hellos on blocking ports
Least path cost to root. RPC on received port added to BPDU.
Port costs: -
Standard | 10M | 100M | 1G | 10G
---------|-----|------|----|----
Pre-802.1D-1998 |100|10|1|1|
802.1D-1998|100|19|4|2|
802.1D-2004|2000000|200000|20000|2000
1998 default on most CAT switches. 2004 for MST by default. Change with **spanning-tree pathcost method long**
### Determining DP
* Hellos forwarded onto LAN segment by designated switch
* Port forwarding is DP
* ALl others root or blocked
* Superior hellos
Tiebreakers same as before
### Summary of rules
* Root Switch - Lowest BID
* RP - Least path cost to root
* DP - Sends best BPDUs to segment
* ALl other ports blocking
* Config BPDUs only from DP (would be inferior on other ports, including RP)
* Each port stores best BPDU sent/received. DP store best sent, RP and block store best rx'd
* RXd BPDUs expire - MaxAge-MessageAge
## Converging to a new STP topology
When stable, BPDUs unchanged, same results calculated.
TC event when: -
* TCN BPDU rx'd on DP
* Port moves to forwarding and switch has at least one DP
* Port moves from Learning or forwarding to block
* Switch becomes root
During TC, switch sends BPDUs with updated contents. Neighbours recalculate ports
## TCN and updating CAM
* Switches instructed to age out unused CAM entries
* Forward Delay timer (default 15s) to time out CAM entries
TCNs go to Root, root informs switches. TCNs sent as config BPDUs cannot go upstream.
1. TC occurs
2. Switch sends TCN BPDUs out RP until acked
3. Upstream switch acks with next hello, marks TCA bit
4. Upstream repeats 1-3
5. When TCN at root, BPDU with TCA sent through rx'd port
6. For MaxAge+ForwardDelay seconds, root sends BPDUs with TC bit set, all switches time out CAM entries
## Transitioning from blocking to forwarding
No immediate change as loop potential.
Listening then learning, both ForwardDelay (default 15s)
Listening - No forwarding, no MAC learning
Learning - No forwarding, MAC learning
# PVST and STP over trunks
PVST+ has STP per VLAN. Different roots, different ints for forwarding/blocking.
With 802.1Q and non-Cisco switches, only CST.
PVST+ runs on trunks as VLAN 1 STP instance. In CST regions, binding for all VLANs. In PVST+ region, only for 1 VLAN.
* CST treated as loop-free shared segment
* PVST+ BPDUs encapd with multicast dest mac of 0100.0CCC.CCCD, tagged with correct VLAN
* Using SNAP encap (ordinary BPDUs use LLC). 
* TLV at end of BPDU with VLAN number of BPDU. Used to check for native VLAN mismatches
* VLAN1 on PVST+ uses standard BPDUs and PVST+ BPDU. PVST+ one only for mismatches
When sending BPDUs, access ports tx IEEE BPDUs to their access VLANs.
Trunks do: -
* IEEE BPDU for VLAN 1 (untagged)
* PVST+ BPDUs for all existing and allowed VLANs
If access port gets BPDU with wrong VLAN, Type Inconsistent.
On trunk: 
* IEEE BPDUs processed by VLAN 1 STP instance
* PVST+ BPDUs go through: -
1. Check VLAN tag, if tagged, BPDU in that VLAN. If no tag, native VLAN
2. Check PVID TLV. If no match, PVIDInconsitent state, BPDU dropped
3. If PVID TLV match, processed by VLAN STP. PVST+ VLAN 1 duplicate of IEEE.
## STP Config and Analysis
**show spanning-tree root** - If on root, "This bridge is root"
**spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 28672**
```
int Fa0/1
 spanning-tree vlan 1 cost 100
```
**spanning-tree vlan vlan-id root { primary | secondary } [diameter value] - Diameter lowers timers, sets pririty to 24756 if current root larger, or 4096 below root. Secondary set to 28672 always.

IEEE 802.1w
## New port roles, states types and link types
Discarding, Learning and Forwarding only. Can be Discarding or Forwarding unlimited time, learning transitions.
Discarding - No forwarding or MAC learning, processes rx BPDUs, sends BPDUs, tx/rx switch protocls (LLDP, VTP etc)
Four port roles: -
* RP - As before
* DP - As Before
* Alternate - Replacement of root
* Backup - replacement of DP
RP and DP can be in Disc or Learn states, or skipped with proposal agreement
**AP**
* Rx BPDUs, not meeting RP or DP rquirements
* Alt path to root
* If RP lost, AP with best BPDU promoted
**BP**
* RX BPDUs from same switch
* Attached to same link as another port on switch
* Takes over if DP fails, not rapid
AP protects against direct link failure.
BP not rapid as a shared link. Becomes Designated Discarding after three BPDUs lost on DP. One remains best, rest back to Backup Discarding. Moves through disc-learn-forwarding
Edge or Non-Edge ports. Edge port immediately forwarding. Expects no BPDUs, or will revert to non-edge
Default port type is non-edge
Link types of P2p and shared
* P2P - To anotehr RSTP switch
* Shared - To multiple switches
If link half duplex, assumed shared. Reverts to STP timers and operation.
Set with **spanning-tree link-type {point-to-point | shared}**
## Changes to BPDU format and handling
* Single BPDU for config and TCN
* Protocol verison 2
* Flags for all 8 bits
 * Proposal bit
 * Port role bits
 * Learning bits
 * Forwarding bit
 * agreement bit
* Allows Proposal/Agreement, and originating port's role and state
BPDUs originated by all switches, based on info stored on RP. If RSTP BPDUs cease on port, problem contain on link between switch and nieghbour. RSTP ages out BPDUs after 3 hellos. MessageAge now only a hop count. If MessageAge higher than MaxAge, BPDU discarded
Inferior BPDUs immediately accepted and stored, as it implies a change.
## Proposal/Agreement
* If RP would go onto new link, remaining ports can move from RP or AP to DP. Others may be DP, causing loop.
* Loops need preventing locally, could also be lower cost path
P/A is a port proposing to be DP, agreement saying it can.
On new link installation: -
* Both ends Designated Discarding
* DPs in discarding/learning state send BPDU with proposal bit set
* If one side sees BPDU now best resulting BPDU, goes from DP to RP (stays discarding)
* Proposal on RP makes all non-edge DPs int discarding (Sync state), no possible loops
* Once done, RP to forwarding, upstream allowed to change state to forwarding (agreement bit set after Sync)
This cascades down switches. Ports without portfast wont take part, so go back to STP timers. Use edge ports
## TCN handling in RSTP
Non-edge port going from non-forwarding to forwarding is TC event. Loss of forwarding means loss of MAC reachability.
* BPDUs flooded with TC flag set
* Switch seeing TCN sets tcWhile time to hello plus 1 sec on all non-edge DP and RP (if any) export if port where TC learned/detected
* Flush macs on these ports
* Sends TC flagged BPDUs on these ports until tcWhile expires
# RPVST+
* RSTP per VLAN
* Same behaviour per instance as RSTP
* Backwards comaptible with RPVST+
* **spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst**
* spanning-tree portfast or spanning-tree portfast default
* Non p2p switches revert to 802.1D or PVST to legacy switches
# MST: IEEE 802.1s
* Tune STP parameters per instance
* Less instances
* RSTP for convergence
* Limit on instances on certain platforms (128 on 2960, 3560 and 3750), true of RPVST+ and MST
## Principles of operation
All switches in region configed with same VLAN mappings, same instances etc
* System ID extension used
* 0-4095 for instances (2950 only support 0-15)
* Allows 65 active MST instances (0 plus 64 user)
* Single BPDU for all instance info, must fit in a frame (88 hypothetically, but 64 is limit)
* IST is Instance 0
* All VLANs default to IST
* IST interacts outside MST region
* All VLANs must inherit port state of IST on region boundary
* MST region seen as single switch outside it (CST blocks loops between regions)
* ISTs on region boundaries constitute an SPT between regions of links only on boundaries
* CST has no per vlan ability, is for loop free paths, and for interaction with non-MST swithes.
* CST costs only cost of links between regions (external costs)
* CST on region boundary merges with IST inside it (known as CIST)
* Multiple roots due to those in each region. One for entire region, rest per region (CIST Region Root)
CIST Root elected by lowest BID from all switches in CIST. IST BID formed from IST priority, instance number 0 and base MAC. Also all STP and RSTP switches form this (using their only BIDs)
