### Apache Airflow version
Other Airflow 2 version (please specify below)
### What happened
I am running airflow 2.4.2 in EKS 1.22 with minor tweaks to official helm
chart. I am observing in UI, in task logs each log line is coming twice.
Attaching a screen-shot below of the issue. As visible here all log lines are
repeated twice in task log file.

### What you think should happen instead
Each log line should be coming once in task logs, this is important as task
logs will take twice the space as required.
### How to reproduce
Should be able to reproduce by running any dag on airflow 2.4.2 with official
helm chart on EKS v1.22 and observing task logs.
