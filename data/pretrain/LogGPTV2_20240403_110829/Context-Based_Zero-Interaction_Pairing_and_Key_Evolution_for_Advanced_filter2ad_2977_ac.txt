with other devices based on derived context informa-
tion.
3. After the number of successful key evolution steps for
identity X reaches a speciﬁed threshold value αthr ,
check if the acceptance criteria listed below hold. If
either criterion does not hold, the key evolution pro-
cess is continued, and acceptance criteria re-evaluated
after each successful key evolution step for identity X .
The ﬁrst acceptance criterion requires that in order to be
accepted as genuine, a peer device d ’s pairing key under
an identity X needs to have a suﬃcient authenticity rating
α(ID X
d ), and this rating has to be higher than any other
peer’s rating for X by a speciﬁed margin αmarg in order to
make the determination of the correct peer unambiguous.
Criterion 1
(Authenticity dominance).
Let αmin , αmarg ∈ [0, 1] denote a minimal authenticity thresh-
old and an authenticity margin, respectively. If there is a
device d ∈ DX claiming to represent identity X , such that
d ) > αmin ∧ ∀di ∈ DX , di (cid:54)= d : α(ID X
d ) · αmarg >
α(ID X
α(ID X
di ), accept d as authentic, if also criterion 2 for d
holds. If |DX| = 1, i.e., there is only one device d claiming
the identity X , d is accepted as authentic, if α(ID X
d ) > αmin ,
and criterion 2 holds for it.
Threshold αmin determines the minimal authenticity rat-
ing required for a peer to be considered genuine. Margin
factor αmarg ∈ [0, 1] determines, how much the authenticity
rating of a correct peer has to dominate over the authentic-
ity ratings of all other peers in order for it to be considered
genuine.
The second criterion requires that the key evolution with
a device needs to be attempted at least ρmin times, before
the authenticity rating can be regarded as representative. In
addition, the number of key evolution cycles during which
the key evolution is attempted needs to cover at least a frac-
tion of ρcov of the total key evolution cycles after the initial
pairing. Otherwise, an adversary A in the wearable sce-
nario could just selectively attempt key evolution only when
d1 is in its context and thereby slowly accumulate a high
authenticity rating even though it only occasionally shares
the same context with d1.
Criterion 2
(Confidence). Let ρd denote the num-
ber of key evolution cycles during which device d has at-
tempted key evolution and ρ∗
d the total amount of key evo-
lution cycles since establishing the initial pairing for d . Let
also ρmin ∈ N+ denote a key evolution attempt threshold and
ρcov ∈ [0, 1] a key evolution coverage threshold. The pairing
of a device d is accepted as genuine only if ρd > ρmin and
ρd
ρ∗d
> ρcov .
Once a device d ’s pairing is accepted as genuine, there are
two options: other key chains may be removed and pairing
stopped (e.g., when a smartwatch has found its host smart-
phone), or, the accepting device may continue to evolve pair-
ing keys for other devices (e.g., in the case of smart TV that
can accommodate multiple remote controls).
4. ROBUST CONTEXT FINGERPRINTS
We apply our context ﬁngerprinting method on two diﬀer-
ent contextual modalities: ambient noise and light. As men-
tioned before, the ﬁngerprinting scheme is inspired by Sch¨ur-
mann and Sigg [16], but it is diﬀerent in several ways: The
scheme in [16] requires tight time synchronization, whereas
our scheme does not. Their scheme is intended to extract
enough entropy within a very short time to be used as a
cryptographic key, whereas our ﬁngerprints have a longitu-
dinal orientation. Finally, our scheme is equally applicable
to both audio and luminosity and the ﬁngerprints represent
more sustained changes in the contextual characteristics of
the ambient context over several hours. Thereby, the ﬁn-
gerprints will also capture phenomena originating from the
user’s actions (such as switching on the lights, chatter, si-
lence, etc.). These events are inherently random and there-
fore diﬃcult to predict even for advanced attackers that may
try to utilize proﬁled information about the target context
in attempting to fabricate context ﬁngerprints.
Using a longitudinal approach in ﬁngerprint generation
and key evolution has also the advantage that the scheme
is more robust against attackers that are occasionally co-
located with the paired devices. This is diﬀerent to earlier
approaches, where the security of the pairing is dependent
on the fact that the attacker is not sharing the context with
the paired devices at the time of pairing [20, 16]. Our longi-
tudinal approach, on the other hand, can gracefully handle
situations in which the attacker is occasionally in the same
context with the paired devices, as we will show in Sect. 5.
In our scheme, the devices are continuously monitoring
their context by scanning context snapshots cw(t). Every f
seconds, a snapshot of w seconds is recorded. Each snapshot
consists of a sequence of measurements mi in a particular
contextual modality like ambient luminosity or noise level,
such that cw(t) = (mi, mi+1, . . . , mi+n), where the times-
tamp associated with an individual measurement mi is de-
noted with t(mi), and, t(mi+n) − t(mi) = w. Since the
used snapshot length w is ﬁxed and usually clear from the
context, we omit it in the following and denote a context
snapshot just with c(t) for better readability.
We average the measurements within each context snap-
shot c(t) and denote the snapshot’s average value as
(cid:80)
¯c(t) =
mi∈c(t) mi
|{mi ∈ c(t)}| ,
(2)
where | · | denotes set cardinality.
Based on a sequence of context snapshots C(t, t + nf ) =
(c(t), c(t+f ), c(t+2f ), . . . , c(t+nf )), we calculate its context
ﬁngerprint as a sequence of bits, in which each bit denotes
the change of the snapshot’s average value in comparison
with the previous snapshot’s average. The ﬁngerprint bit
corresponding to a context snapshot is set to “1” if the rel-
ative change between the snapshot’s average value and the
previous snapshot’s average value is larger than a speciﬁed
relative threshold ∆rel and if the diﬀerence between the val-
ues exceeds an absolute threshold value ∆abs. Otherwise,
the bit is “0”.
Definition 2. Let C(t, t + nf ) be a sequence of context
snapshots, i.e., c(ti) ∈ C(t, t + nf ), t  ∆rel ∧ |¯c(ti) − ¯c(ti−f )| > ∆abs
| ¯c(ti)
(cid:40)1,
b(ti) =
0, otherwise.
(3)
Definition 3. We deﬁne the ﬁngerprint φ(C(t, t + nf ))
of a sequence of context snapshots C(t, t+nf ), n∈N+ as
φ(C(t, t + nf )) = (b(t), b(t + f ), . . . , b(t + nf )).
(4)
The rationale for our notion of ﬁngerprints is that two de-
vices that share the same context for an extended period of
time will also experience changes in context parameters in a
similar way. For example, if the user switches on the lights in
a room, the increase in luminosity in the room will be sensed
by all devices located inside the room, whereas other devices
not in the same room will not be able to sense it. There-
fore, bits generated this way will be shared only with the
co-located devices. The same applies to ﬁngerprints based
on audio. The alternating patterns between chatter, silence
and possible other persistent ambient sounds will generate
ﬁngerprint bits in a way that is similar between devices in
the same audio context (e.g., the same room). Devices out-
side the audio context will, however, not be able to sense
these changes.
The same logic applies also to mobile personal devices like
wearables, which are usually always carried together. Even
though the context in which the devices are located may
change as the user moves, the changes will be sensed in a
similar way by both devices.
We will evaluate our ﬁngerprint extraction scheme in both
static and mobile scenarios in Sect. 4.1.
4.1
Implementation and Evaluation
To analyze the feasibility of our approach, we performed
several experiments in diﬀerent contexts investigating, how
similar ﬁngerprints extracted from ambient luminosity and
noise levels are in real contextual settings.
System Set-Up
4.1.1
To simulate the capability of IoT and wearable devices to
sense their ambient context and to use the context infor-
mation for key evolution, we used Android OS smartphones
(Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S and Galaxy S III devices)
running dedicated context data collection software. The col-
lection software on each device continuously measured the
luminosity and noise levels in the device’s context and rou-
tinely sent the collected data to a server for oﬀ-line data
analysis. In these experiments we used a static placement
of the test devices to simulate IoT device pairing scenarios,
whereas for personal wearable pairing scenarios test persons
carried the data collection devices with them.
In both settings, the orientation of the luminosity sensors
of the devices impacts the magnitude of observed luminosity
readings. However, since our method for deriving ﬁngerprint
bits from luminosity readings is not based on absolute lumi-
nosity values, but on relative changes in the ambient illumi-
nation, the exact placement and orientation of the devices
plays only a minor role.
IoT Scenario
4.1.2
In this scenario, we investigated whether IoT devices lo-
cated in the same room can successfully establish similar
enough ﬁngerprints to be used for context-based key evo-
lution. We tested the scenario in diﬀerent set-ups and lo-
cations over several months, varying the placement of the
devices with regard to each other and within the room. Ta-
ble 1 shows one example of the placement of devices in two
settings at two diﬀerent locations: oﬃce and home.
In the oﬃce setting, two devices simulating correct peers
were placed on the wall of an oﬃce room, three meters apart
from each other. Other smartphones simulating wrong peers
were placed in nearby rooms, but without direct visibility
to the room with the correct peers.
In the home setting,
the correct peers were placed in the living room of the test
participant’s house. A smartphone simulating a wrong peer
in a neighboring apartment was placed in another room of
the house, but on a diﬀerent ﬂoor.
To eliminate eﬀects that possible diﬀerences in the orien-
tation of windows of the rooms could have on lighting con-
ditions, we selected rooms that had relatively large windows
facing the same direction, allowing outdoor light to illumi-
nate all rooms used in the experiment in a similar way during
daytime. In addition, to obtain a baseline measurement of

the outdoor lighting conditions that aﬀect the illumination
of the room with the correct peers, we dedicated in each
scenario one device for measuring the direct outdoor light
falling into the room.
Results. We collected luminosity and audio measurements
during the course of several weeks. We extracted context-
based ﬁngerprints based on a time window of w = 120 sec-
onds for each device and compared the average bit diﬀer-
ences of the ﬁngerprints of correct and wrong peers.
In
both settings, hardly any bits were generated during night-
time. We will show in Sect. 5 that ﬁngerprints generated
from nighttime data contain only very little entropy and
can therefore not be used for ﬁngerprint generation. There-
fore, we concentrate our analysis in the oﬃce setting during
business hours between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and in the home
setting during active hours of a household between 6 a.m.
and 10 p.m. The results are shown in Tab. 2.
In the oﬃce setting, the co-located devices clearly show
the largest bit similarity in their respective ﬁngerprints. For
the luminosity data, the diﬀerence between the co-located
devices d1 and d2 and the adversary device A2 in the ad-
jacent oﬃce is relatively small, i.e., only 6.3%. This is so
because the lighting conditions aﬀecting the rooms are al-
most identical and the eﬀect of sunlight dominates the over-
all lighting conditions during business hours1.
For audio, the diﬀerences are clearer. Adversary A2 in the
adjacent oﬃce has only 71.7 % similarity compared to 91.8 %

the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, i.e., the
brightest time in the year. The inﬂuence of sunlight is likely
to be be smaller during other times of the year.
for the co-located devices d1 and d2. This is so, even though
the doors of the rooms in question to a common hallway
were mostly kept open, so that some parts of the acoustic
environment could be shared by the devices in these rooms.
However, adversary device A3 located in the coﬀee room
was farther away, so that it was acoustically more clearly
decoupled from the co-located devices. Therefore the simi-
larity percentage of its ﬁngerprints to the ﬁngerprints of the
co-located devices is signiﬁcantly lower, i.e., 62.6 %.
In the home setting, the results were similar. Here, the
similarity between co-located devices was on the average
82.9 % for luminosity and 87.5 % for audio. There was
also a clear diﬀerence to the adversary devices, which could
only achieve bit similarity values of 70.8 % for luminosity
and 77.0 % for audio ﬁngerprints.
4.1.3 Wearable Device Scenario
In this scenario, we simulated the contextual environment
that typical wearable devices are confronted with. We did
this by equipping test users with smartphones, each playing
the role of a wearable device. We considered two alternative
settings: a ’smart watch’ scenario, in which one device plays
the role of a smart watch, and the other device is used like a
regular smartphone. The other, ’cycling’ scenario, simulates
the use of wearable devices as ﬁtness gadgets.
