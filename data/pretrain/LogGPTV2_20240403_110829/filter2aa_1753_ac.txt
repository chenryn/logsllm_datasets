least one Belarusian journalist is alleged to have “disappeared”.  Strict government controls are 
enforced on all telecommunications technologies.  For example, transceiver satellite antennas and 
IP telephony are both prohibited. 
As in Zimbabwe, the Beltelecom monopoly status is intended not only for government oversight, 
but also for monetary gain.  It is the primary source of revenue for the Ministry of 
Communications (MIC). 
The State Center for Information Security (GCBI), in charge of domestic signals intelligence 
(SIGINT), controls the .by Top Level Domain (TLD), and thus manages both DNS and website 
access in general.  Formerly part of the Belarusian KGB, GCBI also reports directly to the 
President.  Department “K” (for Cyber), within the Ministry of Interior, has the lead in pursuing 
cyber crime.  Internet surveillance mechanisms were reportedly bought from China.  A common 
media crime in Belarus is defaming the “honor and dignity” of state officials. 
Belarus has a long history of Internet-based political battles to examine.  In each of the following 
years, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005, Internet access problems were experienced by websites 
critical of the Belarusian president, state referenda, and elections.  According to the government, 
the problems were due simply to access overload, but the opposition claimed that no one was able 
to get to the sites.  One of the affected sites was characterized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
as “political pornography”. 
The most significant cyber showdown took place during the March 2006 Belarusian presidential 
elections.  The opposition specifically tried to use its youth and computer savvy to organize in 
cyberspace.  The sitting government attempted the same, but because it supporters primarily 
consisted of the rural and elderly its efforts were uphill at best. 
Election day provided the world a case study in modern-day cyber politics.  As Belarusians went 
to the polls, up to 37 opposition media websites were inaccessible from Beltelecom.  “Odd” DNS 
errors were reported, and the presidential challenger’s website was diagnosed as clinically 
“dead”.  One week after President Lukashenka won the election by a wide margin, as anti-
government demonstrators clashed with riot police, the Internet was inaccessible from Minsk 
telephone numbers.  One month later, when an opposition “flash-mob” was organized over 
Internet, attendees were promptly arrested by waiting policemen. 
The history of political cyber warfare in Belarus demonstrates that Internet filtering and 
government surveillance there may not be always be comprehensive, but can be highly focused 
on specific adversaries and at critical points in time. 
# 05  Burma 
Out of a population of almost 50 million, the number of Internet hosts in Burma currently 
reported at 42, and the number of Internet users is 78,000 (about 0.6%).  For the citizen who is 
lucky enough to obtain Internet access, he or she travels not on the World Wide Web but instead 
to the “Myanmar Internet”, which is composed only of a small number of officially sanctioned 
business websites.  The two ISPs are the state Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT), 
and a semi-private firm called Bagan Cybertech (BC).  Foreign companies and embassies are 
allowed to have their own connections.  A few cyber cafés exist, but because they require name, 
identification number, address, and frequent screenshots of user activity, online anonymity is 
virtually unattainable.  Webmail, politics (i.e. Aung San Suu Kyi), anonymizers and pornography 
are all blocked.  Only state-sponsored e-mail accounts are allowed. 
According to the 1996 Computer Science Development Law, all network-ready computers must 
be registered with MPT.  Failure to register a computer and/or sharing an Internet connection can 
earn Burmese citizens up to 15 years in prison.  Burma’s State Peace and Development Council 
(SPDC) prohibits “any criticism of a non-constructive type”, "writings related to politics”, 
“anything detrimental to the ideology of the state”, and “writings directly or indirectly 
detrimental to the current policies and secret security affairs of the government”.  Indeed, 
according to Burmese law, it is fundamentally illegal to have “incorrect ideas”.  
Even after all that, surveys suggest that cost is still the worst part of Internet access.  In Burma, 
the average annual income is $225.  A broadband connection costs $1,300.  The most common 
form of Internet access – dial-up – costs $6 for about 10 hours.  Outside Rangoon and Mandalay, 
long distance fees are required.  Entrance to a cyber café is $1.50. 
There is very little resistance to Burma's Internet governance.  On the international front, Web-
based activist groups such as the Free Burma Coalition and BurmaNet have been organizing on-
line since 1996.  The data filtering company that sold its software to Burma was not keen on 
public knowledge of the sale.  It was reported that after the company denied any knowledge of it, 
a privacy group found a picture on the Web of the Burmese Prime Minister and the company's 
Sales Director, closing the deal. 
# 04  Cuba 
Cuba boasts a highly educated population, but unfortunately less than 2% of its citizens are 
currently able to connect to the Internet.  Without special authorization, private citizens are 
prohibited from buying computers or accessing the Internet.  The Government owns nearly all 
computers on the island.  Even telephone line density is less than 10 per 100 inhabitants, and 
wireless access remains restricted to foreigners and regime elites. 
Cuban Decree-Law 209, written in June, 1996, states that “access from the Republic of Cuba to 
the Global Computer Network” will not violate “moral principles” or “jeopardise national 
security”.  Illegal connections to the Web can earn a prison sentence of 5 years; posting a 
counter-revolutionary article, 20 years.  At least two dozen journalists are now serving up to 27 
years in prison.  It is reported that, as in several other countries in the Exodus Top Ten, Internet 
filtering and surveillance equipment were bought from China. 
A human rights activist, while in Cuba, sent a test email message that contained the names of 
multiple Cuban dissidents.  A pop-up window announced: “This programme will close down in a 
few seconds for state security reasons”, and then her computer crashed.  Further, the 
government’s Internet monitoring program appears to be able to target specific audiences.  At the 
Non-Aligned Movement summit in Havana (Sept 2006), conference attendees reported having no 
problem accessing a wide variety of websites. 
There are reportedly a “few” Correos de Cuba, or state-run Internet cafés.  The cost for 1 hour of 
access is $4.50, or about ½ the average monthly wage of $10.  Use of a state-run email account is 
$1.50 per hour.  As a cheaper method of access, Cubans have borrowed Internet connections from 
expatriates, some of whom have been summoned by the Cuban police and subsequently 
threatened with expulsion from the country. 
In Cuba, Internet connection codes obtained from the government are used to access the Internet 
at certain times of the day.  These codes are now bought and sold on a healthy cyber black 
market.  For Cubans desperate for information from the outside world, these codes can fetch 
extraordinary sums for the impoverished country, up to a dollar a day.  It was reported that 
students have been expelled from school for selling their codes to others, as well as for creating 
illicit chat forums.  Following the incident, there was a video posted to the Web that showed 
university officials announcing their punishment to a school auditorium.  Since buying computer 
equipment in Cuba without government authorization is illegal, there is also a black market for 
computer parts, and prices are said to be “extremely” high. 
# 03  China 
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) possesses the world's most sophisticated Internet 
surveillance system.  It is variously described as ubiquitous, mature, dynamic, precise, and 
effective.  Beijing employs an army of public and private cyber security personnel, has a massive 
legal support system behind it, and can rely on numerous layers of policy and technical control 
mechanisms in order to keep a close eye on its population.  However, due to a relatively freer 
economic system than some other countries in this list, the Middle Kingdom only registers on the 
Exodus Cyber Top Ten at #3. 
While comprehensive laws support government control of traditional media and the Internet, 
individual privacy statutes are unclear, in short supply, and perhaps even inapplicable in terms of 
the information space.  However, it must be said that in Asia, it is generally accepted that there is 
less privacy in one’s daily life, and the general populace is more comfortable with government 
oversight than in the West. 
The PRC not only has strict controls on access to the World Wide Web, but there are policemen 
stationed at cyber cafés, and there is a Chinese “Great Firewall” designed specifically to prevent 
the free flow of information into and out of the country, including, for example, the passing of 
videos of Chinese prison and factory conditions to human rights groups abroad.  By way of 
example, cyber cafés are one of the primary ways that Chinese citizens to access the Internet; the 
cafés are required to track their patrons’ usage for 60 days. 
The “Great Firewall” of China has been credited with providing the country with highly 
sophisticated censorship.  Among the types of information known to be blocked are in politics, 
religion, and pornography.  Activist testing revealed that search results came up short on Taiwan, 
Tibet, Falun Gong, Dalai Lama, and Tiananmen Square.  In the past, Google and the BBC have 
both been blocked wholesale.  Interestingly, sites that are often accessible are major American 
media sites, human rights groups’ pages, and anonymizers.  It is believed that search results are 
blocked by keyword at national gateway, and not by Chinese search engines themselves. 
Western companies, for their part, have been accused of too much cooperation with the 
government in Beijing on cyber control issues.  Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have all 
collaborated with the Communist government in prosecutions.  At least one U.S. congressman 
has termed such cooperation “sickening and evil”, and compared it to the work IBM did for the 
Nazi government during World War II. 
China is now on the cutting edge of world research and development on Internet technologies.  
Exodus worries, however, that Beijing’s emphasis many these – to include IPv6 – is primarily as 
a strategy for population control.  PRC Internet Society chairwoman Hu Qiheng has stated flatly 
that static China’s goal is for the Chinese Internet to achieve a state of “no anonymity”. 
The level of sophistication in Chinese Internet surveillance can be seen by the fact that some 
URLs were reportedly blocked even while their corresponding top level domains (TLD) were 
accessible, even when webpage content appeared consistent across the domain.  In other words, 
the system is likely not being run solely by machines, but by human personnel as well.  Further, it 
was reported that blog entries have not only been denied, but some of them may even have been 
edited, and reposted to the Web! 
In March, 2007, China announced that its Great Firewall had been insufficient to keep out the 
Mongol invaders from cyberspace.  President Hu Jintao called for a “purification” of the Internet, 
and indicated that Beijing would seek to tighten its control over computer networks.  According 
to Hu, new technologies such as blogging and webcasting have allowed Chinese citizens to 
escape government censorship.  Among the cited detrimental effects of the evasion are the 
“development of socialist culture”, the “security of information”, and the “stability of the state”.  
Among the forthcoming initiatives was an announcement that no new cyber cafés would open in 
China this year. 
# 02  Turkmenistan 
President-for-Life Saparmurat Niyazov – the Turkmenbashi, or the Father of All – recently and 
unexpectedly passed away.  While the country is now in a hopeful state of transition, the 
personality cult that Niyazov left behind has Turkmen citizens in a deep hole from which it may 
be difficult to escape.  There is no independent press, and until recently everything written for 
television, newspaper, and radio was some type of hymn or tribute to Niyazov. 
Telecommunications in Turkmenistan remains woefully underdeveloped.  The Turkmentelekom 
monopoly has allowed almost no Internet access into the country whatsoever.  No connections 
from home, and no cyber cafés.  Foreign embassies and non-governmental organizations have 
their own access to the Internet.  While they have in the past offered access to ordinary Turkmen, 
to take advantage of that offer was too dangerous for the average citizen.  There exist only a 
handful of approved websites to a few Turkmen organizations.  In 2001, a count of IT-qualified 
certifications in the former Soviet Union placed Turkmenistan dead last, with only fifty-eight in 
total. 
In 2005, CIA reported that there were only 36,000 Internet users, out of a population of 5 million.  
In 2006, a Turkmen journalist who had dared to work with Radio Free Europe died quickly in 
prison, only three months after being jailed.  Despite repeated European Union (EU) demands, 
there has been no investigation into the incident. 
Following the demise of the Turkmenbashi, elections were held in February, 2007.  Gurbanguli 
Berdymukhamedov won a tightly controlled vote, unmonitored by international observers.  One 
of his campaign promises was that there would be unrestricted access to the Internet. 
Days after the new leader was sworn in, 2 cyber cafés opened in Ashgabat.  Each is equipped 
with 5 computers, 5 desks, and 5 chairs.  One is in the Soviet-style Central Telegraph building, 
the other in a run-down telephone exchange.  The café administrator, Jenet Khudaikulieva, told a 
visiting AP journalist at the Grand Opening that censorship in Turkmenistan was over.  The 
journalist had no problem viewing international news sites, including those belonging to 
Turkmen political opposition groups.  He reported no registration counter and no “visible” 
oversight.  However, the price per hour, $4, is a lot to pay in a country where the average 
monthly income is less than $100.  Indeed, almost no one attended the Grand Opening ceremony. 
Life will hopefully take a turn for the better in Turkmenistan.  On the bright side, reports suggest 
that even though connections to the Internet have been few and far between, computer gaming 
appears quite popular.  Lastly, the use of satellite TV is on the rise, which could also be used to 
improve Internet connectivity. 
# 01  North Korea 
The closest thing on Earth to George Orwell’s 1984 is the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea (DPRK).  NASA currently has better connectivity with Mars than the rest of planet Earth 
has with North Korea, the world's most isolated and repressed country. 
Citizens are taught, however, that North Korea is superior to all other countries; therefore, the 
perceived threat to the nation-state from unrestricted access to the Internet is extraordinarily high.  
Traditional media, including both television and radio, consist of state channels only.  
Reminiscent of the life of Winston Smith, the DPRK has a “national intercom” cable/radio station 
wired throughout the country.  It is a significant source of information for the average North 
Korean citizen, offering both news and commentary, and like the two-way telescreens of 1984 is 
wired into residences and workplaces throughout the country. 
Computers are unavailable in the DPRK.  Even if there were, the price would certainly be out of 
reach in a country where wild animals – and even tree bark – are scare because the citizens are so 
poor and hungry. 
Still, Kim Jong-il, Dear Leader of the DPRK, is reported to be fascinated with the IT revolution.  
In 2000, he gave the visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright his personal email 
address.  Still, it is currently thought that only a small circle of North Korean leadership would 
have unfiltered Internet access.
