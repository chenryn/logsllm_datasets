### Belarus
At least one Belarusian journalist is alleged to have "disappeared." The government enforces strict controls over all telecommunications technologies, including the prohibition of transceiver satellite antennas and IP telephony.

Similar to Zimbabwe, the monopoly status of Beltelecom serves not only for government oversight but also as a significant revenue source for the Ministry of Communications (MIC).

The State Center for Information Security (GCBI), responsible for domestic signals intelligence (SIGINT), manages the .by Top Level Domain (TLD) and controls both DNS and website access. Formerly part of the Belarusian KGB, GCBI reports directly to the President. The Cyber Department (Department "K") within the Ministry of Interior leads the efforts against cybercrime. Reports indicate that internet surveillance mechanisms were purchased from China. A common media crime in Belarus is defaming the "honor and dignity" of state officials.

Belarus has a history of internet-based political conflicts. In 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005, websites critical of the president, state referenda, and elections experienced access issues. The government attributed these problems to network overload, but the opposition claimed deliberate blocking. One of the affected sites was labeled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as "political pornography."

The most significant cyber conflict occurred during the March 2006 presidential elections. The opposition, leveraging youth and computer skills, organized online, while the government, with its base in rural and elderly populations, struggled to do the same. On election day, up to 37 opposition media websites were inaccessible via Beltelecom. DNS errors and the presidential challenger's "dead" website were reported. A week after President Lukashenka's victory, internet access was cut off in Minsk during anti-government protests. A month later, an opposition-organized flash mob resulted in arrests by waiting police.

This history shows that while internet filtering and government surveillance in Belarus may not be comprehensive, they are highly focused on specific adversaries at critical times.

### Burma
Burma, with a population of almost 50 million, has only 42 internet hosts and 78,000 internet users (about 0.6%). Internet access, if obtained, is limited to the "Myanmar Internet," consisting of a few officially sanctioned business websites. The two ISPs are the state-run Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) and the semi-private Bagan Cybertech (BC). Foreign companies and embassies have their own connections. Cyber cafés exist but require extensive personal information, making anonymity nearly impossible. Webmail, political content, anonymizers, and pornography are blocked. Only state-sponsored email accounts are allowed.

Under the 1996 Computer Science Development Law, all network-ready computers must be registered with MPT. Failure to register or sharing an internet connection can result in up to 15 years in prison. The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) prohibits any non-constructive criticism, political writings, and anything detrimental to state ideology or policies. Having "incorrect ideas" is fundamentally illegal.

Despite these restrictions, cost remains a major barrier. The average annual income is $225, while a broadband connection costs $1,300. Dial-up, the most common form of access, costs $6 for about 10 hours. Outside Rangoon and Mandalay, long-distance fees apply, and cyber café entry costs $1.50.

Resistance to internet governance is minimal. International activist groups like the Free Burma Coalition and BurmaNet have been organizing online since 1996. A data filtering company that sold software to Burma initially denied the sale, but a photo of the Burmese Prime Minister and the company's Sales Director closing the deal surfaced.

### Cuba
Cuba, despite having a highly educated population, has less than 2% of its citizens connected to the internet. Private citizens need special authorization to buy computers or access the internet. The government owns most computers, and telephone line density is low. Wireless access is restricted to foreigners and regime elites.

Decree-Law 209, enacted in June 1996, states that internet access must not violate "moral principles" or "jeopardize national security." Unauthorized internet connections can lead to a five-year prison sentence, while posting counter-revolutionary articles can result in 20 years. At least two dozen journalists are serving up to 27 years in prison. Internet filtering and surveillance equipment were reportedly bought from China.

A human rights activist in Cuba sent a test email containing the names of Cuban dissidents, resulting in a pop-up message and a system crash. The government's internet monitoring appears to target specific audiences. During the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Havana (September 2006), attendees had no trouble accessing various websites.

There are a few state-run internet cafés, costing $4.50 per hour, which is half the average monthly wage of $10. State-run email accounts cost $1.50 per hour. Cubans sometimes borrow internet connections from expatriates, who risk expulsion. Internet connection codes, issued by the government, are bought and sold on a black market, fetching high prices. Students have been expelled for selling these codes and creating illicit chat forums. There is also a black market for computer parts, with extremely high prices.

### China
China has the world's most sophisticated internet surveillance system, described as ubiquitous, mature, dynamic, precise, and effective. Beijing employs a large number of public and private cybersecurity personnel, supported by extensive legal frameworks and technical control mechanisms. Despite a relatively freer economic system, China ranks #3 on the Exodus Cyber Top Ten.

While laws support government control of traditional media and the internet, individual privacy statutes are unclear and possibly inapplicable. However, in Asia, there is generally less expectation of privacy, and the populace is more accepting of government oversight.

China strictly controls internet access, with policemen stationed at cyber cafés and a "Great Firewall" preventing the free flow of information. Cyber cafés, a primary means of internet access, are required to track patrons' usage for 60 days. The "Great Firewall" blocks political, religious, and pornographic content, as well as specific search results related to Taiwan, Tibet, Falun Gong, Dalai Lama, and Tiananmen Square. Major American media sites, human rights groups, and anonymizers are often accessible, suggesting that censorship is keyword-based at national gateways.

Western companies like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have been accused of cooperating with the Chinese government in prosecutions. Some U.S. congressmen have criticized this cooperation, comparing it to IBM's work for the Nazi government during World War II.

China is at the forefront of internet technology research and development, but there are concerns that advancements, such as IPv6, are primarily aimed at population control. The chairwoman of the PRC Internet Society, Hu Qiheng, stated that China aims for a "no anonymity" internet.

Chinese internet surveillance is highly sophisticated, with some URLs blocked even when their top-level domains (TLDs) are accessible. This suggests human involvement in the censorship process. Reports also indicate that blog entries have been edited and reposted.

In March 2007, President Hu Jintao called for a "purification" of the internet, citing new technologies like blogging and webcasting as allowing citizens to evade censorship. He emphasized the need to protect socialist culture, information security, and state stability. New cyber cafés will not open in 2007.

### Turkmenistan
Turkmenistan recently underwent a transition following the unexpected death of President-for-Life Saparmurat Niyazov, known as the Turkmenbashi. The country lacks independent press, and until recently, all media content was devoted to Niyazov.

Telecommunications are underdeveloped, with the Turkmentelekom monopoly allowing minimal internet access. There are no home connections or cyber cafés, except for foreign embassies and NGOs, which occasionally offer access at great risk to ordinary citizens. Only a few approved websites are available. In 2001, Turkmenistan had the lowest number of IT-qualified certifications in the former Soviet Union, with just 58.

In 2005, the CIA reported 36,000 internet users out of a population of 5 million. In 2006, a Turkmen journalist working with Radio Free Europe died in prison three months after being jailed, with no investigation into the incident.

Following Niyazov's death, Gurbanguli Berdymukhamedov won a tightly controlled election in February 2007, promising unrestricted internet access. Two cyber cafés opened in Ashgabat, each with five computers, desks, and chairs. An AP journalist confirmed no visible oversight but noted the high cost ($4 per hour) in a country where the average monthly income is less than $100.

While life may improve, computer gaming is popular, and satellite TV use is increasing, potentially improving internet connectivity.

### North Korea
North Korea, often compared to George Orwell's 1984, is the world's most isolated and repressed country. NASA has better connectivity with Mars than Earth has with North Korea.

Citizens are taught that North Korea is superior, making unrestricted internet access a perceived threat. Traditional media, including television and radio, are state-controlled. A "national intercom" cable/radio station provides news and commentary, similar to the telescreens in 1984.

Computers are unavailable, and even if they were, the cost would be prohibitive in a country where citizens are so poor that wild animals and tree bark are scarce. Despite this, Kim Jong-il, the Dear Leader, was fascinated by the IT revolution. In 2000, he gave his personal email address to visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. It is believed that only a small circle of North Korean leadership has unfiltered internet access.
