paper, but we note that it is effectively serving as a second
Internet voting platform, with broadly similar risks to Omni-
Ballot’s online return mode, including a reliance on large tech
companies for trusted infrastructure. Egress appears to be
hosted in Microsoft’s cloud and to store encrypted messages
in Amazon S3 servers located in the U.K. Routing domes-
tic voters’ ballots through a foreign jurisdiction may weaken
the legal protections surrounding ballot secrecy and exposes
voters to a greater risk of surveillance or other attacks by a
foreign government [13].
Depending on the voter’s existing email provider, Egress
Switch may offer privacy advantages, particularly as the
sender may only view sent messages for a limited time. On
the other hand, it centralizes voted ballots on a single third-
party platform, which must be trusted to deliver them without
modiﬁcation. As with OmniBallot, Switch itself, and the
third-parties it trusts, can see and change the ballot before it
is delivered, and there is no apparent mechanism by which
voters can independently conﬁrm that their voted ballots have
been received by election ofﬁcials without modiﬁcation.
4.5 Risks to Voters’ Privacy
OmniBallot has access to a large amount of privacy-sensitive
data (see Table 2): voters’ names, addresses, dates of birth,
party afﬁliations, and other voter registration ﬁelds; their
coarse physical locations from their IP addresses; their partial
3086    30th USENIX Security Symposium

social security numbers; and, in either the ballot marking or
online voting conﬁgurations, their actual ballot selections.
In addition, when votes are cast online, OmniBallot’s
client-side code takes a ﬁngerprint of the browser and sends
it to the server with the voter’s registration data and ballot
selections. If Democracy Live shared this data with other
sites, they could recognize the voter’s browser and associate
it with their identity and votes. Browser ﬁngerprints are
incredibly privacy invasive [22]—they can uniquely track
a browser even after the user has taken defensive measures
such as clearing cookies, as well as between private browsing
and normal browser modes [66].
This data about the voter would be valuable to many par-
ties: advertisers, political candidates, or attackers seeking
to conduct disinformation campaigns. Notably, Democracy
Live appears to be silent about whether, or for how long, they
store this data, how they use it, or whether it will be shared or
sold to third parties. Prior to our work, OmniBallot included
no terms of service or privacy policy (though it did link to
Google’s, as sites that use reCAPTCHA are required to do).
OmniBallot also makes extensive use of ﬁrst- and third-
party tracking mechanisms to monitor voters’ interactions
with the platform.
It sends Google Analytics extensive
browser conﬁguration information, the URLs of pages the
voter visits within the app, whether they are a UOCAVA voter,
and the voter’s ID number. In Delaware, the same ID number
is used in the state’s publicly available voter ﬁle, where it is
associated with the voter’s full name, address, phone number,
birth year, and party. Google could use the ID ﬁeld to person-
ally identify the voter and potentially to associate the voter’s
identify with other tracking cookies.4
4.6 Risk Summary
Below, we brieﬂy summarize our ﬁndings concerning Omni-
Ballot’s three main modes of operation. Our assessment of
their relative risk accords with recent guidance by the U.S.
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency [58, 63].
Blank ballot delivery. When OmniBallot is used to deliver
blank ballots for printing, attackers could modify certain vot-
ers’ ballots or return instructions to omit candidates, cause
votes to be scanned incorrectly, or delay or misdirect mail-in
returns. These risks can be largely mitigated with rigorous
election procedures, and, with such protections in place, we
consider the overall risk to be moderate.
Online ballot marking. Using OmniBallot to mark and
print ballots carries greater risks. Attackers can learn the
voter’s selections and target ballots for a disfavored candidate
by misdirecting them or causing them to be scanned as
a vote for somebody else. Attackers could also mark the

of service [28], which prohibit sending personally identiﬁable information to
Google.
ballot for different candidates than the voter intended, which,
although visible, many voters would likely fail to detect.
Voter education and procedural defenses can only mitigate
these attacks to an extent, so we consider the risk to be high.
As the risk further increases when online marking is widely
used, we recommend limiting its deployment.
Online ballot return. When ballots are returned over the In-
ternet using OmniBallot, there is no way for voters to conﬁrm
that their votes have been transmitted without modiﬁcation,
and attackers could change votes in ways that would be difﬁ-
cult for voters, ofﬁcials, or Democracy Live to detect. Attacks
could be conducted through client-side malware, compromise
of third-party services such as Amazon and Google, or in-
ﬁltration of Democracy Live. Administrative controls and
audits cannot prevent such attacks. Given the possibility for
undetected changes to election results, we consider the risks
of online voting to be severe.
5 Recommendations
Based on our analysis, we offer a series of recommendations
for election administrators, policymakers, and Democracy
Live in order to help protect the integrity of elections con-
ducted using OmniBallot and safeguard voters’ privacy. These
are in addition to the procedural defenses discussed in § 4.
Many of these recommendations apply more generally to all
systems for online voting or ballot delivery and marking that
jurisdictions may be using or considering.
We conveyed these recommendations and a summary of our
ﬁndings to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, which communicated them to state ofﬁcials, and we
discussed them with Democracy Live’s management team. In
response, Democracy Live made some limited improvements,
such as adding a privacy policy. Delaware and New Jersey
discontinued use of OmniBallot for online voting [49], but
Delaware continued to allow webmail-based ballot return.
Eliminate electronic ballot return. OmniBallot’s online
ballot return functions run counter to the clear scientiﬁc con-
sensus, as expressed by the National Academies [41], that the
Internet should not be used for the return of marked ballots.
Our analysis shows that votes cast online using OmniBallot
could be surreptitiously changed without voters, ofﬁcials, or
Democracy Live being able to detect the attack. Given the
risks, we recommend that elections administrators refrain
from using online ballot return, including ballot return via
email. Instead, administrators should focus on improving the
efﬁciency and accessibility of physical ballot return paths,
which carry fewer risks of large-scale manipulation.
Limit the use of online ballot marking.
In the ideal case,
online ballot marking provides valuable usability and acces-
sibility beneﬁts. For absentee voters with disabilities that
make it impossible to mark ballots by hand, such a tool could
provide greater independence and privacy. At the same time,
USENIX Association

it carries higher risks of ballot misdirection, manipulation,
and mismarking than blank ballot delivery, and research with
ballot-marking devices suggests that most voters will fail to
spot altered ballots, even if prompted to check [10]. As online
marking becomes used more widely, it becomes a more at-
tractive target, and the risk that attacks could change election
outcomes increases rapidly. For these reasons, we recom-
mend offering online marking only to voters who could not
otherwise mark a ballot independently, and not to the general
public. Furthermore, marked ballots should always be printed
and physically returned.
Mark ballots using client-side code. OmniBallot’s design,
as used in Delaware, creates unnecessary risks to ballot se-
crecy and integrity by sending the voters’ selections, coupled
with their identities, to an online service when generating
marked ballots. These risks could be avoided by marking
ballots locally in the browser, using client-side code.
Democracy Live already offers an option to do this. Om-
niBallot deployments in California, Virginia counties, and
Washington, D.C. use an alternative online marking approach
called “Secure Select,” in which marked ballots are generated
without sending selections to a server [50]. After download-
ing the return package, the voter is redirected to a page on
ss.liveballot.com, which delivers JavaScript for generat-
ing the marked ballot entirely within the browser.
In addition to Delaware, jurisdictions in Colorado, Florida,
Ohio, Oregon, Washington State, and West Virginia appear to
use the more dangerous server-side marking mechanism. We
recommend that they switch to client-side marking.
Implement risk-limiting audits. When OmniBallot is used
to deliver blank ballots that are marked by hand and physi-
cally returned, this generates a strongly voter-veriﬁed record
of voters’ choices. However, attackers can still manipulate
the ballot design in ways that would cause votes to be mis-
counted when tabulated by an optical scanner. To mitigate
this, we recommend that ofﬁcials perform risk-limiting audits
(RLAs) [36], which limit the probability that the election out-
come differs from the outcome that would be found by a full
hand-count. As with in-person voting, RLAs are an essential
defense against error and fraud.
Reduce unnecessary trust in third parties. OmniBallot’s
security depends not only on the security of Democracy Live’s
code and procedures, but also on the security of services pro-
vided by Amazon, Google, and Cloudﬂare. Attackers that
breach their systems (or rogue employees within the compa-
nies) could alter votes that are returned electronically. Democ-
racy Live can reduce this risk, to an extent, by removing
inessential dependencies (e.g., Google Analytics) and apply-
ing subresource integrity [3] to static libraries (e.g., PDF.js).
However, eliminating all reliance on third-party may be inad-
visable, as it is difﬁcult, if not impossible, for a small company
like Democracy Live to deliver the same level of infrastructure
security and resilience as a leading cloud provider.
Figure 4: Misleading statements about online voting. The
Delaware app stated that, “No votes are cast online under any circum-
stances.” In fact, both email and electronic return cast the ballot over
the Internet. Such mischaracterizations make it harder for voters to
understand the risks of their selected return path.
Require a privacy policy. Despite having access to a wide
range of sensitive personally identiﬁable information, Omni-
Ballot had no privacy policy, leaving voters uniformed about
what legal limitations, if any, restrict the company’s use of
this data. For example, it remains unclear whether the com-
pany could legally share such data with political campaigns,
law enforcement, foreign governments, or ad tech companies.
Moreover, due to OmniBallot’s reliance on third-party ser-
vices, Amazon and Google store or receive some or all of
this data. Statutory requirements, Democracy Live’s contracts
with third parties, and contractual obligations to election ju-
risdictions may offer some legal protections, but these are
largely invisible to voters.
At our recommendation, Democracy Live recently posted
a privacy policy that covers all OmniBallot instances and
prohibits the company from using voters’ information for any
purpose unrelated to servicing their ballots [18]. However, the
policy does not provide explicit limits and guarantees about
the retention, protection, and disposal of this data.
Increase transparency and facilitate independent review.
Transparency and independent technical analysis are impor-
tant for ensuring that election software is as secure as possible
and for helping ofﬁcials and the public understand the tech-
nology’s risks. Yet Democracy Live and Delaware have made
accurate public understanding of these risks more difﬁcult
through misleading statements as to whether OmniBallot is
a form of online voting (e.g., Figure 4), and ours is the ﬁrst
public, independent security analysis of the software.
Unlike in-person voting equipment, which is tested by fed-
erally accredited labs for compliance with the EAC’s Volun-
tary Voting System Guidelines [60], there are no federal stan-
dards or certiﬁcation processes for platforms like OmniBallot.
This means local and state ofﬁcials are largely dependent on
3088    30th USENIX Security Symposium

the vendors themselves when assessing such products. Ofﬁ-
cials should insist that systems like OmniBallot be subjected
to public examination by independent security experts be-
fore considering them for use. Such evaluation has exposed
critical vulnerabilities in Internet voting systems in the past
(e.g., [29, 65]), preventing ﬂawed technologies from putting
elections at risk. That OmniBallot has been used before with-
out reported problems—predominately for small populations
and for low-risk blank-ballot delivery—does not establish that
it can be used safely for online voting or with large numbers
of voters in high-stakes elections.
To facilitate independent analysis, we recommend that
Democracy Live adopt a vulnerability disclosure policy that
follows best practices, such as NTIA’s CVD policy tem-
plate [44], and make OmniBallot’s source code available for
scrutiny. The company’s reporting guidelines at the time of
our analysis (Fig. 5) prohibited further disclosure of reported
problems without their permission. After we made our ﬁnd-
ings public, they adopted a new policy [14] modeled after
Disclose.io’s CVD template [19]. The new policy permits
disclosure post-mitigation, but there are no set timelines nor
any apparent recourse if the company excessively delays or
chooses not to ﬁx a problem. These policies may discourage
responsible disclosure and could prevent researchers from
alerting ofﬁcials or the public about ﬂaws that go unﬁxed.
It is notable that ours is the fourth security analysis of
a deployed Internet voting system in less than year to ﬁnd
signiﬁcant risks to election integrity [26, 29, 51]. In each of
these cases, the researchers were presented with nontrivial
barriers to analysis, ranging from incomplete documentation
and lack of source code availability to restrictive vulnerability
disclosure policies. This trend points to the possibility that
current market incentives do not favor security or transparency
for such systems. Our work should serve as further evidence to
policymakers that regulatory intervention may be necessary.
6 Conclusions
Elections administrators have the complicated job of ensur-
ing that all eligible voters have the ability to vote, while si-
multaneously safeguarding against some of the world’s most
sophisticated attackers. Some voters, including those with
certain disabilities and some overseas servicemembers, have
long faced signiﬁcant obstacles to participation. Now, with
the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, all voters may
need better options for voting safely.
We ﬁnd that OmniBallot’s ballot delivery and marking
modes have the potential to be valuable tools for helping
voters participate, if used with speciﬁc precautions and
changes. Blank ballot delivery, when used to print ballots,
mark them by hand, and return them physically, appears to
have only moderate risks if the precautions we recommend
are applied, and it can cut in half the round-trip time of voting
by mail. Online marking of vote-by-mail ballots is riskier,
Figure 5: Democracy Live’s vulnerability reporting guidelines
stipulated that researchers who reported problems could not further
disclose them without permission. Although it is unclear if this
policy is enforceable, such restrictions run counter to best practices
and may chill responsible disclosure.
especially when widely used, and marking ballots server-side
adds additional, unnecessary risks. However, with client-side
marking and the procedural defenses we propose, the risks
can be reduced to a level that may be acceptable for voters
who otherwise could not mark a ballot independently. Our
suggested changes would not impede accessibility and would
result in greater protection for these voters.
Online ballot return, however, represents a severe danger to
election integrity and voter privacy. At worst, attackers could
change election outcomes without detection, and even if there
was no attack, ofﬁcials would have no way to prove that the
results were accurate. No available technology can adequately
mitigate these risks [41], so we urge jurisdictions not to deploy
OmniBallot’s online voting capabilities or similar systems.
In response to our ﬁndings, Delaware and New Jersey an-
nounced that they would halt use of OmniBallot [49] for
online return, though Delaware continued allowing online
voting using the Egress Switch webmail service, which is
not necessarily more secure. Meanwhile, 19 states allow at
least some voters to return ballots via email, fax, or a web
