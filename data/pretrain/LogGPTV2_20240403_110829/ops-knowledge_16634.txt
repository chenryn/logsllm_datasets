Question: An IT security manager is considering the implications of enabling or disabling FileVault on Mac computers with Apple silicon in the organization. They are discussing with the team what the outcomes would be in terms of security for internal storage devices based on their operational mode. Which of the following statements accurately describe the security implications of FileVault's status?
"A": "With FileVault turned on, the volume encryption key is wrapped with the class key and protected by the user's password and the hardware UID.",
"B": "When FileVault is turned off, the volume encryption key is left unprotected and sensitive data is at risk if the storage device is compromised.",
"C": "If FileVault is enabled after the initial setup, an anti-replay mechanism prevents the old key from decrypting the volume, enhancing security.",
"D": "Disabling FileVault renders the internal storage data permanently inaccessible as the Secure Enclave erases all cryptographic keys."
