### Urban/Metropolitan Area B-37
**January 2007**
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Advanced Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

#### Governance: Advanced Implementation
The area has made significant progress in establishing communications interoperability as a regional priority. The governance structure includes a Governance Board and a Technology Steering Committee, which involve local public safety, state, and federal agencies. Formal and active agreements, including the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), are in place and signed by all participating organizations. However, a formal strategic plan focused on interoperable communications is still lacking.

**Recommendations:**
- Develop a strategic plan beyond the operational focus of the TICP, with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Intermediate Implementation
The area is in the earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures. This was evident during the exercise, where there were difficulties in following command and control procedures, such as multiple incident commanders and challenges in identifying the Communications Unit Leader (COML).

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to maintain, review, and update SOPs, and disseminate them to all included organizations.
- Ensure that regional SOPs are aligned with those documented in statewide operations plans.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
The area uses shared channels and systems (e.g., Nashville 800 MHz system) on a daily basis and demonstrated proficiency during the TICP validation exercise. Gateways and radio caches are available for agencies with disparate systems, and both methods were successfully used during the exercise. However, state and federal participation in the validation exercise was minimal.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to exercise and train on applicable means of communications interoperability to improve familiarity of use.
- Involve state and federal agencies (e.g., Tennessee Department of Health, Department of Transportation) in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

#### Technology Overview
Four shared systems are in use in the greater Nashville area, including two 800 MHz trunked systems and two VHF systems. Various VHF, UHF, 700 MHz, and 800 MHz mutual aid channels are also available. Many gateways and consoles are available for patching, though the area prefers to use patches as a last resort. The TICP is the basis for a coordinated approach to interoperability communications, with future funding coordinated through the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA).

### Salt Lake City (Utah)
**January 2007**
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Advanced Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

#### Governance: Advanced Implementation
The Utah Wireless Integrated Network (UWIN) has been successful in establishing communications interoperability as a regional priority. UWIN, established by executive order in November 2003, includes a Governance Board and a Technology Steering Committee. Formal and active agreements, including the TICP, are in place and signed by all participating organizations. While strategic goals have been established, a formal strategic plan focused on interoperable communications is still needed.

**Recommendations:**
- Develop a strategic plan beyond the operational focus of the TICP, with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Intermediate Implementation
The TICP provided the first formal regional interoperable communications SOPs. The area has participated in additional training focused on SOPs and has disseminated these policies to public safety agencies within the area, including dispatch centers. However, there was confusion with communications unit roles and responsibilities during the exercise.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue efforts to implement SOPs as formalized through the TICP.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
Most public safety agencies in the area use the existing regional shared system (UCAN) as their primary communications system. The exercise indicated that participants are accustomed to working together and can demonstrate proficiency in using interoperable communications when needed. However, consistent use of gateways was not demonstrated, and the deployment of radio caches was not practiced.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly train, test, and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources (e.g., gateways) to improve proficiency.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component for all future exercises.

#### Technology Overview
The UCAN provides Motorola® 800 MHz SmartZone™ infrastructure in the Salt Lake City area. Virtually all public safety agencies use UCAN as their primary communications system, with some exceptions. The State of Utah owns and operates Motorola Omni-Link infrastructure, enabling interagency connectivity between UCAN and other communications resources. The UCAN is focusing on re-banding, which includes replacing and reprogramming radios and retuning infrastructure. The UWIN Technology Steering Committee is also addressing an initiative for a broadband wireless pilot.

### Northeast Quadrant (Vermont)
**January 2007**
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Established Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Intermediate Implementation
- **Usage:** Intermediate Implementation

#### Governance: Established Implementation
There is demonstrated political and fiscal leadership in the area, with a strong push toward statewide interoperability. Funding is a priority, but it is currently based on federal grants, and there is no long-term regional funding plan for recurring expenses. The Vermont Communications Committee (VCOMM) established the Regional Interoperable Communications Committee (RICC) in March 2006 to create the TICP. The RICC includes local, state, and federal representation and has both a technical and an operations working group. Formal partnerships exist, but the agreements have not yet been put into practice.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure that all applicable local, state, and federal agencies (and international border interoperable communications efforts as applicable) are involved in the decision-making group and define roles and responsibilities as part of the group.
- Document and formalize agreements (e.g., MOUs) among all participating agencies to achieve regional communications interoperability.
- Continue to work toward approval, adoption, and acceptance of the regional strategic plan.
- Clarify the relationship between the regional and statewide strategic planning efforts.
- Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan, with consideration for funding models (in addition to grants) that can leverage local, regional, and statewide strategic planning efforts.
- Continue to broaden and champion a governance structure that would more fully support regional interoperability.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Intermediate Implementation
The TICP provides the first regional communications SOPs for the Northeast Quadrant. The plan is still under development and will be formalized and disseminated to participating agencies in fiscal year 2007. NIMS/ICS is a high priority, but recent implementation indicates lower responder familiarity with command and control SOPs.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all regional interoperability SOPs are incorporated into the TICP and distributed to participating agencies.
- Regularly practice SOPs to increase proficiency in their use (e.g., gateway SOPs).
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Intermediate Implementation
There is little need for interoperable communications in the area, and the equipment is not regularly used. During the TICP validation exercise, participants were successful in using shared channels and gateways for interoperability, and amateur radios were used for backup communications.

**Recommendations:**
- Regularly test and exercise deployment of all applicable regional interoperability resources, including gateways and shared channels, to improve proficiency.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

#### Technology Overview
The Northeast Quadrant has limited interoperability options, with no shared systems or available cache radios. Interoperability could be established through shared channels, although not all agencies have access to these channels. Alternatively, interoperability could be enabled using console patches at dispatch centers or by using mobile gateways. Long-term goals include expanding the number of radio channels available and incorporating data communications for the first responder community.

**January 2007**
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard**

#### Summary
- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

#### Governance: Intermediate Implementation
The State of West Virginia has taken the lead in developing the West Virginia Incident Response Plan (WVIRP), and a multidiscipline governing board oversees this statewide effort. The Tri-County Region was part of the first implementation phase of the WVIRP radio system. Informal agreements are in place to ensure interoperability, but a strategic plan for the Tri-County area is unclear. Funding is currently based on federal grants, and there is no long-term regional funding plan for recurring expenses.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to participate in statewide planning committee efforts and support multi-state interoperability efforts.
- Document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating agencies to achieve regional interoperability.
- Develop and implement a strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP), with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance.
- Ensure that all public safety entities are included in a strategic plan (e.g., clarify whether Monongalia fire service is involved).
- Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.
- Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan, considering funding models (in addition to grants) that can leverage local, regional, and statewide strategic planning efforts.
- Continue to broaden and champion a governance structure that would more fully support regional interoperability.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Established Implementation
The Tri-County area’s TICP incorporates policies and procedures for the use of the state’s new West Virginia Interoperability Radio Project (WVIRP) P25 system. These policies have been disseminated to all included agencies and regional dispatch centers. The TICP validation exercise demonstrated successful interoperable communications through the shared system and console patching. West Virginia began implementing NIMS less than one year ago, and while still a new process, NIMS/ICS was demonstrated during the exercise with only minor problems.

**Recommendations:**
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
The area uses shared channels and systems on a daily basis and demonstrated proficiency during the TICP validation exercise. Gateways and radio caches are available for agencies with disparate systems, and both methods were successfully used during the exercise. However, state and federal participation in the validation exercise was minimal.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue to exercise and train on applicable means of communications interoperability to improve familiarity of use.
- Involve state and federal agencies (e.g., Tennessee Department of Health, Department of Transportation) in training and exercises.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

#### Technology Overview
The Tri-County area uses the WVIRP P25 system, which was developed under a DHS Interoperable Communications Equipment grant. The area has four PSAPs, which perform various services for law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services. The existing network will be expanded to assist selected communities with core coverage needs and to include data communications for the first responder community when funding is available.
