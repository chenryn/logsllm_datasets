earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.  This fact could be confirmed based on 
the degree of difficulty the area faced in following command and control procedures in its exercise (e.g., 
multiple incident commanders, difficulty identifying the Communications Unit Leader [COML]).  This 
should be a focus for continued training and exercise.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to maintain, review, and update SOPs, and disseminate to all included organizations 
• 
Ensure that regional SOPs are aligned with those documented in statewide operations plans 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP)  to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The area uses shared channels and shared system (Nashville 800 megahertz [MHz] system) on a daily basis 
and demonstrated proficiency in this area during the TICP validation exercise.  Gateways and radio caches 
are available for agencies with disparate systems, and both methods were successfully used during the 
exercise.  Despite the active participation of the state in TICP development, there was little state or federal 
participation in the validation exercise.  The area is encouraged to build on its successful exercise and further 
integrate State, Federal, and support agencies in future tests.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to exercise and train on applicable means of communications interoperability to improve 
familiarity of use 
• 
Involve state and federal agencies (e.g., Tennessee Department of Health, Department of Transportation) 
in training and exercises 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Four shared systems are in use in the greater Nashville area, including two 800 MHz trunked systems and two very high 
frequency (VHF) systems.  There are also various VHF, ultra high frequency (UHF), 700 MHz, and 800 MHz mutual 
aid channels in the area.  Many gateways and consoles are available for patching; however, the Nashville area prefers to 
use patches as a last resort.  The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) assumes that the TICP will be 
expanded to include counties surrounding the Nashville area.  The TICP is the basis for a coordinated approach to 
interoperability communications in the area; however, future funding will be coordinated through TEMA.  Coordination 
with TEMA will ensure that TICP radio equipment purchases by independent jurisdictions are managed properly.

Utah has designated Salt Lake City as its metropolitan area (area), which includes all cities, townships, and 
jurisdictions within Salt Lake County. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
The Utah Wireless Integrated Network (UWIN) is successful in establishing communications interoperability 
as a regional priority.  The UWIN, a wireless intergovernmental network that will leverage existing state 
resources (e.g., Utah Communications Agency Network [UCAN]), was established by executive order of the 
governor in November 2003.  Within UWIN, there is a Governance Board and a Technology Steering 
Committee that include the local public safety, state, and federal agencies.  The area should be commended 
for having formal and active agreements that facilitate interoperability (including the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan [TICP]) that are signed by all included organizations and reviewed after every update.  
While strategic goals have been established through the UWIN, the area appears to lack a formal strategic 
plan focused on interoperable communications.  Despite the apparent lack of a strategic plan, Salt Lake City 
should be commended as a model for how its budget and communications equipment procurement decisions 
are made with consideration for regional interoperability, including covering recurring costs (operations and 
maintenance).  The area has also demonstrated a successful long-term funding strategy for the 
implementation of the UCAN system. Based on the activities of the governor in creating UWIN and the 
subsequent actions of the group, it appears that there is strong local, regional, and state support for 
interoperable communications in Salt Lake City. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Develop a strategic plan beyond the operational focus of the TICP, with participant approval, adoption, 
and acceptance

The TICP provided the area with the first formal regional interoperable communications SOPs. The area 
participated in additional training focused on SOPs, and has taken further steps to disseminate these policies 
to public safety agencies within the area, including to dispatch centers.  With the recent adoption of the 
TICP, the area has begun implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident 
Command System (ICS) to fire, law enforcement, and emergency medical service agencies.  While the area 
indicated that both equipment SOPs and NIMS/ICS procedures have not been formally adopted, the exercise 
reflected proficiency in execution of the practices.  However, it was noted in the After Action Report (AAR) 
that there was confusion with communications unit  roles and responsibilities during the event.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue efforts to implement SOPs as formalized through the TICP

Most of the public safety agencies in the area use the existing regional shared system (UCAN) as their 
primary communications system. The AAR indicates that area’s participants are accustomed to working 
together as a team and are able to demonstrate proficiency in using interoperable communications when 
needed. While patches were used effectively in some areas of the exercises, consistent use of gateways was 
not demonstrated in the exercise. In addition, although several large area agencies operate radio caches, their 
deployment was not practiced during the TICP validation exercise.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly train, test, and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources (e.g., gateway) to 
improve proficiency 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as component for all future exercises

The UCAN provides Motorola® 800 megahertz (MHz) SmartZone™ infrastructure in the Salt Lake City area.  
Virtually all public safety agencies in the area use UCAN as their primary communications system.  The only 
exceptions are Salt Lake City, which operates a Motorola SmartZone 800 MHz Specialized Mobile Radio system within 
its jurisdictional boundary, and Murray City, which operates a conventional 800 MHz network within its jurisdictional 
boundary.  The State of Utah owns and operates Motorola Omni-Link infrastructure in the Salt Lake area that enables 
interagency connectivity between UCAN, Salt Lake City, and other communications resources.  
The UCAN near-term focus appears to be on re-banding, which includes replacing some radios, reprogramming many 
(i.e., 15,500) radios, retuning infrastructure (60 sites and 26 standalone repeaters).  The UCAN, along with Motorola 
Omni-Link infrastructure, will provide additional dispatch center patches statewide.  This type of interoperability will 
also be used for future mutual-aid solutions.  The UWIN Technology Steering Committee is also addressing an 
initiative for a broadband wireless pilot and a request for proposals that could lead to interoperable broadband 
communications in the more distant future.

There is demonstrated political and fiscal leadership in the area with a strong push toward statewide 
interoperability.  Interoperable communications funding is a priority for the area and the state as a whole; 
budgets are developed and equipment is procured according to strategic goals.  However, funding is currently 
based on federal grants, and there is no long-term regional funding plan for recurring expenses, without 
which there is no guarantee of continued ability to operate and maintain existing interoperability 
infrastructure.  The Vermont Communications Committee (VCOMM) established the Regional Interoperable 
Communications Committee (RICC) in March 2006 to create the Tactical Interoperable Communications 
Plan (TICP).  The RICC includes local, state, and federal representation and has both a technical and an 
operations working group.  The area has published and active agreements (signed memoranda of 
understanding [MOU] for VCOMM) but has not yet put the agreements into practice.  There are formal 
partnerships among the Vermont Sheriff’s Association and the Vermont Police Association, and informal 
partnerships with the remaining public safety agencies in the area.  The area is working toward the 
development of a regional strategic plan but it has not yet been adopted by all agencies, and it is unclear 
whether the plan is aligned with statewide strategic planning efforts.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure that all applicable local, state, and federal agencies (and international border interoperable 
communications efforts as applicable) are involved in the decision-making group and define roles and 
responsibilities as part of the group 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., MOUs) among all participating agencies to achieve regional 
communications interoperability 
• 
Continue to work toward approval, adoption, and acceptance of the regional strategic plan 
• 
Clarify the relationship between the regional and statewide strategic planning efforts 
• 
Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan, with consideration for 
funding models (in addition to grants) that can leverage local, regional, and statewide strategic planning 
efforts

NIMS/ICS implementation is indicative of lower responder familiarity of command and control SOPs.  The 
exercise demonstrated the participants had initial confusion in how to strictly follow the SOPs for command 
and control responsibilities, including the Communications Unit Leader; however, once established they 
were able to perform the required duties.  During the exercise, the participants demonstrated a need for 
further training on the regional SOPs for gateways. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure all regional interoperability SOPs are incorporated into the TICP and distributed to participating 
agencies 
• 
Regularly practice SOPs to increase proficiency in their use (e.g., gateway SOPs)

Northeast Quadrant officials indicated that there is little need for interoperable communications in the area.  
The area does not regularly use its interoperable communications equipment as a result.  During the TICP 
validation exercise, the participants were successful in using shared channels and gateways for 
interoperability, and amateur radios were used for backup communications.  The exercise involved public 
safety agencies across all levels of government (e.g., Vermont State Police, Customs and Border Protection), 
which is commendable.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of all applicable regional interoperability resources, including 
gateways and shared channels, to improve proficiency 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Technology Overview    
Vermont's Northeast Quadrant has limited interoperability options because there are no shared systems or available 
cache radios.  Limited interoperability could be established through shared channels, although not all agencies serving 
the metropolitan area have access to these shared channels.  Alternatively, interoperability could be enabled using 
console patches at dispatch centers or by use of either the City of Newport or the state mobile gateways. 
Long-term goals are to expand the number of radio channels available, specifically the nationally available very high 
frequency (VHF) VCALL/VHF VTAC and ultra high frequency (UHF) UCALL/UHF UTAC channels.  The current 
network includes multiple agencies on state, county, and local levels that use the NIMS/ICS.  These agencies include 
the Vermont Department of Health and Vermont Emergency Management.  Most of the existing dispatches in Vermont 
are done through public safety answering points (PSAP).  The state police have four PSAPs.  The PSAPs perform 
various services for law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services.  This shared system is used on a daily basis.  
The existing network will be expanded to assist selected communities with core coverage needs.  Lastly, services will 
be expanded to include data communications for the first responder community, when funding is available, and to assist 
first responder entities in enhancing their internal communications.

The State of West Virginia has taken the lead in developing the West Virginia Incident Response Plan 
(WVIRP), and a multidiscipline governing board has been designated to oversee this statewide effort.  Under 
the leadership of Harrison County Emergency Services, the Tri-County Region was part of the first 
implementation phase of the WVIRP radio system.  The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) 
was developed for this area as part of this effort.  Informal agreements are in place throughout the area to 
ensure interoperability.  While the state may be involved in strategic planning (including multistate strategic 
planning), it is unclear whether the Tri-County area has developed a strategic plan for their area.  It is also 
unclear whether the strategic plan addresses regional agencies not currently supported by the tri-county 
system, such as the fire community in Monongalia County.  Funding is currently based on federal grants and 
there is no long-term regional funding plan based on sustainable funding sources for recurring expenses, 
without which there is no guarantee of continued ability to operate and maintain existing interoperability 
infrastructure.  . 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to participate in statewide planning committee efforts, and support multi-state interoperability 
efforts 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating 
agencies to achieve regional interoperability 
• 
Develop and implement a strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP), with participant 
approval, adoption, and acceptance 
• 
Ensure that all public safety entities are included in a strategic plan (e.g., clarify whether Monongalia fire 
service is involved)  
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into strategic plan, such as considering funding
