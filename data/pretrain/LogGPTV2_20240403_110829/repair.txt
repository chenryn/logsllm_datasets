**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022

- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `repair` command is used to fix a RAID-5 volume by replacing the failed disk region with a specified dynamic disk. This operation requires that a volume in a RAID-5 array be selected. Use the `select volume` command to choose the appropriate volume and set the focus to it.

**Syntax:**
```shell
repair disk=<disk_number> [align=<alignment>] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **disk=**  
  Specifies the dynamic disk that will replace the failed disk region. The chosen disk must have free space greater than or equal to the total size of the failed disk region in the RAID-5 volume.

- **align=** (Optional)  
  Aligns all volume or partition extents to the closest alignment boundary. `<alignment>` is the number of kilobytes (KB) from the beginning of the disk to the closest alignment boundary.

- **noerr** (Optional)  
  For scripting purposes only. If an error occurs, DiskPart will continue processing commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**

To replace the failed disk region in the volume with focus using dynamic disk 4, type:
```shell
repair disk=4
```

This command will attempt to repair the RAID-5 volume by replacing the failed disk region with the specified dynamic disk.
