Cybersecurity exercises (CDXs) continue to evolve at an astonishing rate. Some are conducted solely in a laboratory setting, while others take place on real-world networks. In the latter case, cyber defenders may be forewarned about the CDX, or the simulated attack (RT) may come as a complete surprise.

In 1997, a team of thirty-five U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) personnel, acting as North Korean hackers, targeted the U.S. Pacific Command in a CDX codenamed "Eligible Receiver." The exercise was a resounding success, as James Adams noted in Foreign Affairs: the RT managed to instill a "paralyzing level of mistrust" in the "human command-and-control system," leading to a situation where "nobody in the chain of command, from the president on down, could believe anything." Additionally, Eligible Receiver highlighted the vulnerability of various national critical infrastructures to common hacker tools and techniques.

Many CDXs involve proof-of-concept demonstrations. For instance, in 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested that the Sandia Red Team (RT) conduct a vulnerability assessment of every water distribution plant serving at least 100,000 people. The concern was that a malicious hacker might alter the chemical composition of the water, making it toxic. Given the large number of such facilities (350), Sandia decided to conduct a detailed analysis of five sites and then develop the Risk Assessment Methodology for Water (RAM-W) for self-assessment.

Today, a significant trend in CDXs is the inclusion of international partners. Since the Internet's architecture is global, cybersecurity is inherently an international responsibility. In 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated a bi-annual, international CDX called Cyber Storm. This event evaluates the collaboration between government agencies and the private sector in thwarting cyber attacks. The 2006 scenario simulated an attack by politically motivated "hacktivists," while the 2008 Cyber Storm II involved a nation-state actor targeting communications, chemical, railroad, and pipeline infrastructure. The 2010 Cyber Storm III added the compromise of trusted Internet transactions and relationships, including cyber attacks resulting in loss of life.

The testing of cyber defenses is not limited to developed countries. In 2009, the U.S. sponsored an international CDX in Tajikistan, involving participants from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Afghanistan.

Baltic Cyber Shield (BCS), held on May 10-11, 2010, in northern Europe, was a "live-fire" CDX. A twenty-person international RT and six national Blue Teams (BTs) participated in an unscripted battle, with the use of malicious code within a virtual battlefield being both authorized and encouraged.

BCS 2010 had three primary goals: to provide BTs with hands-on experience in defending Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, to highlight the international nature of cyberspace and its political, institutional, and legal challenges, and to improve understanding of how to conduct future CDXs.

The White Team (WT) was based primarily in Stockholm, Sweden, with a smaller contingent in Tallinn, Estonia. The WT's scoring criteria measured the BTs' ability to maintain the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of their virtual networks. Points were deducted based on the criticality of compromised systems, and BTs earned points for thwarting attacks and implementing innovative defense strategies.

Each BT consisted of 6-10 personnel from various northern European governments, military, private sector, and academic institutions. They were provided with an identical, pre-built, and somewhat insecure computer network. The BCS 2010 scenario included SCADA software to simulate a power generation company's operations. The BTs were given access to the CDX environment only on the first day and were allowed to harden their networks while maintaining certain applications and services.

The RT, consisting of twenty volunteers from northern Europe, was given two weeks of access to the game environment for reconnaissance. The WT directed the RT to start with minor attacks and progressively increase their scale and sophistication. The RT was divided into four sub-teams based on attack specialization: client-side, fuzzing, web app, and remote.

The Game Team (GT), based in Link√∂ping, Sweden, hosted most of the BCS 2010 infrastructure. The WT had access to a robust visualization environment displaying network topography, traffic flows, observer reports, chat channels, team workspaces, scoreboards, and a map of the CDX environment.

BCS 2010 began when the BTs and RT logged into the CDX environment. The RT campaign was divided into four phases: declaration of war, breaching the castle wall, owning the infrastructure, and wanton destruction. The RT successfully defaced five of the six BT public websites and created a steady stream of incident reports, compromising 42 computers by the end of the first day.

During phase three, the RT aimed to steal the BT networks' "crown jewels," the SCADA infrastructure. Although the RT was successful overall, it achieved limited victories in this phase. The final phase, "wanton destruction," allowed the RT to attack and destroy any BT system, simulating a desperate attempt by K3 to cause maximum disruption.

The RT used a variety of tactics, including exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities, hacking web applications, and employing SQL injection, local and remote file inclusion, path traversal, and cross-site scripting. Other tactics included account cracking, online brute-forcing, DoS with fuzzing tools, and using zero-day exploits.

Although the BCS 2010 scoring system applied only to the BTs, the RT leader felt satisfied with their performance. The most successful BT, which won the exercise, quickly moved essential network services to a custom-built, higher-security virtual machine and implemented IPsec filtering rules. They also used an out-of-band communication channel and disabled preexisting malware.

BCS 2010 highlighted the value of OS-hardening tools and techniques, such as AppArmor, Samhain, and Active Directory group policies. The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD CoE), the Swedish National Defence College (SNDC), and the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) concluded that BCS 2010 achieved its primary goals, providing a robust environment for a live-fire CDX and offering valuable insights into defending CII and SCADA systems.
