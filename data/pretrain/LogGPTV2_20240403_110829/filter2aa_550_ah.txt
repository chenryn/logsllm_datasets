tinues to evolve at an astonishing rate. Some CDXs are conducted only in a labora-
tory, while others take place on real networks in the real world. For the latter, cyber 
defenders may be warned about the CDX before it starts, or the RT attack may come 
as a complete surprise.
In 1997, an RT of thirty-five U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) personnel, playing 
the role of North Korean hackers, targeted the U.S. Pacific Command from cyber-
space. The CDX, code-named Eligible Receiver, was an enormous success. James 
Adams wrote in Foreign Affairs that the RT was able to infect the “human com-
mand-and-control system” with a “paralyzing level of mistrust,” and that “nobody 
in the chain of command, from the president on down, could believe anything.”188 
Furthermore, Eligible Receiver was credited with revealing that a wide variety of 
national critical infrastructures was equally vulnerable to common hacker tools and 
techniques.189
Many CDXs involve a proof-of-concept. In 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency asked the Sandia RT to conduct a vulnerability assessment of every water

184 Lawlor, 2004: Social engineering takes advantage of human weaknesses in security. Experience 
shows that malicious or co-opted insiders, due to the physical access they have to IT systems, can do 
more damage to an organization than a malicious outsider. This type of attack can be surprisingly 
easy to conduct against a large organization, where one does not personally know everyone in the 
organization.
185 For example, the production of energy – as well as the ability to attack an energy plant – can require 
a knowledge of systems and computer languages that is truly unique to that environment.

distribution plant serving at least 100,000 people. The fear was that a malicious 
hacker might be able to change the chemical composition of water enough to poison 
it. When the RT discovered that there were 350 such facilities in the country – far 
too many to examine each one – Sandia decided to conduct a thorough analysis of 
five sites and then construct the Risk Assessment Methodology for Water (RAM-W), 
which could then be used for self-assessment.190
Today, an important trend in CDXs is to encompass international partners. Because 
the architecture of the Internet is international in scope, Internet security is by defi-
nition an international responsibility.
In 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began a bi-annual, inter-
national CDX called Cyber Storm. This event specifically seeks to assess how well 
government agencies and the private sector can work together to thwart a cyber 
attack.191 The 2006 scenario simulated an attack by non-state, politically-motivated 
“hacktivists.”192 The 2008 Cyber Storm II193 simulated a nation-state actor that con-
ducted both cyber and physical attacks on communications, chemical, railroad, and 
pipeline infrastructure.194 In 2010, Cyber Storm III added the compromise of trusted 
Internet transactions and relationships and included cyber attacks that led to the 
loss of life.
The testing of cyber defenses is not confined to the First World. In 2009, the U.S. 
sponsored an international CDX in remote and mountainous Tajikistan, which in-
cluded participants from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan.195
Baltic Cyber Shield (BCS), held on May 10-11, 2010 in numerous countries across 
northern Europe, was a “live-fire” CDX. A twenty-person international RT and six 
national BTs took part in an unscripted battle in which the use of malicious code – 
within the confines of a virtual battlefield196 – was both authorized and encouraged.
190 Preimesberger, 2006.
191 Verton, 2003: Market forces, deregulation, and outsourcing mean that myriad important computer 
networks and critical infrastructures now lie in private hands. This, combined with the reluctance of 
many businesses to disclose cyber attacks for fear of embarrassment, make it difficult for government 
to help protect the private sector.
192 Chan, 2006.
193 This CDX included eighteen federal agencies, nine U.S. states, three dozen private companies, and 
four foreign governments: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK. These were the same 
countries that took part in 2006. It is worth noting that these governments are members of a joint 
1947 intelligence-sharing accord that makes it possible for them to share classified information.
194 Waterman, 2008: The RT also targeted the media in an effort to undermine public trust in government.

196 The entire CDX took place within the bounds of a safe laboratory environment.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
BCS 2010 was similar in nature to the annual CDXs that pit U.S. military services 
against one another197 and for which the Pentagon now sponsors a national com-
petition at the high school level.198 Other CDXs that inspired aspects of BCS 2010 
included the Pentagon’s International Cyber Defense Workshop (ICDW), the UCSB 
International Capture the Flag (iCTF), and the U.S. National Collegiate Cyber Defense 
Competition.
The game scenario described a volatile geopolitical environment in which a hired-
gun, Rapid Response Team of network security personnel defended the computer 
networks of a power supply company against increasingly sophisticated cyber at-
tacks sponsored by a non-state, terrorist group.199
BCS 2010 had three primary goals. First, the BTs should receive hands-on experi-
ence in defending computer networks containing Critical Information Infrastructure 
(CII) and elements of Supervisory Command and Data Acquisition (SCADA).200 Sec-
ond, the CDX scenario sought to highlight the international nature of cyberspace, 
to include the political, institutional, and legal obstacles to improved cyber defense 
cooperation. Third, participating teams were meant to gain a better understanding 
of how to conduct CDXs in the future.
The WT was based primarily at SNDC in Stockholm, Sweden, with a smaller con-
tingent at CCD CoE in Tallinn, Estonia. The WT’s scoring criteria were designed to 
gauge the BTs’ ability to maintain the CIA of their virtual networks, including office 
infrastructure and external services.201 In the event of compromise, the number of 
points lost depended on the criticality of the system, service, or penetration. For 
example, if the RT gained Admin/Root-level access to a computer or compromised 
a SCADA Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), the BT was significantly penalized. 
On the other hand, BTs won positive points for thwarted attacks, for successfully 
197 Caterinicchia, 2003.
198 Defense & Aerospace, 2010: In March 2010, “Team Doolittle” from Clearfield High School in Utah 
won the CyberPatriot II Championships, sponsored by the U.S. Air Force Air Warfare Symposium in 
Orlando, Florida.
199 Lewis, 2010: James Lewis of CSIS recently stated: “It remains intriguing and suggestive that 
[terrorists] have not launched a cyber attack. This may reflect a lack of capability, a decision that 
cyber weapons do not produce the violent results terrorists crave, or a preoccupation with other 
activities. Eventually terrorists will use cyber attacks, as they become easier to launch...”
200 SCADA systems can be used to support the management of national critical infrastructures such as 
the provision of electricity, water, natural gas and manufacturing. The disruption or other misuse of 
such systems could potentially become a national security issue.
201 Both automated and manual means were used to verify CIA. The latter, for example, could entail the 
WT simulating the actions of ordinary users. They may periodically request a BT webpage to see that 
it is reachable and not defaced.

completing in-game “business requests,”202 and for the implementation of innovative 
cyber defense strategies and tactics.
The six BTs consisted of 6-10 personnel each, and hailed from various northern 
European governments, military, private sector, and academic institutions. All were 
provided an identical, pre-built, and somewhat insecure computer network com-
posed of 20 physical PC servers running a total of 28 virtual machines.203 These 
were further divided into four VLAN segments – DMZ, INTERNAL, HMI,204 and PLC. 
The BT networks were further connected to various in-game servers that provided 
additional business functionality to their fictitious users.
The BCS 2010 scenario called for the inclusion of SCADA software in order to simu-
late a power generation company’s production, management, and distribution capa-
bilities. These comprised GE PLCs, Simplicity HMI terminals, Historian databases, 
and two physically-separated model factories per BT network.
Because of the “rapid response” nature of the BCS 2010 scenario, the BTs were given 
access to the CDX environment – including somewhat outdated network documenta-
tion – only on day one of the CDX. They were allowed to harden their networks,205 but 
a minimum number and type of applications and services had to be maintained.206 
The BTs were allowed to install new software and/or modify existing software. How-
ever, offensive BT cyber attacks, either against the RT or against other BTs, were 
strictly prohibited.207
202 This aspect of the game was intended to raise the stress level of BT participants. It simulated the real-
world challenge of handling both security threats and ordinary business processes at the same time. 
For example, a CEO may call while on a business trip, needing immediate remote access, and the BT 
must provide a timely solution. Alternatively, a BT member might become “ill” and have to spend one 
hour on “sick leave” in a break room.
203 The BTs accessed the game environment by VMWare Console from a browser or over SMB, RPC, SSH, 
VNC, or RDP. The power company’s network included both Windows and Linux operating systems. 
Unfortunately, the Console access of the free version of VMWare Server proved to be too slow and 
unstable for such a large event.
204 Human Machine Interface: these workstations ran the control software for the PLCs, providing the 
communication link between the Supervisor node and the remote factories.
205 In the real world too, new IT hires cannot assume that legacy systems are secure or even properly 
installed. They are likely to find some vulnerable, unpatched, redundant, etc systems. Further, 
existing documentation may be dated or incomplete. Once given access to the infrastructure, the 
BTs were allowed to disable, patch, and/or replace applications and services as long as the final 
configuration met CDX parameters.
206 These included HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, DNS, FTP, IMAP/POP3, SSH, and NTP.
207 As a starting point, the BTs must stay within their countries’ legal frameworks.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
The BCS RT consisted of twenty volunteers208 from throughout northern Europe.209 
The RT was given access to the game environment two weeks prior to the CDX in 
order to simulate a degree of prior reconnaissance. To maximize the CDX’s value 
to all participants, the WT directed the RT to begin its attacks slowly, and to pro-
gressively increase the scale and sophistication of its attacks throughout the game. 
Beyond that, there was no limit on the type of hacker tools and techniques that the 
RT could use.210 However, the RT was strictly prohibited from attacking the CDX 
infrastructure,211 and all attacks were confined to the virtual game environment. In-
ternally, the RT divided itself into four sub-teams, depending on the hackers’ attack 
specialization: “client-side,” “fuzzing,” “web app,” and “remote.”
The GT, based at the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) in Linköping, Sweden, 
hosted most of the BCS 2010 infrastructure. The BT networks were designed col-
laboratively by the GT and the WT. The FOI laboratory consisted of nine racks, with 
twenty physical servers in each rack.212 The game infrastructure included twelve, 
twenty centimeter tall physical models of factories, each with its own PLC, SCADA 
software, and “Ice Fountain” fireworks that the RT could turn on as “proof” of a suc-
cessful attack. The GT provided the RT and BTs access to the game environment via 
OpenVPN.
Finally, the WT had access to a robust visualization environment213 that displayed 
all network topography, network traffic flows, observer reports, chat channels, team 
workspaces, scoreboard, and a terrestrial map of the CDX environment.214
BCS 2010 formally began when the BTs and the RT logged into the CDX environ-
ment. But the most anticipated moment arrived when the RT began its cyber attack 
on the BT networks.
208 The BCS 2010 RT was mostly volunteer-based. However, it is worth noting that one contractor bid to 
provide an RT came in at $500,000.
209 The Estonian Cyber Defence League built and managed the RT.
210 However, it is helpful if many easily-accessible, Internet-available attack tools are used, because the 
BTs will see these often in the real world.
211 Including the game scoring system J.
212 The servers had 2 Xeon 2.2 GHz processors, 2 GB RAM, 80 GB HDD, VMware Server 2.0.2 on Gentoo 
Linux, 2x Ethernet interfaces, and 2 switches, one for management and one for the game network.
213 This was provided by the Finnish company Clarified Networks.
214 In the BCS 2010 scenario, two BTs were theoretically based in South America, two in Africa, and two 
in Asia; the RT was in Iceland (in reality, all teams were located in northern European countries).

Cyber Security: A Technical Primer
The RT campaign was divided into four phases:
• Declaration of war
• Breaching the castle wall
• Owning the infrastructure
• Wanton destruction
The first objective, declaration of war, required the RT to “deface” the six BT public 
websites and to give each power company an ultimatum. In a posted statement, 
the “cyber warfare division” of an extremist environmental organization called “K3” 
demanded that the power company publicly announce its intention to convert to 
alternative, greener power ... or face a crippling cyber attack. The RT succeeded in 
defacing five of the six sites within 30 minutes.
During phase one, the RT was allowed to compromise only one server in each BT 
DMZ and only one internal workstation in each BT network. Even with these con-
straints, however, the RT succeeded in creating such a steady stream of incident 
reports that the WT had trouble translating all of them into negative points for 
the BTs. For example, within an hour the RT had established a live audio and video 
connection into one BT network; in other words, the game had barely begun and a 
digital spy was already working inside one of the power companies.
In the past, a major challenge inherent in CDXs is that it has been difficult for the RT 
to maintain balanced and sustained pressure on all BTs throughout the game. At dif-
ferent stages in a CDX, some BTs could be quite busy, while others had nothing to do. 
To help avoid this, the WT instructed the RT that, for each vulnerability discovered 
on a BT network, the RT must systematically check all other BT systems for the same 
vulnerability and exploit it if possible.
Phase two of the K3 attack campaign called for the RT to compromise as many 
DMZ215 systems as possible. At the end of day one, the RT had successfully attacked 
42 computers, including web and email servers. The RT leader was more than 
pleased with his team’s progress.
Phase three called for the RT to steal the BT networks’ “crown jewels.” In BCS 2010, 
these were the internal network computers that served as the HMI for power gen-
eration and management, i.e., its SCADA infrastructure. Although the RT was quite 
successful in the CDX overall, it claimed only limited victories in phase three. Of the 
215 The DMZ, or demilitarized zone, is a physical or logical subnetwork that is exposed to untrusted 
networks, such as the Internet.

BIRTH OF A CONCEPT: STRATEGIC CYBER SECURITY
twelve model factories, the RT succeeded in setting only one of them on fire, and it 
is still unclear whether this RT success was intentional or accidental.216
The fourth and final phase of BCS 2010, “wanton destruction,” allowed the RT to 
attack and destroy any BT system in the CDX. The goal was to simulate a desperate 
attempt by K3 to cause maximum disruption to the power companies’ operations. 
Unfortunately, RT successes in this phase often denied service to the same comput-
ers it had previously compromised, and it prevented the WT from scoring the game 
properly. In other words, a poorly-designed DoS attack can bring down large sec-
tions of network infrastructure and nearly ruin the game. In this CDX, for example, 
the RT used a custom-configured Cisco router to simulate traffic; at one point, it 
created such a high volume of data that the RT denied itself access to the gamenet 
for 15 minutes.
The RT successfully attacked several publicly-known vulnerabilities during BCS 
2010, including MS03-026, MS08-067, MS10-025, and flaws in VNC, Icecast, Cla-
mAV, and SQUID3. It hacked web applications such as Joomla and Wordpress and 
also employed SQL injection, local and remote file inclusion, path traversal, and 
cross-site scripting against Linux, Apache, Mysql, and PHP. Other tactics included 
account cracking, online brute-forcing, DoS with fuzzing tools, obtaining password 
hashdumps of compromised systems, and using the “pass-the-hash” technique to 
hack into more machines. The RT installed Poison Ivy, netcat, and custom made 
code as backdoors. Metasploit was used to deploy reverse backdoors. The RT modi-
fied compromised systems in various ways, such as altering the victim’s crontab file 
to continuously drop firewall rules. Last but not least, the RT possessed a zero-day 
client-side exploit for virtually every browser in existence today.
Although the BCS 2010 scoring system applied only to the BTs, when the game was 
over, the RT leader smiled as if his team had won the game. When the CDX ended, 
there were over 80 BT computers that were confirmed compromised.
However, the BTs did adopt some successful defensive strategies. The most success-
ful BT – which was also declared the winner of BCS 2010 – quickly moved essential 
network services, such as NTP, DNS, SMTP and WebMail, to its own custom-built, 
higher-security virtual machine. IPsec filtering rules were used for communications 
with the Domain Controller. This BT had also requested the use of an “out-of-band” 
communication channel for its discussions with the WT, i.e., not the in-game email 
system, which it assumed might be compromised. Finally, the winning BT was suc-
cessful in finding and disabling preexisting GT-installed malware.217
216 The RT may have gotten lucky while examining the SCADA Modbus protocol with their fuzzing tools.
217 Preexisting malware can simulate what a Rapid Response Team would likely find on any computer 
network.
61
Cyber Security: A Technical Primer
BCS 2010 also highlighted the value of numerous current OS-hardening tools and 
techniques. For Linux computers, these included AppArmor, Samhain, and custom 
short shell scripts; for Windows, Active Directory (AD) group policies, the CIS SE46 
Computer Integrity System, Kernel Guard, and the central collection of event logs. 
For all OSs, the white/black-listing and blocking/black hole-routing of offending IP 
addresses, on a case-by-case basis, proved invaluable.
The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD CoE), the Swedish Nation-
al Defence College (SNDC) and the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) believe 
that BCS 2010 accomplished its three primary goals.
First, the GT network infrastructure provided a sufficiently robust environment for 
a rare “live fire” CDX that offered six professional BTs the opportunity to defend CII 
and SCADA-enabled computer networks against a highly-motivated, capable RT. All 
teams were fully occupied throughout the two-day exercise, and very little down-
time was reported. Further, the BCS 2010 scenario described a “cyber terrorist”
