  * Electron version: 0.37.2 + 0.36.12
  * Operating system: OS X 10.11.4 (15E65)
The process doesn't seem to exit like `node` does. I've reduced it to
something `babel-register` is doing. I'm not sure if this is a bug within
babel or electron, so feel free to close this if it's a bug with babel. It's
the same behavior on both 0.37.2 and 0.36.12.
    # works properly, does nothing and exits
    node -e "require('babel-register')"
    # hangs forever until you ctrl+c
    ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=true node_modules/.bin/electron -e "require('babel-register')"
A complete test:
    mkdir electron-node-hang
    cd electron-node-hang
    npm init -y
    npm install electron-prebuilt babel-register --save
    ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=true node_modules/.bin/electron -e "require('babel-register')"
