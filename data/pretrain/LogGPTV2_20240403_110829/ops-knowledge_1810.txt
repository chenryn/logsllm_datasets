User: How to implement DDoS attack protection for Internet websites? Please describe three commonly used methods and compare their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: The three commonly used DDoS attack protection methods for Internet websites are: 1. Traditional traffic cleaning Traditional traffic cleaning is the most common DDoS attack protection method. It uses technical means to identify and clear common DDoS attack traffic, filter and distribute legitimate traffic . The specific operation method is to classify and filter the traffic entering the server through network devices such as network switches and routers, and then clean up and integrate the traffic on this basis to ensure that the business will not be affected. The advantage is that it can quickly respond to attacks and has high security. The disadvantage is that there is no symptomatic treatment and it cannot be solved for advanced attacks. 2. CDN Acceleration CDN acceleration is an acceleration method for distributing server content to nodes around the world. By distributing requests between nodes and reducing server requests from the main site, it can effectively reduce the pressure of DDoS attacks. The advantages are good user experience, fast speed, and the ability to resist common DDoS attacks. The disadvantage is that it costs more. 3. Cloud security services such as elastic computing Elastic computing and other cloud security services are relatively new technologies, which mainly ensure the safety and reliability of cloud storage through high-performance computing resource management, data compression, security protocols, etc., and have great scalability , suitable for high-level malicious attacks. The advantage lies in low cost, strong scalability, and high security. The disadvantage is that it requires the basic capabilities of cloud technology and requires a high investment of human resources. Generally speaking, the above three commonly used Internet website DDoS attack protection methods have advantages and disadvantages, and can be flexibly used according to the actual situation. It is recommended not only to use the first two traditional defense methods, but also consider investing a certain amount of money in cloud security services to ensure network security.
