How to sort processes according to CPU, memory and other indicators: In daily operations, we may need to sort processes according to different indicators, you can use the following commands: - ps command: you can use different options to sort processes, such as ps aux --sort=-%cpu means to sort by CPU usage from high to low. - top command: You can use various options to sort according to different indicators in the real-time monitoring interface. For example, press Shift+M in the top interface to sort by memory usage. For example, use the ps command to sort by CPU usage from high to low: ``` $ ps aux --sort=-%cpu ``` Among them, the --sort option specifies the sorting method, and - means reverse sorting. %cpu indicates CPU usage.
