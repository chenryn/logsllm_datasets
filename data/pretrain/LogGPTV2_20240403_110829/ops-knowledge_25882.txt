User: I have a program I've written in Python 2.7 on Windows, and I've been using py2exe with total success to make it into an exe (and associated files). However, a reasonable number of people who I want to use it are on Linux/OSX, and while some have been able to make the Windows version work with Wine, others have not been so successful. I've looked thoroughly into py2installer, py2app, freeze and others, but if I understand correctly (I am new to Python and very new to compiling) you need to run them on the system you want to compile them for, i.e. you can only compile for Linux on Linux and OSX on OSX. I don't want to distribute just the raw files because I want the source code to be obfuscated as it is inside a .exe, amd obviously not everyone has Python.
So, my question is: is there any way to compile for OSX or Linux, in Python, while on a Windows machine? And if not, what do you think the best alternative solution might be?
Assistant: Get Virtualbox, install Ubuntu in it, and build it "natively" in for Linux.  These things work really well, and cross compilation is just asking for trouble.  You're going to eventually need Linux to answer the support questions you'll get from these customers anyway! :(
