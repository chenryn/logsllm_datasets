I built the libcaffe2.a for android as the guide[./scripts/build_android.sh].
The build is success, but I find that the library is too large[800MB+]. The
library file in Android Demo(such as AICamera-Style-Transfer & AICamera) is
small[Only 60MB]. Is there a way to reduce the file size? How to config?
