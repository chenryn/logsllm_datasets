### Title: BotConf2017 - Necurs: Malware, Penny Stocks, and Pharma Spam

Email threats have long been a significant component of the cybersecurity landscape. With the decline in the use of exploit kits and other malware distribution methods, malicious spam campaigns have become even more crucial in spreading malware to organizations worldwide. Enter Necurs, the most prominent player in the spam arena today.

Over the past few years, Necurs has dramatically transformed the email threat landscape and continues to innovate in the distribution of malware downloaders. Widely regarded as the largest spam botnet globally, Necurs is responsible for a substantial portion of the daily spam volume. Despite its significant threat, there is limited publicly available information about its structure and operational methods.

This presentation will provide an in-depth analysis of the Necurs botnet, including its command and control (C2) mechanisms. We will examine some of the major spam campaigns it has orchestrated, which include both malware distribution and non-malware-based activities such as stock pump-and-dump schemes. Additionally, we will discuss the C2 infrastructure and domain generation algorithm (DGA) capabilities observed over the past several months.

We will also explore the modular nature of the Necurs malware, highlighting how this multifaceted threat can generate revenue and cause damage to organizations without even sending a single email.
