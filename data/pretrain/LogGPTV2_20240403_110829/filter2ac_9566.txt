Email threats have always been a major part of the threat landscape. As the use of exploit kits and other malware distribution techniques have decreased, malicious spam campaigns play an even greater role in the distribution of malware to organizations around the globe. Enter Necurs, the biggest player in the spam game today. Over the past couple of years, Necurs has singlehandedly transformed the email threat landscape and continues to innovate with regards to the distribution of malware downloaders. Widely considered to be the largest spam botnet on the planet, Necurs is responsible for a large percentage of the overall spam volumes seen around the globe every day. For being such a major threat, very little information has been published regarding its makeup and how it’s being operated by cybercriminals. This talk will take a deep dive on the botnet itself and the ways in which C2 is handled. This includes analysis of some of the major spam campaigns for which it has been responsible including both malware distribution and other non-malware based campaigns, including stock based pump-and-dump. Additionally, we will discuss details of the C2 infrastructure and DGA capabilities we’ve observed over the last several months. We will also cover the modular nature of the Necurs malware itself, and how this multi-faceted threat is capable of generating revenue and damaging organizations without sending a single email.
