## Introduction: Where Are We?
### Asking the Right Questions
- **Engineering Relevance:** The importance of accurately defining the problem.
- **Key Questions:**
  - What can attack a national infrastructure?
  - What can be done about it?
  - How much time do we have?
  - Who cares and how much do they care?

### The Setting
- **Interdependence in Advanced Societies:** Increased interdependence in advanced societies.
- **Equidistance and Latency:** The Internet's unique characteristics.
- **Skill-to-Power Ratio:** The decline in user skill relative to technological power.
- **Information Mobility:** The increasing mobility of information assets.
- **Risk Ownership:** Ambiguity in digital security risk ownership.

### Drivers of Change
- **Laboratory Innovations:** Ongoing advancements from commercial laboratories.
- **Economics:** Economic factors influencing national infrastructure.
- **Psychology:** Public demand and government response.

### Lab: Model Creep
- **Moore’s Law and Its Twins:**
  - CPU: 10^2 increase over ten years.
  - Data: 10^3 increase over ten years.
  - Bandwidth: 10^4 increase over ten years.
- **Implications for Optimal Computing Plant:**
  - Constant dollar buyers will have more data per computer cycle.
  - Data will be movable faster.

### Econ: Applications
- **Federated Applications:**
  - Accumulating multiple security domains.
  - Increasing complexity.
  - Crossing jurisdictions.
- **Economic Influences:**
  - Web services and application reach.
  - Complexity-hiding and productivity-enhancing applications.

### Econ: Transport
- **HTTP as Transport Mechanism:**
  - Lowering the skill level required for attacks.
  - Collapsing content inspection.
  - Diseconomic perimeter defense.

### Econ: Data
- **Data Dominance:**
  - Corporate IT spending on storage.
  - Data volume doubling every 30 months.
  - Security focus shifting towards data.

### The Public’s Interest
- **Spam, Viruses, and Theft:**
  - Channel saturation and labor costs.
  - Shrinking warning times and labor costs.
  - Identity, cycles, keystrokes, and reputation theft.
- **Safety Concerns:**
  - Public interest in safety.

### One Reaction
- **Privacy Regulations:**
  - Increasing number of privacy regulations in the US and Canada.
  - Graph showing the trend from 1975 to 2002.

### The Public Interest
- **Loss of Unique Assets:**
  - Examples: GPS array, FAA EBS, DNS.
  - Cascade failure and high victim-to-attacker conversion rates.

### Risk to Unique Asset
- **Pre-conditions:**
  - Concentrated data and communications.
- **Ignition:**
  - Targeted high-power attacks.
- **Counter:**
  - Defense in depth and replication.
- **Requirement:**
  - Resolve to spend money.

### Risk of Cascade Failure
- **Pre-conditions:**
  - Always-on monoculture.
- **Ignition:**
  - Exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **Counter:**
  - Risk diversification.
- **Requirement:**
  - Resolve to create heterogeneity.

### Why Exploits Matter
- **Monoculture Force Multiplier:**
  - Amateurs providing smokescreens for professionals.
  - Known vulnerabilities get fixed; unknown ones are held in reserve.
  - Automated reverse engineering of patches.

### Wishful Thinking
- **Absence of Major Attacks:**
  - Possible interpretations: zero threat, risk aggregation, or undetected precursors.

### Microsoft in Particular
- **Tight Integration:**
  - User lock-in and increased module size.
  - Complexity and security flaws.
  - Market share and vulnerable monoculture.

### Software
- **Software Licenses:**
  - Lack of clarity in responsibility when software is misused.

### Field Repairs
- **Patching:**
  - Damage containment.
  - Liability and patch-state.
  - Automatic updates and mobile code.

### Predictions
- **Traffic Analysis and Cryptography:**
  - Commercial sector catching up to military.
- **Perimeter Defense:**
  - Shifting from enterprise-scale to individual data objects.
- **Security and Privacy:**
  - Long-overdue collision.
- **Meritocracy:**
  - Yielding to government control.

### Grand Challenges
- **Within Ten Years:**
  - No large-scale epidemics.
  - COTS tools for building certifiable systems.
  - Low/no skill required for safety.
  - Information risk management surpassing financial risk management.

### Metrics
- **Importance of Measurement:**
  - Quoting Lord Kelvin on the necessity of measurement.
- **Questions for CFOs:**
  - Security status, year-over-year improvement, spending, peer comparison, and risk transfer options.

### Metrics: Adapt Not Create
- **Borrowing from Other Fields:**
  - Public health, accelerated failure time testing, insurance, portfolio management, and physics.

### Metrics: Information Sharing
- **Models for Information Sharing:**
  - Central, mandatory, top-down.
  - Specific, enlightened self-interest.
  - Exception vs. routine data.

### Sharing: Top Down
- **Centers for Disease Control (CDC):**
  - Mandatory reporting of communicable diseases.
  - Longitudinal analysis and outbreak handling.
