Assistant: There are many measures to ensure system security and prevent malicious code attacks. Common security precautions are listed below: 1. Use a security firewall: Firewalls can effectively prevent malicious code attacks, limit network intrusion and protect network security. 2. Install anti-virus software: Anti-virus software can monitor system status, detect viruses and malware, and give an alarm or delete viruses or malware when found. 3. Regularly update the operating system and software: The operating system and software may have vulnerabilities that hackers can use to attack the system. Updating relevant software can patch vulnerabilities and improve system robustness. 4. Account rights management: set different rights for different users, administrators can have higher rights, and general users can only access some resources they need. In this way, the user's access scope can be effectively limited, and the user can be prevented from performing malicious operations on the system. 5. Security training: Enterprise employees should receive relevant training on system security and information security, understand how to use security measures to protect systems and data, and improve employees' security awareness. 6. Data backup: Regular data backup can restore data when necessary, so that data will not be lost due to damage to the computer system or malicious attacks. The above are common system security precautions. Enterprises or individuals can take different measures according to specific needs when conducting system security precautions.
