Install and configure log forwarding tools such as Filebeat or Logstash on each server to forward server logs to a centralized log management system. 3. Set the log index and storage strategy on the centralized log management system to facilitate subsequent search and query. 4. Set reasonable alarm rules, and send alarm notifications in time when abnormal or warning information appears in the system log. 5. Regularly analyze logs, find problems and adjust them in time to improve the availability and stability of the system. In general, this solution can help enterprises monitor the system logs of multiple servers in real time, manage and analyze the logs in a unified way, find problems and provide early warnings. At the same time, log analysis can help enterprises optimize the system and improve system availability and stability.
