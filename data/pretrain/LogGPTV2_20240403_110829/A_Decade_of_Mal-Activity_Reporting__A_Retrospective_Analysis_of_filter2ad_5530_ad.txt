### Lifetimes in Table 4(a)

We observe that the United States (US) has the longest mean lifetime of 511 weeks, significantly outpacing other countries. China ranks second with a mean lifetime of 55.8 weeks, indicating a much higher persistence of reported malicious activity in the US compared to any other country. Brazil, Canada, and the UK follow, with mean lifetimes of 54.8, 37.8, and 37.7 weeks, respectively. At the AS-level, "China Telecom Backbone" (AS4134) is the most persistent, with a mean lifetime of 147.0 weeks.

### Deathtime Analysis

Figure 7b and Table 4(b) suggest that while most IP addresses have a mean deathtime longer than 100 weeks, indicating low participation, a small number of IPs are recurring participants. Focusing on the AS and country level, we observed that most ASes and countries are repeat offenders from the perspective of blacklist reporting. In terms of resiliency (low deathtime), the US ranks first with no deathtime, followed by Germany (1.50 weeks) and the British Virgin Islands (1.60 weeks).

### Rate of Arrival

For the rate of arrival, we calculate the reciprocal of the mean duration and rank the countries accordingly. Table 4(c) shows that the top five countries in terms of arrival rates are Colombia, Panama, the Bahamas, Norway, and Mexico, constituting the most recurrent countries reported for malicious activities.

### Churn Analysis with Respect to Mal-Activity Classes

From Figure 8a, we observe that exploits tend to have the lowest mean lifetime (one week), while other mal-activity classes exhibit similar lifetimes with a heavier concentration at longer durations. In terms of resiliency, phishing has the lowest deathtime (highest resiliency), as shown in Figure 8b. Due to its lower mean deathtime, phishing also has the highest mean rate of arrival, as indicated in Figure 8c, implying highly frequent on-off reporting cycles.

### Lessons Learned

The analysis reveals that a small number of hosts exhibit high renewal of malicious activities, indicating that their presence on blacklists has not deterred their activities. The most recurrent IP has an average report activity cycle of 5.5 weeks. If this host had been blocked by blacklists, it would have been removed from these lists in less than 5.5 weeks from the first reports. Therefore, blacklists should consider longer durations before delisting a malicious host. Phishing has the highest resiliency, with an average of 54 weeks less than all mal-activities combined, suggesting either delisting or the ability to circumvent blacklist-based blocking. An overwhelming majority (97.7%) of IP reports cease activities within two weeks, with average cycles of 185 weeks. Blacklist providers must balance potential false positives of hosts that were only momentarily infected against curbing the minority of recurrent hosts.

### Magnitude of Reported Malicious Activities

We define a "severity" metric to quantify the magnitude of reported activities during active periods of malicious hosts in the blacklists. Formally, severity is defined as the average number of reports of malicious activities per active cycle. For host \( i \), let \( K_{i,c} \) denote the total number of reports within the \( c \)-th period of activity, and \( L_{i,c} \) denote the active period (in weeks). The severity of host \( i \) is then defined as the average of \( K_{i,c} / L_{i,c} \) over all cycles of the host in the dataset. A high severity value indicates that whenever a host is active, it is accompanied by a large volume of reported malicious activities. This metric allows us to distinguish between long-living, persistent reporting and short-living but denser reporting mal-activities.

### Results of Magnitude Analysis

We report the results of the magnitude analysis in Figure 9. We observe that 27.4% of ASes and 9.45% of countries have a severity value. The US has the highest severity of 82,558 reports per week, followed by China, Germany, France, and Ukraine with severity values of 377, 212, 149, and 80, respectively. This is likely due to the fact that the majority of hosting services and Internet users originate from the US. Interestingly, AS7276 (UNIVERSITY-OF-HOUSTON) has the highest severity among ASes, with 2,206 malicious activities per week, participating in all categories of malicious activities except spamming, with 59,785 reports in the dataset.

### Lessons Learned

Our analysis shows that malware is the largest component of reports (90.9%), but when considering the severity of reports, malware produces an average of 30.8 reports per week. Phishing, despite comprising only 4.74% of our dataset, has the next largest severity, with 9.3 reports per week. On average, malware is approximately three times as severe as phishing, despite there being 19 times more malware reports than phishing reports. It would be advisable for enforcement agencies to focus on the primary attack vector, which is malware, as disabling a malware source would yield the largest reduction in reports per week. However, shutting down a phishing host is also important, as it receives a third of the reports of the most severe malicious activity.

### Related Work

Several studies have characterized and measured malicious activities, proposing detection and prevention techniques. Some researchers detect botnet-based malicious activities by investigating traffic or typical behavior, while others use multiple datasets, including web resources from suspicious domains, host and network information, honeypots, or DNS traffic. Kuhrer et al. [47] analyze the performance of blacklists, collecting data over two years. In contrast, our study revisits the blacklists utilized by them and collects a backward-facing dataset covering 10 years. Dhamdhere et al. [38] define metrics to describe the relationship among ASes, but they do not focus on malicious activity reporting. Antonakakis et al. [33] study Mirai Botnet activity, but their dataset is not publicly available and focuses on a specific type of malicious activity. Leita et al. [48] propose HARMUR, a system leveraging historical archives of malicious URLs, but it is forward-facing. Lever et al. [49] investigate the evolution and behavior of malware and PUPs, while our study retrieves static data sources spanning 10 years and covers broader categories of malicious activities.

### Conclusion

Researchers and the industry find themselves in a continual arms race against major instances of malicious activity on the internet. Although longitudinal datasets exist, they are mostly proprietary due to privacy and competitive reasons. In this paper, we address this gap by combining imperfect historical records with machine learning to produce a decade-long malicious activity dataset. To assist the research community, we have released our dataset into the public domain:

With our unique dataset, we reflect on the behavior of malicious activity reporting over the last decade to gain insights into the continuing presence of malicious activity. Our analysis characterizes host behavior, recurrent periods, and the severity of malicious activity reporting in a P2P-inspired churn model. Our findings suggest that tracking heavy malicious activity contributors should be a priority for law enforcement agencies, major network providers, and cloud operators. We found a consistent minority of heavy offenders (IPs, ASes, and countries) contributing a majority of malicious activity reports, posing a severe threat to the status quo of our online ecosystem. We observed several hosts with a short renewal cycle of (in)activity, indicating that their presence on a blacklist has not deterred their activities. Detecting and quickly reacting to the emergence of such heavy malicious activity contributors would significantly reduce the damage inflicted by them.
