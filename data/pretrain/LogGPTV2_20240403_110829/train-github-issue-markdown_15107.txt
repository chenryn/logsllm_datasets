### Problem Description

When adding an `onBlur` event handler to a `TextField`, the label does not revert to its unfocused state when the field loses focus.

**Visual Representation:**
![Issue Demonstration](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/313189/26436140/8c2b4f68-413e-11e7-87be-6e407c2e3d66.gif)

**Code Example:**

```jsx
// This works as expected
<TextField />

// This does not work as expected
<TextField onBlur={() => {}} />
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- The label should revert to its unfocused state when the `TextField` loses focus, regardless of whether an `onBlur` event handler is attached.

**Actual Behavior:**
- When an `onBlur` event handler is added to the `TextField`, the label remains in the focused state even after the field loses focus.
