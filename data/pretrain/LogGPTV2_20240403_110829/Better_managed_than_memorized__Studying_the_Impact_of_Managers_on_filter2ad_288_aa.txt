Abstract
Despite their well-known security problems, passwords
are still the incumbent authentication method for virtually
all online services. To remedy the situation, users are
very often referred to password managers as a solution to
the password reuse and weakness problems. However, to
date the actual impact of password managers on password
strength and reuse has not been studied systematically.
We provide the ﬁrst large-scale study of the pass-
word managers’ inﬂuence on users’ real-life passwords.
By combining qualitative data on users’ password cre-
ation and management strategies, collected from 476
participants of an online survey, with quantitative data
(incl. password metrics and entry methods) collected in
situ with a browser plugin from 170 users, we were able
to gain a more complete picture of the factors that inﬂu-
ence our participants’ password strength and reuse. Our
approach allows us to quantify for the ﬁrst time that pass-
word managers indeed inﬂuence the password security,
however, whether this inﬂuence is beneﬁcial or aggravat-
ing existing problems depends on the users’ strategies
and how well the manager supports the users’ password
management right from the time of password creation.
Given our results, we think research should further inves-
tigate how managers can better support users’ password
strategies in order to improve password security as well
as stop aggravating the existing problems.

Introduction
For several decades passwords prevail as the default au-
thentication scheme for virtually all online services [44,
11, 30]. At the same time, research has again and again
demonstrated that passwords perform extremely poor in
terms of security [48]. For instance, various attacks ex-
ploit that humans fail to create strong passwords them-
selves [10, 19, 45, 31, 34]. Even worse, there is an ob-
servable trend towards an increasing number of online ser-
vices that users register to. This increasing number of re-
quired passwords in combination with the limited human
capacity to remember passwords leads to the bad practice
of re-using passwords across accounts [26, 51, 16, 66].
In the past, different solutions have been implemented
to help users creating stronger passwords, such as pass-
word meters and policies, which are also still subject of
active research [41, 54, 17, 45, 68]. Among the most of-
ten recommended solutions [28, 59, 53, 62, 56] to these
problems for end-users is technical support in the form of
password management software. Those password man-
agers come built-in to our browsers, as a browser plugin,
or as separate applications. Password managers are being
recommended as a solution because they fulﬁll impor-
tant usability and security aspects at the same time: They
store all the users’ passwords so the users do not have to
memorize them; they can also help users entering their
passwords by automatically ﬁlling them into log-in forms;
and they can also offer help in creating unique, random
passwords. By today, there are several examples of third
party password managers that ﬁt this description, such
as Lastpass [5], 1Password [1], and even seemingly unre-
lated security software, such as anti-virus [4] solutions.
Unfortunately, it has not been sufﬁciently studied in
the past whether password managers fulﬁll their promise
and indeed have a positive inﬂuence on password security
or not? To break this question down, we are interested
in 1) whether password managers actually store strong
passwords that are likely auto-generated by, for instance,
password generators, or if they really are just storage
where users save their self-made, likely weak passwords?
Further, we are interested whether 2) users, despite using
password managers, still reuse passwords across different
websites or if do they use the managers’ support to main-
tain a large set of unique passwords for every distinct
service? Prior works [66, 51] that studied password reuse
and strength in situ have also considered password man-
agers as factors, but did not ﬁnd an inﬂuence by managers
and could not conclusively answer those questions.

Our contributions: We argue that to speciﬁcally study
the impact of password managers, important aspects were
missing in prior work, and this paper’s most tangible con-
tribution is an extension of prior methodologies to be able
to study password managers’ impact in the wild. First,
previous works considered only the presence of password
management software on the user device and whether
a password was auto-ﬁlled or not. However, to better
distinguish the storage option of a password (i.e., mem-
orized and manually entered, auto-ﬁlled by the browser,
copy&pasted, or ﬁlled by a browser plugin) a more ﬁne-
grained entry method detection is required. Second, users
do not axiomatically follow strict workﬂows for password
creation, storage, and entry [27, 29, 62, 56, 58] (see Fig-
ure 1). For instance, the effort users are willing to invest in
creating a unique and strong password often depends on
the privacy-sensitivity of the associated account. For creat-
ing a new password, the approaches range from mental al-
gorithms (e.g., leetifying a known word) over pen&paper
algorithms and password generator tools (e.g., websites
like https://www.random.org/passwords/) to 3rd
party password managers (e.g., LastPass, KeePass, etc.).
Based on different factors, such as technical skills, trust in
software vendors, ﬁnancial expenditure, multi-device sup-
port, or others, users resort to different password storage
options from where the password ﬁnds its way via vari-
ous entry methods into the login forms. To better study
password managers’ inﬂuence, one has to take the users’
creation and storage strategies into consideration as well.
In particular, one has to understand if the user pursues
primarily a creation strategy based on password manager
support and whether there then exists an observable effect
of this strategy on the password strength and reuse.
In this paper, we present a study that reﬂects those
considerations (see the bottom of Figure 1). We ﬁrst re-
cruited 476 participants on Amazon MTurk to conduct
a survey sampling to better understand users’ strategies
for creating and storing passwords, their attitudes towards
passwords, and past experiences with password leaks or
password managers. From those insights, we identiﬁed
two distinct groups in our participant pool: users of pass-
word managers and users abstaining from technical help
in password creation. We were further able to recruit 170
of our participants, 49 of which reported using password
managers, for a follow-up study in which our participants
allowed us to monitor their passwords through a Google
Chrome browser plugin that collected password metrics
as well as answers to in situ questionnaires upon password
entry. This gave us detailed information about real-life
passwords, including their strength, their reuse, and, for
the ﬁrst time, their entry method (e.g., manually typed,
auto-ﬁlled, pasted, or entered by a browser plugin) as
well as the passwords’ context, including user reported
value of the password (e.g., loss of social repudiation or
ﬁnancial harm when the password would be leaked).
Based on the combined data from our survey sampling
and plugin-based data collection, we are able to study the
factors that inﬂuence password strength and reuse from a
new perspective. Using exploratory data analysis and sta-
tistical testing, including regression models, we are ﬁrst
to actually show that password managers indeed inﬂuence
password strength and reuse. In particular, the relation be-
tween different entry methods and the password strength
depends on the users’ entire process of password han-
dling. Using a workﬂow that includes technical support
from password creation through storage to entry leads to
stronger passwords, while this positive effect on password
strength cannot be detected when considering the input
method individually. A similar picture emerges for pass-
word reuse. Passwords entered manually or by Chrome
auto-ﬁll were unique in only 20–25% of all cases. For
LastPass or Copy&Paste password entry, the proportion
of non-reused passwords increases to 53–78%. This is
still far from ideal—that not even a single password is
reused—but still a signiﬁcant improvement through such
dedicated password management tools. Similar to the
results for password strength, we ﬁnd that password reuse
improves further if the password generation is technically
supported. In contrast to password strength, however, this
positive effect is similar for all input methods. Looking at
managers that do not offer support for password creation,
such as Chrome’s auto-ﬁll, we even found a negative
inﬂuence in that those managers even contribute to the
password reuse problem. In summary, our results support
the fact that technical tools can have a very positive effect
on password security. However, it is important that the
entire password management process is supported—from
generation, over storage, to entry—and not only the old
and weak passwords of the users are stored.

2.2 Password strength
Textual passwords are for decades [44] the incumbent
authentication scheme for online services [29, 30], and
will very likely remain in that position for the foresee-
able future. They distinguish themselves from alternative
schemes through their very intuitive usage, however, as
well as through a pathological inability of users to create
passwords that withstand guessing attacks [11]. Given the
permanence of passwords, users are commonly referred
to technical help in form of password management soft-
ware [28, 59, 53, 56] to create strong, unique passwords.
In this paper, we aim to better understand how pass-
word managers help users in this task and try to measure
the impact password managers actually have on the cur-
rent status quo. We do this through a comprehensive study
that includes both self-reported user strategies and fac-
tors for password creation and storage as well as in situ
collected password metrics and questionnaire answers.
To put our approach into the larger context and to pro-
vide necessary background information, we give here an
overview of prior research on how users select and (re)use
passwords, how password strength can be measured, and
on dedicated studies of password manager software.
2.1 Password creation
Different works have studied the strategies of users and
the factors that inﬂuence the selection of new passwords.
For instance, users create passwords based on something
that has relevance or meaning to them [56], and very often
passwords are based on a dictionary word [38, 52].
The effort the user is willing to invest into creating a
stronger passwords can depend on different factors. For
example, password policies that enforce a certain pass-
word composition (i.e., length and character classes) can
inﬂuence the user [70, 26, 38]. Similarly, many websites
use password strength meters to provide real-time feed-
back on new password’s strength and nudge users into
creating stronger passwords [23, 61]. However, often
those policies and meters have inconsistent metrics across
different websites [12, 65, 17], potentially confusing users
about what constitutes a strong password [62]. Also the
value of the password protected account can inﬂuence
the user. Prior studies [8, 49, 56, 51] concluded that peo-
ple try to create strong passwords for accounts that they
consider more important, e.g., banking websites. In par-
ticular, users employed password managers for speciﬁc
matters [56], such as just using at a work PC but not at
home, or not using them for banking websites. Despite
their apparent beneﬁts, it is unclear how users actually
use password managers and what the exact impact of
password managers is on password reuse and strength.
Password strength has been studied for several years and
different mechanisms have been used to measure a pass-
word’s strength. Shannon entropy [21] provides a way
to estimate the strength based on the passwords compo-
sition. It was formerly used by the NIST guidelines [28]
to estimate the password strength. However, more recent
research [67, 10, 18, 40] argued that guessability metrics
are a more realistic metric than the commonly used en-
tropy metrics, and recommendations, such as NIST [28],
recently picked up the results of this line of research and
have been updated accordingly. One of the vital insights
from this and other research [34] was that passwords are
not chosen randomly but exhibit common patterns and
are derived from a limited set of dictionary words.
Measuring a password’s guessability has been realized
in different ways. Those include Markov models [13, 19],
pattern matching plus word mangling rules [68], or neu-
ral networks [45]. Since prior password strength meters
were based on the password composition and the result-
ing entropy, those new approaches also found their way
into contending password strength meters [68, 45, 60].
However, varying cracking algorithms or techniques can
cause varying password strength results based on conﬁgu-
ration, methods, or training data [63]. Also in our study
we measure the password strength based on guessability,
using the openly available zxcvbn [68] tool.
2.3 Password reuse
Prior work [56] has shown that users have an increasing
number of online accounts that require creation of a new
password. To cope with the task of remembering a large
number of passwords, users resort to reusing passwords
across different accounts [16, 37], creating a situation in
which one password leak might affect multiple accounts
at once. A large-scale data collection through an instru-
mented browser [26] was ﬁrst to highlight this problem.
Since then, newer studies further illustrated the issue of
password reuse. For instance, in a combination of mea-
surement study of real leaked passwords and user sur-
vey [16], 43% of the participants reused passwords and
often a new password was merely a small modiﬁcation
of an existing one. As with password creation, different
factors can inﬂuence the password reuse. For example,
it was shown that the rate of reused passwords increased
with the number of accounts [27], which is troublesome
considering that users accumulate an increasing number
of accounts. As with password strength, also the value
of the website can affect whether a user creates a unique
new password or reuses an existing one [8, 51].
Closest to our methodology are two recent stud-
ies [66, 51] based on data collected with browser plugins
USENIX Association

from users. Both studies monitored websites for password
entries and recorded the password characteristics, such as
length and composition, a participant-speciﬁc password
hash, the web domain (or domain category), as well as
meta-information including installed browser plugins or
installed software (e.g., anti-virus software). In case of
the newer study [51], also hashes of sub-strings of the
password were collected as well as a strength estimate
using a neural network based password meter [45] and
whether the password was auto-ﬁlled or not. Through this
data, both studies had an unprecedented insight into user’s
real password behavior, the factors inﬂuencing password
reuse, and could show that password reuse, even partial
reuse of passwords, is a rampant problem. Further relating
to our work, both prior studies also considered the poten-
tial inﬂuence of password managers, however, could not
ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effect of password managers on pass-
word reuse or strength. However, their studies were not
speciﬁcally targeted at investigating the impact of pass-
word managers, and with our methodology we extend
those prior works in two important aspects. First, prior
work only considered the presence of password managers
and whether auto-ﬁll was used. For our work, we de-
rived a more ﬁne-grained detection of the password entry
method, which allows us to distinguish human, plugin-
based, auto-ﬁll, or copy&pasted input to password ﬁelds
and thus better detection of managed passwords. Sec-
ond, merely the entry method of a password does not
reveal its origin (e.g., passwords from a password man-
ager might also be copy&pasted or saved in the browser’s
auto-ﬁll). To study the impact of password managers, a
broader view is essential that includes the users’ password
creation strategies in addition to their in situ behavior.
2.4 Security of password managers
Password manager software has also been the subject of
research. Human-subject studies [39, 14] have shown
that they might suffer from usability problems and that
ordinary users might abstain from using them due to trust
issues or not seeing a necessity. Like any other soft-
ware, password managers might also contain vulnerabili-
ties [43, 71] that can compromise user information. Also
the integration of password managers, in particular the
password auto-ﬁlling, was scrutinized [55, 57] and ﬂaws
