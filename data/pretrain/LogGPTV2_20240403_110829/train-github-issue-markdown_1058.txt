Using TensorBoard histogram_freq feature cause a lot of warnings like:
    Instructions for updating:
    Please switch to tf.summary.histogram. Note that tf.summary.histogram uses the node name instead of the tag. This means that TensorFlow will automatically de-duplicate summary names based on their scope.
    WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/Keras-1.1.2-py3.5.egg/keras/callbacks.py:525 in _set_model.: histogram_summary (from tensorflow.python.ops.logging_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30.
Also, turning it off cause another warning:
    WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/keras/callbacks.py:536 in _set_model.: SummaryWriter.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.training.summary_io) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30.
    Instructions for updating:
    Please switch to tf.summary.FileWriter. The interface and behavior is the same; this is just a rename.```
