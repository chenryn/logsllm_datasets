work [30, 32, 45, 49, 52, 56, 74, 82], to the best of our knowledge,
there is no practical study of optical restoration in modern WANs.
Arrow makes two novel contributions. First, Arrow augments
today’s TE formulations to capture partial restoration candidates
for IP links (§3). Second, Arrow uses a noise source to fully popu-
late the amplifiers’ spectrum to bypass their reconfiguration time
(§4), achieving an end-to-end failover latency of eight seconds on a
WAN-scale testbed (§5).
Reconfigurable WANs. Recently, there have been several pro-
posals to enable reconfigurable WANs [18, 27, 33, 34, 37, 49, 71, 77,
87, 89, 91]. Iris proposed an all-optical circuit switched network to
interconnect datacenter sites that are only a few tens of kilome-
ters apart (metro-level) [33]. In contrast, Arrow considers sites
that are thousands of kilometers apart and focuses on fiber cut
restoration. Another class of prior work proposed enabling recon-
figurability in the optical domain to accommodate traffic matrix
changes [18, 27, 34, 49, 71, 87, 91]. Notably, OWAN demonstrated re-
configuring optical wavelengths to adapt topology to achieve better
bulk transfer performance in the WAN [49]. However, OWAN did
not consider failures and its emulated ROADMs did not consider re-
configuration latency. RADWAN [77] proposed changing transpon-
der modulations according to changes to OSNR on fiber paths to
achieve better link utilization and availability. But RADWAN did
not consider fiber cuts. When a fiber cut happens, RADWAN can-
not change the modulation of the wavelengths because the fiber is
down and changing the modulations will not help. OptFlow [37]
proposed a graph model to enable optical reconfigurability with no
change to the TE. But it did not consider partial restoration; hence,
the approach is not portable to Arrow.
8 CONCLUSION
We propose a restoration-aware TE system, called Arrow, to proac-
tively consider partially restorable failures when optimizing traffic
allocations. While the restoration is done on the optical layer and
TE is done on the IP layer, we avoid the computational complexity of
conventional cross-layer formulations by designing a novel abstrac-
tion, called LotteryTicket, to feed only essential information into
the TE formulation to meet the stringent TE runtime requirement.
Our experiments show Arrow supports up to 2.0×–2.4× more de-
mand without compromising availability at 99.99% availability. This
work does not raise any ethical issues.
