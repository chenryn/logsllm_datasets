checking email, software upgrading, administrative tasks using
PowerShell (in Windows), running programs that require ad-
ministrative privileges, and so on. HOLMES subscribed to the
7 Kafka topics (one topic per host) to consume audit streams
and perform analysis and detection in real-time. The number of
records published (in millions) with regards to the percentage
growth of the audit trace duration is shown in Fig. 9 (left).
Note that HOLMES consumes as fast as the publishing rate
from the Kafka server. Fig. 9 (right) shows the incremental
growth in the size of records published into each Kafka topic.
We conÔ¨Ågured HOLMES with TTPs mentioned in Table 8
and set path thres = 3 for prerequisites on TTPs and weight =
(10 + i)/10 for APT stage i, which takes into account slightly
higher weights for later APT stages.

TABLE 11.
Scores Assigned to Attack Scenarios. L = Low, M =
Moderate, H = High, C = Critical. Note: for each scenario, Highest Benign
Score in Dataset is the highest threat score assigned to benign background
activities streamed during the audit log collection of a host (pre-attack, in
parallel to attack, and post-attack).
C. Results in a Nutshell
Table 11 summarizes the detection of the nine attack
scenarios. The second column shows the threat tuple of each
HSG matched during detection, and the third column shows
the corresponding threat score. The fourth column shows the
highest score among all benign scenarios of the machine on
which the attack scenario is exercised. These benign scenarios
might contain the exact programs in the corresponding attack
scenario.
The highest score assigned to benign HSGs is 338
(Scenario-3), and the lowest score assigned to attack HSGs
is 608 (Scenario-5.2) which is related to an incomplete attack
with no harm done to the system. This shows that HOLMES
has separated attack and benign scenarios into two disjoint
clusters, and makes a clear distinction between them.
The effect of learning noise reduction rules and path factor
are shown in Fig. 12. This plot shows threat score for all be-
nign and attack HSGs which are constructed after analyzing all
the seven streams. These scores are shown under three different
settings: default which both learning and path factor calcula-
tions are enabled, without learning, and without path factor.
It is obvious in the Ô¨Ågure that with learning and path factor,
there is a more considerable margin between attack HSGs
and benign ones. Without learning or path factor, we notice
an increase in noise, which leads to false positives or false
negatives. The 10th percentile, Ô¨Årst quartile, and median of
default box are all colliding on the bottom line of this box
(score= 2.1). This means that more than 50% of threat scores
are 2.1, which is the result of having many HSGs with only
one low severity Untrusted Read TTP.

D. Attack Scenarios
We now describe an additional attack scenario detected by
HOLMES. For reasons of space, we include details of the rest
of the scenarios and the related Ô¨Ågures in the appendix. We
note that Scenario-7.2 is discussed in section II and a portion
of its provenance graph and HSG are shown in Fig.s 2 and 5,
respectively.
Scenario-1: Drive-by Download. In this attack scenario (see
Fig. 13), the user visits a malicious website with a vulnerable
Firefox browser. As a result, a Ô¨Åle named net is dropped
and executed on the victim‚Äôs host. This Ô¨Åle, after execution,
connects to a C&C server, and a reverse shell is provided
to the attacker. The attacker then launches a shell prompt
and executes commands such as hostname, whoami, ifconÔ¨Åg,
netstat, and uname. Finally, the malicious executable exÔ¨Åltrates
information to the IP address of the C&C server and then the
attacker removes the dropped malicious Ô¨Åle.
As can be seen from Fig. 13, in the Initial Compromise
APT stage, an untrusted Ô¨Åle is executed, which matches a TTP
