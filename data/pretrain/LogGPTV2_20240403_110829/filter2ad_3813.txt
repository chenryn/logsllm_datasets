FOCUS OF THE WORKSHOP 
Over the last decade, research on dependable computing 
has  undergone  a  shift  from  reactive  towards  proactive 
methods: In classical fault tolerance a system reacts to errors 
or component failures in order to prevent them from turning 
into  system  failures,  and  maintenance  follows  fixed,  time-
based  plans.  However,  due  to  an  ever  increasing  system 
complexity,  use  of  commercial-off-the-shelf  components, 
virtualization,  ongoing  system  patches  and  updates  and 
dynamicity such approaches have become difficult to apply. 
Therefore, a new area in dependability research has emerged 
focusing  on  proactive  approaches  that  start  acting  before  a 
problem  arises  in  order  to  increase  time-to-failure  and/or 
reduce  time-to-repair.  These  techniques  frequently  build  on 
the  anticipation  of  upcoming  problems  based  on  runtime 
monitoring.  Industry  and  academia  use  several  terms  for 
such 
techniques,  each  focusing  on  different  aspects, 
including self-* computing, autonomic computing, proactive 
fault  management, 
software 
rejuvenation, or preventive/proactive maintenance.

system dependability by maintenance. 
It  is  the  goal  of  this  workshop  to  increase  collaboration 
among  researchers  from  various  communities  all  over  the 
world working on the topics of PFARM. We want to provide 
a  stimulating,  and  fruitful  forum  to  foster  collaboration 
among  researchers  working  on  similar  topics,  to  discuss 
ideas, exchange experiences and to  find  new  answers  to  the 
overall challenge of PFARM. In fact, there is some evidence 
that  with  comprehensive  use of proactive  fault  management 
methods

environments (e.g., cloud computing) can be increased by an 
order of magnitude or more.

II.  THIS YEAR’S ACCEPTED PAPERS 
As this year’s edition was only a half-day workshop, we 
selected three papers to be presented at the workshop: 
  Li  Yu,  Ziming  Zheng,  Zhiling  Lan  and  Susan 
Coghlan.  Practical  Online  Failure  Prediction  for 
Blue  Gene/P:  Period-based  vs  Event-driven. 
The paper presents a comparison of event-driven and 
period-based failure prediction approaches, based on

by  showing  how  much  each  talk  was  able  to  persuade 
PFARM  game  participants  to  adjust  their  investments  after 
hearing the talk and award presentation recognizing savviest 
“investors.”

through  Dynamical  Mining  of  Resource  Usage 
Patterns. 
The paper proposes to use sequential pattern mining 
techniques to detect resource leaks in source code. It 
introduces  the  approach  and  applies  a  version 
targeted  to  Java  applications  to  seven  open  source 
projects  that  showed  known  IO-related  resource 
leaks (from bug trackers of these projects).

DynaPlan:  Resource  Placement  for  Application-
Level Clustering. 
This  paper  describes  a  technique  for  near-optimal 
placement  of  applications  in  a  cluster  and  for 
relocating  applications  from  one  or  more  failed 
nodes in a cluster.  The technique considers multiple 
relevant factors in determining where an application 
will  be  placed  (e.g.,  available  memory,  power, 
available CPU bandwidth, security, location). 
III.  THE PFARM GAME 
It  is  the  mission  of  the  PFARM  workshop  to  bring 
together  researchers  from  the  wide  spectrum  of  expertise  in 
various  aspects  of  dependability 
through  community-
building  events  such  as  the  PFARM  challenges  karaoke 
where each participant – speaker or not – was asked to write 
down major challenges in the area of PFARM on a piece of 
paper, which were then folded and collected in a bowl. In the 
karaoke  session,  workshop  participants  were  selected 
randomly  and  had  to  pick  a  challenge  from  the  bowl.  The 
task was to persuasively present why the challenge (posed by 
someone  else)  is  important.  This  little  game  evoked  lively 
discussions  which  offered  new  perspectives  on  a  number  of 
topics.  
The PFARM  karaoke  was  quite  effective  in  collecting  a 
set  of  challenges  but  lacked  any  notion  of  ranking  which 
topic is more important than others. This year, we are going 
to  address  this  by  means  of  an  online  game:  We  set  up  a 
website where any workshop participant can register and get 
100 PFARM nuggets. Each player can subsequently “invest” 
his  or  her  nuggets  in  PFARM  challenges.  When  the  game 
starts  there  will  be  a  list  of  PFARM  challenges  compiled 
from  the  PFARM  karaoke  session  in  2009.  However,  in 
order  to  account  for  the  progress  made  in  the  field,  players 
can  also  add  new  topics  that  are  open  to  investment  for  all 
players. 
The  last  session  of  the  workshop  will  be  devoted  to  an 
evaluation  of  the  PFARM  game.  We  will  present  a  ranking 
of  PFARM  topics  based  on  how  many  nuggets  researchers 
invested  in  each  challenge.  Additionally,  we  will  announce 
the  most  “successful”  researchers  –  the  ones  that  invested 
their  nuggets  in  top-ranked  challenges.  The  top  three 
researchers will then have to explain to the other workshop’s 
attendees, why they invested in certain topics. And finally, to 
provide an entertaining finish, we plan the workshop’s grand
