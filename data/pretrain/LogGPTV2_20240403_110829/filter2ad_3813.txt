## I. Focus of the Workshop

Over the past decade, research in dependable computing has shifted from reactive to proactive methods. Traditional fault tolerance involves reacting to errors or component failures to prevent system failures, with maintenance following fixed, time-based plans. However, the increasing complexity of systems, the use of commercial off-the-shelf components, virtualization, ongoing system patches, updates, and dynamicity have made these approaches challenging to apply.

A new area in dependability research has emerged, focusing on proactive techniques that act before problems arise to increase time-to-failure and reduce time-to-repair. These techniques often rely on runtime monitoring to anticipate upcoming issues. Industry and academia use various terms for such techniques, including self-* computing, autonomic computing, proactive fault management, software rejuvenation, and preventive/proactive maintenance.

Proactive Failure Avoidance, Recovery, and Maintenance (PFARM) techniques typically involve:
- **Runtime Monitoring:** Continuously measuring the system's state.
- **Predictive Algorithms:** Anticipating upcoming problems based on runtime data.
- **Predictive Diagnosis:** Focusing on the root cause of the anticipated problem.
- **Decision and Scheduling Techniques:** Determining which method to apply and when.
- **Efficient and Effective Techniques:** To avoid failures, minimize their negative effects, or improve system dependability through maintenance.

The goal of this workshop is to enhance collaboration among researchers worldwide working on PFARM topics. We aim to provide a stimulating and fruitful forum to foster collaboration, discuss ideas, exchange experiences, and find new solutions to the challenges of PFARM. There is evidence that comprehensive use of proactive fault management methods can significantly increase the dependability of server clusters and cloud computing environments by an order of magnitude or more.

## II. Call for Contributions

We invite contributions from both industry and academia, covering theory, design, and implementation. Topics include, but are not limited to:
- **Runtime Dependability Assessment and Evaluation:** Reliability, availability, etc.
- **Runtime Monitoring:** For online fault detection and diagnosis, including monitoring data processing.
- **Prediction Methods:** To anticipate failures, resource exhaustion, or other critical situations in complex, distributed, adaptive, or peer-to-peer networks.
- **Predictive Diagnosis and Fault Location:** Root-cause analysis.
- **Online Recovery, Updates, and Upgrades:** Non-intrusive hardware installation and deployment.
- **Proactive Maintenance Strategies:** Short-term and long-term.
- **Optimal Decision Algorithms and Policies:** To manage and schedule the application of actions.
- **Downtime Minimization or Avoidance Mechanisms:** Preventive failover, state clean-up, proactive reconfiguration, load balancing, prediction-driven restarts, rejuvenation, adaptive checkpointing, or other enhancements of traditional repair methods.
- **Proactive Fault Management and Maintenance Techniques:** Monitoring-based replacement, configuration, and management of computer systems and components.
- **Dependability Evaluation:** Models to assess the impact on metrics such as availability, reliability, security, performability, survivability, and user-oriented metrics like service availability, downtime, quality-of-service, and quality-of-experience.
- **Case Studies, Applications, Experiments, and Experience Reports.**

## III. This Year’s Accepted Papers

For this year's half-day workshop, we selected three papers:
1. **Practical Online Failure Prediction for Blue Gene/P: Period-based vs Event-driven**
   - **Authors:** Li Yu, Ziming Zheng, Zhiling Lan, Susan Coghlan
   - **Summary:** The paper compares event-driven and period-based failure prediction approaches using data logs from the Blue Gene supercomputer. The approach is based on Bayesian networks.

2. **Detecting Resource Leaks through Dynamical Mining of Resource Usage Patterns**
   - **Authors:** Huxing Zhang, Gang Wu, Kingsum Chow, Zhidong Yu, Xuezhi Xing
   - **Summary:** The paper proposes using sequential pattern mining techniques to detect resource leaks in source code. It applies a version targeted at Java applications to seven open-source projects with known IO-related resource leaks.

3. **DynaPlan: Resource Placement for Application-Level Clustering**
   - **Authors:** Rick Harper, Kyung Ryu, David Frank, Lisa Spainhower, Ravi Shankar, Tom Weaver
   - **Summary:** The paper describes a technique for near-optimal placement of applications in a cluster and for relocating applications from failed nodes. The technique considers multiple factors such as available memory, power, CPU bandwidth, security, and location.

## IV. The PFARM Game

The PFARM workshop aims to bring together researchers from various expertise areas in dependability through community-building events. One such event is the PFARM challenges karaoke, where participants write down major challenges in the area of PFARM on a piece of paper, which are then collected in a bowl. During the karaoke session, participants are randomly selected to present a challenge and persuade others of its importance. This activity fosters lively discussions and offers new perspectives on PFARM topics.

To address the lack of ranking in the PFARM karaoke, we introduced an online game. Participants can register and receive 100 PFARM nuggets, which they can "invest" in PFARM challenges. The game starts with a list of challenges compiled from the 2009 PFARM karaoke session, but players can also add new topics. The final session of the workshop will evaluate the PFARM game, presenting a ranking of topics based on the number of nuggets invested. The top three "successful" researchers will explain their investment choices, and the workshop will conclude with an entertaining finale.
