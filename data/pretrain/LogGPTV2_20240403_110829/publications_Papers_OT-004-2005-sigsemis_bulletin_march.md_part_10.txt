### 5.2.3 Exploring and Bringing to Maturity the Intelligent Content Vision

#### Overview
The third research theme aims to explore and mature the vision of intelligent content, where multimedia objects integrate basic content with metadata and contextual knowledge about users and environments. These objects will be capable of reacting to various stimuli, proactively interacting with agents, devices, and networks, and seamlessly aggregating to create new, user-tailored content and services. The instruments for this research include Integrated Projects (IPs), Specific Targeted Research Projects (STREPs), and Specific Support Actions (SSAs).

#### Visionary Path (Beyond 2010)
This theme envisions radically new forms of content across all types (audio, video, n-dimensional, etc.) and contexts (commercial, organizational, educational, etc.). Multimedia objects will integrate content with metadata, semantic descriptors, and contextual knowledge. These self-describing objects will learn to react to different stimuli, interact proactively with agents, devices, and networks, and communicate with users and their digital and physical surroundings. They will have the ability to seamlessly aggregate to create new content and services, blurring traditional media boundaries.

#### Research Issues
- **Processors for Intelligent Content Objects:** Develop systems to model and execute complex workflows involving any type of content.
- **Content Rendering Engines:** Create engines capable of presenting diverse content types (e.g., movies and CAD objects) in a single environment.
- **Content Representation and Architectures:** Focus on how such objects can be created, managed, personalized, rendered, and exchanged efficiently and securely.
- **User Control and Content Protection:** Ensure that users have control over their content while protecting it from unauthorized access.

#### Foundational Research
- **Content Creation and Management:** Explore collaborative authoring, automated generation/extraction of metadata, and automated workflows.
- **Personalization and Rendering:** Develop methods to personalize and render content for different users and platforms.
- **Exchange and Trade:** Investigate efficient and secure methods for exchanging and trading content.
- **Knowledge Creation:** Integrate knowledge creation into the content creation process within a unifying framework suitable for various scenarios.

#### Component-Level Research
- **Task-Oriented Components:** Develop components that break new ground in media types and formats, and are scalable in sophistication.
- **Integration and Adaptability:** Ensure components can fit into broader reference architectures and be easily integrated into diverse application scenarios.
- **Open-Source and Development Toolkits:** Encourage the use of open-source shareware packages and development toolkits to support related projects and the wider research community.

#### System-Level Integration
- **End-to-End Systems and Services:** Tie together methods and components to create innovative, end-to-end systems and services, demonstrating their technical feasibility, usefulness, and impact in real-life environments.
- **Performance and Effectiveness:** Address performance, ease of integration, degree of customization, and impact on information flows and work processes.
- **User Acceptability and Training:** Ensure user acceptability and provide training for users.
- **Migration from Legacy Methods:** Tackle the problem of migrating from legacy methods and techniques.
- **Collaborative Knowledge Management:** Stress collaborative methods for knowledge acquisition, management, and use, and support networked organizations and virtual communities of practice.

#### Types of Research
- **Foundational Research:** Advance new formal models, methods, and languages for knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty.
- **Component-Level Research:** Develop a new generation of component technologies for supporting the knowledge/content lifecycle.
- **System-Level Integration:** Integrate methods and components into innovative end-to-end systems and services, demonstrating their technical feasibility and impact.

#### Supporting Activities
- **Standards and Take-Up:** Monitor and assess existing and emerging standards, providing guidance on appropriate sets for designing and implementing complex systems.
- **Convergence:** Drive convergence with other research areas like Grid technologies, developing common approaches, standards, and architectures.
- **User Aspects:** Address broad user issues, including awareness, usability, training, data protection, and privacy.
- **Market Factors:** Identify and understand drivers and inhibitors for technology uptake, market trends, and new business models.

#### Instruments
- **Specific Targeted Research Projects (STRPS):** Suitable for high-risk, high-reward endeavors and component-level research for specific domains.
- **Integrated Projects (IPs):** Preferred for system-oriented efforts and medium-term activities, encompassing all stages of the R&D lifecycle.
- **Networks of Excellence (NOEs):** Focused on long-term, cross-disciplinary research, building communities around new research topics.

#### Maximizing Impact
- **Synergies with Other Projects:** Proposals should complement and extend existing projects, explaining their expected contributions and the practicalities of managing cooperation.
- **Broad Participation:** Involve a wide range of stakeholders, including software houses, system integrators, content creators, broadcasters, and SMEs.
