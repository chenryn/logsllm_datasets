5.2.3 Exploring and bringing to maturity the intelligent content vision
Exploring and bringing to maturity the intelligent content vision, whereby multimedia objects integrate basic content
with metadata and knowledge about users and contexts. These objects will learn to react to different stimuli and pro-
actively interact with agents, devices and networks, and with each other. They will have the ability to seamlessly
aggregate to create new content and services tailored to user needs. Instruments: IPs, STREPs, SSAs
The third research theme provides a visionary (beyond 2010) path towards radically new forms of content of
all types (audio, video, n-dimensional etc.), for all media and contexts of use (commercial, organisational,
educational etc.) whereby multimedia objects integrate content proper with metadata and semantic
descriptors as well as knowledge about users and possible contexts.
These self-describing objects will learn to react to different stimuli and pro-actively interact with agents,
devices and networks and with each other. They will communicate with the user as well as with digital and
physical surroundings. They will have the ability to seamlessly aggregate to create new content and services
for which the traditional boundaries of different media cease to exist. Knowledge will be created while content
is created, within a unifying framework suitable for a variety of scenarios (e.g. multimedia corporate content
as opposed to commercial audio-visual assets).
Research issues include processors for intelligent content objects; systems that can be used to model and
execute complex workflows including content of any type; content rendering engines capable of presenting a
movie or a CAD object in a single environment.
Foundational research will focus on content representation and architectures and how such objects can be:
created, including collaborative authoring and automated generation / extraction of metadata as content is
created; managed e.g. combined by means of automated workflows; personalised and rendered for different
users and multiple platforms; exchanged and traded with adequate efficiency and trust. Consideration will be
given to user control as well as to content protection. Component-level research will provide proof-of-concept
methods and tools for creating, aggregating and communicating such objects, within a unifying framework
supporting different content types, across heterogeneous platforms and networks, in representative domains.
A prerequisite for the intelligent content paradigm is rich, ‘annotated’ content. The overall aim is indeed to
trigger a content / knowledge convergence process by investigating and pushing further ‘smarter’ content, to
progress toward object based workflows.
System-level work should therefore focus on metadata based systems and processes aimed at realising content
adaptable to different users and formats. Promising scenarios include full digital audio-visual production
technologies and processes for interactive digital broadcasting including digital cinema and next-generation
television, as well as programming adaptable to different audiences, formats and delivery channels. The
creative re-use and exploitation of audio-visual resources beyond the original purpose is also included. In
particular, priority will be given to research addressing the move from temporal to data based content
production, and to novel approaches to user control as well as digital asset and production management.
5.3 Types of research
As already mentioned, three broad categories of activity are encouraged: foundational research; component-level
research and development; system-level integration and validation.
All research and development work should address issues such as modelling of user information behaviours
and how to hide complexity from the non-expert user. Projects should maximise cross-fertilisation between
approaches and disciplines, promote open architectures and help build shared infrastructures for research and
training purposes, as well as for technology assessment and benchmarking.
58
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
Work must also promote consistent stacks of standards for semantic interoperability between Web services,
and for data and process descriptions, bringing closer together multimedia coding, metadata and semantic
Web standards and protocols.
Broadly-based foundational research is expected mainly under research themes 1 and 3 and will aim at
advancing new formal models, methods and languages for knowledge representation and reasoning under
uncertainty, to make them more powerful, flexible and durable. Methods and techniques should ensure
interoperability or mapping between ontologies, including multi-lingual and multi-cultural aspects and how
natural languages can be mapped to ontologies, as well as catering for semi-automatic creation, extensibility
and long-term maintenance of ontologies (the ontology lifecycle).
Foundational research will be measured on the basis of its innovation and degree of uptake by the research
community, where the metrics of the scientific peer system will apply. Infrastructure research will be
measured in terms of its contribution to enabling (a) new, advanced applications and (b) broader collaborative
research endeavours.
Component-level research is also most relevant to research themes 1 and 3 and should address the
functionality of semantic-based systems by developing a new generation of component technologies for
supporting the knowledge/content lifecycle, i.e. for operations needed to acquire and represent, analyse,
annotate, (re-)organise, browse, filter, process and visualise objects and resources of all media types.
A long-term, but critical, objective is to achieve the same level of functionality across different data and
media types, improving access to information – for humans and machines alike – and the functionality of
content ‘search and categorisation’ applications.
Components should be task-oriented and should break new ground, for example in the media types and
formats they address, and be scaleable in their degree of sophistication. Components must be able to fit into
broader reference architectures and/or be easily integrated into diverse application scenarios.
STRPS which develop specific components in support of more ambitious efforts undertaken by IPs (cf. section
6. below) would be welcomed. Likewise IPs which develop components to be integrated into scaleable
platforms, demonstrators, working systems are also foreseen. In some cases it will be appropriate to exploit
components as open-source shareware packages or as development toolkits available to related projects and
the wider research community.
Component-level research will be measured in engineering terms by comparison with the state-of-the art.
Tools developed will need to perform significantly better than their predecessors (i.e. faster, more exhaustive,
more cost-effective, robust and flexible) and have a high potential for wide-scale integration into operational
systems.
System-level integration is intended mainly – though not exclusively – for research theme 2 and will aim to
tie together methods and components into innovative (i.e. beyond the state of the art) end-to-end systems and
services, with a view to demonstrating their technical feasibility, usefulness and impact in real-life
environments.
Research will address performance and effectiveness issues, including ease of integration into the working
environment, degree of customisation and impact on information flows and work processes. User
acceptability and the need for training of users will also be addressed. Where appropriate, projects will tackle
the problem of managing a principled migration from ‘legacy’ methods and techniques.
They will stress collaborative methods for knowledge acquisition, management and use, smart portals and
other approaches for supporting networked organisations and virtual communities of practice. Target
applications will have a strong multi-sectoral potential and cater for leading-edge users.
Regardless of the application sector, system test-beds and demonstrators should target a specific user profile
– either the executive, the engineer, the scientist, the analyst or the content/media producer. Proposers should
clearly indicate which profile they address.
Test-beds will prove the successful integration of component technologies into robust, performant and
scalable systems in representative domains, which are readily transferable to other key sectors. Such test-beds
should be:
• ambitious, yet realistic, and address solutions to challenging problems,
• based on highly representative and potentially transferable sectors,
59
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
• feature leading-edge user organisations in the consortium to ensure strong user drive and feedback,
• include an in-depth user requirements phase,
• use real or very representative, realistic data for validation purposes,
• be intuitive, operating seamlessly and transparently, and hiding complexity,
• deal with more than one content type e.g. text and images,
• address a complete end-to-end system or process, or a meaningful subset thereof,
• ensure interoperability with widely accepted industry standards to cater for legacy data and existing
popular platforms,
• clearly demonstrate technical feasibility and commercial / operational benefits.
System-level research will need to show outcomes beyond the scientific and technical results, typically in
its practical impact on the target user groups and wider sectors of industry and society. What direct effect does
it have on users? Is user acceptability and usability higher? Potential economic or social impact? Ease of
integration and customisation, enhanced functionality – leading to improved efficiency and productivity
gains? Will it demonstrate the benefits – and therefore contribute to widespread acceptance and take-up – of
semantic-based approaches?
5.4 Specific supporting activities
The above RTD work will need to be supported by a set of measures, either (a) dedicated Specific Support
Actions (SSAs) supporting the Strategic Objective’s research programme as a whole or (b) within individual
projects. They will essentially aim at:
• standards and their take-up: monitoring and critically assessing existing and emerging standards at the
intersection of Multimedia, WWW, Semantic Web and Web Services areas, providing guidance on the
most appropriate set(s) for the purpose of designing and implementing complex systems,
• convergence: monitoring, exploiting and where appropriate driving convergence with other research areas
such as Grid technologies, where there is scope to develop common approaches, standards and
architectures,
• user aspects: broad user issues including awareness and user/supplier dialogue, usability guides and best
practice, training of leading-edge users, data protection and privacy, etc.,
• market factors: identifying and understanding drivers and inhibitors for the uptake and deployment of
new technologies, market trends and technology foresight, new business and revenue models,
opportunities for global co-operation.
Note, however, that opportunities for SSAs will be limited.
6. Relating research efforts to Instruments
Specific Targeted Research Projects (STRPS) are particularly suited to high-risk endeavours, breaking new
grounds, with high potential rewards. They are also appropriate for component-level research for particular
domains.
Integrated Projects (IP) are the preferred instruments for system-oriented efforts and medium-term activities.
IPs are expected to encompass all stages of the research and development lifecycle, where appropriate cutting
across research themes and addressing system-level integration and validation in realistic scenarios.
Networks of Excellence (NOE) are expected to be used for the longer-term activities e.g. related to new research
topics where a critical mass of research does not yet exist. NoEs should build communities focusing on
longer-term, cross-disciplinary research related to knowledge representation and reasoning, and
understanding of non-textual information.
Specific Targeted Research Projects should target single research problems, especially the development of
truly innovative techniques and new approaches to challenging research problems for the medium to long
term. Consortia of 5-8 partners are likely to comprise partners mainly from academia and public/private
research laboratories. Ultimately, however, the skills mix should be dictated by the scientific and technical
challenges being addressed.
60
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
STRPS are expected to make project results, including source code where appropriate, widely available (e.g. as
open source or via appropriate licensing arrangements) especially to organisations and consortia undertaking
further research in the area. This is intended to ensure the optimum exploitation (in the broadest sense) of
project results and ensure a solid basis for future work.
STRPS are also suitable for the development of system components and domain specific tools, possibly in
support of a complementary IP or STRP – including running projects arising from previous calls. Such STRPS
would typically be driven by industry, including SMEs.
In general, STRP projects are expected to be in the €2-4M range of EU funding, and to last up to 3 years.
Larger STRPs may be accepted where a large, focused effort would clearly have particularly high impact. The
likely impact and exploitation prospects should be very clearly elaborated in the proposal.
Proposals conceived as part of a complementary set of proposals should make clear reference to each other
and specify clearly the expected benefits and synergies of co-operation and especially how such a co-operation
would be implemented and managed in practice.
Networks of Excellence are expected to be in the range of €3-4 M of EU funding, with a duration of up to 3
years. The favoured approach is to drive integration of somewhat scattered research communities by focusing
on a number of specific, longer-term research problems – i.e. engaging in joint integrative research. This
instrument is potentially a very powerful one, but probably also presents the greatest management challenges.
Therefore, a maximum consortium size of 10-12 partners, of which 5-6 are the core partners driving the
initiative, coupled with a task-based programme of work is recommended to ensure the necessary focus.
NoEs will generally be driven by academic research communities but will also cater for industry and user
requirements. Experience so far has shown that industry is reluctant to participate fully in NoEs. However, all
the most promising NoEs in this SO to date do have an industrial advisory board. It is recommended that NoE
proposers adopt this approach. NoEs will be inter-disciplinary and include facilities for exchanging and
testing both human and knowledge resources (e.g. ontologies, tools and reference architectures, evaluation
metrics and data).
Integrated Projects are clearly the most appropriate instrument for large scale demonstrators and test-beds.
IPs should take on board several, if not all the research types mentioned, plus supporting activities if need be.
IPs are expected to be in the range of €6-12M of EU funding over a 3-4 year period, without ruling out the
possibility of more ambitious endeavours. Larger IPs would have to show very clearly that they will make a
definite impact in their target area.
In general, consortia should not be greater than 12 partners, with up to 15 where justified. Smaller scale (i.e.
in terms of consortium, duration or funding) IPs can be appropriate in some cases, provided that they are
clearly focused on achieving their objectives within a time window which is dictated by outside circumstances
e.g. market opportunities.
IPs will bring together a highly complementary mix of researchers with industrial developers as well as SMEs.
Typical consortia will include a central core of 4-6 key partners, who are fully committed to achieving and
exploiting project objectives. The core partners would probably be involved in all work packages and would
demonstrate their commitment by allocating 2-3 full time equivalents (FTE) per year to the project. Additional
partners bringing specific skills and complementary expertise or addressing particular issues (technical,
exploitation, socio-economic…) are of course welcome.
IPs will necessarily include leading-edge user organisations for user drive and feedback.
Given that many of the challenges surrounding semantic-based systems are as much related to technology
adoption as pure S&T issues, IPs should cover much more than RTD tasks and should address user
requirements, test and demonstration, exploitation and dissemination, resulting in a functional ‘system’. IPs
should be active in training both within and outside the consortium (e.g. training integrators and launching
users), organising dedicated training days, seminars and conference tutorials.
IPs are expected to be highly proactive with a professional approach to achieving a high level of public
awareness for the project from the outset. They should actively promote and promulgate reference
architectures built around coherent stacks of standards.
IPs should focus heavily on impact and exploitation of project results acting as catalysts for the wider uptake
and deployment of the technology. This includes proactively making project results available within and
61
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
outside the consortium – including via open source or by licensing agreements. As a minimum, an IP should
make publicly available the proven, system architecture and the outcome of field trials and user feedback.

7. Maximising the impact – Synergies with other projects
Proposals are expected to complement and/or extend the existing portfolio of projects funded under this SO,
especially those funded under the first and second IST-FP6 calls (see http://www.cordis.lu/ist/
directorate_e/kmcc/index.htm), as well as in other closely related Strategic Objectives.
Proposals which intend to cooperate with existing projects to build-on, complement and support ongoing
efforts in a genuine effort to improve the overall impact of the research will be welcomed. Similarly, clusters
of complementary proposals will be considered. Such proposals should explain clearly their expected
contribution to sister proposals and detail the implications of such cooperation both in terms of results, impact
and resources as well as well as clearly describing the practicalities of managing the cooperation.
In the case of overlapping consortia there should be no doubt that the organisations have the necessary
human, technical and financial resources to tackle all work proposed. In any case, each proposal will be
considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that all proposals in a suggested cluster would be
retained for funding.
8. Who should be involved?
The SO constituency is broad and multi-disciplinary. The added value lies precisely in cross-fertilisation
between a number of different areas, including knowledge and Web engineering, agent and database
technology, multimedia and audio-visual technologies, natural language and image processing, etc.
Software houses, system integrators, user organisations active in knowledge-intensive sectors are expected to
be involved in projects aimed at applicative platforms and test-beds. Content creators and aggregators,
broadcasters, mobile and broadband operators, equipment manufacturers are likewise expected to participate
from the content and media sectors.
Private and public information holdings, digital libraries, scientific databases and audio-visual repositories
will all provide rich data sources.
New participants to the programme from academia, research, ICT industry and user organisations are
especially welcome. SMEs and participants from the new Member States are encouraged to participate in all
instruments, and are expected to contribute by using their expertise to bridge the gap between technical
solutions and commercial opportunities.
Nevertheless, quality of the proposal (idea, implementation, exploitation etc.) and excellence of the
participants will remain the key requirements. Each proposal must illustrate clearly the contribution of each
partner in the consortium.
