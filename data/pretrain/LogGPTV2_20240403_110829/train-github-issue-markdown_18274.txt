### Steps to reproduce this issue
We are going to serialize direct to Hessian OutputStream for protobuf
extension, and read directly from InputStream. The change is going to export
the Hessian InputStream & OutputStream for direct write.
    private final Hessian2ObjectOutput delegate;
    protected ProtobufObjectOutput(OutputStream os) {
      this.delegate = new Hessian2ObjectOutput(os);
    }
    void writeBytesForPBObject(Object obj, Class clazz) throws IOException {
      try (OutputStream os = delegate.getOutputStream()) {
        if (obj instanceof MessageLite) {
          try {
            ((MessageLite) obj).writeTo(os);
          } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Google PB序列化失败，序列化对象的类型为" + obj.getClass().getName(), e);
          }
        }
      }
    }
