User: I'm thinking about building a web app that would involve users writing small segments of python and the server testing that code. However, this presents a ton of security concerns. Would docker be a good isolation tool for running this potentially malicious code? From what I've read, checking system calls with ptrace is a possibility, but I would prefer to use a preexisting tool.
Assistant: Docker is indeed very suitable for this kind of usage. However, please note that docker is NOT yet ready for production usage.
I would recommend to create a new container and give non-root privileges to your users to this container. One container per user.
This way, you can prepare your docker image and prepare the environment and control precisely what your users are doing :)
