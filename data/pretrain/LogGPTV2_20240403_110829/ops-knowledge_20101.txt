User: In network troubleshooting, how to check the routing table and provide specific operation steps?
Assistant: Checking the routing table can help determine the cause and location of network failures. The following provides specific steps: 1. Open a command prompt or a terminal window, and enter the "route print" command (Windows system), "netstat -nr" command (MacOS and Linux systems). 2. Check the contents of the routing table, including destination address, subnet mask, gateway address, interface name and other information, especially pay attention to whether the default gateway is correct. 3. Check whether the local network configuration is correct, such as IP address, subnet mask, gateway, etc. 4. If you are using a dynamic routing protocol, you can check whether the protocol status and neighbor information are normal. 5. According to the routing table and local network configuration information, determine whether there is a routing conflict or routing error, and make corresponding adjustments and corrections. In general, routing table inspection is an important step in network troubleshooting, requiring careful review of routing table contents and comparison with local network configuration to determine the cause and solution of the problem.
