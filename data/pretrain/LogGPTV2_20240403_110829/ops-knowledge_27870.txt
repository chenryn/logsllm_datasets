User: How to use SSH (Secure Shell, secure shell protocol) to log in to the server remotely, including the login process and common commands?
Assistant: SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used for secure remote login and other network services in an insecure environment on the network. Below are some steps and common commands to log in to the server remotely using SSH. 1. Configure the SSH server On the Linux machine, the SSH server is enabled by default. If you need to enable or disable the SSH server, you can use the following commands: Start the SSH server: sudo systemctl start ssh Stop the SSH server: sudo systemctl stop ssh Restart the SSH server: sudo systemctl restart ssh Enter the following command on the command line: ssh username@remote_ip_address where username is the username of the server you want to log in to, and remote_ip_address is the IP address or domain name of the server. If you log in to the remote server for the first time, SSH will prompt you to verify the public key, just enter Yes. 3. Commonly used commands The following are several commonly used SSH commands: ls: List all files and subdirectories in the current directory. cd: Change the current directory. For example, cd /var/log will switch to the /var/log directory. mkdir: Create a new directory. For example, mkdir NewFolder will create a new directory named NewFolder. rm: delete a file or directory. For example, rm ExampleFile will delete a file named ExampleFile. cp: Copy a file or directory. For example, cp ExampleFile /var/log will copy ExampleFile to the /var/log directory. The above is to use SSH to remotely log in to the server and some commonly used commands, I hope it will be helpful to you.
