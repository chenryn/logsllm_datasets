FreeCodeCamp streaks not updating unless it is after around 6 PST
Hello Everyone. In FCC for some reason, if I do not get any brownie points
after around 6 PST it does not update for that day. Even if it is after 6 and
I already got 7 brownie points, for some reason it doesn't update unless I get
another.
Here is what I mean:

As you may be able to see I got 9 brownies today and did something for 29 days
but it doesn't update and only shows 28 days and if I don't do something after
6ish I loose the streak.

Thank you in advance!
Cheers,
