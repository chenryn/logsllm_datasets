Setting up the Workspace
If you take the course at a training center, your workspace will be prepared for you.
In the case of self-study, you have to install a virtualization platform (choose VirtualBox 6.1 or
higher) and then download and import a virtual machine: https://edu.postgrespro.com/DEV1-
student-12-en.ova. The virtual machine at this location is regularly updated to reflect any changes in
the training course.
Note that you can only install the VM on a computer with a 64-bit operating system.
The VM runs 64-bit Xubuntu 20.04 as its guest OS, which is already configured for taking the
course. You will need at least 1 GB of RAM. When using pgAdmin 4, you should increase RAM up
to 1.5–2 GB.
Log in to the system on behalf of the student user (for all users, passwords are the same as their
usernames).
The Firefox browser of the VM is set up to display local documentation in English. You do not have
to be online to complete the course.
To manage files, you can use both the command line (ls, pwd, cd, ...) and GUI tools (mc, Thunar
file manager). To edit files, you can choose from several editors pre-installed on the system: vim,
nano, gedit, mousepad.

Course Handouts
The latest version of course handouts is available at https://edu.postgrespro.com/DEV1-handouts-
12-en.zip.
If you would like to download these materials onto the VM, you can click the “Get DEV1
handouts” icon on the Desktop or run the get_handouts.sh script in the Home directory of the
student user. All the files will be installed into the dev1 directory.
If required, you can find the previous versions of the handouts at https://edu.postgrespro.com/.
The main course handouts are available in two formats (only the layout is different, the content is
absolutely the same):
• html is good for browsing and copying code snippets;
• pdf is more convenient for printing.
These handouts include lecture slides, demos, and keys to practical assignments.
Apart from the main handouts, the course also includes some reference materials:
• the list of the main functions and data types (datatypes.pdf);
• a chart of the main tables of the system catalog, with psql commands (catalogs.pdf);
• basic Unix commands (unix_commands.pdf).
All commands in demonstrations and answer keys start with a prompt. We use the following
conventions:
• user$
A prompt that ends with a dollar sign denotes a Unix command; it contains the name of the OS
user that will run this command. For example, “student$” means that the command has to be
executed by the student user.
To run the command on behalf of a different user (such as postgres), enter:
sudo -u postgres command
But it is usually more convenient to open another terminal, run sudo su postgres once, and
then run all commands in this terminal on behalf of the postgres user.
• =>
An arrow prompt denotes a command entered in psql. If psql is not open yet, first run the
psql command on behalf of the student OS user.

Self-Study
If you are taking the course on your own, you should study the topics as they follow, lecture by
lecture.
In-class course videos will be available at https://postgrespro.com/education/courses/DEV1.
Course materials can be used both in addition to the videos and independently. Apart from the
slides, presentations also contain slide notes; they provide enough information to understand the
topic. Besides, there are demonstrations for almost each lecture. Always try out the commands
provided in these demos.
Doing practical assignments is an important part of the course: you cannot learn programming
without writing code. It’s advisable to always look through the provided solutions: they can contain
some additional information, which is not covered in presentations and demos. But do it only after
you have completed the task on your own.
The course includes a series of practical assignments based on the Bookstore sample application:
from designing a database schema to creating tables, views, functions, and triggers. To get a fully
functional application at the end of the course, you have to complete all the assignments marked
with the book tag—it is the basic minimum. But we recommend completing additional practical
assignments, too.
While taking the course, use the provided reference materials. If you are not familiar with the Unix
OS, take a look at its main commands. The system catalog chart can help you understand the
database structure and use psql to get the descriptions of tables, views, and other objects. The list of
the main data types and functions can be used as a “cheat sheet,” alongside with regular
documentation.
Good luck, and enjoy your learning journey!
We’ll be happy to get your feedback at edu@postgrespro.ru.
