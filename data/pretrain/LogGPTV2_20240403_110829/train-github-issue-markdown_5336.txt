Subject: Request for Improvement: Source Ordering Classes in Grid Layouts

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to suggest an enhancement to our current grid system that would allow for more flexible and responsive design options.

Occasionally, the order of elements within the grid needs to differ from the order in which they appear in the HTML markup. To address this, I propose the implementation of source ordering classes. These classes would enable us to rearrange columns on desktops and tablets while maintaining a linearized order on mobile devices, ensuring that the content remains accessible and user-friendly across all screen sizes.

This feature would greatly enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of our designs, allowing for more creative and intuitive layouts without compromising the integrity of the markup.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
