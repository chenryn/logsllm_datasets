Hi
this is a request for improvement :
sometimes within the grid, you want the order of your markup to not
necessarily be the same as the order items are flowed into the grid.  
It would be a nice improvement to have source ordering classes : by using
these source ordering classes, you can shift columns around on desktops and
tablets. On phones the grid will still be linearized into the order of the
markup.
Thanks in advance
