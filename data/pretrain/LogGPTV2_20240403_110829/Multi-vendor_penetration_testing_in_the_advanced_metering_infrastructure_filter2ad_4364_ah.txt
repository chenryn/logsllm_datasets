communications and data management largely contributed to overall cost. Some utilities used

their SGIG projects to upgrade large portions of their communication systems to support 
multiple smart grid technologies beyond AMI. Software testing and systems integration proved 
challenging for some projects, raising the total cost.  
•  Customer outreach and education contributed to overall cost, and varied by project. Some 
utilities experienced push-back from customers that were concerned about the perceived risks 
of smart meter health effects and data privacy intrusions. Smart meter opt-out provisions 
mostly addressed these concerns, and in all cases, opt-out rates were low and did not raise 
deployment costs significantly.

Note: While a larger number of meters installed typically resulted in a lower total cost per meter, one full-scale 
project with particularly high costs can skew the average—resulting in a higher full-scale cost per meter. The data is 
based on a small number of utilities with a wide range of starting points and project activities.  
4.2  Communications Systems that Serve Smart Grid Functions Beyond 
AMI Deliver More Value 
Utilities accrue additional advantages when they design communications networks that have the 
bandwidth, latency, and capacity to serve other needs, such as DA and DSM, in addition to metering 
and billing. Many utilities leveraged high-capacity communications networks to serve a variety of needs, 
including gas and water metering and to offer internet and file transfer services to customers.  
Communications networks are the backbone of all smart grid deployments, including AMI and customer 
systems. Utilities leverage a variety of wired and wireless communications technologies to support their 
smart grid applications and functionalities. As with any other component of their smart grid 
deployment, utilities must consider how a given technology fits with their operational goals, service area 
characteristics, and business process constraints.  
Investment options include wireless mesh, fiber optics, and power line carrier. For backhaul networks, 
some utilities chose to contract third-party telecommunication vendors for access to high-speed cellular 
networks.  
63 
Wireless mesh networks can offer advantages over other wireless network topologies in terms of 
reliability, adaptability, and installation and maintenance costs. Mesh communications depend on 
peer-to-peer communications and are generally better suited to densely populated areas. Fiber optic 
cables offer high bandwidth, low latency, and high reliability, but have relatively higher costs and may 
be better suited to urban deployments that build on legacy fiber networks already in place. These 
systems may not be as compatible with utilities that have hilly terrains or that span large geographic 
areas because of added costs for ensuring adequate radio coverage. 
4.3  Systems Integration is a Critical Linchpin for AMI Impacts and 
Benefits 
Deploying AMI technologies and systems is a complex undertaking for utilities. Implementing these 
new capabilities requires utilities to rethink many business processes and procedures and address many 
new technical challenges involving information management and data communications. For large-scale 
deployments, implementation typically involves multiple utility business units, vendors and contract 
installers, regulators, customers, and local government agencies. Deployment challenges included 
designing communications networks that meet overall system design requirements and enable planned 
deployments, addressing systems integration issues, educating customers about smart meter benefits 
and installation requirements, and addressing customer concerns about the health and data privacy 
issues associated with smart meters. Integrating meter data with other systems and functions often 
required additional development to provide software fixes after the fact, which often resulted in 
unexpected costs and schedule delays. The majority of projects reported that this was one of the most 
important lessons learned about investments in AMI and customer systems. 
For many of the 62 demand-side projects, managing the large quantities of information about customer 
electricity consumption has proven to be a significant challenge. Utilities have encountered issues in 
data transmission, data processing, error checking, and integration with legacy systems. 
Effective AMI, MDMS, CIS, and Billing Integration Greatly Enhance Billing and 
Metering 
Billing and metering services are enhanced when AMI, MDMS, CIS, and billing are integrated and 
operating properly. Service is more accurate with fewer customer queries and complaints, customer 
satisfaction levels are higher, and utility operating expenses are lower. To realize these favorable 
impacts, thousands of access points, communications devices, and meters need to work together to 
form new networks with seamless collections of meter readings and enhanced data processing for more 
accurate bills and data presentments through web portals.  
Successful integration often involves development of new data analytics and algorithms for identifying 
thefts from tamper detection alerts and unusual consumption patterns. Many utilities maintain 
extensive estimated billing processes and procedures that are often no longer needed with successful 
integration of AMI and billing systems.  
Effective MDMS is paramount for ensuring meter data accuracy, successful integration with other 
utility systems, and for serving a variety of smart grid purposes. After communications networks 
64 
AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
deliver interval data from smart meters to head-end systems at utility headquarters, the next step 
involves processing by MDMS for error checking and formatting for CIS, billing, and other system needs. 
For many utilities, MDMS serves as the single repository for all interval usage, register reads, and event 
meter data. MDMS captures and validates all meter readings (legacy meters and smart meters) and 
calculates bill determinants when requested by the billing or customer service departments. In this way, 
MDMS is integral to the AMI billing and metering services function. MDMS can be programmed to 
handle complicated rate structures of all types including time-based rates, incentive programs, and pre-
pay billing plans. 
Participating SGIG projects experienced MDMS integration challenges and lessons learned:  
•  Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) found the integration software it used did not at first export 
meter reads in the format that its MDMS could process. BGE developed “converter” software to 
translate AMI format to MDMS format, which added complexity to the data flow between the 
two applications, but was necessary for the system to operate properly. 
•  Burbank Water and Power (BWP) found it useful to dedicate resources to monitor data quality, 
identify anomalies, and implement corrective actions to ensure MDMS data streams were 
received and used properly by billing, CIS, OMS, and other systems.  
•  PECO took steps to ensure that all interval data processed and sent from meters through MDMS 
to other systems and external parties remained properly time-stamped and synchronized. This 
involved development of audit mechanisms for data validation.  
Lakeland Electric initially attempted to install a revision of its legacy MDMS, which was originally 
used for processing monthly reads to process hourly reads from smart meters. However, 
Lakeland found this revision to be ineffective as a data extraction and validation tool.  
• 
Accurate and timely billing is an essential function for utilities, so successful integration of AMI and 
MDMS with billing systems is a top priority. CIS integration is also important for tasks such as equipping 
customer service representatives with billing data to resolve customer queries and for providing 
consumption and cost data for customized customer web portals. 
The most common interoperability issues occurred when utilities procured AMI, billing, and CIS from 
different vendors and these systems involved different data inputs, outputs, and formats. Such 
differences in data handling and processing frequently meant that utilities needed to develop 
specialized software and data formatting tools to ensure error-free data transfers. These integration 
issues increased costs and had an adverse impact on the project schedule. Other interoperability issues 
arose for utilities when upgrading legacy billing systems to support new AMI functions, rather than 
investing in new ones.  
OMS and DMS Integration Increases the Value of Smart Meters 
Successful integration of AMI with OMS and DMS can boost electricity reliability and customer 
satisfaction from fewer and shorter outages. Meter pinging practices are an essential component to 
realizing these benefits. Integration of OMS and AMI allows the OMS to receive last-gasp and power-on 
notifications from smart meters, and thus display meter outage status to the control room personnel. 
With these capabilities, repair crews can quickly determine the location of outages and nested outages, 
65 
improve outage restoration times, reduce truck rolls, and determine the best course of action to restore 
service to customers. 
Utilities typically customize their outage monitoring and meter pinging protocols to increase efficiency 
and effectiveness and to manage costs. Some utilities use AMI for pinging all meters to make initial 
assessments when widespread outage events are underway, and subsequently use GIS tools to create 
outage maps for monitoring progress as restoration activities begin.  
Many utilities then implement automated neighborhood- or feeder-specific meter pinging focused on 
troubled areas and likely locations for nested outages, which normally take longer to detect and resolve. 
These practices save time following an outage so that control room operators do not have to undertake 
manual pings. Other utilities sometimes turn off the automated last-gasp notifications in the initial 
phase of outage restoration, when the emphasis can be on resolving issues at affected substations and 
transformers and barrages of meter alarms overwhelm OMS screens. Last-gasp notifications are then 
typically reactivated later when major outages have been located and the number of meter notifications 
is manageable.  
AMI-OMS integration typically involves one or more of the following AMI-related functions:  
→  Outage notification, where last-gasp or power-off smart meter alarms are recorded and 
assessed for automatically initiating outage events in the OMS. The power-off notifications are 
typically sent to the OMS and for use with customer calls that have been received to identify 
outage locations.  
→  Restoration verification, where automatic power-on notifications are used to verify service and 
→  Nested outage identification, where small pockets of customers are displayed that may still be 
document restoration times in the OMS.  
without power due to a local equipment issues that may not have been repaired when the 
larger outage was restored.  
→  Restoration time and field dispatch efficiency, where field crews are equipped with smart 
meter and OMS data and displays to accelerate repair activities and better manage labor 
resources and truck roll for restoration activities. 
Customer Systems Integration Involves Interoperability Challenges 
Integration of AMI and CIS with web portals, time-based rates, incentive programs, and customer 
devices such as PCTs, IHDs, HANs, and energy management systems is a new area involving rapidly 
evolving technologies and needs for upgraded standards and data transfer protocols. The process is 
complicated because communications and data transfer straddle the utility and customer sides of the 
meter. 
Most utilities aimed to invest in devices and systems that were interoperable with ZigBee-compatible 
components. Several of the utilities deploying PCTs and IHDs set out to accomplish systems integration 
and data transfer between smart meters and these devices using HANs. In many cases, IHDs were set up 
to communicate with smart meters to display usage information, time-based rates, and critical peak 
event alerts. Other utilities aimed to use HANs to control other customer devices like water heaters and 
swimming pool pumps.  
66 
AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
Participating SGIG projects experienced a variety of scenarios while integrating customer systems:  
•  Florida Power and Light (FPL) used near-real-time energy information from the smart meter’s 
HAN radio in its time-based rate pilot program. FPL found that the HAN technologies, standards, 
and data transfer protocols were still in their developmental stage. The HAN communication 
protocol that was available for pilot use, Smart Energy Protocol 1.0 (SEP 1.0), is non-specific, 
making interoperability or “plug and play” between smart meters and HAN products not 
possible to achieve. FPL was one of many utilities that ran into this issue. 
AMI and DA Integration Boosts the Value of Individual Technologies 
DA assets, technologies, and systems also play key roles in supporting or enabling these new functions 
and capabilities.20 Integrating AMI and DA is thus a top priority and major technical challenge for many 
utilities seeking to modernize grid operations and boost reliability, resilience, and voltage 
optimization.  
Due to fundamental changes in business process and practices from deployment of automated systems, 
staff development and training is a key implementation step. Meters and sensors produce large volumes 
of data to process, store, analyze, and turn into actionable information for grid operators and repair 
crews. Many utilities are implementing more decentralized approaches by equipping repair crews with 
information management systems supported by meter and sensor data to improve work management, 
optimize labor resources and costs, and accelerate service restoration and maintenance and repair 
activities. Utilities are also addressing new needs for cybersecurity protections and interoperability 
needs. 
4.4  Workforce Management and Training are Critical to AMI and DSM 
Success 
Integrating AMI deployment with internal project implementation processes and workforce 
management systems (WMS) is challenging because AMI deployments are complex and involve multiple 
business units. This manifests in the need for sufficient up-front planning, accurate GIS record-keeping 
of meter locations, management of AMI vendors and installation contractors, processes for interim 
billing during meter switch-outs, management of software version upgrades, and transition from 
implementation to operations. Integration activities and lessons learned include: 
•  BWP recommends allowing sufficient time to plan AMI deployments including logistics, asset 
management, records management, workforce management, and integration with 
communications, MDMS, OMS, and other affected systems.  
•  CMP formed a user group with other utilities to share information about problems and solutions 
and provide guidance for specifications to vendors. CMP found it helpful to share project goals 
with vendors because it helped keep implementation tasks and milestones in alignment with the 
project’s overall aims.

67 
•  Pepco experienced problems changing-out meters located in basements or residential garages. 
In some cases, room surveys were required to determine the best change-out approach and 
most effective means for reliable telecommunications of meter data. The communication 
network vendor surveyed hard-to-access meters and Pepco recommends that such surveys be 
done prior to meter installation.  
•  Central Lincoln Peoples Utility District recommends developing a meter numbering system that 
includes establishing GPS locations for all meter locations. This step helps meter deployments 
but also makes integrations with OMS and GIS easier to accomplish.  
Integration examples from the SGIG projects involving project communications and workforce 
management include: 
•  Workforce training (including installation contractors) was effective for several SGIG projects. 
Pepco implemented a successful training program for meter switch-out contractors to repair 
damaged meter sockets. Central Lincoln assigned company staff to support and train contract 
meter installers. PNGC recommends requiring proper training, orientation, and live support 
from AMI vendors, particularly when interactions with customers are required. 
Lakeland Electric and other utilities found that in many cases vendor software did not always 
meet specifications and required version changes, which led to certain features not being 
implemented on time, or in some cases, not at all. CMP found that the need for frequent 
upgrades presented challenges for minimizing disruptions to customers, which meant that more 
rigorous meter testing was required than anticipated. CMP developed a testing protocol 
involving more than 50 meters located in the field.  
• 
•  PECO developed internal and external communications to manage its smart meter deployment. 
Internally it held regular meetings, developed standard messaging, and implemented a 
dedicated intranet page to help with workforce management and training. Externally, PECO 
developed standard messages, talking points, print materials, web pages, and community event 
presentations for communications with the public and local media.  
•  After researching the experiences of other utilities, CMP performed a bottom-up assessment of 
the tasks and skillsets required to support AMI deployments and operations. This effort assisted 
workforce management and helped guide the transition of the metering department to the new 
AMI system.  
•  Duke Energy also focused on transition planning from old to new ways of doing business under 
AMI. Duke’s “turnover to operations” plans were a key part of its project management process. 
Turnover plans require that operation of a specific smart grid capability is not turned over from 
the project implementation team to routine operating departments until new business 
processes have been developed and tested and formal change management procedures have 
been implemented, including sign-offs from appropriate business units.  
Time-based rate and incentive program implementation often requires utilities to develop new 
capabilities and skill sets in areas such as: 
•  Market research to assess customer needs and wants 
•  Marketing and advertising campaigns to recruit customers to enroll in programs 
•  Customers services and call centers to respond to customer queries about new rate and 
program offerings 
68

•  Database management for information on customers and participation and integration with CIS, 
billing, and other systems 
•  Data analysis for evaluating customer acceptance, retention, and responses  
•  Regulatory support for gaining approvals for program designs and implementation activities  
4.5  Cybersecurity and Interoperability Are Integral to Smart Grid 
A key objective of the SGIG program was to accelerate the development and deployment of effective 
cybersecurity protections for smart grid technologies and systems. A cradle-to-grave approach ensures 
cybersecurity protections are built into smart grid technologies and systems. This approach offers 
stronger and longer-lasting protection than security measures that are “bolted on” after systems are 
fully developed and deployed. Cybersecurity was a cornerstone of the SGIG program from its onset. DOE 
required all grant proposals to show how cybersecurity would be addressed in every phase of the 
project lifecycle and how security could be upgraded in response to changes to the threat or 
technological environment.  
Prior to starting work, DOE required each awardee to develop and submit a Cybersecurity Plan (CSP) for 
approval. Plans identified cybersecurity risks and how they would be mitigated, cybersecurity criteria 
used for vendor and device selection, relevant cybersecurity standards and/or best practices that would 
be followed, corporate accountability to ensure successful implementation, and how the project would 
support emerging smart grid cybersecurity standards. Throughout the SGIG program, the Cybersecurity 
Plans and corresponding on-site reviews were DOE’s primary tools for confirming adherence to good 
cybersecurity practices, monitoring progress, building lessons learned, sharing best practices, and 
continuously improving cybersecurity protections.  
The DOE cybersecurity team participated in 311 annual site visits and more than 100 conference calls 
from 2011 to 2015 to monitor progress on cybersecurity implementation. During annual project site 
visits, SGIG cybersecurity team members rigorously reviewed all CSPs and their implementation against 
13 cybersecurity criteria and, as needed, made recommendations. Year-to-year results showed 
improvements in nearly all projects and areas, reflecting a maturation of cybersecurity practices and 
management.  
DOE developed a dedicated, secure website of cybersecurity resources, which served as a central 
repository of tools, guides, presentations, and resources specifically tailored to the needs of SGIG 
project teams. DOE also conducted cybersecurity webinars for SGIG grant recipients and hosted two 
Smart Grid Cybersecurity Information Exchanges, which promoted peer-to-peer discussions of lessons 
learned and best practices.  
SGIG project participants improved their understanding of cybersecurity issues and specific needs in 
deploying smart grid technologies and systems. This was most readily apparent in smaller, utilities that 
saw a dramatic increase in the staff’s sophistication in cybersecurity processes. Although not an SGIG 
program requirement, many utilities intend to continue to modify and use their SGIG CSPs as 
foundations of their organizations’ ongoing cybersecurity programs. 
69 
Interoperability is also critical in a modern grid because it enables two or more networks, systems, 
devices, applications, or components to share and readily use information securely and efficiently with 
little or no inconvenience to the user.21 Since 2009, the industry has made substantial progress in 
tackling key interoperability issues, and the SGIG projects were important for evaluating deployments, 
assessing needs, and accomplishing key activities in accelerating interoperability development. 
Lessons Learned and Best Practices from the 2012 Smart Grid Cybersecurity 
Information Exchange 
SGIG utilities shared valuable lessons learned from implementing their CSPs and shared them with peers 
during the 2012 Cybersecurity Information Exchange. 22 Insights from the SGIG utilities include:  
•  Early cybersecurity planning with product vendors is key. Develop cybersecurity specific 
procurement contract language and consider early engagement of 3rd-party software suppliers 
when planning smart grid investments. Demand that products meet cybersecurity standards and 
define those standards early. Provide strong contractual language in proposal requests. Request 
that vendors take responsibility for security and vulnerability mitigation over the full product 
lifecycle.  
•  Ensure interoperability through robust testing with manufacturers and industry partners. 
Collaborate with manufacturers to develop robust test environments that are fully 
representative of all factors in the field. Become active in national partnerships and support 
emerging smart grid cybersecurity standards. Create interoperability with legacy systems 
through gateway proxies and service buses.  
•  Obtain strong cybersecurity support from executives and managers. A CSP should behave like a 
business plan that includes a budget, defined risk, metrics and evidence, and is written so that 
senior management can understand it. Obtain upfront management support and resources, tie 
security needs to the business strategy, and communicate the business implications of 
cybersecurity investments. Keep executives informed throughout a project. 
•  Eliminate company silos and define clear cybersecurity roles and responsibilities. Undefined 
personnel roles and responsibilities are major obstacles and must be established at the 
beginning of any cybersecurity program. Company “silos” must be crossed so that the 
cybersecurity program is well understood by multiple stakeholders. Employees must work to 
narrow the gulf between operations and IT staff to fully address cybersecurity. 
•  Conduct workforce training to build cybersecurity expertise and literacy. There is often a lack 
of common vocabulary on cybersecurity issues and enterprise-wide cultural change is often 
needed. Utilities should conduct training to build deep cyber expertise for key staff, but also 
support cybersecurity training for all technical staff to promote awareness and familiarity across 
the organization.

4.6  Designing and Promoting Effective Web Portals Involved Several 
Challenges 
Many utilities that deployed smart meters with web portals experienced difficulties attracting 
customers to access and use their web portals. Many customers were either unaware of the existence 
of the web portals or did not bother to enroll and use it. Several SGIG utilities implemented education 
and outreach activities to boost web portal usage with favorable results.  
Simplified interfaces are best; participants found that customers want rapid and often self-guided access 
to the information they need. Examples of SGIG web portal and electronic communications experiences 
include: 
•  Central Lincoln Peoples Utility District’s customers can monitor and manage their energy usage 
through the web portal, which was accessible via home computer or mobile devices. Energy 
usage is presented by year, month, week, day, and 15-minute intervals and overlaid with daily 
temperature. Customers can compare their energy usage to others with similar home 
characteristics, challenge themselves to save energy, and receive alerts when they are using 
more electricity than usual. 
Jacksonville Electric Authority’s web portal includes a web-based tool that provides energy and 
water consumption information and contains utility management tools, billing and payment 
information, and energy conservation tips. 
• 
•  Baltimore Gas and Electric’s web portal enables customers to view bill estimates, receive 
unusual usage alerts, compare their usage to “like” customers, receive personalized usage and 
savings tips, and receive printed and electronic home energy reports.  
•  Entergy New Orleans’ SmartView pilot used web portals to inform participants about how they 
can reduce electricity consumption during critical peak events. In this application, 82 percent of 
customers said they were “very” or “somewhat” satisfied with the web portal’s usefulness as a 
decision-making tool, compared to 94 percent for IHDs and 90 percent for PCTs. 
4.7  Customer Education Improves Demand Response Programs 
Overall, utilities found that they needed to plan customer system deployments carefully and include 
resources for customer engagement and outreach activities. They found that effort was needed to 
ensure that supporting systems are appropriately selected, configured, integrated, and maintained, and 
that targeting and recruitment efforts are properly resourced. Getting customer communications “right” 
is essential for success. Utilities must be prepared to dedicate sufficient resources to the trial-and-error 
of the education process.  
For example, Entergy New Orleans provided three types of training to participating customers: face-to-
face training involved 32 training sessions throughout the city, involving more than 500 customers; over-
the-phone training involved ten conference-call training sessions for about 170 customers; and mail 
instructions to about 2,000 customers, which invited the customer to call the customer support center 
or visit the utility. Initially, Entergy mailed preconfigured HAN devices, but customer calls and home 
visits by customer service agents were sometimes required when participants experienced meter 
synchronization issues. 
71 
5  Future Directions and Next Steps 
The SGIG AMI and customer systems projects invested more than $5 billion in new technologies, tools, 
and techniques for grid modernization. While substantial, this investment represents a relatively small 
portion of the total level of investment that the electric power industry is expected to make in grid 
modernization over the next several decades. The SGIG projects were specifically designed as learning 
opportunities, providing the electricity industry with additional data on smart grid performance and 
lessons learned that can catalyze continued investment in smart grid technologies and systems in the 
coming years.  
The majority of SGIG recipients are building upon initial project results by expanding technology 
deployments, offering successful pilot programs to more customers, or improving the integration of AMI 
with other data and information management systems to extract additional value from deployed 
technologies or activate new smart meter capabilities. 
5.1  SGIG Utilities Largely Plan to Expand AMI and Customer System 
Investments 
In general, SGIG utilities that deployed smart meters system-wide are now planning to develop and 
deploy technologies, tools, and techniques that further enhance customer services. The most common 
planned applications include AMI-enabled pre-pay programs, time-based rates, voltage monitoring, and 
DER and EV integration. Together, these solutions will give customers more options to manage their 
electricity bills, reduce peak demand, optimize voltages, and facilitate customer adoption of DER and 
EVs: 
•  Expanding Pre-Pay Programs: Several public power and electric cooperatives are moving 
ahead with plans to implement pre-pay programs for residential customers. One of the IOUs, 
NV Energy in Nevada, is also planning to implement pilot-scale, flexible payment programs to 
assess customer acceptance. 
•  Offering New Time-Based Rate and DSM Programs: Several of the utilities are planning to 
implement new TOU rates to encourage customers to shift consumption to off-peak periods. 
Others are developing new applications to support better customer engagement in DSM 
programs. For example: 
o  Oklahoma Gas and Electric filed a request, which was approved by the Oklahoma 
Corporation Commission, to roll out its VPP rate offering with free PCTs under an opt-
in recruitment approach with the goal of enrolling 120,000 (approximately 20 percent) 
of its residential and small commercial customers across its service territory within 3 
years.  
o  SMUD is consolidating all pricing tiers to produce a single flat rate for residential 
customers in 2018 and may consider transitioning all residential customers to default 
TOU rates thereafter. 
o  Burbank Water and Power in California is continuing its transition to time-based rates 
with a new tariff for medium-sized commercial customers and implementation of an 
integrated automated dispatch system for demand response programs. 
72 
AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
o  Tri-State Electric Membership Corporation and Cleco Power in Louisiana plan to offer 
new TOU rates to their customers to manage peak demand. Both plan to offer the new 
rates in conjunction with displaying usage data on their web portals. 
o  Sioux Valley Energy is developing an energy management application for smart phones 
to alert customers about critical peak event days. 
o  Baltimore Gas and Electric in Maryland plans to evaluate deployments of Wi-Fi 
thermostats and test whether they are interoperable with the AMI network and result 
in greater peak demand reductions and customer satisfaction. 
o  South Kentucky Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation (SKRECC) plans to introduce 
AMI-enabled time-based rate programs to its members (pending Kentucky Public 
Service Commission approval). SKRECC also plans to expand DLC programs to include 
commercial and industrial customers once the technology options have been fully 
evaluated. 
o  Demand response service provider EnerNOC (formerly M2M Communications) plans 
to expand its irrigation pump DLC program developed under SGIG in California to 
other states. The irrigation load-management program can be customized and 
employed wherever utilities with significant summer irrigation loads desire to reduce 
peak demand.  
•  Expanding Use of AMI for Voltage Optimization and CVR: Several of the utilities plan to 
expand use of AMI-enabled voltage monitoring capabilities for automated volt/VAR controls, 
including CVR:  
o  Central Lincoln Peoples Utility District plans to implement its CVR program system-
wide after the pilot resulted in 2 percent energy savings for all customers.  
o  The City of Fulton in Missouri plans to leverage the AMI system’s voltage monitoring 
capabilities to improve voltage quality across the system. 
o  The City of Naperville in Illinois is working on the deployment of a CVR program for 
energy efficiency and peak demand reduction. 
o  Cobb Electric Membership Corporation is experimenting with the use of remote 
disconnect meters as controls for capacitor banks within its distribution system. 
•  Continued Support for DER and EV Charging: Several utilities plan to leverage AMI systems to 
facilitate customer adoption of DER and EVs.  
o  For example, Glendale and BWP plan to implement new EV charging rates based on 
pilots.  
o  FirstEnergy plans to leverage data from smart meters and distribution line sensors to
