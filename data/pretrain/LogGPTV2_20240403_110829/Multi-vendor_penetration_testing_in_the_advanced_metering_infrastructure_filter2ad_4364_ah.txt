### Communications and Data Management: Key Contributors to Overall Cost

Communications and data management significantly contributed to the overall cost of smart grid projects. Some utilities used their Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) projects to upgrade substantial portions of their communication systems, supporting multiple smart grid technologies beyond Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Software testing and system integration posed challenges for some projects, leading to increased costs.

### Customer Outreach and Education: Varying Costs and Challenges

Customer outreach and education also added to the overall cost, with variations observed across different projects. Some utilities faced resistance from customers concerned about the perceived health risks and data privacy issues associated with smart meters. Opt-out provisions for smart meters largely addressed these concerns, and in all cases, opt-out rates were low and did not significantly increase deployment costs.

### Figure 17: Average AMI System Costs per Meter by Scale of Deployment

| Deployment Scale | Average Cost per Meter |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Full             | $870                   |
| Partial          | $344                   |
| Pilot            | $310                   |

**Note:** While a larger number of meters typically results in lower total costs per meter, one full-scale project with particularly high costs can skew the average, leading to higher full-scale costs per meter. The data is based on a small number of utilities with a wide range of starting points and project activities.

### 4.2 Enhanced Value from Communications Systems Beyond AMI

Utilities gain additional advantages when they design communication networks that support other smart grid functions, such as Distribution Automation (DA) and Demand-Side Management (DSM), in addition to metering and billing.

### 4.3 Critical Role of Systems Integration in AMI Deployments

Deploying AMI technologies and systems is a complex task for utilities, requiring them to rethink many business processes and address new technical challenges. Large-scale deployments involve multiple utility business units, vendors, regulators, customers, and local government agencies. Key challenges include:

- Designing communication networks that meet overall system requirements and enable planned deployments.
- Addressing systems integration issues.
- Educating customers about smart meter benefits and installation requirements.
- Addressing customer concerns about health and data privacy.

Integrating meter data with other systems often required additional software development, leading to unexpected costs and schedule delays. This was one of the most important lessons learned from investments in AMI and customer systems.

For many of the 62 demand-side projects, managing large volumes of customer electricity consumption data proved challenging. Utilities encountered issues in data transmission, processing, error checking, and integration with legacy systems.

### Effective AMI, MDMS, CIS, and Billing Integration

Successful integration of AMI, Meter Data Management System (MDMS), Customer Information System (CIS), and billing enhances billing and metering services. Benefits include:

- More accurate service with fewer customer queries and complaints.
- Higher customer satisfaction.
- Lower utility operating expenses.

To achieve these impacts, thousands of access points, communication devices, and meters need to work together to form new networks with seamless collections of meter readings and enhanced data processing for more accurate bills and data presentments through web portals.

### Lessons Learned from MDMS Integration
