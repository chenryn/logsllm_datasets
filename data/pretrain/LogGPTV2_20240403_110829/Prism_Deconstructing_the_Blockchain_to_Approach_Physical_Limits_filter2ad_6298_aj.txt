D TOTAL ORDERING FOR PRISM: PROOFS OF THEOREMS 4.1 AND 4.2
In Appendix C, we proved three chain properties – chain-growth, common-prefix and chain-quality – for the
Bitcoin backbone under events defined in Equation (18). The voter blocktrees in Prism also follow the longest
chain protocol, hence these three chain properties will directly hold for each of the m voter blocktree under
the corresponding events:
Similar to section C.1, let Hj[r] and Zj[r] be the number of blocks mined by the honest nodes and by the
adversarial node in round r on the ith voter tree for j ∈ [m]. From section 2 and the sorition technique, we
know that Hj[r], Zj[r] are Poisson random variables with means (1 − β)fv ∆ and β fv ∆ respectively. Note that
random variables {Hj[r]}r ∈{0,rmax }, j∈[m], {Zj[r]}r ∈{0,rmax }, j∈[m] are independent of each other. We now
define auxiliary random variables Xj[r] and Yj[r] as follows: If at round r an honest party mines at least one
block on voter tree j, then Xj[r] = 1 , otherwise Xj[r] = 0. If at round r an honest party mines exactly one
block on voter tree i, then Yj[r] = 1, otherwise Yj[r] = 0. Let r′ = k

Let the first proposer block at level ℓ appear in round Rℓ. We will now prove common-prefix and chain-quality
for the leader block sequence defined in Equation (11).
Common prefix property: The common-prefix property of the leader sequence gives us the confirmation
policy. We derive this property using the common prefix and the chain-quality properties of the voter blocks.
Refer Figure 13.
Lemma D.2 (Common-prefix). At round r ≥ Rℓ, if every voter blocktree has a voter block mined by the honest
users after round Rℓ which is at least k-deep, then w.p 1 − εk , the leader block sequence up to level ℓ is permanent

Note the similarity between the above events and events defined in Equation (18). We know that Xj [r − r′, r] and
Yj [r − r′, r] are the number successful and uniquely successful rounds respectively in the interval [r − r′, r] on
the blocktree j. Along the same lines, Zj [r − r′, r] is the number of voter blocks mined by the adversary on the
blocktree j in the interval [r − r′, r]. Events E1, j [r − r′, r], E2, j [r − r′, r] and E3, j [r − r′, r] have corresponding
interpretation of the events E1 [r − r′, r], E2 [r − r′, r] and E3 [r − r′, r].

1 − εk. Each of these voter blocks, bj’s, are mined by the honest users after round Rℓ. Therefore, by the voter
mining policy defined in Section 3, the main chain of the voter blocktree j until voter block bj has votes on
proposer blocks on all the levels ℓ′ ≤ ℓ and all these votes are permanent w.p 1 − εk. Therefore, for each level
ℓ′ ≤ ℓ has m permanent votes and this implies that the leader block at level ℓ′ is also permanent w.p 1− εk. □
Therefore, to confirm leader blocks with 1 − ε security, votes on all the m voter blocktrees should be at least
k = 2
deep. The natural question is: how long does it take to have (at least) k-deep votes on all m
γ
voter blocktrees? The next lemma answers this question.

From Lemma D.1, we see that as r′ decreases, P

inequality (a). The inequality (b) also follows by the same logic. The last inequality (c) is given by Lemma D.1.
Now applying union bound on Equation (25) over m blocktree gives us the required result.
