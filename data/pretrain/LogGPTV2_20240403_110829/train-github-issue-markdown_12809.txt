Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-add-alt-text-to-an-
image-for-accessibility has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and
include links to screenshots if possible.
I have finished the HTML5/CSS waypoints (before the updated extra waypoints),
however, upon redoing them, I am still receiving points.
