considered successful. Otherwise, the attempt is considered
unsuccessful until its status is determined.
Unlike the exposure maps technique, however, LQS uses
two tables (OP S and CP S; see output in Algorithm 1) that
are updated continuously on-the-ﬂy to keep the state of run-
ning services (i.e., open ports) in the monitored network: (i)
the OP S table contains a list of active local network services;
and (ii) the CP S table contains a list of local network ser-
vices that were previously active and later became inactive
(i.e., the most recent response from the corresponding port
indicates that it is closed). Connection attempts to network
services not in the OP S or CP S tables are immediately
counted as scan events.
A remote host r is ﬂagged as a scanner (i.e., inserted in
the table S) in the following cases: (i) r has initiated un-
successful connection attempts to at least k (default value
2) distinct local hosts (i.e., the case of horizontal or strobe
scans); or (ii) at least 4k − 3 (i.e., 1 + 4(k − 1)) unsuccessful
connection attempts are initiated by r to the same local host
but on diﬀerent destination ports (i.e., the case of vertical
scans). In other words, r is ﬂagged as a scanner if it has
initiated failed connection attempts to at least k unique {IP
address, port} pairs. The F C table contains counts of failed
connection attempts for remote IP addresses that made at
least one failed connection attempt.
If a local host initiates a connection to a remote host, the
IP address pair is added to the whitelist CR such that failed
connection attempts from the remote will not be considered
if destined to the same local host (i.e., the remote’s count in
F C will not be increased as explained further below).
Each entry in the OP S, CP S, F C, CR, and S tables has
a “write-expiry” interval such that the entry is deleted when
the given period of time (I1, I2, I3, or I4) has lapsed since
the last time the entry was inserted or modiﬁed.
The LQS algorithm does not ﬂag remote hosts that make
several successful connections as benign. Two advantages
are gained by not whitelisting what appears as benign re-
mote IP addresses: 1) avoiding possible evasion (see, e.g., [10]);
and 2) quickly capturing a remote host change in state (i.e.,
being compromised).
3.2 Design Details
Pseudo-code of LQS is given in Algorithm 1. The function
N ewConnection in line 2 returns true only if a new TCP
or UDP connection is initiated (e.g., the ﬁrst SYN packet
from a remote host is seen for the TCP protocol). Note
that if only SYN-ACK or RST packet is received from the
remote, the connection will not be considered new to avoid
backscatter traﬃc.
The Successf ulConnection function in line 22 returns
true when the destination host responds positively to the
source request indicating an open port (for the TCP proto-
col, a SYN-ACK packet indicates an open port). For each
successful inbound connection (indicating an open port in
the local network), the {local host IP address, destination
port} pair is added to active network services table OP S or
the corresponding entry is refreshed if it is already in OP S
(line 23). If the pair exists in the CP S table, this means
that the network service was previously available (i.e., was
in the OP S) and then deleted from OP S and added to CP S,
due to a previously rejected connection (RST packet) by the
same pair. Therefore, in line 25, the corresponding entry is
deleted from CP S. On the other hand, by receiving a RST
packet from a previously open port (e.g., as a response to
a TCP SYN packet) sent from a local host (as in line 39),
indicating that the host is alive and the port is closed, the
corresponding entry in the OP S table is moved to the CP S
table. Entries in the CP S table are kept for a shorter inter-
val I2 (I2  0) then
F C[C.srcIP ].count ⇐ F C[C.srcIP ].count − 0.25
else
delete F C[C.srcIP ].Contacted[C.dstIP ]
F C[C.srcIP ].count ⇐ F C[C.srcIP ].count − 1
end
if ([C.srcIP ].count = 0) then
delete F C[C.srcIP ]
end
end
else if (RejectedConnection(C)) ∧ ([C.dstIP, dstPORT] ∈ OPS) ∧ IsLocalAddress(C.dstIP) then
add add new entry for index [C.dstIP, C.dstP ORT ] into CP S
delete OP S[C.dstIP, C.dstP ORT ]
end
return (False)

This table contains remote IP addresses having at least one failed
connection attempt. Each remote IP address (i.e., an entry in the ta-

Each contacted local host is linked to a set of destination ports tar-

of the same TCP or UDP ﬂow. To overcome this limitation,
LQS considers any remote host r that is not ﬂagged as a
scanner and that a local host has initiated a connection to
as a non-malicious remote host (the corresponding IP ad-
dress is kept in the table CR) for a time period determined
by I4, during which failed connection attempts initiated by
r to the same local host will not be considered (as in lines
19 and 20).

3.3 Parameterization
Choosing an appropriate value for I1 depends on the prop-
erties of the monitored network and the type of oﬀered net-
work services, where I1 should reﬂect the approximate du-
ration of inactivity, after which a network service is most
likely being stopped or removed permanently from the mon-
itored network (from various experiments on several sites,
the one week default value appears appropriate). Similarly,
the value for I2 represents the expected duration of possi-
ble legitimate inbound activity after the port is closed (the
default value of I2 is one day).
The value of k should be set according to the stability
and availability of the oﬀered services in the target network.
A higher value of k (than the default value) will result in
fewer false positives since a remote host must make more
ﬁrst-contact failed connection attempts with local network
services (i.e., contacting more {local host IP address, desti-
nation port} pairs) in order to be classiﬁed as a scanner. In
contrast, the higher k is the greater the number of false neg-
atives since scanners who contact fewer than k unique pairs
within I3 time window will not be reported. Given that a
connection attempt destined to a pair in neither the OP S
nor CP S tables is immediately considered a failure, even if
the connection might be successful once a positive response
is observed, setting k = 1 could yield a high false positive
rate. In this case, the number of changes in the state of local
hosts’ ports from closed to open represents a lower bound
on the number of false positives.
Testing on various traces from diverse network environ-
ments, we empirically determined a default value of 2 for k
(this is also based on manual inspection of many samples).
The reason that k = 2 represents a good threshold is be-
cause the probability that a benign remote host r contacts
two local hosts on ports in neither the OP S nor CP S tables
during I3 time window is low. Therefore, given that failed
connection attempts are inevitable, even in stable networks,
a remote host making a failed connection attempt will be de-
clared as a scanner only if it makes another failed connection
attempt with a diﬀerent local IP address. k can also be set
to a number slightly above the median number of contacted
local services by a single source address (e.g., the median +
1). In fact, k can be seen as a trade-oﬀ between fewer false
positives and the ability to detect stealthy scans, or detect
scanners faster from fewer connection attempts.
Scanners typically target a particular vulnerable port over
a range of IP addresses, and thus unsuccessful connection at-
tempts to the same local host are considered less malicious,
even if destined to diﬀerent ports. Therefore, by default,
LQS ﬂags a remote as a scanner only if it makes at least
ﬁve failed connection attempts to the same local host but
on diﬀerent destination ports. This threshold is found em-
pirically to provide fast detection of vertical scanners while
signiﬁcantly reducing the number of false positives.
3.4 Further Discussion
While IDS network sensors may skip packets that can-
not be processed in real time, LQS keeps the state of open
ports in the local network in the OP S and CP S tables so
that a connection attempt that the scan detector missed
one of its handshaking packets (e.g., uncaptured SYN-ACK
packet) will not be interpreted as an unsuccessful connec-
tion. However, excessive skipping of packets by IDS sensors
will increase the probability of generating false positives due
to erroneously interpreting some outbound connections as
inbound connections.
Setting up the scan detector behind the monitored net-
work ﬁrewall leads to detecting only the scanning activity
that made it through the ﬁrewall rules. Thus, the scan de-
tector will capture more scanners if it is located at the gate-
way of the network. However, if the detector is located at
the gateway, false alarms are expected for some network ser-
vices. For example, in some applications (e.g., VoIP clients,
IM, and P2P) a local host initiates a connection ﬁrst to a
server, which for some operations may request the client ap-
plication in the local host to listen on a speciﬁc port for
incoming connections initiated by other remote hosts for a
