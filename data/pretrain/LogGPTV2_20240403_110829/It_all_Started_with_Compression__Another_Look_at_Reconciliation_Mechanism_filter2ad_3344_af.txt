the extent to which respondents were aware of the existence of the Commission. So 
respondents were asked whether they were aware of the existence of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission set up at the end of the civil war. Except for 17.7% of 
members of the public, all other categories of respondents, said that they were aware 
of the existence of the Commission (Figure 4). This implies that of the total sample, 
an overwhelming 93.8% were aware of the TRC and only 6.2% were not aware that 
it had been set up after the war. This is not however surprising since much of the 
publicity was centred on Freetown and its environs.

On the sources of their information about the TRC, 41.0% of the elites said that 
they first heard about it on radio and television, compared with 33.3% who said 
they first got to know about it in the print media. The majority of the traditional 
leaders however confirmed that they first heard about the TRC on television. In the 
total sample of the two categories of respondents, that is the elites and traditional 
rulers, 36.6% said that they first heard about the TRC on television, 19.8% said it 
was on radio; 15.8 said it was on radio and TV and only 12.9% said that they got 
to know about the Commission in newspapers and magazines. Significantly, all the 
FGD discussions revealed that participants were aware of the TRC and its activities. 
Another interesting finding is that majority of the traditional and religious leaders, 
63.2%, admitted that although they were aware of the Commission, they were not 
consulted before it was set up, while half of them, 30.3% acknowledged they had 
prior consultations with government. 
9.2 expectations of the Trc
Since the TRC was promoted as a mechanism that would restore peace and stability 
through reconciliation between perpetrators and victims, it was expedient to find 
out the views of respondents on their expectations of the TRC. Not surprisingly, 
their  opinions  varied  across  the  different  groups.  Among  the  elites,  43.8%,  and 
among the members of the public 47.9%, said they expected the TRC to unite the 
victims and the perpetrators, while half of the traditional leaders, 50.0 %, expected 
it  to  bring  peace  to  Sierra-Leone.  Again,  this  is  very  significant  since  traditional 
leaders were also expected to play an important role in the reconciliation process, 
especially in the reintegration of former fighters and perpetrators into their commu-
nities. However, a significant proportion of the elites 34.4%, said they expected the 
TRC to dig out the facts about the issues and factors that led to the war. In the total 
sample, 30.1% of the respondents said they had expected the TRC to unite victims 
and perpetrators. More importantly, only 26.8%, less than a third of all respond-
ents, expected the Commission to bring lasting peace while 20.3% expected it to 
dig out the causes of the war.  The small percentage of respondents that expected 
the TRC to “dig out” the causes of the war is surprising, since telling the “truth” is 
one of the most important prerequisites for “forgiveness” and reconciliation in post 
conflict societies.
The majority of the elites, 62.5%, acknowledged that their expectations from 
the TRC were not met, against 59.6% of the members of the public that said their 
expectations were partially met. Furthermore, an overwhelming number of the tradi-
tional leaders, 74.0% said that their expectations from the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission were only partially met. In short, among all those that participated in 
the survey, 58.2% believed that their expectations were only partially met. Among 
the religious leaders however, 42.3% believed that setting up the Truth Commission 
3
A m a d u   S e s a y
was a good development while another 38.5% believed that peace would not have 
been achieved in the country without the Commission. 
The expectations of the participants of the focus groups discussions (FGDs) 
conducted as part of my research were broadly similar to those of the survey inter-
views respondents. According to one participant, the TRC was expected
…to bring to light the causes and effects of the war”. “to give recommendations for the 
prevention  of  future  conflict  and  to  reconcile  the  conflicting  parties  and  the  victims. 
(FGD 3)
Another participant emphasized the expectation 
that the TRC will create a forum for perpetrators to confess their atrocities and beg for 
forgiveness. We expect that those who bore the brunt of the war would be compensated 
and victims empowered especially the amputees. (FGD 1)
One point that resonated across the board during the FGDs was the feeling that 
their expectations were only partially met. According to one respondent’s opinion:
the whole truth did not come out, partly for security reasons, while other people were 
entertaining the fear of reprisals from the public. The real facts were concealed. So many 
victims forgave but did not forget because they still suffer pains with nobody to assist 
them. (FGD 2)
On what they understood by “forgiveness” a central theme in the truth and recon-
ciliation logic and literature, many of the FGD participants were rather philosophi-
cal as they referred several times to the holy books. However, some were not so sure 
if there could be real forgiveness given the desperate socio-economic conditions of 
many victims of the war.
Although it is difficult to forgive, the probability is still there. We also wrong God and 
he forgives us. Forgiveness always follows true confession, but when there is no confession 
then forgiveness may be difficult. (FGD 4)
However others queried the whole essence of forgiveness in the circumstances of 
post conflict Sierra Leone
What is forgiveness for a widow with so many children that she cannot ordinarily cater 
for? The sight of the combatants inflicts more pain on such people. If our needs are not 
adequately met, true forgiveness will not be possible. (FGD 6)
9.3 The Trc’s methods
On the appropriateness or otherwise of the procedures adopted by the Truth and 
Reconciliation  Commission,  50%  of  the  survey  respondents  acknowledged  they 
were not satisfactory. However, a significant number among the elites, 31.4%, ex-
pressed the view that the processes were satisfactory. Also significant is the fact that 
the majority of the traditional leaders, 76.0%, opined that the methods adopted 
3
D o e s   O n e   S i z e   F i t   A l l ?
were  adequate.  In  the  total  sample,  56.8%  of  the  respondents  believed  that  the 
methods adopted by TRC were adequate while 35.2% felt they were not satisfac-
tory. It is important to note, though, that among the elites, the majority, 63.6 %, 
believed that the methods were not satisfactory because the perpetrators were not 
made to apologize to the victims, while 27.3%, almost a third, believed that many of 
the people that appeared before the Commission were not sincere. All those who ex-
pressed the view that the methods used by the TRC were not adequate also believed 
that only those in big towns had the opportunity to witness the proceedings. This 
was also the view of a Sierra Leonean faculty member at Fourah Bay College, Free-
town, that I had the privilege to interview in February 2006.1 However, only 14.0 
% of the elites agreed with the choice of witnesses, while 64.0% of the traditional 
leaders agreed with the choice of witnesses that appeared before the Commission. 
On the whole, 53.9% of all the respondents approved the choice of witnesses while 
only 24.7% disapproved. 
9.4 Duration of the Trc’s activities
On whether the Commission had adequate time to carry out its activities, the ma-
jority of the elites, 59.0%, believed that the time devoted to the proceedings was 
sufficient while the majority among the traditional leaders, 86.4%, believed that the 
time was not enough. Significantly, the majority of the total sample, 65.1%, were 
of the opinion that the time devoted to the activities of the Commission was not 
enough. In fact, 57.6% of the respondents expressed the view that the Commission 
ought to have been given more time. Moreover, 22.0% of respondents said that the 
Commission had many things to do with very little time, while 20.3% believed that 
some important stakeholders were not given the opportunity to appear before the 
Commission, although they did not identify them.. 
The general disposition of the citizens towards the activities of a Truth Com-
mission is  important for at least two  reasons. First, it is a barometer of  their ac-
ceptance  or  otherwise  of  the  Commission.  Second,  the  success  or  failure  of  the 
Commission and related activities may also hinge on the amount of cooperation it 
receives from the citizens as a whole. Thus it was important to gauge the attitude 
of the citizens to the Commission. In this regard, the majority of the elites, 51.3%, 
believed that people cooperated with the TRC while 28.2% said that people’s at-
titude was antagonistic. Among the traditional leaders, 38.0% said that the public 
attitude was friendly and cooperative while only 24.0% believed that the attitude 
was antagonistic. In the total sample, 43.8% believed that the general attitude was 
cooperative. Various reasons were given for people’s attitudes to the Commission, 
among which was its short duration. Of the total sample of respondents, 48.8% be-

3
A m a d u   S e s a y
lieved that there were more than enough witnesses while another 20.9% said those 
who were ready to witness were never given the chance to do so. 
The ambivalence of the respondents and other Sierra Leoneans towards the Truth 
Commission is not unconnected with the existence of the Special Court side by side 
with the Commission. It was obvious from the discussions I had with several people 
in different locations in Freetown that many perpetrators were not sure of the conse-
quences of appearing before the Commission since there was also a Special Court in 
Freetown to try those accused of war crimes. The existence of the Special Court was 
also cited as one of the reasons some respondents believed perpetrators and other wit-
nesses before the Commission did not tell the whole truth. The simultaneous existence 
of the Commission and the Special Court was also an issue that cropped up during the 
Hamburg interview. The controversy clearly pointed to the dilemma of the guarantors 
of the peace in Sierra Leone. On the one hand, they and every Sierra Leonean were by 
1999 anxious to restore peace in the country. On the other hand, they were reluctant 
to  allow  those  who  committed  war  crimes,  especially  senior  segments  of  the  rebel 
movement and the Kamajors, who were accused of bearing the greatest responsibility 
for the atrocities, to get away with impunity. It was indeed a delicate balance.
9.5 respondents’ understanding of “truth”
One  of  the  more  controversial  issues  in  truth  and  reconciliation  processes  is  the 
different understanding of the “truth”, and establishing when a witness is telling or 
has told the truth. This is partly because “truth” and “telling the truth” tend to be 
culturally bound to a great extent. For instance, telling the truth in a European con-
text may be quite different from in an African setting, and even between groups in 
the same country/state in Africa. More importantly, under what conditions people 
would be inclined to “tell the truth, and nothing but the truth” in an African setting 
may also be subject to both   subjective and objective factors. What were important 
from  the  point  of  view  of  the  study,  then,  were  the  respondents’  perception  and 
understanding of the truth, and whether they believed that the “truth” from their 
point of view, was told during the TRC hearings. This is very important because a 
cardinal requirement for successful post conflict reconciliation under the auspices of 
Truth Commissions is getting to the bottom of what happened especially during the 
hostilities. In other words, establishing the truth no matter how unpalatable it may 
be was a central requirement for forgiveness and ultimately, reconciliation. On their 
understanding of the meaning of truth, and what it is, the majority of the sample 
interviewed, 68.8%, described truth as expressing what one saw as it actually hap-
pened, while only 12.4% said truth is a statement based on facts; whether or not one 
witnessed the events in question. It would appear that most of the respondents had 
a clear idea of what constitutes the truth in any given situation (Table 5).
