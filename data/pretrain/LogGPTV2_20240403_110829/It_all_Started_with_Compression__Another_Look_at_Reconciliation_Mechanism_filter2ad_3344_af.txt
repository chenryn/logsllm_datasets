### Awareness of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)

The study aimed to assess the extent to which respondents were aware of the existence of the TRC, established at the end of the civil war. The survey revealed that 17.7% of the general public were unaware of the TRC, while all other respondent categories, including elites, traditional leaders, and religious leaders, reported awareness. This indicates that 93.8% of the total sample were aware of the TRC, with only 6.2% being unaware. This high level of awareness is not surprising, given the extensive publicity centered in Freetown and its surrounding areas.

**Table 4: Respondents' Awareness of the TRC**

| Category       | n   | %     |
|----------------|-----|-------|
| Elites         | 39  | 100.0 |
| Public         | 51  | 82.3  |
| Traditional Leaders | 11  | 17.7  |
| Religious Leaders | -   | -     |
| **Total**      | 177 | 100.0 |

### Sources of Information about the TRC

Regarding the sources of information about the TRC, 41.0% of the elites first heard about it through radio and television, while 33.3% learned about it from print media. Traditional leaders primarily cited television as their primary source. In the combined sample of elites and traditional leaders, 36.6% first heard about the TRC on television, 19.8% on radio, 15.8% on both radio and TV, and 12.9% in newspapers and magazines. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) confirmed that participants were generally aware of the TRC and its activities. Additionally, 63.2% of traditional and religious leaders stated they were not consulted before the TRC's establishment, while 30.3% acknowledged prior consultations with the government.

### Expectations of the TRC

The TRC was promoted as a mechanism for restoring peace and stability through reconciliation between perpetrators and victims. Among the elites, 43.8% expected the TRC to unite victims and perpetrators, while 47.9% of the public shared this expectation. Half of the traditional leaders (50.0%) expected the TRC to bring peace to Sierra Leone, highlighting their role in the reconciliation process, especially in reintegration. However, 34.4% of the elites expected the TRC to uncover the facts leading to the war. Overall, 30.1% of the total sample expected the TRC to unite victims and perpetrators, 26.8% expected lasting peace, and 20.3% expected the TRC to uncover the causes of the war. The low percentage expecting the TRC to "dig out" the causes of the war is surprising, given the importance of truth-telling for forgiveness and reconciliation in post-conflict societies.

### Satisfaction with TRC Outcomes

A majority of the elites (62.5%) felt their expectations from the TRC were not met, while 59.6% of the public believed their expectations were partially met. A significant number of traditional leaders (74.0%) also felt their expectations were only partially met. Overall, 58.2% of the respondents believed their expectations were only partially met. Among religious leaders, 42.3% viewed the TRC as a positive development, and 38.5% believed peace would not have been achieved without it.

### Understanding of "Truth"

Understanding the concept of "truth" is crucial for successful post-conflict reconciliation. Most respondents (68.8%) defined truth as expressing what one saw as it actually happened, while 12.4% described it as a statement based on facts. This suggests that most respondents had a clear understanding of what constitutes the truth in any given situation.

### Methods and Duration of TRC Activities

Regarding the appropriateness of the TRC's methods, 50% of the respondents found them unsatisfactory. However, 31.4% of the elites and 76.0% of the traditional leaders found the methods adequate. In the total sample, 56.8% believed the methods were adequate, while 35.2% found them unsatisfactory. Many elites (63.6%) believed the methods were inadequate because perpetrators did not apologize to victims, and 27.3% felt many witnesses were not sincere. Only 14.0% of the elites agreed with the choice of witnesses, while 64.0% of the traditional leaders approved. Overall, 53.9% of the respondents approved the choice of witnesses, and 24.7% disapproved.

On the duration of the TRC's activities, 59.0% of the elites believed the time was sufficient, while 86.4% of the traditional leaders thought it was insufficient. The majority of the total sample (65.1%) believed the time was not enough, with 57.6% suggesting more time should have been allocated. Additionally, 22.0% felt the TRC had too much to do in too little time, and 20.3% believed important stakeholders were not given the opportunity to appear before the Commission.

### General Attitude towards the TRC

The general attitude towards the TRC is crucial for its acceptance and success. Most elites (51.3%) believed people cooperated with the TRC, while 28.2% perceived an antagonistic attitude. Among traditional leaders, 38.0% found the public attitude friendly and cooperative, and 24.0% perceived it as antagonistic. In the total sample, 43.8% believed the general attitude was cooperative. The short duration of the TRC and the existence of the Special Court were cited as reasons for mixed attitudes. The simultaneous operation of the TRC and the Special Court created a dilemma, as some perpetrators were hesitant to testify due to potential legal consequences.

In conclusion, the TRC's impact and effectiveness were influenced by the high level of awareness, varied expectations, and mixed satisfaction levels among different groups. The understanding of "truth" and the methods used by the TRC also played a significant role in shaping the overall perception of the commission's activities.
