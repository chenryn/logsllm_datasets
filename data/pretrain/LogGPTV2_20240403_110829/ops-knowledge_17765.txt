Question: "You are a security analyst tasked with finding security vulnerabilities in a large, complex web application. Considering the information from the lecture on bugs and symbolic execution, which two of the following methods would you prioritize to ensure a more comprehensive search for deep, application-specific bugs?"
 "A": "Employ fuzzers to generate a high volume of random inputs, hoping to trigger unexpected behavior and catch simple bugs like buffer overflows."
 "B": "Write an extensive suite of unit tests that cover all known functionalities and past bugs, ensuring that these issues do not reoccur."
 "C": "Use symbolic execution to explore various paths in the application's code, aiming to find bugs that would be difficult to trigger through random testing."
 "D": "Manually review the source code line by line, relying on expert knowledge to identify potential security vulnerabilities."
