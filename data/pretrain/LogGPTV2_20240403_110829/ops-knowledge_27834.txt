User: I want to create an Admin-only page for my GAE application. But I found there's no way to set a Admin user, so I cannot log on the page I created and test the function. I tried the local Admin console, but no luck. How can I do this?
Assistant: When you log in (the blue box where you enter the email) there is a checkbox to apply the administrator flag to your session.
