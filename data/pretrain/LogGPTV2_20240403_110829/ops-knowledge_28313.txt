Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of running tasks in stage 27.0. Task 7.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, and 15.0 were all assigned and ran. The executor found blocks rdd_42_10, rdd_42_11, rdd_42_12, and rdd_42_13 locally. The PythonRunner reported total, boot, init, and finish times for each task. The executor sent 2171, 2427, and 2667 bytes of results to the driver for tasks 7.0, 9.0, and 10.0 respectively.
