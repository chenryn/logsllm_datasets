I understand you are experiencing difficulties with running the `django-admin.py` command, despite having the file located in `/usr/local/bin` and attempting to create a symbolic link. You are trying to start your first Django project by executing `django-admin.py startproject mysite`, but you keep encountering the "django-admin.py: command not found" error. You are using Ubuntu 11.10.

Another user reported a similar issue, where the `django-admin.py` file was located in `~/.local/bin` due to installing Django with the `--user` option using pip (`pip install --user django`).

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Verify the Installation Path:**
   - Confirm the exact location of `django-admin.py` by using the `find` command:
     ```bash
     find / -name django-admin.py 2>/dev/null
     ```

2. **Check the PATH Environment Variable:**
   - Ensure that the directory containing `django-admin.py` is included in your `PATH` environment variable. You can check the current `PATH` by running:
     ```bash
     echo $PATH
     ```
   - If the directory is not in the `PATH`, you can add it by editing your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`):
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/django-admin.py
     ```
   - After editing, reload the configuration file:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

3. **Create a Symbolic Link:**
   - If the `django-admin.py` file is in a non-standard location, you can create a symbolic link in a directory that is already in your `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):
     ```bash
     sudo ln -s /path/to/django-admin.py /usr/local/bin/django-admin
     ```

4. **Verify the Command:**
   - After making the necessary changes, verify that the `django-admin` command is now available:
     ```bash
     django-admin --version
     ```

5. **Start Your Project:**
   - Now, you should be able to start your Django project:
     ```bash
     django-admin startproject mysite
     ```

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about the steps you have taken so far, and any additional error messages you may have encountered. This will help in diagnosing the problem further.
