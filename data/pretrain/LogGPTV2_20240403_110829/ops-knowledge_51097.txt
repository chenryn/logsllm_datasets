User: I have django-admin.py in usr/local/bin and I have tried all the help given on the web to make a symbolic link but it still says django-admin.py: command not found.
I am trying to start of my first project in django :- django-admin.py startproject mysite.
No matter what I do I just keep on getting  django-admin.py: command not found.
I am using ubuntu 11.10.
Thanks
Assistant: i have the same Problem. the django-admin.py for me was in this Path ~/.local/bin.
this because i run pip instal --user django
