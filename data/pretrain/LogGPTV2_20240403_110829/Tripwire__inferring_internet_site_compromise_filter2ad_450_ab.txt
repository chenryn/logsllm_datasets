### 4.3 Crawler

To scale the account registration process, we developed a custom-built web crawler capable of automatically visiting a given site and registering for an account. The crawler operates on a 'best-effort' basis, meaning it does not attempt to support all site registration mechanisms encountered on the web. This is because our experiment is designed as a proof of concept and does not require complete coverage.

#### 4.3.1 Registration
The crawler utilizes PhantomJS [33], a scriptable, headless web browser based on the WebKit engine [20]. It processes pages according to the flow depicted in Figure 1. The crawler attempts to identify a registration page on the site and, if successful, identifies and fills each form field sequentially. If any stage fails, the crawler aborts with a corresponding error code. The crawler does not support sites whose registration systems do not follow this basic flow or those that use external account services such as Google or Facebook. The crawler relies on hand-crafted heuristics to locate and fill out registration forms. These heuristics are implemented using weighted regular expressions and sets of DOM elements. Our current heuristics are designed to support sites written in English.

**Figure 1: Control Flow of the Tripwire Crawler**
Given a URL, the crawler returns a code indicating the reason for termination. If an email address or password was ever shown to a site—regardless of Tripwire’s assessment of the submission's success—we "burn" the identity and permanently associate it with that website. If a registration attempt fails, the identity used may be returned to the general pool for another attempt only if neither the email address nor password were exposed to the website. The horizontal line in Figure 1 indicates the approximate point at which an identity typically becomes permanently associated with a site.

#### 4.3.2 Bot-Detection Avoidance
The crawler bypasses rudimentary bot-checking systems, such as CAPTCHAs or basic human-knowledge questions, by using a third-party CAPTCHA-solving service [5]. The crawler operates through a small network of web proxies maintained solely for research purposes. These IPs are not meant to be unattributable; WHOIS records clearly state our institution's name. The proxies serve to decouple multiple registration attempts at the same site, ensuring that websites receive at most one account registration from a given IP. We did not attempt to match the geolocation of the proxy IP to the address for a given identity, but this did not seem to prevent registration in practice.

#### 4.3.3 Mail Handling
Since many websites require confirmation of email addresses to create an account, our email provider forwards any messages delivered to our accounts to a mail server under our control. This server retains a copy of all messages received and, as needed, processes incoming message contents. Specifically, it evaluates whether a message is associated with a recently-registered account and, if so, whether the message contains a validation link. If a validation link is found, the mail server loads the verification page and saves it for future debugging.

### 4.4 Interpreting Account Compromise
The key assumption in Tripwire is that a successful login reported by the email provider indicates that an attacker has stolen credentials from the site where we registered with our email account. We end our methodology by arguing why we believe this assumption to be valid.

Acquiring the correct credentials requires collecting them either on a machine storing them or in transit between credential holders. Credentials are stored in three places: within our own database, with the email provider, and with the site under measurement. We have taken steps to minimize the risk of data leakage from these sources. Our database is accessible only from a small number of servers on a small internal network, none of which provide externally accessible services. Communication between our servers is tunneled over SSH. Individual instances of the crawler have only the identity assigned to one site, so compromising multiple identities would require full arbitrary code execution on the crawling machine.

The email provider treats the email accounts used in Tripwire equivalently to their hundreds of millions of other accounts and has mechanisms to detect brute-force password attempts. No known breaches of the email provider affected accounts used in Tripwire, and sensitive account credentials were exchanged only between the authors and the email provider via verified PGP.

Perhaps the most compelling evidence of the integrity of the Tripwire accounts is that no accounts were tripped that were not associated with Tripwire registrations. Tripwire has a database including more than 100,000 valid email addresses and passwords obtained from the provider that were monitored for logins but were not registered with sites. These unused accounts serve as honeypot accounts to detect any compromise of the email provider or our own database. None of these unused accounts have ever been accessed.

For the sites under measurement, a possibility is that an attacker brute-forced our credentials without explicitly breaching a site, e.g., an attacker somehow guesses our usernames (or a site exposes them) and the site does not prevent brute-forcing attempts on its accounts. If so, then an attacker could conceivably have found the Tripwire username, brute-forced the password with the site, and then used those credentials in a password-reuse attack on the email provider. While unlikely, we consider this within the bounds of attacks that Tripwire should detect, and Tripwire would correctly declare a site as compromised in this situation.

In communicating with sites under measurement, the system used HTTPS when preferred by the site, validating certificates with a commonly accepted list of roots, and many of the tripped sites used HTTPS during the registration process. It is possible that an attacker may have actively impersonated a site during Tripwire’s registration process. However, we consider this threat to be unlikely, with only a few attacks of this kind having been seen in the wild, primarily due to targeted attacks by state-sponsored actors [16].

Finally, it is possible that a Tripwire account is stored in a sharded database on the site, and only a subset of the shards are compromised in an attack. If a Tripwire account is in an exposed shard, Tripwire indicates that a database breach occurred and detected a significant compromise of the website under measurement. Conversely, if a Tripwire account is not in the shards exposed, then Tripwire will miss any attacks on the affected users (similar to a breach that did not result in password-reuse attacks). Registering for many additional accounts could reduce the possibility of being stored in an unbreached shard, but we consider this possibility to be remote, and additional registrations introduce ethical challenges that are not outweighed by the benefit to this rare case, especially given Tripwire’s otherwise negligible false-positive rate.

### 5. ACCOUNT CREATION
We used the Tripwire crawler to register for accounts in batches between July 2014 and July 2016, with most occurring between January and March 2015. Tripwire made 65,413 distinct registration attempts across 33,634 different sites, using a total of 8,352 identities. We detail our validation methodology below. In our best estimate, Tripwire successfully registered for approximately 3,664 accounts on around 2,302 sites.

#### 5.1 Website Selection
We registered accounts primarily on four occasions from December 2014 through May of 2016. We initially seeded our crawler with the Alexa top-1,000 sites [1] combined with the Quantcast top-1,000 sites [18] (with duplicates removed) in December of 2014. Subsequent registrations occurred from January through March of 2015, covering the Alexa top-25,000 sites. In late November 2015, we attempted registrations on all sites in the Alexa top-30,000. Finally, in May 2016, we manually registered for accounts at all eligible Alexa top-500 sites to ensure good coverage of the most popular sites. In each case, we used the most up-to-date rankings available at the start of the registration window.

In all automated cases, we filtered URLs through a set of regular expressions to remove sites known to use common backends—e.g., Amazon.com, Amazon.de, etc., or Google, YouTube, Blogger, Blogspot, etc.—and others.

#### 5.2 Registration Attempts
Because our infrastructure has no automated way to validate registrations after attempting to create them, there is uncertainty in the number of accounts and sites for which the crawler successfully registered. Hence, we rely on heuristics during the registration process, email-based indicators, and manual sampling to estimate success.

##### 5.2.1 Crawler Termination Conditions
Figure 1 presents the termination conditions for the Tripwire crawler’s execution across various sites. "Required fields missing" indicates that the registration form did not meet the conditions for a valid form (e.g., did not ask for both password and email), or the crawler was unable to recognize a sufficient number of fields to attempt registration. "Submission heuristics failed" corresponds to the case where the crawler submitted a registration but suspects that it did not succeed, while "OK submission" indicates its heuristics suggest it did. Finally, "System Error" represents cases where the crawler was otherwise unable to process the site. We investigate the outcomes of the crawler in Section 7, though we note here that crawler outcome distributions were similar across Alexa ranks.

##### 5.2.2 Out-of-Band Confirmation
In addition to the heuristics Tripwire uses at registration time, some sites provide further confirmation of registration via email. If an email account receives an account verification message, we label it "Email verified." If the account receives email, but we do not recognize it as a verification message, we label the account "Email received." Over 47% of "OK submission" results at registration time triggered a verification message, and 4% more triggered at least some kind of email message. Fewer than 8% of the registration attempts of the other categories resulted in any kind of email message.

While it is possible that registrations could also be verified by phone, no phone verification occurred in our sample. We did receive 18 calls from seven distinct self-identifying sources ("Hi, this is John from site X") to our phone numbers that were directly attributable to the accounts we registered. (We received several additional phone calls, but they seemed to be wrong numbers or call-center scams that cannot be conclusively tied to the phone numbers used in Tripwire accounts.) All attributable calls were sales teams following up on what appear to be free-trial accounts for which Tripwire registered.

##### 5.2.3 Success Estimation
After accounting for email reception, we have five distinct outcome categories shown in Table 1. We manually tested a random sample from each category to determine their expected success rates as a basis for estimating the number of accounts and sites for which registration succeeded.

### 6. COMPROMISES DETECTED
At various points during our study, our email provider reported any successful login activity for Tripwire email accounts. (For non-technical reasons, we were unable to collect login information on a periodic or real-time basis.) As discussed in Section 4.4, we interpret a successful account login as indicating a compromise of the associated site. Among the estimated 2,302 sites with successful account registrations, Tripwire detected 19 such site compromises between June 2015 and February 1, 2017.

**Figure 2: Registration and Login Activity to Email Accounts Stolen from Compromised Sites**
Each row corresponds to a compromised site, and different colors on the same row indicate activity on different accounts at that site. The numbers along the right y-axis indicate the total number of logins for that site across all accounts. The shaded region in Spring 2015 corresponds to a gap in our logs.

#### 6.1.1 Site Characteristics
The compromised sites cover a wide range in terms of popularity. The detected compromised sites are distributed throughout our covered site ranking, from a top-500 site through the full range of sites selected.
