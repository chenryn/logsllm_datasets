I'm implementing a custom BufferAggregator. The doc in the code level is
pretty good! I just have extra questions that, as a dev user, could ask:
  * ~~What doesbuf actually hold? Are they bytes of metrics or bytes of aggregators?~~
  * When we say "Implementations must not change the position, limit or mark of the given buffer", do we always want to use `buf.duplicate();` or `buf.slice()` as the first statement in implementation? Why does the position of the given buffer could possibly be non-zero? Is it because the same byteBuffer has been used in initialization of other kinds of aggregators? If so, when did the init happen?
  * What's the difference between `Aggregator` and `BuffereAggregator`? Is `Aggregator` post agg and `BufferAggregator` non-post agg?
