User: Please explain what containerization is and provide a Dockerfile for building a simple web application based on the following description. Containerization is a virtualization technology that packages an application and all its dependencies into a single running environment for rapid deployment and migration of applications. Applications running in a container are highly isolated and portable, and can run on any compatible host with a consistent operating environment. Docker is a popular containerization platform that defines the container environment and application configuration by using a Dockerfile file. Please provide a Dockerfile for building a simple web application written using Node.js and the Express framework that listens on port 80 and returns a "Hello, world!" message when visiting the root URL.
Assistant: The following is a simple Dockerfile for building a Node.js and Express framework web application: ``` FROM node:latest WORKDIR /app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . . EXPOSE 80 CMD [ "npm", "start"] ``` In the Dockerfile, we first selected a base image as our application environment, using the latest Node.js image. We then set up a working directory for copying the application code and dependencies into the container. Next, we copied the package.json and package-lock.json files and installed all dependencies using the npm install command. Then, we copy the application code into the container. Finally, we expose port 80 and set the application's startup command npm start. Using this Dockerfile, we can build a Docker image of the application and run it in a container.
