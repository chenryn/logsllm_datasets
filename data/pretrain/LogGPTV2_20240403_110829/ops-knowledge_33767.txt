The provided system log contains 20 lines, each with a timestamp, log level, process ID, relevant software component, and the log content. Here is a step-by-step summary of the log:

1. **FastLeaderElection Timeouts:**
   - The `FastLeaderElection` component is experiencing notification timeouts every 60,000 milliseconds (1 minute). This occurs at the following timestamps:
     - 2015-08-24 22:25:14
     - 2015-08-24 22:49:14
     - 2015-08-24 23:04:14
     - 2015-08-24 23:25:14
     - 2015-08-24 23:26:14
     - 2015-08-25 00:23:14
     - 2015-08-25 00:42:14

2. **QuorumCnxManager Connection Issues:**
   - The `QuorumCnxManager` component is unable to open channels to specific election addresses. The issues are as follows:
     - **Address /10.10.34.13:3888 (Node 3):**
       - 2015-08-24 22:32:14
       - 2015-08-24 22:39:14
       - 2015-08-24 22:45:14
       - 2015-08-24 23:09:14
       - 2015-08-25 00:00:14
     - **Address /10.10.34.12:3888 (Node 2):**
       - 2015-08-24 22:42:14
       - 2015-08 -24 22:48:14
       - 2015-08-24 22:57:14
       - 2015-08-24 23:38:14
       - 2015-08-24 23:58:14
       - 2015-08-25 00:14:14
       - 2015-08-25 00:26:14
       - 2015-08-25 00:28:14

### Summary:
- The `FastLeaderElection` component is repeatedly timing out every 60,000 milliseconds.
- The `QuorumCnxManager` component is failing to establish connections to two specific nodes (Node 2 at /10.10.34.12:3888 and Node 3 at /10.10.34.13:3888) multiple times over the period from 22:25:14 on 2015-08-24 to 00:42:14 on 2015-08-25.

This pattern suggests potential network or configuration issues that are preventing the `QuorumCnxManager` from establishing the necessary connections, which in turn may be contributing to the `FastLeaderElection` timeouts.
