### Test Case Execution and Connectivity Impairment
Following the execution of test cases on a per-target basis, subsequent tests should be skipped if a target's connectivity is impaired.

### Urgent Pointer Test Failure Rate
Surprisingly, the UrgentPointer test exhibits the highest failure rate among all tests. Specifically, segments flagged as urgent are not being processed correctly. In other words, flagging data as urgent can limit connectivity. Our analysis of the Censys dataset reveals that over 7% of hosts fail this test, with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) dominating the failure ranking. Only about 1.2% of these failures actively terminated the connection with a RST, while the majority silently discarded the data without acknowledgment.

### Alexa and CDN Analysis
In examining Alexa and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), we again find an Amazon Autonomous System (AS) at the top. We randomly sampled the failed hosts to investigate the types of services they offer. At the top of the list, we discovered services proxied by Vegur [14] and Cowboy [4], which appear to be used in conjunction with the Heroku [6] cloud platform. Although we were unable to determine the exact operations of Heroku, we suspect it may use a high-performance implementation that does not support the urgent mechanism.

### Key Takeaways
- **Unknown Flags Handling**: While unknown flags are often handled correctly, they can reduce reachability, especially when set on SYN packets.
- **Urgent Pointer Impact**: The use of the urgent pointer resulted in the highest observed failure rate, as many hosts do not process data segments flagged as urgent. Thus, using reserved flags or setting the urgent pointer can limit connectivity in the Internet.

### Recommendations
We propose removing the mandatory implementation requirement of the urgent pointer from the RFC to reflect its deprecation status, explicitly stating that its usage can break connectivity. Future protocol standards should be accompanied by detailed socket interface specifications, as has been done for IPv6 [31,54], to avoid misconceptions. Additionally, we have initiated a discussion within the IETF to address the issue of missing formal MUST requirements for unknown flags, which could lead to diverging implementations [11]. We also proposed a new MUST requirement to remove ambiguities in the context of future recommended but not required TCP extensions that allocate reserved bits [12].

### Alexa: Does www. Matter?
It is known that `www.domain.tld` and `domain.tld` can map to different hosts [16], such as a CDN host versus the origin server. It is often implicitly assumed that both addresses exhibit the same behavior. However, 4.89% (11.4k) of the Alexa domains with and without the `www.` prefix show different conformance levels to at least one test. This means that while the host with the `www.` prefix can be conformant, the non-prefixed host may not be, and vice versa. Most of these non-conformance issues are caused by TCP flags, which can impact the reachability of the host. Specifically, 53.3% of these domains failed the reserved flags test, and 58% failed the urgent pointer test (domains can be in both sets). Therefore, a website can be unreachable using one version and reachable using the other.

### Key Takeaways
While the majority of Alexa domains are conformant, the ability to reach a website can differ based on whether or not the `www.` prefix is used.

### Conclusion
This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of TCP conformance to mandatory MUST requirements. We uncover a significant number of Internet hosts and paths that do not adhere to even basic requirements. Non-conformance exists at the OS-level, as shown in controlled testbed evaluations: only two tested stacks (Linux and lwIP) pass all tests. Surprisingly, others (including macOS and Windows) fail in at least one category each. A certain level of non-conformance is expected in the Internet, highlighted by our active scans. First, we observe hosts that do not correctly handle checksums. Second, while TCP options show the highest level of conformance, we still find cases of middlebox interference, mostly MSS injectors and option padding removersâ€”primarily in ISP networks, hinting at home gateways. Moreover, and most concerning, using reserved flags or setting the urgent pointer can render the target host unreachable. Finally, we observe that 4.8% of Alexa-listed domains show different conformance levels when the `www.` prefix is used, or not, with more than 50% of these differences attributed to TCP flag issues, which can prevent connectivity. Our results highlight that conformance to even fundamental protocol requirements should not be taken for granted but should be checked regularly.
