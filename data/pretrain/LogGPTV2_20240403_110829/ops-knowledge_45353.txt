User: I need to call a Python script from Labview, someone know which is the best method to do that?
I've tried Labpython, but it is not supported on newest versions of Labview and I'm not able to use it on Labview-2014.
Definitevly, I'm looking for an advice about python integration: I know this two solutions:
1)Labpython: is a good solution but it is obsolete
2)execute python script with shell_execute block in Labview. I think that it isn't the best solution because is very hard to get the output of python script
Assistant: Why not use the System Exec.vi in Connectivity->Libraries and Executables menu?
You can execute the script and get the output.
