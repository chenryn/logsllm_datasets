## Abstract
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks pose a significant threat to the security and trust of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems. These attacks allow an adversary in the VoIP signaling and/or media path to intercept, divert, or even hijack VoIP calls by manipulating the traffic. Traditionally, it was believed that MITM attacks on VoIP could only be launched by adversaries already present in the VoIP path, leading to the assumption that securing all nodes along the normal VoIP traffic path would prevent such attacks.

In this paper, we demonstrate that a remote attacker, not initially in the VoIP path, can indeed launch various MITM attacks on VoIP by exploiting vulnerabilities in DNS and VoIP implementations. Our case study of Vonage, the leading residential VoIP service in the U.S., shows that a remote attacker can become a MITM through DNS spoofing, provided they know the phone number and IP address of the target Vonage phone. We further show that once the attacker becomes a remote MITM, they can effectively wiretap and hijack targeted VoIP calls. Our findings indicate that:

1. MITM attacks on VoIP are more feasible than previously thought.
2. Securing all nodes along the VoIP traffic path is insufficient to prevent MITM attacks.
3. Vulnerabilities in non-VoIP-specific protocols, such as DNS, can compromise VoIP security.

## 1. Introduction
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has experienced rapid growth in recent years, becoming an essential part of daily life for many. According to an IDC report, the number of U.S. residential VoIP subscribers is expected to reach 44 million by 2010. Additionally, VoIP is widely used for mission-critical 911 calls, with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimating 3.5 million residential VoIP 911 calls in 2006. Therefore, failures in providing reliable and trustworthy VoIP services can disrupt society and potentially endanger lives.

VoIP relies on the interaction of several application protocols on the Internet. The open architecture of the Internet makes VoIP protocols more vulnerable to attacks compared to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) are the dominant signaling and media transport protocols, respectively. Most deployed VoIP services, including Vonage, AT&T, Gizmo, and Wengophone, use SIP and RTP. Moreover, all VoIP systems depend on DNS, making them susceptible to vulnerabilities in these protocols.

Previous research has shown that a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker in the VoIP traffic path can intercept, divert, and hijack VoIP calls by tampering with the signaling and media traffic. Such attacks can lead to serious consequences, such as identity theft and financial loss. Since all known MITM attacks on VoIP require the attacker to be in the VoIP path, there is a common belief that remote attackers cannot launch MITM attacks. Consequently, many people assume that securing all nodes along the VoIP traffic path is sufficient to prevent MITM attacks.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of a remote attacker, not initially in the VoIP path, becoming a MITM. Our case study of Vonage, the leading residential VoIP service in the U.S., demonstrates that a remote attacker can exploit DNS and SIP implementation vulnerabilities to become a remote MITM and launch various MITM attacks. Specifically, we find that:

- A remote attacker can crash and reboot a targeted Vonage SIP phone by sending crafted, malformed SIP INVITE messages, causing the phone to send out a DNS query for the SIP server.
- The attacker can trick the Vonage SIP phone into accepting any IP address as the SIP server via spoofed DNS responses.
- The attacker can redirect all calls to or from the targeted phone, becoming a MITM and enabling wiretapping and call hijacking.

Our results show that:

1. MITM attacks on VoIP are more realistic than previously thought.
2. Securing all nodes along the VoIP traffic path is insufficient to prevent MITM attacks.
3. Vulnerabilities in non-VoIP-specific protocols, such as DNS, can compromise VoIP security.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of SIP and the MITM attack. Section 3 describes our investigation approach. Section 4 presents our case study and demonstrates the DNS spoofing, wiretapping, and call hijacking attacks on a Vonage SIP phone. Section 5 discusses potential mitigation strategies. Section 6 reviews related work. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Overview of SIP and the MITM Attack
SIP is an HTTP-like, application-layer signaling protocol used to create, modify, and terminate multimedia sessions, such as VoIP calls, among Internet endpoints. The SIP specification defines several components: user agents (UAs), proxy servers, redirect servers, registrar servers, and location servers. UAs represent communication endpoints (e.g., SIP phones), while proxy servers forward SIP messages from UAs to their destinations. In most deployed systems, generic SIP servers perform the functionalities of both registrar and proxy servers.

The SIP specification recommends using TLS or IPSec to protect SIP signaling messages and S/MIME to protect the integrity and confidentiality of message bodies. However, most deployed SIP VoIP systems, such as Vonage and AT&T CallVantage, only use SIP authentication for protection.
