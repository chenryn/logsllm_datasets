## Expected Behavior
`ListItemSecondaryAction` should be able to be `hidden` by default, then
`visible` on hover. This is a really common use case, so if possible, we
should consider a clean way to make this (optional) behavior available behind
a boolean property.
## Current Behavior
When implemented with css sibling selectors and hovering over the secondary
action, the icon blinks continuously. When hovered anywhere else on the
`ListItem`, the blinking stops and works as expected.

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Using css sibling selector (shown above): https://codesandbox.io/s/xo0mmyv2oo
## Context
Secondary actions visible for larger lists (e.g. Google contacts list) can be
overwhelming. Hiding icons until hovered is a common way to declutter user
interfaces.

Any guidance @oliviertassinari @kof as to what the root cause of blinking?
