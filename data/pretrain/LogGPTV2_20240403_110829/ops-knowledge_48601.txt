One of my Python scripts needs to be started with root privileges, but after some initialization, it changes its process ownership using `setuid` and `setgid`. This works well, except for one issue: most files under `/proc/pid` remain owned by root, including the crucial `/proc/pid/io` file. As a result, I cannot monitor the I/O statistics of the process.

Is there any additional method or call I can use to change the ownership of the `/proc` files?

**Response:**

The behavior you are observing is by design. The `/proc` filesystem, particularly the `/proc/pid` directory, reflects the current state of the process, and the files within it are owned by the user who originally created the process (in this case, root). 

When a process changes its user and group IDs using `setuid` and `setgid`, the ownership of the files in the `/proc` filesystem does not change. This is because the `/proc` filesystem is a virtual representation of the process's state, and it retains the original permissions and ownership to ensure that only the appropriate users (e.g., root) can access certain sensitive information.

To monitor the I/O statistics of the process, you have a few options:

1. **Run the Monitoring Tool as Root**: You can run your monitoring tool with root privileges, which will allow it to access the `/proc/pid/io` file.
2. **Use Capabilities**: If you need to run the monitoring tool as a non-root user, you can set the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability on the monitoring tool. This capability allows the tool to trace processes and access their `/proc` files, even if they are owned by root.

Here is an example of how to set the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability on a binary:

```sh
sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip /path/to/your/monitoring/tool
```

After setting the capability, the monitoring tool should be able to access the `/proc/pid/io` file, even when running as a non-root user.

By following these steps, you can maintain the security of your system while still being able to monitor the I/O statistics of your process.
