User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can't access network or printer shares All of a sudden on our network, none of the client machines can see any of the network shares or shared printers at all (XP clients, SBS2003 server), and cannot browse the domain via "My Network Places."  I've looked through the event logs, but don't see anything out of the ordinary.  We've rebooted the server a couple of times with no change.

I feel like it's either a Computer Browser service problem or that it's somehow DNS-related, but I'm kinda baffled...

Assistant: Check the event logs! I cannot stress enough how much this can help in troubleshooting just about any problem in Windows, and is often the last place that people look. If this doesn't already point you in the right direction, then read on...
Using the logs from the client, try to establish a timeframe of when the underlying problem first surfaced.
Using the timeframe established above, establish what occurred on the domain controllers around that time.
Make sure that the Computer Browser, DNS Client and Workstation services are running on the client (also check DHCP if you are using DHCP in your office).
Make sure that the Computer Browser, DNS Server, Network Logon, Server, and Workstation services are running on the domain controllers (also check DHCP if you are using DHCP in your office).
If the Server service is not running on one of your domain controllers, and it refuses to start, it's time for a reboot of that domain controller (a known problem with 2003 servers when they experience a low-memory condition that had me scratching my head for hours earlier just this week when all of a sudden none of the domain members could access the group policies).
Take a closer look at the event logs! If you don't understand an error, search for the error with your favorite search engine. This almost goes without saying, but I'm amazed how many times I've been able to quickly find a solution to some of the most bizarre issues (or at least point me in the right direction) simply by cutting and pasting an error message.
