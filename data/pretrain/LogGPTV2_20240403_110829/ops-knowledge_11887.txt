User: How to deal with DDoS attacks and ensure system availability and security?
Assistant: Here are some ways to deal with DDoS attacks: 1. Implement appropriate network security policies, including continuous upgrades of network security hardware and software. 2. According to business requirements, plan reasonable bandwidth dimensions and capacity, and adopt appropriate bandwidth expansion strategies. 3. Configure network equipment and ensure the stability and reliability of network equipment. 4. Use security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection/defense systems to integrate multiple defense strategies, including attack types, attack targets, and other dimensions. 5. Configure device defense policies to limit access traffic and request frequency, and adopt speed limit and frequency limit methods to reduce the pressure of attacks on the server as much as possible. 6. The mobile application uses CDN services to divert user traffic to reduce the impact of attacks. 7. Use third-party defense cloud services to direct all traffic to the service provider's gateway, take advantage of the elasticity and capacity of cloud services, and upgrade security protection rules in a timely manner according to the situation. 8. Monitor the attack situation of the entire network, timely investigate abnormal traffic and attack sources, and refer to the blacklist mechanism to block threat sources. 9. Multi-level backup and redundant deployment to ensure data reliability and disaster recovery capabilities. 10. Prepare emergency plans, report to the police in time, and quickly switch to real-time protection mode to reduce server load and network bandwidth loss.
