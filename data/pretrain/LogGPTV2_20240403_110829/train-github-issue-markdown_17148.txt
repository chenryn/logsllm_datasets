# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
2 Fancy Zone configs, first triggered by LeftWin Key and second triggered by
RightWin key
By default, my Fancy Zones is configured to roughly:  
5 -> 25 -> 25 -> 25 -> 20.  
Icon Gap -> Email -> Code -> Reference/Browser -> Notes App
It would be great if I could trigger a second set of Fancy Zones:  
40-40-20  
Code/Text -> Reference/Browser -> Pomodoro timer
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Left Windows Key + Arrow Key = Triggers first set of fancy zones  
Right Windows Key + Arrow Key = Triggers second set of fancy zones
