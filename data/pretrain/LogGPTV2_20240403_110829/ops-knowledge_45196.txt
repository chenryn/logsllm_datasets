User: Python have been really bumpy for me, because the last time I created a GUI client, the client seems to hang when spawning a process, calling a shell script, and calling outside application.
This have been my major problem with Python since then, and now I'm in a new project, can someone give me pointers, and a word of advice in order for my GUI python application to still be interactive when spawning another process?
Assistant: Simplest (not necessarily "best" in an abstract sense): spawn the subprocess in a separate thread, communicating results back to the main thread via a Queue.Queue instance -- the main thread must periodically check that queue to see if the results have arrived yet, but periodic polling isn't hard to arrange in any event loop.
