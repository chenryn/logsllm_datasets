by any measurement path. Speciﬁcally, ΩCSP and ΩUP will
be zero if any degree-1 node or any two neighboring degree-2
nodes are non-monitors; moreover, ΩUP will also be zero if
not all non-monitors lie on shortest paths between monitors.
To avoid these trivial cases, we adopt an Enhanced Random
Monitor Placement (ERMP) strategy, which consists of the
following two steps.
Step (i): place monitors to avoid the obvious cases of zero-
maximum identiﬁability mentioned above;
Step (ii): place additional monitors, if available, randomly.
See Algorithm 1 for the pseudo code of ERMP. It is assumed
that the total number of monitors is suﬃcient for step (i)
above. Note that ERMP is only used for evaluating Ω, while
our bounds established in Section 5 are valid under arbitrary
monitor placements, i.e., the expression of our bounds does
not depend on the choice of monitor placement algorithm
or the fraction of monitors (µ/|V |). The optimization of
monitor placement to achieve a desired level of identiﬁability
will be pursued separately in a future work.
Speciﬁcally, it suﬃces to consider the most restrictive prob-
ing mechanism UP. Given the set of all potentially measure-
ment paths Q under UP (here it is the set of all-pair shortest
paths), let Vvw denote the set of nodes covered by the path
between nodes v and w (inclusive). Given a set of existing
monitors M ⊆ V and a candidate monitor w ∈ V \ M , de-
ﬁne V(w, M ) := Sm∈M Vwm as the set of nodes covered by
the paths between w and the existing monitors. We perform
step (i) above by a greedy heuristic. We ﬁrst jump-start the
monitor placement with an initial set of monitors required
to achieve a non-zero value for ΩCSP (line 1); if this initial
set is empty, we select the two monitors covering the maxi-
mum number of nodes (line 3). We then enlarge this set by
selecting a new monitor in each iteration whose paths to the
existing monitors cover the maximum number of uncovered
nodes (line 7), until all nodes are covered by at least one

6.3 Impact on Identiﬁability
6.3.1 Tightness of Bounds
To measure the impact of probing on the maximum iden-
tiﬁability Ω, we need tight bounds on Ω under all probing
mechanisms. Although we have achieved this theoretically
by deriving upper and lower bounds that diﬀer by at most
one (Theorems 18, 19, 20), only the bounds under CAP and
CSP can be evaluated eﬃciently, and the bounds under UP
have to be relaxed by a logarithmic factor to be computable
in polynomial time (see (5)). The ﬁrst question is therefore
how tight the relaxed bounds are.
To this end, we compare the original bounds (Theorem 20)
and the relaxed bounds (5) on a variety of topologies syn-
thetically generated from the models in Section 6.1.1 in two
scenarios, i.e., sparsely-connected and densely-connected topolo-
gies. To make the models comparable in each scenario, we
have tuned each model to generate graphs with the same
number of nodes and (average) number of links. We eval-
uate both bounds on multiple graph instances per model,
each with a ﬁxed number of monitors placed by ERMP,
and present the average lower/upper bounds in Fig. 4 and
Fig. 5. As expected, in both scenarios, the relaxed lower
bounds are quite loose due to the logarithmic factor, but
the relaxed upper bounds coincide with the original bounds
for all graph instances. This indicates that although the
relaxed upper bound minv∈N GSC(v) can be a logarithmic-
factor larger than the original upper bound ∆ in the worst
case, this worst case rarely occurs, and we can approximate
∆ by minv∈N GSC(v) to apply Theorem 20. This provides
a tight characterization of ΩUP for large networks, where
computing the original bounds is infeasible.
6.3.2 Comparison of Probing Mechanisms
We are now ready to compare8 ΩCAP, ΩCSP, and ΩUP.
Comparison Using Random Topologies: Similar to
Section 6.3.1, ΩCAP, ΩCSP, and ΩUP are compared on both
sparsely-connected and densely-connected topologies gener-
ated from the four random graph models. Under each sce-
nario, we generate multiple graph instances from each of
the four models and sequentially place monitors in each in-
stance using ERMP such that the set of monitors grows
strictly monotonically as the number of monitors increases.
8In the case of 0 ≤ Ω ≤ 1, we use the tests in Section 4.4 to
uniquely determine the value of Ω.
We then evaluate our bounds on the maximum identiﬁabil-
ity ΩCAP, ΩCSP, and ΩUP for each graph instance under each
monitor placement.
The average results in sparsely-connected networks are
shown in Fig. 6. The results show large diﬀerences in the
maximum identiﬁabilities of the diﬀerent probing mecha-
nisms: while UP can barely localize a single node failure
even if half of the nodes are monitors, CAP can provide
unique localization even if up to 90% of the non-monitors
simultaneously fail. We also observe that the maximum
identiﬁability is larger for ER graphs and smaller for BA
graphs. Intuitively, this is because while nodes in ER graphs
have uniform connectivity, those in BA graphs have highly
variable connectivity, which creates poorly connected sub-
graphs whose node failures are more diﬃcult to localize.
Note that Ω eventually decreases as the number of monitors
µ increases, as the maximum identiﬁability is always upper
bounded by the total number of non-monitors (σ = |V |−µ);
we have veriﬁed that the normalized maximum identiﬁability
Ω/σ increases monotonically with µ.
The average results for densely-connected networks are
reported in Fig. 7.
In comparison to Fig. 6, both CAP
and CSP achieve greater maximum identiﬁability in densely-
connected networks; in particular, CAP uniquely localizes
arbitrary node failures, i.e., ΩCAP = σ, for all the graph
models when µ/|V | ≥ 45%. Meanwhile, as Fig. 7 shows,
increasing the number of links (and hence the density of
the graphs) hardly aﬀects the maximum identiﬁability un-
der UP. Intuitively, this is because densely-connected graphs
yield more measurement paths between each pair of moni-
tors under controllable probing mechanisms (CAP and CSP),
thus enabling them to identify more simultaneous failures.
In contrast, there is only one measurement path (the short-
est path) between each pair of monitors under UP, indepen-
dent of the number of links in the network. Therefore, UP
exhibits similar maximum identiﬁability for both sparsely-
connected and densely-connected topologies.
Comparison Using AS Topologies: For AS topologies,
we ﬁrst compute the minimum number of monitors required
by step (i) of ERMP, denoted by µc, and then vary the frac-
tion of monitors µ/|V | such that µ ≥ µc for all the topolo-
gies. To facilitate comparison, we use the same range of
values for µ/|V | for each dataset. For each topology, we in-
dependently select 20 sets of monitors using ERMP (only
µ − µc monitors in each set are randomly placed), under
which ΩCAP, ΩCSP, and ΩUP are evaluated.
Fig. 8 shows bounds on the maximum identiﬁability av-
eraged over diﬀerent monitor placements for the Rocketfuel
AS topologies. In the selected Rocketfuel topologies (Fig. 8),
