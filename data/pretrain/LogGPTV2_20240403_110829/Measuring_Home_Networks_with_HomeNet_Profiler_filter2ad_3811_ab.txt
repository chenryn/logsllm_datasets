### Devices and Measurement Accuracy
Devices are active more than 99.5% of the time, making one-shot measurements well-suited for studies involving always-on devices such as home gateways [6]. Aggregating the results of two scans conducted 10 minutes apart does not significantly increase the number of observed devices; 85% of scan pairs still observe at most half of the home devices. Only periodic measurements can capture all home devices. Our findings indicate that it takes approximately eight days on average (with a median of four days) to discover all devices in the six homes we measured. To address the lack of periodic measurements, HomeNet Profiler's survey explicitly asks users to list the devices they typically connect to their home network.

### Set of Devices in Home Networks in France
Using HomeNet Profiler data, we studied the devices connected to home networks in France. We inferred the number of active devices by counting MAC addresses present in the device scan, excluding virtual devices. Given that we only have one-shot measurements, we consider the survey responses as the ground truth for the total number of devices. Although users may misreport the number, we expect most to provide accurate information.

Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution of the number of active devices and the total number of devices across the measured homes, along with the difference for homes where both measurements were selected (i.e., the total minus the active devices). The total number of devices per home ranges from 2 to 29, a wider spread than observed in our testbed. The range of active devices is smaller, with approximately 75% of homes having at most four active devices during our measurements. This aligns with our evaluation, which shows that only a small fraction of home devices are active at any given time. The 'difference' curve confirms that many home devices are not connected when HomeNet Profiler runs.

The size of each household (number of members) may influence the number of devices. For the 400 homes where users reported household size, we found a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.18 between the number of active devices and household size. This coefficient increases to 0.33 for the total number of devices and to 0.37 when considering only laptops and desktops. These results suggest a moderate positive correlation between household size and the total number of devices, indicating that household size should be considered when modeling the total number of devices in a home.

### WiFi Neighborhood
This section characterizes the WiFi neighborhood as seen by end-systems in homes. We first evaluate the accuracy of one-shot WiFi scans using our testbed, then study the WiFi neighborhood of French homes.

#### Accuracy of Neighborhood Characterization in One-Shot Measurements
The set of neighboring WiFis can vary significantly even in short time windows due to lost WiFi beacons. We studied the short-term dynamics of the WiFi neighborhood in six homes, performing 12 consecutive WiFi scans every two minutes. We assumed that the aggregate set of measured ESSID-BSSID pairs in these 12 scans represents the complete WiFi neighborhood during the interval. We then computed the fraction of the WiFi neighborhood observed in the first scan, divided by the total number of ESSID-BSSID pairs in the interval.

To better understand the effect of signal strength, we grouped ESSID-BSSID pairs into ten RSSI bins based on the mean RSSI during the two-minute interval. Figure 3 shows the boxplot of the fraction of the WiFi neighborhood observed, with the x-axis presenting RSSI bins. The boxes represent the inter-quartile range, the solid line inside the box is the median, and the whiskers show the minimum and maximum values. The 802.11 standards do not specify units for RSSI, but all machines in our testbed have the same hardware and software, allowing us to aggregate RSSIs.

Figure 3 confirms that ESSID-BSSID pairs with stronger signals are easier to observe. For example, a single WiFi scan observes no more than 34% of the ESSID-BSSID pairs with RSSI lower than -87, while it captures all pairs with RSSI higher than -76. A single scan is sufficient to collect all strong-signal ESSID-BSSID pairs and a large fraction of those with lower signals. This implies that a single WiFi scan is a good compromise for data collection speed.

#### WiFi Neighborhood in France
HomeNet Profiler successfully collected WiFi results from 1,131 homes in France. Some end-systems lack a WiFi interface or OS support for WiFi scans. Additionally, some access points broadcast multiple ESSID-BSSID pairs, and HomeNet Profiler anonymizes these, making it impossible to determine if pairs originate from the same access point. We considered all ESSID-BSSID pairs other than the one associated with the end-system as neighbor WiFis, studying 7,154 distinct ESSID-BSSIDs in total.

We focused on the 2.4 GHz band, used by 96% of the homes. Neighbor WiFis on the same or close channels (within 4 channels) might interfere. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are non-overlapping and recommended, but 18% of ESSID-BSSID pairs operate on non-recommended channels. Additionally, 39% operate on Channel 11, possibly due to ISPs shipping home gateways with hardcoded configurations.

WiFi neighborhoods in France are generally crowded. Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of the number of neighbor ESSID-BSSID pairs across all measured homes, including all neighbors, overlapping pairs, and pairs on the same channel as the home WiFi. The number of ESSID-BSSID pairs varies widely (from 1 to 52), and more than 75% of homes have an overlapping WiFi neighbor. The actual number of neighbors is likely higher, as HomeNet Profiler misses some low-RSSI neighbors.

The quality of home WiFi depends on the received signal strength. Since end-systems have different WiFi adapters, we compared RSSIs of different ESSID-BSSID pairs measured on the same end-system. After removing community network ESSIDs, we found that in 13% of homes, the end-system has stronger RSSI to a neighboring WiFi that overlaps with the home WiFi. This result is reliable because our testbed evaluation shows that we always observe WiFis with strong RSSI.

### Conclusion
This paper presents HomeNet Profiler, a tool for measuring home networks. HomeNet Profiler scans for active devices and services, observes the WiFi neighborhood, and complements measurements with a user survey. Designed as a one-shot measurement tool, our testbed results show that it captures almost all always-on devices but only a small fraction of on-off devices. The survey is crucial for understanding the full set of home devices. One-shot measurements are sufficient to capture all strong-signal WiFi neighbors and a significant fraction of lower-signal neighbors. Strong-signal neighbors are more likely to interfere with home WiFi or be useful as backup links. The one-shot approach requires minimal user effort, enabling us to reach over 2,400 homes. Analysis of 1,600 homes in France shows that the number of home devices varies widely, with only a small fraction active at any given time. WiFi neighborhoods are also crowded. We plan to attract more users globally and develop an online service to query HomeNet Profiler data, providing an up-to-date view of home networks.
