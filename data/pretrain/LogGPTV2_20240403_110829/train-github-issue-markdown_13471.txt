# What / Why
> I've been unable to install anything (e.g. `npm install npm-groovy-lint`)

## When
  * Every time I try `npm install $packagename`
## Where
  * n/a
## How
### Current Behavior
  * Type `npm install npm-groovy-lint`, see 'The package-lock.json file was created with an old version of npm, so supplemental metadata must be fetched from the registry. This is a one-time fix-up, please be patient...', followed by a long list of packages being checked, followed by an error message:

### Steps to Reproduce
  * Install @npmcli/arborist version 2.9.0 : other versions not tested, as couldn't install anything
  * Have an old lock file
  * Type `npm install npm-groovy-lint`
### Expected Behavior
  * No error, it should "just work"
### Steps to Workaround
  * I modified /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/@npmcli/arborist/lib/arborist/build-ideal-tree.js:717
  * Exact link: https://github.com/npm/arborist/blob/v2.9.0/lib/arborist/build-ideal-tree.js#L717
  * Current git repository link: https://github.com/npm/arborist/blob/main/lib/arborist/build-ideal-tree.js#L727
  * Old code:
            const t = `idealTree:inflate:${sloc}`
            this.addTracker(t)
  * New code:
            const rand = Math.random()
            const t = `idealTree:inflate:${sloc}:${rand}`
            this.addTracker(t)
  * With this change, the error `Tracker "idealTree:inflate:" already exists` went away.
  * It appears that the sloc variable was an empty string two times, leading to a duplicate tracker error message.
