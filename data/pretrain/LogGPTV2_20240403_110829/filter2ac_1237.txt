**Title: Black Hat Asia 2022 - AMSI Unchained: Review of Known AMSI Bypass Techniques and Introduction of a New One**

**Abstract:**

The Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is a built-in API in Windows that enables security products to scan and control various types of content generated by applications and services (AMSI consumers) that implement this API. In recent years, AMSI has gained widespread adoption as it has been integrated into numerous applications and operating system components. Endpoint security solutions leverage AMSI to gain enhanced visibility and control over critical and frequently exploited attack surfaces, such as script engines, Office macros, WMI, .NET, and UAC.

Despite its popularity, AMSI itself presents several security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to bypass its protections. In this presentation, we will review several known AMSI bypass techniques and mechanisms. We will discuss both existing and potential methods for detecting these bypasses or mitigating the attack surface that enables them. Additionally, we will introduce a novel research approach focused on exploiting design flaws in AMSI. This will include the presentation of a new, undocumented, and undetected bypass technique that involves patching the code of AMSI providers rather than the `amsi.dll` itself.

**Key Points:**
- **Overview of AMSI:** A brief introduction to the Antimalware Scan Interface and its role in enhancing endpoint security.
- **Known Bypass Techniques:** A comprehensive review of existing methods used to bypass AMSI, including their technical details and real-world implications.
- **Detection and Mitigation Strategies:** Discussion of current and potential approaches to detect and prevent AMSI bypasses, with a focus on reducing the attack surface.
- **New Bypass Technique:** Introduction of a new, previously undocumented bypass method that targets the code of AMSI providers, offering a fresh perspective on how to exploit and mitigate AMSI vulnerabilities.

This briefing aims to provide a deep dive into the current state of AMSI bypass techniques and offer practical insights for both security researchers and practitioners.
