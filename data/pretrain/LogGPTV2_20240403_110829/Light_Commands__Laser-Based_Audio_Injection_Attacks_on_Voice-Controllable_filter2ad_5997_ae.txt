plore the security implications of such an injection, as well as
experiment with more realistic attack conditions.
6.1 A Low-Power Cross-Building Attack
For the long-range attacks presented in Section 5.2, we delib-
erately placed the target device so that the microphone ports
are facing directly into the laser beam. While this is realistic
for some devices (who have microphone ports on their sides),
such an arrangement is artiﬁcial for devices with top-facing
microphones (unless mounted sideways on the wall).
In this section we perform the attack under a more realis-
tic conditions, where an attacker aims from another higher
building at a target device placed upright on a window sill.
Experimental Conditions. We use the laser diode, tele-
photo lens and laser driver from Section 5, operating the diode
at 5 mW (equivalent to a laser pointer) with the same modula-
tion parameters as in the previous section. Next, we placed
a Google Home device (which only has top-facing micro-
phones) upright near a window, on a fourth-ﬂoor ofﬁce (15
meters above the ground). The attacker’s laser was placed on
a platform inside a nearby bell tower, located 43 meters above
ground level. Overall, the distance between the attacker’s and
laser was 75 meters, see Figure 10 for the conﬁguration.
Laser Focusing and Aiming. As in Section 5.2, it is impos-
sible to focus the laser using the small lens typically used for
laser pointers. We thus mounted the laser to an Opteka 650-
1300 mm telephoto lens. Next, to aim the laser across large
distances, we have mounted the telephoto lens on a Manfrotto
410 geared tripod head. This allows us to precisely aim the
laser beam on the target device across large distances, achiev-
ing an accuracy far exceeding the one possible with regular
(non-geared) tripod heads where the attacker’s arm directly
moves the laser module. Finally, in order to see the laser spot
and the device’s microphone ports from far away, we have
used a consumer-grade Meade Inﬁnity 102 telescope. As can
be seen in Figure 10 (left), the Google Home microphone’s
ports are clearly visible through the telescope.†
Attack Results. We have successfully injected commands
into the Google Home target in the above described condi-
tions. We note that despite its low 5 mW power and windy
conditions (which caused some beam wobbling due to laser
movement), the laser beam successfully injected the voice
command while penetrating a closed double-pane glass win-
dow. While causing negligible reﬂections, the double-pane
window did not cause any visible distortion in the injected sig-
nal, with the laser beam hitting the target’s top microphones
at an angle of 21.8 degrees and successfully injecting the com-
mand without the need for any device- or window-speciﬁc
calibration. We thus conclude that cross-building laser com-
mand injection is possible, at large distances and under realis-
tic attack conditions. Finally, the experiment in Figure 10 was
conducted at night due to safety requirements, with long-range
attacks under illuminated conditions shown in Section 5.2.
6.2 Attacking Authentication
Some of the current generation of VC systems attempt to
protect unauthorized execution of sensitive commands by
requiring additional user authentication step. For phone and
tablet devices, the Siri and Alexa apps require the user to
unlock the phone before executing certain commands (e.g.,
unlock front door, disable home alarm system). However,
for devices that do not have other form of inputs beside the
user’s voice (e.g., voice-enabled smart speakers, cameras, and
thermostats) a digit-based PIN code is used to authenticate
the user before critical commands are performed.
†Figure 10 (left) was taken via a cell phone camera attached to the
telescope’s eyepiece. Unfortunately, due to imperfect phone-eyepiece align-
ment, the outcome is slightly out of focus and the laser spot is over saturated.
However, the Google Home was in sharp focus with a small laser spot when
viewed directly by a human observer.

tower: laser on telephoto lens aiming down to the target. (Right) Picture from the ofﬁce building: laser spot on the target device.
PIN Eavesdropping.
The PIN number spoken by the user
is inherently vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, which can
be performed remotely using a laser microphone (measuring
the acoustic vibration of a glass window using a laser reﬂec-
tion [37]), or using common audio eavesdropping techniques.
Moreover, within an application the same PIN is used to au-
thenticate more than one critical command (e.g., “unlock the
car” and “start the engine”) while users often re-use PIN num-
bers across different applications. In both cases, increasing
the number of PIN-protected commands ironically increases
the opportunity for PIN eavesdropping attacks.
PIN Brute forcing. We also observed incorrect implemen-
tation of PIN veriﬁcation mechanisms. While Alexa natu-
rally supports PIN authentication (limiting the user to three
wrong attempts before requiring interaction with a phone ap-
plication), Google Assistant delegates PIN authentication to
third-party device vendors that often lack security experience.
Evaluating this design choice, we have investigated the fea-
sibility of PIN brute forcing attacks on an August Smart Lock
Pro, which is the most reviewed smart lock on Amazon at the
time of writing. First, we have discovered that August does
not enforce a reasonable PIN code length, allowing PINs con-
taining anywhere from 1 to 6 digits for door unlocking. Next,
we observed that August does not limit the number of wrong
attempts permitted by the user at the time of writing, nor does
the lock implement a time delay mechanism between incor-
rect attempts, allowing the attacker o to unlock the target’s
door is to simply enumerating all possible PIN codes.
Empirically verifying this, we have written a program that
enumerates all 4-digit PIN numbers using a synthetic voice.
After each unsuccessful attempt, the Google home device
responded with “Sorry, the security code is incorrect, can
I have your security code to unlock the front door?” only
to have our program speak the next PIN candidate. Overall,
a single unlock attempt lasted about 13 seconds, requiring
36 hours to enumerate the entire 4-digit space (3.6 hours
for 3 digits). In both the 3- and 4-digit case, the door was
successfully unlocked when the correct PIN was reached.
PIN Bypassing.
Finally, we discovered that while com-
mands like “unlock front door” for August locks or “disable
alarm system” for Ring alarms require PIN numbers, other
commands such as “open the garage door” using an assistant-
enabled garage door opener‡ often do not require any authenti-
cation. Thus, even if one command is unavailable, the attacker
can often achieve similar goals by using other commands.
6.3 Attacking Cars
Many modern cars have Internet-over-cellular connectivity,
allowing their owners to perform certain operations via a
dedicated app on their mobile devices. In some cases, this
connectivity has further evolved (either by the vendor or by a
third-party) in having the target’s car be connected to a VC
system, allowing voice unlocking and/or pre-heating (which
often requires engine start). Thus, a compromised VC system
might be used by an attacker to gain access to the target’s car.
In this section we investigate the feasibility of such attacks,
using two major car manufactures, namely Tesla and Ford.
Tesla.
Tesla cars allow their owner to interact with the car
using a Tesla-provided phone app. After installing the app on
our phone and linking it to a Tesla Model S, we installed the
“EV Car”§ integration, linking it to the vehicle. While “EV

using the vehicle’s owner credentials, we were able to get
several capabilities. These included getting information about
the vehicle’s current location¶, locking and unlocking the
doors and trunk, starting and stopping the vehicle’s charging
and the climate control system. Next, we note that we were
able to perform all of these tasks using only voice commands
without the need of a PIN number or key proximity. Finally,
we were not able to start the car without key proximity.
Ford Cars.
For newer vehicles, Ford provides a phone
app called “FordPass”, that connects to the car’s Ford SYNC
system, and allows the owner to interact with the car over the
Internet. Taking the next step, Ford also provides a FordPass
Google Assistant integration|| with similar capabilities as the
“EV Car” integration for Tesla. While Ford implemented PIN
protection for critical voice commands like remote engine
start and door unlocking, like in the case of August locks,
there is no protection against PIN brute forcing. Finally, while
we were able to remotely open the doors and start the engine,
shifting the vehicle out of “Park” immediately stopped the
engine, preventing the unlocked car from being driven.
6.4 Exploring Stealthy Attacks
The attacks described so far can be spotted by the user of
the targeted VC system in three ways. First, the user might
notice the light indicators on the target device following a
successful command injection. Next, the user might hear the
device acknowledging the injected command. Finally, the user
might notice the spot while the attacker tries to aim the laser
at the target microphone port.
While the ﬁrst issue is a limitation of our attack (and in fact
of any command injection attack), in this section we explore
the attacker’s options for addressing the remaining two issues.
Acoustic Stealthiness.
To tackle the issue of the device
owner hearing the targeted device acknowledging the execu-
tion of voice command (or asking for a PIN number during the
brute forcing process), the attacker can start the attack by ask-
ing the device to lower its speaker volume. For some devices
(EcoBee, Google Nest Camera IQ, and Fire TV), the volume
can be reduced to completely zero, while for other devices
it can be set to barely-audible levels. Moreover, the attacker
can also abuse device features to achieve the same goal. For
Google Assistant, enabling the “do not disturb mode” mutes
reminders, broadcast messages and other spoken notiﬁcations.
For Amazon Echo devices, enabling “whisper mode” signiﬁ-
cantly reduces the volume of the device responses during the
attack to almost inaudible levels.
Optical Stealthiness.
The attacker can use an invisible
laser wavelength to avoid having the owner spot the laser light
aimed at the target device. However, as the laser spot is also
¶Admittedly, the audible location is of little use to a remote attacker who
is unable to listen in on the speaker’s output.

invisible to the attacker, a camera sensitive to the appropriate
wavelength is required for aiming. Experimentally verifying
this, we replicated the attack on Google Home device from
Section 5.1 using a 980-nm infrared laser (Lilly Electronics 30
mW laser module). We then connected the laser to a Thorlabs
LDC205C driver, limiting its power to 5 mW. Finally, as the
spot created by infrared lasers is invisible to humans, we
aimed the laser using a smartphone camera (as these typically
do not contain infrared ﬁlters).
Using this setup, we have successfully injected voice com-
mands to a Google Home at a distance of about 30 centimeters
in the same setup as Section 5.1. The spot created by the in-
frared laser was barely visible using the phone camera, and
completely invisible to the human eye. Finally, not wanting
to risk prolonged exposure to invisible (but eye damaging)
laser beams, we did not perform range experiments with this
setup. However, given the color insensitivity described in Sec-
tion 4.1, we conjecture that results similar to those obtained
in Section 5.2 could be obtained here as well.
6.5 Avoiding the Need for Precise Aiming
Another limitation of the attacks described so far is the need
to aim the laser spot precisely on the target’s microphone
ports. While we achieved such aiming in Section 6.1 by using
geared camera tripod heads, in this section we show how the
need for precise aiming can be avoided altogether.
An attacker can use a higher-power laser and trade its power
with a larger laser spot size, which makes aiming considerably
easier. Indeed, laser modules higher than 4W are commonly
available on common e-commerce sites for laser engraving.
Since we could not test such a high-power laser in an open-
air environment due to safety concerns, we decided to use a
laser-excited phosphor ﬂashlight (Acebeam W30 with 500
lumens), which is technically a laser but sold as a ﬂashlight

Diode terminalsof the flashlightLight spot coveringthe entire target10 mTargetMicrophoneholeswith beam-expanding optics (making it a class 3B system).
To allow for voice modulation, we modiﬁed the ﬂashlight
by removing its original current driver and connecting its
diode terminals to the Thorlabs LDC240C laser driver (see
Figure 11). Then, the experimental setup of Section 5.2 is
replicated except that the laser diode and telephoto lens is
replaced with the ﬂashlight. Using this setup, we successfully
injected commands to a Google Home device at a range of
about 10 meters, while running the ﬂashlight at an output
power of 1 W. Next, as can be seen in Figure 11, the beam spot
created by the ﬂashlight is large enough to cover the entire
target (and its microphone ports) without the need to use
additional focusing optics and aiming equipment. However,
we note that while the large spot size helps for imprecise
aiming, the ﬂashlight’s quickly diverging beam also limits the
attack’s maximum range.
Finally, the large spot size created by the ﬂashlight (cover-
ing the entire device surface) can also be used to inject the
sound into to multiple microphones simultaneously, thereby
potentially defeating software-based anomaly detection coun-
termeasures described in Section 7.
6.6 Reducing the Attack Costs
While the setups used for all the attacks described in this paper
are built using readily available components, some equipment
(such as the laser driver and diodes) are intended for lab use,
making assembly and testing somewhat difﬁcult for a non-
experienced user. In this section we present a low-cost setup
that can be easily constructed using improvised means and
off-the-shelf consumer components.
Laser Diode and Optics. Modifying off-the-shelf laser
pointers can be an easy way to get a laser source with colli-
mation optics. In particular, cheap laser pointers often have
no current regulators, having their anodes and cathodes di-
rectly connected to the batteries. Thus, we can easily connect
a current driver to the pointer’s battery connectors via alliga-
tor clips. Figure 12 shows a cheap laser pointer based setup,
available at $18 for 3 pieces at Amazon.
Laser Driver. The laser current driver with analog modula-
tion port is the most specialized instrument of our setup, as we
used the scientiﬁc-grade laser drivers that cost about $1,500.
However, cheaper alternatives exist, such as the Wavelength
Electronics LD5CHA driver available for about $300.
Sound Source and Experimental Results.
Finally, the at-
tacker needs a method for playing recorded audio commands.
We used an ordinary on-board laptop sound card (Dell XPS
15 9570), ampliﬁed using a Neoteck NTK059 Headphone
Ampliﬁer ($30 on Amazon). See Figure 12 for a picture of a
complete low-cost setup, which does not involve any custom
components or additional software beyond wires cut to length.
We have experimentally veriﬁed successful command injec-
tion using this setup into a Google Home located at a distance
of 15 meters, with the main range limitation being the laser

focusing optics and an artiﬁcially-limited power budget of 5
mW for safety reasons. Finally, we achieved a range of 110
meters with the cheap setup by replacing the laser optics with
the telephoto lens from the previous sections.
6.7 Attacking Non-MEMS Microphones
Although smart speakers, phones, and tablets typically use
MEMS microphones due to their small footprint, we also in-
vestigate the feasibility of the attack on larger, conventional
