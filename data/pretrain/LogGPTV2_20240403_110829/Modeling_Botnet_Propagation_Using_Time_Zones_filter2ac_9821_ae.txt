one diurnal phase (i.e., than 24 hours).
A signi(cid:2)cant early work on botnets is [CJ05], which
notes the centralized control structures used for data col-
lection in Section 2. We agree with [CJ05] centralized bot-
net C&C is not always guaranteed, and more research is
needed. Our model tracks propagation, and is orthogonal to
this view.
Bots are often special purpose worms, and so our work
relies on much of the existing worm literature. The utility
of our model assumes administrators can detect and analyze
worms in a somewhat automated fashion to derive the scan-
ning rate and identify the target vulnerability. We have not
discussed this in detail, because tools like honeyd [Pro03]
and others [YBP05, DQG+04] have convincingly demon-
strated the required detection capability.
Biological models of epidemics have of course noted the
importance of dormancy in propagation [DH00]. This cor-
responds to the diurnal factors in our model, which models
night-time as a form of limited natural quarantine or dor-
mancy in the malware. Similarly, biological models have
noted the importance of spatial dispersion, demography,
and other other categorical factors in propagation [DG99].
To a limited extent, this corresponds to the role played by
zones (geographic location) in our time zone model. Com-
puter models of malware, and our model in particular, are
different from these approaches, since contact is not re-
stricted in a computer network, and transmission may occur
between any peers on the Internet.
5 Conclusion
Botnets will continue to grow and evolve, and the re-
search community needs to keep pace. Time zones play an
important role in botnet growth dynamics, and factors such
as time-of-release are important to short-term spread rates.
The data we observed in our sinkhole revealed the im-
portance of time zones and time of day, and motivated the
creation of a diurnal model. The model was more accurate
than the basic SIR models currently used, and accurately
predicted botnet population growth. Further, knowledge of
the diurnal shaping functions lets one identify release times
that maximize malware. This allows one to compare two
given botnets, and priority rank them based on short-term
propagation potential. Since deriving the diurnal shaping
function ((cid:11)(t)) for each time zone requires extensive data
collection, botmasters are unlikely to accurately predict op-
timal release times.
5.1 Future Work
Our future work will also extend the diurnal model to
address email spreading viruses. By studying the rate of
propagation and new victim recruitment observed in sink-
hole studies, we hope to derive a more accurate model of
email virus propagation. We will also identify new tech-
niques to sample botnet populations, so that we can further
study botnets that do not use centralize C&C systems.
Our work so far has identi(cid:2)ed time zone and time of re-
lease as two key factors in short-term virus propagation. We
plan to investigate other possible variables, such as the mix
of operating systems, hot patch levels, and the mix of appli-
cations used on infected systems.
