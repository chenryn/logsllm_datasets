**Describe the feature** :
We would like to be able to link slow queries back to the user or application
which caused the slow query.
Therefore we recommend adding a "logData" parameter to the search API which is
simply copied from the request directly into the slow query log. We can then
put identifiers (user ID, application ID, query ID, etc.) and what-not into
this field to provide the linkages necessary to perform traceback to the
application / systems which caused the slow query.
We realize that we could possibly do this with the "stats" parameter (stats
groups), but we are concerned that there may be many IDs (thousands, millions)
and that the stats-groups structure may not support such a large number of
groups (i.e. it would likely use up memory maintaining stats for millions of
entries).
Thank you.
