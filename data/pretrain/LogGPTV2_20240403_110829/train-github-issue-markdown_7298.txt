## Steps to Reproduce
Seemingly out of nowhere, my app started crashing on startup. Initially I
thought it might be due to recent changes, so I backed out to a prior build
that I knew to be working. That also failed. So I tried with a brand new
project:
  1. `flutter create repro`
  2. `cd repro`
  3. `flutter run`
_That also fails_.
Note that the same app built via `flutter build apk` does work when I deploy
it to my device.
I've tried:
  * `flutter clean`
  * restarting my machine
  * plugging/unplugging my device
None of these things worked, but switching channels to alpha did. So I assume
this has to do with the fact that I upgraded flutter earlier this morning and
master is currently broken? Super weird that it didn't trigger any problem for
_hours_ after the upgrade.
