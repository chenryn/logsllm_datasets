## Steps to Reproduce

My application has started crashing on startup, seemingly without any apparent cause. Initially, I suspected that the issue might be related to recent changes in the code. To test this, I reverted to a previous build that I knew was working, but the problem persisted. I then created a new project to isolate the issue:

1. `flutter create repro`
2. `cd repro`
3. `flutter run`

Unfortunately, the new project also failed to launch. It's worth noting that building the same app using `flutter build apk` and deploying it to my device works without any issues.

I have attempted the following troubleshooting steps, but none of them resolved the problem:
- `flutter clean`
- Restarting my machine
- Disconnecting and reconnecting my device

Interestingly, switching to the alpha channel did resolve the issue. This leads me to believe that the problem is related to a recent Flutter upgrade, as I updated Flutter earlier today. It is particularly odd that the issue did not manifest for several hours after the upgrade.
