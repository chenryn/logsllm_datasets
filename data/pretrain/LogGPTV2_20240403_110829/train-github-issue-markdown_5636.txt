# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
When moving a window out of a fancy zone it should resize to it's original
size before being snapped into the fancy zone. This would operate like the
existing Windows snap feature.
# Proposed technical implementation details
Perhaps add this as an option as the current implementation may be preferred
by some.
