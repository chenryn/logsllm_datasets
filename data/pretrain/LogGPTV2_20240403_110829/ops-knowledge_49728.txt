User: How to use Docker and Kubernetes technology to build microservice architecture? Consider service discovery, load balancing, container orchestration, and more.
Assistant: Using Docker and Kubernetes technology to build a microservice architecture can be achieved through the following steps: 1. Define microservices Define microservice modules, and each module has a container. Every microservice needs to be implemented in a Docker container. 2. Build a Docker image Dockerfile is a script to build a Docker image, which contains the software packages and system configurations that need to be installed. 3. Create a Pod in Kubernetes Using the kubectl command line tool of Kubernetes, you can create a Pod and deploy the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster. A Pod is a logical host of one or more containers that can be managed and monitored by Kubernetes. 4. Add service Discovery The Service object of Kubernetes can expose the network endpoints of Pods and register them in the cluster DNS, so that microservices can access other services by name. 5. Add load balancing The Service object of Kubernetes can distribute requests to multiple Pod instances by setting the load balancing policy. 6. Container orchestration The Deployment object of Kubernetes can automatically create, update, and delete Pod instances, and ensure the stability and correctness of the Pod state according to the container image update strategy. 7. Monitoring and log collection Using Kubernetes' integrated Prometheus monitoring and EFK log collection, comprehensive monitoring and recording of deployed microservices can be achieved.
