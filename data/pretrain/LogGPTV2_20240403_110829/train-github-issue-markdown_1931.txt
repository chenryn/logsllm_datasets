 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
I am not sure,maybe it's just a question.
**What is the current behavior?**  
I fork the lasted master branch of react,and execute `npm run build` at the
root directory.But get some errors below:
    D:\WebStorm_workspace\react>npm run build
    > PI:EMAIL build D:\WebStorm_workspace\react
    > npm run version-check && node scripts/rollup/build.js
    > PI:EMAIL build D:\WebStorm_workspace\react
    > npm run version-check && node scripts/rollup/build.js
    > PI:EMAIL version-check D:\WebStorm_workspace\react
    > node ./scripts/tasks/version-check.js

    npm ERR! If you do, this is most likely a problem with the react-build package,
    npm ERR! not with npm itself.

    npm ERR! You can get information on how to open an issue for this project with:

    npm ERR! Or if that isn't available, you can get their info via:

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and

**What is the expected behavior?**  
Build successfully.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**

of React,this is my first build
