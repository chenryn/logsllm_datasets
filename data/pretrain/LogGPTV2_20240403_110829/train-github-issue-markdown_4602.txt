### TypeScript Version:
1.8.10

### Code
```typescript
function f(a: { b?: string; c?: number; }) {
    // some other logic
}

f({ b: "" }); // No error, as expected
f({ b: 1 }); // Error, as expected
f(1);        // Expected: Error, Actual: No error
f("");       // Expected: Error, Actual: No error
```

### Expected Behavior
- `f({ b: "" })` should not produce an error, as the value of `b` is a valid string.
- `f({ b: 1 })` should produce an error, as the value of `b` is not a string.
- `f(1)` should produce an error, as the argument is not an object that matches the type `{ b?: string; c?: number; }`.
- `f("")` should produce an error, as the argument is not an object that matches the type `{ b?: string; c?: number; }`.

### Actual Behavior
- `f({ b: "" })` does not produce an error, as expected.
- `f({ b: 1 })` produces an error, as expected.
- `f(1)` does not produce an error, which is unexpected.
- `f("")` does not produce an error, which is unexpected.
