When launching Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on a system using Wayland (tested with GNOME 3 and Sway), the following issues were encountered:

1. **Error Messages:**
   ```
   ~$ visual-studio-code
   bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
   bash: no job control in this shell
   Xlib:  extension "XFree86-VidModeExtension" missing on display ":0".
   ```

2. **Screenshots:**

These errors and screenshots indicate that there are compatibility issues when running VS Code under the Wayland display server, particularly with job control and the Xlib extension.
