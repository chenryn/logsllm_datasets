User: I would like to ask about some sources for developing applications with Python and Google App Engine.
For example, some controls to generate automatically pages with the insert/update/delete of a database table, or any other useful resources are welcome.
Thank you!
Assistant: The google app engine "Getting Started" tutorial is very good. The django documentation is also really detailed. 
Take a look at GoogleIO on youtube and watch some of the tutorials.
