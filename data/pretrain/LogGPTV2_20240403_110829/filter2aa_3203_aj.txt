Because the first 16 bits of the starting address are fixed at 10000011 01101011 (131 107 in decimal), 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 59 
all addresses in the range have 131 as the first octet and 107 as the second octet. With 16 variable bits 
in the last two octets, there is a total of 216 or 65,536 possible addresses. 
To specify an address prefix using prefix length notation, you create the starting address by setting all 
variable bits to 0, you convert the address to dotted decimal notation, and then you add a slash and the 
number of fixed bits (the prefix length) after the starting address. 
The IPv4 address prefix 131.107.0.0/16 has 16 fixed bits (10000011 01101011). The starting address is 
the first 16 bits that are fixed and then the last 16 bits that are set to 0, which is 10000011 01101011 
00000000 00000000 or 131.107.0.0. Next, you would add a slash and specify the number of fixed bits 
(/16) to express the address prefix as 131.107.0.0/16. 
Prefix length notation is also known as Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. 
Dotted Decimal Notation 
You can also express an IPv4 address prefix length as a 32-bit number in dotted decimal notation. To 
use this method, set all fixed bits to 1, set all variable bits to 0, and convert the result to dotted decimal 
notation. Continuing our previous example, set the 16 fixed bits to 1 and the 16 variable bits to 0. The 
result is 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000, or 255.255.0.0. The address prefix is expressed as 
131.107.0.0, 255.255.0.0. Expressing the prefix length as a dotted decimal number in this way is also 
known as network mask or subnet mask notation. 
Table 3-1 lists the decimal value of an octet when you set the successive high-order bits of an 8-bit 
number to 1.

Table 3-1  Decimal Values for Prefix Lengths 
When you configure IPv4 address prefixes in Windows, you will use subnet mask notation more 
commonly than prefix length notation. However, you must be familiar with both types of notation 
because some Windows configuration dialog boxes require you to use prefix length notation rather than 
subnet mask notation and because IPv6 supports prefix length notation only. 
Types of IPv4 Addresses 
Internet standards define the following types of IPv4 addresses: 
Unicast  
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 60 
Assigned to a single network interface located on a specific subnet; used for one-to-one 
communication. 
Multicast  
Assigned to one or more network interfaces located on various subnets; used for one-to-many 
communication. 
Broadcast  
Assigned to all network interfaces located on a subnet; used for one-to-everyone on a subnet 
communication. 
The following sections describe these types of addresses in detail. 
IPv4 Unicast Addresses 
The IPv4 unicast address identifies an interface’s location on the network in the same way that a street 
address identifies a house on a city block. Just as a street address must identify a unique residence, an 
IPv4 unicast address must be globally unique and have a uniform format. 
Each IPv4 unicast address includes a subnet prefix and a host ID portion. 
The subnet prefix (also known as a network identifier or network address) portion of an IPv4 unicast 
address identifies the set of interfaces that are located on the same physical or logical network 
segment, whose boundaries are defined by IPv4 routers. A network segment on TCP/IP networks is 
also known as a subnet or a link. All nodes on the same physical or logical subnet must use the same 
subnet prefix, and the subnet prefix must be unique within the entire TCP/IP network. 
The host ID (also known as a host address) portion of an IPv4 unicast address identifies a network 
node's interface on a subnet. The host ID must be unique within the network segment. 
Figure 3-3 illustrates the structure of an example unicast IPv4 address. 
Figure 3-3  Structure of an example unicast IPv4 address 
If the subnet prefix is unique to the TCP/IP network and the host ID is unique on the network segment, 
the entire IPv4 unicast address is unique to the entire TCP/IP network. 
Internet Address Classes 
The Internet community originally defined address classes to systematically assign address prefixes to 
networks of varying sizes. The class of address defined how many bits were used for the subnet prefix 
and how many bits were used for the host ID. Address classes also defined the possible number of 
networks and the number of hosts per network. Of five address classes, class A, B, and C addresses 
were reserved for IPv4 unicast addresses. Class D addresses were reserved for IPv4 multicast 
addresses, and class E addresses were reserved for experimental uses. 
Class A address prefixes were assigned to networks with very large numbers of hosts. The prefix length 
of Class A address prefixes is only 8 bits, allowing the remaining 24 bits to identify up to 16,777,214 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 61 
host IDs. However, the short prefix length limits the number of networks that can receive class A 
address prefixes to 126. First, the high-order bit in class A address prefixes is always set to 0. That 
convention decreases the number of class A address prefixes from 256 to 128. Second, addresses in 
which the first eight bits are set to 00000000 cannot be assigned because they constitute a reserved 
address prefix. Third, addresses in which the first eight bits are set to 01111111 (127 in decimal) cannot 
be assigned because they are reserved for loopback addresses. Those last two conventions decrease 
the number of class A address prefixes from 128 to 126.  
For any IPv4 address prefix, the two host IDs in which all the host bits are set to 0 (the all-zeros host 
ID) or to 1 (the all-ones host ID) are reserved and cannot be assigned to network node interfaces. This 
convention reduces the number of host IDs in each class A network from 16,777,216 (224) to 
16,777,214. 
Figure 3-4 illustrates the structure of class A addresses. 
Figure 3-4  Structure of class A addresses 
Class B address prefixes were assigned to medium to large-sized networks. In addresses for these 
networks, the first 16 bits specify a particular network, and the last 16 bits specify a particular host. 
However, the two high-order bits in a class B address are always set to 10, which makes the address 
prefix for all class B networks and addresses 128.0.0.0/2 (or 128.0.0.0, 192.0.0.0). With 14 bits to 
express class B address prefixes and 16 bits to express host IDs, class B addresses can be assigned 
to 16,384 networks with up to 65,534 hosts per network. 
Figure 3-5 illustrates the structure of class B addresses. 
Figure 3-5  Structure of class B addresses 
Class C address prefixes were assigned to small networks. In addresses for these networks, the first 24 
bits specify a particular network, and the last 8 bits specify particular hosts. However, the three high-
order bits in a class C address prefix are always set to 110, which makes the address prefix for all class 
C networks and addresses 192.0.0.0/3 (or 192.0.0.0, 224.0.0.0). With 21 bits to express class C 
address prefixes and 8 bits to express host IDs, class C addresses can be assigned to 2,097,152 
networks with up to 254 hosts per network.  
Figure 3-6 illustrates the structure of class C addresses. 
Figure 3-6  Structure of class C addresses 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 62 
Class D addresses are reserved for IPv4 multicast addresses. The four high-order bits in a class D 
address are always set to 1110, which makes the address prefix for all class D addresses 224.0.0.0/4 
(or 224.0.0.0, 240.0.0.0). For more information, see "IPv4 Multicast Addresses" in this chapter. 
Class E addresses are reserved for experimental use. The high-order bits in a class E address are set 
to 1111, which makes the address prefix for all class E addresses 240.0.0.0/4 (or 240.0.0.0, 240.0.0.0).

addresses.

Table 3-2  Internet Address Class Summary 
Modern Internet Addresses 
The Internet address classes are an obsolete method of allocating unicast addresses because it proved 
inefficient. For example, a large organization with a class A address prefix can have up to 16,777,214 
hosts. However, if the organization uses only 70,000 host IDs, 16,707,214 potential IPv4 unicast 
addresses for the Internet are wasted.  
Since 1993, IPv4 address prefixes are assigned to organizations based on the organization's actual 
need for Internet-accessible IPv4 unicast addresses. This method is known as Classless Inter-Domain 
Routing (CIDR). For example, an organization determines that it needs 2,000 Internet-accessible IPv4 
unicast addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or an Internet 
service provider (ISP) allocates an IPv4 address prefix in which 21 bits are fixed, leaving 11 bits for host 
IDs. From the 11 bits for host IDs, you can create 2,046 possible IPv4 unicast addresses. 
CIDR-based address allocations typically start at 24 bits for the address prefix and 8 bits for the host ID. 
Table 3-3 lists the required number of host IDs and the corresponding prefix length for CIDR-based 
address allocations.

Table 3-3  Host ID Requirements and CIDR-based Prefix Lengths  
Public Addresses 
If you want direct (routed) connectivity to the Internet, then you must use public addresses. If you want 
indirect (proxied or translated) connectivity to the Internet, you can use either public or private 
addresses. If your intranet is not connected to the Internet in any way, you can use any unicast IPv4 
addresses that you want. However, you should use private addresses to avoid network renumbering if 
your intranet ever directly connects to the Internet. 
ICANN assigns public addresses, which consist of either historically allocated classful address prefixes 
or, more recently, CIDR-based address prefixes that are guaranteed to be unique on the Internet. For 
CIDR-based address prefixes, the value of w (the first octet) ranges from 1 to 126 and from 128 to 223, 
with the exception of the private address prefixes described in the "Private Addresses" section of this 
chapter. 
When ICANN assigns a public address prefix to an organization, routes are added to the routers of the 
Internet so that traffic matching the address prefix can reach the organization. For example, when an 
organization is assigned an address prefix, that address prefix also exists as a route in the routers of 
the Internet. IPv4 packets that are sent to an address within the assigned address prefix are routed to 
the proper destination. 
Illegal Addresses 
Private organization intranets that do not need an Internet connection can choose any address scheme 
they want, even using public address prefixes that ICANN has assigned to other networks. If the private 
organization later decides to directly connect to the Internet, these addresses could conflict with existing 
public addresses and become illegal addresses. Organizations with illegal addresses cannot receive 
traffic at those addresses because the routers of the Internet send traffic destined to ICANN-allocated 
address prefixes to the assigned organizations, not to the organizations using illegal addresses. 
For example, a private organization chooses to use the 206.73.118.0/24 address prefix for its intranet. 
ICANN has assigned that prefix to the Microsoft Corporation, and routes exist on the Internet routers to 
send all packets for IPv4 addresses on 206.73.118.0/24 to Microsoft. As long as the private 
organization does not connect to the Internet, it has no problem because the two address prefixes are 
on separate IPv4 networks; therefore, the addresses are unique to each network. If the private 
organization later connects directly to the Internet and continues to use the 206.73.118.0/24 address 
prefix, any traffic sent through the Internet to those addresses will arrive at Microsoft, not the private 
organization. 
Private Addresses 
Each IPv4 interface requires an IPv4 address that is unique within the IPv4 network. In the case of the 
Internet, each IPv4 interface on a subnet connected to the Internet requires an IPv4 address that is 
unique within the Internet. As the Internet grew, organizations connecting to it required a public address 
for each interface on their intranets. This requirement placed a huge demand on the pool of available 
public addresses. 
When analyzing the addressing needs of organizations, the designers of the Internet noted that, for 
many organizations, most of the hosts did not require direct connectivity to the Internet. Those hosts 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 64 
that did require a specific set of Internet services, such as Web access and e-mail, typically accessed 
the Internet services through Application layer gateways, such as proxy servers and e-mail servers. The 
result is that most organizations required only a few public addresses for those nodes (such as proxies, 
servers, routers, firewalls, and translators) that were directly connected to the Internet. 
Hosts within the organization that do not require direct access to the Internet required IPv4 addresses 
that do not duplicate already-assigned public addresses. To solve this addressing problem, the Internet 
designers reserved a portion of the IPv4 address space for private addresses. IPv4 addresses in the 
private address space are known as private addresses and never assigned as public addresses. 
Because the public and private address spaces do not overlap, private addresses never duplicate 
public addresses. 
RFC 1918 defines the following address prefixes for the private address space: 
10.0.0.0/8  (10.0.0.0, 255.0.0.0) 
Allows the following range of valid IPv4 unicast addresses: 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254. The 
10.0.0.0/8 address prefix has 24 host bits that you can use for any addressing scheme within a 
private organization. 
172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0, 255.240.0.0) 
Allows the following range of valid IPv4 unicast addresses: 172.16.0.1 to 172.31.255.254. The 
172.16.0.0/12 address prefix has 20 host bits that you can use for any addressing scheme within a 
private organization. 
192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0, 255.255.0.0) 
Allows the following range of valid IPv4 unicast addresses: 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.255.254. The 
192.168.0.0/16 address prefix has 16 host bits that you can use for any addressing scheme within a 
private organization.
