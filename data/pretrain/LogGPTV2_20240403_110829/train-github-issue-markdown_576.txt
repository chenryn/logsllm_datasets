Assuming that windows and webviews inherit the nodeintegration setting from
parents, and nodeintegration is disabled, is still possible to run JS with
full node integration via the Preload function.
` `  
Currently seems that the only scheme accepted is file://, despite
documentation saying that also asar:// is supported.
What will be the best way to prevent Preloading files from the network?
asar:// was a local reference only? If so will be good to have that one back.
Otherwise is there a way to implement a filter with event handling in the
main.js to block remote files ?
Is there a way to enable preload in main.js only and disable it in all
renderers?
Will protocol  module work to handle file:// in Preloads?
