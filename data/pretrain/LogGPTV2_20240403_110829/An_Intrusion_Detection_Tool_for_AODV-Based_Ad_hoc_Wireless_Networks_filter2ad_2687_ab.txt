itor network traﬃc within their observable radio
transmission range.
Dynamic topologies make it diﬃcult to obtain a
global view of the network and any approximation
can become quickly outdated. Mobility introduces
additional diﬃculty in setting up a system of nodes
cooperating in an IDS. A node’s movements cannot
be restricted in order to let the IDS cooperate or col-
lect data; neither can a node be expected to monitor
the same physical area for an extended period of
time. A single node may be unable to obtain a large
enough sample size of data to accurately diagnose
other nodes. Fortunately, other nodes also gather
data over time and create their own audit logs.
The loss or capture of unattended sensors and
personal computing devices may allow for a mali-
cious node to obtain legitimate credentials and
launch more serious attacks. A node that sends
out false routing information could be a compro-
mised node, or merely a node that has a temporarily
stale

conditions.

Thus, reliable identiﬁcation is an important
necessity for any MANET IDS, since detected
intrusions must be associated with speciﬁc entities.
Otherwise, attackers can impersonate other legiti-
mate nodes and the utility of the IDS becomes
questionable.

In practice, even a single malicious node can
launch various kinds of attacks against its peers.
582

Attacks can span from single adversary, routing
disruption attacks like man-in-the-middle attacks,
to multiple, colluding adversaries, resource con-
sumption attacks such as denial-of-service attacks.
Therefore, MANETs are extremely vulnerable to
attacks due to their dynamically changing topology,
absence of conventional security infrastructures and
open medium of communication, which, unlike
their wired counterparts, cannot be secured. To
address these concerns, several secure routing pro-
tocols have been proposed: SAODV [22], Ariadne
[18], SEAD [23], CSER [24], SRP [25], SAAR [26],
BSAR [27], and SBRP [28].
[22]
SAODV (Secure Ad-hoc On-demand Distance
Vector) protocol
is an extension of AODV
[13] that assumes the existence of a certiﬁed public
key for each node. To protect routing messages
against forgeries, all
intermediate nodes crypto-
graphically validate the digital signature appended
to the routing message.
The Ariadne [18] protocol secures DSR by
authenticating the sender of the message. It requires
either a shared key among paired peers, a system-
wide distributed public key for each node or a
TESLA (Time-Eﬃcient
Stream Loss-tolerant
Authentication) key for each node.
AODV and DSR are similar in most aspects of
route discovery and maintenance, however diﬀer in
the way packets are routed. In AODV routing
entries are maintained by nodes along the route
from source to destination, whereas in DSR source
routing is used, i.e. the routed packets contain the
address of each device that the packet will traverse.
It is noteworthy to mention two similar secure rout-
ing protocols based on DSR that have been pro-
posed in literature viz., BSAR [27] and SBRP [28].
SBRP additionally requires using DNS servers to
simplify network conﬁguration. SecAODV, BSAR,
and SBRP all use the IPv6 address auto-conﬁgura-
tion feature and sign control messages to prevent
tampering. Signed evidence is produced by the orig-
inator of the message and signature veriﬁcation is
performed by the destination, without any form of
delegation of trust.
While BSAR has been simulated in ns-2, SBRP
has no known simulation. Neither BSAR nor SBRP
have any known implementations. SecAODV is
based on AODV and routing decisions are made
on a hop-by-hop basis. Consequently the IDS
designed to monitor traﬃc does not assume knowl-
edge of next hop of packets, unlike in the case of
watchdogs for DSR.
Security features of SecAODV are based on the
use of Statistically Unique and Cryptographically
Veriﬁable (SUCV) identiﬁers proposed by Montene-
gro and Castellucia [6]. Each device produces its
own Public and Private Key pair, and generates a
statistically unique address by computing a secure
hash over its own Public Key. Other nodes can ver-
ify the binding (ownership) of that cryptographic
address with the corresponding Public Key by
recomputing the same address from the provided
Public Key of the node. We use SUCVs in the
AODV routing process to protect against address
spooﬁng and other kinds of routing disruption
attacks. However, there is a limitation to the use
of SUCVs – they merely provide a secure binding
between the IPv6 address and the Public Key of
the node. They serve as the unique identiﬁer of a
node in the MANET. However, nothing is really
known about the node using that identity,
i.e.
there is no pre-existing enumeration of
trusted
SUCVs. We describe the implementation in detail
in Section 4.
Various schemes have been proposed in literature
to detect Sybil attacks including position veriﬁca-
tion, resource-consuming challenges, and position
veriﬁcation. Sybil attacks in general are diﬃcult to
detect without an identiﬁcation authority or without
making strong assumptions like resource parity of
all devices [29]. However in speciﬁc kinds of ad
hoc networks like Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
(VANETs) with
like
restricted mobility it is possible to address Sybil
attacks without making such strong assumptions.
For example a combination of GPS location,
SUCV-like identiﬁers, and position veriﬁcation
would be suﬃcient
in
VANETs. Measuring signal strengths or other sim-
ilar distinguishing methods could help improve
detection. These techniques however can be orthog-
onally implemented and incorporated into the intru-
sion detection process [29,30].

We assume that the nodes in the network are

3.2. Intrusion detection
Marti et al. [5] propose a ‘‘watchdog’’ mechanism
that observes misbehaving nodes and a ‘‘pathrater’’
mechanism that helps routing protocols to avoid
such nodes. However, it is also necessary to attri-
bute misbehavior to particular entities for eﬀective

response to intrusions. In our approach, the use of
SUCVs ensures a secure binding between the IPv6
addresses and Public Keys of individual nodes.
Zhang and Lee [17] categorize host-based IDSs
based on anomaly detection and misuse detection.
Anomaly detection-based systems detect intrusions
based on an established baseline of normal behav-
ior. Misuse detection involves identifying attack sig-
natures and usage patterns associated with known
attacks. Also, communication patterns are diﬀerent
from wireline devices and mobile devices are often
expected to operate in disconnected mode. Anoma-
lies are not easily distinguishable from localized,
incomplete, and possibly outdated information.
So, prevalent anomaly detection schemes used in
wired networks are not directly applicable in wire-
less ad hoc networks. Hence, they propose a new
architecture for an IDS, based on IDS agents.
Several
speciﬁcation based IDSs have been
proposed that model the behavior of the routing
protocol using a Finite State Machine (FSM) and
try to classify anomalies – deviations from expected
behavior, as attacks. Tseng et al. [31] describe sev-
eral attacks possible in the base AODV protocol.
They illustrate the use of a ﬁnite state machine to
detect anomalous behavior in order to determine
attacks. They also suggest the use of an additional
previous hop ﬁeld to ascertain the source/path of
AODV control messages.
Speciﬁcation based IDSs model the behavior of
individual nodes by monitoring all the inbound
and outbound, data and control traﬃc, of the
monitored node. These approaches require that
models be built from the protocol speciﬁcations,
to be able to classify intrusions. Also, it is assumed
that the monitored node is continuously observable.
Monitoring the correct routing state of another
node by observing all inbound and outbound traﬃc
is a complex process and will require signiﬁcant
resources. Additionally, practical diﬃculties like
device mobility and/or radio interference are unli-
kely to allow continuous accurate monitoring of
devices, further complicating the task of speciﬁca-
tion based IDSs.
Adversaries may faithfully abide by the Sec-
AODV routing process yet the data traﬃc through

dropped or tampered with. It is necessary to detect
such nodes that are chronically faulty or malicious.
To protect against such attacks, we propose a

establishment),
SecAODV is a highly adaptive distributed algo-
rithm designed for IPv6-based MANETs that does
not require: (1) prior trust relations between pairs
of nodes (e.g., a trusted third party or a distributed
trust
synchronization
between nodes, or (3) prior shared keys or any other
form of secure association. The protocol provides
on-demand trust establishment among the nodes
collaborating to detect malicious activities. A trust
relationship is established based on a dynamic eval-
uation of the sender’s ‘‘secure IP’’ and signed evi-
dence, contained in the SecAODV header. This
routing protocol enables the source and destination
nodes to establish a secure communication channel
based on the concept of Statistically Unique and
identiﬁers
Cryptographically Veriﬁable
[6,27] which ensure a secure binding between IP
addresses and keys, without requiring any trusted
CA or KDC. The concept of SUCV is similar to
that of Cryptographically Generated Address
(CGAs) [32]. SUCVs associate a host’s IPv6 address
with its public key that provides veriﬁable proof of
ownership of that IPv6 address to other nodes.
(SUCV)
IPv6 was adopted for its large address space,
portability and suitability in generating SUCVs.
The address auto-conﬁguration feature available in
IPv6 that allows IP auto-conﬁguration for the nodes
on a need basis, is of special importance.
4.2. Working of SecAODV
The AODV protocol [13] is comprised of two
basic mechanisms, viz., route discovery and mainte-
nance of local connectivity. The SecAODV protocol
adds security features to the basic AODV mecha-
nisms of route discovery, setup, and maintenance.
The route caching feature of AODV is however
disabled for ensuring end-to-end veriﬁcation (see
4.2.2).
Hu and Johnson [33] have shown that route cach-
ing provides signiﬁcant performance beneﬁts in
terms of control message overhead (fewer RREQs
and RREPs sent and received), faster route setups,
etc. Cache timeouts and cache sizes also play a
584
A. Patwardhan et al. / Ad Hoc Networks 6 (2008) 578–599
signiﬁcant role in improving the performance. Per-
formance has also been shown to deteriorate drasti-
cally beyond certain cache timeouts. Providing
strong security and high performance simulta-
neously has proven to be diﬃcult, since optimiza-
tion techniques like gratuitous RREP from known
cached routes have to be disabled, since prior secu-
rity associations with such intermediate nodes can-
not be assumed.
4.2.1. Secure address auto-conﬁguration and
veriﬁcation
To join a MANET, a node executes a script that
sets its Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID), then proceeds
to install and conﬁgure all IPv6 and SecAODV
related kernel modules, and ﬁnally starts the aodvd
daemon. The daemon obtains its site and global
subnet identiﬁers, and runtime parameters from a
conﬁguration ﬁle and/or from the command line.
The aodvd daemon then generates a 1024-bit
RSA key pair. Using the public key of this pair,
the securely bound global and site-local
IPv6
addresses are generated. To derive the addresses, a
node generates a 64-bit pseudo-random value by
applying a one-way, collision-resistant hash func-
tion to the newly generated, uncertiﬁed, RSA public
key. However, only 62 bits out of the generated 64
bits are then used for the IPv6 address because 2 bits
of the address space are reserved. The ﬁnal IPv6
address is generated by concatenating the subnet
identiﬁer with the pseudo-random value derived
from the public key and by setting the two reserved
bits, according to RFC 3513 (2373) [34]. A source
node uses the secure binding to authenticate its
IPv6 address to an arbitrary destination. Upon
completion of the RSA keys generation and IP
address conﬁguration, SecAODV can optionally
broadcast Hello-type, signed messages to its neigh-
bors to make its presence known.
The basic idea behind the secure binding between
IPv6 addresses and the RSA keys is to use the 62 out
of the 64 low order bits of the IPv6 address, which
represent the host ID, to store a cryptographic hash
of the public key assigned or generated by the
device. The two bits of the interface identiﬁer that
are not set using the hash of the public key are: (i)
bit 6 which is deﬁned as the universal/local
bit, and (ii) bit 7 which is deﬁned as the individ-
ual/group bit. The bits numbering starts with 0 at
the leftmost bit of the interface identiﬁer [34]. The
relayed message is then signed and the public key
is then attached to it. The structure of the Sec-
AODV message is presented in Fig. 1 and discussed
in detailed below.
The SecAODV implementation follows Tuomi-
nen’s design [35] which uses two kernel modules
ip6_queue, ip6_nf_aodv, and a userspace
daemon aodvd.
4.2.2. Secure route discovery and maintenance
A Hello message contains the node’s sequence
number, the lifetime, and the node’s IP address.
The RSA public keys (modulus and exponent) are
base-64 encoded in a tag-length-value format.
A source node must sign its sent packets with its
private key and attach its public key to it for signa-
ture and IP address veriﬁcation in order to further
authenticate the contents of its packets to an arbi-
trary destination node.
A source node S that requests communication
with another member of the MANET referred to
as destination D – initiates the process by construct-
ing and broadcasting a signed route request message
RREQ. The format of the SecAODV RREQ message
diﬀers from the one proposed in [13], it additionally
contains the RSA public key of the source node S
and is digitally signed to ensure authenticity and
integrity of the message (refer to Fig. 1). Upon
receiving a RREQ message, each node authenticates
the source S, by verifying the message integrity,
