##### Detailed description
OpenCV iOS framework built with Xcode12.1 **(swift5.3)** is not working on
Xcode12.2 **(swift5.3.1)**  
Error message is below.
    Failed to build module 'OpenCV' from its module interface; the compiler that produced it, 'Apple Swift version 5.3 (swiftlang-1200.0.29.2 clang-1200.0.30.1)', may have used features that aren't supported by this compiler, 'Apple Swift version 5.3.1 (swiftlang-1200.0.41 clang-1200.0.32.8)'
I think this PR was supposed to deal with this problem.
##### Steps to reproduce
  1. Build opencv framework with Xcode12.1
  2. Use the built framework in with Xcode12.2
