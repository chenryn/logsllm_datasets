APPENDIX: MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK
We implement an extensible and reusable measurement frame-
work to facilitate future transactions analysis related research.
Our framework currently supports the three blockchains ana-
lyzed in this work, Tezos, EOSIO and XRPL but can easily
be extended to support other blockchains. The core of the
software is implemented in Go and is designed to work well on
a single machine with many cores. The framework frontend
is provided as a cross-platform static binary command line
tool.
While the framework is responsible for the heavy lifting and
processing the gigabytes of data, we also provide a companion
tool implemented in Python to generate plots and tables from
the data generated by the framework.
Data fetching. The framework currently allows to fetch data
either using RPC over HTTP or websockets. Tezos and EO-
SIO both use the HTTP adapter to retrieve data while XRPL
uses the websocket interface. The data is retrieved from pub-
licly available archive nodes but the framework can be con-
figured to use other nodes if necessary. The retrieved data
is stored in a gzipped JSON Lines format where each line
corresponds to a block. Blocks are stored in chunk of 𝑛 blocks
per file — where 𝑛 can be configured — making parallel pro-
cessing straightforward. It took less than two days to fetch
all the data presented in Figure 2.

Figure 11: Configuration file for our measurement framework
Data processing. The framework provides several processors
which can mainly be used to aggregate the data either over
IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
time, or over certain properties such as the sender of a trans-
action. The framework is configured using a single JSON file,
containing the configuration for the data to be processed as
well as the specification of what type of statistics should be
collected from the dataset. We show a sample configuration
file in Figure 11. This configuration computes three statistics
from block 82,152,667 to block 118,286,375, using the data
contained in all the files matching /data/eos_blocks-*.jsonl.gz.
The framework will compute the total number of transactions,
the number of actions grouped using their receiver over a
period of 6 hours, and finally the total number of actions
grouped by their name. All the statistics described above
can be used for all the blockchains but the framework also
supports blockchain-specific statistics where needed. New sta-
tistics can easily be added to the framework by implementing
a common interface.
Our framework was able to analyze the data and output
all the statistics required for this paper in less than 4 hours
using a powerful 48 core machine.

Figure 12: Main interfaces of our measurement framework
Extending to other blockchains. The framework has been
made as generic as possible to allow integrating other
blockchains to perform similar kind of analysis. In particular,
the framework contains three main interfaces shown in Fig-
ure 12. The FetchData method can be implemented by reusing
the HTTP or websocket adapters provided by the framework
while the Block and Action interfaces typically involves defining
the schema of the block or action of the blockchain imple-
mented. In our implementation, adding a blockchain takes
on average 105 new lines of Go code not including tests.
