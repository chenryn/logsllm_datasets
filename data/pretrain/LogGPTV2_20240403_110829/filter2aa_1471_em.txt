booting, whereas UseErrorControl causes the

specified in its service key.

Causes the HAL to stop at a breakpoint early in 
HAL initialization. The first thing the Windows 
kernel does when it initializes is to initialize the 
HAL, so this breakpoint is the earliest one 
possible (unless boot debugging is used). If the 
switch is used without the /DEBUG switch, the 
system will present a blue screen with a STOP 
code of 0x00000078 (PHASE0_ EXCEPTION).

Default allows the boot loader to determine 
whether the system supports PAE and loads the 
PAE kernel. ForceEnable forces this behavior, 
while ForceDisable forces the loader to load the 
non-PAE version of the Windows kernel, even if 
the system is detected as supporting x86 PAEs 
and has more than 4 GB of physical memory. 
However, non-PAE x86 kernels are not 
supported anymore in Windows 10.

Instructs Windows not to initialize the VGA
