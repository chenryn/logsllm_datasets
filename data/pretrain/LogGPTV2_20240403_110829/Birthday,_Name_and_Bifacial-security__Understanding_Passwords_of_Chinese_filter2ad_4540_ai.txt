ple, ‘t’ is common in English texts, but not so common
in English passwords. A plausible reason may be that ‘t’
is used in popular words like the, it, this, that, at,
to, while such words are rare in passwords.
To further explore the closeness of passwords with
their native languages and with the passwords from other
datasets, we measure the inversion number of the letter
distribution sequences (in descending order) between
two password datasets (as well as languages). The results
are summarized in Table 2.
“Pinyin fullname” is a
dictionary consisting of 2,426,841 unique Chinese full
names (e.g., wanglei and zhangwei), “Pinyin word” is
a dictionary consisting of 127,878 unique Chinese words
(e.g., chang and cheng), and these two dictionaries are
detailed in Appendix B. Note that the inversion number
of sequence A to sequence B is equal to that of B to A.
For instance, the inversion number of inauh to aniuh is
3, which is equal to that of aniuh to inauh.
As shown in Table 2, the inversion number of letter
distributions between passwords from the same language
group is generally much smaller than that of passwords
from different language groups. This value is also
distinctly smaller than that of the letter distributions
between passwords and their native language (see the
bold values in Table 2). The latter is less expected. All
this indicates that passwords from different languages are
intrinsically different from each other in letter distribu-
tions, and that passwords are close to their native lan-
guage yet the distinction is still signiﬁcant (measurable).
