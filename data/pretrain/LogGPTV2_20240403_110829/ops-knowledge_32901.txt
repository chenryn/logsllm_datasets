User: I have python 2.6.6 and python 3.1.3 currently installed on my machine (Windows Vista 64 bit)
My path variable includes the directory of both versions. How can I specify which python I want to run a program in. For instance, if I want to run a program in python 3, it works but if I want to run a different program in python2 I get a syntax error. So how can I run a python 2 program in the cmd?
Typing python in my command line, python 3.1.3 is the only one that shows up.
Assistant: You can specify the version in the executable name python2.6 and python3.
