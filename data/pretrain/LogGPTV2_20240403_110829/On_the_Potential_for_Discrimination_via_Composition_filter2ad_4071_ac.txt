## Appendix: Supporting Results

In this appendix, we present additional results that support the findings in the main paper.

### Figure 4: Distributions of Representation Ratios for Different Sets of Targetings and Different Ad Platforms, Across Multiple Age Ranges

**Skew Across Age Ranges:**
While the main body of the paper presented results for skew relative to the youngest users (ages 18-24), Figure 4 shows the corresponding results for older users (ages 25-34, 35-54, and 55+).

**Observations:**
- Across ad platforms, even individual targeting attributes are highly skewed.
- This skew is moderately exacerbated for randomly chosen pairs of targeting attributes and even more so for the most skewed pairs.
- We can effectively exclude older users (e.g., LinkedIn users aged 55+) via targeting compositions.

### Figure 5: Distributions of Recalls of a Particular Protected Class for Different Sets of Skewed Targetings (Exceeding the Four-Fifths Threshold) Skewed Toward That Protected Class

**Recall of Sensitive Populations:**
We complement our discussion in Section 4.3 by presenting results for males and various age ranges, in addition to females.

**Observations:**
- The median recall of pairs of targeting attributes is substantial but lower than the median recall of individual attributes.
- The median recall of skewed targetings excluding particular age ranges is generally higher than the median recall of skewed targetings including the same age ranges.

### Table 1: Exploring the Potential for Increased Recall of a Target Sensitive Population by Targeting Ads Across Multiple Skewed Audiences

**Potential for Increased Recall:**
- We explore the potential for increased recall by presenting the median overlap between pairs of the top 100 skewed targeting compositions.
- The overlaps are small, with the largest median overlap being just 22.58% (for female-skewed compositions on Facebook's restricted interface).
- Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we estimate the total recall obtained by combining the top 10 most skewed targeting compositions.

**Results:**
- Total recall of over a million in most cases, e.g., using the top 10 most skewed compositions, an advertiser on LinkedIn can achieve a total recall of over 5 million when excluding younger users (ages 18-24) and over a million when excluding older users (ages 55+).

### Figure 6: Effect of Removal of the Most Skewed Individual Targetings on the Skew of Pairwise Targeting Compositions, for Different Ages

**Removing Skewed Individual Targetings:**
- We extend the discussion in Section 4.3 to include various age ranges.
- Even the removal of the top 10 percentile most skewed individual attributes is insufficient to mitigate skew in the resulting targeting compositions.
- In some cases, the 90th percentile representation ratio for pairwise compositions reduces to within the bounds of the four-fifths rule, but higher degrees of targeting compositions could still enable highly skewed ad targeting.

### Ad Platform and Favoured Gender

| Ad Platform | Favoured Gender | Targeting 1 (T1) | Targeting 2 (T2) | Rep. Ratio for T1 and T2 |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| FB-restricted | Male | Interests → Mechanical engineering | Interests → Automobile repair shop | 4.68 |
| Facebook | Female | Interests → Buy to let | Interests → Sedan (automobile) | 2.62 |
| Google | Male | Interests → Hatchback | Interests → Computer engineering | 3.25 |
| LinkedIn | Female | Interests → Electrical engineering | Interests → Cars | 3.71 |

This table provides examples of specific targeting combinations and their representation ratios for different ad platforms and favoured genders.
