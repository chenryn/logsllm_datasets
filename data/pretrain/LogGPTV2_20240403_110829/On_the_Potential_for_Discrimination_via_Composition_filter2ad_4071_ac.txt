A SUPPORTING RESULTS
In this Appendix, we present some additional results supporting
those in the paper.
Figure 4: Distributions of representation ratios for different sets of
targetings and different ad platforms, across multiple age ranges.
Skew across age ranges While we presented results for the skew
relative to the youngest users considered (ages 18-24) in Figures 1
and 2 of the main body of the paper, we now present the corre-
sponding results for older users (ages 25-34, 35-54, and 55+) in
Figure 4.
We observe similar results as before across ad platforms: while
even the individual targeting attributes contain highly skewed at-
tributes, this is typically moderately exacerbated even for randomly
chosen pairs of targeting attributes, and even more exacerbated
when the most skewed pairs are considered. As with younger users,
we see that we can effectively exclude older users (for example,
users on LinkedIn aged 55+) via targeting compositions.

Figure 5: Distributions of recalls of a particular protected class for different sets of skewed targetings (exceeding the four-fifths thresholds)
skewed toward that protected class. Results are shown for different ad platforms, and for different genders and ages, with the distribution
across all individual targetings also shown for reference. Also shown is the total size of the given sensitive population for each ad platform.
Recall of sensitive populations We next complement our discus-
sion in Section 4.3 of the recall achieved by both skewed targeting
compositions; while that discussion focused on females, we now
additionally present results for males, as well as for various age
ranges.
As described in the paper, we first plot the distribution of the
recalls of particular genders and ages achieved by various sets of
skewed targetings in Figure 5. For reference, we also show the total
size of the given sensitive population for each ad platform. We see
results similar to those noted in Section 4.3: across genders and
ages, the median recall of pairs of targeting attributes is substantial
(while corresponding only to a niche percentage of the sensitive
population), but considerably lower than the median recall of indi-
vidual attributes. Additionally, we observe that the median recall

of skewed targetings excluding particular age ranges are in most
cases higher than the median recall of skewed targetings including
the same particular age ranges; this is expected as exclusions of
particular age ranges correspond to a wider range of ages (for the
age ranges we study).
Similar to the discussion in Section 4.3, we next study whether
an advertiser can achieve increased recall of a given sensitive pop-
ulation by running ads across multiple skewed compositions, ef-
fectively performing a logical or of the individual audiences. We
first explore the potential for this increased recall by presenting
the median overlap between pairs of the top 100 skewed targeting
compositions (favouring various genders and ages) in the first sec-
tion of Table 1; the overlap for each pair of audiences is measured
as the percentage of the smaller audience that falls in the other
audience. We find that the overlaps are small (often in single digits),
with the largest median overlap (For Facebook’s restricted interface,
corresponding to female-skewed compositions) being just 22.58%;
this indicates the potential, across sensitive populations and ages,
for increased recall across multiple skewed targeting compositions.
Finally, as in Section 4.3, we further quantify this potential for in-
creased recall by using the inclusion-exclusion principle to estimate
the total recall obtained by combining the top 10 most skewed target-
ing compositions (favouring various sensitive populations). While
the coarse granularity of size estimates could affect the result of
adding these estimates as per the inclusion-exclusion principle, we
confirmed that the estimated recalls converged as we successively
added the higher-order terms specified by the inclusion-exclusion
principle. We compare the recall of the most skewed composition,
to the recall achieved by the top 10 compositions together, in the
second section of Table 1. We see a total recall of over a million in
most cases; for example, using the top 10 most skewed composi-
tions, an advertiser on LinkedIn can achieve a total recall of over
5 million when excluding younger users (ages 18-24), and over a
million when excluding older users (ages 55+).
Removing skewed individual targetings We finally extend the
discussion in Section 4.3 on the impact of removing highly skewed
individual targetings on the skew of the resulting targeting compo-
sitions; while that discussion focused on genders, here we present
results for various age ranges. As before, for a given sensitive de-
mographic, we remove the most skewed individual targetings in
steps of 2 percentile, and discover the resulting sets of most skewed
compositions using the greedy method; we plot the corresponding
variation in skew for different age ranges in Figure 6.
We observe that in most cases, the removal of even the top 10 per-
centile most skewed individual attributes is insufficient to mitigate
skew in the resulting targeting compositions. While in some cases
the 90th percentile representation ratio for pairwise compositions
does reduce to within the bounds of the four-fifths rule, such as
for selectively including younger users of ages 18-24 on LinkedIn,
even in these cases, higher degrees of targeting compositions could
potentially again enable highly skewed ad targeting.

responding to skewed targetings). For each sensitive population, the first three columns show the median pairwise intersection size between
the top 100 most skewed targeting audiences toward that population. The remaining columns show the recall achieved by the top skewed tar-
geting audience, and for the estimated (using the inclusion-exclusion rule) total recall for combining the top 10 skewed targeting audiences
respectively. For each case, also shown within brackets is the percentage recall achieved of the target sensitive population on the platform.
