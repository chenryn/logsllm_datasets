User: Ok i have these commands used in batch and i wanted to know the commands in python that would have a similar affect, just to be clear i dont want to just use os.system("command here") for each of them. For example in batch if you wanted a list of commands you would type help but in python you would type help() and then modules... I am not trying to use batch in a python script, i just wanna know the similarities in both languages. Like in english you say " Hello" but in french you say "Bonjour" not mix the two languages. (heres the list of commands/functions id like to know:

change the current directory
clear the screen in the console 
change the prompt to something other than >>>
how to make a loop function
redirections/pipes
start an exteral program (like notepad or paint) from within a script
how to call or import another python script
how to get help with a specific module without having to type help() 

@8: (in batch it would be command /?)
EDITED COMPLETELY
Thanks in Adnvance!
Assistant: Python is not a system shell, Python is a multi-paradigm programming language.
If you want to compare .bat with anything, compare it with sh or bash. (You can have those on various platforms too - for example, sh for windows is in the MinGW package).
