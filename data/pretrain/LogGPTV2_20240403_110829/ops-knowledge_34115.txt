Question: Considering the historical use of the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol in wireless security, which of the following factors contributed to the vulnerability of its encryption scheme?
"A": "The IVs were included in plaintext as part of the packet, making them directly observable to attackers.",
"B": "The WEP protocol supported excessively long IVs, which made encryption keys more vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
"C": "WEP used a key generation algorithm that was inherently flawed, producing weak keys that could be easily cracked.",
"D": "Some implementations would reuse the same IV for each packet, which simplified the process of plaintext recovery."
Answer: AD
