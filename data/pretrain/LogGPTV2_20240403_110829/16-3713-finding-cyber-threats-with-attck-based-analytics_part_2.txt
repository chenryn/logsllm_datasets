### Detection Capabilities for Post-Compromise Threats

Detection capabilities are essential when a threat bypasses established defenses or employs new methods to enter a network. Here are the five key principles for effective threat-based security:

#### Principle 1: Include Post-Compromise Detection
Even the most well-defended networks can be penetrated. For example, there is no entirely effective way to prevent every zero-day vulnerability from being exploited, no method to instantaneously patch software, and no foolproof way to prevent human error such as exposing passwords. The complexity of the attack surface means that Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) will likely continue to find ways to circumvent common security practices. Therefore, any effective network security strategy should account for post-compromise adversary behavior to minimize damage caused by an adversary who successfully penetrates initial defenses.

#### Principle 2: Focus on Behavior
Many contemporary defenses rely on signatures or indicators of compromise (IOCs). However, these are often brittle and easy for adversaries to bypass by modifying malware or infrastructure. Indicators like file hashes, IP addresses, and domain names are trivial for adversaries to change to avoid detection. An intrusion detection program incorporating behavioral detection analytics is more resilient. Behavioral detection approaches help identify common behaviors performed by many adversary groups during an intrusion, independent of specific changes to indicators. This is the premise behind the development of ATT&CK-based analytics.

#### Principle 3: Use a Threat-based Model
A robust security process is built on a comprehensive threat model. The ATT&CK model describes post-compromise adversary behaviors within enterprise networks. It takes the three post-compromise stages of the cyber-attack lifecycle and expands them into 10 distinct tactics used by APTs. This model helps defenders adequately plan and evaluate their defenses.

#### Principle 4: Iterate by Design
An iterative process is critical for creating an effective behavioral analytics and detection system. Testing behavioral analytics every few months against a Red Team that emulates known APT behaviors provides a quick feedback loop. This approach allows analysts to validate performance in a real network environment, quickly identifying which ideas are useful, which need further development, and which should be discarded. Iteration also enables network defenses to adapt to a changing threat landscape, making it harder for adversaries to avoid detection.

#### Principle 5: Develop and Test in a Realistic Environment
Iterative development and testing of analytics and detection capabilities should be performed in a live production environment or one that closely mimics it. MITRE’s Red Team emulated APT behavior based on the latest understanding of current threats within ATT&CK. The actual development and testing were conducted on a 250-node enclave on the MITRE corporate network, with real users performing their normal daily work to ensure realistic background system noise. This approach ensures that the analytics can effectively detect desired adversary behaviors.

### ATT&CK: A Model for Describing Adversary Actions

ATT&CK is a model and framework for describing the actions an adversary takes while operating within an enterprise network. It characterizes post-compromise adversary behavior, distilling common behaviors across known intrusion activity into individual or combinations of actions. The TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) described in ATT&CK are based on observed APT intrusions from public reporting and are included at a level of abstraction necessary for prioritizing defensive investments and comparing endpoint intrusion detection capabilities.

#### Post-Compromise Threat-Based Modeling
ATT&CK addresses a gap in the community’s understanding of specific post-compromise intrusion details. Public reports often lack critical information needed to defend against intruder techniques. For example, general mentions of lateral movement without specific details do not help organizations defend against that tactic. MITRE created the ATT&CK model to provide detailed, empirical information grounded in observed and plausible adversary behavior.

#### Tactics
Tactics represent the highest level of abstraction within the ATT&CK model, describing the tactical goals an adversary has during an operation. The ATT&CK tactic categories include:

- **Persistence**: Maintaining access to systems through interruptions.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Obtaining higher permissions on a system or network.
- **Defense Evasion**: Evading detection or other defenses.
- **Credential Access**: Gaining control over system, domain, or service credentials.
- **Discovery**: Gaining knowledge about a system and its internal network.
- **Lateral Movement**: Accessing and controlling remote systems on a network.
- **Execution**: Executing adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system.
- **Collection**: Identifying and gathering sensitive information.
- **Exfiltration**: Removing files and information from a target network.
- **Command and Control**: Communicating with systems under control within a target network.

These tactics are applicable from one endpoint to the next as an adversary moves across a network, providing a detailed and actionable framework for defending against APTs.

By following these principles and leveraging the ATT&CK model, organizations can enhance their detection capabilities and better protect their networks from sophisticated threats.
