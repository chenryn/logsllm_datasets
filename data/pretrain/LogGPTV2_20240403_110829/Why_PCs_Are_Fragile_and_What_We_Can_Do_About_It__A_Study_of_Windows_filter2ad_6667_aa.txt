## Abstract
Software configuration issues are a significant source of failures in computer systems. This paper introduces a new framework for categorizing these problems, with a specific focus on Windows Registry-related issues. These issues, although infrequent, are challenging to diagnose and repair, leading to user frustration. By classifying problems based on their manifestation and impact, we gain valuable insights into how these issues affect users and why PCs are fragile. We then propose techniques to identify and mitigate such Registry failures, including health predicate monitoring, fault injection, and access protection mechanisms.

## 1. Introduction
Windows-based personal computers (PCs) offer a versatile platform for software interactions. However, the undisciplined use and sharing of persistent configuration data by Windows programs have made PCs more susceptible to fragility. The Windows Registry, which stores large amounts of complex, undocumented, and unprotected configuration data, is particularly vulnerable. Understanding and resolving Registry damage is a non-trivial task for the average user and is equally burdensome for system and application developers.

In this paper, we characterize how Registry problems impact users and suggest measures to alleviate and prevent future occurrences. Our analysis is based on two sets of real-world failure data: 100 common Registry problems from a database of Product Support Services (PSS) email logs, and 100 problems encountered by our colleagues and posted on various web forums. Through the analysis of 200 cases, we develop a categorization framework that covers two orthogonal axes: problem manifestation and scope of impact, and mitigation techniques.

An extended version of this paper, including a survey of related work and monitoring tools, is available in [1]. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the Registry, Section 3 describes the two fragility data sets, Sections 4 and 5 categorize problems based on manifestation, impact, and mitigation techniques, and Section 6 concludes.

## 2. Registry Overview
The Windows Registry serves as a hierarchical, shared repository for named and typed configuration data, accessed by both the operating system and application software. The Registry is divided into hives, each containing sets of keys, sub-keys, and items related to components such as System, Software, and Hardware. Hives distinguish between per-user and system-wide settings. Each key can be viewed as a directory that may contain sub-keys and Registry items, which store the actual configuration information as typed data. Access to each Registry item is achieved by navigating through a designated path of keys and sub-keys.

## 3. Fragility Data Sets
We collected data using two methods. First, we used text-mining tools to extract data from PSS logs. Since these logs contain limited root cause analysis information, our second dataset comprised problems encountered by our colleagues and web forum users. We used the Strider Troubleshooter [3] to diagnose and reproduce these problems.

### 3.1. Text-Mined Data Set (TMDS) from PSS
We analyzed problems reported via emails to a PSS organization from March 20, 1997, to May 20, 2003. PSS helps customers resolve issues by maintaining a knowledge base of known problems and solutions. From approximately 2.4 million problems reported during this period, 101,900 (4.4%) contained references to about 143,157 Registry keys/items. Only 5,266 unique entries were identified, and we extracted 10,405 summary-containing problems for analysis.

### 3.2. Strider-Verified Data Set (SVDS)
To further understand and experience Registry fragility, we collected, reproduced, and resolved Registry problems using the Strider Troubleshooter [3, 4]. This tool performs a "diff" operation on two Registry snapshots (pre-problem good state and post-manifestation bad state), intersects it with a trace of operations leading to the problem, and ranks potential causal entries. We collected 100 problems from our colleagues, a helpdesk organization, and web forums, focusing on issues related to Windows XP SP1. For known root causes, we reproduced the misconfigurations to study symptoms. For unknown solutions, we used the Strider Troubleshooter to identify root causes and manually verified repairs.

## 4. Why PCs Are Fragile
### 4.1. Problem Manifestation
PC fragility manifestations on users' machines can be classified into seven distinct categories:

1. **Unstable/Unusable System**: Certain Registry misconfigurations cause severe loss of critical functionality or compromise the system. For example, changing `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\windowsNT\currentversion\Winlogon\Userinit` from `C:\WINDOWS\system32\userinit.exe` to `C:\WINDOWS\system32\userinit.exe;` prevents user login, making the system unusable.

2. **Cannot Perform a Function or Action**: Users may be unable to perform desired tasks. For instance, if `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.mp3\PerceivedType` has a data value other than "audio" (e.g., "text"), the "Play All" function in the "My Music" folder will not play .mp3 files.

3. **Unanticipated Response**: Users may encounter unexpected responses. For example, double-clicking a folder opens a search-results window instead of the folder if `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\(Default)` is empty.

4. **Unanticipated Side-Effect**: Some side effects are caused by poor program design. For example, installing a new CD burner might rename the "A" drive to "H" drive, causing an error when the user types "A:\".

5. **Cannot Locate User Interface to Perform a Task**: Sometimes, a user interface is hidden under several levels of menus. For example, once a user selects "Don't offer to remember any more passwords" in Internet Explorer, it is difficult to restore the setting to prompt for password storage.

6. **User Interface Disappears but Functionality is Preserved**: In some cases, the user interface for a task is absent or tainted, but the task can be executed by other means, such as command-line invocation. For example, if a UI-related key is deleted, Control Panel > Network Connections may show nothing, but all network connections remain intact.

7. **Program Adaptation or Automation is Performed Unexpectedly**: Automation decisions may lead to unexpected behavior. For example, a program might automatically update settings in a way that confuses the user.

These classifications provide a comprehensive view of how Registry issues manifest and impact users, highlighting the need for robust mitigation strategies.
