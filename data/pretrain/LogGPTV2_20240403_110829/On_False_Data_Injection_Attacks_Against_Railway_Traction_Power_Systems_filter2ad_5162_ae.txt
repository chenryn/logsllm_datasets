when there is at least one regenerating train under attack.
This is in contrast to the 28.3% for the TPS without BDD.
This result is consistent with our discussion in Section V-B
that the BDD can reduce the impact of efﬁciency attacks.

Fig. 8: Effect of efﬁciency attacks on the TPS with BDD under different
settings of Δsi and ΔVi.
We also examine the effect of efﬁciency attacks on the
TPS with BDD under different settings of Δsi and ΔVi
in Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b, respectively. From these ﬁgures,
we can see that, under smaller settings of Δsi and ΔVi,
the efﬁciency loss caused by the FDI attack diminishes.
For instance, the efﬁciency loss is as low as 1.37% when
Δsi = 0.1 km. In practice, the TPS monitor can estimate
the present train position based on the train’s speed and its
position at the previous time instant when it was known
that there were no attacks. The present position reading can
be compared with the estimated position using Eq. (15).
The setting of Δsi should consider natural errors of train
positioning systems and the estimation error. Existing train
positioning systems such as GPS and Balise can achieve
an accuracy of ﬁve to ten meters [32], [33]. Thus, it is
reasonable to assume that the combined effect of the train
positioning system error and the estimation error is less
than 0.1 km. Our results show that by properly tuning the
BDD’s attack detection parameters (e.g., Δsi and ΔVi), the
efﬁciency loss caused by FDI attacks can be signiﬁcantly
reduced.
2) Safety Attacks: The ﬁrst set of simulations evaluates
the impact of safety attacks on the TPS without BDD. Under
safety attacks, the regenerating trains inject more power into
the power network than that under no attacks, resulting in
increased voltages. We say that the TPS experiences a safety
breach when at least one node in the TPS experiences a
safety breach. In the simulations, we observed that the TPS
experiences safety breaches for a total of eight seconds. The
prolonged overvoltage may cause safety incidents.
The second set of simulations evaluates the impact of
safety attacks on the TPS with BDD. In these simulations,
the TPS experiences safety breaches for a total of four

seconds, compared with eight seconds in the absence of
BDD. Table IV summarizes the time durations of safety
breaches under different settings of Δsi. When Δsi is in
the range of 0.1 km to 0.3 km, the attack causes no safety
breaches during the simulations. As discussed previously,
the setting Δsi = 0.1 km is appropriate in practice. Hence,
this set of results shows that by appropriately setting the
BDD parameters, safety breaches can be nearly eliminated.
3) SAD Algorithm: The last set of simulations evaluates
the effectiveness of SAD in detecting attacks that have
bypassed the BDD. For each time instant,
the attacker
tactically chooses the attack vector closest to the true sys-
tem state in the sense of the p-norm distance, among the
discrete solutions to the BDD bypass condition discussed in
Section V-C. We compare our practical approach where the
vpr is the nodal voltage vector at the previous time instant
(cf. Algorithm 1), with an oracle approach where the vpr
is the nodal voltage vector at the present time instant in the
absence of attack. Fig. 9 shows the J∗ computed by Step
2 of Algorithm 1 during the entire simulation, as well as
the ||˜v − vpr||p under the oracle approach and the practical
approach, where p = 2. In Fig. 9, we skip plotting a data
point for a time instant when the attacker cannot bypass
the BDD. For the oracle approach, from the top ﬁgure of
Fig. 9, the ||˜v− vpr||p is consistently higher than the J∗ for
the entire simulation. This suggests that the oracle approach
can detect the onset of a BDD-stealthy attack launched at
any time instant. For the practical approach, from the bottom
ﬁgure of Fig. 9, the ||˜v − vpr||p is higher than the J∗
for 96% of the simulation time. For the remaining 4% of
simulation time, the practical approach will miss the attack
onset because of a signiﬁcant change of v from the previous
time instant to the present. This shows that the practical
approach can detect the attack onset with a high probability.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we studied FDI attacks on train-borne
sensor measurements used in railway TPSes. To the best

of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst effort studying TPSes
from a cybersecurity perspective. To account for the safety-
criticality of TPS, we adopted the Kerckhoffs’s principle and
addressed two fundamental problems of importance, namely,
characterization of the impact of FDI attacks on TPSes, and
development of detection techniques for these attacks. We
formulated and analyzed the efﬁciency and safety attacks
that aim to minimize the system energy efﬁciency and
breach system safety conditions, respectively. To detect these
attacks, we proposed a global detection system that serializes
the proposed BDD and SAD algorithms, both of which may
be implemented at a central TPS monitor. Our simulation
results veriﬁed the susceptibility of a TPS setup to the FDI
attacks, but these attacks can be detected effectively by the
proposed global detection system.
