### Impact of Efficiency Attacks on TPS with and without BDD

When at least one regenerating train is under attack, the impact on the Train Power System (TPS) varies significantly depending on whether Bounded Detection and Defense (BDD) is implemented. Specifically, in the absence of BDD, the TPS experiences a 28.3% efficiency loss due to such attacks. This result aligns with our discussion in Section V-B, which highlights that BDD can mitigate the impact of efficiency attacks.

#### Simulation Results

- **Table IV** summarizes the time duration during which the TPS experiences safety breaches under different settings of Δsi (in kilometers) in the presence of BDD.
  - **Δsi (km)**: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5
  - **Time duration of safety breaches (s)**: 0, 0, 0, 1, 4

- **Fig. 6** shows the effect of efficiency attacks on Train E1 in the absence of BDD.
- **Fig. 7** illustrates the effect of efficiency attacks on Train E1 in the presence of BDD.

#### Effect of Different Settings on Efficiency Loss

We also examined the effect of efficiency attacks on the TPS with BDD under varying settings of Δsi and ΔVi (voltage increment). 

- **Fig. 8a** shows the impact of Δsi (with ΔVi = 50 V and ΔIi = 200 A).
- **Fig. 8b** shows the impact of ΔVi (with Δsi = 0.5 km and ΔIi = 200 A).

From these figures, it is evident that smaller values of Δsi and ΔVi lead to a reduction in efficiency loss. For instance, when Δsi = 0.1 km, the efficiency loss is as low as 1.37%.

In practice, the TPS monitor can estimate the current train position based on its speed and the last known position when no attacks were present. The estimated position can be compared with the actual position using Equation (15). The setting of Δsi should account for natural errors in train positioning systems and estimation errors. Current train positioning systems like GPS and Balise achieve an accuracy of five to ten meters [32], [33]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the combined error from the positioning system and estimation is less than 0.1 km. Our results indicate that by appropriately tuning the BDD's attack detection parameters (e.g., Δsi and ΔVi), the efficiency loss caused by False Data Injection (FDI) attacks can be significantly reduced.

### Safety Attacks

#### Without BDD

The first set of simulations evaluates the impact of safety attacks on the TPS without BDD. Under safety attacks, regenerating trains inject more power into the network, leading to increased voltages. We define a safety breach as occurring when at least one node in the TPS experiences overvoltage. In the simulations, the TPS experienced safety breaches for a total of eight seconds, which could potentially cause safety incidents due to prolonged overvoltage.

#### With BDD

The second set of simulations evaluates the impact of safety attacks on the TPS with BDD. In this case, the TPS experienced safety breaches for a total of four seconds, compared to eight seconds without BDD. Table IV provides a summary of the time durations of safety breaches under different settings of Δsi. When Δsi is in the range of 0.1 km to 0.3 km, the attack causes no safety breaches during the simulations. As discussed earlier, setting Δsi = 0.1 km is practical. Hence, this set of results demonstrates that by appropriately setting the BDD parameters, safety breaches can be nearly eliminated.

### SAD Algorithm

The final set of simulations evaluates the effectiveness of the State Anomaly Detection (SAD) algorithm in detecting attacks that have bypassed the BDD. At each time instant, the attacker tactically chooses the attack vector closest to the true system state in terms of p-norm distance, among the discrete solutions to the BDD bypass condition discussed in Section V-C. We compare our practical approach, where vpr is the nodal voltage vector at the previous time instant, with an oracle approach where vpr is the nodal voltage vector at the present time instant in the absence of attack.

- **Fig. 9** shows the J* computed by Step 2 of Algorithm 1 during the entire simulation, as well as the ||˜v − vpr||p under the oracle and practical approaches, with p = 2.
  - **Oracle Approach**: The ||˜v − vpr||p is consistently higher than J* for the entire simulation, indicating that the oracle approach can detect the onset of a BDD-stealthy attack launched at any time instant.
  - **Practical Approach**: The ||˜v − vpr||p is higher than J* for 96% of the simulation time. For the remaining 4%, the practical approach may miss the attack onset due to significant changes in v from the previous to the present time instant. This suggests that the practical approach can detect the attack onset with high probability.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we studied FDI attacks on train-borne sensor measurements used in railway TPSes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to study TPSes from a cybersecurity perspective. We addressed two fundamental problems: characterizing the impact of FDI attacks on TPSes and developing detection techniques for these attacks. We formulated and analyzed efficiency and safety attacks, and proposed a global detection system that serializes the BDD and SAD algorithms. Our simulation results verified the susceptibility of a TPS setup to FDI attacks and demonstrated that these attacks can be effectively detected by the proposed global detection system.
