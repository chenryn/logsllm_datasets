User: There is an existing web server, and the caching strategy of Nginx needs to be adjusted to improve the performance of the website. Please analyze the visit situation of the website, and propose appropriate caching strategies and optimization suggestions.
Assistant: 1. Analyze website visits - The main content of the website is static resources (such as html, css, js files) and pictures. - The website has a large number of visits, but the concurrent requests are not high, mainly sequential visits. - The users of the website are mainly from China, and some users need to access across overseas bandwidth. 2. Caching strategy and optimization suggestions - For caching of static resources, consider using header information such as Expires and Cache-Control to set the caching time to reduce repeated requests. At the same time, you can use the proxy_cache module of Nginx to cache the accessed resources locally, and read directly from the local next time to improve the access speed. - For image caching, an independent domain name method can be used to resolve the domain name of the image to the CDN, and let the CDN process the request to improve the access speed and stability of the image. - For the access of overseas users, you can use the upstream module of Nginx to distribute the requests of overseas users to servers with excellent network quality, so as to improve the access speed and stability of users. - You can use the gzip module of Nginx to compress the static resources of the website, reduce the amount of transmitted data, and improve the access speed. - You can use the access_log module of Nginx to record access logs and analyze them regularly, discover and solve access bottlenecks and problems in time, and improve the performance and stability of the website.
