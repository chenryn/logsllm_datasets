User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can employer see ssl content on wifi Doing research, I haven't found anything specific to my question. I work for a small local company with 15 employees. I originally hooked up the internet but we hired an I.T. Company recently. We have a Sophos firewall, hooked to an hp switch. The wifi router is connected to the switch. The I.T. Company put a "file sharing" computer on the switch and I know they said there is computer performance monitoring on that computer. They have a VNC, and agent and all that on the computers for monitoring.

My question is wifi. The log-in is generic, not per-person. Just need the wifi password. So if I connect my phone to work wifi and am using an app that defaults to ssl such as Tumblr for example. I'm curious as to if they can see the content? I do not care if they can see that I opened the tumblr app, but can they see WHAT I was looking at or searching. I know the firewall does not have any filtering or monitoring turned on because I can access it, but I don't know what they have on the computer they hooked up. And my phone does not have any company certs installed on it.

Assistant: In general no, without certs installed on the user's computer, SSL traffic won't be visible. 

They could play tricks with non-SSL connections, but if the app successfully creates the SSL tunnel, it should be safe.
