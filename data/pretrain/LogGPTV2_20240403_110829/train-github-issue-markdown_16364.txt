we have setup one kubernetes cluster to test the HA if support to transfer the
container with the cinder volume plugin. I have three nodes. One Master Node,
and two Nodes are minion nodes. I install with cinder volume plugin
successfully.  
1.I use the case to create the pod on A minion node. It can run well. And the
cinder can also be attached to the container.  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: ReplicationController

# Enter the volume ID below  
volumeID: 37ef6468-dfde-4468-8317-2c4142a6827f  
fsType: ext4  
2\. I stop the A minion by the command "nova stop instance_id", But I find the
status of pod is ContainerCreating all the time. I find the cinder volume
isn't attached to the B minion node if HA supports, and the B minion node
don't find the container to be transfered.
From our test, it seems kubernetes HA Not support this container with cinder
volume plugin to transfer to the another minion node.  
Could any kubernetes developers confirmed that ?
