It seems you are experiencing an issue with your local HTTP server (BottlePy or Django) where the server responds immediately when accessed via `http://localhost/` or `http://127.0.0.1/`, but takes several minutes to load when using your local IP address (`192.168.1.100`). 

Here are a few steps you can take to diagnose and potentially resolve this problem:

1. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Run the command `host 192.168.1.100` on the host machine to check if there are any DNS resolution issues.
   - Ensure that other DNS queries are being processed quickly.

2. **Hosts File**:
   - Check the `/etc/hosts` file to see if there are any entries for `192.168.1.100`. If not, you can add one as a quick solution:
     ```plaintext
     192.168.1.100    localhost
     ```

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Verify that your network configuration is correct and that there are no firewall rules or network settings that might be causing delays.
   - Ensure that the IP address `192.168.1.100` is correctly assigned to the server and that there are no conflicts or misconfigurations.

4. **Server Logs**:
   - Check the server logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what is causing the delay. For example, in Django, you can check the `django.log` file, and in BottlePy, you can enable logging to see more details.

5. **Ping Test**:
   - Perform a ping test to `192.168.1.100` to see if there are any network latency issues:
     ```sh
     ping 192.168.1.100
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue. If the problem persists, please provide additional details about your network setup and any relevant log entries for further assistance.
