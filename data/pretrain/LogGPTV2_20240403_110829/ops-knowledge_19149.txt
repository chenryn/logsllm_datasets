User: I have such problem. I have local http server (BottlePy or Django), and when i use http:// localhost/ or http:// 127.0.0.1/ - it loads immediately. But when i use my local ip (192.168.1.100), it loads very long time (some minutes). What could be the problem?
Server works on Ubuntu 11.
Assistant: It looks like that you have problems with DNS. can you check this idea running host 192.168.1.100 on the host? Please also check that other DNS queries being quickly processed. 
Check /etc/hosts file for a quick-and-dirty solution.
