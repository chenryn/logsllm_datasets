## From Welfare State to Partner State: The Case of Welcome to Saint-Gilles

**Virginia Tassinari**

### Abstract

In contemporary policy-making, citizens are increasingly becoming part of the process of creating the res publica. Both policymakers and civil servants recognize that traditional models of policy-making are inadequate for today's societal needs and challenges. Design can facilitate a shift from a welfare state to a partner state, where Public Innovation Places (PIPs) support and enable social and public innovation. In these spaces, citizens, policymakers, and civil servants collaboratively prototype new societal solutions through co-designed and co-produced public services. This article explores the nature of PIPs, the process of establishing them, and the role of design schools, drawing on the experience of the "Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project. It also delves into theoretical and philosophical reflections on these experimental places.

### 1. Introduction

Worldwide, we are witnessing the rise of people-powered public services, co-produced by citizens, civil servants, and policymakers. These initiatives signal a paradigm shift from the traditional welfare state to a new model, often referred to as the "partner state" or "relational state." This emerging model is based on the direct participation of citizens in the co-creation of public services.

This article will explore the idea of the partner state as a state of exception, drawing on historical and philosophical perspectives. It will also examine the steps needed to fuel this paradigm shift, the role of people-powered public services, and the physical spaces where such services can be co-produced, known as Public Innovation Places (PIPs).

#### 1.1 An Emerging Alternative Political Paradigm

Key questions arise in our contemporary landscape: Who is responsible for policy-making? Is there a change in the concept of citizenship? How does the financial crisis influence this? Is a new model of policy-making emerging?

Examples such as community gardens, urban farming, and co-housing projects illustrate the blurring lines between public and private. These bottom-up initiatives suggest a new political paradigm, with terms like "public engagement" and "participation" becoming mainstream. However, the shift from top-down to participatory policy-making still needs further exploration and development.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau described a major shift in policy-making from the state of nature to the social pact, which he saw as the beginning of politics. He believed that the social pact shaped human nature. Can the current shift towards a more participatory model be seen as a new social pact, and what implications would this have for human nature?

This article aims to formulate new questions rather than provide definitive answers. Philosophy and design can work together to better understand this paradigm shift, which affects not only politics but also human nature.

Hilary Cottam, a UK designer, has described this shift as a result of co-creating solutions to societal challenges, involving citizens in decision-making. She emphasizes the importance of human relationships and describes a "relational state," where the private citizen is more actively involved in policy-making.

Michel Bauwens uses the term "partner state" to describe a move away from hierarchical models to distributed networks, where the state supports and organizes the productive activities of networks. This third mode of governance, governed by the community of producers, represents a new partnership between the public and private realms.

We will look at examples of people-powered public services that contribute to the creation of a partner state.

### 2. People-Powered Public Services

#### 2.1 The State as Partner: Concrete Cases

Many examples exist where policymakers and civil servants facilitate and support services created through collaboration with citizens. For instance, the Institute Without Boundaries and the Dublin Institute of Technology are working on the "City Systems: Innovation in Public Service Delivery for the 21st Century City" project in Dublin. Design students work with local organizations and authorities to co-design public services, engaging both Dubliners and civil servants in the process.

Authorities sometimes initiate these collaborations, while other times, design schools or social design companies take the initiative. Society shows a growing need for participation in policy-making, suggesting a potential future where a wide range of public services could be co-produced by private citizens.

#### 2.2 Welcome to Saint-Gilles

As a design school, we have been working with seven other design schools in the Euregio Meuse-Rhine on the "Sustainability at School #3 / Welcome to Saint-Gilles" project. We collaborated with the local community of Saint-Gilles, a neighborhood in Liège, Belgium, to address their needs and co-create solutions.

After mapping the neighborhood and identifying key challenges, students worked with the local community to develop around 100 micro-projects aimed at enhancing social cohesion and resilience. These projects were presented at the International Design Biennial Reciprocity, and the local community provided feedback.

Following the exhibition, residents adopted and implemented some of the projects, tuning them to their needs and forming a new neighborhood committee. This partnership between the inhabitants of Saint-Gilles and the public authorities exemplifies how people-powered public services can change the way we understand policy-making.

The cluster Public & Collaborative, along with the DESIS network, continues to support and facilitate such collaborative efforts.
