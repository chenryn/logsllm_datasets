FROM WELFARE STATE TO PARTNER STATE:  
THE CASE OF WELCOME TO SAINT-GILLES
Virginia Tassinari
ABSTRACT
Nowadays, we are witnessing a shift in policy making, in which citizens are increasingly becoming 
part of the process of creating the res publica. Both policy makers and civil servants are starting to 
realize that the old models of policy making are becoming inadequate to contemporary society’s 
needs and challenges. Within this framework, design can help to facilitate a shift towards new 
models that lead from a welfare state towards a partner state. Public Innovation Places (PIP) are 
places where such experimentations on the ground of social and public innovation are supported 
and facilitated.  Here citizens, policy makers and civil servants prototype new societal solutions 
in a collaborative fashion, through co-designed and co-produced public services. PIP represent 
the exception to our society where it is eventually possible to grow a new idea of policy making  
alternative to the current one. This article shares a series of reflections on the nature of these places, 
looking at the process that eventually can lead to establish a PIP and at the role of design schools 
therein - starting from the concrete experience of the project Welcome to Saint-Gilles. Furthermore, 
this article will also present a more theoretical and philosophical reflections on the nature of these 
experimental places.

1.  INTRODUCTION
Worldwide we are currently witnessing the rise 
of services co-produced by common citizens, civil 
servants and policy makers, i.e. what we call people-
powered public services . There are several examples 
of initiatives  similar to one another which are proving 
successful. One could assert that these initiatives can 
be read as signals of a paradigm shift, which leads 
from the idea of the welfare state as we know it - with 
all the different configurations this concept assumed 
in the different geographical, economical and socio-
political contexts in which it has developed  - towards 
something new. This emerging idea of state, based on 
the direct participation of citizens in the co-creation of 
public services, has been recently defined in different 
ways: for instance as “partner state”  and “relational 
state” . 
In the following pages a brief journey will be taken 
through the history of philosophy in order to frame 
the idea of partner state as a state of exception.  The 
“state of exception” is linked to notion of the exception 
grounding the rule. As such, the partner state as a 
state of exception can become the basis for a new 
paradigm of governance, as an alternative to the 
current mainstream one. 
Finally, attention will be paid to possible steps 
which can fuel the paradigm shift, the role of 
people-powered public services therein, the physical 
touchpoints supporting such services, and the physical 
spaces where they can be co-produced, i.e. Public 
Innovation Places (PIP).
1.1 An emerging alternative political paradigm
We might ask ourselves: Who is in charge of policy 
making nowadays? Is there a change taking place in the 
idea of citizenship? How is the financial crisis playing a 
role in all this? Is there a new model of policy making 
emerging? 
These are the kind of questions which arise in our 
contemporary landscape, as we witness a growing 
amount of examples worldwide - such as community 
gardens, urban farming initiatives, co-housing projects, 
and so on7 - which illustrate that it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to trace a distinct line separating 
public from private. All such examples show empirically 
how the process of decision making concerning the 
res publica no longer seems to be only in the hands 
of policy makers, but is slowly also becoming also 
a prerogative of private citizens. One can see these 
bottom up initiatives as weak signals of an emerging 
political paradigm, alternative to the current one. 
Words such as “public engagement” and “participation” 
have moved from the specialist’s vocabulary into the 
mainstream vocabulary of contemporary society. They 
are key terms which redefine the meaning of the 
word “policy”. Yet, although these words have become 
more common, one has the impression that this shift 
in policy making - from top down towards bottom up, 
from hierarchical towards participative - still needs to 
be further questioned, challenged and develop. What is 
the nature of the shift they represent? What could be 
the consequences for contemporary society?
In order to reply to these questions, one probably needs 
to look at how we used to manage with other shifts 
in models of policy making in the past. How did we 
interpret them? The French philosopher Jean Jacques 
Rousseau describes a major shift in policy making’s 
model, from one based on rules which originate in the 
state of nature - which cannot be called political yet - to 
one grounded on the social pact. He sees in this a sign 
of the beginning of the idea of politics. 
In his “Discours sur l’origine et les fondements de 
l’inégalité parmi les hommes”8 Rousseau stated that 
the social pact led man out of the state of nature. So, 
what constitutes the modern human nature has in his 
eyes to do with the configuration of the social pact. He 
considered the social pact as something that formed 
human nature and determined man’s character. As 
such, that which affects and changes the social pact 
also ends up affecting and changing human nature. 
Can we consider this shift towards a more participatory 
model of policy making as a new social pact emerging 
between citizen and state? If we assume that the 
emergence of an alternative political paradigm we are 
witnessing actually represents a new social pact, which 
repercussions would this have on human nature? Which 
new idea of “man” would ensue from this?  
The aim of this article is not to find answers to those 
questions, but rather to formulate new questions. 
Our first feeling is that one probably needs to look at 
90
these complex issues through multiple lenses starting 
from the concrete practices from within which some 
of these questions arise. Both philosophy and design 
can work hand in hand here in order to come to a 
better understanding of this paradigm shift, which - if 
we follow Rousseau’s argumentation - does not solely 
affect politics but also human nature itself.
The UK designer Hilary Cottam has recently attempted 
to describe the shift at hand in more detail, starting 
from her personal experience in the creation of people-
powered public services with her design collective 
Participle9. Cottam reads this shift largely as the result 
of the co-creation of solutions that eventually allow 
people to face societal challenges - such as ageing 
and wellbeing - in which the citizens, and not only 
policy makers, are involved in the decision making. She 
describes this as a “more social, collaborative approach 
to welfare.”10 Cottam also stresses the importance of 
human relationships in this shift. 
She writes: “Key features of these new approaches 
to care, education, welfare, food and energy are the 
intensive use of distributed systems; blurred boundaries 
between production and consumption; an emphasis on 
collaboration; and a strong role for personal values and 
missions.”11
“The aim of this article is 
not to find answers to those 
questions, but rather to 
formulate new questions. ”
This “emphasis on collaboration” is reflected in the 
definition she gives of a new model of state, i.e. a 
“relational state”12. Through this term, she indicates a 
shift from the welfare state towards a new social pact 
amongst state and citizen, in which the private citizen 
is incrementally more and more actively involved in 
the policy making process. 
Cottam appears to find in human relationship the key 
feature that leads us from the welfare state towards 
what she calls the relational state, a new model for the 
creation of public services which is “shared, collective 
and relational.”13
91
 Michel Bauwens uses a similar term, i.e. the “partner 
state”14 which to him represents a move away 
from a hierarchical model of policy making to one 
in which political, economic, and social systems 
transform themselves into distributed networks, i.e. 
“a transformed state that moves from being a patron of 
corporate interests to being a supporter and organizer of 
the networks’ productive activities.”15 
The network becomes the way in which citizens can 
participate in the process of decision making of the 
res publica. Besides public and private one can foresee, 
according to Bauwens, a third way, not solely public 
and yet not solely private. He names it “the third 
mode of governance”16 and defines it in the following 
terms: “... (it) is governed by the community of producers 
themselves, and not by market allocation or corporate 
hierarchy: this is the Pear to Pear governance mode, or 
‘third mode of governance’.”17 
This third way of governance is central to the partner 
state, in which private and public realm work together 
in a network-like fashion and by doing so create a new 
model of state. 
We will look at some examples in which people-
powered public services illustrate how they can 
contribute to the creation of a new partnership 
amongst private citizens and the public sector, to a 
“partner state”.
2. PEOPLE-POWERED PUBLIC SERVICES
2.1 The state as partner: concrete cases of People-powered 
public services
There are many examples where policy makers and 
civil servants facilitate and support services created 
through their collaboration with citizens, i.e. what 
we call people-powered public services. For instance, 
the Institute Without Boundaries18 and the Dublin 
Institute of Technology19 are at this moment working 
together on a project called “City Systems: Innovation 
in Public Service Delivery for the 21st Century City”20 
in which they - as a design school - facilitate the co-
design process amongst citizens, civil servants and 
policy makers of the city of Dublin. The students have 
been asked to work for five weeks in the city of Dublin 
together with local organizations and local authorities: 
Design Twenty-first Century21, the Dublin City Council22 
and particularly with an initiative of the Dublin City 
Council23 called The Studio24, a public office dedicated 
to provoke and involve participation - between citizens 
and civil servants - in the design of public services.25 
In the preliminary research phase of this project 
both Dubliners and Dublin’s civil servants have been 
strongly engaged in becoming a pro-active element 
in the creation of new services and becoming, in 
Bauwens’ terms, partners of the state. In this process 
the public authorities were conscious about the 
necessity arising within their city to find alternative 
models for the creation of public services. As such, 
they have been inviting design schools - a local one 
together with an international one26 - to collaborate 
and create people-powered public services. 
Authorities are sometimes, as in this particular case, 
co-initiators. Nevertheless, the records are most 
variable. Sometimes it is up to design schools to 
see opportunities and take, as pro-active agents of 
social change, initiatives without being explicitly 
asked to do so by public authorities.27 Other times it 
is up to service/social design companies or NGO’s to 
take up this challenge, often in collaboration with 
design schools.28 In the majority of cases, when 
such initiatives take off, it usually happens out of a 
spontaneous, sincere and tangible sense of urgency. 
Society itself shows signals of a growing need 
to express its participation at all levels of policy 
making. 
There are many other examples of the citizen’s will to 
participate in creating a new society in an everyday 
fashion, starting up or engaging in new initiatives 
concerning for instance mobility, waste management, 
and so on. If this signal we are identifying in society 
corresponds to a real movement of change, could this 
mean - by extreme extrapolation - that in the future 
the full range of public services could be covered by 
private citizens? To follow in the footsteps of Peter 
Sloterdijk’s provocation29: does this mean we will not 
need a Welfare State anymore? 
Instead of the radicalism of Sloterdijk’s point of view, 
we could see herein also the possibility of the model 
introduced by Bauwens, in which one does not get rid 
of the welfare state but rather re-thinks it as part of a 
new constellation of collaboration between authorities 
and private citizens as partners. Instead of the state 
producing services, we will possibly have the state co-
producing services in a network-like manner together 
with citizens and public service institutions. This is no 
mainstream model yet. Nevertheless, as we already 
mentioned, there are various examples, tangible signs 
that we could interpret as weak signals of a shift 
towards a partner state, as ‘replacing’ the welfare 
state in the way in which we currently know it in most 
Western, industrialized societies.30 
In order to further understand how this collaboration 
between pubic and private realms can collaborate in a 
third way of governance, we will look more closely at 
a specific case on which we have been working in the 
last year. 
2.2 Welcome to Saint-Gilles
As a design school we have been working together 
with seven other design schools in the Euregio 
Meuse-Rhine31 within the framework of a project 
entitled “Sustainability at school #3 / Welcome to 
Saint-Gilles”32. Together possibilities have been created 
for civil servants, policy makers and citizens of a 
neighborhood of the city of Liège (B) called Saint-
Gilles to collaborate and co-create solutions as an 
answer to the neighborhood’s needs. For a full year, 
the design schools involved in the project 33 worked 
together with the local community, exploring explicit 
and latent needs to be addressed. New collaborative 
solutions were envisioned to develop in, with and for 
the neighborhood of Saint-Gilles. The initiative to do 
so came from the public sector.34 
After mapping the neighborhood together with design 
educators and local stakeholders a series of key 
challenges35 were identified. Students worked on them 
together with the local community36, which resulted 
in about a 100 micro-projects, of which some were 
neighborhood interventions, products, and co-produced 
services all aimed at enhancing the social cohesion 
and resilience of the neighborhood.37 
All concepts were 
collected, clustered, 
and presented within 
an exhibition of the 
International Design 
Biennial Reciprocity 
which took place within 
the neighborhood of 
Saint-Gilles itself.38 Also 
92
during the exhibition, the local community was 
asked to give its feedback and thus to continue the 
conversation in which it had become engaged from 
the beginning of the academic year onwards. After the 
exhibition it soon became clear how spontaneously 
the inhabitants of Saint-Gilles adopted some of the 
projects and started to implement them.39 
They started ‘tuning” the prototypes to their needs 
and actual resources, sometimes blending them 
together in an unexpected way.40 The local inhabitants, 
thanks to the work of the students of our partner 
ID campus, recently formed a new neighborhood 
committee or “street movement” 41, as they called 
it, which is now working to develop some of the 
micro-projects proposed. These micro-projects have 
become seeds of a new kind of relationship which 
is forming between the inhabitants of Saint-Gilles 
and the public authorities of Liège: a partnership. 
Again, people-powered public services showed to 
contribute to create this partnership between private 
citizen and the public sector, which changes the way 
in which we intend the word “policy”. The cluster 
Public & Collaborative42, together with the DESIS
