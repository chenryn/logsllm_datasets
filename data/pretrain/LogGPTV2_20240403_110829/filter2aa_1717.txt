## Introduction
This talk discusses my explorations into mainframe security, specifically focusing on IBM z/OS systems. The goal is to share insights and techniques that I discovered while experimenting with these systems in my spare time.

---

## Mainframe Overview
- **z/OS**: The most popular operating system for mainframes.
- **Version 2.1**: Recently released, showing that mainframes are still evolving and not just legacy systems.

---

## z/OS Demonstration
Let's take a closer look at z/OS and see how it works. This will help provide context for the rest of the presentation.

---

## Ettercap Demonstration
A brief demonstration of using Ettercap for network manipulation and analysis.

---

## CGI-Bin in 2014
- **REXX / SH Scripts**: Still widely used in mainframe environments.
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**: Simple if you know TSO commands.

---

## FTP Exploitation
- **FTP Access**: Allows running JCL (Job Control Language) scripts.
- **Command Example**: `SITE FILE=JES`

---

## Access Granted
- **FTP Script Account**: Gained access via FTP.
- **Ettercap**: Used for further network analysis.

---

## Privilege Escalation
- **Telnet/SSH/3270**: Common methods to connect and escalate privileges.
- **Local Privilege Escalation**: Techniques to gain higher-level access.

---

## getroot.rx
- **REXX Script**: Leverages CVE-2012-5951 to exploit a vulnerability in IBM Tivoli NetView.
- **Vulnerability Details**: Unspecified vulnerability allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to the normal Unix System Services (USS) security level.

---

## Demo
A live demonstration of the techniques discussed.

---

## Maintaining Access
- **RACF Database**: Obtain a copy of the RACF database.
- **John the Ripper**: Use `racf2john` to convert the RACF database to a format that can be cracked, then use John the Ripper to crack the hashes.

---

## Stealing Credentials
- **IRRDBU00**: Convert RACF to a flat file.
- **SPECIAL Accounts**: Search for and log in with SPECIAL accounts.

---

## Owning the System
- **SPECIAL Privileges**: Allows making any changes to user accounts.
- **Adding Users**: Create new users and grant them SPECIAL or OPERATIONS privileges.

---

## BPX.SUPERUSER
- **BPX.SUPERUSER**: Allows users to switch to root without a password.
- **Configuration Example**:
  ```plaintext
  PERMIT BPX.SUPERUSER CLASS(FACILITY) ID(USERID) ACCESS(READ)
  SETROPTS GENERIC(FACILITY) REFRESH
  ```

---

## Tools
- **CATSO**: TSO Bind/Reverse shell.
- **TSHOCKER**: Python/JCL/FTP wrapper for CATSO.
- **MainTP**: Python/JCL/FTP wrapper for getroot.rx and NetEBCDICat.

## Practice Environment
- **RDz (Rational Developer for System z)**: A tool provided by IBM for practicing and testing mainframe development and security.
