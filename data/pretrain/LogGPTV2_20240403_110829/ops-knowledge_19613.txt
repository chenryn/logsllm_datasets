User:  Please describe the characteristics of distributed systems and list common distributed system frameworks.
Assistant: distributed system is a system in which multiple independent computer nodes are connected through a network and work together to complete certain tasks. Its characteristics include the following points: 1. Transparency to nodes: The communication between nodes is transparent to users, and users do not need to consider the location and access method of specific nodes. 2. Heterogeneity: Different operating systems, programming languages, hardware, etc. can be used in a distributed system to achieve heterogeneity of nodes. 3. Scalability: Distributed systems can expand or reduce the size of the system by adding or removing nodes to meet different needs. 4. Fault tolerance: The distributed system adopts technologies such as redundant design and failover, so that the system can continue to work in the event of a failure. Common distributed system frameworks include: 1. Apache Hadoop: Big data analysis and processing framework. 2. Apache Spark: Big data processing framework. 3. Apache ZooKeeper: Coordination service for distributed applications. 4. Apache Cassandra: Distributed NoSQL database. 5. Apache Storm: Distributed real-time data processing framework. 6. Apache Flink: Distributed big data processing framework.
