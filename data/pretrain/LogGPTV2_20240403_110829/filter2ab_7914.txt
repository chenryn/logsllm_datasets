title:blackhat:eu-22 Real-World Detection Evasion Techniques in the Cloud
Recent cloud-focused malware campaigns have shown adversary groups possess an advanced knowledge of cloud technologies and their security mechanisms, with this knowledge being used to their advantage in a range of attacks. These attacks are no longer focused solely on cloud computing environments. Adversaries are now shifting focus to target serverless environments and containers.In this session, Matt will provide an overview of three malware campaigns (CoinStomp, Denonia, Abcbot) where novel TTPs leveraged against cloud technologies were observed. Matt will guide the audience through notable examples of anti-forensics, credential theft and system-weakening techniques used in real-world attacks on cloud infrastructure. This includes techniques such as changing file timestamps post-compromise and evasion at the network level.
