  - Think everything you need to guarantee a good, solid and powerful spring start.
  - Do the year review to adjust your principles.
The year is then divided in two sets of an expansion trimester and a retreat one. We can use this information to adjust our life plan accordingly. In the expansion trimester we could invest more energies in the planning, and in the retreat ones we can do more throughout reviews.
## Trimester review tools
With a new level of abstraction we need tools:
- [Principle documents](#the-principle-document).
- [The life path document](#the-life-path-document).
### The principle documents
Principle documents for me are [orgmode](orgmode.md) documents where I think about the principle itself. It acts both as a way of understanding it and evolving my idea around it, and to build the roadmap to materialize the principle's path.
Without ever having created one I feel that it makes sense to make the reflection part public in the blue book, while I keep for myself the private one. This may also change between principles.
### The life path document
The life path document is an [orgmode](orgmode.md) document where I think about what I want to do with my life and how. It's the highest level of abstraction of the life management system.
The structure so far is as follows:
```orgmode
* Life path
** {year}
*** Principles of {season} {year}
    {Notes on the season}
    - Principle 1
    - Principle 2
    ...
**** Objectives of {month} {year}
     - [-] Objective 1
       - [X] SubObjective 1
       - [ ] SubObjective 2
     - [ ] Objective 2
     - [ ] ...
```
Where the principles are usually links to principle documents and the objectives links to tasks.
## Trimester review phases
We'll divide the review process in these phases:
- Prepare
- Refine 
- Decide 
### Trimester prepare
The trimester review requires an analysis that doesn't fill in a day session. It requires slow thinking over some time. So I'm creating a task 10 days before the actual review to start thinking about the next trimester. Whether it's ideas, plans, desires, objectives, or principles.
Is useful for that document to be available wherever you go, so that in any spare time you can pop it up and continue with the train of thought. 
Doing the reflection without seeing your life path prevents you from being tainted by it, thus representing the real you of right now. 
On the day to actually do the review, follow the steps of the [Month review prepare](#month-prepare) adjusting them to the trimester case.
### Trimester refine
If you've followed the prepare steps, you've already been making up your mind on what do you want the next trimester to look like. Now it's the time to refine those thoughts and compare them with your actual [life path](#the-life-path-document).
#### How to define the trimester objectives
I've had a hard time choosing how must those objectives be defined. Should they be generic? or would it be better for them to be concrete and measurable?
Given the mindset of this review, it's better to have generic open goals. As you climb up the abstraction ladder and work with greater time slots you need to reduce the precision because you have more uncertainty. You don't know what's going to happen tomorrow so adding hard [SMART goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) is unrealistic and a certain path to frustration.
They should be guidelines that help you define the direction of where do you want to go and leave to the lower abstraction level reviews particularize those principles into more specific goals. 
#### Process the captured data
So the captured data is a mix of ideas, plans, desires, objectives and principles. We need to refile them as we do with the inbox. Each element may fall or change one of the next containers:
- [A principle document](#the-principle-document): Either in the reflections or tweaking the roadmap. 
- [The life path document](#the-life-path-document).
- Project documents.
For each of them then we will:
- Think which kind of element it is
- Tweak the related documents 
- Extract the underlying principle.
- Adjust the principle document with the captured thought. 
### Trimester decide
# Year review
Year reviews are meant to give you an idea of:
- How much have you and your workflows evolved
- What roadmap decisions were right, which ones were wrong
- With the context you have now, you can think of how you could have avoided the
  bad decisions.
If you have the year's planning you can analyze it against your task management
tools and life logs and create a review document analyzing all.
The process then has many phases:
- [Housekeeping](#housekeeping)
- [Analysis](#analysis)
- [Planning](#planning)
## Housekeeping
As they are time expensive, probably lot of time may have passed since your last
life review, it's a good time to do some housekeeping tasks to have a tidy
environment (and data!) before you start analyzing everything.
- Extract all your media (photos, videos, text) from all your devices (mobiles,
  laptops, servers) to your central archive. For the portable devices I use
  [`syncthing`](syncthing.md) to sync all the important data to the
  [NAS](nas.md), although it's usually untidy.
- Once it's extracted tidy them all. For example you could group the pictures
  and videos in a tree of directories (`trips`, `trips/2022-06-Glasgow`,
  `trips/2022-06-Glasgow/2022-06-10-hiking-trail-lakes`, ...). As this is an
  unpleasant task I've created `claspy` a command line tool that helps you
  categorize the files into their desired paths. Do the same for the documents,
  music, binaries... everything! until you have an empty mobile and empty
  `Downloads` directory.
- Update [your ledger](beancount.md) so that it reflects the reality.
- Update [your task manager](task_management.md) systems so that it reflects the
  latest state.
- Update [your digital garden](digital_garden.md) so that you don't have any
  uncommited changes.
## Analysis
To do it I gather all the information from my
[life logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog) sources and start thinking
of what do I want to change. It helps me to write a markdown document with the
insights gathered in this process.
### What you have learned
It's always interesting to look back and see what you've learned throughout the
year. I have these sources of data:
- [Digital garden](#digital-garden)
- [Anki](#anki)
#### Digital garden
If you happen to have a [digital garden](digital_garden.md) you can look at your
git history to know what has changed since the last year. That's cumbersome and
ugly though, it's better to review
[your newsletters](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/newsletter/0_newsletter_index/),
although you may need to use something like
[`mkdocs-newsletter`](https://lyz-code.github.io/mkdocs-newsletter/).
While you skim through the newsletters you can add to the analysis report the
highlights of what you've learned.
You can also check
[your repository insights](git.md#get-interesting-stats-of-the-repo).
#### Anki
I use [`anki`](anki.md) to record the knowledge that I need to have in my mind.
The program has a "Stats" tab where you can see your insights of the last years
to understand how are you learning. You can also go to the "Browse" tab to sort
the cards by created and get an idea of which ones have been the most used
decks.
### What you've read
Each time I finish a book I register it in a document with a rating and
optionally a review. When doing the review I check which ones I read, which ones
I liked more, what genres have been the most popular for me, which authors. With
these data I create an analysis of what seems promising to read in the future.
I also update the section of "what you've learnt" with the insights of these
books.
### Task review
Follow the
[review process of the task management article](life_review.md#year-review).
## Planning
### What to read
With the analysis of what I've read I research for new books and create an
ordered list per genre.
