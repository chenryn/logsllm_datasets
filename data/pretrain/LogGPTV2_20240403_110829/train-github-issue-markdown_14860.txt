### Request: Access to Accumulator Image from Hough Transform

Hi,

Is there currently an option (or could one be added) to retrieve the accumulator image generated by the Hough Transform function? Having access to this intermediate result would be extremely beneficial. It would allow me to fine-tune the output based on my prior knowledge before applying any `maxloc` function to it.

Thank you.
