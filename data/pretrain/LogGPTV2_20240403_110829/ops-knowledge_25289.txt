User: I'd like to use the Python version of App Engine but rather than write my code specifically for the Google Data Store, I'd like to create my models with a generic Python ORM that could be attached to Big Table, or, if I prefer, a regular database at some later time. Is there any Python ORM such as SQLAlchemy that would allow this?
Assistant: Nowadays they do since Google has launched Cloud SQL
