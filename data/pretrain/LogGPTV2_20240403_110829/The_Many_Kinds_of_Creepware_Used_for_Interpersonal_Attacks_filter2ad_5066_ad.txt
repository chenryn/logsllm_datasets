### Money-Making and PPI Apps
We have identified several money-making applications that are similar to Pay-Per-Install (PPI) apps. We conjecture that other dropped apps were likely advertising through these PPI apps. Additionally, 23 apps create virtual machines (VMs) or modify/emulate Android, which affects the rankings by introducing devices used for antivirus (AV) testing and other atypical purposes. Through experiments described in Section VII-D, we found that eliminating 8 Android-modification apps, indicative of AV-testing, results in the disappearance of 15 additional VM apps and other None-category apps. We also experimented with eliminating both PPI and AV-test apps before running CreepRank. This approach drops both false positive (FP) None apps and true positive (TP) creepware from the top 1,000, 64% of which are creepware. These lost TPs are replaced by apps that are 85% creepware, which improves the rankings and makes them more representative of normal devices.

### Understanding the Creepware Ecosystem
The investigations thus far have uncovered a larger-than-expected ecosystem of creepware apps, including many varieties of abuse apps of which we were previously unaware. In this section, we perform a series of small analyses to better understand this ecosystem. First, we use the context in which apps are installed to infer the most probable creepware-relevant use of apps whose intent was ambiguous or unclear (Section VII-A). Next, we seed CreepRank with various seed sets to examine the extent and character of interesting subcategories within the creepware ecosystem (Section VII-B). We contrast profiles of attacker and victim devices in Section VII-C and conclude with an investigation into the role that Norton’s security app plays with respect to creepware (Section VII-D). Finally, we analyze trends in creepware over time by examining a more recent year of data in Section VII-E.

#### A. Potential Use Cases of Creepware
While coding, we hypothesized about how various types of creepware might be used. Although we lack direct usage data, app installation patterns provide circumstantial evidence about intended uses. For each category of creepware apps, we examined the context in which individual apps appear. Specifically, for each pair of creepware apps \(a\) and \(b\) that we coded, we calculated the pointwise mutual information (PMI) measure, which represents the amount of information that the existence of app \(a\) has on the appearance of app \(b\) on the same device. The PMI is given by:
\[ \text{pmi}(a; b) = \log \frac{p(a, b)}{p(a)p(b)} \]
where \(p\) is the probability function. To remove noise, we excluded PMI values for apps that co-occurred only once.

There were several instances where our initial hypotheses about the purposes of individual apps were shown to be incorrect. In some cases, coders had envisioned a malicious use for an app that was not observed in practice. More often, we discovered unsuspected malicious uses. Here are several examples of apps that we either re-categorized based on their PMI scores or that confirmed our hypotheses:

- **Lodefast Check Cashing App**: Allows users to cash checks without visiting a bank. It has high PMI values with "Card Details Finder," "Bin Checker," and "Bank Card Validator" apps, indicating that it is likely used for fraud by some users despite good intentions by its developers.
- **SMS Retaliator**: Initially coded as an anti-harassment tool due to its SMS blocking features, but PMI values indicate it is typically used alongside message-bombing and attack apps, with no signs of it appearing alongside victim-side apps.
- **Unseen - No Last Seen**: The most prevalent app for covert access to social media. It co-occurs primarily with other covert access apps and fake surveillance apps, suggesting it is sometimes used by attackers.
- **Edit Website**: Enables users to make temporary website edits. It provides a WYSIWIG editor and is routinely installed alongside spoofing, surveillance, and fake surveillance apps. Its description states, "The obvious use of this application would be to prank friends by changing headlines of news articles or paragraphs." Apps with similar functionality that advertise for web development do not seem to be used for attacks.
- **Family Locator for Android**: Many apps purporting to be for child online safety have the highest PMI with apps unambiguously intended for intimate partner surveillance. "Family Locator for Android" appears alongside abuse apps, as its previous title was "GirlFriend Cell Tracker." "Cell Tracker" is the most prevalent app with thorough surveillance capabilities, marketed for child safety, but it also correlates strongly with "Cheating Spouse," "Where the hell are you?," and "Boyfriend Tracker Free."

#### B. Finding More Creepware with Alternate Seed Sets
CreepRank can be used to surface other classes of apps. We further explored the creepware ecosystem by running CreepRank with different app seed sets.

- **Seeding with Harassment - Bomber Apps**: We selected the 7 bombing apps most confidently coded as being entirely designed for harassment. Running CreepRank with these as the seed set, we discovered 15 more bomber apps in the top 50. We found 26 more bombers in the top 1,000 by examining apps with search terms like "SMS," "bomb," "dial," "blast," "spam," "empty," and "blank."
- **Users that install bomber apps** are also likely to install apps that auto-like or auto-comment on social media, presumably to harass. Nearly all auto-liking apps self-identify as "pranks," with the exception of "404liker," which is often installed alongside malware. Several apps coded under Evasion - Steganography, because they help abusers evade censorship, are typically co-installed with bombers. These apps create large strings of text or emojis out of short messages or images, amplifying the impact of attacks.
- **Seeding with Spoof SMS apps**: To better understand how SMS spoofing apps are used, we seeded CreepRank with 18 spoofing apps and coded their intent and that of the top 50 apps. Among these 68 apps, 32 enable impersonation. Marketing materials for some of these apps suggest pernicious uses, such as damaging a victim’s relationships. Eight impersonation apps enable entire conversations to be falsified, mostly for constructing false evidence. These apps have clear parallels to phishing attacks but are under-studied.
- **Seeding with Control-Hide Icon apps**: Seeding CreepRank with nine icon-hiding apps, the top 50 results included 12 app-hiders. Some camouflaged other apps by changing icons or metadata, while others hid app icons from the user interface. Users of app-hiders frequently install apps that hide content, providing dual public and secret channels for communication. Noteworthy is "Hidden Apps," a defensive app that reveals the presence of hidden apps. The top 50 contained 9 additional defensive apps and 8 attack apps.

#### C. Characterizing Devices via Creepware
To better understand the nature of devices with creepware installed, we analyze correlations between different categories of apps co-installed on devices. For example, we hypothesize that certain apps are typically installed on devices being used by an abuser, while others are primarily installed on victim devices. Let \(Y\) be a category of apps conjectured to be indicative of a device’s role. We focus on \(Y\) being Harassment – Bombers (likely installed on the device of abusers) or Surveillance – Location apps (likely installed on the device of a victim). The tables in Table IV show the five highest and lowest app categories \(X\) for the two \(Y\) categories, where the ranking for category \(X\) is calculated as the relative difference \(\Delta_{XY} = \frac{\Pr(X|Y) - \Pr(X)}{\Pr(X)}\), where \(\Pr(X)\) is the probability of observing at least one app with category \(X\) on a device, and \(\Pr(X|Y)\) is the probability of observing at least one app with category \(X\) on a device given that the device has at least one app with category \(Y\).

As seen, harassment apps tend to be installed on the same device as other harassment apps. For \(Y\) being Surveillance – Location, the top four app categories are spyware-related, suggesting that, in some cases, it may be possible to characterize devices as attacker-owned or victim-owned based on the types of apps installed. Whether such predictions can be made accurate or useful remains an open question.

#### D. Role of the Norton Mobile Security App
By obtaining our dataset from a security vendor, we only have data from devices on which the vendor’s app is installed. We investigated if the Norton app was most often used preventatively or for post-infection cleanup. We identified 172,000 devices on which the Norton app was installed alongside one or more of the 107 thorough surveillance apps we identified. After dropping about 8,000 potentially anomalous devices, in 22,000 of the remaining 164,000 devices, the Norton app was installed after a surveillance app, suggesting post-infection cleanup. For the rest, the security app was installed before the surveillance app, suggesting preventative use. This leads us to ask why an attacker would install a security app on their device. A possible reason is that attackers frequently engage in risky behaviors, such as installing questionable or off-store apps and rooting devices, and may use the security app to guard against possible compromise.
