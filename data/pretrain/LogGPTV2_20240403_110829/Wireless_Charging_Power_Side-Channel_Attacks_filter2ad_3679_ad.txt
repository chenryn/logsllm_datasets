Below approximately 80% state of charge, both wired and wireless
charging side channels in our experiments do not leak enough
information for the classifier to identify the traces with any signifi-
cant accuracy. This is shown in Figure 10. For the wired channel,
information begins to be revealed when the battery state of charge
reaches approximately 95%. The wireless channel could consistently
classify traces with a battery state of charge as low as 90%.
Figure 10 also reveals how the power side channel through wired
charging is affected by the battery level. The variations from the
phone’s activities are visible at higher battery levels but not at lower
ones.
Previously, Yang et al.[44] found that power traces collected
at battery levels of 30% were classified with accuracy almost as
high as those collected when the battery was fully charged. The
discrepancy seems to suggest that the newer smartphones are more
resilient to power side channels. In order to further investigate how
this side channel is affected by battery levels, current traces were
collected from older Apple iPhone models, an iPhone 6s, and an
iPhone 8, and compared on the same scale. We collect the power
traces for both of these phones using the same data acquisition
setup that we used with the iPhone 11.
Wired traces collected on an iPhone 6s leaked activity at lower
battery levels than the iPhone 11 did. This can be seen in Figure 11.

state of charge as the iPhone 6s.
While the iPhone 6s does not support wireless charging, the
iPhone 8 is Qi-compatible. Its wireless current traces do not leak
any significant information when the battery level is less than or
equal to 70%. It is possible that there was a change in the hardware
design between the iPhone 8 and iPhone 11 that removed the USB
power side channel at battery levels below full charge. However,
even on the iPhone 8, little activity was revealed at the 30% battery
level compared to the Android phones studied by [44]. Additionally,
even though the iPhone 11 is not as vulnerable to USB power side-
channel attacks as the iPhone 8, both phones appear to be similarly
susceptible to the wireless charging side-channel attack at higher
battery levels.
6 OTHER ATTACK EXAMPLES
This paper demonstrates the website fingerprinting attack as an
example of a wireless power side-channel attack. However, the
wireless power side channel has the potential to leak other types
of information about activities on a mobile device that affect the
device’s power consumption. The wireless charging interface may
also introduce additional vulnerabilities beyond side-channel in-
formation leakage. For example, a malicious wireless charger may
deliver a high current as a way to damage a circuit or perform
repeated charging/discharging cycles to reduce battery life.
In this section, we discuss other side-channel attack examples
through the wireless charging power side channel with preliminary
experimental results that show their feasibility.
6.1 Estimating Passcode Length
The power consumption of a mobile device is sensitive to touch
screen inputs. We found that the wireless power side channel can
leak information about a user’s passcode. Current traces collected
during a passcode input show a momentary increase in the current
consumption for each digit of a passcode entered by tapping the
screen. Although the current surges do not directly reveal individ-
ual digits, the length of a passcode can be visually discerned from
a current trace collected during its input by counting the number
of surges it contains. Figure 12 reflects the entry of three different
passcodes of varying lengths. The entry of a digit results in signifi-
cantly more power being drawn than when the phone is at rest and
the length of each passcode can easily be identified.
Knowing a passcode’s length significantly reduces the search
space needed to crack it, especially when combined with other
information extraction attacks such as smudging attacks.
6.2 OLED Screen Power Consumption
The Google Pixel 4 in our experiments uses an OLED display, which
is a type of display in which light is emitted by individual diodes
and not by a backlight. This type of display generally consumes
less power because individual pixels only light up if required by
the screen content.
Using the wireless charging power side channel, we found that
the current draw of the phone directly correlates with the number
of white pixels on the screen. To measure the power consumption
as a function of the number of white pixels, a completely black

there is an incoming call.
6.3 Audio Fingerprinting
The previous subsections show that the wireless power side channel
can leak user interface (UI) activities, especially from the variation
in the screen power consumption. Here, we use an audio finger-
printing attack to demonstrate that the wireless power side channel
can also leak background activities.

Figure 14: The current trace that demonstrates distinction
between idle time and repeated square/multiply operations.
In this attack, we use the classification algorithm from the web-
site fingerprinting attack to perform a fingerprinting attack on an
audio track that was playing on the Pixel 4. With the phone screen
off, we automated the phone to play 10 locally stored audio files
from the LJ Speech Dataset [19] in a round-robin fashion. We then
formed training, validation, and testing data sets that were used to
determine which audio track was playing at the time each current
trace was recorded. The full results of this experiment can be found
in Table 6.
This attack demonstrates that even with the phone screen off,
the activities on the phone can produce consistent and detectable
features in the wireless power side channel. This wireless charging
attack represents a serious privacy risk as it may allow the content
of a conversation or media being played to be identified even if a
user does not explicitly plug in a phone to a charger.
6.4 Attacks on Cryptographic Algorithms
The power side-channel attacks on cryptographic algorithms such
as RSA are widely studied and demonstrated in the context of a
wired power supply. As we found that the power side channel
through wireless charging is comparable to the wired power side
channel for other attacks, we believe that the wireless power side-
channel attacks will be feasible for cryptographic algorithms. Un-
fortunately, our experimental setup based on a microcontroller can
only sample the power consumption every 1.4ms, which is not
enough to perform a full attack on fast cryptographic algorithms.
A high-end oscilloscope will be able to provide more fine-grained
measurements of power consumption. As a proof-of-concept ex-
periment, Figure 14 shows that the wireless power side channel
can distinguish periods where a CPU is idle vs. repeatedly running
either square or multiply operations.
7 DISCUSSIONS
7.1 Wireless vs. Wired Charging
This paper investigates the information leakage arising from the
power side channel in wireless charging, using the website finger-
printing attack as a primary example. Even though a power side
channel also exists in wired charging, wireless charging introduces
vulnerability to attacks that would be impractical or even impos-
sible through wired charging. In wired charging, a user needs to
deliberately initiate charging by plugging a cable into a phone.
On the other hand, wireless charging can initiate without a user’s
deliberate actions or knowledge. If a phone is placed on a surface
that contains a compatible wireless charger, then the charging
process begins immediately. Wireless chargers can already be found
in cars, cafes, hotels, airports, and furniture. A wireless charger
could be hidden by being embedded in a surface upon which there
is no symbol identifying it. In this situation, a user could place their
phone on this surface, unintentionally charging it. In this sense,
wireless charging can expose background computations to side-
channel attacks. If the victim uses their phone without noticing it
charging, foreground activity can also be exposed.
Wireless charging works over small distances or through thin
surfaces. Therefore, if a phone is in a pocket or bag and a wireless
charger is embedded in a seat or chair, then a charging connection
could be initiated unbeknownst to an owner.
7.2 Other Use Cases of Wireless Charging Side
Channel
Previous studies [10, 28] discussed how traditional power side chan-
nels may be used to detect malicious software on embedded devices.
Similarly, the wireless charging interface may also be leveraged as
a way to check the integrity of small mobile or embedded devices
without physical connectors, such as a smartwatch. For such appli-
cation scenarios, we will need further studies to see if the resolution
and the accuracy of the power monitoring through wireless charg-
ing are sufficient to detect software changes or malicious activities
on an embedded device.
7.3 Countermeasures
While it enables attacks without a physical connection, the wire-
less charging side-channel attack is still based on the same secret-
dependent variations in the device’s power consumption that tradi-
tional power side-channel attacks exploit. In that sense, the exist-
ing countermeasures against power side-channel attacks can also
prevent the wireless charging side-channel attack. For example,
Pothukuchi et al. [30] show that the power dissipated by a com-
puter can be reshaped to obfuscate the fingerprint left by a running
application. Matovu et al. [26] present both software and hard-
ware solutions as defense mechanisms against malicious charging
stations. Yan et al. [42] suggest energy obfuscation through code
injection, which would embed meaningless code in applications
to make features in the power trace be less predictable. Similarly,
Spreitzer et al. [38] propose execution randomization as a defense
mechanism against power analysis attacks. A variety of methods
exist to insert random noise into a power trace or obscure sensitive
information by making adjustments at the cell level [29]. Cronin
Session 3A: Side Channel CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea662et al. [11] found that applying a low-pass filter with a cutoff of
60 Hz to collected power trace data reduced the accuracy of their
passcode-cracking attack to that of a random guess.
To further reduce the amount of information leaked through
wireless charging, we may be able to augment the charging algo-
rithm to avoid fully charging the battery at less trusted locations.
Previously, Zhang et al. [46] proposed a WirelessID, a system for fin-
gerprinting individual wireless chargers and identifying potential
wireless charging attacks.
Currently, iPhones running iOS 13 or later employ Optimized
Battery Charging, a charging algorithm that reduces the amount of
time an iPhone spends fully charged to preserve its battery lifespan.
This feature uses location data to determine whether or not to delay
charging past 80% [4]. If this algorithm could be adjusted to also
engage when the iPhone is connected to an untrusted charger, then
the battery would never leave the constant current Li-ion charging
stage as seen in Figure 6. Our results show that minimal information
would leak to the charger at these lower battery levels because the
same amount of maximum current will be delivered to the battery
regardless of the process currently executing.
8 RELATED WORK
Power analysis attacks are a well-established field of research and
a variety have been studied in mobile devices. Spreitzer et al. [38]
presented a thorough categorization system and survey of existing
side-channel attacks, especially those applicable to mobile devices
and Liu et al. [24] and Yan et al. [42] presented a survey of side-
channel attacks on USB powered devices that relate to exploiting a
USB connection. Clark et al. [9] found that a computer plugged into
a wall was susceptible to an SPA attack and used AC power traces
to carry out a website fingerprinting attack. While we build upon
the existing body of power side-channel and website fingerprinting
attacks to demonstrate a vulnerability, our work is the first to
identify a wireless charging side channel that utilizes completely
different circuitry than that of wired charging.
Genkin et al. [13] extracted ECDSA keys from a wired USB
power charging side channel and also from an EM channel with
a Qi charging coil as a probe. Spolaor et al. [37] showed that a
malicious charging station could use a USB charging connection to
exfiltrate sensitive smartphone data even when no user permissions
are granted. While we also use the USB power side channel to
perform attacks, we examine the wireless side channel directly
via the built-in Qi-wireless charging capabilities of the phones.
Additionally, we measure the current being delivered to the charger,
not the physical emanations or data on the phone itself.
Yang et al. [44] determined that even when none of a smart-
phone’s data pins are connected, a USB power station can still
identify specific activity occurring on the phone. Cronin et al. [11]
demonstrate that USB power traces from smartphones leak infor-
mation about the contents of a device’s touch screen. While we also
examine this charging power side channel in our attack, our work
