User: I'm looking for a Python IDE that can help me easily locate and manage and use the libraries on my system (Ubuntu).  Specifically Twisted.
Code completion is important including the symbols I import.
(I've so far had a look at PyDev as well as OpenKomodo, but while both offer code completion for default Python concepts, I wasn't able to get either to import Twisted into my project and was thus getting reference errors.)
Usual disclaimer: I don't like EMACS or vi, please, nothing regarding those.
Assistant: eclipse + pydev seems to work well for me.
Just remember to right-click on the project and select Properties and make sure that your libraries are on the path. Sometimes this doesn't happen for easy_installed libraries.
