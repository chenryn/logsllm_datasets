User: I am considering purchasing an imac with the thought of dual-purposing the machine. I'd like to use it as a home computer, but also host a personal website or two using OSX Server.
By using my computer as a server, is there any way that a malicious attack through my website can allow someone access to files that are stored locally on my hard drive? Is it safer to simply use a dedicated machine or service?
NB: I hope that a question regarding website security is appropriate, sorry that this isn't explicitly a coding question.
Assistant: Yes of course it's absolutely possible. Depending on the services you are running, you will always be adding more potential holes for an attacker to find.
