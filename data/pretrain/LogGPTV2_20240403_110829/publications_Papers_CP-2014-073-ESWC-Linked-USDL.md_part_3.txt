USDL does not currently provide support for capturing how providers deliver
services in terms of resources needed, complex internal workflows, or strategic
decisions (e.g., targeted markets). The reason for this is two-fold. First, such
aspects are often not automated and when they are, providers already have
mechanisms in place to this end. Second, these are private concerns that are
orthogonaltothetradingofservices.Similarly,LinkedUSDLdoesnotcurrently
include support for conceptualising complex agreementsincluding legal require-
mentsandguaranteesasthese werebarelyusedorunderstoodbyusers.Finally,
we haveoptedfor a simple mechanismforcapturing prices andhavedeferredto
a separate module the modelling of more complex dynamic pricing that are less
often used and usually remain private to the provider.

Despite these changes, Linked USDL provides advanced support for mod-
elling, comparing, discovering, and trading services and service bundles. It pro-
vides means for trackingand reasoningabout the involvementof entities within
deliverychainswhichinformsthetradingandcomparisonofservicesaswellasit
enables the tracing and analysis of service value networks. It provides advanced
support for automating the interactions between actors during the life-cycle of
services.Additionallyitincludessupportforcapturingserviceofferings,forcom-
bining services and products (e.g., a car often comes with a warranty), and for
applying temporal reasoning, which were not previously available. Finally, and
most importantly, these activities can be achieved with a greater level of au-
tomationbenefitting fromautomatedreasoningandtheycanbe performedona
Web-scale across Web-sites and service providers thanks to capturing and shar-
ing the semantics of services as Linked Data.
Empirically, the suitability of the language for supporting the automation of
key tasks has been evaluated by two main means. On the one hand, we have
reused and developed tools that provide support for these tasks, and, on the
otherhand,wearecontinuouslyapplyingLinkedUSDLinanumberofdomains.
In terms of reuse, thanks to the adoption of existing Linked Data vocabularies,
Linked USDL benefits from general purpose tooling, e.g., SPARQL engines and
RDF stores, but also from vocabulary-specific solutions. This notably concerns
existing advancedmachinery for discovering,composing, and invokingtechnical
services (i.e., RESTful and WSDL services) described in terms of MSM [18].
Additionally, general purpose infrastructure has been developed specifically
for Linked USDL. A Web-based Linked USDL editor is currently available to
help providers to easily generate Linked USDL descriptions12. There is also an
advancedmulti-partydynamic andopenservicemarketplace13 developedinthe
context of the FI-WARE project14, able to gather, combine, and exploit rich
service descriptionsfrom distributed providersto help match offer and demand.
Notably the marketplace supports consumers in searching for service offerings,
comparing them, and contracting them.
Finally, from the perspective of its suitability for supporting service trad-
ing across domains, Linked USDL is currently being applied in a variety of
domains. For instance, in the field of Software as a Service we have explored
the use of Linked USDL in conjunction with TOSCA[21]. Linked USDL was
used to formalise, structure, and simplify the discoveryand selection of services
of the Web-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform Sugar-
CRM, while TOSCA supported the automated deployment and management
of the services. Additionally this work helped us evaluate the extensibility of
Linked USDL by integrating it with complementary third party specifications
such as TOSCA. In the FI-WARE project Linked USDL is used to support a
service infrastructure supporting service ecosystems in the cloud covering both

the technical andbusiness perspectives. The FINEST15 projectaims to support
the transport and logistics (T&L) ecosystem, in which many service providers
collaborate in order to transport goods over what is referred to as a “chain of
legs”. Therein Linked USDL is being exploited in the planning of chains of legs
to support searching and matching transport service offerings in a transparent,
distributed, and multi-party manner.
Across the diverse domains where Linked USDL is being applied (see list of
projects next), it has proven to be a valuable resource as a means to provide
sharedandgloballyaccessibleservicedescriptionsintegratingbothtechnicaland
business aspects. The genericity, modularity, and extensibility of the approach
has enabled extending the vocabulary with dedicated domain-specific vocabu-
laries in the areas of SaaS and T&L, while generic software infrastructure was
easily reused across domains.
5.3 Vocabulary Adoption and Use
When evaluating ontologies and vocabularies, one aspect that is often taken
into account is their adoption and use. This evaluation may be carried over
the ontology itself and/or over the different ontologies that are imported. The
former gives an indication of the acceptance and adoption of the ontology in
its entirety whereas the latter provides a more granular assessment over the
reused ontologies. In this section we mainly address the latter but also provide
preliminary indications of the overall adoption of Linked USDL.
The methodologythatwasfollowed,seeSection4.2,wascentredonthe reuse
ofwidelyadoptedvocabularies.Table1presentedearliershowsthemainvocab-
ulariesthatwereidentifiedthroughsearchengines,togetherwithcoreindicators
of their use on the Web. These figures highlight that Linked USDL is based on
vocabulariesthatarethemostusedintheirrespectivedomainsofinterest.Only
two exceptions exist, AKT Signage which was not adopted for it was not deref-
erenceable,andSchema.orgwhichisindirectlyalignedviaGR.Thisapproachin
turn reduces the potential overhead one would incur when using Linked USDL:
frequentlyreusedvocabulariesarelikelytohavegreateracceptanceandsupport
by people and existing systems.
Additionally,theavailabilityofdatasetswithinstancesintermsofthevocab-
ularies reused guarantees that new descriptions could reuse and link to existing
resources,e.g.,allowingthereuseofdescriptionsofcompanies.Doingsoprovides
clearbenefitsfromtheperspectiveofdataacquisitionwhichwasoneofthemain
concerns Linked USDL was trying to address. Additionally, by linking to exist-
ing instances the data provided is enriched which may in turn enable further
advanced processing as well as it may increase the discoverability of services.
Providing a substantial account of the adoption of Linked USDL would re-
quire a reasonable wait from its first release, which coincides with this pub-
lication. Nonetheless, Linked USDL is currently already in use within more
than 10 research projects, namely FI-WARE, FINEST, Value4Cloud, Deutsche

LinkedUSDL 81
Digitale Bibliothek, MSEE, FIspace, FITMAN, FI-CONTENT, ENVIROFI,
OUTSMART, SMARTAGRIFOOD, IoT-A, Broker@Cloud, and GEYSERS.
These projects are using Linked USDL as the core vocabulary for describing
services, contributing to validate the suitability, genericity, and extensibility of
Linked USDL for different domains. This also highlights that despite its youth,
Linked USDL is already witnessing a promising adoption.
6 Conclusion
Despitetheimportanceofservicesindevelopedeconomies,thewidespreadadop-
tionofworld-wideelectroniccommerceovertheWeb,mostservicetradingisstill
essentially carried out via traditional and often manual communication means.
A fundamental reason for this is the difficulty for capturing the abundant in-
formation and knowledge governing services and their related transactions in a
way amenable to computer automation. Out of the wealth of work around ser-
vices, USDL is the most comprehensive solution proposed thus far for enabling
(semi)automated service trading. Yet, work on its standardisationhighlighted a
number of limitations for Web-scale service trading.

Further work is required for covering aspects such as complex dynamic pricing
models and agreements which are common in certain domains such as Cloud
services. Additionally, from the tooling perspective, developing advanced mech-
anisms able to support steps such as the negotiation between service providers
and consumers, or the bundling of services would also be necessary. We expect
in this last regard to take inspiration and adapt solutions developed for the e3
family of ontologies.
