User: Install and configure an Nginx-based reverse proxy server
Assistant: 1. Install Nginx If you are using a Linux system (such as Ubuntu, Debian or CentOS), you can use the following command to install Nginx: Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx CentOS: sudo yum update sudo yum install nginx 2. Configure the reverse proxy Open the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, find the server part and add a location block in it, as follows: server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } The above configuration will proxy all requests from example.com to local port 8080. According to different needs, multiple location blocks can be added to implement functions such as routing forwarding and distribution. 3. Restart Nginx After the installation is complete and the configuration is complete, Nginx needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect. Ubuntu/Debian: sudo service nginx restart CentOS: sudo systemctl restart nginx 4. Test You have now successfully configured an Nginx-based reverse proxy server. You can test that it works by visiting example.com with your browser and seeing if it returns the expected results normally.
