### Title: Detecting Fake 4G Base Stations in Real Time

**Abstract:**

4G/LTE IMSI-catchers, such as the Hailstorm, are becoming increasingly popular among governments, law enforcement agencies, spies, and even criminals. While much of the focus on IMSI-catcher detection has historically centered on 2G devices like the Stingray, these older models are rapidly falling out of favor. In this presentation, we aim to dispel common misconceptions about the capabilities and limitations of modern IMSI-catchers, drawing on recent research in cellular network security.

We will demonstrate software and heuristic methods for detecting fake 4G/LTE base stations, which can be implemented by anyone. Additionally, we will outline a roadmap for addressing some of the fundamental security issues in cellular networks, with the ultimate goal of rendering IMSI-catchers obsolete.

**Key Points:**
- **Increasing Popularity of 4G/LTE IMSI-Catchers:** Overview of the growing use of 4G/LTE IMSI-catchers by various entities.
- **Myths and Realities:** Clarification of what modern IMSI-catchers can and cannot do, based on recent research findings.
- **Detection Methods:** Demonstration of software and heuristics for identifying fake 4G/LTE base stations.
- **Future Security Improvements:** A proposed plan for enhancing cellular network security to eliminate the threat posed by IMSI-catchers.

This talk aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of IMSI-catcher technology and offer practical solutions for real-time detection and future security enhancements.
