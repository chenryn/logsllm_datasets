User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to detect suspicious activity on a web and mailserver? There is a OpenBSD (64bit; 5.5) server having nginx (HTTP/HTTPS) and SMTP (OpenSMTP). 

Question: What are the best practices to detect suspicious activity? Are there any scripts that shows interesting activity from the logs or somewhere? Attacks, DDOS, any abnormal activity?  

Example for detecting IP addresses that connected too many times: dos.awk

function max(arr, big) {
    big = 0;
    for (i in cat) {
    if (cat[i] &gt; big) { big=cat[i]; }
    }
    return big
}

NF &gt; 0 {
    cat[$1]++;
}
END {
    maxm = max(cat);
    for (i in cat) {
    scaled = 60 * cat[i] / maxm;
    printf "%-25.25s  [%8d]:", i, cat[i]
    for (i=0; i&lt;scaled; i++) {
        printf "#";
    }
    printf "\n";
    }
}


How to use it: 

tail -n 1000 /var/www/logs/access.log | awk -f dos.awk | sort -nrk3 | less

Assistant: There are a number of ways you could approach this, but the most direct would probably be to set up an intrusion detection system, such as Snort.  It monitors all traffic to the server and can warn you of suspicious activity.
