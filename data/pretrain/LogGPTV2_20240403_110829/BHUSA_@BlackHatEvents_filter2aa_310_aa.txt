### Introduction

Wireless communication systems, including those that use Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology, are vulnerable to various security threats that can compromise their reliability and impact production operations.

#### UWB Technology
- **Ideal for short-range devices**: UWB can transmit information quickly over short distances.
- **Penetration through solid objects**: UWB signals can pass through walls and other barriers.
- **Preferred protocol for RTLS**: UWB is the preferred communication protocol for Real-Time Locating Systems (RTLS).

#### RTLS Components
- **Tags**: Devices attached to the objects or people being tracked.
- **Anchors**: Fixed reference points that receive signals from the tags.
- **Server**: Computes, displays, and stores the positions of the tags based on the time of arrival of the UWB signals.

### Cyber Threats

Wireless networks, especially those used in critical applications, are susceptible to attacks by cyber criminals who aim to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data or disrupt operations.

---

### Motivation

According to the FiRa Consortium, there was an increased demand in 2018 for "improvements to existing modulations to increase the integrity and accuracy of ranging measurements." This motivated our research into how threat actors can exploit these vulnerabilities and disrupt environments using UWB RTLS.

- **IEEE Standard 802.15.4**: Released in 2020.
- **IEEE 802.15.4z Amendment**: Also released in 2020.
- **Out-of-Scope Considerations**: Synchronization and exchange of location data are considered out-of-scope by the standard, leaving these critical aspects to vendor discretion.
- **Research Gap**: There has been no prior research focusing specifically on this problem.

---

### Scope

#### Industry Scope
- **Target Sectors**: Industrial and healthcare.
- **Critical Applications**: Employee and patient tracking, geofencing, and contact tracing.

#### Analyzed Solutions
- **Sewio Indoor Tracking RTLS UWB Wi-Fi Kit**
- **Avalue Renity Artemis Enterprise Kit**
  - Both kits include tags, anchors, and server software providing safety features.

#### Technical Scope
- **Network Communications**:
  - **UWB**: Tags to anchors, anchors to anchors.
  - **Ethernet/Wi-Fi/Other**: Anchors to RTLS server.
  - A flaw in any part of this chain can compromise the entire infrastructure.
- **Focus of Research**: Analysis of Ethernet/Wi-Fi communications, which has not been previously studied.

### TDoA Background and Theory

In a TDoA RTLS, two types of packets are exchanged among anchors and the server:

#### Packet Taxonomy
- **Synchronization Packets**: Used to synchronize the clocks of the anchors.
- **Positioning Packets**: Used to determine the position of a tag based on the time of arrival of UWB signals.

#### Algorithm Details
- **Clock Synchronization**: Converts all anchors' timestamps to a common clock domain using the Linear Interpolation algorithm.
- **Position Estimation**: Uses the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) to estimate the position of the tag.

**All details are available in our whitepaper. Download it from the briefing page or the Nozomi Networks website.**

### Reverse Engineering of Network Traffic

- **Custom Protocols**: Both solutions use custom, unknown binary network protocols for communications between anchors and the server.
- **Packet Dissection**: By reverse engineering the server software, we reconstructed the full packet structure.

**PCAPs and dissectors for both Sewio and Avalue RTLS are freely available. Download them from the briefing page or GitHub.**

---

### Security Considerations

- **Confidentiality**: No confidentiality measures in anchor-server communications; timestamps are sent in cleartext.
- **Integrity**: No secure integrity mechanisms; Sewio RTLS uses CRC-16, and Avalue RTLS performs a byte-by-byte sum of all packets.

---

### Anchor Coordinates Prerequisite

Obtaining anchor coordinates is challenging as they are manually input during installation and not transmitted over the network.

- **Attacker with Physical Access**: Can estimate coordinates by measuring power levels of wireless signals.
- **Attacker with Remote Access**: Can compute metrics like First Path Power Level (FPPL) from the power level information in the packets.

**For more detailed information, refer to the whitepaper.**
