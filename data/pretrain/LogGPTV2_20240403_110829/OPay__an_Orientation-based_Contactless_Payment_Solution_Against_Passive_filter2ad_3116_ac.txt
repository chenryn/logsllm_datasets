card-board is placed in a bag and when it is in a pocket. Fig. 6 b and

The same experiment was repeated five times. The recorded sensor

4.3 Performance
Error rates: as discussed in Section 3.5, we use FAR and FRR to
evaluate the performance of OPay. Fig. 7 shows the FRR and FAR
results with reference to a threshold angle of varying degrees. For
the targeted guessing attack, the equal error rate (EER) where the
FRR and FAR curves intersect is 12%. For the random guessing at-
tack, the EER is only 1%. As an example, if we choose θ = 5° as the
threshold, we have FRR = 4.76%. For the targeted guessing attack,
FAR = 15.24%, and for the random guessing attack, FAR = 0.96%.
This result is encouraging as it shows that we can substantially
reduce the attack success rate from the current 100% to about 1-15%
(that is a reduction by 85-99%). Hence, the attacker must make
multiple tries, which will significantly increase the chance of detec-
tion by the issuer bank, which will in turn inform the user, e.g., by
sending an SMS or a notification on the user’s phone. The 4.76%
false rejection rate is reasonably small. On average, the user will
need to make 1/(1 − 4.76%) = 1.05 attempts to make a successful
payment. This is hardly an inconvenience. In real-life contactless
payment transactions, a cardholder is occasionally declined at the
first attempt and needs to make a second attempt for the payment
due to various reasons, e.g., distorted signals or interference with
other nearby cards or NFC devices [11].
Timing: In terms of timing, our orientation detection requires
collecting 5 samples of quaternions to derive the orientation of the
device. It takes only 0.132 seconds to read data from the accelerom-
eter and gyroscope sensors as shown in Table 2. The remaining
operations involve fusing the accelerometer and gyroscope mea-
surements and calculating the orientation, which takes 0.082 and
0.014 seconds respectively. Overall, the total duration is 0.228 sec-
onds. From the user feedback, participants in our user study gener-
ally do not feel a difference in latency from a normal transaction.
We note that providing a fast payment experience is important, and
EMV requires a contactless payment to be completed within 0.5
seconds.
4.4 Usability
After the experiments, we conducted an anonymous survey using
a questionnaire. In the questionnaire, we asked our participants to
rate both the normal contactless payment scenario and the OPay
contactless payment scenario in terms of usability. We adopted
a widely used System Usability Scale (SUS) framework to assess
the user’s satisfaction with usability [3]. The SUS questionnaire
contains ten questions. The answer to each question scales from 1
to 5 (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). Table 3 shows the
SUS questions along with the scores for both payment methods.
The overall SUS score for the normal contactless payment scenario
(without OPay) is 83. The score for the OPay contactless payment
system is 78.62. The slight drop in the SUS score is mainly because
the proof-of-concept prototype of the sensor-enabled card uses
an Arduino board and is bulkier than a normal bank card. One

user commented: “The prototype boards are heavy and there are
jumpers on it that make it difficult”. Another user also commented:
“I find it difficult for people with certain conditions, like people with
Parkinson’s, or old people with shaking hands.” Nonetheless, we
are still encouraged by the SUS score of 78.62, which shows the
user’s general satisfaction with our prototype. We expect the SUS
score will increase if the implementation of the card prototype can
be made more compact.
In OPay, users make a contactless payment naturally as normal.
The measurement of the motion sensor data is transparent and
seamlessly integrated into the payment process. All these make
users feel that the OPay system is as fast as a normal payment. A
user commented: “To me, it is not different compared to the standard
contactless payment scenario.” The normal payment usage model
is preserved as no additional action is required.
In the questionnaire, we also ask users the frequency of using
contactless payments in real life, among the choices of “always”,
“frequently”, “sometimes” and “seldom”. The majority of the partic-
ipants (55%) chose “always”, and 30% chose “frequently”. Overall,
most participants have had experience with using contactless pay-
ment (see Fig. 8a). By using the Spearman correlation method, we
find a positive correlation between the OPay SUS score with the
participant’s previous experience of using contactless (see Fig.e 8b),
i.e., the more experience of using contactless payment, the higher
the SUS score (Spearman correlation coefficient ρ = 0.301 and two-
tailed p < 0.0001). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 8b, there is also a
positive correlation between the SUS score for a normal contactless
payment system and the frequency of the usage (ρ = 0.285 and
p < 0.0001).

payment usage and correlation with SUS scores
5 RELATED WORK
Contactless payment is one application of the NFC technology for
making an electronic payment. Other NFC applications include con-
tactless access cards, keyless doors, keyless entry cars, etc. Passive
relay (PR) attack is a common threat to all these systems. Solutions
proposed in the past can be generally divided into three categories:
based on 1) distance bounding; 2) user activation and 3) ambient
environment. For the specific contactless payment application dis-
cussed in this paper, we focus on reviewing solutions in the last two
categories. It is well known that distance bounding protocols are
extremely sensitive to processing delays [27]. More efficient proto-
cols apply symmetric cryptography, but require the two devices to
have a pre-shared secret key. This is not applicable in our scenario
since the card and the payment terminal have no pre-shared secret.
Furthermore, in an MP attack, the card and the terminal are already
in close distance. Hence, distance bounding is not applicable here.
User activation. This category of solutions involves an ex-
plicit user action to activate the payment process. For example,
Mehrnezhad et al. [23] proposed a “Tap-Tap and Pay” (TTP) so-
lution, in which a user initiates an NFC payment by physically
tapping their payment device against the reader twice in succession
to start the payment process. Czeskis et al. [5] require the user to
perform a specific gesture (e.g. alpha, key/hip twist, single/double
circle, and triangle) with their card to activate an authentication
process. Their solution is designed for RFID access cards, but it
can also be applied to prevent relay attacks in contactless payment.
Gurulian et al. [16] require the user to press buttons on the user’s
payment device to activate a contactless payment process. All these
solutions can prevent PR attacks and MP attacks since an explicit
user action is required. However, this changes the existing usage
model in contactless payments.
Ambient environment. This category of solutions uses sensors
to measure the ambient environment to make sure the card and the
reader are in the same environment or the same location. Halevi
et al. [18] proposed to measure the audio and light in the ambient
environment. Ma et al.[22] proposed to use the GPS data to ensure
the card and the reader are in the same location. Shrestha et al. [25]
proposed to measure the ambient environment using a range of
sensors, including temperature (T), gas (G), humidity (H), and alti-
tude (A). They further proposed to combine the sensors to improve
results, e.g., GA which combines gas and altitude. Other combina-
tions include HGA and THGA. Instead of measuring the natural
environment, Gurulian et al. [15] proposed to use infrared light to
create an artificial ambient environment (AAE) and the infrared
sensor to measure the environment. In a follow-up work [17], they
proposed a similar solution of using vibration as an alternative
AAE and six AAE sensors (accelerometer, gravity, gyroscope, linear
acceleration, magnetic field, and rotation vector) to measure the
surrounding environment.
While these ambient-sensors-based solutions can detect PR at-
tacks when the card and remote terminal are located in two distinct
environments, they have two limitations. First, the ambient environ-
ment is not a secret and can be easily manipulated as demonstrated
by Truong et al. [30]. In an MP attack, the attacker has the freedom
to manipulate the sounding environment of the mPoS device. For
example, if the victim’s card is kept in a bag and a light sensor is
