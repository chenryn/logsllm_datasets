ABSTRACT
Online social networking sites (OSNs) like Facebook and
Orkut contain personal data of millions of users. Many
OSNs view this data as a valuable asset that is at the core of
their business model. Both OSN users and OSNs have strong
incentives to restrict large scale crawls of this data. OSN
users want to protect their privacy and OSNs their business
interest. Traditional defenses against crawlers involve rate-
limiting browsing activity per user account. These defense
schemes, however, are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where a
crawler creates a large number of fake user accounts. In this
paper, we propose Genie, a system that can be deployed by
OSN operators to defend against Sybil crawlers. Genie is
based on a simple yet powerful insight: the social network
itself can be leveraged to defend against Sybil crawlers. We
ﬁrst present Genie’s design and then discuss how Genie can
limit crawlers while allowing browsing of user proﬁles by
normal users.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Online social networking sites (OSNs), such as Facebook,
Twitter, and Orkut, contain data about millions of users.
These OSNs allow users to browse the proﬁle of other users
in the network, making it easy for users to connect, commu-
nicate and share content. This core functionality of OSNs,
however, can be exploited by crawlers to aggregate data
about large numbers of OSN users for re-publication [1] or
other more nefarious purposes [2] that violate users’ privacy.

Crawlers present a signiﬁcant problem not only for OSN
users but also for OSN site operators. First, many OSNs
view the user data as a valuable asset that could be leveraged
to generate revenue in the future, for example, via targeted
advertisements. So OSNs have an incentive to prevent third
party crawlers from accessing their data. Second, while OSN
operators can ensure that data is used according to privacy
policies speciﬁed on their sites, they cannot make any guar-
antees about how crawlers will use that data. A third party
that crawls an OSN can do anything with that data (e.g. re-
publish the data or infer private information [2]). Yet, if the
third party crawler does something nefarious, the OSN op-
erator is likely to be held responsible, at least in the court of
public opinion. For example, Facebook was widely blamed
in the popular press for allowing a crawler to gather public
proﬁles of a large number of users [1].
Today OSN operators employ various rate-limiting tech-
niques to restrict a crawler’s ability to scrape the network.
These techniques typically rely on limiting the number of
user proﬁles a single user account or IP address can view
in a given period of time [4]. Unfortunately, these schemes
can be easily circumvented by a Sybil attack, in which the
crawler creates a large number of fake user accounts and/or
hires a botnet to gain access to multiple IP addresses.
In this work, we propose Genie, a system that OSN op-
erators can deploy to limit Sybil crawlers. Genie relies on a
key assumption about OSNs, namely, that it would be hard
for crawlers to establish an arbitrarily large number of links
to users in an OSN. Intuitively, this assumption is based on
the observation that forming a new link between two users
requires a certain amount of familiarity between the users
involved. Genie leverages this insight to limit large scale
crawls. It ties the ability of a user to crawl the OSN to the
number of links she establishes with the rest of the network.
2. GENIE DESIGN
At its core, Genie models the trust between nodes in a social
network as a credit network [3] and leverages this network
to ensure crawlers cannot collect additional information by
creating many identities. Speciﬁcally, Genie maps the nodes
and links in the OSN to nodes and edges in a credit net-
work. Each edge in the credit network is assigned some ini-
tial credit that is refreshed periodically. User A is allowed
to view the proﬁle of user B only if there exists a path in the
credit network that connects the two users and has suﬃcient
398of ordinary users, many of whom make their personal data
accessible to the public, under the implicit (though incor-
rect) assumption that their data would not be viewed by
the whole world. There is a subtle but important diﬀerence
between data being accessible to the public at large and data
being viewed by the public at large. Thus, we argue that the
limit Genie imposes on the number of views a user’s data
might receive, even as the data is accessible to the public at
large, might be a desirable side-eﬀect.
On the other hand, certain users, such as politicians,
celebrities, and marketeers, might not want the proﬁle views
that they receive to be limited by Genie. We would argue
that these users would in any case have many friend links,
which would naturally allow more views. A side-eﬀect of
this approach is that a celebrity would be able to crawl a
large number of users. But it is hard to imagine a celebrity
behaving like a Sybil crawler. Some of these celebrities may
further desire that their proﬁle could be viewed by every-
one without any limits. OSN sites can accommodate such
users by explicitly allowing them to keep some or all of their
proﬁle contents outside the Genie framework. Access to the
content would not be moderated by Genie and the content
would not be protected from aggregation by crawlers.
Does Genie introduce new DDoS attacks? If Genie
is deployed it may be feasible for a group of OSN users to
launch a DDoS attack against a speciﬁc user A or against
a small group of users. They can visit user A’s proﬁle re-
peatedly, exhaust credit on A’s incoming links, and thus,
block further access to A’s proﬁle for everybody, including
A’s friends. Genie solves this problem by allowing user A
to create a whitelist of users (e.g., all direct friends of A),
who would be granted access to A’s proﬁle regardless of the
availability of credit. This ensures that the user A’s proﬁle
data is always available to her direct friends.
3. DEPLOYMENT CHALLENGES
The primary challenge that OSN operators will face when
deploying Genie lies in managing liquidity (i.e., credits) in
the network. The OSN must decide upon the pricing model,
the amount of credit value that is initially assigned to the
directed edges of the OSN, and the rate at which credit
is refreshed. The credits should be managed such that it
would allow normal user browsing activities, while limiting
the crawler or data aggregator activities. If an OSN assigns
too much credit, it would allow too much of the undesired
crawling activity. But, if it assigns too little then it could
aﬀect normal browsing activities of users.
We are currently investigating methods to determine suit-
able credit values by analyzing past user behavior. We are
experimenting with diﬀerent settings and have some promis-
ing preliminary results. We are still in the process of com-
pleting a thorough evaluation of the system. For more de-

Figure 1: Genie represents the social network as a

rest of the network are shown with bold dotted lines.
credit on each link along the path. If no such path exists,
then user A is blocked from browsing the data of user B.
Figure 1 illustrates how Genie represents the social net-
work as a credit network consisting of directed links and
leverages the credit network to determine which proﬁle vis-
its are allowed. For example, in the ﬁgure, Genie allows user
A to visit the proﬁle for user C because there exists a di-
rected path from A to C with every edge on the path having
a credit value of at least one. Once A visits C’s proﬁle, the
credit on each directed edge in the selected path is decre-
mented by one. User A, on the other hand, is not allowed
to visit the proﬁle for user E because there is no path from
A to E in which all edges have suﬃcient credit to support
the proﬁle visit.
In the above example, we focussed on a pricing model
that deducts one unit of credit from each edge along the
path from A to C. We note, however, that there exist diﬀer-
ent pricing models that bound the ability of users to browse
other users’ proﬁles to diﬀerent extents. While the pricing
model that best suits an OSN depends on the OSN’s work-
load (i.e., users’ browsing behavior) and the OSN’s social
graph, Genie ensures that the following property holds for
any valid pricing scheme: Given any cut through the social
network graph, the rate of proﬁle view requests between nodes
on diﬀerent sides of the cut is proportional to the number of
edges in the cut. Thus with Genie, the ability of a user to
crawl the OSN is tied to and limited by the number of social
links she establishes with the rest of the network. Coupled
with the observation that it is hard for crawlers to establish
arbitrarily large number of links to other OSN users, this
suggests that, even when a crawler creates a large number
of Sybil identities, her ability to crawl the network would be
limited.
We illustrate this situation in Figure 1 where crawler X
creates three Sybil identities: X1, X2 and X3. However,
these Sybil identities do not give the crawler any extra ben-
eﬁt since the available credit on the cut between the crawler
nodes and the rest of the network remains the same. Thus
the crawlers, having a limited number of links to the rest
of the network, would be allowed to perform only a limited
number of crawls.
While the basic operation of Genie is straightforward,
there are a few obvious points of concern:
Does Genie restrict access to popular content? A side
eﬀect of deploying Genie is that it limits the total number
of proﬁle views (exposures) that a OSN user may receive to
the amount of credit on all the incoming links to the user.
We argue that such a restriction is often in the interests
