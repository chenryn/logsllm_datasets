# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I'm going through a ton of file renaming for a media player and I find I am
making several incremental changes to the same set of files.
It would be nice to have the option to make the changes but keep the current
files open.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
The rename button could change to a dropdown button with "rename" the primary
and "rename and keep open" with secondary option.
