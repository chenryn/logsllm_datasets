User: In a distributed system, how to ensure data consistency between different nodes? Please list at least two data consistency protocols, and briefly describe their working principles, advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Data consistency is a very critical issue in distributed systems. Generally, the following two protocols are used to ensure data consistency: 1. Two-Phase Commit (Two-Phase Commit, 2PC) protocol working principle: When a transaction is to be committed, it first asks Whether all participating nodes can submit. If all nodes can commit, the transaction is officially committed. If during the query process, a node finds that there may be problems with its commit, it can request to abort the entire transaction. The protocol is divided into two phases: - Preparation phase: the master node asks all slave nodes whether they can submit, and if and only if all nodes can submit, the master node notifies all nodes to submit; - Commit phase: all nodes begin to submit transactions, If all nodes submit successfully, the transaction is formally submitted, otherwise rollback operation is performed. Advantages: It can guarantee the strong consistency of data. If one of the participating nodes fails, the protocol can detect and block the submission of the entire transaction, ensuring data consistency. Disadvantages: All nodes need to be in a synchronized state, otherwise there will be a deadlock problem; it is necessary to wait for the query and submission of the master node, and the performance of the system will be reduced when the network delay is large. 2. The working principle of the version-based concurrency control (Optimistic Concurrency Control, OCC) protocol: When a transaction wants to modify data, it first determines whether the data has been modified by other transactions. If not, the transaction can continue to be modified. If it has been modified, the transaction is rolled back. The modification protocol is divided into three stages: - Read stage: read data and record the version number; - Write stage: perform modification operations; - Submit stage: check the version number, if it has not been modified, submit it formally, otherwise roll back the operation . Advantages: It is not necessary for every node to be in a synchronized state, and the update operation only needs to reject transactions that modify the same data at the same time, which improves the performance of the system. Disadvantages: Strong consistency of data cannot be guaranteed. In high concurrency scenarios, it will cause a large number of rollback operations and increase system overhead. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure the correctness of transaction commit order, otherwise different modifications of the same data may be overwritten or lost.
