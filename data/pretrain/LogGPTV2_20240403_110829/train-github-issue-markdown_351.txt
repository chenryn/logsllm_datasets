## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
may be related to #8422.
At the present time , when using next.js with other backend frameworks
(isomorphic applications), users have few controls to the logging facility of
next.js.
Users can only pass `{quiet: true}` when instantiate `next.js` object. But
doing these only hide error messages, still can not modify some logging
behaviours such as logging level or logging format.
I hope next.js can provide some mechanics for controlling dev logging
behaviour.
## Describe the solution you'd like
using more advanced logging framework such as winston maybe a good solution.
## Describe alternatives you've considered
## Additional context
I found next.js do have an abstract layer to handle logging(log.ts), while
some code use these abstract APIs to log( such as `bundled successfully` ),
some do not ( such as `Compiled successfully` )
Maybe with controllable logging is also make next.js avilable to provide more
detailed messages for debug using.
