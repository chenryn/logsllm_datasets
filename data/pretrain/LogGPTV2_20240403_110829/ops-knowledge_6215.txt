**User:**
I would like to print barcodes using my Zebra Desktop label printer on CentOS 6.5, but I have not found any Python drivers or scripts that I can use in my project. Does anyone know how to print barcodes on a Zebra printer?

**Assistant:**
To print barcodes on a Zebra printer using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Establish a Connection:**
   - **Network Printer:** Open a TCP connection to the printer on port 9100.
   - **USB Printer:** Use a Python USB library to establish a connection. Libraries such as `pyusb` or `usb.core` can be useful for this purpose.

2. **Send ZPL Commands:**
   - Once the connection is established, send a ZPL (Zebra Programming Language) command string to the printer. ZPL is a simple, text-based language used to format and print labels.
   - You can find detailed documentation and examples of ZPL commands, including those for printing barcodes, in the ZPL manual available on the Zebra website.

3. **Considerations:**
   - Standard Linux drivers typically support printing graphics and text but do not include barcode fonts. Using ZPL directly allows you to leverage the full capabilities of your Zebra printer, including barcode printing.

By following these steps, you should be able to print barcodes on your Zebra printer from a Python script running on CentOS 6.5.
