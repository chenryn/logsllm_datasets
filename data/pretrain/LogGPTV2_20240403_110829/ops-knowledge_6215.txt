User: I want to print Barcode on my Zebra Desktop label printer on CentOS 6.5 but I did not find any python drivers for that and did not found script so that i can use in my project.
Does anyone know how to print Barcode in Zebra printer?
Assistant: If you are printing to a network printer open a TCP connection to port 9100. If you are printing to a USB printer look up a USB library for python.
Once you have a connection send a print string formatted in ZPL. Look on the Zebra site for the ZPL manual. There are examples in there on how to print a barcode.
Normal Linux drivers will print graphics and text but do not have a barcode font.
