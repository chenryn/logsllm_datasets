title:blackhat:us-20 Engineering Empathy: Adapting Software Engineering Principles and Process to Security
Software engineering has a lot to teach our 'security engineering' teams - this session will be a live retrospective of a professional role reversal - dropping a principal security engineer into a runtime team, and placing a principal software engineer into the platform security assessment team.We've got stories and live object lessons.Attendees will return to work knowing exactly how we have implemented these ideas to partner with engineering to protect a world-class platform as a service running millions of customer containers and data services. This session is aimed at both IC's and management.Shifting left is a great marketing tagline.The valuable work is changing your security team's principles, processes, and culture to align with the principles, processes, and culture of your organization's software engineering teams allows you to develop empathy for their constraints, tools, and processes. It also allows you to build your own tools, processes, and requirements in ways that are more actionable, realistic, and easier to understand and implement.
