I want to contribute to the Electron project. I read the build instructions
and was able to build with no issues. Now I want to start making code changes,
but as Electron is built with Ninja and not XCode, I'm a little confused where
to begin.
  * What IDE should I be using?
  * Can I use XCode?
  * What is the recommended development/debugging workflow?
