Question: "A developer claims that setting the 'Secure' attribute alone on a session cookie is sufficient for ensuring its security. Which of the following is the best counterargument to this claim?"
 "A": "The 'Secure' attribute ensures that the cookie is only sent over HTTPS, but without 'HttpOnly', the cookie is still vulnerable to access through client-side scripts such as XSS."
 "B": "The 'Secure' attribute does not restrict the cookie to a specific domain, so it could be sent along with requests to any domain, potentially leaking session information."
 "C": "The 'Secure' attribute can prevent the cookie from being accessed by JavaScript, thus providing complete protection against XSS attacks."
 "D": "Setting the 'Secure' attribute could lead to performance issues due to the encryption overhead on all cookie transmissions."
Answer: A
