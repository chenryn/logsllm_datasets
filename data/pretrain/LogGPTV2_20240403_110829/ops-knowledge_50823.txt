User: I'm new to swift and I'm trying to run a Python file from it.
I already got the full path to the file, and my tries with NStask failed so far. 
Now I'm somehow stuck launching the python executable with the path to the script as a parameter :-/ I already thought of just creating an .sh file with the appropriate command in it (python $filename) and launch that, but isn't there another way?
Of course I'm running OS X 10.10
Thanks for any help!
Assistant: This should work:
system("python EXECUTABLE_PATH")
