### Remote Validation Authorities (VAs) and Performance

Remote VAs exhibit lower latency compared to the primary VA, resulting in a negligible performance penalty.

### Security Evaluation

- A single cloud provider can host remote VAs at multiple data centers with sufficient route diversity.
- Measurement experiments using ethical BGP hijacks enable evaluation with known ground truth.
- Simulation experiments can cover a wide range of attack scenarios for a systematic evaluation.

### Domain Control Validation

The VA resolves the requested domain to IP addresses using a recursive DNS resolver colocated with the VA. The VA performs HTTP, DNS, or TLS-based domain control validation as specified by RFC 8737 [47]. For HTTP and TLS validations, the VA uses DNS to look up an A or AAAA record for the requested domain and initiates an HTTP or TLS connection to the domain’s web server. In DNS-based validations, the VA checks for the validation response in a DNS TXT record for the requested domain.

### Certificate Issuance in CA Services

Certificate issuance in a CA service involves complex interactions between different system components. Minor modifications to the ACME protocol standard or the existing Boulder implementation can affect the reliability and security of the CA. Therefore, when designing the multi-vantage-point validation system, we aim to avoid changes to the ACME protocol and non-VA components in Boulder, while minimizing alterations to the existing VA component.

### Multi-Vantage-Point Validation Design

We present our design for multiVA, an incrementally deployable domain validation system that leverages multiple vantage points to mitigate BGP attacks against CAs. We first discuss our threat model and security goal. We then specify how our design complies with CA/Browser Forum policies without requiring audits on remote data centers. Next, we explain how we simplify management by using a single cloud provider to host vantage points. We also present our method for scalable and secure communication with vantage points and introduce a configurable quorum policy that balances security and benign failures. Finally, we outline our phased deployment strategy, which Let's Encrypt used to deploy our design in their live production environment.

#### Threat Model and Security Goal

We consider an adversary with control over a single malicious AS. The adversary aims to obtain a bogus certificate for a victim domain by launching BGP attacks against an IP prefix associated with that domain and hijacking domain control validation traffic. We do not consider adversaries that control CA or multiVA components or exploit non-BGP related vulnerabilities. Our goal is to improve the resilience of domains against BGP attacks during domain control validation.

#### Compliance and Manageability

The CA/Browser Forum governs the operations of publicly trusted CAs and imposes requirements that may constrain the deployment of multi-vantage-point validation. To resolve this, multiVA utilizes primary and remote validation authorities. The primary VA is located in a fully compliant data center and can validate certificates independently. Remote VAs are deployed in third-party networks or clouds. If the primary VA’s validation fails, the customer’s request fails. If the primary VA succeeds, it considers the results from remote VAs, and the request only succeeds if a specified number of remote VAs' validations have succeeded. This ensures compliance with the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements.

#### Using a Single Cloud Provider

Using multiple data centers with different cloud providers would be challenging due to varying billing policies and tooling requirements. We host all multiVA VAs in a single cloud provider (Amazon Web Services), achieving significant route diversity and improving manageability.

#### Secure Communication

Each component in multiVA is associated with a certificate bound to a specific role and communicates using gRPC over mutually-authenticated TLS. This ensures confidentiality, authorization, and authentication. Using gRPC saves round trips between the primary and remote VAs, introducing negligible latency compared to single-VA domain validation.

#### Configurable Quorum Policy

A quorum policy specifies the number of remote VAs required to agree on the validation result before signing a certificate. Requiring validation from a large number of remote VAs enhances security but increases the risk of incorrect rejections. Our multiVA system adopts a configurable quorum policy, initially set to n = 3 and k = 2, allowing at most one of three remote VAs to fail. This setup effectively improves security with an acceptable benign failure rate.

### Open-Source Implementation and Phased Deployment

We developed and released an open-source implementation of multiVA that any CA can use. Our implementation does not require changes to the ACME protocol and only modifies relevant components in the Boulder implementation. Let's Encrypt deployed multiVA in a staged, tested, and production environment, gradually applying it to most domain validation requests while maintaining a domain exception list for troubleshooting.

- **Staging Deployment**: Deployed in a functional duplicate of the production environment for internal and external testing.
- **Testing in Production Environment**: Introduced in a data-collection mode to gather detailed information on validation failures and performance bottlenecks.
- **Production Deployment with Domain Exception List**: Applied to most domain validation requests in February 2020, with a temporary exclusion list for domains that may have issues with multi-vantage-point validation.

This phased approach ensured a smooth transition and minimized disruptions for Let's Encrypt, the world's largest CA.
