@birkskyum: Regarding the issue of duplicate content, I believe that the Accounts module nested within `meteor/accounts-base` is necessary to maintain compatibility with the JavaScript code. However, could we potentially remove the global Accounts module?

@fullflavedave: It would be ideal to eliminate all duplications. This duplication was created when Meteor introduced support for ES2015 modules (the global modules were the original implementation). Does Meteor 1.4 still support global modules (e.g., for rapid prototyping)? If it does, then the global module definitions likely need to remain for backward compatibility. 

However, it would be beneficial if both the global Accounts module and the one nested in `meteor/accounts-base` could reference a single set of definitions, as should all other modules. My TypeScript skills are somewhat outdated, so I haven't explored whether this is feasible. Would you be willing to give it a try, @birkskyum? Let's create a separate issue for this and continue the discussion there.

@birkskyum: Sure, I'll take a look at it.
