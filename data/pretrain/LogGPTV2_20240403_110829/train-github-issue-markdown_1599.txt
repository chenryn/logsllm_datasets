@birkskyum: About duplicate content. I think the Accounts module nested in
meteor/accounts-base is necessary, in order to match the javascript, but can
the global Accounts module be removed?
@fullflavedave: It would be great to remove all the duplication. This was
created when Meteor added support for ES2015 modules (the global modules were
the original). Does Meteor 1.4 still support global modules (e.g. for super
quick prototyping)? If so, then the global module definitions probably need to
be there for backwards compatibility. However, it would be great if the global
Accounts module and the one nested in meteor/accounts-base referenced one set
of definitions (and all other modules too). My TypeScript skills are a little
out-dated, and I haven't fooled around to see if it's possible -- want to give
it a try @birkskyum? Let's add a separate issue and continue discussion there.
@birkskyum: Sure, I'll have a look at it.
