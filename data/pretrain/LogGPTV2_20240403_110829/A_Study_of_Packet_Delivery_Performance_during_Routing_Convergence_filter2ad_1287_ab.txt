4.1 Path Switch-over Period
4.2 Probability of Choosing Valid Paths
We say a path switch-over period starts when a router
discovers its current next hop can no longer reach a given
destination and ends when the router ﬁnds a new next
hop for the same destination. Because the router can-
not forward any packets for that destination during the
path switch-over period, an ideal network routing protocol
should have a minimal path switch-over period. Forward-
ing packets to an alternate next hop offers a chance that the
packets may eventually reach their destinations, even when
the next hop is not necessarily on the new shortest path af-
ter a failure.
In RIP, a router R only keeps the information for the
next hop along the shortest path. R loses the reachability to
a destination whenever the router detects the failure of the
link to the next hop or the next hop reports the destination
is unreachable. Although R’s other neighbors may not be
affected by the failure, these neighbors will not inform R
their reachability to the destination until the next periodic
update is due. Therefore, after a failure, a RIP router may
take up to 30 seconds before it learns an alternate path. As a
result, RIP suffers from a potentially long path switch-over
period. In contrast to RIP, a router running DBF or BGP
keeps a cache of the reachability information learned from
all its neighbors. When it can no longer reach a destination
through the current next hop, the router can immediately
select an alternate next hop for the destination, achieving a
zero time path switch-over. However note that there is no
guarantee that the selected alternate next hop leads to the
shortest route to the destination, nor that the next hop can
even reach the destination. This leads us to consider the
next important factor, probability of choosing valid paths.
Ideally, when the existing path fails, the router should
switch to a new path which does not use the failed link.
We call any alternate path that avoids the failed link a valid
path. The second factor of an ideal routing protocol is the
high probability of choosing a new next hop with a valid
path if there exist multiple alternate paths. A valid path can
be sub-optimal, as long as packets can reach the destination
while the routing protocol is converging.
“Split horizon with poison reverse” avoids two-hop
loops, thus helps increase the probability of valid alternate
paths after a failure. In all the three protocols we studied,
BGP is the only one that allows a node to check whether
a chosen alternate path contains a failed link in some re-
stricted cases. For example, [21] utilized this feature of
BGP to substantially reduce the routing convergence time.
However due to the existence of routing policies and other
constraints, after a route failure BGP may still alternate
among a number of new routes before converging to a sta-
ble route. Such transient route instability can happen in
all the three studied protocols, and is caused by inconsis-
tent connectivity information perceived by different routers
while the latest update is being propagated through the en-
tire network. This leads us to consider the third important
factor, propagation time of Failure information.
4.3 Propagation Time of Failure Information
Upon detection of a physical failure, an ideal routing
protocol should propagate the failure information through
the network as quickly as possible, so that all the routers
can recompute the shortest paths to the affected destina-
tions. However this propagation takes time, and due to the
distributed nature of distance-vector and path-vector algo-

rithms. If the new path is also invalid, packets following
that path are likely to be lost. However if the new path is
valid but sub-optimal, packets sent along that path have a
good chance to reach their destinations.
In RIP or DBF, upon detecting a failure a router sends a
triggered update instead of waiting for the next 30-second
update interval. BGP sends only triggered routing updates
upon route changes. In this sense, all the three studied pro-
tocols attempt to achieve the goal of quick propagation of
failed paths. However, because damping timers for trig-
gered update (3-second average for RIP, DBF and BGP’,
and 30-second average for BGP) are used to space out con-
secutive updates, a node delays the sending of all update
messages except the ﬁrst one. One exception is made in
BGP which does not apply the timer to withdrawal mes-
sages in order to propagate the unreachability information
quickly. But A link failure may cause route changes to
multiple destinations, and updates regarding these destina-
tions may not be received by a BGP router at the same time.
After a BGP router has processed all the changed path and
sent out corresponding updates, it turns on the MRAI timer.
After the timer is on, any newly changed paths to destina-
tions not in the previous update messages are delayed by
the per neighbor MRAI timer, but not by per(neighbor, des-
tination) MRAI timer.
4.4 The Impact of Network Topology
In addition to the routing protocol design choices, our
claim is that the ideal factors of a minimal path switch-
over period, a high probability of picking a valid path, and
fast propagation of updated connectivity information, all
beneﬁt from a richly connected network topology where
routers have a high connectivity degree. Intuitively, as a
network becomes more interconnected, the number of al-
ternate paths increases, and the probability that an alternate
path goes through the same failed link decreases. Further-
more, the rich connectivity also reduces the average path
length between any two points in the network. This re-
duced path length helps reduce the propagation time of the
failure information, which is related to not only the link
propagation delay but also the triggered update (or MRAI)
timer. For example, [13] has shown that the BGP conver-
gence time is proportional to the product of MRAI timer
value and the length of the longest backup paths.
5 Simulation Results and Analysis
We simulated RIP, DBF, BGP and BGP’ using IRLSim
simulator [26]. In the simulated networks, each link has
a unit cost, a propagation delay of 1 ms, and a transmis-
sion rate of 10 Mbps. A link failure is detected by the two
nodes attached to it within 5ms after the failure happens.
Each node has a packet queue sizes of 200 packets and
zero CPU processing delay. Note that because this paper
is a comparative study of different routing protocols, the
exact values of these parameters should have little impact
on the results.
In order to study the protocol behavior at different topo-
logical connectivity levels, we choose to use a family of
regular network topologies. A random topology presents
a random factor in each simulation run. Using regular
topologies removes this undesirable random factor and al-
lows us to clearly identify the impact of connectivity level
on the protocol performance. The simulated network topol-
ogy is a mesh of N rows by N columns and each node in
the network (except those on the border) has the same node
degree d. There are various ways to construct such topolo-
gies, we use a deterministic method similar to the one used
by Baran in [2]; [20] provides more details on the construc-
tion of these network topologies. As an example Figure 2
shows three example topologies for N = 5 and d = 4, 5, 6.
We run each simulation experiment for 800 seconds.
There is a warm-up period after each simulation starts, dur-
ing which time period the network nodes exchange routing
update messages and the routing table at each node stabi-
lizes. At time t = 390 seconds, a single sender starts send-
ing IP packets with TTL=127 to a single receiver at a con-
stant transmission rate of 20 packets/second. The sender
and the receiver are connected to a randomly chosen router
on the ﬁrst row and last row of the regular topology, respec-
tively. At time t = 400 seconds, one of the links along the
shortest path between the sender and receiver is randomly
chosen to fail. We simulated topologies with N = 7 and
d ranging from 3 to 16. For each topology with a different
node degree, we conducted 100 simulation runs to collect
statistically valid performance measurement. Due to the
space limitation, in the paper we use the topologies with
N = 5 shown Figure 2 to help explain our observations.
5.1 Packets Drops due to No Reachability
When a packet arrives at a router which is in the switch-
over period after a failure, the packet is dropped because
the the router does not know the next top to reach the desti-
nation. Figure 3 shows the average number of packet drops
due to lack of reachability over 100 simulation runs.
Observation 1 For all the three examined routing proto-
cols, the number of packet drops decreases as the node de-
gree increases until it reaches 6.
When the node degree is 6 or more, there are virtually no
packet drops with DBF, BGP, and BGP’. But in RIP, packet
drops improve only slightly with the increase in node de-
gree.
Our explanation is the following. Consider the behavior
of a node A that lies on the shortest path from the sender
to the receiver.
In a sparse network, it is often the case
that A is chosen by its neighbors as the next hop to the
destination. Thus when A learns that its current next hop
to the destination is no longer valid, its neighbors cannot
immediately offer an alternate path to the destination. For

Figure 2. Link Failures in Networks with node degree 4,5 and 6
example, consider the behavior of node 17 in Figure 2(a)
(a sparse topology with degree 4). Node 17 is chosen by
neighbors 12, 16, 18 as the next hop to the destination and
nodes 12, 16, 18 use Poison-Reverse loop prevention to in-
form node 17 that their distance to the receiver is inﬁnity.
When link (17 22) fails, node 17 ﬁnds no alternate path
until next periodic update cycle when the new reachability
through nodes [16, 21, 22] or [18, 23, 22] is discovered.
Similar situations can happen to the other nodes along the
shortest path before the failure, i.e. nodes 2, 7, and 12.
On the other hand, a densely connected network makes
it likely that a node A has one or more neighbors whose
shortest path to the destination does not go through A. For
example, consider node 12 in Figure 2(c) (a topology with
degree 6). Before the failure node 12’s next hop to the des-
tination is node 22 and under DBF, BGP and BGP’ node 12
also keeps the information from its neighbor node 17 about
its reachability to the destination. When link (12 22) fails,
node 12 immediately ﬁnds the alternate path [12, 17, 22]
and starts forwarding packets along this new path. Compar-
ison of Figure 2(a) and 2(c) shows that increasing the node
degree to 6 essentially guarantees that all the nodes on the
initial shortest path can ﬁnd a valid alternate path after any
link along the shortest path fails. But a network running
RIP largely depends on the periodic updates to propagate
information about alternative paths after a failure and node
12 does not learn of the alternate path via node 17 until the
next update. A higher node degree only slightly reduces
the propagation delay of the periodic update messages and
the number of packet drops in RIP decreases only slightly.
5.2 Number of TTL Expirations
Figure 4 shows the number of packets dropped due to
TTL expirations. Given the large TTL value (127) and the
small size of the simulated topology, all the TTL expira-
tions are caused by routing loops during convergence.
Observation 2 For topologies with a node degree below
6, BGP has the largest number of TTL expirations while
RIP has no TTL expirations. When the node degree is 6 or
higher, there are no TTL expirations.
The reason no TTL expirations occur under RIP is the fol-
lowing. Whenever a link failure happens, a triggered up-
date is sent quickly. and with our 1ms link delay, the failure
information can propagate along the path in a few millisec-
onds. Furthermore, packets enter the network at a relatively
slower rate of 20 packets/second and because a RIP node
keeps no alternative path information, the node next to the
sender will drop all the incoming packets when the current
shortest path fails. As Figure 3 shows, RIP avoids loop-
ing by simply dropping all the incoming packets till new
reachability is established.
Analysis of the routing and forwarding traces shows
that BGP’s slow convergence problem [11] combined with
the MRAI timer are mainly responsible for the forwarding
loops with the topology of node degree 5. For example,
nodes 2,7, and 12 in Figure 2(b), can easily form a rout-
ing loop. At one moment during the simulation, node 2’s
path is [2 12 7 17 22] while node 12’s path is [12 2 7 17
22]. However, MRAI timers of both node 2 and node 12
have been turned on by some previously exchanged updates
and no new updates can be sent before one of the timers
expires, thus a forwarding loop is formed. This example
shows that different nodes based on inconsistent informa-
tion might form a transient loop, and the looping period is
lengthened by the MRAI timer. The number of TTL expi-
rations in BGP is about 10 times of that in BGP’, and this
is consistent with the fact that average MRAI timer value
in BGP(30 seconds) is about 10 times of that in BGP’(3
seconds).
Although the MRAI timer value for BGP’ is about the
same as the damping timer for DBF, the two routing pro-
tocols show noticeable difference in the number of TTL
expirations. This difference is due to some speciﬁc de-
