specific values of β and r) and (b) the metric over the records. Thus,
making it exceedingly difficult to analyze it in general.
We use the example given in Figure 4 to explain the above
mentioned relationships of mdd-function. This figure depicts a
subgraph of 1-sensitive neighborhood graph for (β = 3, r = 1)-
anomaly. One can appreciate the conceptual difficulty in calcu-
lating mdd-function, ∆GS
(for this setting) by for example think-
ing the value of ∆GS (5, (3, 0, 0, 0, 1)) (and recall that this is just
a 1-sensitive neighborhood graph). Next, note that for a given
database x and a record i, the shorter is the distance of the clos-
est sensitive record from i, the smaller the value of ∆GS (i, x ), e.g.
∆GS (5, (3, 0, 0, 0, 1)) > ∆GS (5, (3, 2, 1, 0, 1)). Furthermore, the pres-
ence of non-sensitive records can also influence the value of the
mdd-function, e.g. ∆GS (5, (3, 0, 0, 0, 1)) > ∆GS (5, (3, 0, 1, 0, 1)) al-
though the closest sensitive record to 5 is the same in both the
databases. In addition, the values of β and r also affect the value of
Below, we provide our constructions that uses a lower bound
on the mdd-function to give sensitively private mechanism, which
does not depend upon any particular definition of anomaly. Thus it
can be used to give private mechanisms for AIQ’s as long as one is
able to compute the lower bound.
4.1 Construction: SP-mechanism for AIQ by
lower bounding mdd-function
Here, we show how to construct an SP mechanism for identifying
anomalies by using a lower bound, λ, for the mdd-function. Our
construction (Construction 1) will be parameterized by λ, which
is associated with a sensitive neighborhood graph. Since the sen-
sitive neighborhood graph is tied to an anomaly definition, it will
become concrete once we give the definition of anomaly (e.g., see
Section 4.1.1 and Section 4.1.2).
For any fixed AIQ, (i, д), and given λ, Construction 1 provably
gives an SP mechanism as long as λ fulfills the following two prop-
erties: (1) for every i and x, λ(i, x ) ≥ 1 and (2) λ is 1-Lipschitz
continuous lower bound on the mdd-function (Theorem 4.1).
For a sensitive neighborhood graph, GS , we say a function f :
X × D → R is α-Lipschitz continuous if for every i ∈ X and
neighboring databases x and y in GS , | f (i, x ) − f (i, y)| ≤ α.
We remark that although at first it appears that the Lipschitz
continuity condition is some side technicality, in fact bounding its
value constitute the main part of our argument for privacy of our

tion 1 reduces to giving a Lipschitz continuous lower bound for the
mdd-function corresponding to д.
Construction 1. Uλ
(1) Input x ∈ D.
(2) Set t = e−ε (λ(i,x )−1)/(1 + eε ).
(3) Sample b from {0, 1} such that P (b (cid:44) д(i, x )) = t.
(4) Return b.
Note that the above is a family of constructions parameterized
by λ (as mentioned above), i.e., one construction, Uλ, for each λ.
This construction is very efficiently realizable as long as we can effi-
ciently compute д and λ. Furthermore, the error of the mechanism,
yielded by the construction, for any input is exponentially small in
λ (Claim 2, which immediately follows from the construction).
Claim 2. For given ε, (i, д), and λ, Uλ (Construction 1) is such that
P (U (x ) (cid:44) д(i, x )) = e−ε (λ(i,x )−1)/(1 + eε ) for every x.
Theorem 4.1 (Uλ is SP). For any given ε, AIQ, and a 1-Lipschitz
continuous lower bound λ on the corresponding mdd-function for
k-sensitive neighborhood graph, GS , such that λ ≥ 1, Construction 1
yields an (ε, k )-sensitively private mechanism.
In order to show that the theorem holds, it suffices to verify
that for every i and every two neighboring x and y in GS , the
privacy constraints hold. For any AIQ, (i, д), this is immediate when
д(i, x ) = д(i, y) because λ is 1-Lipschitz continuous. When д(i, x ) (cid:44)
д(i, y), λ(i, x ) = λ(i, y) = 1 because ∆GS (i, x ) = ∆GS (i, y) = 1
and λ ≥ 1. Thus, the constraints are satisfied in this case as well.
The complete proof for Theorem 4.1 is given in Appendix A.4.
Additionally, a simple observation on the proof of Theorem 4.1,
shows that if the given λ is α-Lipschitz continuous with α ≥ 1, then
Construction 1 yields an (ε · α )-sensitively private mechanism.
In the following two sections, we instantiate Construction 1 to
give differentially private and sensitively private mechanisms for
performing (β, r )-anomaly identification query. We will use these
mechanisms in our empirical evaluation over real world datasets.
4.1.1 Optimal DP-mechanism for (β, r )-AIQ. Here, we show
how to use Construction 1 to give an optimal differentially private
mechanism for (β, r )-AIQ. Note that we will use this mechanism in
experimental evaluation (Section 5) and compare its performance
with our SP mechanism (which we will present shortly). We begin
by restating the definition of DP in terms of the neighborhood graph.
This restatement will immediately establish that SP generalizes DP,
a fact we will use to build DP mechanism.
Definition 4.2 (DP restated with neighborhood graph). For ε > 0,
a mechanism, M, with domain D, is ε-differentially private if for
every two neighboring databases, x and y, in the neighborhood
graph, and every R ⊆ Ranдe (M ),
P (M (x ) ∈ R) ≤ eε P (M (y) ∈ R) .
From Definition 3.2 (of sensitive privacy) and Definition 4.2, it is
clear that differential privacy is a special case of sensitive privacy,
when the k-sensitive neighborhood graphs, GS , is the same as
neighborhood graph, G, i.e., GS = G. Thus, for GS = G, a mechanism
is ε-differentially private if and only if it is ε-sensitively private. This
observation is sufficient to give a differentially private mechanism
for AIQ by using Construction 1.
We use λ = ∆G in Construction 1 to give the DP mechanism for
(β, r )-AIQ, where ∆G (mdd-function) for an arbitrary β, r , i and x
is given below. This will yield a DP mechanism as long as the given
∆G for (β, r )-AIQ is 1-Lipschitz continuous, a fact that immediately
follows from the above observation and Theorem 4.1. We claim
that for any given β and r, ∆G (given by (2)) is mdd-function for
the (β, r )-AIQ and is 1-Lipschitz continuous (Lemma 4.3).

(2)
Lemma 4.3. For any fixed (β, r )-AIQ, (i, д), the ∆G given by (2) is
mdd-function for д and is 1-Lipschitz continuous.
The proof of Lemma 4.3 can be found in Appendix A.5.
We claim that for any fixed (β, r )-AIQ, (i, д), U∆G
(given by our
construction) is differentially private and errs minimum for all the
inputs (Theorem 4.4), namely, it is pareto optimal. We say U∆G
is
pareto optimal ε-DP mechanism if (a) it is ε-DP and (b) for every
ε-DP mechanism M : D → {0, 1} and every database x ∈ D,
P (U∆G (x ) = д(i, x )) ≥ P (M (x ) = д(i, x )). Particularly, this implies
that of all the DP mechanisms yielded by Construction 1, each
corresponding to a different λ, the “best” mechanism is for λ = ∆G.

4.1.2 SP-mechanism for (β, r )-AIQ. We employ Construction 1
to give a (ε, k )-sensitively private mechanism for (β, r )-AIQ. We
provide λk below, which is 1-Lipschitz continuous lower bound
on the mdd-function for the k-sensitive neighborhood graph for
(β, r )-anomaly (Lemma 4.5). For the λk, Construction 1 yields Uλk
that is (ε, k )-SP mechanism, and for non-sensitive records Uλk
can
have exponentially small error in β (Theorem 4.6).

in a very sparse region).
