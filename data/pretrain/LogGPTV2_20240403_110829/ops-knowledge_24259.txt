User: When a web application has a connection pool leak problem, how to diagnose and solve it?
Assistant: 1. Monitor connection pool performance: Monitoring connection pool performance is the first step in diagnosing problems. You can use the connection pool management tool or monitor it through the JMX connection pool MBean. 2. Confirm the cause of the leak: Further analysis needs to look at the usage of the connection pool to see if any individual requests are taking up too many connections. If the problematic page cannot close the connection in time due to timeout, interface request blocking or network error, the connection may be required to bind the cache or be kept for a long time. 3. Check whether the JDBC implementation has bugs: If the implementation of the connection pool uses JDBC drivers such as Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, then you need to check whether the specific driver has bugs or version problems. This can be confirmed in official documents, technical support communities, or third-party developer communities. 4. Confirm whether the connection pool is correctly configured in the web container: Different web containers support and implement connection pool management in different ways, so you need to ensure that the connection pool configuration of each container is correct. This can be confirmed by looking at the container documentation, configuration files, etc. 5. Scrolling error logs and stack traces: Careful scrolling of error logs is the key to solving connection pool leaks. Details about the cause of the failure that caused the connection pool leak may be available in the error log. A stack trace can help locate the source code location of the problem. 6. Adjust and optimize according to the specific situation: Adjust and optimize according to the specific situation, which may include increasing the size of the connection pool, using the connection pool recycling mechanism, optimizing the timeout setting, etc.
