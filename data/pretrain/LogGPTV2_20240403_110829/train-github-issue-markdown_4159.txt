this is what causing the problem  
``
This is a bug that i saw when making production build.
**Below images the left side is development and right side is production.**
This is my component.

Dev classes | Prod classes  
---|---  
MuiPaper-root-7 | c7  
MuiPaper-shadow2-b | cb  
MuiPaper-rounded-8 | c8  
inject-Forgot-with-LangarStore-paper-3 | c3  
Below you see `.c7` = `.MuiPaper-root-7` which should only have `background-
color: #424242;`.  
But in production it has another set of `style` declarations.

Turns out in production `.inject-DarkError-with-DarkErrorStore-LangarStore-
root-7` and `.MuiPaper-root-7` are given the same classname `.c7`
