After upgrading from version 2.4.10 to 2.5.6, I encountered the following error:

```
_Variable "welcome_title" does not exist ...
```

### Configuration in `config.yml`

In my `config.yml` file, I have the following configuration for Twig globals:

```yaml
twig:
    globals:
        welcome_title: Welcome!
```

### Investigation

Upon further investigation, I found a difference in the generated `app/cache/dev/appDevDebugProjectContainer.php` file between the two versions.

#### Version 2.4.10

In version 2.4.10, the `appDevDebugProjectContainer.php` file contains the following code:

```php
...
$instance->addGlobal('app', $this->get('templating.globals'));
$instance->addGlobal('welcome_title', 'Welcome!');
return $instance;
```

#### Version 2.5.x (tested with 2.5.1, 2.5.4, and 2.5.6)

In version 2.5.x, the `appDevDebugProjectContainer.php` file only contains:

```php
...
$instance->addGlobal('app', $this->get('templating.globals'));
return $instance;
```

### Conclusion

It appears that the `welcome_title` global variable is no longer being added in the newer versions of the framework. This change may be a bug or an intentional modification in the framework's behavior.

### Suggestions

1. **Check the Upgrade Guide**: Review the upgrade guide for version 2.5.0 to see if there are any notes about changes to the way global variables are handled in Twig.
2. **Manual Addition**: As a workaround, you can manually add the `welcome_title` global in your application. For example, in a service definition or in a controller before rendering the template.
3. **Report the Issue**: If this change is unexpected and not documented, consider reporting it as a potential bug to the framework's issue tracker.
