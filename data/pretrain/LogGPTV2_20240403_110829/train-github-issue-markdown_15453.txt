When running `flutter doctor`, it is essential to ensure that the user has sufficiently up-to-date versions of Android Studio, Xcode, and other required software.

During my Flutter installation, I encountered an issue when using the Google Managed Software Center to install Android Studio and Xcode. The center installed very old versions of these tools, which led to errors. It is recommended to verify and update the versions of these tools to the latest or a compatible version to avoid such issues.
