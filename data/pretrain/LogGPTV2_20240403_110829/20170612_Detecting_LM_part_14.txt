4. Acquiring Additional Logs
This chapter describes the importance of acquiring detailed logs that cannot be obtained with the
default settings as stated in the findings reported in Chapter 3, and matters that should be taken into
consideration when acquiring additional detailed logs.
4.1. Importance of Acquiring Additional Logs
This research found that the tools installed by default in Windows leave execution traces of
evidence in event logs, but most tools that are not installed in Windows do not leave execution traces
of evidence anywhere. For example, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), a tool for remote login, and
"at", a tool for scheduling tasks, leave evidence of execution in the event logs
Microsoft\Windows\TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager\Operational and Microsoft\Windows
\TaskScheduler\Operational, respectively, indicating that the tools have been executed.
Conversely, in an environment where the audit policy is enabled and Sysmon is installed for
acquiring additional logs, evidence of execution of most tools can be acquired. For example, by
configuring audit policy settings, when a temporary file is created, it can be recorded in the event log.
As a result, if an attacker attempts to collect account information by using "csvde", the temporary file
that is created, C:\Users\[User_Name]\AppData\Local\Temp\csv[Random_Number].tmp, is recorded
in the event log. To investigate the execution of tools, these settings need to be configured in
advance to acquire detailed logs.
Note that detailed logs can be acquired with audit software (such as asset management software)
without enabling the audit policy and installing Sysmon. When such software monitors the following
Windows OS operations, it can be recorded in a similar manner as in an environment where the audit
policy is enabled and Sysmon is installed:
â€¢ Executing processes
â€¢ Writing files
4.2. Precautions When Changing the Additional Log Acquisition Settings
The increase in the amount of logs should be considered in advance when acquiring additional
detailed logs. Because the amount of logs increases when the audit policy is enabled, log rotation
accelerates, and older logs are maintained for a shorter period of time. Therefore, when enabling the
audit policy, consider changing the maximum size of event logs at the same time. The maximum size
of event logs can be changed with Event Viewer or the "wevtutil" command.
Note that changing the maximum size of event logs may exhaust storage capacity. JPCERT/CC
recommends that storage capacity be evaluated before changing the maximum size of event logs.

5. How to Use This Report in Incident Investigation
This chapter describes how this research report can be used in the field of incident investigation
through same examples using the results in Chapter 3 of this report.
5.1. Incident Investigation Using This Report
Chapter 3 was created on the assumption that it will be used when identifying tools that might be
executed as part of incident investigations. Searching for keywords, such as an event ID and file
name of a characteristic event log and a registry entry found during incident investigation, can find
out possible tools that were executed.
An incident investigation often starts by checking any suspicious logs in the "Security" event log.
Then, if "Event ID: 4663 (An attempt was made to access an object)" is found for example, it is
assumed that there is evidence that the file was created
192.168.100.100-PWHashes.txt
temporarily (recorded when the audit policy is enabled). Searching Chapter 3 for the distinctive text
finds it is a file created when PWDumpX is executed.
PWHashes.txt
Further proceeding with the investigation while referring to Section 3.3.2 finds that "PWDumpX" is
a command attackers execute to acquire a password hash. Additionally, the fact that the temporary
file [Destination_Address] was created implies that the attacker had completed the
-PWHashes.txt
purpose of acquiring the password hash on the server with IP address 192.168.100.100.
Investigating the server with IP address 192.168.100.100 explains that the file
was created and executed, and the fact that the service
C:\Windows\System32\DumpSvc.exe
"PWDumpX Service" was installed is recorded as "Event ID: 7045 (A service was installed in the
system)." This allows for determining that the attacker acquired the password hash for the IP address
192.168.100.100.
Section 3.16 describes how to verify that each tool was executed. Referring to the section for
planning an investigation strategy in advance of commencing an incident investigation is encouraged
as it shows information recorded by each tool in a list.
71
6. Conclusion
As it is becoming apparent that many organizations have suffered damage due to targeted attacks,
the importance of incident investigations to further examine such damage is increasing. This report
summarizes and presents evidence suggesting the execution of tools and its corresponding
relationship with tools, which are the key to a successful incident investigation.
Many tools do not leave evidence of having been executed with the default Windows settings,
which may cause incident investigations to remain unsolved. To analyze what the attacker did in
detail, an environment that allows for more logs to be collected than those obtained with the default
settings needs to be prepared in advance.
Under the current circumstances where it is difficult to prevent infiltration of a network, it is
important to always consider and improve the method for acquiring logs to analyze the amount of
damage after an incident occurs in order to prevent the spread of damage and review post-incident
security measures. In addition to reviewing and being prepared for responses that are not limited to
the method for acquiring additional logs using Windows standard functionality as shown in this report,
also use other methods that combine the use of audit software or similar. Moreover, JPCERT/CC
recommends that this report be used to identify evidence of tool execution by attackers in the event
of a suspicious incident. JPCERT/CC hopes that this report will be of help in early detection and
accurate response to targeted attacks, which are becoming more sophisticated.

7. Appendix A
This appendix describes how to install Sysmon and how to enable the audit policy. Note that it has
been confirmed that setting up the audit policy and installing Sysmon will increase the amount of
event logs. Before enabling the setting and installing the tool, it is recommended to verify its impact.
7.1. How to Install Sysmon
1. Download Sysmon from the following site:
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dn798348
2. Execute the command prompt as a user with administrator privileges and execute the
following command:
>Sysmon.exe -i
* Although adding the option "-n" enables network connection logs to be acquired, network
connection should be dealt with in the audit policy.
7.2. How to Enable the Audit Policy
The following describes how to enable the audit policy on a local computer. Note that the following
shows settings in Windows 10.
1. Open the Local Group Policy Editor. (Enter "gpedit.msc" into the [Search] box and execute it.)
2. Select [Computer Configuration]â†’[Windows Settings]â†’[Security Settings]â†’[Local
Policies]â†’[Audit Policy], and enable "Success" or "Failure" for each policy.
73
3. Select [Local Disk (C:)]â†’[Properties]â†’[Security] tabâ†’[Advanced].
74
4. On the [Auditing] tab, add an object to be audited.
5. As shown below, select the user to be audited and access method to be audited.
