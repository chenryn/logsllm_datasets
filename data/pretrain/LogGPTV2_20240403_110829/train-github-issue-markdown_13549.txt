Hi, developers,
When I used the StratifiedShuffleSplit or train_test_split with stratify
option, I input the continuous variable. I thought the function will split the
dataset into several subsets according to the continuous variable, and ensure
the distribution of these subsets were the same.  
However, I got the error 'The least populated class in y has only 1 member,
which is too few'. According to this error, I guess the stratifed split in
scikit-learn can only be used for classification problems.  
So, with scikit-learn, how can I split the dataset into several subsets with
the same distribution for a regression problem?
Have a good holiday.
## Best wishses
