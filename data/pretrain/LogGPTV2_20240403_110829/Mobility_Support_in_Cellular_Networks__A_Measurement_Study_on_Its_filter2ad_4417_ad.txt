### Intra-Frequency and Non-Intra-Frequency Measurements

Intra-frequency measurements generally require less time compared to non-intra-frequency measurements, which must assess other frequency bands and thus incur higher overhead. Consequently, the threshold for intra-frequency measurements (Θ_intra) should be no smaller than that for non-intra-frequency measurements (Θ_nonintra), ensuring that Θ_nonintra ≤ Θ_intra always holds true.

We present the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Θ_intra − Θ_nonintra in Figure 11 (left), along with all observed value pairs. The data clearly show that this condition (Θ_intra ≥ Θ_nonintra) is satisfied in the tested areas. Notably, in 5% of cases, Θ_intra equals Θ_nonintra, indicating that both types of measurements use the same criteria and are invoked simultaneously. However, our larger-scale study revealed rare counterexamples where non-intra-frequency measurements were performed more frequently than intra-frequency ones, but these instances were limited to specific areas and carriers.

### Association of Measurements with Handoff Decisions

To determine if all measurements are closely associated with subsequent handoff decisions, we examined whether rS (serving cell signal strength) falls within the range rS − ∆min to rS + 4dB (for equal-priority cells, refer to Equation 3). Our analysis shows that intra-frequency measurements are typically triggered when rS > 30dB in 95% of cases. This large gap suggests that intra-frequency measurements are less necessary when the serving cell is strong, as handoffs only occur when the serving cell is weak (e.g., a small value for Θ_low).

### Temporal Dynamics of Configuration Parameters

We also investigated the temporal dynamics of configuration parameters by examining the number of distinct samples over time. Our dataset, which includes multiple samples for certain configuration parameters, is sufficient to analyze these dynamics. We found that the temporal dynamics vary between idle-state and active-state handoff configuration parameters. Figure 13b (with two y-axes) illustrates the percentage of LTE cells with distinct samples observed over time. If a cell has multiple samples for the same parameter in one round, it is counted as t=0. The results indicate that configuration updates over time are rare, with idle-state handoff parameters being updated less frequently. Both idle-state and active-state parameters do not vary significantly over time (idle: 0.4% to 1.6%, active: 21.2% to 24.1%, up to 2 years, mostly within 6 months). Active-state handoffs are updated more frequently.

**Implications:** Given the low temporal dynamics, our data collection, even with a one-time observation, is sufficient. In our subsequent study, we consider unique samples to avoid biasing distributions in favor of cells with many identical samples.

### Complex and Diverse Configurations in a US Carrier

We first characterized handoff configurations using one US carrier (AT&T) and then extended our analysis to other carriers in Section 5.3. Our findings reveal that configurations are complex and diverse across all carrier networks. We measured this complexity and diversity in terms of the number of unique values, their distribution, and dispersion over the value range.

Figure 14 plots the distribution of eight representative parameters selected from Table 2. These results are consistent with our earlier findings in Section 4 (three cities only). We made three key observations:

1. **Multiple Distinct Values:** Most parameters have multiple distinct values, except for the hysteresis for the serving cell’s radio signal evaluation (Hs = 4dB). Some parameters, such as Θ_low, Θ_nonintra, and Θ_A5,S, have around 20+ options.
2. **Diverse Distributions:** The distributions of these parameters vary widely. Some have a skewed distribution with one or a few dominant values (e.g., ∆min, the measurement calibration threshold, mainly set at -122dB). Others have a relatively even distribution across most values (e.g., the priority of the serving cell Ps, ranging from 0 to 7 for LTE cells).
3. **Richness and Dispersion:** Among the parameters with distinct values, diversity is multifaceted, with consistent or divergent patterns in their distribution, dispersion, and richness. For instance, Θ_A5,S, Θ_low, and Θ_nonintra are consistently diverse. In contrast, the serving priority Ps (index: 31) is diverse in distribution but not in dispersion and richness. Other parameters like Θ_higher (index: 18) have high richness and dispersion but medium (lower) distribution diversity due to the dominance of one or two values.

**Implications:** Operators have the power to implement fine-grained handoff management with diverse configurations, allowing for nuanced control over network performance.

### Diversity Measures of LTE Handoff Parameters in AT&T

Figure 16 shows the diversity measures of all observed handoff configuration parameters in AT&T, sorted by Simpson Index. We only observed a subset of configuration parameters because AT&T does not support 3G EVDO and 2G CDMA technologies (some parameters are not applicable). Some events (e.g., B1, B2, A6) were not observed or rarely observed (e.g., A1, A4) and were omitted. Each configuration parameter has a unique diversity pattern, with the exception of parameters with no or low diversity (index ≤ 16 or 8). The first 8 parameters are single-valued, and parameters 9-16 are dominated by a single value. These parameters lack rich diversity because they are primarily used for calibration or are associated with other varying parameters (e.g., Event A3 uses both an offset and a hysteresis; the hysteresis remains fixed as the offset varies). This approach still provides carriers with sufficient power for fine-grained handoff management.

**Implications:** Operators can achieve fine-grained handoff management with diverse configurations, enabling them to tailor network performance effectively.
