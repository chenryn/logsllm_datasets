intra-freq measurements? This is intuitively the case, since intra-
freq measurements take less time and non intra-freq ones must
measure other frequency bands with larger overhead. Therefore,
Θintr a should be no smaller than Θnonintr a so that Θnonintr a ≤
Θintr a always holds true. We plot the CDF of Θintr a − Θnonintr a
in Fig. 11 (left), along with all value pairs observed. Clearly, it
holds true (≥ 0) in these tested areas. We also note that it becomes
zero (Θintr a = Θnonintr a) in 5% cases. This means that, both
measurements use the same criteria and will be invoked at the same
time. However, some counterexamples are found in our larger-scale
study though very rare (only observed from two carriers in specific
areas) In those cases , non-intra freq measurements are performed
even more often than intra-freq ones.
(2) Will all measurements be closely associated with the subse-
quent handoff decision? We infer the occurrence of measurements
by examining whether rS − ∆min  rS +
4dB (equal-priority), refer to Eq. (3). However, intra-freq measure-
ments are triggered when rS 30dB in 95% cases). Such a big gap implies that intra-freq
measurements performed when the serving cell is strong are much
less necessary because handoffs only happen when the serving cell
(s)
is quite weak (e.g., a small value for Θ
). We also observe another

interesting finding of Θnonintr a  1 samples for certain
configuration parameter and our dataset suffices to examine tempo-
ral dynamics. We find that temporal dynamics vary with idle-state
and active-state handoff configuration parameters. We plot the per-
centage of LTE cells with distinct samples observed over time in
Fig. 13b (two y-axes). If the cell is observed with multiple samples
for the same parameter in one round, it will be counted into the
t=0 case. We see that configuration updates over time are re-
ally rare; Those idle-state handoff parameters are updated
less frequently. Both idle-state and active-state do not vary too
much over time (idle: 0.4% to 1.6%, active: 21.2% to 24.1%, up to 2
years, mostly in 6 months). Active-state handoffs are updated more
frequently.
Implications: Given low temporal dynamics, our data collection
even with only one-time observation is enough. In our following
study, we consider unique samples, so as not to tip distributions in
favor of cells with many same samples.
5.2 Complex and Diverse Configurations in
One US Carrier
We first use one US carrier (AT&T) to characterize handoff config-
urations in reality and then extend to other carriers in §5.3. We
find that configurations are quite complex and diverse in all carrier
networks. We characterize such complexity and diversity in terms
of three measures: the number of unique values, the distribution
and the dispersion over the value range.
Fig. 14 plots the distribution of eight representative parameters
selected from Table 2. This is no surprise that they are consistent
with our findings in §4 (three cities only). We have three observa-
tions. First, there are multiple distinct values for most parameters,
except the hysteresis for the serving cell’s radio signal evaluation

Hs (4dB). On the extreme end, some parameters such as Θ
,

Θnonintr a and ΘA5,S have around 20+ options. Second, their distri-
butions vary a lot as well. Some have a skewed distribution with one
or few dominant values (e.g., ∆min, the measurement calibration

E[X] and V ar[X] are the expectation and variance of the data X
(Xj , j = 1· · · N ). Simpson index ranges from [0, 1] and a lower value
indicates less diversity. A lower coefficient in Cv indicates lesser
dispersion in value.
Fig. 16 shows the diversity measures of all handoff configuration
parameters observed in AT&T, sorted in the increasing order of
Simpson Index. We only observe a subset of configuration param-
eters because AT&T does not support 3G EVDO and 2G CDMA
technologies (some parameters not applicable). Some events are not
observed (say, B1, B2, A6) or rarely observed (say A1, A4). Those
parameters are omitted as well. We confirm that each configuration
parameter has its unique diversity pattern. The only exception is
those parameters with no/low diversity (index ≤ 16 or 8). In fact,
the first 8 parameters are single valued and No.9-16 are dominated
by a single value. We find that these parameters do not exhibit
rich diversity because they are primarily used for calibration or are
associated with other varying parameters (e.g., Event A3 uses both
an offset and a hysteresis; The hysteresis remains fixed as the offset
varies). This way, carriers are still armed with sufficient power for
fine-grained handoff management. Among those parameters with
distinct values, diversity is multi-faceted with consistent or diver-
gent patterns among their distribution, dispersion and richness. For
instance, ΘA5,S (index:32), Θ
(index:22) and Θnonintr a (in-
dex:23), are consistently diverse, but the serving priority Ps (index:
31) is diverse in the distribution but not in dispersion and richness.
In contrast, Θ
(index:18) have high
richness and dispersion but medium (lower) distribution diversity
because one or two values are dominant in use.

Implications: operators have power to realize fine-grained handoff

tribution across most values (e.g., the priority of the serving cell Ps
as 0-7 for LTE cells). This indicates that AT&T does not treat all 4G
LTE cells equally with finer-grained priority settings. However, it
