Hello everyone,

I believe the GitHub wiki is currently the primary source of information for new developers joining our repository. As it stands, only collaborators have the ability to update it. I propose that we consider creating a new section in our main documentation rather than relying on the GitHub wiki. For instance, we could add a `Contributors` subsection under the `Code` section of the main page.

In addition to migrating the content from the GitHub wiki, I suggest creating a "Common Issues" page. This would serve as a reference for frequently encountered problems, allowing us to quickly close duplicate issues by linking to the relevant section. Furthermore, there are some outdated or unnecessary pages, such as the API reference, that could be removed.

Implementing these changes could help reduce miscommunication, expedite the review process, and lower the barrier to entry for new contributors.

I am willing to draft a first version of the updated documentation, but I would like to gather feedback from the team before proceeding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
