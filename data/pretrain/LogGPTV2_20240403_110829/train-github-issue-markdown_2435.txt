Hey all,
So I believe the github wiki is the first main source of info for new
developers to the repo. As far as I'm aware, only collaborators can update it.
It may be an idea to create a new section in the docs instead of using the
github wiki. Perhaps putting `contributors` under the `Code` section of the
main page.
As well as migrating the github wiki, I can think of an addition that might
make various peoples lives easier, a "common issues" page (think issue posted,
instant close, link to part of common issues). There are also some random
pages which could be removed i.e. API reference. Those are two bits and pieces
that come to mind but I'm sure others have more ideas.
It may help sort out miss-communication, speed up reviews and/or ease the
barrier to entry.
I'd be happy to flesh out a first draft but I ain't starting that until I've
got the proper feedback.
