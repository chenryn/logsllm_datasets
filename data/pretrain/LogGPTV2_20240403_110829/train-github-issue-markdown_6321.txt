**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.2

**Background:**
I have been working on integrating the `@typescript-eslint/parser` (previously known as `typescript-eslint-parser`), a TypeScript parser plugin for ESLint, and my current task is to add support for JSX.

ESLint uses `espree` as its default parser, so the goal of this project is to convert the output of the TypeScript compiler (tsc) into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that `espree` can understand. We already have a comprehensive suite of JSX tests (sourced from the `espree` project) to work with, but I encountered a tsc error in one of them.

**Issue:**
It appears that the tsc does not currently accept the "namespaced attribute" syntax in JSX. For example, the following code:

```jsx
<div n:foo={value} />
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The AST produced by `espree` should match the expected structure. You can view the expected AST, particularly the `tokens` array, here:
- [Expected AST](http://astexplorer.net/#/B46lew7I59)

**Actual Behavior:**
The AST generated by the tsc contains parsing issues, as seen in the `parseDiagnostics`. You can view the actual AST here:
- [Actual AST](http://astexplorer.net/#/G5L3CptVNq)

**Workaround:**
Removing the `n:` prefix from `n:foo` resolves the parsing issues. For example:

```jsx
<div foo={value} />
```

This workaround allows the code to be parsed correctly, but it does not address the underlying issue with namespaced attributes in JSX.

If you have any insights or suggestions on how to handle this, please let me know.
