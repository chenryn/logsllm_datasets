 SOAPis a message layout specification that defines
a uniform way of passing XML- encoded data. It also  WSDLis used to describe Web services

Annotation of Web Services

 To enhance the discovery, composition, and
orchestration of Web services, it is necessary to increase
Abstract the description of their interfaces.
Description
 One solution is to annotate WSDL interfaces with
semantic metadata based on relevant ontologies.
Concrete
Description
An ontology is a specification of a representational vocabulary
for a shared domain of discourse.

Semantics at Description Layer How to Annotate ?

Why:  Map Web service’s input & output data as well as
Flow • Unambiguously understand the functionalityof the functional description using relevant data and

Why SOAP? SOAP- Annotation
 Server
 Today's applications communicate using Remote 
Procedure Calls (RPC) between objects like DCOM and Apples
CORBA 
 DDaattaa
 RPC represents a compatibility and security problem;  SSeemmaanntticicss firewalls and proxy servers will normally block this kind of PTTH
traffic. XML
revo
 A better way to communicate between applications is PAOS
over HTTP, because HTTP is supported by all Internet
browsers and servers. SOAP was created to accomplish
this.

be thought of as a DNS for business applications.

How UDDI Works ? Discovery Layers
Publication and Discovery Layers:
1. SW companies, standards 4. Why:
bodies, and programmers • Enable scalable, efficient and dynamic publication and
populate the registry with Flow discovery (machine processable/ automation)
descriptions of different types
of services Marketplaces, search Discovery How:
engines, and business • Use of ontology to categorize registries based on domains
