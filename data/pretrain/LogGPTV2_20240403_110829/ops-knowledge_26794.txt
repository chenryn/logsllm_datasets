User: I'm using Wing IDE, how do I install hypothesis Python package to my computer?
I have already download the zip file, do I use command prompt to install it or there is an option in Wing IDE to do it?
Assistant: pip install hypothesis
Assuming you have pip.
If you want to install it from the downloaded package just open command prompt and  cd to the directory where you downloaded it and do
python setup.py install
