ABSTRACT
LoRa has seen widespread adoption as a long range IoT technology.
As the number of LoRa deployments grow, packet collisions un-
dermine its overall network throughput. In this paper, we propose
a novel interference cancellation technique – Concurrent Inter-
ference Cancellation (CIC), that enables concurrent decoding of
multiple collided LoRa packets. CIC fundamentally differs from
existing approaches as it demodulates symbols by canceling out all
other interfering symbols. It achieves this cancellation by carefully
selecting a set of sub-symbols – pieces of the original symbol such
that no interfering symbol is common across all sub-symbols in
this set. Thus, after demodulating each sub-symbol, an intersection
across their spectra cancels out all the interfering symbols. Through
LoRa deployments using COTS devices, we demonstrate that CIC
can increase the network capacity of standard LoRa by up to 10×
and up to 4× over the state-of-the-art research. While beneficial
across all scenarios, CIC has even more significant benefits under
low SNR conditions that are common to LoRa deployments, in
which prior approaches appear to perform quite poorly.

smart agriculture [4,5], and industrial IoT [6,7]. In a LoRa deploy-
ment, IoT devices, spread across a large spatial extent (several sq.
km.), transmit uplink messages to a LoRa gateway. These messages
are typically transmitted in response to physical sensory events at
unpredictable times. Given their large range, several independently
administered LoRa networks often interfere with each other [8].
Consequently, as LoRa gains popularity, packet collisions in LoRa
networks significantly undermine their capacity [9,10].
LoRa uses Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, where the
data symbols (each data symbol encodes multiple bits) are trans-
mitted as chirps – signals with linearly increasing frequency. Use
of chirps enables long distance communication and provides im-
munity against interference from other transmissions [11]. The
standard Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) LoRa receiver can only
decode one packet at a time. Recently, several research efforts have
attempted to exploit LoRa’s underlying robustness to interference
to resolve collisions, thereby improving network capacity [12–14].
The key contribution of this paper is a novel demodulation tech-
nique, Concurrent Interference Cancellation (CIC)1, that enables de-
coding of multiple colliding packets from COTS LoRa devices. Our
deployments indicate that CIC can increase network capacity by a
factor of 10× compared to LoRa gateways and 4× compared to the
state of the art in research.
1Unlike Successive Interference Cancellation that iteratively decodes and cancels
packets with varying power levels, CIC decodes symbols in parallel, unaffected by
variations in signal power levels.

such that there is no interfering symbol that is common across all
of them. In our example, {𝑟1→2(𝑡), 𝑟3→4(𝑡)} is an ICSS. 𝑟1→2(𝑡)
experiences interference from symbols {𝐶2
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣}, since none
of the interfering transmissions have crossed their respective sym-
bol boundaries. Similarly, 𝑟3→4(𝑡) experiences interference from
symbols {𝐶2
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡}, since all of the interfering transmissions
have crossed their respective symbol boundaries. The only com-
mon symbol to both sub-symbols is 𝐶1 and there are no common
interfering symbols.

CIC then de-chirps each of the sub-symbols in the ICSS by com-
puting an FFT. There will be no interfering frequency peak that
is common across all these FFTs, since they have no common in-
terfering symbol by construction. Next, CIC performs a spectral
intersection (Section 5.2) of all these FFTs which is an equivalent
of set intersection for spectra. This operation removes all the in-
terfering symbol frequencies, leaving behind only one frequency
corresponding to the symbol to be decoded, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
Choosing shorter time-span sub-symbols however, comes with a
drawback. Heisenberg’s Time-Frequency uncertainty principle [17]
dictates that using shorter time-span windows will adversely effect
frequency resolution in the FFT. At lower resolutions, cancellation
is harder as close peaks merge or overlap with one another. Thus,
different choices of ICSS provide different levels of cancellation.
Since 𝑟1→2(𝑡) and 𝑟3→4(𝑡) each have a small time span, this choice
does not provide the best cancellation. As described in Section 5,
guided by the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, CIC chooses the
optimal ICSS that maximizes the cancellation.
In cases where two or more of the interfering transmissions are
received at a high power and have symbol boundaries close in time
and in constituent frequencies, CIC may only be able to cancel
them partially. To resolve such cases we propose a novel technique,
Spectral Edge Difference (SED), that relies on the property that
while the constituent frequency of the symbol being decoded will
be present at both ends of the symbol, this will not be true for
interfering transmissions. We find that using additional features
unique to each transmitter, such as Carrier Frequency Offset (as
proposed in [14]) and received signal power (as employed in [16])
to filter possible candidates improves performance.
We have implemented CIC-based decoding as a python library,
and also in Matlab, all available at 2. A key feature of CIC is that it
can be decoded symbol-by-symbol for each transmission indepen-
dently, making it extremely parallalizable and amenable to efficient
multi-threaded implementation. We have tested the efficacy of CIC
in various indoor and outdoor environments, while comparing its
performance to standard LoRa as well as prior state of the art. Our
deployment tests indicate that CIC significantly outperforms ex-
isting techniques in both high SNR scenarios as well in large area
deployments where the received signal strength can be close or
even under the noise floor.
In summary, we make the following contributions.
• We propose a novel LoRa demodulation technique, Concur-
rent Interference Cancellation (CIC), that can decode multiple
concurrent LoRa transmissions by canceling symbols from in-
terfering transmissions.

Fig 3: An example illustration of CIC
A standard LoRa receiver “de-chirps” each received symbol by
multiplying it with a down-chirp, a chirp of linearly decreasing
frequency. De-chirping converts a LoRa symbol into a sinusoid
with a fixed frequency, unique to that symbol. Fourier transform
(FFT) is then used to identify this frequency and hence the symbol.
Figure 1 illustrates the decoding of symbol 𝐶1 of a collision-free
transmission (Tx 1), whose de-chirping generates a sinusoid of
frequency 𝑓 1.
In a multi-packet collision, the received signal is a superposi-
tion of several interfering transmissions. De-chirping the received
symbol 𝑟(𝑡), results in a superposition of multiple sinusiods (in-
stead of one), each with a frequency corresponding to one of the
interfering symbols. An FFT of this received symbol then results
in a clutter of multiple frequencies. The standard LoRa receiver is
unable to determine which of these frequencies corresponds to that
of the symbol being decoded. Figure 2 illustrates this for a 3 packet
collision scneario.
Existing techniques treat multi-packet collision decoding as a
matching problem, where detected peaks are matched to their corre-
sponding transmitters (as discussed in Section 2) based on features
unique to symbols originating from a single transmitter. Choir [14]
exploits the uniqueness of the transmitters’ Carrier Frequency Off-
sets (CFO), mLoRa [15] and CoLoRa [16] group symbols based on
the similarity in their received power levels. FTrack [12] groups
symbols based on their start times using a sliding STFT.
CIC takes a distinct approach to multi-packet collision decoding.
Rather than treating it as a symbol-to-transmitter matching problem,
it cancels out all interfering symbol frequencies, leaving behind only
a single frequency peak, that of the symbol being decoded (Figure 2).
In order to achieve this cancellation, CIC exploits variations in
spectral content across various sub-parts of the symbol.
For every interfering transmission Tx 𝑖, as it transitions across its
symbol boundary, the previous interfering symbol 𝐶𝑖
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑣 is replaced
by the next interfering symbol 𝐶𝑖
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡. Between any two interfering
symbol transitions however, the set of interfering symbols does
not change. Based on this observation, CIC defines sub-symbols i.e.
pieces of 𝑟(𝑡), whose boundaries align with symbol boundaries of
transmissions. CIC determines these boundaries by determining
the start of each received LoRa packet using preamble detection.
Since symbol duration is known for a LoRa network, we extrapolate
the start of each packet to determine the corresponding symbol
boundary. For example, in Figure 3, 𝑟1→2(𝑡) represents the part of
𝑟(𝑡) from the start of 𝐶1 to the start of 𝐶2
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 and 𝑟3→4(𝑡) from the
start of 𝐶3
𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 to the end of 𝐶1. CIC then selects the Interference
Cancelling Sub-Symbols Set (ICSS), a set of different sub-symbols,

• Through several indoor and outdoor deployments using COTS
devices we show that CIC significantly outperforms LoRa (10×)
as well as state of the art collision decoding techniques.
• We provide python as well as Matlab implementations of CIC
for public use.
2 RELATED WORK
As discussed in Section 1, during a packet collision, a LoRa decoder
sees multiple peaks instead of one (Figure 2), each corresponding to
an interfering symbol. The approach taken by all existing works has
been to match and group all discovered symbols to their corresponding
transmitters based on certain features common to them.
Choir [14] exploits the fact that different transmitters have differ-
ent Carrier Frequency Offsets (CFO) and groups symbols with the
most similar CFOs. FTrack [12] generates time-frequency tracks of
the various symbols in the received signal by employing sliding win-
dow Short Term Fourier Transforms (STFT) on the de-chirped signal.
It uses a fixed window size of one symbol duration while sliding,
due to which FTrack achieves best possible frequency resolution at
the cost of worst time resolution. FTrack performs well in high SNR
scenarios but its accuracy degrades in low SNR since its thresholds
fail to extract accurate frequency tracks from a noisy spectrogram.
Moreover, sliding the window sample by sample incurs computa-
tional overheads. Following FTrack, more recent works have also
leveraged the packet structure and cyclicity of CSS to estimate the
start of a message and decode multiple packets from the collided
signal [13,16]. mLoRa [15] and CoLoRa [16] group symbols based
on the similarity in their received power levels. mLoRa proposes
a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique that itera-
tively assigns the highest powered symbols to a single transmission
and then removes them from consideration for the next iteration.
CoLoRa [16] groups symbols with similar peak(power) ratios across
windows to a transmission with the assumption that the received
power is consistent throughout the packet. NScale [13] focuses on
collision resolution in low-SNR conditions using non-stationary
scaling to match data symbols to packets. NScale achieves the sym-
bol error rate of FTrack over a range of SNRs.
In contrast to past approaches, CIC cancels out the interference by
combining spectra obtained from different parts within each symbol.
One of the major differences between existing works and CIC is
the use of temporal variation of spectral content of a single symbol.
Majority of the existing works use a fixed, large window size to
perform FFT; although that leads to high frequency resolution,
longer windows have limited time resolution. Therefore, timing
information of interfering symbols is unavailable in current works.
