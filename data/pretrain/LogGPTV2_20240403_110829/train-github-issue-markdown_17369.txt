Hello,
This is more of a question than a bug report.
Is there documentation on how to use iCloud to sync data in Electron?
(Preferably in a way that can be implemented using auto-save without user
input)
Iâ€™ve searched the issues for any mention of iCloud and have also done a Google
search. This seems like something that should have documentation since a
desktop app may need to share data with a mobile app over iCloud.
