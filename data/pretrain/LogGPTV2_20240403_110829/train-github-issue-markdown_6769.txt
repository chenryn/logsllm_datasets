    The FreeBSD builder sporadically fails with (among other things) EADDRINUSE errors.
    e.g.
    Change 4e18f60442c2 broke the freebsd-386 build:
    http://godashboard.appspot.com/log/c55befefa54d803c1b6327356ac0db98109203d2f462e9efb547462e7cc3f948
    ... shows a net.Dial failing.
    This test program (attached) will reproduce it after a few tries on a 64-bit FreeBSD
    8.0-RELEASE-p4 box:
    [bradfitz@ch ~]$ ./stress
