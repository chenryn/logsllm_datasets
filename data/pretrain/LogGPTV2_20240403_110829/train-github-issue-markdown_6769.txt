The FreeBSD builder occasionally fails, with one of the common errors being EADDRINUSE. For instance, the commit 4e18f60442c2 disrupted the freebsd-386 build. A detailed log can be found at: [http://godashboard.appspot.com/log/c55befefa54d803c1b6327356ac0db98109203d2f462e9efb547462e7cc3f948](http://godashboard.appspot.com/log/c55befefa54d803c1b6327356ac0db98109203d2f462e9efb547462e7cc3f948). The log indicates a failure in the `net.Dial` function.

To reproduce this issue, you can run the attached test program (stress.go) on a 64-bit FreeBSD 8.0-RELEASE-p4 system. After several attempts, the following error messages may appear:

```
