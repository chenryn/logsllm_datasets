User: How to manage multiple hosts through Ansible?
Assistant: Multiple hosts can be managed through Ansible using Inventory files. The inventory file is a list of Ansible host inventories that lists all hosts and properties to be managed. The following is an example of an Inventory file: ``` [webservers] web1.example.com web2.example.com web3.example.com [dbservers] db1.example.com db2.example.com ``` can be passed in the Inventory file Define host groups and names in to organize hosts. Host groups can be used to target specific tasks to a group of hosts. For example, we could define a hostgroup called "webservers" and add all web servers to it. Hosts can be managed using Ansible ad-hoc commands (ad hoc single commands) or playbooks (ordered collections of Ansible tasks). Ansible uses SSH to connect to each host listed in the inventory and perform the specified action. Here is an example of a simple Playbook that runs a command and returns output on multiple hosts: ``` --- - name: Run command on hosts hosts: webservers gather_facts: False tasks: - name: run command shell: hostname register: output - debug: var: output.stdout_lines ``` This Playbook will run the command "hostname" on the "webservers" hostgroup and record its output as a variable in "output", and finally use the debug module output Output the result. Using tools such as Ansible Tower and AWX can manage multiple hosts more conveniently, such as providing graphical interface, automatic operation and other functions.
