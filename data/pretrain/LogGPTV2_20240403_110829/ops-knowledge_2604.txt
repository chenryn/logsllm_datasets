User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题AWS - Is it safe to remove ec2-user? I'm using Amazon Linux AMI.

When you create EC2 instance, by default the username is ec2-user.

I want to create another user (lets say user1) with the same privileges as ec2-user, and I want to delete ec2-user. Is it safe to delete the ec2-user?

Can you provide me linux commands how to do this please?

Sorry I'm noob when it comes to linux commands.

Assistant: The steps to create a user with the same rights as ec2-user are:


create the account


useradd NEWACCOUNT

set a password for the account


passwd NEWACCOUNT

add the account to the sudo group


usermod -aG sudo NEWACCOUNT

log in with the account


su - NEWACCOUT

create a .ssh directory


mkdir .ssh

log out of NEWACCOUNT


exit

now you are back in root, copy the authorized_keys file, and set security on .ssh


cp /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/NEWACCOUNT/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 /home/NEWACCOUNT/.ssh 



Log all the way out of the system, and try and log in with the NEWACCOUNT. 

Once logged in invoke sudo su to ensure it has the correct rights. You should get an error message.

The last step is to replace ec2-user with NEWACCOUNT in the file:


/etc/sudoers.d/cloud-init


The easiest way is with the nano editor, but there are many other editors in linux. 

If this works, then you have a new account with the same priviledges as the ec2-user (and you have also removed ec2-user from the ability to become root) and can safely delete (or ignore) that account.
