Walking	into	a	brick	and	mortar	store		
everyone	sees	the	same	price,	be	it	for	fresh	vegetable	or	a	pair	of	jeans

Naviga=ng	into	an	e-commerce	store	
what	User	A	sees	…	is	not	what	User	B	gets.	
User	A	
User	B	
Even	more	interes=ngly,	you	have	no	easy	way	of	knowing	that	others	see	diﬀerent	prices.	
The	reason	is	…

An	e-commerce	store	is	like	Star	Trek’s	holodeck	
each	one	can	have	a	diﬀerent	world	painted	around	him		
(	+	he	cannot	see	into	neighboring	worlds	)

		Enter	the	Price	$heriﬀ	
A	ﬁrst-of-its-kind	transparency	soMware	that		
allows	one	to	see	the	prices	as	seen	by	others	
A	ﬁrst	small	step	towards	looking	behind	and	through	the	matrix

Why	is	$heriﬀ	interes=ng?	
Had	to	solve	some	diﬃcult	technical	challenges:	
• 	Build	a	P2P	proxy	network	
• 	Prevent	user	proﬁle	pollu=on	(Browser	and	Server	side)	
• 	Protect	user	privacy	
• 	Perform	universal	price	extrac=on	
• 	Automate	currency	detec=on	
Gathered	lots	of	interes=ng	measurements:	
• 	More	than	2000	e-commerce	sites,	
• 	Including	the	top	400	according	to	Alexa	
• 	More	than	6000	products	
• 	More	than	1500	real	users	in	55	countries	
• 	More	than	0.7	million	measurement	points
