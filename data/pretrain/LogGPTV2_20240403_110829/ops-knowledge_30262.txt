User: Having an issue with Docker at the moment; I'm using it to run an image that launches an ipython notebook on startup. I'm looking to make some edits to ipython notebook itself, so I need to close it after launch.
However, hitting CTRL+C in the terminal just inputs "^C" as a string. There seems to be no real way of using CTRL+C to actually close the ipython notebook instance.
Would anyone have any clues as to what can cause this, or know of any solutions for it?
Assistant: @maybeg's answer already explains very well why this might be happening.
Regarding stopping the unresponsive container, another solution is to simply issue a docker stop <container-id> in another terminal. As opposed to CTRL-C, docker stop does not send a SIGINT  but a SIGTERM signal, to which the process might react differently.

Usage: docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
Stop a running container by sending SIGTERM and then SIGKILL after a grace period

If that fails, use docker kill <container-id> which sends a SIGKILL immediately.
