When you create an index it would be good to be able to specify a date that it
could be auto-deleted on. Either a fixed, hard coded date or a parameter in
how many days before deleting. We are using ELK for monitoring of a lot of
production actiivity and the indices can get very big. Auto-deletion is a very
attractive possible feature.
