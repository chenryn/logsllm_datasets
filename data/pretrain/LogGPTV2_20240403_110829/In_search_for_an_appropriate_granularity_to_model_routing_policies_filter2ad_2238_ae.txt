### Path Choices and Internet Routing

A non-negligible fraction of path choices in the Internet do not correspond to simple per-neighbor preferences. Instead, they are influenced by hot-potato routing and tie-breaking within the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) decision process. These are intricate aspects of Internet routing.

### Contributions and Future Work

This paper represents a significant step toward developing a model that can predict AS (Autonomous System) paths under various "what-if" scenarios. In future work, we will validate the policies derived from this model by testing their predictive capabilities and comparing them with actual policies configured by ASs, as discussed in [26].

### Appendix: Relationship Inference

Previous work on inferring AS business relationships (e.g., [5]) relies on two main assumptions. First, there is a unique business contract negotiated between any two ASs. The relationship associated with any directed link in the AS topology is one of the following: peer-to-peer, customer-to-provider (C2P), or provider-to-customer (P2C). Second, routes received by an AS from any of its providers or peer-to-peer neighbors cannot be propagated to any other provider or peer-to-peer neighbor. This property is known as the "valley-free" property.

Inferring business relationships can be formulated as the MaxTOR problem [12]. Given a set of AS paths, assign a unique label to each link in the AS topology such that the number of valley-free paths is maximized. MaxTOR is an NP-complete problem, and many heuristics have been developed to tackle it due to its complexity. As reported in [27], if a solution to MaxTOR with \( n \) business relationships exists (optimal or not), then there are at least \( 3^n \) different solutions leading to the same number of valley-free paths. This means that any given solution has a very small probability of being realistic, even if it produces the exact maximum number of valley-free paths.

As inferred relationships can produce up to 99% of observed valley-free paths, the propagation of observed paths remains possible in an AS topology model when relationship filters are incorporated. However, due to the exponential number of solutions with the same number of valley-free paths, there is significant freedom in the choice of relationship filters. Many approaches have tackled the MaxTOR problem by splitting each path into AS triples. From these approaches, we selected four:

- **gao [5]**: The greedy approach recognizes valley-free AS paths using sequences of AS degrees in paths. When valleys occur in AS paths, some conflicting relationships are assumed to support a mutual-transit relationship (labeled "SIB").
- **sark [12]**: This algorithm uses topology leaf-pruning as seen from each observation point to infer per-vantage-point AS rankings. Then, a relationship for each link is inferred. When the ranking of ASs is not decisive enough, some links are labeled with the "Unknown" relation.
- **csp [23]**: This approach leverages the Constraint Satisfaction framework. A Max2CSP problem is derived from MaxTOR, where each relation is a variable, and each sub-path of length 2 (AS triples) introduces a constraint between two relations. A tabu-search algorithm runs on a restricted space of feasible solutions (unlikely relations and customer cycles are forbidden).
- **caida [26]**: Another recent algorithm claims to find more realistic solutions with partial validation of the results. The objective function to maximize in the MaxTOR problem is modified to incorporate information on the degree of ASs. This mathematical program is solved using Semi-Definite Programming and then uses a post-processing heuristic to maximize the number of peering links.

#### Datasets Used to Infer Business Relationships

| Dataset | Vertices | Links | Triples | Variables | Constraints |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Full    | 4,681,770 | 21,169 | 1,972,727 | 21,016 | 54,193 | 4,718 |
| RIPE    | 58,911 | 965,859 | 48,162 | 415,523 | 46,489 | 1,673 |
| Route-Views | 1,682,568 | 21,060 | 47,170 | 476,668 | 45,197 | 1,973 |

Our full dataset contains twice as many unique AS paths as the RIPE or Route-views subsets but approximately the same number of ASs and only 20% more AS relationships. It includes roughly twice as many sub-paths of length 2 (AS triples) as the two subsets. Additional input paths increase the difficulty of MaxTOR and make it more restrictive on potential solutions. Despite this, many solutions maximizing the same number of valley-free paths exist. We now evaluate the solutions produced by the different algorithms.

#### Evaluation of Solutions Provided by Algorithms

| Algorithm | Peer Links | C2P Links | SIB/UNK Links | Valley-Free Paths (%) | CAIDA-Match (%) | Tier-1-Match (%) |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| sark      | 25,688     | 13,786    | 5,200         | 81.5                 | 70.5            | 96.1             |
| gao       | 15,630     | 12,971    | 5,361         | 100.0                | 73.0            | 99.3             |
| caida     | 18,326     | 9,219     | 3,367         | 99.9                 | 84.6            | 92.6             |
| csp       | 32,703     | 34,006    | 3,8128        | 100.0                | 85.5            | 94.5             |

The sark algorithm produces a small number of valley-free paths (see Table 7). However, the solutions match well with the relationships from the tier-1 (about 80%). The gao heuristic has 100% of valley-free paths, but it determines an unrealistically large number of mutual-transit relationships. The caida solution, though not produced using our datasets, evaluates well on each dataset, producing a large number of valley-free paths (more than 96%) and a good match with the relationships of the tier-1 (80%). Finally, the csp heuristic produces solutions with the largest number of valley-free paths (up to 99%) and the best match with the relationships of our tier-1 (about 94%).

Only the solutions provided by the csp and gao algorithms are close to the caida one. Since some solutions of the caida algorithm have been validated using information about business relationships of many ASs, we consider those produced by csp as realistic enough for our goal. Therefore, we rely on the csp algorithm to run our model of path propagation, due to its potential accuracy and large number of valley-free paths.
