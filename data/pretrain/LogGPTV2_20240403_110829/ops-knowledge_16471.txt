User: Please describe common cyber attack types and defense strategies, and explain their role in IT operations.
Assistant: Common network attack types and defense strategies are as follows: 1. DDoS attack: Send traffic to the server through a large number of forged requests, making it unable to process normal requests, thereby paralyzing the target website or system. Defense strategies include: using firewalls, DDoS protection services, and load balancers to filter requests, limit traffic, and maintain system availability. 2. Phishing attack: a fraudulent act of pretending to be a legitimate organization or person, and tricking users into providing sensitive information by forging web pages, emails or information. Defensive strategies include: training employees to increase security awareness, using anti-phishing technology to filter mail, verifying website security and other measures. 3. Malware attack: Refers to malicious software such as illegal programs or viruses invading the system, manipulating or destroying normal operation. Defense strategies include: using anti-virus software, firewalls and updating system patches and other measures to strengthen information security management and encrypt sensitive data. 4. System vulnerability attack: use system vulnerability to attack the system, obtain sensitive information or manipulate the system. Defense strategies include: keeping system and software updated, strengthening security audit and system monitoring, using encryption technology to prevent information leakage, etc. The above attack types and defense strategies play a vital role in IT operation and maintenance. Ensuring the security and stability of system and network operation, and preventing information leakage and data loss are one of the key tasks of operation and maintenance. Only by taking a large number of preventive measures and strengthening information security management can we effectively resist various network attacks and protect the interests of enterprises and users.
