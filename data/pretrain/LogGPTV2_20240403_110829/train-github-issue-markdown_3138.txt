A comprehensive tutorial should be developed, covering not only the basics of using Flask but also delving into several key extensions and modules. This would include, but not be limited to, Flask-Script for handling command-line interfaces, Flask-SQLAlchemy for integrating with SQL databases, and Flask-WTF for managing web forms. Additionally, the tutorial should explore other relevant components or what may be termed as "modules" in the future.
