User: The predominant ORMs that run in a linux-based environment seem to be written around a specific language.
Microsoft LINQ, however, supports access from a number of languages.  Can I do this in linux-land (i.e. non-LINQ-land, non-JVM-land), for example between native versions of Python and Ruby?
Assistant: It seems that the only way to do this is to use languages which share a common VM, such as .NET CLR (and LINQ) or the Java JVM (Hibernate, Eclipse Link, etc).
So for the various languages running in their native implementation, the answer is no.
