APPENDIX
A. QUALITATIVE COMPARISON
As opposed to tulip [30], cing [11], Pong [17] and
TSLP [28], the main beneﬁts of our proposal are its
compliance with current router functionalities, its ro-
bust statistical analysis and the recycling of existing
data.
All techniques, including ours, require routers send-
ing back ICMP packets for TTL-expired packets.
In
addition, TSLP requires routers to implement IP op-
15
tions (pre-speciﬁed timestamps or record route). Tulip
and cing require routers to implement ICMP Times-
tamp and have strong assumptions for IP ID imple-
mentation.
In addition to these restrictions, some techniques have
coverage limits. Pong can only monitor paths between
probes, TSLP considers only inter-domain symmetric
links adjacent to the probes’ ASs, and our system is
constrained to links monitored by probes from at least
3 diﬀerent ASs.
Finally, tulip and cing are consuming signiﬁcantly
more network resources than other methods. These two
methods rely on ICMP timestamps and require a large
number of samples to correct routers’ clocks artifacts.
Consequently, the authors of tulip estimate delays on a
path using 1000 measurements per router plus an extra
500 measurements per router for packet loss estimation
[30]. In contrast, our system requires as little as nine
packets per router and is designed to take advantage
of existing traceroute data, thus really adding no extra
load to the network.
B. THEORETICAL LIMITATIONS
The sensitivity of our approach ino detecting abnor-
mal delay changes depends mainly on the size of the
time bin which is based on probes deployment and prob-
ing rate. A link is monitored only if it is traversed from
vantage points within at least three diﬀerent ASs (Sec-
tion 4.3). As traceroute sends three packets per hop, for
a link we expect at least m = 3∗ 3 packets per time bin.
Consequently, the number of vantage points monitoring
a link and their probing rate r (i.e. number of tracer-
outes per hour) determine the minimum usable time bin
Tmin = m
3rn . Intuitively experiments with many probes
or a high probing rate would permit the use of short
time bin.
Let T ≥ Tmin be the selected time bin, then 3rnT is
the expected number of packets obtained for a link per
time bin. Because our approach relies on the median,
50% of these packets should be impacted by an event
to be detected. In other words, an event is detected if
it aﬀects more than 1 + 3rnT
packets within a time bin.
Consequently, the smallest detectable event in hour is:
2
1
3rn
(1 +
3rnT
2
) =
1
3rn
+
T
2
.
(11)
In Section 7 we analyze builtin measurements which
initiate traceroute every 30 minutes (r = 2 traceroutes
per hour) thus the minimum usable time bin is Tmin =
0.5 hour. In our experiments we conservatively set the
time bin T = 1 hour, hence, according to Equation 11,
the shortest event we can detect for a link monitored by
three vantage points (n = 3) is 33 minutes. Because of
the higher probing rate of anchoring measurements (r =
4), one could detect events lasting only nine minutes
with this dataset.
