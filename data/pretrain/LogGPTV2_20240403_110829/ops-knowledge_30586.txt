I encountered an issue while attempting to install OpenStack. After running the `stack.sh` script, I received an error upon exit. Upon reviewing the log, it appears that the problem occurred during the execution of the following command:

```bash
sudo -H -E python /home/sagar/devstack/files/get-pip.py
```

The specific error message was:

```
Collecting pip
  Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement pip
  No distributions at all found for pip
++ err_trap
++ local r=1
```

After investigating, I discovered that the issue was due to an incorrect system date.
