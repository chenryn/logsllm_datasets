User: In Ansible, how to manage the automated deployment and operation and maintenance of the entire IT infrastructure? Please explain with actual cases.
Assistant: Ansible is an IT automation-based tool that can centrally manage the automated deployment, configuration, and operation and maintenance of the entire IT infrastructure from a central location. Tasks such as large-scale server management, software deployment, configuration management, and application operation and maintenance can be achieved using Ansible. The following is a practical case to explain how to use Ansible to manage the automated deployment and operation and maintenance of the entire IT infrastructure. Case background Assume that a company has a large number of servers and applications that require frequent deployment and maintenance. However, these servers and applications are scattered in different places, and each server has a different operating system and configuration, making unified management and operation and maintenance difficult. In order to solve this problem, the company decided to use Ansible for automated deployment and operation and maintenance. Deployment and configuration management First, we need to install Ansible on the core server and configure basic settings. Then, we need to write Ansible Playbooks to tell Ansible how to deploy and configure servers. An Ansible Playbook is a script that contains a series of tasks and instructions. For example, we can write a Playbook to install and configure Apache server. The following is a simple Playbook example to install Apache: ``` --- - name: Install Apache hosts: webservers become: true tasks: - name: Install Apache yum: name: httpd state: present - name: Start Apache service: name: httpd state: started ``` In this Playbook, we define a task list, including two tasks "Install Apache" and "Start Apache". We use the "yum" command to install the Apache package, and then use the "service" command to start the Apache service. After writing the Playbooks, we can run the specific Playbook by entering the following command on the command line: ``` $ ansible-playbook playbook.yml ``` Operation and monitoring In addition to deployment and configuration management, Ansible can also be used for operation Peacekeeping monitoring. For example, we can use Ansible to check the server's CPU usage and disk space usage and other indicators, and then compare these indicators with the threshold defined in advance to detect whether there is a problem. The following is a simple Playbook example to check server CPU usage and disk space usage: ``` --- - name: Monitor Server Metrics hosts: webservers tasks: - name: Check CPU Usage shell: "sar -u 1 5 | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $8}'" register: cpu_usage - name: Check Disk Usage shell: "df -h | grep '/dev/sda1' | awk '{print $5}' | sed ' s/%//g'" register: disk_usage - name: Notify Admin If High Usage debug: msg: "CPU Usage: {{ cpu_usage.stdout }}% Disk Usage: {{ disk_usage.stdout }}%" when: cpu_usage .stdout|int > 70 or disk_usage.stdout|int > 80 ``` In this Playbook, we used the "shell" command to run the "sar -u" and "df -h" commands to get the CPU usage and Disk space usage. We then save these values into variables using the "register" directive, and finally output the values using the "debug" directive. If the CPU usage is greater than 70% or the disk space usage is greater than 80%, use the "when" command to send an alert message to the administrator. Summary By using Ansible, we can automate deployment and operation and maintenance, and improve the stability and reliability of IT infrastructure. Ansible can help us achieve server management, software deployment, configuration management, automated testing and monitoring in a fast, accurate and repeatable way.
