User: I'm trying to pass a variable from one page to another using google app engine, I know how to pass it using GET put putting it in the URL.  But I would like to keep the URL clean, and I might need to pass a larger amount of data, so how can pass info using post.
To illustrate, I have a page with a series of links, each goes to /viewTaskGroup.html, and I want to pass the name of the group I want to view based on which link they click (so I can search and get it back and display it), but I'd rather not use GET if possible.
I didn't think any code is required, but if you need any I'm happy to provide any needed.
Assistant: Links inherently generate GET requests. If you want to generate a POST request, you'd need to either:

Use a form with method="POST" and submit it, or
Use AJAX to load the new page.
