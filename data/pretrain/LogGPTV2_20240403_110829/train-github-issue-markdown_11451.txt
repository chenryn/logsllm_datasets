Hello,
we moved recently from TS 1.4 to TS 1.5 with Visual Studio 2013.
When we have the following class definition:
    export class ErrorClass {
        public foo({bar: number}) { }
    }
With the Option "Generate declaration files" and "combine javascript output
into file" to true, the resulting declaration for this file will be:
    class ErrorClass {
        foo({bar: }: {
            bar: any;
        }): void;
    }
Which is syntactically incorrect: The first "bar" is missing the type
specifier (and is of type number instead of any).
This will cause that projects using this declaration file fails to compile.
Can anyone reproduce this? Is there a fix available?
Kind regards,  
Timo
