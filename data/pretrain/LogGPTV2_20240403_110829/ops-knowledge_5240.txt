User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题login page permission has changed suspiciously I have developed a website with php and apache server on linux centos
I am not professional on security issues and I think some folks try to hack my website
first please advice me which security things I should follow

but my problem:
tonight as I tried to login firebug showed it tries to load login.php for serveral times but a file error occurs (I think a permanent move or something....)
anyway when I checked the login.php file in linux I have noticed the file permission has been changed and all x (execution) flags has been removed.

could it be the work of a hacker? what should I do to prevent such happening.

I changed chown to root, and also set chmod of all files from 775 to 755
please give more

Assistant: In a situation like this, the first thing I would do is check the Apache log files. There should be an access_log as well as an error_log file(s). It should give you a clue as to possibly the source and what was done, if anything.

The logs are usually found in:


  /etc/httpd/log/


The second thing I would do, if you think the script was changed, is to compare it for differences with a backup copy (that you know is secure and has not been tampered with).
