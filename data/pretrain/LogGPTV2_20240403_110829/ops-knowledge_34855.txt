User: I am using Python Kafka topic.
Is there any provision producer that can update a message in a queue in Kafka and append it to the top of queue again?
According to spec of Kafka, it doesn't seems feasible.
Assistant: Kafka is a distributed immutable commit log. That said, there is no possibility to update a message in a topic. Once it is there all you can do is consume it, update and produce to another (or this) topic again
