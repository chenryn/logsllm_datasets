### Title: Black Hat US-19 HostSplit: Exploitable Antipatterns in Unicode Normalization

This presentation introduces novel exploit techniques that leverage Unicode normalization behavior to bypass URL security filters. In some cases, these attacks allow one domain to impersonate another. Unlike previous attacks on internationalized domain names (IDNs), which relied on visual spoofing, these new methods deceive software by presenting URL strings that are parsed as belonging to one hostname but resolved as a different one.

The vulnerabilities enabling these attacks are widespread due to practical compromises in the implementation of IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names for Applications) standards. The presenter has identified several new CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to these issues, including vulnerabilities in Edge/IE, .NET, Python, Java, Office 365, and Gmail. Additionally, a more general exploit pattern targeting OAuth is also discussed.

While some platform-level issues have been addressed, many of the necessary fixes will need to be implemented at the application level. It is likely that numerous software packages still contain Unicode normalization vulnerabilities of this type. This talk will cover methods for testing for these vulnerabilities and provide coding and design best practices to prevent them.
