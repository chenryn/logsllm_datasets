4.4 Metrics and Score
In this section, the search for secondary factors that have an impact on the
understandability of process models is described. As explained in Section 3.2,
we take a wide range of potential factors into consideration. To determine their
power to explain variations in model understandability, we established for each
model its average score (computed over the 73 respondents) and determined
Pearson correlation coefficients with all potential factors.
From the correlation coefficients, only the signs of #or joins, density,
average connector degree, mismatch, and connector heterogenity
correspond with the hypothesized influences as given in Table 1. However, only
the correlation coefficients of density and average connector degree are
significant at a 95% confidence level (see Table 2).

Todeeperexaminethevalueofthedistinguishedfactorsinexplainingdiffer-
ences in score, we developed various linear regression models – even though it
should be noted that the number of 12 different model observations is quite low
for this purpose. We compared all 31 (= 25 −1) linear regression models that
take a non-empty subset into account of the factors shown in Table 2. To dif-
ferentiate between the regression models, we used the adjusted R2 statistic that
measures how the variability in the score is explained by each model. Within
this setting, no multivariate regression model had acceptable t-values.

that uses average connector degree – one of the factors that correlates
significantly with average score. For this regression model, the Durbin-Watson
statistic value indicates that there is no serial autocorrelation in the residuals
at the 95% confidence level. In Figure 6 a plot is shown of the fitted model

As stated, the number of models is too small to make strong claims. Still,
fromthefactors consideredweseethat thetwofactors whichmost convincingly
relate to model understandability both concern the number of arcs in a process
model. The average connector degree measures the model’s average of
incoming/outcoming arcs per routing element, while density gives the ratio of

4.5 Expert interviews
To validate our results, we interviewed 12 professional process modellers on the
insights gained from our questionnaire. On average this group possessed over
10 years of expertise in developing process models, mainly for documentation
purposes, but most had experience with enactment models as well. The profes-
sionals are employed in 7 different companies, four of which being consultancy
firms, two financials, and one utilities company.
With respect to personal factors, the experts emphasized the value of sub-
jects’ analytical skills and visual perceptiveness to understand process models.
Asidefromthesementalfaculties,bothmodelingexperienceandfamiliaritywith
the modeling technique at hand were mentioned often as being of positive influ-
ence. While the former aspect is explicitly confirmed by the findings from our
questionnaire, we have no direct support for the second aspect.
Next, we asked the experts whether users are capable of assessing their own
ability to understand process models. Half of the experts predominantly thought
so, while the others predominantly thought the opposite. In the former group,
modelingexperienceandfamiliaritywiththemodelingtechniquewerementioned
by almost all as important conditional factors. One of the experts from the
lattergroupindicatedthat“peopletendtooverestimatethemselves,particularly

determinewhetheramodeliscompletelycorrect.Theimageemergesthatproper

least, which is consistent with our findings.
Finally,expertsindicatedadecreasingrelevanceof(a)model-relatedfactors,
(b) person-related factors, and (c) domain knowledge for the understanding of
process models. The model-related factors that were mentioned most as pos-
itively influencing model understandability: unambiguity (7 times), simplicity
(4 times), structuredness (4 times) and modularity (4 times). From the less-
mentioned factors, the supposed positive effects of textual support is interesting
tomention,i.e.well-chosentextualdescriptionsofmodelelements(3times)and
textual context information on the model in general (3 times). Part of the fac-
tors mentioned seem to overlap with the factors considered in this study (e.g.
simplicity and structuredness), while others are food for further research (e.g.
modularity and textual support).
5 Conclusions
We set out with this research to develop a better insight into the factors that
makeprocessmodelsunderstandableforhumans.Fromthesixresearchquestions
inSection3,wefocusedontherelationsbetweenpersonalandmodelcharacter-
istics (questions 1 and 2). Our findings suggest that personal factors indeed in-
fluencetheabilitytounderstandprocessmodels.Inparticular,itseemsthatthe
amount of theoretical modeling knowledge of the subjects may play a role here.
At the same time, our respondents were not capable of a proper self-assessment
with respect to their modeling proficiency. With respect to the model charac-
teristics, our findings from the questionnaire seem to underline the insight that
model size is of dominant importance on model understandability. Yet, small
variations between models can lead to significant differences in their compre-
hensibility.Thismeansthatsecondaryexplanatoryfactorsarestillmissingfrom
the picture. From our analysis of a wide set of candidate factors, the average
connector degree is the most convincing factor that relates to model under-
standability, followed by a model’s density. Both factors point at the negative
effect of a relatively high number of arcs on a model’s understandability.
To counter the potentially limited validity of an experiment involving stu-
dents,weinterviewed anumberofexperiencedprocessmodelers.Theiropinions

tors to investigate. Our research is characterized by other limitations, in partic-
ularthesmallsetofmodelsbeingconsideredandthelimitedsetofparticipants.
With larger sets in future replications of the experiment, we can investigate the
impact of secondary factors in greater detail. The other directions for future re-
search followlogicallyfromtheresearchquestionswedidnotaddressyet.While
we tried to neutralize the influences of the modeling purpose, knowledge of the
domain, modeling language, and layout strategy, these are all issues that need
further exploration.
