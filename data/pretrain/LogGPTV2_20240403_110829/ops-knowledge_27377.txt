User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to watch for count of new lines in tail I want to do something like this:

watch tail -f | wc -l
#=&gt; 43
#=&gt; 56
#=&gt; 61
#=&gt; 44
#=&gt; ...


It counts new lines of tail each second

/ Linux, CentOs

To be more clear. I have got something like this:

tail -f /var/log/my_process/*.log | grep error


I am reading some error messages. And now I want to count them. How many ~ errors I have got in a second. So one line in a log is one error in a proccess.

Assistant: I've recently discovered pv, and it's really cool, you could do something like

tail -f logfile | pv -i2 -ltr &gt; /dev/null


-i2 = count every 2 seconds
-l  = count lines
-t  = print time
-r  = show rate
