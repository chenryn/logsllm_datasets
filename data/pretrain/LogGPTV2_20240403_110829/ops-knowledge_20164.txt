User: From last one week I got stuck in this error. I have a dll from third party which needs to be linked for my system to behave properly. 
I have put the dll into the folder from where i am running the command prompt.  
For e.g. My python script is in C:/xyz and also my dll is in the same folder. When i am running the python script (using iron python) from cmd.exe it says that the dll is not found. 
I am able to run the same python script using iron python environment from visual studio and it is running fine. 
What could possibly go wrong?
Assistant: The error has been resolved. The problem was that the third party dll should be present in the folder where iron python executable is present. 
For e.g if ipy.exe is present in the folder C:\Program Files(x86)\Iron Python2.7 then the third party dll has to be present there.
The reason why it took me so long to figure this out because when i was using the previous version of the dll provided by the third party then it was not necessary to copy the dll in the path C:\Program Files(x86)\Iron Python2.7. But for the new version i have to do that. Strange it is!!
