**ATT&CK ID:** T1570  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Lateral Tool Transfer

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems within a compromised environment. After initially introducing these files into the victim's network (i.e., through Ingress Tool Transfer), they can be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files throughout the operation. This lateral movement often leverages inherent file-sharing protocols, such as SMB (Server Message Block) or Windows Admin Shares, to access connected network shares. Additionally, adversaries may use authenticated connections via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to facilitate the transfer of files between internal victim systems.
