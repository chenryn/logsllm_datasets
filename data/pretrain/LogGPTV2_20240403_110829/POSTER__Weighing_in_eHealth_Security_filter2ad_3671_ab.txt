Table 1: Security and privacy analysis results. Fail: major problems. Warn: some problems. Pass: with caveats
6. CONCLUSION
Our results show clear security and privacy problems in popu-
lar smart scale solutions. Vendors should be encouraged to meet
security standards as deﬁned for example by OWASP, CERT or
others even for devices that are targeted at consumers. Flawed
pairing processes and insecure software development lead to vul-
nerable solutions allowing attackers to easily eavesdrop on com-
munication. In future work, we plan to create summaries of our
ﬁndings that can be used by consumers and health care providers
to take informed decisions when buying products or using data
provided by products. We also plan to reach out to manufactur-
ers to discuss our ﬁndings.
