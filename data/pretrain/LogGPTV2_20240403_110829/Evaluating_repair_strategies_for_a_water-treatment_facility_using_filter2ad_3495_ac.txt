### System Cost and Survivability Analysis

#### System Costs
The system incurs an increased instantaneous cost during normal operation. In the model, each Resource Unit (RU) has a cost of one per hour when idle and zero when operational. Additionally, a failed RU incurs a cost of three per hour.

#### Cost Ranges and Components
There are three ranges for \( x \) of \( Ssl(x) \):
- \( X_1 = [0.33, 0.66) \)
- \( X_2 = [0.66, 1) \)
- \( X_3 = [1, 1] \)

The number of redundant components affects the survivability in different phases. For example, in Line 1, the numerical results show that the same survivability can be achieved with different amounts of redundant components, leading to different service intervals.

#### Recovery Speed and Service Intervals
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the recovery speed for \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) after the occurrence of Disaster 1. The extra repair crew in FRF-2 increases the recovery speed. Both figures demonstrate that the additional repair crew does not create extra service intervals.

#### Numerical Results
The numerical results are not included in this paper.

#### Instantaneous and Accumulated Costs
Figures 6 and 7 show the instantaneous and accumulated costs for Line 1 after Disaster 1. For service interval \( X_2 \), more components need to be repaired compared to \( X_1 \). This corresponds to the slower recovery of \( X_2 \) compared to \( X_1 \).

#### Trade-offs Between Recovery and Costs
To analyze the trade-off between recovery and induced costs, we consider:
- \( X_1 = [0.33, 0.5) \)
- \( X_2 = [0.5, 0.66) \)
- \( X_3 = [0.66, 1) \)
- \( X_4 = [1, 1] \)

Figures 8 and 9 show the recovery to service intervals \( X_1 \) and \( X_3 \) for Disaster 2. FFF-1 provides the slowest recovery for \( X_1 \) because the Reservoir is repaired later compared to FRF or DED. In \( X_3 \), the sand filter becomes more important due to its lower Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) and higher Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). Without the sand filter, \( X_3 \) cannot be reached.

#### Recovery and Cost Analysis
For \( X_3 \), FFF-1 and FFF-2 provide no service, while the Reservoir can still be repaired. Figures 10 and 11 show the instantaneous and accumulated costs for Disaster 2. FRF-1 has a slightly slower convergence to the slow recovery, but it also has the highest accumulated cost. DED, with a repair crew, has a faster recovery but a higher instantaneous cost.

#### Conclusions for Line 2
For Line 2, DED provides the best recovery but is expensive and impractical for many repair units. The combination of three redundant softeners and two redundant pumps results in four service intervals. A failing pump does not create extra service intervals.

#### Modeling and Analysis
We have modeled a simplified water treatment facility using a subclass of the Arcade framework mapped to PRISM reactive modules. PRISM allows us to derive various useful insights into the trade-offs between costs and reliability, particularly in terms of quantitative survivability. However, PRISM can only handle limited-size models. To address this, we plan to apply minimization techniques and reductions in the Arcade/CADP facilities.
