Europe. As explained in Sect. 3.4, RIPE IPmap is way more accurate
for the problem at hand and therefore we conclude that most track-
ing flows affecting European citizens terminate within GDPR’s legal
jurisdiction. The only sizeable percentage leaking outside Europe is
towards North America (10% of European tracking flows). Another
3% goes to neighboring non-EU28 European countries, such as,
Switzerland and Russia.

4.2 National jurisdiction
Figure 8 is a Sankey diagram for the origin-destination of tracking
flows originating in EU28 countries, where we have users in our
dataset (the thickness of a flow is proportional to the user base in
each country on the left column). We observe different levels of
national confinement. The UK leads with the highest confinement
of 58.4% within its borders. Spain follows with a confinement of
33.1%. Smaller counties like Greece, Romania, and Cyprus have
lower confinements, 6.77%, 5.1%, and 1,16% respectively. From this
data, there appears to be a positive correlation between the size
of a country and the amount of tracking flows confined within its
borders, but there are other important reasons that determine the
level of national confinement, as we explain in Sect. 5. In Sect. 7,
we use large ISP datasets to cover additional central and north
European countries for which we have rather few users in the
Sankey diagram to further investigate if the number of users can
influence the confinement level for such countries.
5 KEEPING TRACKING FLOWS LOCAL
In this section, we look at the effectiveness of different methods
for improving the localization of tracking flows. We consider two
methods to increase localization, namely, (i) DNS redirection, and
(ii) mirroring of tracking PoPs.
Apart from its value for privacy, localization can be beneficial
also for the ad domains, especially those serving targeted ads using
the RTB protocol. In RTB delivery delays need to be kept low to
improve the performance of real time bidding.
5.1 Localization potential using DNS
Our first investigation involves a simple DNS redirection based on
alternative servers that we have observed in our dataset for the same
tracking domain. We first quantify the improvement potential by
looking for alternative server locations operate under the same fully
qualified domain names (FQDN). Then, we find the corresponding
TLD for each FQDNs and consider the case of redirecting requests

as appropriate). Note that with DNS redirection, it is easy to change
the assignment of users to a server IP. For example, google time
to live (TTL) for DNS records is 300 seconds and facebook TTL is
7,200 seconds. Thus, DNS redirection can take place in relatively
small time scale, from seconds to a few hours.
5.2 Localization potential using Mirroring
For our second investigation, we turn our attention to PoP mirror-
ing using cloud services and the potential localization that such an
optimization can offer. For this hypothetical setup, we collect infor-
mation from nine major cloud service providers in which we know
from our dataset that tracking domains lease servers. These public
clouds make their global footprint and, in some cases, the associated
IP ranges publicly available in order to: (i) attract new customers by
advertising their presence at different regions, (ii) improve the oper-
ation of current customers by providing an accurate and up-to-date
map of IP ranges to physical location, and (iii) to white-list the IP
ranges, e.g., to update firewall rules. The major cloud providers we
consider in this study are: Amazon AWS [2], Microsoft Azure [17],
IBM Cloud [24], CloudFlare [23], Digital Ocean [6], Equinix [8],
Oracle Cloud [18], Rackspace [19], and Google Cloud [11]. For each
cloud service we collect the physical location of their operational
datacenters, at a country level, as advertised in each cloud service
website.
First, we check if the the confinement within the user’s region
can be further improved if tracking domains that are already host-
ing their server on these cloud services utilize additional PoPs
(PoP Mirroring), i.e., different datacenters of the same cloud service
provider. Under the “PoP Mirroring” scenario (Table 5 - Row 3),
it is evident that PoP mirroring yields good improvement of con-
finement within the GDPR legislation region, but not so great on
the national level. Furthermore, we observe that many countries
lack large public cloud PoPs, and the improvement in confinement
is expected to be marginal for these countries. Finally, at Table 5 -
Row 5, we present the confinement percentage and improvement,
respectively, by combining DNS redirection at TLD level with PoP
Mirroring. The combination yield an additional improvement of
40.52% and 11.2% at the country and continent level, respectively.
Next, we investigate the extreme scenario where all tracking
domains can potentially migrate to any cloud PoP from all PoPs
that we observe in all nine major cloud services. After examining
our results in Table 6 (Right column), we see that countries such
as, Denmark (69.85%), Greece (79.25%) and Romania (72.12%) can
achieve 96.85%, 79.25% and 72.12% additional confinement over

pean Union (EU28) countries using the RIPE IPmap geoloca-
tion service.
for the FQDN to any alternative servers that belong to the same
TLD level that can further improve the confinement.
Table 5 depicts the results of the different approaches. The first
row (Default) depicts the base line of the confinement percentage
at country and continent level for all the tracking flows that we
observe in our dataset. In the case of DNS redirections based on
FQDN level, we observe an additional confinement up to 5.5% and
24.55% at continent and country level, respectively (Table 5 - Row
2, Right column). DNS Redirection has a non-negligible positive
contribution to keeping tracking local within GDPR jurisdiction. If
applied at TLD, the improvement in our dataset is more than 10%.
However, it plays an even higher role in improving confinement
within national boarders. In this case, the improvement under TLD
redirection is an impressive 38%.
Based on our “what-if" analysis, we conclude that, with a more
thoughtful (or GDPR friendly) DNS redirection on behalf of the
tracking domain administrators, the overall confinement can be im-
proved at both country and continent level, with minimal additional
financial cost (that includes additional server and network capacity

the “Default” outgoing tracking flows, respectively. In contrast,
using only PoP Mirroring (Table 6 - Right column) the confinement
improvement is negligible, below 1.3%, for the above three countries.
On the other hand, countries such us Cyprus cannot benefit from
this scenario since none of the nine cloud services in our study has
a presence in the country. Note that if a tracking operator is willing
to utilize any datacenter available in a country, then it is possible
to achieve complete flow confinement at the national level. In all
EU28 countries there is at least one datacenter, even in the smallest
country.
In summary, we observe that there exists a correlation between
the density level of IT infrastructure of a country, mostly in terms
of datacenters, and the confinement of tracking flows within its
borders. The confinement of tracking flows within national borders
can be improved in many cases, either by using DNS or mirroring
of tracking PoPs, at a relatively low cost. However, in some small
countries with less developed IT infrastructure, the improvement
of the confinement of tracking flows within national borders may
require proportionally high cost or expansion of the footprint of
major cloud providers in these countries.
6 TRACING SENSITIVE TRACKING FLOWS
GDPR [5] defines sensitive personal data as any data “revealing
racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
beliefs, or trade union membership”, also “genetic data, biometric
data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data
concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or
sexual orientation”. In this section, we try to find if tracking flows
exist on sensitive data, and if they do, look at their geographic
confinement.
6.1 Methodology
In total, we observe more than 76K first party domains in our dataset.
To identify domains that fall into the sensitive categories we use
a multi-stage filtering process involving automated and manual
inspection of website content.
As a first step we use AdWords [10], an online tagging service
provided by Google, to detect the interest topics of the visited
domain. Usually we have 5 to 15 interest topics per domain. Next,
we use automated look up to detect whether any of the AdWords
Figure 9: The percentage of websites for each sensitive topic
that ad + tracking third-party domains where present in our
dataset. We observe 127K requests towards sensitive topics,
2.89% of the total tracking flows we observed
categories of a specific domain contains any of the 7 sensitive
categories defined by GDPR. If a domain topic matched we include
it in our analysis. We also manually examine the remaining domains
to see if they contained any semantic categories that had a semantic
relevance/overlap with GDPR defined sensitive terms. We used
multiple people for this and include a domain in our analysis when
at least 2 independent examiners agreed that it was relevant to a
GDPR sensitive term.
Overall, we inspected 5,698 domains over a period that spans
two weeks. We chose to manually inspect the content since most
tagging systems do not include sensitive categories. For example
a website related to pregnancy falls into the category “Health”.
Similarly, websites related to pornography, alcohol and gambling
will fall into the categories “Men’s Interests”, “Food & Drinks” and
“Games”, respectively. Thus, by manually inspecting the website
content we can identify websites belonging to sensitive categories
with high accuracy. In total we identify 12 sensitive categories (see
Fig. 9) from 1,067 domains. The total number of tracking flows
related to sensitive categories is 127K.
6.2 Results
Figure 9 depicts the percentage of tracking flows for each sensitive
category. The most heavily tracked category is “Health” with 38%
of the tracking flows followed by gambling with 22%. Sex related
categories, such as, sexual orientation and pregnancy have identical
percentage ≈ 11%, followed by politics and porn at 9% and 7%,
respectively. Religion, ethnicity, guns, alcohol, cancer and death
are below 3%. Note that in the case of the categories cancer and
death, both belong to the category “Health”, but we report them
separately due to their obvious sensitivity.
In Fig. 10, we present the destination continent of the tracking
flows for each sensitive category. We observe similar trends as with
the aggregated results, i.e., most tracking flows are confined within
GDPR (EU28 84.9%) but a non-trivial percentage (12.7%) is collected

in North America. The categories with the highest leakage out of
EU28 are: porn (44%), sexual orientation (36%) and alcohol (33%).
Finally, in Fig. 11, we plot the confinement for each EU28 country,
where we observe tracking flows on sensitive category domains.
The black numbers (right) depict the total number of sensitive flows
for the corresponding country, and the white numbers (left) show
the flows that travel outside the country. The trends are similar
to the aggregated results thus, countries with a small population
and limited IT infrastructure, e.g., Cyprus, Greece, Denmark and
Romania seem to experiencing more leakage on sensitive tracking
flows.
7 SCALING UP: A VIEW FROM ISPS
Next, we examine the geographical distribution of tracking flows
involving subscribers of various large European ISPs. In particular,
we analyze data from four ISPs in three European countries. The
analysis of ISP data contributes to our study in multiple ways:
(i) the ISP datasets capture the traffic of millions of real users,
thereby allowing us to scale up our study and validate our previous
observations and conclusions drawn from our browser extension
users, (ii) they increase the diversity of our study, not only because
the studied ISPs operate in different countries, but also because
their users are residential, mobile, or both, and (iii) they operate
in countries where we did not have a large user base in our active
experiment, thus, complementing our study.
7.1 Profile of ISPs
Table 7 provides a brief summary of the profile of the four ISPs.

customer base and traffic volume in Germany and Europe with
more than 15 million broadband residential lines. Since it is difficult

has also a smaller fraction in the broadband market. Overall, this
ISP serves more than 6 million users in Hungary, primarily mobile
users.
7.2 Methodology
To identify the tracking flows from ISP NetFlows, we rely on the list
of IPs of tracking services compiled using the browser extension as
described in Sect. 3. In addition, we also collected data for the period
mid-Jan. to July 2018 using the same methodology. We perform the
ISP study using daily snapshot activity, on four days: (i) Wednesday,
Nov. 11, 2017, (ii) Wednesday, April 4, 2018, (iii) Wednesday, May
16, 2018 (close to the implementation date of the EU GDPR law on
May 25, 2018), and (iv) Wednesday, June 20, 2018 (after the imple-
mentation date of the EU GDPR law). Note that the data collection
in the time period between mid- Jan. to end of July is related only
to the results presented in table 7 under the columns June 20 and is
only related to the ISP’s analysis after the implementation date of
