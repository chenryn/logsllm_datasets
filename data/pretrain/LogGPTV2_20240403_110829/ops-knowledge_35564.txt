User: I need an IDE that can do the following:

Run on an oldish laptop (2GB Ram, 1.9 ghz intel celeron M)
Run well on an oldish laptop (with a browswer open)
Be able to run on windows
Be able to run smoothly on windows
Is able to do Java (or, if you really can't find anything, C# will be okay)
An extension or something for Python would be nice
Django support would be awesome
It would be great to have SFTP/FTP editing support that actually works

I don't care about lots of extensibility or commercial support or a kitchen sink or any of that, I just need it to be stable and all of the above.
And, Vim or EMACS aren't answers since they (in my mind, without excessive configuration) don't qualify as IDEs.
And, if this doesn't belong here, please tell me.
EDIT: Code completion is also important.
Assistant: notepad++ has an ftp plugin that works very nicely and runs on very little resource. Will syntax highlight most languages and has some compiler support.
