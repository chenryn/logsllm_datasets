Hello !  
I want to make a automatic screenshot program but I have a annoying EU cookie
popup on my screenshot. How i can remove these in Playwright ?
I try this solution but it don't work T_T
    const browser = await playwright.firefox.launch({
       headless: true,
       firefoxUserPrefs: {
        "network.cookie.cookieBehavior": 2
       }
    });
Thank !
