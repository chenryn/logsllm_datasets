While following the tutorial, I encountered an issue when attempting to run the command `$ flask initdb`. The error message I received is as follows:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/dvf/environments/flaskTutorial/bin/flask", line 11, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())
  ...
  File "/Users/dvf/environments/flaskTutorial/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask_cli/cli.py", line 90, in locate_app
    __import__(module)
ImportError: No module named flaskr
```

To resolve this issue, I modified the environment variable `FLASK_APP` to point to the correct file, using the following command:

```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr.py
```

This solution was tested on macOS 10.11.3 with Python 2.7.12.
