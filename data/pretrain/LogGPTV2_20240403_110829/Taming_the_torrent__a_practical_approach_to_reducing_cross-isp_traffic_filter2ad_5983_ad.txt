recommended peers, by comparison with that of randomly selected
nodes. In particular, we see the average download rate for Ono-
recommended peers improves by 207% and their median download
rate is higher by 883%.
To compare against an ISP with uniform (and relatively low)
bandwidth constraints, Fig. 8 shows a CDF of download perfor-
mance for Easynet,3 an ISP located in the UK. This ISP offers 4
or 8 Mb/s downstream with only 768 Kb/s upstream. As the ﬁgure
clearly shows, any performance gains that could be attained by Ono
in terms of transfer rates are negated by the suboptimal bandwidth
allocation. Further, we believe that the higher median performance
seen by default BitTorrent peer selection comes from the ability
to ﬁnd peers in other networks that are less constrained by upload
bandwidth allocation and therefore provide higher throughput.
Finally, we demonstrate that the bandwidth allocation model in
the RDSNET ISP, when coupled with Ono, provides a mutually
beneﬁcial environment in which BitTorrent users see higher trans-
fer performance while reducing the cost for ISPs in terms of cross-
ISP trafﬁc. The bar graph in Fig. 9 illustrates this by contrasting the
AS hop count for the two example ISPs. The x-axis in this graph
represents the number of AS hops along paths between peers and
3http://www.easynetconnect.co.uk
the y-axis represents the average of the download rates between
these peers. It is clear that RDSNET, which offers higher transfer
rates inside the ISP, allows users to obtain signiﬁcant performance
gains by reducing cross-ISP trafﬁc. On the other hand, Easynet,
which does not offer different transfer rates for in-network trafﬁc,
exhibits negligible performance differences for connections with
different AS-path lengths. Consequently, performance from Ono-
recommended peers will not be signiﬁcantly different than those
picked at random.
These results make the case for a new ISP-based approach to
the problem of taming BitTorrent that is compatible with biased
peer selection as implemented in this work. Rather than blocking
BitTorrent ﬂows, ISPs should change their bandwidth allocations
so that it is more favorable to connect to peers inside the ISP
than to those outside. Assuming that the former trafﬁc costs are
much smaller than cross-ISP trafﬁc costs, this approach should lead
to substantial savings for ISPs, higher subscriber satisfaction and
fewer legal issues.

ISP trafﬁc without sacriﬁcing download performance when using

trafﬁc and Easynet does not. In the former case, Ono leads
to signiﬁcant performance gains.

a single CDN name. Ono supports the reuse of information from
multiple CDNs and through various CDN names; we now examine
its performance when using other CDN names. To generate each
of the following ﬁgures, we use the same methodology as in the
previous sections. In addition to plotting a curve for peers found
using each CDN name, we include a curve for peers found through
BitTorrent’s random selection algorithm for comparison. Each
curve is labeled with the abbreviation for its corresponding CDN
name in Table 2.
Figure 10 shows a CDF of the average number of AS hops to
peers found by Ono for each CDN name. It is immediately clear
that there are essentially two levels of service provided by CDN
names used by Ono. The best CDN names, which include all of the
Akamai CDN names except Air Asia, lead to large reductions in
cross-ISP trafﬁc with nearly half of the Ono-recommended peers
being located at most one AS hop away from the source. The
other CDN names, which include Air Asia (Akamai) and ABC’s
streaming video site (Limelight), lead to median AS-hop values
triple those of the previous curves. Using these names, however,
Ono can still signiﬁcantly reduce cross-ISP trafﬁc—it is over three
times more likely than random to ﬁnd a peer that is at most one AS
hop away.
The reason for the different performance curves is that different
CDNs and CDN names correspond to different approaches for
providing service to their customers. For example, consider the
two levels of service provided by the Akamai CDN. For the
better curves, Akamai directs Web clients to one of over 10,000
replica servers worldwide. Because these servers are often located
in ISP points-of-presence, the information gathered from these
redirections can often be used to distinguish between peers in
different ISPs. The Air Asia CDN name offers lower performance
to Ono because Air Asia subscribes to a different CDN service that
uses a small subset of Akamai data centers located at a number
of key locations worldwide. Finally, the worst Ono performance
comes from using the Limelight CDN. Limelight uses a small
number (< 20) of data centers distributed worldwide (similar to
the service provided by the Air Asia CDN name), thus providing
much coarser proximity information. Even in this case, Ono can
still signiﬁcantly reduce cross-ISP trafﬁc when compared to default
BitTorrent peer selections.
The RTT latency to Ono-recommended peers is presented in
Fig. 11 on a semilog scale. Similar to the previous ﬁgure, we see

a clear separation among the curves indicating different levels of
service. The best curves see two orders of magnitude improvement
in median latency as described in Section 6.3. The next best curve
shows larger average latencies, yet the median latency to Ono-
recommended peers is still approximately an order of magnitude
smaller than to peers selected at random by BitTorrent. Finally, the
Limelight CDN, which offers the lowest performance of the group,
still allows Ono to reduce mean latency by more than half compared
to BitTorrent selection.
When considering the packet loss rates to Ono-recommended
peers (Fig. 12), we ﬁnd that all of the CDN names result in paths
with lower loss rates on average than paths to peers picked by
unbiased BitTorrent. The loss rates for the AA and AB CDN names
are slightly higher than the rest, most likely because those CDN
names on average produce longer paths to peers (both in terms of
AS hops and router hops).
The curves for different CDN names in Fig. 13(a) and 13(b),
which describe download and upload performance, are nearly
identical. This lends further evidence to the claim that most
BitTorrent connections are severely restricted by limited available
bandwidth, which reduces the likelihood of seeing performance

gains provided by high-quality paths found by Ono. We note,
however, that there is noticeable separation in the curves as they
approach higher throughput. We believe this occurs because at
higher transfer rates, the TCP ﬂows are much more sensitive to
the latency and packet loss beneﬁts from Ono peer selection.
Regardless, the average transfer performance for all Ono curves is
higher than that of unbiased BitTorrent, with improvements ranging
from 6.4% to 33% in the downstream transfer rates.
7. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we demonstrated how to use CDNs as a low-cost
approximation to an ideal oracle for a biased peer selection service.
An alternative low-cost approach is to select only peers whose
AS numbers (ASNs) are identical. Though it will indeed reduce
cross-ISP trafﬁc, this approach suffers from several limitations. On
the one hand, AS-level information can be too ﬁne-grained. For
example, large ISPs have been assigned many ASNs (e.g., Comcast
has over 40 different ASNs), so using these numbers can restrict
