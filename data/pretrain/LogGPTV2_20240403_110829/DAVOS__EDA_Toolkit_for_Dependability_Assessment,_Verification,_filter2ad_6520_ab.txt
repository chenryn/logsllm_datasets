### Benefits and Limitations of Existing Approaches

Existing approaches to accelerate the notoriously slow simulation of implementation-level models do not fully meet the necessary requirements. 

### Introduction to DAVOS

This paper introduces DAVOS (Dependability Assessment, Verification, Optimization, and Selection), an EDA toolkit that seamlessly integrates dependability-driven processes into the semi-custom design flow. DAVOS addresses most of the aforementioned challenges by enabling:

1. **Robustness Assessment**: Identification of dependability bottlenecks in hardware designs.
2. **Verification**: Evaluation of deployed dependability-related strategies.
3. **Benchmarking**: Selection of alternative IP cores, EDA tools, and implementation technologies from a Performance, Power, Area, and Dependability (PPAD) perspective.
4. **Design Space Exploration (DSE)**: Tuning the configuration parameters of IP cores and EDA tools to optimize PPAD goals.

DAVOS remains interoperable with existing standard HDLs and off-the-shelf EDA tools, including synthesizers, placers, routers, and simulators.

## DAVOS Toolkit

### Core Architecture

DAVOS is built around a set of custom modules that can be launched from the command line on any operating system with a basic Python distribution installed. These modules are configured using dedicated XML files that hierarchically describe the required data and/or configuration parameters. Interactive monitoring and data visualization capabilities are provided via a web interface.

#### Internal Architecture

The internal architecture of DAVOS, as shown in Figure 1, is designed to ensure that custom-developed modules are interoperable with standard off-the-shelf EDA tools. Each module provides the following core functionalities:

1. **Design of Experiments**: This module enables the definition of all required designs when different alternatives are considered. Full factorial designs are generated for a reduced number of alternatives (including just one). Otherwise, fractional factorial designs are proposed.
2. **Implementation and PPA Estimation**: This module runs the semi-custom design flow for each design and the selected implementation technology, computing Performance, Power, and Area (PPA) attributes for each implementation. Different EDA tools can be assigned to each implementation phase.
3. **Fault Injection and Dependability Estimation**: This module estimates the dependability-related attributes of each design using an integrated simulation-based fault injection tool. Any commercial simulator can be used for this task.
4. **Regression Analysis**: This module complements fractional factorial designs by computing regression models to estimate PPAD attributes for all alternatives in the design space. Statistical artifacts ensure valid estimations from a small sample.
5. **Decision Support**: This module supports the hierarchical analysis of multiple goals under different application scenarios using Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques.
6. **Data and Report Management**: This module collects data from other modules and provides a web interface for process monitoring, data querying, and visualization.

### Control Flow

Coordinating the action of these custom modules and off-the-shelf EDA tools requires adapting the control flow of DAVOS according to specific scenarios and tools. This flexibility is achieved through XML configuration files that must be customized for the desired control flow. For example, the excerpt in Figure 2 generates the required scripts to run the implementation module with the Xilinx ISE toolchain.

Each EDA tool or suite comprises several phases, each with different configuration parameters. The `implementation` section of the configuration file includes a subsection for each stage of the semi-custom design flow. Each phase has the following attributes:

- **Name**: Identifier for the phase.
- **Next**: Specifies the next phase to be executed after successful completion.
- **Postcondition**: An assertion that must be true after the phase, such as checking for the existence of specific files.
- **Result Handler**: A Python function that processes information and generates reports.
- **Script Builder**: A Python function that generates the command line script for the associated module and/or tool.

Additionally, the configuration file can include `Default` and `Constraint` subsections to define default values and iteratively tune implementation constraints, respectively.

### Example Application Scenarios
