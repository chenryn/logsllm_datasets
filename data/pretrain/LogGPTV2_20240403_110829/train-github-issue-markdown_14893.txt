I'm trying to use both fitCenter and placeholder but the image does not get
resized.
This code works fine (image is scaled down, aspect ratio is correct):
    Glide.with(this).load(url).fitCenter().into(mImage);
This code does not work (placeholder is correct, but loaded image appears
squished, aspect ratio is wrong):
    Glide.with(this).load(url).placeholder(R.drawable.placeholder).fitCenter().into(mImage);
