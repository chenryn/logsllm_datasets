Fig. 3. Conﬁguration of the FLISR emulator
As introduced in previous section, Bro IDS [17] is utilized
to implement HC-NIDS which is the core component of our
implementation. We used Bro’s Turing-complete language to
implement our intrusion detection rules in terms of policy
scripts. The last part of our experimental implementation is
a set of scenarios that demonstrate the capability of the HC-
NIDS for detecting several types of attacks. For this purpose,
we programmed a Modbus Master Simulator in C that acts
as the attacker in the FLISR system. We assume that the
attacker initiates a connection with the slave controller during
the periods when there is not any packet exchange between
the two controllers.
A. Intrusion Detection Using Communication Information
1) DoS Attempt: The main purpose of the DoS attack
is to make the slave controller unavailable to its intended
master controller. Under the assumption mentioned above, the
attacker dispatches queries to the slave controller. The HC-
NIDS analyzes the network trafﬁc and checks the expected
trafﬁc rules, as described in previous section. In this case, the
HC-NIDS determines if a non-acceptable IP address commits
queries, and produces an alarm that notiﬁes the network
administrator about the suspicious attempt.
2) Data Memory Access: The objective of this attack sce-
nario is to probe the status of physical devices to gather data to
take further action, such as causing power outages. We assume
the attacker obtains information about the FLISR master’s IP
778
address and dispatches a “read” command request. The HC-
NIDS determines that a “read” command function code is not
in the list of acceptable function codes and generates an alarm
indicating an attempted illicit action.
B. Intrusion Detection Using Physical Information
1) De-energizing the Distribution Feeder: In this attack, the
attacker aims to de-energize the whole distribution feeder by
opening the main feeder CB. We assume the attacker retrieves
information of the FLISR network conﬁguration, including the
controllers’ IP addresses, the memory allocation, and mapping
to the physical devices, and the utilized command function
codes. However, we assume that the attacker is not aware of
the communication procedure of FLISR physical operation.
Based on the information obtained from the network trafﬁc,
the attacker sends a “write” command request to open the CB.
In this case, the malevolent attempt passes the three intru-
sion detection rules, i.e., controllers’ IP addresses, command
function codes and operation cycle’s duration. However, the
HC-NIDS detects that the initial packet is not followed by an
opening command to the SSs, so it is not consistent with
the normal operation procedure of FLISR in Fig. 2. More
speciﬁcally, this attack scenario only includes the exchange
of one “write” command query that targets the CB, and thus
a faulty physical operation is observed and the HC-NIDS
generates an alert.
2) Causing Power Outage for Intended Load Points: In this
attack, the attacker aims to cause a power outage for certain
load points by isolating speciﬁc line sections. We assume
that the attacker is aware of the controllers’ IP addresses, the
utilized command function codes, and the physical operation
procedure of FLISR in Fig. 2. However, we assume that the
attacker is not aware of the FLISR operation cycle’s duration.
The attacker generates an acceptable packet sequence with
the master controller’s IP address and the utilized command
function codes. First, the attacker dispatches a “write” com-
mand request to activate the CB, and then sends a second
“write” command request in order to activate speciﬁc SSs.
The HC-NIDS observes the time gap between the newly issued
queries and detects that the packets’ time gap is not consistent
with the expected time gap between two packet requests. This
observation triggers the HC-NIDS to issue an alert that indi-
cates the occurrence of a possible malevolent action. Figure
4 shows the timing difference between normal network trafﬁc
and several simulated attacks. The attack packets constitute
larger time gaps which obviously makes them identiﬁable in
comparison to the normal trafﬁc.
C. A Sophisticated Insider Attack Scenario
This attack is similar to the attack that causes power outages
for intended load points. However, we now assume that the
attacker has a complete knowledge about the FLISR process
and the network that includes the controllers’ IP addresses, the
command function codes, the physical operation procedure,
and the operation cycle’s duration. Thus,
the attacker is
able to dispatch queries that are completely consistent with

Fig. 4. Timing difference between normal network trafﬁc and attacks
the system’s expected behavior as reﬂected in network and
application layers of the communication packets. We assume
that just before the master controller initiates a new block
of packets, the attacker takes charge of the connection and
initiates a block of packets that follow the observed features
of the FLISR network trafﬁc.
Detecting this attack scenario requires additional data to
validate adherence to the circuit conservation laws, as stated
in the ﬁfth rule in subsection III.B. However, since we are
only monitoring one communication path, as we have currently
implemented it, the HC-NIDS does not receive the sufﬁcient
information about the currents, voltages, and ﬂows of power
to check for consistency with the conservation laws.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK
Securing ADSs is of undoubtedly great importance, due
to the fact that security could have severe impacts on the
performance and economics of these systems. In order to
assess the effects of potential threats, and protect ADSs in
a more efﬁcient way, we believe that it is necessary to utilize
important information related to the physical part of the system
for intrusion detection. Our paper identiﬁes the importance of
including both the information from physical system operation,
embedded in the application layer, and network trafﬁc data in
the intrusion detection rules. While this work focuses on smart
grid ADS applications, the proposed approach could be applied
in order augment the security of other smart grid applications,
as well as various cyber-physical systems. A goal of our future
work is to augment our HC-NIDS with detailed physical data
in about voltages, currents, and ﬂows of power, which would
allow us to implement intrusion detection rules based on the
