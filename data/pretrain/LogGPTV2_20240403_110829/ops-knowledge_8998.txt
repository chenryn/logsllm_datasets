Question: "An adversary has employed protocol tunneling to hide malicious traffic within encrypted HTTPS packets, evading network filtering and reaching systems that would otherwise be inaccessible. As a security analyst, you are tasked with proposing mitigation strategies to counter this threat. Which of the following strategies would be effective in mitigating the risks associated with protocol tunneling used for command and control activities, and why might they be beneficial?"
 "A": "Implement strict egress filtering to prevent unauthorized outbound connections, potentially disrupting the adversary's established communication channels."
 "B": "Increase the complexity of network passwords to prevent adversaries from gaining initial access, thereby avoiding the need for protocol tunneling."
 "C": "Employ network intrusion prevention systems to identify and prevent traffic associated with specific adversary malware based on network signatures."
 "D": "Encourage users to adopt strong endpoint security practices, such as regular patching, which can indirectly mitigate the risk of protocol tunneling."
Answer: AC
