that uses
the properties of the physical medium (communication range
constraint) and computationally efﬁcient cryptographic prim-
itives to allows sensors to determine their location, even in
the presence of security threats. Sensors rely on localization
information transmitted from reference points with known
location and orientation, in order to estimate their position.
SeRLoc provides secure localization under the assumption that
any attacker cannot selectively jam transmissions of reference
points. Reference points are equipped with directional anten-
nas in order to provide higher localization accuracy at the
sensors. However, further increase of the localization accuracy
requires the deployment of more reference points or the use
of more directional antennas at each reference point.
In [6] ˘Capkun and Hubaux propose SPINE, a secure range-
based positioning based on bounding the distance of each
sensor to at least three reference points. By using timers with
nanosecond precision, each sensor can bound its distance to
any reference point within range. If the sensor is within a
triangle formed by three reference points,
it can compute
its position via a method called veriﬁable multilateration.
Veriﬁable multilateration provides a robust position estimate,
assuming that any attacker does not collude with compromised
nodes. However, in order to perform veriﬁable multilateration
a high number of reference point is required [6].
In [20] Lazos et al. propose ROPE, a range-independent
localization scheme that limits the impact of a multiple attacks
such as the wormhole attack [12], the Sybil attack [9], [13],
[33] and selective jamming, without the need for deploying
a large number of reference points. Rope relies on computa-
tionally efﬁcient cryptographic primitives to secure the beacon
transmissions from the reference points , as well as distance
bounding [4], [6] to verify the distance of each sensor to
at least one reference point. Hence, any adversary can only
displace a sensor within a limited region.
In [22], Liu et al. propose a robust range-dependent local-

(MMSE) to ﬁlter outliers, and compute the position of the
sensors using a consistent set of range estimates. The method
presented in [22] prevents attackers from displacing sensors
by corrupting a small set of range estimates. However, the
valid set of range estimates cannot be identiﬁed if the attacker
successfully corrupts a large set of range estimates (more than
the benign ones).
In [21], Li et al. propose the use of robust statistical methods
for ﬁltering out the outliers in the sample set used to estimate
the sensors’ location. The authors illustrate how they can
limit the impact of the outliers by employing a Least Median
Squares (LMS) technique. As in the case of the method in [22],
the authors make the implicit assumption that the majority of
the observations collected by each sensor are benign and only
a few samples are corrupted. However, in speciﬁc types of
attacks such as the wormhole [12] and Sybil attack [9], the
majority of the samples can be malicious.
VII. DISCUSSION AND OPEN PROBLEMS
The localization schemes that have been proposed for
robust estimation of the position of sensors in the presence
of adversaries can be classiﬁed into two main classes. The
schemes proposed in [21], [22], do not consider a speciﬁc
adversarial model. Instead, they consider that some fraction of
the localization information is corrupted, while the majority of
the observations are benign. The information can be corrupted
either due to network faults or due to some type of attack.
Using statistical methods, schemes of the ﬁrst class ﬁlter out
outliers and estimate the position of sensors by considering
only a consistent subset of the set of the collected observations.
The schemes proposed in [6], [18]–[20], consider speciﬁc
adversarial models and examine the potential attacks an ad-
versary can launch in order to disrupt the localization process.
Using the characteristics of the adversarial models, schemes
of this class propose mechanisms to secure the localization
against the different types of feasible attacks.
HiRLoc belongs to the second class of algorithms where
a speciﬁc adversarial model is considered. We have shown
that an adversary cannot disrupt HiRLoc by corrupting range
estimates, since no such estimates are used to compute the
position of sensors. An attacker can potentially enlarge the
communication range of the locators in an effort to displace
the sensors. However such an enlargement is equivalent to the
wormhole attack that is detected and prevented with a very
high probability when using HiRLoc as presented in Section
IV-B. An attacker can also attempt to reduce the communica-
tion range of the locators. A reduction in communication range
does not lead to sensor displacement since any sensor hearing
a locator will still be within the nominal communication range
even if it has been reduced by some attack.
In addition, an adversary attempting to disrupt HiRLoc gains
no beneﬁt from compromising sensor nodes since sensors
do not assist in the localization of other sensors. The only
usable information extracted from compromising a sensor is
the globally shared key K0. Though a single sensor compro-
mise reveals the K0, broadcasting with a commonly shared
13
key is the most bandwidth and energy-efﬁcient solution. The
adversary can only use K0 to launch a Sybil attack. However,
the Sybil attack can be prevented with a high probability as
presented in Section IV-C. In the case where a higher level
of security is required compared to the one offered by the
globally shared key, one can adopt the broadcast authentication
techniques as in [23], [29]. However, both those techniques
require time synchronization among all nodes of the network
not currently required for HiRLoc.
In HiRLoc, an attacker can successfully displace sensors
by compromising a threshold number of locators (reference
point). However, as with any localization algorithm, if the
coordinate system used to localize the sensor is false, then the
location estimation is false. In addition, an adversary is able
to displace sensors if it can selectively jam transmissions of
locators. HiRLoc is not jamming resistant. However, such a
feature can be added in HiRLoc by employing the distance
bounding technique presented in [4], [6], [20]. Jamming
resistance comes at
the expense of hardware complexity,
since sensors need to be equipped with clocks of nanosecond
precision in order to perform distance bounding.
On the other hand the methods using robust statistical
methods [21], [22] do not attempt to prevent any speciﬁc type
of attack. They provide a robust estimate of the position of the
sensors as long as the majority of the observations are benign.
Though most observations collected in the whole network
may be benign, an adversary can launch attacks to pockets
of the network and corrupt the majority of the observations
in a conﬁned network region. As an example consider the
wormhole attack described in Section IV-B. In such an attack,
the beacons replayed by the attacker provide false localization
information to a speciﬁc set of sensors. For the sensors under
attack the localization process is compromised if the replayed
beacons are more than the benign ones. Statistical methods
that rely on the detection of consistent subsets of information,
will fail to discern the replayed beacons from the valid ones
and accept the replayed set of beacons as the most consistent
one.
Both classes of solutions to the robust sensor localization
problem are by no means perfectly secure to adversaries. In
fact, due to the resource constraint nature of the sensor devices,
there is a tradeoff between the robustness in the location
estimation and the hardware and computational complexity.
From the related work, it is evident that no single approach
can prevent all types of attacks. A multi-modal approach that
takes into account multiple features of the sensor network is
required in order to build a robust localization system. Finally,
a formal classiﬁcation of the threat models and their direct
relation with the localization error is needed.
VIII. CONCLUSION
We studied the problem of sensor localization in the pres-
ence of malicious adversaries and proposed a high-resolution
range-independent
localization scheme called HiRLoc. We
showed that HiRLoc localizes sensors with signiﬁcantly higher
accuracy than previously proposed methods, while requir-
ing fewer hardware resources. Furthermore, we showed that
HiRLoc allows the robust location computation even in the
presence of security threats in WSN, such as the wormhole at-
tack, the Sybil attack and compromise of network entities. Our
simulation studies conﬁrmed that variation of the transmission
parameters at the reference points leads to high-resolution
location estimation.
