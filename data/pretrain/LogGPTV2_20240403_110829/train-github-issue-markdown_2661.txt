I'm using Session.request to do GET from a HTTPS URL where the the server side
certificate may be invalid. For testing purposes, if the certificate is
invalid, I want to retry the GET with 'verify=False'. I'm reusing the Session
for the retry, but the second request also fails even though I specify
'verify=False' in the request. It seems that the verify state is persisted in
the Session somewhere and not updated from the request parameters if already
set in a previous request. Is this the expected behavior? It seems unusual to
me. If I create a new Session for the second request the certificate doesn't
get checked in this request.
