User: I've researched this on different places, including stackoverflow, and I can't find an answer that helps me.
I'm using Windows 7, 64 bit, with Atom for 64 bit Windows. I have Python 3.6.1 installed in the directory C:\Users\Austin\Documents\Python. When I try to run a simple script to test Python in Atom, it says

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.

I tried to run the same script in the command line, and it said the same thing. I'm new to programming, so please try to be a little patient.
Assistant: Reinstall the latest Python version. One of the first installation screens has a toggle box at the bottom that you can click to add the directory to Path. This worked for me when I ran into the same problem. You have to manually click though and it's easy to ignore it.
