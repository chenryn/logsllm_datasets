User: I'm testing some python code that parses command line input. Is there a way to pass this input in through IDLE? Currently I'm saving in the IDLE editor and running from a command prompt.
I'm running Windows.
Assistant: import sys
sys.argv = [sys.argv[0], '-arg1', 'val1', '-arg2', 'val2']
//If you're passing command line for 'help' or 'verbose' you can say as:
sys.argv = [sys.argv[0], '-h']
