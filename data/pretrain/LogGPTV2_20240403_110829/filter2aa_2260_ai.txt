### Denver Urban Area (UA) Tactical Interoperable Communications Analysis

#### Governance: Established Implementation
The Denver UA, established in July 2003, has formed a communications subcommittee to make key decisions and recommendations on interoperability. The committee is highly active, holding bi-monthly meetings, and most agencies within the UA have participated in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) process. However, the subcommittee lacks a formal charter that defines its missions, responsibilities, and authorities. Additionally, no steps have been taken to ensure that the work of the governing body is being adopted by individual agencies, and agreements are not in place for all agencies noted in the TICP.

Despite regular activity, it is unclear whether the current approach to prioritize and sustain funding is sufficient to support long-term interoperability goals, such as extending solutions to other jurisdictions. While the Denver UA has completed the TICP, a strategic plan accepted by all stakeholders is not yet in place. Developing a strategic plan would help coordinate the area’s communications interoperability efforts with the State’s initiatives.

**Recommendations:**
- Create a formal regional governance board to manage multidisciplinary and agency communications and coordinate with state interoperability efforts.
- Continue to recruit and sign on additional participants, including emergency medical services, public support agencies, schools, and nearby Department of Defense facilities.
- Develop and publish a regional strategic plan, including vision, objectives, funding, and procurement strategy, and obtain acceptance from all participants.
- Ensure coordination of the strategic plan with the state’s plan.
- Enhance the regional interoperability funding strategy to include long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources.
- Ensure buy-in for standardizing the distribution of information to participating agencies.
- Increase leadership participation in state and local jurisdictions outside of Denver, specifically the leadership of the Consolidated Communications Network of Colorado (CCNC).

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Established Implementation
The Denver UA has effectively used the TICP process to expand on existing interoperability procedures. SOPs are regional in scope and are actively disseminated to agencies participating in communications planning, providing a solid basis for implementation. The Denver TICP was a collaborative effort with all agencies in the area and became a model for other areas. Five training videos were developed to institutionalize regional procedures, indicating a strong commitment to SOP adoption.

However, the TICP validation exercise revealed significant issues with NIMS/ICS command and control policies, such as proper ICS terminology and confusion about incident command. More training is recommended.

**Recommendations:**
- Distribute regional SOPs beyond the core city and county of Denver through training, exercises, and day-to-day usage.
- Ensure that interoperability materials (SOPs, training information) are distributed from regional communications meetings to all jurisdictions’ first responders.
- Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs, including communications unit implementation consistent with the TICP, to ensure NIMS/ICS compliance.

#### Usage: Established Implementation
The Denver UA regularly uses its two major shared systems, and the fixed gateway system is actively promoted and used weekly. Although some issues were encountered during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., radios not updated with appropriate channels, radio cache requests not fulfilled), the After Action Report indicated broad and largely effective use of interagency communications capabilities.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue training and exercises on interagency communications to improve seamless interoperability.
- Continue training on the fixed gateway system to improve familiarity.
- Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises.

### Technology Overview
The City of Denver and several agencies along the Interstate 70 corridor use proprietary M/A-COM 800 MHz radio systems, interlinked through a StarGate™ system. The State of Colorado operates the CCNC, a P25-based 800 MHz system serving state and local agencies, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains. A M/A-COM NetworkFirst™ gateway provides limited connectivity between these regional systems. The estimated $100 million investment in Enhanced Digital Access Communications System (EDACS) equipment means migration will take many years. In the interim, grant-funded subscriber equipment with P25 mode for the M/A-COM systems is being purchased.
