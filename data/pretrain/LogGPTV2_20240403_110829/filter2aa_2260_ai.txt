The Denver UA (established in July 2003) has created a communications subcommittee to make key 
decisions and recommendations on interoperability.  The committee appears to be extremely active (bi-
monthly meetings) and most agencies in the UA participated in the Tactical Interoperable Communications 
Plan (TICP) process.  Despite their regular activity, no formal charter binds the group with defined missions, 
responsibilities, and authorities.  No additional steps have been taken to ensure that the work of the 
governing body is being actively adopted within the individual agencies and that agreements are put in place 
for agencies noted in the TICP.  Leaders in the Denver UA appear to be making budget decisions based on 
the communications interoperability needs of the UA as a whole, but it is unclear whether their current 
approach to prioritize and sustain funding is sufficient to support their long-term interoperability goals (e.g., 
extending solutions to other jurisdictions).  The Denver UA has completed the TICP; however, a strategic 
plan accepted by all stakeholders is not currently in place.  The Denver UA developing a strategic plan would 
ensure that the area’s communications interoperability efforts are coordinated with the State’s initiatives. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Create a formal regional governance board to manage regional multidiscipline and agency 
communications and coordinate with state interoperability efforts and plans relating to interoperability 
• 
Continue to recruit and sign-on additional participants (e.g., additional emergency medical services, and 
public support agencies such as transportation and utilities, schools, and nearby Department of Defense 
facilities) to the agreements 
• 
Develop and publish a regional strategic plan (e.g., vision, objectives, funding, procurement strategy) 
and obtain acceptance from all participants 
• 
Ensure coordination of the strategic plan, once developed, with the state’s plan  
• 
Enhance the regional interoperability funding strategy and methods to include additional long-term (e.g., 
3 to 5 years) funding sources in line with interoperability goals 
• 
Ensure buy-in for standardizing distribution of information to participating agencies 
• 
Increase the level of leadership participation in state and local jurisdictions that are outside of the city 
and county of Denver and adjoining county agencies, specifically the leadership of the Consolidated 
Communications Network of Colorado (CCNC)

represented a collaborative effort with all agencies in the area and became the model upon which numerous 
other areas based their plans.  Five training videos were also developed to help institutionalize regional 
procedures.  This degree of training on SOPs indicates a strong commitment to ensuring SOPs adoption and 
should be considered a best practice.  The UA has begun implementing National Incident Management 
System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) command and control policies and procedures, the TICP 
validation exercise demonstrated significant issues (e.g., use of proper ICS terminology, confusion about 
who was in charge of the incident or where that person was) with these procedures and therefore more 
training is recommended.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Distribute regional SOPs beyond the core city and county of Denver through training and exercise, and 
day-to-day usage  
• 
Ensure that interoperability materials (i.e., SOPs, training information) are being distributed from 
regional communications meetings to all of the jurisdictions’ first responders 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The Denver UA regularly uses its two major shared systems, and the fixed gateway system is actively 
promoted and used weekly.  Although some issues were encountered during the TICP validation exercise at 
the first responder level (e.g., radios for some agencies were not updated with appropriate channels, a radio 
cache request to dispatch was not fulfilled), the After Action Report indicated a “broad and largely effective 
use of interagency communications capabilities identified in the TICP.”  For example, gateway technicians 
demonstrated proficiency in setting up and using the gateways, and users on each of the shared systems were 
able to effectively communicate within the coverage area of their systems. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue training and exercise of interagency communications to improve the ability of users to 
interoperate seamlessly with responders from other jurisdictions  
• 
Continue training on the fixed gateway system to improve familiarity with the capability 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The City of Denver and a number of agencies, primarily along the Interstate 70 corridor, use proprietary M/A-COM 800 
megahertz (MHz) radio systems that are interlinked through a StarGate™ system that allows seamless roaming of 
approved talk groups across these systems.  The State of Colorado operates the CCNC, a Project 25 (P25)-based 800 
MHz system that serves state agencies and a number of local agencies, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains.  CCNC 
is slowly being expanded throughout the state.  A M/A-COM NetworkFirst™ gateway provides limited connectivity 
between these regional systems.  
The area’s estimated $100 million investment in Enhanced Digital Access Communications System  equipment—some 
of it very recent—means this migration will take many years.  In the interim, grant-funded subscriber equipment with a 
P25 mode for the M/A-COM systems is being purchased.

The Jacksonville Urban Area (UA) includes the City of Jacksonville and Duval County.  Because homeland 
security issues in Florida are addressed by Regional Domestic Security Task Forces (RDSTF), the UA has 
been expanded to include first responder agencies within the RDSTF Region 3 (RDSTF3) area.  The 
expanded area includes the counties of Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Clay, Duval, Flagler, Gilchrist, Levy, 
Marion, Nassau, Putnam, St. Johns, and Union.

Communications interoperability planning for the Jacksonville UA occurs within the state-defined RDSTF3 
(although Region 3 includes planning for areas in addition to the Jacksonville UA).  The RDSTF3 
communications subcommittee was in place before the development of the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP) and includes a variety of local, state, and federal public safety and support 
agencies (e.g., utilities, Florida Department of Transportation, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and U.S. 
Coast Guard).  The area has a mix of long-standing informal and formal mutual aid agreements and formal 
partnerships.  The UA has not developed an interoperability strategic plan, but is currently working to 
develop a plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP).  The Jacksonville UA reported that the RDSTF3 
would ensure that the strategic plan is consistent with statewide initiatives.  Agencies within RDSTF3 hold 
annual funding meetings to develop their budgets and procure equipment with consideration for regional 
interoperability.  Although the area established the shared system before receiving Urban Area Security 
Initiative funds and appears to have committed local resources to interoperability in the past, it is unclear 
whether future funding plans to sustain these systems are based on Department of Homeland Security grant 
monies or local resources.  Through the significant executive membership (e.g., mayor, judge) in its 
governing body, the regional government leaders have demonstrated political and fiscal support.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider distributing a formal charter to all participating agencies 
• 
Establish processes to develop and review agreements (e.g., usage agreements, memoranda of 
understanding) at least every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or upgrades   
• 
Develop and document a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance that takes into account a long-term (e.g. 3 to 5 years) 
communications funding strategy (in addition to grants) 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met

equipment.  The Jacksonville UA has been implementing the National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for more than 6 months.  Despite such a recent implementation, 
the participants were proactive and demonstrated proficiency with many command and control aspects 
related to interoperable communications during the exercise (e.g., designating both a Communications Unit 
Leader and communications technician), but could benefit from further NIMS/ICS training. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Document and distribute regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) and put 
them into practice through regular training (e.g., in-service refreshers and basic training courses), 
exercises, and usage  
• 
Consider developing policy on avoiding use of commercial services (e.g., cellular telephones) for 
mission-critical communications 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance 
Usage: Advanced Implementation 
The Jacksonville UA primarily uses nine local and state shared systems for day-to-day interoperability and 
gateway systems (e.g., Florida Interoperability Network [FIN]) for interagency communications.  The UA 
has demonstrated proficiency in using these resources during real-world events (e.g., Super Bowl XXXIX 
and multiple hurricanes throughout the area and state).  Jacksonville officials indicated that further training is 
needed on how to best access and use communications and response resources that exist beyond the area 
(i.e., the State of Florida’s FIN and Florida’s Mutual Aid Resources usage process).  The TICP validation 
exercise was large in scope and, despite a few minor problems (e.g., interrupted transmissions on shared 
channels because most responders were on one channel, and use of individual talk groups instead of 
broadcasting on a shared channel), the participants demonstrated that they can effectively communicate 
among agencies to handle a large-scale incident. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Encourage training on Mutual Aid Resources specific to interoperable communications and the FIN 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Technology Overview    
The Jacksonville UA is supported by approximately 18 separate radio systems that include M/A-COM, Motorola, and 
EF Johnson conventional and trunked systems.  These systems operate in the very high frequency (VHF), ultra high 
frequency, and 800 megahertz (MHz) bands. The City of Jacksonville operates an 800 MHz, Motorola SmartZone™, 
mixed mode system.  Regional interoperability is supported by the FIN, the Statewide Law Enforcement Radio System 
(SLERS), cached radios, shared channels, and gateways.  Statewide interoperability is achieved through the use of the 
SLERS and FIN.  In conjunction with the Department of Justice, the Jacksonville UA has implemented a VHF repeater 
system using ACU-1000 fixed gateways to connect the Duval County First Coast 800 MHz system to the VHF systems 
used by federal agencies in the area. Of the 227 fixed gateways that are part of the FIN, approximately 30 are in the 
Jacksonville UA, along with approximately 11 mobile gateways.  The planned 2007 grant request process includes 
initiatives to upgrade the Duval County First Coast 800 MHz system to a Project 25-compliant system and to acquire a 
transportable radio system equipped with a collapsible tower assembly.

As noted in the exercise After Action Report, “it is clear…that there is a high degree of cooperation and 
coordination among the agencies in the Miami area.”  This cooperation clearly supports the UA’s ability to 
excel across SOPs and usage, but does not provide a formalized structure for longer term interoperable 
communications planning.  For the purpose of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), the 
Miami UA has been expanded to include the SERDSTF, which is a formal body established by the State of 
Florida to address broad homeland security issues.  Within the SERDSTF, the communications working 
group has the responsibility for recommending interoperability initiatives to be addressed through federal 
grants in the area.  Despite the SERDSTF formalized processes to collect input from the communications 
working group, there doesn’t appear to be a charter formalizing the working group’s authority.  Individual 
agencies make budget decisions independent of its recommendations.  In addition, the documentation 
provided does not indicate that the Miami UA is conducting strategic planning specific to interoperable 
communications that would build upon the broad goals set forth in the Urban Area Homeland Security 
Strategic Plan.  The development of a more focused interoperable communications strategic plan or annex 
would facilitate longer term budget planning for the region as a whole.     
Recommendations: 
• 
Review the limitations on active membership defined in the state guidelines to facilitate participation by 
necessary public support disciplines  
• 
Document the necessary agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) to achieve regional 
interoperability, and reference all applicable agreements in the TICP and store them in an accessible 
format 
• 
Suggest development of a regional strategic plan, obtain acceptance from all participants, and suggest a 
review and clarification of the communication subcommittee’s roles and responsibilities 
• 
Continue to aggressively seek funding sources for immediate and long-term interoperability needs while, 
at the same time, developing a regional plan to budget and prioritize funding for interoperable 
communications needs 
• 
Suggest reviewing whether the current governance structure can fully support strategic planning for the 
entire area, or whether alternatives should be considered 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
The Miami UA has a long history of successfully addressing communications challenges, as demonstrated by

These SOPs have been successfully integrated into the TICP, with Miami taking the step of designing the 
TICP as an annex to its Terrorism Response Plan.  The area has disseminated these policies to all 
participating agencies and to conduct regular interoperability training.  The National Incident Management 
System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) was implemented more than 1 year ago and is integrated 
into regional SOPs.  The UA demonstrated proficiency in these areas through its TICP validation exercise.  
For example, the Incident Commander established a unified command consisting of fire, emergency medical 
services, and law enforcement personnel.  Additionally, the Communications Unit Leader was designated 
and announced to participants. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The Miami UA has demonstrated cooperation and the ability to work across all levels of government and all 
types of public safety responders.  The City of Miami and Miami-Dade County interoperate on a daily basis 
via shared channels, gateways, and shared systems despite using disparate systems.  In addition, state and 
federal agencies are regularly supported through the use of radio caches and/or gateways.  The use of 
regional equipment by local, state, and federal agencies in the TICP validation exercise was described by the 
evaluators as “exemplary” (e.g., specific instructions were distributed with the radio caches, gateways and 
the Miami City shared system were effectively used). 
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Miami UA has many agencies operating on trunked 800 megahertz (MHz) radio systems.  These systems include 
both M/A-COM and Motorola proprietary products that do not directly support interoperability.  The state is building 
out mutual aid channels in the ultra high frequency and 800 MHz bands.  The state has implemented a Voice over 
Internet Protocol solution connecting nearly all public safety answering points. Miami-Dade County has started a 
process to migrate to a Project 25-compliant radio system.  This will give the surrounding counties (Broward, Monroe, 
and Palm Beach) an opportunity to improve interoperability.  In addition, all four counties are planning on establishing 
common talk groups/interoperability channels in each radio that is capable of communicating with the neighboring 
counties.

The Tampa Bay UA, led by the recommendations of its communications governance group, has increasingly 
considered communications interoperability a priority.  Since 2003, the regional communications working 
group has been integrated within the Regional Domestic Security Task Force (RDSTF)—Region 4.  While 
the group has been successful in focusing local leaders on the issue of communications interoperability, it 
was not clear whether the RDSTF structure provides the working group with enough formal authority and 
responsibility (outside of Department of Homeland Security grant decisions) to be effective in activities such 
as recruitment of state and federal representatives, development of formal agreements, and establishment of 
strategic plans.  Published agreements exist to facilitate interoperability among some agencies.  A strategic 
planning process is in place, but no regionally agreed-upon document has been produced and published to 
address present and future strategic interoperability efforts or to consider long-term funding strategies that 
address operating costs and funding sources in addition to grant funds.   
Recommendations:
