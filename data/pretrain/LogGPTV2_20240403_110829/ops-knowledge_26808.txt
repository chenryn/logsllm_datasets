User: I'm sure this is a easy question, my Google-fu is obviously failing me.
How do I mount a filesystem using Python, the equivalent of running the shell command mount ...?
Obviously I can use os.system to run the shell command, but surely there is a nice tidy, Python interface to the mount system call.
I can't find it. I thought it would just be a nice, easy os.mount().
Assistant: Badly, mounting and unmounting belongs to the things that are highly system dependent and since they are

rarely used and
can affect system stability

There is no solution that is portable available. Since that, I agree with Ferdinand Beyer, that it is unlikely, a general Python solution is existing.
