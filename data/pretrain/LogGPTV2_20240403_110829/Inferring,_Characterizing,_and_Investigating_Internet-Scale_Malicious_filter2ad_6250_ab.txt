# Inferring and Characterizing Compromised IoT Devices

## A. Obtained Data
### 1. IoT Device Information
Obtaining technical information about Internet-wide IoT devices deployed in consumer and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) environments is challenging due to privacy and logistical constraints. Additionally, there are limited effective fingerprinting techniques for identifying IoT devices solely through network traffic. Despite these challenges, we utilized a near real-time IoT database provided by Shodan [30], which conducts large-scale active measurements to identify and index Internet-facing IoT devices.

We collected data on approximately 331,000 IoT devices from over 200 countries, spanning both consumer and CPS domains. Consumer IoT devices include wireless access points, routers, IP cameras, printers, network storage media, satellite TV boxes, and digital video recorders (DVRs). CPS IoT devices, used in industrial and automation operations, include programmable logic controllers (PLCs), remote terminal units (RTUs), and other smart equipment used in industrial control systems (ICS), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and distributed control systems (DCS).

Our dataset includes:
- **Consumer IoT Devices**: Approximately 181,000 devices, with the following distribution:
  - Routers: 46.9%
  - Printers: 29.1%
  - IP Cameras: 18.3%
  - Network Storage Media: 4.6%
  - Other: 1.1%

- **CPS IoT Devices**: Approximately 150,000 devices supporting 31 industrial/control automation protocols/services. These devices are used in various industries, including building automation, power generation and distribution, control systems, plant/factory automation, oil and gas transportation, and embedded IoT communications.

As shown in Figure 1a, the United States hosts the largest number of IoT devices (25%), followed by the U.K. (6%), Russia (5.9%), and China (5%). The top 15 countries account for about 69% of all IoT devices. In most of these countries, the number of consumer IoT devices is higher than those in CPS, except in China, France, Canada, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Spain.

### 2. Network Telescope Data
Darknet data consists of one-way traffic directed towards routable, allocated yet unused IP addresses (dark IP addresses). Since these IP addresses are not associated with any services, any traffic targeting them is unsolicited. Darknet data typically includes scanning, backscatter, and misconfiguration traffic.

We analyzed over 5TB of darknet traffic from April 12-18, 2017, obtained from the UCSD real-time network telescope data maintained by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) [32]. This data source captures over a billion packets per hour, with about 16.7 million globally routed destination IPv4 addresses. The processed darknet traffic is stored in "flowtuple" files, containing source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocol, TTL, TCP flags, IP length, and total number of packets.

Due to incomplete data on April 18, we excluded that day from our analysis, resulting in 143 hours of analyzed darknet data from April 12-17, 2017.

## B. Inferring and Characterizing Unsolicited IoT Devices
To infer compromised IoT devices, we developed a correlation algorithm that uses IP header information to associate the obtained IoT device data with darknet flows. Our analysis identified 26,881 compromised IoT devices, with 57% being consumer IoT devices and 43% being CPS IoT devices.

Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of daily discovered compromised IoT devices over the 6-day analysis period. On the first day, slightly over 12,000 (46%) compromised devices were correlated with the darknet data. For the remaining days, we discovered an average of about 2,900 newly compromised devices per day.

The compromised IoT devices were located across 161 countries, with the highest numbers in Russia (24.5%), China (8.6%), and the U.S. (8.1%) (Figure 1b). Notably, while the U.S. and the U.K. host more IoT devices, Russia and China have a higher percentage of compromised devices. Countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Turkey, Ukraine, and India, not among the top 15 in terms of deployed IoT devices, are among the top 15 with the most compromised devices.

### 1. Compromised IoT Devices in Consumer Realms
We identified 15,299 compromised consumer IoT devices across 145 countries, with the highest percentage in Russia (32%), followed by the U.S. (9%), Indonesia (4%), and Thailand (4%). These devices were connected via 1,762 different ISPs, with the Russian ISP "JSC ER-Telecom" hosting the highest percentage (27.6%).

The types of compromised consumer IoT devices are:
- Routers: 52.4%
- IP Cameras: 25.2%
- Printers: 18%
- Network Storage Media: 3.6%
- TV Boxes/DVRs: 0.5%
- Electric Hubs/Outlets: 0.1%

### 2. Compromised IoT Devices in CPS Realms
We identified 11,582 compromised CPS IoT devices across 136 countries, with the highest percentages in China (17%), Russia (14.8%), Korea (8.3%), and the U.S. (6.9%). These devices were associated with 2,279 different ISPs, with "Rostelecom" (Russia) hosting the highest percentage (4.5%).

The top 10 operated services/protocols by compromised CPS IoT devices include:
- Telvent OASyS DNA: 20%
- SNC GENe: 18.3%
- Niagara Fox: 13.4%
- MQ Telemetry Transport: 12.9%
- Ethernet/IP: 12.8%
- ABB Ranger: 9.1%
- Siemens Spectrum PowerTG: 5.9%
- Modbus TCP: 5.5%
- Foxboro/Invensys Foxboro: 5.1%
- Foundation Fieldbus HSE: 3.0%

These services are not mutually exclusive, and an IoT device may support multiple protocols. The presence of compromised devices in critical CPS environments, such as oil and gas transportation, power utilities, and manufacturing plants, is particularly concerning.

## IV. Characterizing Unsolicited Traffic from Internet-Scale IoT Devices
We observed approximately 141.3M packets generated by 26,881 compromised IoT devices, with a daily mean of 23.5M packets. On average, 10,889 compromised IoT devices generated traffic towards the darknet daily, with slightly more active consumer IoT devices (53%).

Consumer IoT devices, representing 57% of all compromised devices, generated more packets (approximately 62M) compared to CPS IoT devices (approximately 50M). The Mann-Whitney U test indicated that CPS devices generated significantly more packets (p < 0.0001), likely due to their more powerful processing capabilities.

### A. Unsolicited UDP Traffic
UDP packets represent about 10.4% of all traffic generated by compromised IoT devices, with slightly more UDP packets generated by consumer IoT devices. UDP packets are often used for port scanning and DoS attacks. We observed about 13M UDP packets generated by 25,242 compromised IoT devices, with 60% being consumer IoT devices generating 63% of all UDP packets.

Compromised consumer IoT devices targeted an average of about 29,000 ports and more destination IP addresses hourly compared to CPS IoT devices (Figure 5).

This analysis provides insights into the nature and characteristics of unsolicited traffic generated by compromised IoT devices, highlighting the need for robust security measures and policies.
