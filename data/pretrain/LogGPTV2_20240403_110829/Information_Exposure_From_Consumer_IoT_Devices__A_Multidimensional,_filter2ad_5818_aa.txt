ABSTRACT
Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly found in every-
day homes, providing useful functionality for devices such as TVs,
smart speakers, and video doorbells. Along with their benefits come
potential privacy risks, since these devices can communicate infor-
mation about their users to other parties over the Internet. However,
understanding these risks in depth and at scale is difficult due to
heterogeneity in devices’ user interfaces, protocols, and functional-
ity.
In this work, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of infor-
mation exposure from 81 devices located in labs in the US and
UK. Through a total of 34,586 rigorous automated and manual con-
trolled experiments, we characterize information exposure in terms
of destinations of Internet traffic, whether the contents of com-
munication are protected by encryption, what are the IoT-device
interactions that can be inferred from such content, and whether
there are unexpected exposures of private and/or sensitive informa-
tion (e.g., video surreptitiously transmitted by a recording device).
We highlight regional differences between these results, potentially
due to different privacy regulations in the US and UK. Last, we
compare our controlled experiments with data gathered from an in
situ user study comprising 36 participants.
1 INTRODUCTION
Consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices are gaining popularity
(expected to number 20 billion by 2020 [13]), offering services such
as personal digital assistants, home security, and climate control.
By combining rich sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, motion
sensors) and Internet connectivity, these devices have the potential
to learn and expose extensive information about their users and
their surrounding environment. Much of this information has ma-
jor privacy implications, e.g., when devices surreptitiously record
audio [9, 48] and user’s TV viewing habits [32], then share this infor-
mation over the Internet with device manufacturers and unknown
third parties in different countries with different privacy regula-
tions. As most of these devices lack any interfaces that indicate
information exposure, there is an urgent need for research that pro-
vides transparency into such exposure at scale, and that identifies
relevant privacy implications within different jurisdictions.

There are several key challenges that limit our understanding
of information exposure from IoT devices and their privacy impli-
cations. First, IoT device ecosystems are generally closed, hence
ground truth about information exposure is not readily available.
In particular, for the vast majority of devices in our experiments, it
is not feasible to modify the device firmware (e.g., to conduct taint
tracking) and/or use man-in-the-middle techniques to decrypt TLS
connections (e.g., to identify personal information exposed in plain-
text). In the absence of ground truth, we must develop strategies to
analyze information exposure; namely, we focus on using inferences
based on information contained in (potentially encrypted) network
traffic flows. Second, characterizing IoT information exposure at
scale is cumbersome: it requires manually setting up large numbers
of devices, using carefully controlled interactions with them, and
capturing the salient network traffic they generate. Unlike in the
mobile and web environments, where information exposure analy-
sis is facilitated by existing emulation and automation tools, there is
a need for new techniques for automating IoT device experiments,
gathering their data, and analyzing them. Third, all previous studies
focused on information exposure based on interactions with IoT
devices from a research team in one jurisdiction. There is a need
to understand how the same devices behave in jurisdictions with
different privacy laws, and when used by larger numbers of users.
In this paper, we address these challenges by providing an in-
depth analysis of information exposure from 81 devices located in
our labs in the US and UK. Through rigorous automated and man-
ual controlled experiments, we characterize information exposure
in terms of destinations of Internet traffic, whether the contents
of communication are protected by encryption, what are the IoT
device interactions that can be inferred from such contents, and
whether there are unexpected exposures of private and/or sensitive
information (e.g., video surreptitiously transmitted by a recording
device). Further, we determine whether there are regional differ-
ences between these properties, as the privacy regulations in the
US (enforced by the FTC) and UK (GDPR) can have substantial
impact on data collection. Last, we compare our controlled experi-
ments with data gathered from an in situ uncontrolled experiment
comprising 36 participants.
The highlights of our research findings include the following.
Using 34,586 controlled experiments, we find that 72/81 devices
have at least one destination that is not a first party (i.e., belonging
to the device manufacturer), 56% of the US devices and 83.8% of
the UK devices contact destinations outside their region, all devices
expose information to eavesdroppers via at least one plaintext
flow, and a passive eavesdropper can reliably infer user and device
behavior from the traffic (encrypted or otherwise) of 30/81 devices.

by IoT devices. This list is not exhaustive; rather, we focus on base-
line information exposure detectable using controlled experiments
and network traffic analysis.
• Stored data. This can include device identifiers and personally
identifiable information given by the user during device activa-
tion, activity logs, device state, etc.
• Sensor data. This consists of information obtained by the sen-
sors of an IoT device, e.g., motion detection, video surveillance
footage, audio recording.
• Activity data. This comprises information about how a user
interacted with a device (e.g., via an app on a mobile device or a
button on the IoT device) and what functionality of the device
has been used (e.g., toggling a light).
Parties to which information is exposed. When informa-
tion is exposed by an IoT device, it is explicitly shared with the
destination of its IP traffic and implicitly shared with any party
passively observing its network traffic. We begin by defining first,
support, and third parties based on the owner of the IP address being
contacted by an IoT device.
• First party. Manufacturer of the IoT device or a related company
responsible for fulfilling the device functionality.
• Support party. Any company providing outsourced computing
resources, such as CDN and cloud providers.
• Third party. Any party that is not a first or support party. This
includes advertising and analytics companies.
In addition to the destination of IP traffic, we consider network
eavesdroppers that can passively observe information exposed by
IoT devices, such as the device’s Internet service provider (ISP).
A “non-first party” is defined as any sup-

port party, or any third party. To understand whether information
exposure has privacy implications, we consider:
• any personally identifiable information (PII) contained in net-
work traffic and exposed to a non-first party;
• any recordings of users (audio/video/image) or user activity
(motion sensors, television viewing habits) exposed to non-first
parties, or exposed to a first party in a way that is neither dis-
closed nor expected by an average user;
• any collection of network traffic that allows a non-first party to
observe devices in a home, when they are used, and how they
are used (e.g., for profiling users).
2.2 Goals
In this section, we define our key research questions concerning
different information exposures.
RQ1: What is the destination of network traffic?
Communication with third parties can be a privacy concern because
such parties can track information about users, possibly with the
intent to monetize the data (e.g., through ads). Moreover, support
parties that serve multiple IoT devices (including those from dif-
ferent manufacturers) may gain detailed visibility into activities
within a home. Finally, data traversing international boundaries
may be subject to different privacy laws, including lawful intercept
regulations.
RQ2: To what extent is the traffic encrypted?

apartment that contains a large set of consumer IoT devices.
To understand how the devices behave outside of controlled
experiments, we made the US lab devices available to 36 participants
for six months in an IRB-approved user study, where such devices
are used in a studio-apartment setting (see Fig. 1). At the end of the
study, we found cases of devices exhibiting unexpected behaviors.
For example, a video doorbell sends video recordings to its service
provider based on movement sensors, without any notification or
consent from recorded parties.

• Using the above testbed features to analyze destinations of net-
work traffic, measure what information is exposed to other par-
ties over the Internet, evaluate how well device interactions can
be predicted based on network traffic.
• Analyzing idle traffic to detect unexpected device activity.
To facilitate additional research into consumer IoT devices, and to
help scale analysis to additional jurisdictions, we make our IoT mea-
surement and analysis code and data from controlled experiments
publicly available at https://github.com/NEU-SNS/intl-iot.
2 DEFINITIONS AND GOALS
This work measures network activity and corresponding informa-
tion exposure (defined in §2.1) from popular consumer IoT devices.
In particular, we focus on characteristics of the destinations of their
IP traffic, whether such traffic is protected via encryption, and what
are the potential privacy implications of this exposure. We define
our key research questions and privacy concerns in §2.2.

study, we define three categories of information that can be exposed

Use of encryption can prevent exposure of sensitive information
to eavesdroppers, while lack of encryption could expose the iden-
tity of a device, interactions with the device, and other sensitive
information.
RQ3: What data is sent in plaintext?
When plaintext network traffic contains sensitive data (see §2.1),
we consider it a privacy concern. Examples include personally
identifiable information (name, location, e-mail address), devices
identifiers, and credentials that can be used for unauthorized access
to a device and/or its data.
RQ4: What content is sent using encryption?
While traditionally considered to provide confidentiality, encryp-
tion alone does not prevent the exposure of sensitive information.
For example, sensitive data may be exposed to third party via en-
cryption, or an eavesdropper may reliably infer the devices types
and activities based on encrypted traffic patterns and plaintext
protocol information (e.g., TCP/IP headers, TLS handshakes).
RQ5: Does a device expose information unexpectedly?
This research question is inspired by recent reports indicating that
smart speakers surreptitiously and continuously recorded audio
and streamed it their providers [9, 48]. More generally, we focus
on sensitive information (e.g., user recordings) that the user ex-
pects to be exposed only via explicit interaction (e.g., keywords for
smart speakers, doorbell ringing for video doorbell). This becomes
a privacy concern when it is exposed to any party—even a first
party—when a user did not intentionally trigger this exposure.
RQ6: Does the device’s location (jurisdiction, location of net-
work egress) impact information exposure?
IoT devices may be permitted to expose more or less information de-
pending on regional regulations (e.g., GDPR in the EU). Differences
in exposure for the same devices located in, or whose network traf-
fic egresses out of, different jurisdictions may indicate adaptation
to local laws.
2.3 Non-Goals
Unmodified devices. We use only unmodified devices in our
experiments. Modifying devices or their firmware may reveal ground
truth about information exposure, but doing so is not scalable to
large numbers of devices (and not feasible with many of them).
No use of MITM. We do not man-in-the-middle (MITM) TLS
connections to reveal the plaintext content of encrypted traffic. Our
preliminary work on this topic showed that using MITM most of
the time fails and, when successful, it did not reveal much additional
useful information. Worse, MITM attempts often affected device
functionality and behavior (i.e., devices would malfunction due to
TLS connection rejection). Since MITM affected the validity of our
results by changing device behavior, we opted not to do so for this
study.
No companion apps traffic. We capture all network traffic in
our labs, including those from companion apps used to interact with
IoT devices. However, since we found little additional information
exposure beyond what has been found using prior techniques [23,
35, 37], we focus only on the traffic generated by IoT devices.
Incompleteness. We cannot identify all information exposed,
privacy-related or otherwise, from the IoT devices in our tests.
Further, we cannot quantify the privacy risk for the information
exposure we measure, because risk is subjective and we often lack
ground truth. Rather, we focus on information exposed, potential
privacy implications, and case studies of unexpected exposure of
sensitive data.
3 DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY
This section covers our data collection methodology. We describe
the devices under test, the labs in which we conduct experiments,
and the experimental methods we use to capture information expo-
sure from the devices. Collectively, we conduct 34,586 repeatable
experiments on 81 devices in two labs (one in the US at Northeastern
University’s Mon(IoT)r Lab and one in the UK at Imperial College
London) over one month, and include six months of data gathered
from an ongoing IRB-approved study involving 36 participants.
3.1 IoT Devices
Our analysis covers 81 IoT devices with IP connectivity: 46 pur-
chased from US stores (US devices) and deployed in our US testbed,
35 purchased from UK stores (UK devices) and deployed in our UK
testbed. There are 26 common devices across the two labs (i.e., a
device with a given model name is in both labs). The devices belong
to the following categories (summarized in Table 1): cameras (secu-
rity cameras and video doorbells), smart hubs (home automation
devices which act as bridges for non-IP IoT devices, such as Zig-
bee, Z-wave, and Insteon devices), home automation (smart lights,
outlets, and thermostats), TVs (actual TVs and TV dongles), au-
dio (smart speakers with voice assistant), and appliances (fridges,
cleaning appliances, cooking appliances, weather stations).
We selected devices based on the following factors: First, we
picked devices that cover a broad range of categories. Second, for
each category of device we searched popular retail websites (e.g.,
Amazon) for availability and selected based on price, popularity, and
customer ratings, much like we expect an average consumer would
do when buying an IoT device. Third, we biased our selection toward
devices that are both available to the US and UK market to enable
direct comparison of device behaviors in different jurisdictions.
Fourth, we acquired several wireless devices (light bulbs, smart
locks, light switches) that require smart hubs to use Internet so we
can test those hubs.
3.2 Testbeds
The devices are deployed in testbeds in the US and UK, using iden-
tical data-collection and experiment infrastructure.
Both testbeds include a server that provides network

connectivity and data collection. The server in each testbed is con-
figured identically, consisting of a Linux server running Ubuntu
18.06 with two wired network interfaces (one for the Internet con-
nectivity with a public IP address, one for the IoT devices under
test using a private network address space), and two Wi-Fi adapters
bridged with the wired IoT network for the wireless IoT devices
under test (one for 2.4GHz devices and one for 5GHz devices). Mul-
tiple wired IoT devices are connected to the wired IoT network
using a network switch. IoT devices communicate with the public
Internet via a standard NAT implemented at the server.
To test the impact of egress IP address on information exposure,
we configured VPN tunnels that connect the US lab to the UK lab
and vice versa. Network traffic traverses these tunnels only during
experiments labeled VPN.
