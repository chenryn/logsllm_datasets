Mike's been talking about introducing OGNL support. Seems like a nice idea to
me, though not really feasible for the 1.0 release I think. But hey, let's put
it in here so we won't forget...
Mike's mail (December 2nd):

Or an even better idea... how about supporting OGNL within the Spring config
files? (like Xwork does)
This would be _awesome_ and I just found a second use case for it (the very
minute Rob's email came in).
My use case - Maps.
The Map syntax is nice, but not very useful in practicality I'm finding as the
key and value of the map are usually related, for instance I often want to put
a list of referenced beans into a map, with ref.getName() (or some  
method) called for the key.
At the moment I have to add a setBeans(List) method to my class, and then in
that setter iterate and add to a map - smelly!
If we allowed OGNL expressions, it would be very simple to do this in the
config file itself:
$referencedBean.name  
... More entries  
I'm sure there are a million other places where OGNL would be useful too, but
AFAIK the above can't be done _without_ it?
Or have I just been at this desk far too long?
