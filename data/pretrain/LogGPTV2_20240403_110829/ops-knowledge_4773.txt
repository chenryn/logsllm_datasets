User: I am relatively new to python. I am trying to call a python file "plotting.py" in another file "main.py". To execute the "plotting.py" file the path should also be given as argument.
So in the "main.py" I have executed so
z='Stream 20170424 15_20_25_856'
os.system('python plotting.py '+z)
Where variable z is the name of the folder and this name, in general, contains the whitespaces and when I execute the "main.py" it gives an error. But when I replace the whitespaces in the folder name with _ and change the variable z accordingly and execute the "main.py" it executes without an error. But I cannot change the name of the folder every time. So is there any possibility to execute the code changing the folder name and giving the variable z has mentioned?
Assistant: If you really do not want to remove the whitespaces in your folder's name, put backslashes \ before the spaces in the variable z, to espace them.
