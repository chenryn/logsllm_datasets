As a companion issue to #27538 with tensorflow 2.0.0a. Script fails with
> ValueError: Input 0 of layer dense is incompatible with the layer: its rank
> is undefined, but the layer requires a defined rank.
in the line
` layers.Dense(image_data.num_classes, activation='softmax')`  
**System information**
  * TensorFlow version:
> ('v1.12.0-9492-g2c319fb415', '2.0.0-alpha0')
using an updated script
which also works for tensorflow 1.
  * Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/hub_with_keras
**Describe the documentation issue**  
The downloaded .py script (see #27538) fails to run (it's not clear-cut if
this is a documentation issue or simply a bug) at
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      feature_extractor_layer,
      layers.Dense(image_data.num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])

If it's a doc issue, I'd love to. It could go deeper than that. The same issue
appears for the MCVE at stackoverflow:
