User: How to limit the percentage of CPU used by a certain process?
Assistant: You can use Linux cgroups to limit the percentage of CPU that a process takes up. The steps are as follows: 1. Install the cgroup tool: sudo apt-get install cgroup-bin 2. Create a cgroup group: sudo cgcreate -g cpu:/mygroup 3. Add the process to be restricted to this group: sudo cgclassify -g cpu: /mygroup <pid> 4. Set the CPU usage limit for this group: sudo cgset -r cpu.cfs_quota_us=<value> /mygroup where <pid> is the PID of the process to be limited, and <value> is the CPU usage percentage of the limit The value of <value> is multiplied by a number of the total amount of CPUs. For example, if you want to limit the CPU usage of this group to 20%, and the system has 4 CPUs, the value of <value> is 20*40000=8000. Using the above steps, you can limit the percentage of CPU occupied by a process through cgroup.
