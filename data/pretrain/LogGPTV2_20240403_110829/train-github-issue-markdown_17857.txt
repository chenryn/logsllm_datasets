**Feature Summary**

I frequently find myself wanting to execute code immediately after reviewing examples or tutorials. Hosting these examples on Google Colab would significantly facilitate this process, enabling quick execution of the code directly within a web browser. This approach is particularly advantageous for beginners who may not have prior experience with Python notebooks or command-line tools, as it eliminates the need for local setup and configuration.
