 **Feature summary**
I often feel the need to execute the code right after I see the example or
tutorials. Having the examples hosted on google colab would certainly help in
quickly running the code as well as it will allow beginners to run the code
right on the browser if they have no prior experience with python notebook or
command-line tools.
