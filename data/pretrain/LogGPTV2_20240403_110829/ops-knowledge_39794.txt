User: I'd like to upgrade the default python installation (2.5.1) supplied with OS X Leopard to the latest version. Please let me know how I can achieve this.
Thanks
Assistant: May I suggest you leave the "Default" be, and install Python in /usr/local/bin.

Download python
Unzip it
./configure
make
sudo make install

done.
Since /usr/local/bin comes before /usr/bin in the $PATH, you will invoke 2.6 when you type python, but the OS will remain stable...
