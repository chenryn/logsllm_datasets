and smartphones). We compute, for each device category, its share in terms
of number of sessions. Figure 1b shows the results. We notice that smartphones
(blue surface), have largely increased their share from 27% to 42% at the expense
of PCs. Tablets pervasiveness, reported in green, is instead rather constant. Not
shown, the evolution of daily time spent with diﬀerent devices did not changed
too much throughout the years (see Sect. 4.2 for more details).
4.2 Usage Frequency, Duration and Habits
For detailed analyses, we restrict to the last month of our dataset that does
not include nor public holidays nor measurement outages, i.e., October 2016.
We ﬁrst characterize WP sessions in terms of duration. Figure 2a shows the
empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of session duration, expressed
in minutes. The duration is larger for PCs than for tablet and smartphones.
While most of the sessions are rather short, i.e., less than 15 min for PCs and 10
for smartphones, we observe sporadic longer sessions up to more than one hour.
We now draw the attention on the number of webpages accessed during WP
sessions, whose CDF is reported in Fig. 2b. Here the diﬀerence among devices
is limited, with users accessing in median 5 or 6 webpages in a session, with
28% of them limited to one or two. However, in some cases tens of webpages
are accessed. Similarly, in Fig. 2c we report the distribution of the number of
unique websites accessed during a WP session. Results show that smartphone
users tend to focus on a single WP website at a time (78% of sessions), while
PC users are more prone to visit more websites. For all the devices, very few
sessions include visits to 4 or more diﬀerent websites. Finally, Fig. 2d reports the
number of daily sessions for an active user. The ﬁgure shows that users hardly
make repeated use of WP within a day, without diﬀerences among devices.
We next focus on the frequency of WP consumption by users over the month.
In Fig. 3 we report the CDF of number of days of activity for WP users in the
dataset. The ﬁgure indicates that the monthly frequency is generally low, with
76% of the users visiting WP 5 or less days in a month. Still, there are some
users with a reiterate usage, with 8% of them consuming WP more than 15 days.
These results conﬁrm what is found by Daspe et al. [5], who show that the 73%
of the participants to a survey access pornography no more than once or twice

dataset, we cannot estimate the number of users not consuming WP. Still, an
analysis of per-subscription traﬃc to WP is provided later in this section.

WP consumption also changes during diﬀerent time of day. Figure 4 provides
the average percentage of sessions across the 24 h of the day (red solid line). For
ease of visualization, we start the x-axis from 4am, correspondent to the lowest
value of the day. The two higher peaks are immediately after lunch time (2pm
- 4pm) and after dinner (9pm - midnight). In addition to WP traﬃc, the ﬁgure
also reports the overall trend considering all HTTP transactions, regardless their
nature (dashed blue line). Comparing WP to total traﬃc, some diﬀerences are
noticeable; the peaks do not overlap, and the latter is deﬁnitely more balanced
over daylight hours. An hypothesis for those divergences may be related to the
fact that accessing pornographic websites is likely to be a private and leisure
activity conﬁned to intimate moments. At a global scale, Pornhub service has
found similar results (See footnote 2). The average session time reported by
Pornhub for Italy is 9 min and 30 s, similar to what observed from our analysis.
We also provide a breakdown across both hours and days of the week, with Fig. 5
showing the heat-map of the percentage variations from the gross weekly average
(white color). Warmer tones register values below average, while colder ones
show values above. Notice some clear diminishing traﬃc on Saturday evening
(7pm - midnight) and some increasing traﬃc on Saturday, Sunday and Monday
morning (9am - 1pm). Indeed, many commercial activities are closed on Monday
morning in the monitored country, perhaps inﬂuencing this behavior. Again,
Pornhub data shows comparable results, with their heatmap having peaks of
traﬃc in more or less the same time frames (2pm - 5pm) and (10pm - midnight).
Considering the cumulative daily accesses, Mondays register the highest values
and Saturdays the lowest.
Finally, we provide an overall picture about the fraction of all monitored
subscribers accessing WP website. Although our dataset does not contain ﬁne-
grained details about WP pervasiveness, we can still show the fraction of sub-
scriptions where at least one user accessed WP during our period of observa-
tion. In Fig. 6, the x-axis represents the 31 days of our reference month (being
