## 1. Introduction and Motivation

Large-scale computer systems, such as cloud, IoT, and embedded environments, are transforming numerous industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education, and transportation. Billions of devices and users rely on these systems for communication, computation, and information storage, making system reliability and availability critical. These systems are increasingly adopting distributed computing paradigms to enhance flexibility, but this also significantly increases their complexity.

Due to the inherent complexity and potential weaknesses in software and hardware, these systems are prone to failures. Studies have shown that such failures can lead to decreased reliability, high financial costs, and impacts on critical applications [8, 24, 26]. Therefore, maintaining control and ensuring a high quality of service (QoS) is essential.

Major service providers recognize the need for always-on services with high availability and have already deployed measures such as site reliability engineers and DevOps. However, the scale and complexity of these systems are reaching a point where manual operation becomes infeasible. Operators are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence tools for automation in various tasks, including system monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and recovery.

Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is an emerging interdisciplinary field at the intersection of machine learning, big data, streaming analytics, and IT operations management. AIOps aims to become the future standard for IT operation management. To achieve this, AIOps faces several challenges:

1. **Integration**: Combining research branches from fields like software reliability engineering.
2. **Modeling**: Developing novel techniques to understand the dynamics of different systems.
3. **Assessment**: Establishing methods to evaluate time horizons and uncertainty for SLA violations, early problem detection, autonomous remediation, decision-making, and optimization.
4. **Interpretability**: Ensuring models are understandable and interpretable to build trust between tools and domain experts.

Addressing these challenges will accelerate the adoption of AIOps, increase interest in the field, and contribute to the development of fully autonomous IT systems.

The primary goal of the AIOps workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and industry to share their experiences, results, and ongoing work. The workshop aims to strengthen the community and unite efforts to solve the main challenges facing the field. Emphasizing openness and reproducibility will significantly boost research in this emerging area.

## 2. The Landscape of AIOps

AIOps offers a wide and diverse set of tools for various applications, from efficient resource management and scheduling to complex failure management tasks such as failure prediction, anomaly detection, and remediation. However, being a recent and cross-disciplinary field, AIOps remains largely unstructured. Existing contributions are scattered across different conferences and use varying terminologies, making it difficult to search and collect relevant papers.

In the workshop, Notaro et al. [18] presented an in-depth analysis of AIOps-related work to address these limitations. They identified and extracted over 1000 AIOps contributions through a systematic mapping study, enabling the identification of common trends, problems, and tools. The study highlights the distribution of papers in a presented taxonomy (Figure 1).

**Figure 2:**

Notaro et al. observed that more than half of the items (670, 62.1%) are associated with failure management (FM). The most significant contributions are in online failure prediction (26.4%), failure detection (33.7%), and root cause analysis (26.7%). The remaining resource provisioning papers primarily support resource consolidation, scheduling, and workload prediction.

Temporal trends show an increasing interest and growing number of publications in AIOps. Failure detection has gained particular traction in recent years, with 71 publications in the 2018-2019 period, surpassing the entire resource provisioning macro-area (69 publications in the same timeframe). Root cause analysis (39) and online failure prediction (34) follow, while failure prevention and remediation have the fewest contributions (11 and 5, respectively).

## 3. Summary of the Studies

This section consists of three parts. In the first part, we briefly describe six papers on anomaly detection from system data. In the second part, we discuss papers on fault localization and root cause analysis. Finally, in the third part, we present novel research directions in AIOps.

### 3.1 Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection from system data is one of the most common tasks [9, 10, 16, 17, 23, 27]. The main goal is to identify observations that are likely not part of the standard system behavior. If these points lead to system failures, they are referred to as anomalies. At the workshop, six papers on anomaly detection from system data were accepted, covering both numerical and textual data. The methods range from traditional machine learning techniques to deep learning approaches.

- **TELESTO: A Graph Neural Network Model for Anomaly Classification in Cloud Services** [19]
  - Scheinert and Acker propose a novel graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) architecture, TELESTO, for detecting and classifying anomalies in resource monitoring data streams within large IT systems. TELESTO outperforms two alternative GCNN architectures in evaluations on synthetic anomalies injected into a cloud testbed.

- **Towards Runtime Verification via Event Stream Processing in Cloud Computing Infrastructures** [7]
  - Cotroneo et al. present a method for runtime verification of cloud computing infrastructures by analyzing event streams. General rules representing normal system execution are created and used to verify the system and detect potential anomalies. Preliminary evaluations were performed on OpenStack.

- **Online Memory Leak Detection in the Cloud-based Infrastructures** [12]
  - Jinda et al. introduce the Precog algorithm for online memory leak detection in cloud-based infrastructures. It observes memory resource allocation over time and compares patterns with a knowledge base of known normal patterns. Significant deviations are labeled as anomalies. Evaluations on synthetic memory leak data show promising results.

- **Anomaly Detection at Scale: The Case for Deep Distributional Time Series Models** [2]
  - Ayed et al. introduce a new methodology for detecting anomalies in time-series data, particularly for monitoring the health of (micro-)services and cloud resources. Instead of modeling time series consisting of real values or vectors, the study proposes modeling time series of probability distributions. This approach is applied to scenarios where data is generated by requests coming into a service, aggregated at a fixed temporal frequency. Results show superior accuracy on synthetic and real-world data.

- **SLMAD: Statistical Learning Based Metric Anomaly Detection** [20]
  - Shahid et al. present a time series anomaly detection framework called Statistical Learning-Based Metric Anomaly Detection (SLMAD), which detects anomalies from key performance indicators (KPIs) in streaming time-series data. The method includes a three-stage pipeline: time series analysis, dynamic grouping, and model training and evaluation. Experimental results show that SLMAD accurately detects anomalies on several benchmark datasets and Huawei production data while efficiently using resources.

- **Using Language Models to Pre-train Features for Optimizing Information Technology Operations Management Tasks** [15]
  - Liu et al. propose using language models to pre-train relevant features from domain data occurring in IT-operation tasks. The paper presents a case study of detecting anomalies within log data and demonstrates that domain-specific language models outperform general-purpose trained models.

- **Multi-Source Anomaly Detection in Distributed IT Systems** [4]
  - The authors utilize joint representation from distributed traces and system log data for anomaly detection in distributed systems. The study formalizes a learning task—next template prediction—as a generalization for anomaly detection in both logs and traces.
