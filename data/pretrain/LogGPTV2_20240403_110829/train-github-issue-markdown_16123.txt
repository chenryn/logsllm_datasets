Currently the common directives (CORE_DIRECTIVES and FORM_DIRECTIVES) are
included automatically and do not need to be manually referenced in a
component's @view annotation. However this is not the case for the
TestComponentBuilder, which fails to build the component if the component uses
unreferenced common directives. An example error message is:
    {"message":"Template parse errors: Can't bind to 'ngFormControl' since it isn't a known native property...
It's possible to add these references in to the component definition, but
ideally the TCB should be able to build whatever Angular builds normally. Also
the way the TCB handles errors (calling the onrejected callback of the
promise, which I seldom see anyone binding to) means that tests can be
regarded as passing if the component fails to build:
    tcb.createAsync(testComponent).then((fixture: ComponentFixture) => {
        expect(true).toBe(false)
    })
Will pass if the TCB fails to create the component.
So proposed solution would be to make the common directives available to the
TCB.
