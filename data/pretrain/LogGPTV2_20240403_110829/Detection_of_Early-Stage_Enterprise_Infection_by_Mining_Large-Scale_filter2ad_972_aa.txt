Recent years have seen the rise of sophisticated attacks
including advanced persistent threats (APT) which pose severe
risks to organizations and governments. Additionally, new
malware strains appear at a higher rate than ever before.
Since many of these malware evade existing security products,
traditional defenses deployed by enterprises today often fail at
detecting infections at an early stage.
We address the problem of detecting early-stage APT
infection by proposing a new framework based on belief
propagation inspired from graph theory. We demonstrate that
our techniques perform well on two large datasets. We achieve
high accuracy on two months of DNS logs released by Los
Alamos National Lab (LANL), which include APT infection
attacks simulated by LANL domain experts. We also apply
our algorithms to 38TB of web proxy logs collected at the
border of a large enterprise and identify hundreds of malicious
domains overlooked by state-of-the-art security products.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The cybersecurity landscape is evolving constantly. More
sophisticated attacks including Advanced Persistent Threats
(APTs) [13], [34], [1], [2] have emerged recently targeting or-
ganizations’ intellectual property, ﬁnancial assets, and national
security information. Well-funded attackers use advanced tools
and manually orchestrate their campaigns to adapt
to the
victim’s environment and maintain low proﬁles of activity.
Additionally there are also more malware than ever before.
A whitepaper published by Panda Labs [30] found 30 million
new malware strains in circulation in 2013 alone, at an average
of 82,000 malware a day. Many of these are variants of known
malware designed to evade existing security products, such that
existing defenses, e.g., anti-virus, ﬁrewalls, intrusion detection
systems, often fail at detecting early-stage infections [26].
However, certain infection patterns still persist across dif-
ferent malware and APT families due to the typical infection
vectors used by attackers. For example, during the malware
delivery stage, victim hosts often visit several domains under
the attacker’s control within a short period of time as a result of
redirection techniques employed by attackers to protect their
malicious infrastructures [37]. After delivery, backdoors are
installed on the compromised machines to allow footholds into
the targeted organization [26], where the machines initiate out-
bound connections regularly to a command-and-control (C&C)
server to receive instructions from the attacker. Malware com-
munications commonly take place over HTTP/HTTPS, since
web trafﬁc is typically allowed by ﬁrewalls. More importantly,
domains used in the same attack campaign are often related,
sharing locality in either IP address space, time of access
or set of hosts contacting them. These patterns of infections
have been observed in targeted attacks (e.g., APT1 group [26],
Shady RAT [20], Mirage [11]), as well as botnet infections
(e.g., Zeus, Citadel [12] and ZeroAccess [23]).
In this work, we leverage these observations to detect early-
stage malware and APT infections in enterprise networks,
in particular suspicious communications to external destina-
tions initiated by internal hosts. We propose a graph-theoretic
framework based on belief propagation [32] to identify small
communities of related domains that are indicative of early-
stage malware infections. We ﬁrst restrict our attention to
trafﬁc destined to rare destinations. These are “new” domains,
not visited before by any host in the organization within an
observation window (and thus more likely to be associated
with suspicious activity), and contacted by a small number
of internal hosts. In each iteration of our belief propagation
algorithm, the rare domains are scored according to several
features and similarity with domains detected in previous
iterations. The weight of each feature used in scoring a domain
is computed using linear regression during a training stage.
Our techniques are unique in combining unsupervised learning
techniques (belief propagation), with a supervised learning
method (linear regression) for detecting new infections when
limited ground truth is available.
Our algorithm can be applied either with “hints” (starting
from “seeds” of known compromised hosts or domains), or
without (without prior knowledge of malicious activity). In the
ﬁrst case, seeds can be obtained from commercial blacklists
containing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that the enterprise
security operations center (SOC) has access to. Currently,
SOC security analysts manually investigate incidents starting
from IOCs, and we aim here to facilitate this process. In the
latter case, we ﬁrst identify automated connections indicative
of C&C activity using both enterprise-speciﬁc and generic
features. Domains labeled as potential C&C servers are used as
seeds in the same belief propagation algorithm to detect other
related domains that belong to the same attack campaign.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on two
different datasets, one containing DNS records and the other
web proxy logs. The ﬁrst consists of two months (1.15TB)
of anonymized DNS records from Los Alamos National
Lab (LANL) in early 2013. This dataset also includes 20
independent APT-like infection attacks simulated by LANL
domain experts and was released along with a challenge (APT

Infection Discovery using DNS Data [14]) requesting methods
to detect compromised internal hosts and external domains
in the simulated attacks. The challenge included “hints” of
varying details (e.g., one or multiple compromised hosts), as
well as answers for validation. Our techniques proved effective
at detecting the LANL simulated attacks achieving an overall
98.33% true detection rate, at the cost of low false positives.
Our second dataset contains two months of web proxy logs
collected from a large enterprise in early 2014 (38.41TB of
data). Through careful manual analysis in collaboration with
the enterprise SOC, we conﬁrm that a large percentage of
domains identiﬁed by our algorithms (289 out of 375) are
related to malicious or suspicious activities (with false positive
rate on the order of 10−4%). Interestingly, a large number
of them (98) are entirely new discoveries, not yet ﬂagged by
VirusTotal even several months after we detected them. This
demonstrates the ability of our techniques to detect entirely
new attacks overlooked by state-of-the-art security products.
To summarize our main contributions in the paper are:
Belief propagation framework for detecting enterprise
infection. We develop a graph-theoretic framework based
on belief propagation for detection of early-stage enterprise
infections. Given “seed” hosts or domains, we automatically
infer other compromised hosts and related malicious domains
likely part of the same campaign. Our approach uniquely
leverages relationships among domains contacted in multiple
stages of the infection process and utilizes a novel combination
of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.
Detector of command-and-control communication in en-
terprise. By exploiting novel enterprise-speciﬁc features and
combining them with other generic features of malicious
activity, we build a detector of C&C communication tailored to
an enterprise setting. Domains labeled as C&C can be seeded
in the belief propagation algorithm to detect other related
domains.
Solve the LANL challenge. We apply the belief propagation
algorithm to the LANL challenge and identify the malicious
domains in the 20 simulated APT campaigns with high accu-
racy and low false positive and false negative rates.
Evaluate on real-world data from large enterprise. We
apply our solution to a large dataset (38.41 TB) of web proxy
logs collected at an enterprise’s network border. We identify
hundreds of domains contacted by internal enterprise hosts
not detected previously by state-of-the-art security products.
Through careful manual investigation, we conﬁrm that a large
percentage (77.07% out of 375 domains) are related to var-
ious malicious or suspicious activities. While 191 domains
(50.93%) are also reported by VirusTotal (but unknown to
the enterprise), we identify 98 (or 26.13%) new discoveries
(domains not reported by VirusTotal or the enterprise).
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our goal is to detect early-stage malware and APT infec-
tion within an organization, in particular suspicious commu-
nications to external destinations initiated by internal hosts.
We describe below characteristics of common enterprise in-
fections, why existing solutions fail against such threats and
the challenges we had to overcome to detect them.

mised host. Red (darker) circles are connections to malicious
domains, and green (lighter) circles to legitimate ones.
A. Enterprise Infections
Common infection vectors used in targeted attacks are so-
cial engineering [26] and compromise of legitimate sites [40].
In the case of social engineering, attackers craft spear-phishing
email addressed to several employees within the targeted
organization including a malicious attachment or a hyperlink
to a malicious ﬁle. Attack vectors employed by mainstream
malware include spam emails, USB drives, and a variety
of web-based attacks (e.g., drive by download, clickjack-
ing, malvertising, etc.). Many of these attacks (both targeted
and mainstream) include similar stages in the infection pro-
cess [26], [20], [11], [12] depicted in Figure 1:
Delivery stage: During delivery,
the victim machine gets
the malicious payload, for example by an email attachment,
or drive-by-download attack, etc. Typically the victim visits
several malicious domains within a short time interval as a
result of redirection employed by attackers [37]. Many times,
the initial malware is generic (e.g., performs system recon-
naissance) and downloads additional second-stage malware
speciﬁcally crafted for the victim environment [39].
Establishing foothold: After delivery a backdoor is usually
installed on the victim’s machine and the attacker establishes
a foothold within the organization [26]. In almost all cases,
backdoors initiate outbound connections to evade ﬁrewalls that
block connections from outside the network. Most communica-
tions go through HTTP or HTTPs since these ports are allowed
by most enterprise ﬁrewalls [35], [28].
Command-and-control (C&C): Typically, backdoors con-
nect regularly to the command-and-control center operated by
attackers to receive further instructions and allow attackers
backdoor access into the victim environment [26], [12].
Based on a thorough analysis of many published reports,
and discussion with a large enterprise SOC, we extract several
common characteristics of enterprise infections:
Uncommon domains: Attackers tend to use domains under
their control for different stages of the campaign (e.g., delivery,
C&C) [26]. These domains are uncommon destinations, with
low volume of trafﬁc directed to them globally. Additionally,
[26] points out that attackers use more frequently domain
names rather than direct IP connections for their C&C com-
munication so that they can dynamically ﬂux the domains.
Communities of domains: A compromised host usually con-
tacts several malicious domains within a relatively short time
interval. For instance, a user clicking on an embedded link in
an email might visit the front-end attacker site, get redirected to
a site hosting malicious payload and shortly after the backdoor
is established will initiate the ﬁrst connection to the C&C

server. These domains form small communities exhibiting
similarity in connection timing, set of hosts contacting them
(if multiple hosts are infected in the same campaign) and
sometimes proximity in IP address space [19], [26].
Automated C&C communication: Backdoors typically com-
municate with C&C servers on a regular basis to allow attack-
ers access into the victim environment. In many publicized
APT campaigns (e.g., NightDragon [10], Mirage [11], Shady
RAT [20]) as well as botnet infections (e.g., Zeus, Citadel [12],
ZeroAccess [23]), C&C communication occurs at fairly reg-
ular time intervals (minutes or hours) with small amount of
randomization. We also examined malware samples provided
by Mandiant on the APT1 group. Among 43 backdoor samples,
the vast majority (39) exhibit fairly regular timing patterns.
HTTP/HTTPs Communication. The communications to
C&C servers is typically done through HTTP or HTTPs since
other ports are blocked by enterprise ﬁrewalls [35], [28].
B. Current Defenses
Enterprises deploy different security products (anti-virus,
intrusion-detection, etc.), most of which perform signature-
based detection: they extract signatures from malware samples
(e.g., MD5 of binary ﬁle) and match them against new activity.
Additionally, the enterprise SOC relies heavily on commer-
cial blacklists to block destinations with known malicious
activities. Both signature-based detection and blacklisting can
be easily evaded by attackers, e.g., by obfuscating malicious
binaries or registering new domains. However, attackers tend
to reuse code and successful
inﬁltration techniques across
different campaigns [15]. It is this observation that we leverage
to propose new behavior-based detection methods that capture
most common infection patterns reported in the literature.
C. Challenges
There were several challenges we had to overcome in
the process of developing our detection methodology. First,
security products deployed within the enterprise perimeter
record large volumes of data daily. For example,
the two
datasets we used to evaluate our system are 1.15 TB and 38.14
TB, respectively. To perform efﬁcient analysis, we describe in
Section IV-A a suite of techniques that reduce the data volume
by an order of magnitude while retaining the communication
structure between internal hosts and external domains.
Second, sophisticated attacks tend to stay ”under the radar”
and easily blend in with millions of legitimate requests. There
is an inherent tension between detecting stealthy attacks and
reducing false positives. We carefully selected parameters of
our various algorithms to achieve extremely low false positives
(on the order of 10−4%). This results in a manageable number
of incidents referred to the SOC for further analysis.
Finally,
limited ground truth is available for enterprise
infections since the only way they are identiﬁed is when they
are detected and blocked (by anti-virus, intrusion detection
tools, or blacklists). To overcome this problem, we propose
a novel combination of unsupervised and supervised learning
techniques described in Section III-A. The evaluation shows
that our approach is successful at identifying new, unknown
infections not detected by state-of-the-art security products.
III. METHODOLOGY
In this section, we provide an overview of our approach to
detecting early-stage enterprise infection. Our system analyzes
log data collected at the enterprise border on a daily basis,
maintains proﬁles of normal activity within the enterprise,
and detects malware infections by exploiting the relationship
between suspicious external destinations used in different
infection stages. We introduce our main framework based
on belief propagation here and present
the details of our
techniques in Section IV.
A. Belief propagation framework
We model the communication between internal hosts in the
enterprise and external domains with a bipartite graph having
two types of vertices, hosts and domains. An edge is created
between a host and a domain if the host contacts the domain
at least once during the observation window (e.g., one day).
The communication graph is created from either the DNS or
web proxy logs captured at the border of the enterprise.
To keep the size of the communication graph manageable
we apply a number of data reduction techniques, mainly
restricting to rare domains and hosts contacting them. Rare
domains are those contacted by a small number of hosts and
are newly observed in that enterprise’s trafﬁc (making them
more prone to suspicious activities than legitimate, popular
destinations). They are determined after proﬁling the enterprise
trafﬁc for a given period (e.g., a month) to construct a history
of destinations contacted by internal hosts.
To detect the infection patterns depicted in Figure 1, our
main insight is to apply a graph theoretic technique called
belief propagation [32]. Belief propagation is a graph inference
method commonly used to determine the label of a graph node
given prior knowledge about the node itself and information
about its graph neighbors. The algorithm is based on itera-
tive message-passing between a node and its neighbors until
convergence or when a speciﬁed stopping condition is met.
As described in Section II-A, our main goal is to detect
communities of malicious domains with similar features that
are likely part of the same campaign. We adapt the general
belief propagation framework to this task, by starting from
a seed of known malicious domains or hosts, and iteratively
computing scores for other rare domains contacted by known
compromised hosts. The score for a domain is computed based
on 1) the degree to which the domain exhibits C&C-like
behavior (described in Section IV-C), and 2) its similarity
to labeled suspicious domains from previous iterations of the
algorithm. The ﬁnal domain score is computed as a weighted
sum of features, where the weights are determined through a
supervised approach (based on linear regression). More details
about domain similarity scoring are provided in Section IV-D.
The algorithm proceeds iteratively and builds the commu-
nication graph incrementally (for efﬁciency reasons). In each
iteration, the algorithm computes scores for those rare domains
contacted by compromised hosts, and labels the domains with
the highest scores as suspicious. These domains are added
to the graph together with the set of hosts contacting them.
The algorithm terminates when the score of the top-ranking
domain is below a threshold, or when the maximum number
