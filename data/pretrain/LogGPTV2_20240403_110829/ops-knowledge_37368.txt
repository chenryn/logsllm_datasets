User: I'm going to try out turbogears however I'm on windows vista.
however due to firewall proxy problems, it seems i can't download .egg files which is required for setup turbogears to get installed in my windows environment.
I do have a bootable, or I can make a bootable Linux USB, I can try cygwin but I am not sure where to start with cygwin, so I was wondering what would solve my firewall / proxy problem of installing something like turbogears.
if it's possible, is there some non-online version of turbogears that i could just download from visiting a site and then somehow importing that non-online version into my python environment?
thanks so much!:)
Assistant: Add python to the firewall exceptions list. Just make sure you don't run any questionable code made in python, of course.
