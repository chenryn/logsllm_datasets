## Abstract

Proactive approaches to failure avoidance, recovery, and maintenance have recently attracted significant interest among researchers and practitioners in various areas of dependable system design and operation. The first PFARM workshop provided a stimulating forum for researchers from different communities to collaborate, exchange ideas, and find new solutions to the challenge of significantly improving system dependability in contemporary computing and communication systems.

### 1. Themes, Goals, and Objectives

Over the last decade, research on dependable computing has shifted from reactive to proactive-reactive fault tolerance methods. This shift is driven by the increasing complexity of systems, the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, virtualization, and dynamic updates. Proactive methods aim to increase time-to-failure and reduce time-to-repair by anticipating and mitigating potential issues based on runtime monitoring. 

The goal of this workshop is to foster collaboration among researchers working on proactive failure avoidance, recovery, and maintenance. Key themes include:

- **Runtime Monitoring:** Techniques for continuously measuring the system's state.
- **Predictive Diagnosis:** Algorithms to anticipate and diagnose upcoming problems.
- **Efficient and Effective Decision-Making:** Methods to decide which maintenance actions should be applied and when.
- **Proactive Maintenance Strategies:** Short-term and long-term strategies to minimize downtime and improve system dependability.

### 2. Main Challenges

Several challenges were addressed during the workshop, including:

- **Uncertainty in Measured Data:** How can we ensure that uncertainty in measured data does not lead to poor behavior?
- **Dynamic Environment Composition:** How do we proactively compose systems in highly dynamic environments such as cloud computing?
- **Prediction and Monitoring Relationships:** Should we focus on a "design for prediction" methodology?
- **Human Factors and Ecosystem Analysis:** How do we factor in human factors and the broader ecosystem in our analysis?
- **Diagnosis of Unseen Problems:** How do we predict and diagnose problems that have never occurred before?
- **Optimal Decision Algorithms:** How can we choose the best frequency of recoveries to minimize performance penalties while recovering from as many faults as possible?

### 3. The PFARM Karaoke

During the first edition of the PFARM workshop in 2009, a karaoke session was held to discuss the biggest challenges in proactive fault management. Some of the key questions and challenges proposed include:

- **Modeling Malicious Intruders:** How do we model malicious intruders in our proactive recovery and configuration models?
- **Building Trust with Operators:** How can we build trust with operators who are often wary of automation?
- **Benchmarking PFARM Problems:** What benchmarks can we use to evaluate PFARM problems?
- **Cost Estimation:** How can we estimate the costs of introducing proactive policies versus reactive policies?
- **Reliability Assurance:** How do we test and ensure the reliability of introduced mechanisms?
- **Data Processing and Selection:** How do we process and select relevant data from the vast amount of available data?
