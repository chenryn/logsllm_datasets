User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to detect long lived SSH sessioned I am trying to figure out a way to detect ssh sessions that have been established over a long period of time.  I seem to recall that there were ways to detect tcp connections that have been connected for a long time but I do not remember how.  I looked at Snort, even posted here about it, but I could not find a rule that would allow me to watch a ssh session over any amount of time and then only alert if it hit a specific time limit.

Can someone point me in the right direction/technology for this?

Thank you,

Assistant: I could not find an out-of-the-box solution for this, however I think this can be done by scripting a little. Here are my thoughts. 

Set up Snort to alert on TCP handshakes to SSH target ports. Have it log these alerts to a file. Also set up traffic alerts to/from SSH ports. Write these alerts to a file as well.

Then, create a script which correlates these events and alerts if a connection is alive for too long. 

A simple state machine should do the job. If the handshake alert is encounter save the from/to ip to some kind of storage (can be memory) as well as the ports and the time of the alert. Have a last seen date saved as well and update that as you see traffic between the two hosts. Check if the difference between last seen and connection established is greater than your preference.
