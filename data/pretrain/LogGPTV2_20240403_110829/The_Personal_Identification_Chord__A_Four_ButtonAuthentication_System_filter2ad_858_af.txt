robust to guessing attacks. This can be explained by the less skewed
distribution of individual taps used in PIC-free (see Figure 6). In
total, 46% of PINs contained repeating items, which can facilitate
guessing attacks that exploit repetitive item patterns. In contrast,
only 27% of PIC-free PICs contained repeating tap patterns (see
Table 8). This observation is strengthened by additional evidence
suggesting PINs may be easier to compromise: a significantly higher
number of participants reported using personal information such
as birth dates or ID numbers to compose their PINs. In contrast,
The Personal Identification Chord

PIC participants reported using rhythms and shapes as mnemonics.
This evidence suggests that PICs may be stronger against rule-based
guessing attacks that exploit personal information [5].
7.4 Implications of mandating dual-taps
The second research question in the third study sought to explore if
PIC security can be improved with policies that mandate dual-taps.
The answer is no; guessing entropy was highest for PIC-free. This
was unexpected and highlights an incorrect assumption that dual-
taps would be, proportionately, less frequently used than single taps.
The ease with which participants were able to enter many of the
dual-taps made them a frequent component of users’ PICs. Building
on the data from the third study, a more appropriate policy might be
based on encouraging users to include the most infrequently used
taps: 1+2, 2+4, 4 and 1+3. We note two of these taps are horizontal
dual-taps, suggesting participants may have been reluctant to use
this category in particular (see Table 7).
7.5 Limitations
A number of limitations impact this work. In the recall study, the
sample size is sufficient only to make predictions about guessing
entropy; larger samples would be required to fully establish it.
Furthermore, the virtual “sweet” voucher may have distorted the
participants’ PIN and PIC selection behaviors. PINs and PICs col-
lected in the study may be stronger than those used to protect real
watches. However, since the same incentive applied to all policies,
both PIN and PIC selections would have been affected in a similar
way.
8 RELATED WORK
Textual passwords are still the most popularly implemented authen-
tication method as they are easy to deploy and people are already
familiar with them [4, 16]. Indeed, even if alternative schemes such
as biometrics are used to secure a device, traditional passwords
typically remain in place as a parallel authentication system and
to maintain and manage biometric credentials, access rights and
data (e.g, Apple’s Touch ID). However, entering textual passwords
on small virtual keyboards available on mobile devices can be diffi-
cult [12, 19, 24, 28, 32]. Zezschwitz et al. [32] found that passwords
used on mobile devices are shorter and contain fewer symbols and
uppercase letters. Melicher et al. [24] also found that creating pass-
words on mobile devices takes significantly longer, and is more
error prone.
Only a few studies concentrated on the analysis of screen lock
usability for smartwatches. Nguyen and Memon [25] evaluated the
usability of popular locking mechanisms for smartwatches, and
found that conventional PIN and patterns are more usable than
the newer “draw PIN” and “voice PIN” methods. Zhao et al. [35]
conducted a similar study, focusing on how watch sizes and layouts
(square and circular) affect the usability of PINs and patterns. The
most preferred method was patterns even though 75% of partici-
pants were concerned with their finger movements on small watch
screens. They used mobile phones (and not smartwatches) and sim-
ulators to conduct that study. As far as we know, we are the first to
fully implement a smartwatch-focused password entry system, and
study its usability and security in a multi-day study.
Schaub et al. [28] evaluated the usability of textual password
entry on mobile devices. Jakobsson and Akavipat used multi-word
passphrases with auto-correction to improve the speed of password
entry [19]. Numerous graphical patterns [9, 31], and biometric
authentication schemes [2, 22] have been proposed for mobile de-
vices. Despite many screen lock schemes becoming available, PIN is
still popular: about 33.6% of mobile users use PINs [14]. Moreover,
before activating biometric authentication, most mobile devices
require users to first set up their dominant locks in the form of
PINs, passwords, or patterns [8]. Hence, the overall security is of-
ten determined by the robustness of user chosen PINs. But we also
know that most users choose easy-to-remember PINs that are vul-
nerable to dictionary attacks. Bonneau et al. [5] showed that many
users use memorable dates (e.g., birth dates) as PINs, and an effec-
tive guessing attack would involve brute-forcing PINs with dates.
The results presented in the “Remembrance Techniques” section
confirm this, showing that half of the PIN participants used their
personal information to create easily recallable PINs.
PIN complexity policies can help users choose stronger PINs.
Kim et al. [20] studied the effectiveness of numerous PIN complexity
policies, showing that enforcing a blacklist of popularly used PINs
can help users choose more secure PINs that are also memorable. As
mentioned in the “PIC policies” section, Apple uses a warning policy
to help users avoid using weak PINs like 0000, 1111, or 1234. In
contrast to existing literature on PIN complexity policies, however,
our analyses of the PIC-dual and PIC-dual-rand policies showed
that not all policies are effective in improving PIC security, and such
policies must be designed carefully to address the PIC selection
biases discovered in this paper.
9 CONCLUSIONS
The paper explores authentication on smartwatches. It first cap-
tures current opinions and behaviors via an interview study with
current watch owners. Based on their concerns about the difficulty
and inconvenience of authentication, we propose PICs, a novel
authentication input based on chorded input on four large, eas-
ily targeted buttons. Two studies then assess the value of the PIC
design. A keypress level usability study suggests that PIC perfor-
mance is modestly slower and more error prone than PIN during
standard input, but leads to fewer errors in a challenging, GUI-free
input condition. A recall study shows both PICs and PINs achieve
high recall rates and input accuracy, with PIC requiring additional
time for setup and, more modestly, for recall. Security analyses
based on an objective assessment of partial guessing entropy, and a
subjective assessment of PIN/PIC selection strategies indicate that
PICs may offer improved resistance to brute force attacks and to
attacks based on knowledge about a watch owner. Future work will
seek to establish the real-world impact of these variations by assess-
ing input performance of PIN and PIC during real smartwatch use
and also include comparisons with other common authentication
techniques such as pattern lock. We will also investigate guessing
attacks on PICs with a larger sample, capture additional data on PIC
generation strategies and explore the susceptibility of PIC entry to
other common forms of attack such as shoulder surfing.
