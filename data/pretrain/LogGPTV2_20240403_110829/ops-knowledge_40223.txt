User: How to optimize the performance of web application and keep it stable under high concurrency?
Assistant: Here are some best practices to optimize web application performance and keep it stable: 1. Caching: Use caching to reduce the load on the database and network, and cache frequently used data as much as possible. 2. Compress data: use compression algorithms to reduce the size of JavaScript, CSS and HTML files, and improve page loading speed. 3. CDN Acceleration: Upload static resources to the CDN server to speed up resource loading and reduce network request delays. 4. Code optimization: optimize JavaScript and CSS codes to minimize rendering-blocking codes. 5. Database optimization: Use appropriate indexes and query statements to reduce database query time. 6. Code asynchronization: Improve performance and maintain the stability of web applications by using asynchronous requests and JavaScript libraries. 7. Strengthen security: In the case of high concurrency, security issues should be considered, including DDoS attacks, SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks. 8. Load balancing: use load balancing and horizontal expansion technology to improve performance and scalability. 9. Performance testing: Regular performance testing is performed to ensure that the web application remains stable under high load. 10. Code optimization: optimize the performance of web applications by using multi-threading technology and asynchronous I/O technology to reduce response time.
