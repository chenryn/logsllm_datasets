I am currently using the PyDev plugin for Eclipse Luna, which is designed for Java EE development. While my Python code executes without any issues, I'm encountering errors related to built-in keywords such as `print`. The specific error message I receive is: "Undefined Variable: print".

After researching on Stack Overflow, I found that one common solution suggested was to manually configure the Python interpreter. I followed this advice and set my interpreter to point to `C:/python34/python.exe`, but unfortunately, this did not resolve the issue. Additionally, I ensured that the grammar version was set to 3.0.

Upon further investigation, I suspect that the problem may be related to Aptana rather than PyDev. When I uninstalled Aptana and installed PyDev independently, I did not encounter any problems. However, when I attempted to reinstall Aptana, it required me to uninstall PyDev first. 

To address this, I discovered a solution by installing an older version of Aptana separately from PyDev. This allowed me to have both tools working simultaneously in Eclipse Luna, resolving the initial issues with the `print` keyword.
