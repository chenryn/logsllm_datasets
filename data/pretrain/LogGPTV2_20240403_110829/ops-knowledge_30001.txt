User: I'm using the Pydev plugin for Eclipse Luna for Java EE.
The python code runs correctly, but errors are showing up for built in keywords like print. 
Error: Undefined Variable: print
I looked on stackoverflow for other answers, and the suggestions have all been to manually configure an interpreter. I changed my interpreter to point at C:/python34/python.exe, but this has not fixed the problem. I also made sure that I was using grammar version 3.0. 
Update: I think it might be a problem with aptana instead of pydev. I uninstalled aptana, and installed pydev without any issues. But when I tried to reinstall aptana, I can only do it by uninstalling pydev. I need a way to try a previous version of aptana or else a way to install aptana and pydev separately
Assistant: It seems like Eclipse Luna does not provide support for PyDev when it's installed with Aptana. I was able to install Aptana without PyDev and do a separate install of Pydev on its own and this solved the problem.
