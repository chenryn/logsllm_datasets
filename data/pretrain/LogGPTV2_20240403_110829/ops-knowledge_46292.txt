Question: "A web-based document management system allows users to upload and classify documents based on sensitivity levels. The sensitivity levels are represented in the system as a dropdown list, which is populated based on the user's role. What could be a potential vulnerability if the application's implementation is not properly secured?"
 "A": "Users with sufficient privileges are prevented from selecting certain sensitivity levels due to a misconfiguration."
 "B": "The application correctly hides the dropdown for sensitivity levels from users without sufficient privileges."
 "C": "An attacker modifies the sensitivity level of a document using an intercepting proxy, bypassing the role-based dropdown list."
 "D": "The system logs all changes to document sensitivity levels and requires administrator approval for sensitivity level changes."
Answer: C
