User: Design a network security strategy that includes aspects of network defense, vulnerability remediation, password management, and remote access control.
Assistant: The network security policy recommendations cover the following aspects: 1. Network defense: deploy firewalls, IDS, IPS and other security devices at the network entrance, and update the rule base and patches of the security devices to ensure the timely response capabilities of the devices. At the same time, properly isolate the internal network, set up a bastion host, and strictly control the user's network access rights. 2. Vulnerability repair: It is recommended to implement a vulnerability management system to discover, track and repair the loopholes in business systems, application software, operating systems, etc. in a timely manner. According to the nature of the vulnerability, formulate an emergency patch plan, daily patch plan, and regular inspection plan to sort out, manage, and track patched and unpatched vulnerabilities. 3. Password management: It is recommended to use encryption to store passwords, set reasonable password rules, force users to change passwords every 3 months, prohibit the use of simple passwords and repeated passwords, and take measures such as multiple authentication to strengthen identity authentication. 4. Remote access control: It is recommended to use encryption methods such as VPN for remote access, and limit the remote access IP range, access time and access rights, and perform identity authentication and authorization authentication for users to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. 5. Security training: Provide employees with regular network security knowledge training to improve their security awareness. At the same time, conduct safety management assessments for employees, and warn and correct those whose safety management is not in place. 6. Incident response: It is recommended to prepare a comprehensive network security emergency plan, set up a special emergency response team, organize regular exercises, and test whether the implementation effect of the plan and the operation process are reasonable. And after the incident, timely data backup, trace the source and review the situation after the event, to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
