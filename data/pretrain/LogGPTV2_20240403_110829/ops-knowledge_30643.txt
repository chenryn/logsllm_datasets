Assistant: Nginx is a high-performance open source web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy server, load balancer, HTTP cache, and security protection tools. Common application scenarios of Nginx include: 1. As a Web server: As a Web server, Nginx can handle a large number of concurrent requests, improving response speed and stability. 2. Reverse proxy server: The reverse proxy can be used to encrypt and transmit data, reduce the load pressure on the server, and improve system stability. 3. Load balancer: Nginx can perform balanced distribution of requests according to different algorithms to improve the overall performance of the system. 4. Static resource caching: Nginx can cache static resources in memory, reducing resource access delays and improving website performance. 5. HTTP cache: Through the Cache-Control in the HTTP header, Nginx can directly cache frequently accessed resources locally, improving the speed and experience of users. 6. Security protection tools: Nginx has efficient security protection functions, which can resist malicious attacks, DDoS and other attacks, and ensure the stability of system operation.
