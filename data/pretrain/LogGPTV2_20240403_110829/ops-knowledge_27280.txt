User: How can I install official elasticsearch binding for python instead of pyelasticsearch?
Haystack documentation says:

Youâ€™ll also need an Elasticsearch binding: elasticsearch-py (NOT
  pyes). Place elasticsearch somewhere on your PYTHONPATH (usually
  python setup.py install or pip install elasticsearch).

But when I install elasticsearch with pip, haystack still asks for pyelasticsearch.
Assistant: I used haystack in my last project. I checked my virtualenv and I have only 'pyelasticsearch==0.5'.
Keep in my mind that documentation can be outdated.
