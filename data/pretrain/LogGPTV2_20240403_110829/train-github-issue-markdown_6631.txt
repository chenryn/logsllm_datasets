Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-label-bootstrap-wells
has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include links to
screenshots if possible.  
Hi,
The Task: Add an h4 element to each of your
elements.  
is correct but it is marked as incomplete / incorrect. I am unable to progress
forward.  
I have attached a screenshot for visual clarification.
Thanks,
J
