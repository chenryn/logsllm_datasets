This has lost so much work in the las few days. I can't find a pattern: it
happens in different file types and there doesn't appear to be any trigger,
other than Undo.
I hit (Cmd-Z, with the keyboard), and occasionally and randomly it takes the
file back to some previous state, but it's clearly NOT the last saved state. I
believe it's the originally opened state.
If I'm not watching close, it'll happen and I miss it, then continue editing.
It leaves the file marked as "dirty", so saving after this happens will
overwrite any changes since the state it restored it to, which in one case was
a few days ago, so saving often does not help.
