User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I determine why a process is dying? On a CentOS 6.5 server I am running a very simple HTTP listener with Sinatra that exists simply to accept POST requests and pass the payload content of the POST request to another service.

I often find that the process with the PID of the Sinatra service no longer exists, with no explanation in the logs.

I have debug-level logging in the Sinatra code and still have no clues towards what is happening on the box to cause the process to die.

What can I do on the Linux side of this problem to monitor this particular process and determine what is causing it be killed?

Assistant: You could try to do

strace -p pid-number >&amp; /tmp/process.txt

Once the process has died you can study the contents of /tmp/process.txt

pid-number should be replaced with the numeric pid if the process you want to study.
