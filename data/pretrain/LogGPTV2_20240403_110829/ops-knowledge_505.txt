User: is snmp really required to manage devices ?
i'd like to script something with python to manage devices (mainly  servers), such as disk usage, process list etc.
i'm learning how to do and many article speak about snmp protocole.
I can't use, for example, psutil, or subprocess or os modules, and send information via udp ?
Thanks a lot
Assistant: The SNMP is a standard monitoring (and configuration) tool used widely in managing network devices (but not only). I don't understand your question fully - is it a problem that you cannot use SNMP because device does not support it (what does it support then?) To script anything you have to know what interface is exposed to you (if not a MIB files then what?). Did you read about NETCONF?
