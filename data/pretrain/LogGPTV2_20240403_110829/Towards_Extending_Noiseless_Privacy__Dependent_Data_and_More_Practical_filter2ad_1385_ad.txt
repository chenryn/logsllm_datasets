### Synergy of Adversarial Uncertainty and Differential Privacy

An interesting observation is the synergy between adversarial uncertainty and differential privacy methods, particularly when the sample size \( n \) is between 1050 and 1350. In this range, it is sufficient to add significantly less noise compared to the standard differential privacy approach to achieve the desired privacy parameter \( \varepsilon = 0.2 \).

### Summary of Results

To summarize our findings, we present a flowchart (Figure 6) that provides a high-level overview of how data owners can approach the problem of preserving privacy in a general manner.

1. **Assumptions about Data/Adversary?**
   - **No**: Use standard differential privacy methods (see [16]).
   - **Yes**: Initialize an adversarial model for the data vector (see Definition 5).
     - **Is data independent (D = 1)?**
       - **Yes**: Utilize adversarial uncertainty for the independent case (use Theorem 4).
       - **No**: Utilize adversarial uncertainty for the dependent case (use Theorem 5).
     - **Satisfied with privacy parameters?**
       - **Yes**: Release the aggregated statistic.
       - **No**: Enhance privacy by adding noise (use Theorem 6).

### Previous and Related Work

Our paper extends the ideas introduced in [5], where the authors proposed a new perspective on relaxing differential privacy by leveraging the uncertainty of the adversary. This contrasts with the standard differential privacy approach, which assumes that uncertainty must be injected by the data owner.

#### Randomized Mechanism and Practicality

The concept of differential privacy is inherently pessimistic, as it assumes the adversary has almost complete knowledge. This often makes differential privacy impractical, as the necessary noise addition can render the data useless. For example, in a taxation audit, adding noise to the sum of taxes paid can make it impossible to determine whether discrepancies are due to noise or tax evasion. Similar issues are discussed in [5] and [20], where the magnitude of noise required for practical cases is often too large, despite good asymptotic properties.

#### Model and Contributions

In our paper, we use the same model as [5] but present it in a more convenient form for our proofs. Our results are more detailed and non-asymptotic, making them easier to apply in practice. We also address data with limited dependencies, which was not covered in [5] except for simple examples. Additionally, we show that combining noiseless privacy with the standard approach (adding some noise) can enhance inherent randomness and achieve the desired privacy level with less noise.

#### Related Frameworks

Other related works include [4] and [24], which propose frameworks (coupled-worlds privacy and Pufferfish, respectively) for specifying privacy definitions using adversarial uncertainty. These frameworks can be instantiated in various ways, including noiseless privacy. While these papers generalize privacy definitions, our focus is on extending the types of data with good noiseless privacy parameters, introducing dependencies, and combining noiseless privacy with the standard approach.

#### Sampling and Aggregation

[26] explores sampling to enhance privacy and provides non-asymptotic guarantees. However, they focus on achieving differential privacy through k-anonymity, whereas we consider the aggregation of dependent data, which is more suitable for real-life scenarios. Our model deals with aggregated data from potentially dependent sources, and we introduce local dependencies.

#### Data Aggregation under Differential Privacy

Our results can be applied in [35], where a mechanism allows an untrusted aggregator to learn only intended statistics while maintaining differential privacy. This is achieved by combining cryptographic techniques with regular privacy-preserving methods, which can be omitted under the noiseless privacy regime.

#### Other Related Works

- [31] and [32] use different security models and assume user-to-user communication, unlike our assumption of aggregator-to-user communication.
- [20] and [8] present solutions for dynamic networks, but many protocols fail if even a single user abstains from participation.
- [2, 17, 6, 30] discuss advanced processing of aggregated data while preserving privacy.
- [1, 21] present aggregation methods that preserve privacy but do not consider dynamic changes or provide rigorous proofs.
- [29, 34] focus on confidentiality of the result without considering node privacy.
- [22, 27] discuss aggregation protocols without security or privacy considerations.
- [19, 23, 25] deal with fault-tolerant aggregation protocols in different settings.

### Conclusions and Further Work

We have provided explicit bounds for privacy parameters when utilizing adversarial uncertainty. We introduced a specific privacy model and an adversary model, and to our knowledge, this is the first work to provide non-asymptotic guarantees for privacy parameters, making the idea more practical.

Another key contribution is addressing dependent data using the notion of dependency neighborhoods. We provide privacy guarantees for any distribution with a wide class of dependencies, requiring only the size of the largest dependent subset. Our theorems are designed to be easily usable by practitioners, not just privacy experts.

We also showed how the standard differential privacy approach can be combined with inherent randomness in the data, allowing for a tradeoff between the two approaches.

#### Future Work

- **Randomness in Databases**: How should database designers decide on the level of randomness? A general method for this would be valuable.
- **Precision in Data Privacy**: We aim to find a more precise way to connect data randomness with privacy levels, possibly using min-entropy.
- **Improving δ Parameter**: Exploring ways to improve the δ parameter by adding less noise than in standard differential privacy.
