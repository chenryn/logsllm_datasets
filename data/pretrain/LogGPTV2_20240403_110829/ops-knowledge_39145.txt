User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Internet safety to protect children on a small network I support a local organisation which works with school children. The organisation has 15 Vista and Windows 7 desktops, all joined to the same workgroup. All the computers simply connect to a wireless router.

Up until now all the computers ran a single limited account. We use Windows Family Safety to protect the users on the internet and we manually restrict particular social networking sites and various other sites. 

We now have a need for users to be able to log into the computers with their own accounts. If we continued to use Windows Family Safety we would need to join each account up to the service, something we would like to avoid as this would be difficult to manage.

Are there any solutions that we can operate centrally that automatically block out known bad sites and also allow us to blacklist sites. Ideally the rules we set should be for each computer, regardless of the account.

Would love to hear your thoughts and ideas? Maybe I'm going about this all wrong and there is a better solution in the form of external hardware. Please advise.

Assistant: This might not be a solution that you're looking for, but this is an extremely easy solution and have recommended it myself in the past. Use OpenDNS.

OpenDNS has all kinds of filters and the paid version of OpenDNS will allow for faster DNS lookups and better security.

If you simply add the DNS servers to the main router on the network, it would simply assign all the computers on the network to OpenDNS's DNS servers, that is, as long as you have it to auto DHCP on every computer...

Then after that's all set up, you'll be good to go with a better DNS server and full protection. Just make sure that the settings are locked down (I'd assume they already are), so you won't have any smart ones tinkering with the DHCP settings.

As the others said, you could go with a hardware/software solution, but OpenDNS is much more cost effective as you will not need to manage the server controlling the DNS and everything else in that regards. Just takes a toll off your system administrators. 

You might want to think about blocking (if the router supports it) visiting IPs directly as some smart one could run a DNS lookup on a site and go to the IP directly. So if you're going to use a DNS solution, blocking direct access to an IP would be best.
