the secret s, and b is a base unit of time. Observe that the
length of these rehearsal intervals grows exponentially with
the number of prior rehearsals (i). Our user study provides
evidence that users can remember 4 PAO stories following the
12hr×1.5 rehearsal schedule (e.g., b = 12 hours, σs = 1.5).
If the user needs to recall the secret s in the course of a
normal login during the time interval [ti, ti+1) then we say that
this rehearsal requirement was satisﬁed naturally. If the user
does not rehearse s naturally during the interval [ti, ti+1) then
he would need to be reminded to do an extra rehearsal to ensure
that he does not forget s. Blocki et al. [12] suggested that
we quantify the usability of a password management scheme
by predicting how many extra rehearsals (XR∞) the user
would need to perform over his lifetime to remember all of
his password related secrets. The value on XR∞ will depend
on how frequently the user logs into each of his accounts (in
additions to the parameters b and σ).
We previously observed that a user could form 14 pass-
words from 4 PAO stories by adopting the Shared Cues scheme
of Blocki et al. [12]. Following Blocki et al. [12] we provide
a sense of the extra rehearsal effort necessary to remember all
four PAO stories. Table IX predicts how many extra rehearsals
(XR∞) the user would need to do over his lifetime to ensure
that he remembers all 4 of his PAO stories in expectation.
We used the parameters b = 12 hours and σs = 1.5 because
most users in our study were able to remember 4 PAO stories

by following the 12hr×1.5 rehearsal schedule. To make these
predictions we also assume that we know how frequently the
user visits each of his 14 accounts on average (e.g., daily,
weekly, monthly) and that the user’s visitation schedule is well-
modeled by a Poisson arrival process. We consider three types
of user proﬁles (Active, Typical and Infrequent).
The predictions in Table IX indicate that Active and Typical
users could maintain 14 secure passwords with minimal re-
hearsal effort. Table IX also predicts how many extra rehearsals
the user would need to do after 1.75 days (the column labeled
E[XR∞] - E[XR1.75]). We observe that most of the extra
rehearsal effort is concentrated in ﬁrst few days. After 1.75
days our Active and Typical users would most likely not need
to do any extra rehearsals over his lifetime to remember all 4
PAO stories.
Mitigating the Interference Effect: One potential down-
side of the Shared Cues password management scheme [12] is
that the more secure versions of the scheme may require users
to memorize multiple stories at once. For example, Blocki et
al. [12] suggested that users memorize 43 stories to create 110
unique passwords with a (43, 4, 1)-sharing set family. While
this scheme provides very strong security guarantees (e.g.,
an adversary who has already seen one or two of the user’s
passwords could not break any of the user’s other passwords
even in an ofﬂine attack), the user would need to memorize
at least 36 of these stories just to form the ﬁrst 9 passwords.
We observed an interference effect in our study suggesting
that users would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to memorize so many stories
at once. It is likely that the interference effect is, at least
partially, due to user fatigue (e.g., participants who memorized
four PAO stories had less mental energy to expend memorizing
each action-object pair than participants who only memorized
one or two PAO stories). One potential way to mitigate the
interference effect would be have user’s follow a staggered
schedule in which they memorize two new PAO stories at a
time. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Another
important research problem is to construct (n, (cid:96), γ)-sharing set
families that expand gracefully so that the user does not need
to memorize too many stories at the same time (e.g., for every
t we seek to minimize the number of action-object pairs that
a user would need to memorize to form the ﬁrst t passwords).
