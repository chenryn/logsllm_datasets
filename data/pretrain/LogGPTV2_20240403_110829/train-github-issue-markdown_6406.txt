If I'm not mistaken, after enabling the `_ttl` and `_timestamp` fields, one must explicitly request these fields (along with the `_source` field) in every subsequent search query to retrieve their values, especially if we intend to display them.

Is there a downside to having the `_ttl` and `_timestamp` fields automatically included with the other hit fields such as `_id`, `_index`, `_type`, and `_score`? 

It seems to me that this would be the most intuitive behavior. At least, that's what my colleague and I were expecting. We had to do some extensive research on Stack Exchange to figure out why it wasn't working as we anticipated and to understand the additional steps required.
