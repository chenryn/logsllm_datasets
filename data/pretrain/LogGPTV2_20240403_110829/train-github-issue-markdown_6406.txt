If I am not mistaken, after enabling _ttl & _timestamp, one must also then add
a request for the _ttl & _timestamp fields (and _source, otherwise, it
disappears) to (every) search request thereafter in order to get the values -
if we want to display them.
Is there a downside to having them included with the other hit fields (_id,
_index, _type, _score) automatically?
It seems to me to be the most intuitive behaviour.  
At least thats what I (and my pair) were expecting - and we had to go on a bit
of a tour of stackexchange to find out why it wasnt behaving like that what
hoops we had to jump through
