The problem is, of course, as follows:
    import names::{Alice, Bob};
    ...
    match name {
        Alice => ...,
        Bob   => ...,
        Carol => ..., //  ..., //~ WARNING unreachable pattern
    }
or:
    match name {
        Alice => ...,
        Bob | Carol => ..., //~ ERROR variable Carol not bound in all patterns
    }
We should be able to emit a hint that says something like `Maybe you forgot to
import `Carol`?`.
