### 6. Various Attack Vectors and Their Corresponding Effects

#### 7.1 Maximizing Impact
It is evident that the adversary has numerous entry points for performing various attacks, but not all entry points are equally effective in maximizing impact. For example, our experiments show that decreasing the Thermal Performance Ratio (TPR) by manipulating only ‘Actuator 8’ results in a greater financial loss compared to decreasing the setpoint for ‘PI Controller 2’. This is because ‘Actuator 8’ controls the flow of steam in the desalination plant, which is more critical to the desalination output than ‘PI Controller 2’. As shown in Table 6, all demonstrated process-aware attacks achieve their maximum effect when targeting actuators.

For initiating a water hammer, it is most effective to target a combination of multiple actuators. The input to the desalination plant eventually accumulates in the final flashing chamber. Therefore, temporarily blocking blowdown flows such as reject cooling seawater, blowdown brine flow, and increasing the input seawater rate, results in an increase in brine flow through the desalination plant. This increase can be used to maximize the pressure surge.

| **Type** | **Methodology** | **Impact** |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Controller Attack** | Modify parameters of ‘PI Controller 1’ | Decrease in TPR |
| **Controller Attack** | Increase setpoint of ‘PI Controller 2’ | Increase in Specific Feed Flow Rate (SFF) |
| **Sensor Attack** | Inject false data into ‘Sensor 9’ | Increase in Specific Cooling Water Rate (SCW) |
| **Actuator Attack** | Increase feed seawater flow at actuator 3 and decrease recycle brine flow at actuator 4 | Increase in SFF |
| **Actuator Attack** | Increase reject flow rate at actuator 2 | Increase in SCW |
| **Actuator Attack** | Close blowdown valve (actuator 8) | Increase in Salinity Ratio |
| **Mechanical Failure Attack** | Water Hammer | Mechanical Damage |

#### 7.2 Remaining within Operational Limits
To maximize financial impact on the desalination plant, the adversary must remain within operational limits to avoid suspicion. One reason for the full automation of desalination plants in recent years is to increase the operation time in a steady state. Unforeseen circumstances, such as variations in seawater temperature or sudden decreases in steam in the brine heater, affect the distillate flow rate. These are considered normal, and the control system adjusts to the new parameters.

For the adversary to remain undetected during an attack, the distillate product flow rate should always be kept close to the operational limits. For instance, the optimal product flow rate in the simulation is 19.3 ton/min, with the range of distillate flow varying between 15 to 28 ton/min [11]. To remain undetected, an attack should maintain all measured variables within noise limits and avoid long stretches of undesirable plant states.

Another critical aspect is the adversary's footprint in the control process. Depending on the specific configuration, sensor values and actuator commands may be replicated and logged. Modifications to the P and I parameters of controllers would require inspection of the internal logic of the control parameters. While these modifications still allow the controller to reach its setpoint, they do so in a non-optimal way.

One major assumption in process-aware attacks is the adversary's prior knowledge of the control process and its implementation mechanisms. In our work, the adversary has prior knowledge of the sensors, actuators, and controllers in the MSF desalination plant. Although this type of attack can effectively compromise a plant, it is difficult to generalize to other plants due to its process-specific nature. Traditional IT attacks, on the other hand, are more consistent across different targets, as communication protocols, ports, and computing components and their vulnerabilities often remain the same.

### 8. Conclusion
Industrial control system security has been extensively explored in the literature, focusing mainly on power grids, water treatment plants, and chemical processes. In this interdisciplinary work, we have investigated potential cyber-attacks in both economic terms (inducing financial loss) and mechanical aspects (damaging equipment). Performance attacks were studied using a Matlab desalination plant model, while mechanical attacks were analyzed using an ANSYS model. Results show that the adversary has a variety of options for inducing attacks that maximize impact while remaining within operational limits. Furthermore, the mechanical engineering study demonstrates the danger of equipment damage from cyberspace. This work aims to motivate the need for cybersecurity research for desalination plants and serve as a platform for developing mitigations against process-aware attacks.
