6 presents various attack vectors to achieve the corresponding
effects.
7.1 Maximizing Impact
It is evident that the adversary has numerous entry points for
performing various attacks, but not all the entry points will be
equally effective for maximizing impact. For instance, according to
our experiments, decreasing TPR by using only ‘Actuator 8’ incurs
more financial loss when compared to decreasing the setpoint for ‘PI
Controller 2’. This is because ‘Actuator 8’ controls the flow of steam
in the desalination plant which is more critical for the desalination
output when compared to ‘PI Controller 2’. As observed in Table 6,
all demonstrated process-aware attacks maximize their effect when
the actuators are attacked.
For initiating water hammer, it is most effective to target a com-
bination of various actuators. This is because the input to the de-
salination plant finally accrues in the last flashing chamber. So,
temporarily blocking blowdown flows such as reject cooling sea
water, blowdown brine flow and increasing the input seawater rate,
results in the increase of brine flowing through the desalination
plant. This increase can be used for maximizing the increase in
pressure surge.

7.2 Remaining within Operational Limits
For maximizing financial impact to the desalination plant, the ad-
versary needs to remain within plant operation limits for avoiding
suspicion. One of the reasons for fully automating of desalination
plants in recent years is to increase the operation time of the plants
in their steady state. Frequently, unforeseen circumstances such
as variation in the seawater temperature from the expected value,
or sudden decrease in the amount of steam in brine heater, affect
the output distillate flow rate. This is considered normal and the
control system of the plant will adjust to the new parameters.
Therefore, for the adversary to remain undetected during an
attack, the distillate product flow rate should always be kept close
to the operation limits. For instance, the optimum product flow rate
in the simulation is 19.3 ton/min, while the range of distillate flow
varies between 15 to 28 ton/min as shown in [11]. So, to remain
undetected, an attack should maintain all measured variables within
the noise limits, and avoid long stretches of undesirable plant states.
Another major part of is the footprint of the adversary in the
control process. Depending on the specific configuration, sensor
values and actuator commands may be replicated and logged. On
the other hand, modifications of the P and I parameters of the
controllers would require inspection of the internal logic of the
control parameters. Modifying these parameters still allows the
controller to reach its setpoint, but not in an optimal way.

adversary’s prior knowledge about the control process and its im-
plementation mechanisms. For instance, in our work, the adversary
has prior knowledge about the sensors, actuators, and controllers in
the MSF desalination plant. While this type of attack can effectively
compromise a plant, it is hard to generalize to other plants, since
it is process-specific. Traditional IT attacks, on the other hand, do
not vary much between targets as the communication protocols,
ports, computing components and their vulnerabilities might still
remain consistent.
8 CONCLUSION
Industrial control systems security has been explored extensively
in the literature, mainly focusing on the power grid, water treat-
ment plants, and chemical processes. In this interdisciplinary work,
we have explored potential cyber attacks both in economic terms
(inducing financial loss) and mechanical aspects (destroying equip-
ment). Performance attacks have been investigates on a Matlab
desalination plant model, while mechanical attacks on an ANSYS
model we developed. Results show that the adversary has a vari-
ety of options for inducing attacks that maximize impact while
remaining within operational limits. Furthermore, the mechanical
engineering study also demonstrates that there is the danger of
equipment damage from the cyberspace. This work aims to mo-
tivate the need for cybersecurity research for desalination plants
and serve as a platform for development of mitigations against
process-aware attacks.
