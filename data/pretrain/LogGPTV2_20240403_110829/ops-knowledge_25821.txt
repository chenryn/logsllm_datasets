User: Usually I use shell command time. My purpose is to test if data is small, medium, large or very large set, how much time and memory usage will be.
Any tools for Linux or just Python to do this?
Assistant: I usually do a quick time ./script.py to see how long it takes. That does not show you the memory though, at least not as a default. You can use /usr/bin/time -v ./script.py to get a lot of information, including memory usage.
