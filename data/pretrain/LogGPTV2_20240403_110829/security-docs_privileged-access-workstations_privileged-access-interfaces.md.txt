# Securing Privileged Access: Interfaces

A crucial aspect of [securing privileged access](overview.md) involves applying zero trust policies to ensure that devices, accounts, and intermediaries meet security requirements before gaining access. This policy ensures that both users and devices initiating the inbound session are known, trusted, and authorized to access the resource via the interface. The enforcement of these policies is managed by the Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy engine, which evaluates the policies assigned to specific application interfaces such as the Azure portal, Salesforce, Office 365, AWS, Workday, and others.

This guidance outlines three security levels for interface security, which can be applied to assets with varying sensitivity levels. These levels are configured in the [Securing Privileged Access Rapid Modernization Plan (RAMP)](security-rapid-modernization-plan.md) and correspond to the [security levels of accounts and devices](privileged-access-security-levels.md).

The security requirements for inbound sessions to interfaces apply to both accounts and the source device, whether it's a direct connection from [physical devices](privileged-access-devices.md) or an intermediary such as a Remote Desktop or Jump server. Intermediaries can accept sessions from personal devices to provide enterprise-level security for certain scenarios. However, specialized or privileged intermediaries should not allow connections from lower security levels due to the sensitive nature of their roles.

> [!NOTE]
> While these technologies provide robust end-to-end access control to the application interface, the resource itself must also be protected against out-of-band attacks on the application code, unpatched vulnerabilities, configuration errors, data at rest or in transit, supply chain risks, and other threats. Ensure you assess and mitigate risks to the assets themselves for complete protection. Microsoft provides tools and guidance, including [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/security-center/security-center-introduction), [Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score), and [threat modeling guidance](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl/threatmodeling).

## Interface Examples

Interfaces come in various forms, typically including:

- Cloud service/application websites such as the Azure portal, AWS, and Office 365
- Desktop consoles managing on-premises applications (e.g., Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or custom applications)
- Scripting/console interfaces such as Secure Shell (SSH) or PowerShell

While some of these interfaces directly support Zero Trust enforcement via the Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy engine, others may need to be published through an intermediary such as the Microsoft Entra Application Proxy or a Remote Desktop/Jump server.

## Interface Security

The primary goal of interface security is to ensure that each inbound session to the interface is known, trusted, and allowed:

- **Known**: The user is authenticated with strong authentication, and the device is authenticated (with exceptions for personal devices using a Remote Desktop or VDI solution for enterprise access).
- **Trusted**: Security health is explicitly validated and enforced for [accounts](privileged-access-accounts.md) and [devices](privileged-access-devices.md) using a Zero Trust policy engine.
- **Allowed**: Access to the resources follows the least privilege principle, ensuring it can only be accessed:
  - By the right users
  - At the right time (just-in-time access, not permanent access)
  - With the right approval workflow (as needed)
  - At an acceptable risk/trust level

## Interface Security Controls

Establishing interface security assurances requires a combination of security controls, including:

- **Zero Trust Policy Enforcement**: Using Conditional Access to ensure that inbound sessions meet the following requirements:
  - **Device Trust** to ensure the device:
    - Is managed by the enterprise
    - Has endpoint detection and response
    - Is [compliant with organizational configuration requirements](/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)
    - Is not infected or under attack during the session
  - **User Trust** based on signals such as:
    - Multi-factor authentication usage during initial logon (or added later to increase trust)
    - Whether the session matches historical behavior patterns
    - Whether the account or current session triggers any alerts based on threat intelligence
    - [Microsoft Entra ID Protection risk](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection#risk-detection-and-remediation)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A model that combines enterprise directory groups/permissions and application-specific roles, groups, and permissions.
- **Just-in-Time Access Workflows**: Ensuring specific requirements for privileges (peer approvals, audit trails, privilege expiration, etc.) are enforced before allowing the account to access the privileges it is eligible for.

## Interface Security Levels

This guidance defines three levels of security. For more information on these levels, see "Keep It Simple - Personas and Profiles." For implementation guidance, refer to the [rapid modernization plan](security-rapid-modernization-plan.md).

### Enterprise Interface

Enterprise interface security is suitable for all enterprise users and productivity scenarios. It also serves as a starting point for higher-sensitivity workloads, which can be incrementally built upon to reach specialized and privileged access levels of assurance.

- **Zero Trust Policy Enforcement**: On inbound sessions using Conditional Access to ensure that users and devices are secured at the enterprise or higher level.
  - To support bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios, personal devices, and partner-managed devices may be allowed to connect if they use an enterprise intermediary such as a dedicated [Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD)](/azure/virtual-desktop/security-guide) or similar Remote Desktop/Jump server solution.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The model should ensure that the application is administered only by roles at the specialized or privileged security level.

### Specialized Interface

Security controls for specialized interfaces should include:

- **Zero Trust Policy Enforcement**: On inbound sessions using Conditional Access to ensure that users and devices are secured at the specialized or privileged level.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The model should ensure that the application is administered only by roles at the specialized or privileged security level.
- **Just-in-Time Access Workflows (Optional)**: Enforce least privilege by ensuring privileges are used only by authorized users during the time they are needed.

### Privileged Interface

Security controls for privileged interfaces should include:

- **Zero Trust Policy Enforcement**: On inbound sessions using Conditional Access to ensure that users and devices are secured at the privileged level.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The model should ensure that the application is administered only by roles at the privileged security level.
- **Just-in-Time Access Workflows (Required)**: Enforce least privilege by ensuring privileges are used only by authorized users during the time they are needed.
