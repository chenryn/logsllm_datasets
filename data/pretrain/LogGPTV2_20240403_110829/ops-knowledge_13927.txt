User: How to realize the remote connection and control of the graphical interface in the Linux system?
Assistant: To achieve remote connection and control the graphical interface in the Linux system, there are the following two methods: 1. Use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): In the Linux system, you can use the RDP protocol to remotely connect and control the graphical interface. To do this, you need to install desktop remote desktop protocol service software, such as XRDP. Once XRDP is installed and configured, users can use Windows Remote Desktop to connect to the Linux system and access the Linux system through a graphical interface. XRDP is compatible with multiple desktop environments such as XFCE, MATE and GNOME. 2. Use the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) protocol: The VNC protocol is a remote desktop protocol that allows users to access and control the desktop of a remote computer through the network. In the Linux system, VNC server software, such as TightVNC, needs to be installed. Users need to configure the VNC server so that it can accept connections from VNC clients and send the graphical interface to the clients. Users can use any VNC client to connect to the Linux system, including VNC Viewer and RealVNC. In general, whether you use RDP or VNC, you need to configure remote access in the Linux system, and ensure that related services and firewalls allow access and connections to external IPs.
