Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple attempts to connect to the LabSZ software component. Two attempts from 119.4.203.64 and 52.80.34.196 resulted in too many authentication failures for admin and invalid user matlab, respectively. Another attempt from 183.136.162.51 resulted in an invalid user inspur. Finally, there were three attempts from 1.237.174.253, 88.147.143.242, and 183.62.140.253 that resulted in connection closed by and invalid user zhangyan, respectively.
