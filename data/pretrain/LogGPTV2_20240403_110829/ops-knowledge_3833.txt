User: My apologies if this has already been asked and answered.  I don't know enough about eclipse & pydev setup to know what to search for.
I'd like to use pydev, but can't modify the existing installation of eclipse.  Do I need to install my own eclipse so that I can then install pydev into it, or is there a way to install pydev off to the side such that I can then use it with the existing eclipse?
Assistant: Something that worked quite nicely for me when I was using Pydev with Eclipse as a non-privileged user on a shared computer was to install Eclipse+Pydev on a flash drive. You have the added advantage of being able to work from any computer while having your usual settings.
