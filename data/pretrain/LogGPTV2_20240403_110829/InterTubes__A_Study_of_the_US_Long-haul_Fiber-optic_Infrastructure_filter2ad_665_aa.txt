## Abstract
The high complexity and significant costs associated with installing new long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure have led to substantial sharing of previously installed conduits. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics and implications of such infrastructure sharing by examining the long-haul fiber-optic network in the United States.

We begin by constructing a map of the long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure using fiber maps provided by tier-1 ISPs and major cable providers. We enhance the accuracy of our map by incorporating underutilized data sources, such as public records from federal, state, and municipal agencies. We then quantify the connectivity characteristics of the resulting map and confirm a strong correspondence between long-haul fiber-optic, roadway, and railway infrastructures.

Next, we investigate the prevalence of high-risk links by mapping end-to-end paths from large-scale traceroute campaigns onto our fiber-optic infrastructure map. We demonstrate that both risk and latency (i.e., propagation delay) can be reduced by deploying new links along previously unused transportation corridors and rights-of-way. Focusing on a subset of high-risk links is sufficient to improve the overall robustness of the network against failures. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings on issues related to performance, net neutrality, and policy decision-making.

## 1. Introduction
Recent research efforts in networking have been driven by the challenges posed by novel designs, technologies, and applications such as data centers, cloud services, software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), mobile communication, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The excitement surrounding these new architectural designs, services, and applications is understandable from both a research and industry perspective. However, it is often assumed that the physical infrastructure of tomorrow's Internet will have the necessary capacity, performance, and resilience to support increasingly bandwidth-hungry, delay-intolerant, or QoS-sensitive services and applications.

Despite two decades of research focused on understanding aspects of the Internet's infrastructure, such as its router-level topology or the graph structure of interconnected Autonomous Systems (ASes), little is known about the physical components of today's Internet, including cell towers, routers, switches, and fiber-optic cables. This lack of understanding is exemplified by the metaphor used in 2006 by the late U.S. Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who referred to the Internet as "a series of tubes." 

This paper focuses on the physical aspects of the wired Internet, specifically the long-haul fiber-optic portion in the United States. We ignore the wireless access portion of the Internet, satellite communications, and other forms of wireless communication. Unlike short-haul fiber routes, which are built for specific, short-distance purposes, long-haul fiber routes typically run between major city pairs and allow for minimal use of repeaters.

Our primary contribution is the construction of a reproducible map of the US long-haul fiber-optic network. We use publicly available fiber maps from tier-1 ISPs and major cable providers, supplemented by underutilized data sources such as public records from federal, state, and municipal agencies. We study the connectivity characteristics of the resulting map and quantify the consistency of long-haul fiber-optic connectivity with existing transportation infrastructure (e.g., roadways and railways).

A notable characteristic of the constructed US long-haul fiber-optic network is the significant amount of observed infrastructure sharing. We assess the risks associated with this sharing, which is a common practice among service providers to achieve substantial cost savings. By considering different metrics for measuring the risks, we identify high-risk links in the existing long-haul infrastructure from both a connectivity and usage perspective. We use the popularity of a route as a proxy for the volume of traffic it carries and overlay end-to-end paths derived from large-scale traceroute campaigns onto the actual long-haul fiber-optic routes.

Finally, we analyze how to improve the existing long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure to increase its resilience to failures and reduce propagation delays. We show that both robustness and performance can be enhanced by deploying new fiber routes in strategically chosen areas along previously unused transportation corridors and rights-of-way. These technical solutions often conflict with current legislation favoring policies such as "dig once," "joint trenching," or "shadow conduits" due to the substantial cost savings they offer. We discuss our findings in the context of the net neutrality debate and argue for a quantitative assessment of the trade-offs between cost savings and infrastructure resilience.

## 2. Mapping Core Long-haul Infrastructure
In this section, we describe the process of constructing a map of the long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure in the continental United States. While many dynamic aspects of the Internet's topology have been studied, the underlying long-haul fiber paths are static, and it is this fixed infrastructure that we aim to identify.

### 2.1 Step 1: Build an Initial Map
The first step in our fiber map-building process is to leverage maps of ISP fiber infrastructure with explicit geocoding of links from the Internet Atlas project [83]. We start with detailed fiber deployment maps from 5 tier-1 and 4 major cable providers: AT&T, Comcast, Cogent, EarthLink, Integra, Level3, Suddenlink, Verizon, and Zayo. These ISPs contributed 267 unique nodes, 1258 links, and a total of 512 conduits to the map.

### 2.2 Step 2: Validate the Initial Map
While the link location data gathered in the first step are generally reliable, we validate these data using additional information sources. We also use these sources to infer whether some links follow the same physical right-of-way (ROW), indicating that the fiber links either reside in the same fiber bundle or in adjacent conduits. We use a variety of public records, including government agency filings, environmental impact statements, documentation from third-party fiber services, indefeasible rights of use (IRU) agreements, press releases, and other related resources.

### 2.3 Step 3: Augment the Map
The third step is to use published maps of tier-1 and large regional ISPs that do not contain explicit geocoded information. We tentatively add the fiber links from these ISPs to the map by aligning the logical links indicated in their published maps along the closest known right-of-way (e.g., road or rail). We validate and correct these tentative placements in the next step.

By following these steps, we construct a comprehensive and accurate map of the US long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure, providing a valuable resource for further research and policy-making.
