User: I have been using python dns module.I was trying to use it on a new Linux installation but the module is not getting loaded.
I have tried to clean up and install but the installation does not seem to be working.


    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.3
    $ sudo pip install dnspython

Thanks a lot for your help.
Note:- I have firewall installed on the new machine. I am not sure if it should effect the import. but i have tried disabling it and still it does not seem to work.
Assistant: If you don't have (or don't want) pip installed there is another way. You can to solve this is to install package with native OS package manager.
For example for Debian-based systems this would be command:
apt install python3-dnspython
