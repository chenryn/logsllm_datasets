I understand that you are experiencing issues with the `dnspython` module on a new Linux installation. Despite successfully installing the package, you are unable to import it in Python. Here is a more detailed and professional version of your problem and the steps you have taken:

**Issue Description:**

I am currently using the `dnspython` module in my Python scripts. However, after setting up a new Linux environment, I encountered an issue where the `dnspython` module cannot be loaded.

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Python and pip Version Check:**
   - Verified the Python version:
     ```sh
     $ python --version
     Python 2.7.3
     ```
   - Verified the pip version:
     ```sh
     $ pip --version
     pip 1.0 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
     ```

2. **Installation of `dnspython`:**
   - Attempted to install the `dnspython` module using pip:
     ```sh
     $ sudo pip install dnspython
     Downloading/unpacking dnspython
       Downloading dnspython-1.11.1.zip (220Kb): 220Kb downloaded
       Running setup.py egg_info for package dnspython

     Installing collected packages: dnspython
       Running setup.py install for dnspython

     Successfully installed dnspython
     Cleaning up...
     ```

3. **Verification of Installation:**
   - Attempted to import the `dns` module in Python:
     ```sh
     $ python
     Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
     [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
     >>> import dns
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     ImportError: No module named dns
     ```

4. **Additional Checks:**
   - Confirmed the location of the Python executable:
     ```sh
     $ which python
     /usr/bin/python
     ```
   - Noted that a firewall is installed on the new machine, but disabling it did not resolve the issue.

**Possible Solution:**

If you do not have or prefer not to use `pip`, you can install the `dnspython` package using the native package manager of your operating system. For Debian-based systems, you can use the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-dnspython
```

For other distributions, you can find the appropriate package name and installation method in the respective package repositories.

Thank you for your assistance.
