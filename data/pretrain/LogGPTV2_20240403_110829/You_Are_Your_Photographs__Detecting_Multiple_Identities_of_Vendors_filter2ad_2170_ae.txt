### Adversarial Countermoves

The method under discussion is not designed for adversarial settings. If a vendor wishes to prevent their multiple accounts from being linked, there are potential countermoves they can employ. Before delving into these adversarial strategies, it is important to note that vendors generally have no real motivation to hide their multiple accounts across different markets. The only scenario where vendors might be motivated to conceal their Sybil identities is when they create multiple accounts within the same market. Intra-market Sybils are prohibited by market administrators, who actively seek to detect and remove such accounts.

To evaluate the impact of potential adversarial countermoves, we consider several image transformations. Specifically, to avoid detection, a vendor may slightly alter the photos (to obscure personal styles) before posting them through a Sybil account. We examine three simple transformations: blurring the image, reducing contrast, and adding random noise. For simplicity, we apply Gaussian smoothing with \(\sigma = 2\) for image blurring, adjust the image contrast to 50% of the original, and add noise by randomly selecting 5% of the pixels and changing them to black or white. Figure 10 illustrates an example of these transformations.

We conducted a preliminary test on the impact of these adversarial countermoves using the Agora dataset with \(T_r = 20\). We followed the same ground-truth evaluation workflow as described in ยง4.2, but applied the image transformations to the testing images. The results are summarized in Table 7. We observe that blurring and contrast adjustment only slightly decrease the matching accuracy. However, adding random noise significantly reduces the accuracy. Even with just 5% noise pixels, the products in the images remain clearly recognizable.

Beyond adding random noise, vendors can also apply more sophisticated adversarial noises optimized against DNN-based classifiers [8, 18, 31, 37, 41, 50, 53]. Conversely, defenders (market administrators) can adopt defense techniques to "de-noise" the images and reduce the adversarial effect [3, 19, 36, 59] or enhance the robustness of the image classifier [18, 31, 44, 62]. Another defensive strategy is to set a smaller similarity threshold to include more candidate pairs for further investigation.

In addition to adversarial image transformations, vendors can sell different products using different accounts or change their photo style. This type of adversarial behavior is primarily relevant to intra-market Sybils, not the majority of inter-market Sybil accounts. Future work will measure the adversarial adaptations of vendors in the wild.

### Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, our analysis covers only three darknet markets, and many other markets exist [5]. Future work will explore applying our tool to a broader range of recent darknet markets. Second, although there is no evidence suggesting that Sybil vendors are attempting to avoid detection by altering their photos, further research into adversarial machine learning is necessary to improve the robustness of our analysis. Third, during manual inspection, we identified additional features (e.g., username, image trademarks, shipping information) that could be integrated to build a more powerful analysis tool.

### Related Work

Researchers have extensively studied darknet markets [11, 48] and underground forums [2, 23, 35] from various perspectives. Some researchers use underground forums to study specific cybercriminal activities, such as pharmaceutical affiliate programs [35], large spam operations [49], trading stolen credit cards [20], and search engine optimization services [14]. Others focus on the products sold on black markets [23], develop automated tools to identify forum posts related to transactions [42], and analyze the network footprints of underground vendors [51]. Recent studies have also examined the "social networks" and communities among cybercriminals [15, 38, 60]. In this paper, we present a novel system to link Sybil identities through image analysis, supporting more efficient investigations of cybercrimes.

### Stylometry Analysis

Stylometry analysis has been a useful tool for attributing authorship of anonymous online posts [13, 42]. The most relevant work to ours involves using stylometry analysis to link Sybil accounts in underground forums [1, 6, 17, 22]. However, we found that stylometry analysis is less effective for modeling darknet market vendors due to the short and repetitive nature of the text. In comparison, our image-based approach achieved more promising results.

### Image Analysis Using Deep Neural Networks

Deep neural networks have driven significant advancements in computer vision in recent years. Deep learning algorithms [30, 45] now achieve human-level accuracy in recognizing objects from images. These algorithms can leverage massive training data to build highly accurate models. For many deep learning applications, transfer learning can be used when the application-specific training dataset is insufficiently large [40, 46, 54].

A related body of work focuses on photographer identification based on photos [9, 10, 26, 34, 43, 55, 56] or egocentric videos [24]. However, recent results show that lower-level features are less effective than high-level features in photograph authorship attribution tasks [56]. Existing high-level feature-based methods focus on well-known photographers with strong personal styles [56]. In contrast, our model targets a much larger population of darknet vendors, who are typically not professional photographers.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of fingerprinting darknet vendors through their posted photographs. By evaluating the proposed system on real-world datasets, we show its advantage over existing stylometry methods in terms of both accuracy and coverage of fingerprintable vendors. Additionally, we use the system to detect previously unknown Sybil account pairs, both within the same markets and across different markets. Future work will continue to monitor darknet markets and measure potential adversarial evasions from vendors.
