Most inter-frame sequence number gaps are 1. However, a non-negligible percentage of
them are greater than 1. This could be due to lost frames, retransmitted frames, etc.

(a) Sequence number gap of an AP
(b) The distribution of sequence number
gaps in Figure (a)
Fig. 2. Pattern of inter-frame sequence number gaps for frames coming from an AP.
Because the monitor node is close to the AP, fewer frames are lost or retransmitted than
in the STA case. However, some inter-frame gaps are smaller than 0, which suggests
that the AP can transmit frames out of order.
if S0 is 2 and S1 is 1, the gap between them will be 4095. We treat all G values
that are greater than or equal to 4093 as indications of out of order frames. They
are subsequently converted to a negative value for convenience.
Figure 1 and 2 show the pattern of inter-frame sequence number gap for
frames coming from a STA and an AP, respectively. The sequence number gap
is computed on a monitor node that is located close to the AP. The monitor
node has one WLAN NIC working in the RF monitor mode and thus can receive
all frames that the AP sends and receives. One STA is placed on the edge of the
listening range of the AP so as to stress the monitor node’s ability to receive the
STA’s frames.

For Figure 1, about 30K frames from the STA are captured and analyzed.
In Figure 1(a), the inter-frame sequence number gap G is shown over time, and
varies between 0 and 30. Most inter-frame sequence number gaps are 0, 1, or 2.
The detailed distribution of G is in Figure 1(b). 88.8% of inter-frame gaps are 1,
3.3% of inter-frame sequence number gaps are 0 due to duplicate frames, around
5.3% inter-frame sequence number gaps are 2, and 2.6% inter-frame sequence
number gaps are greater than 2. When inter-frame sequence number gaps are
greater than 1, it means for some reasons the monitor node fails to capture
intermediate frames.
For Figure 2, around 63K frames from the AP are captured and analyzed.
In contrast to the STA case, inter-frame sequence number gaps can be -1 or
even -2. This means some frames from the AP are transmitted out of order. A
detailed examination shows that whenever inter-frame sequence number gaps
are -1, the ﬁrst frame is always a beacon frame. We conjecture that the AP
tends to prioritize the transmission of beacon frames over normal data frames
to satisfy the beacon broadcasting frequency requirement. We also found one
case in which the gap is -2. This arises because the AP sends a beacon frame
and a probe response frame before a data frame that logically precedes them.
Another major diﬀerence from the STA case is that the maximum inter-frame
sequence number gap for the AP case is only 3. This means fewer frames are
lost, presumably because the monitor node is placed close to the AP so it can
reliably capture all the frames from the AP.
To summarize, the inter-frame sequence number gaps for frames sent by a
STA and an AP when observed from a monitor node close to the AP show the
following patterns:
– The monitor node can receive duplicate frames from both the STA and AP.
– The monitor node may not receive all the frames from the STA or AP. The
further apart the frame source from the monitor node is, the more frames
are likely to be lost.
– While the STA always transmits in order, the AP may transmit time-
sensitive beacon/probe response frames out of order before normal data
frames.
4.3 Spoof Detection Algorithm
In theory, the inter-frame sequence number gap should always be one; so when-
ever the inter-frame sequence number gap for frames from a wireless node is not
one, there is a spooﬁng activity. In practice, however, the inter-frame sequence
number gap may be diﬀerent from one, because frames are lost, retransmitted,
or out of order, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. Simply raising an alert for spooﬁng
whenever the inter-frame sequence number gap is diﬀerent from 1 may generate
too many false positives.
The pseudocode of the proposed spoof detection algorithm is shown in
Figure 3. The monitor node constantly keeps track of the sequence number
associated with frames coming from the AP and each of the STAs. When a

respectively. The value of G will be between 0 and 4095 inclusively and fall
