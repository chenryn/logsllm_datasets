### Environment
  * Dubbo version: latest
### Step to reproduce this issue
  1. export a rest service DemoService with a url: rest://127.0.0.1:4444/test/
  2. then we will get a real rest service with rest://127.0.0.1:4444/test/DemoService
  3. but when we export a rest service DemoService with a url: rest://127.0.0.1:4444/test
  4. then we will get a real rest service with rest://127.0.0.1:4444/DemoService
Those are the different results, in the second case the context path test is
missing.  
So users use explicit exporter and invoker to call rest services, they would
feel puzzled.
We should fix it by modifying getContextPath method.
