User: I'm fighting with installation SIP for Python on Mac OS X. Finally after compilation and installation when I run console form folder of SIP (locally) I can import sipconfig, but when I`m in other folder I cant - there is no module called sipconfig.
My question is - Where is folder to which I have to copy modules if I want to have them available globally (like "import os"), or how I can check it, because location "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/" doesn`t work.
Assistant: For Python 3.5, It's /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages
