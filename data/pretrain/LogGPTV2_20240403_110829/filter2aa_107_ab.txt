Experiment Results

1.
AIaaS based pipeline reduced time required for phishing content curation and 
context analysis.
For optimisation purposes, a trained operator is still required to ensure AI generated content 
remains relevant.
2.
AI generated phishing content is observed to be more convincing during our 
experiment runs as compared to the human generated phishing content.
However, we cannot conclude if AI is indeed better as there are many other variables at work.
3.
There is a varying degree of governance regarding the access to AIaaS.
OpenAI was strict over the sign up, while other services simply need an email.

“We expect that content-based 
detection of synthetic text is a 
long-term challenge… this is not high 
enough accuracy for standalone 
detection and needs to be paired 
with metadata-based approaches, 
human judgment, and public 
education to be more effective.”

AI-assisted human detection 
using three tests:
●
The probability of the 
word given the previous 
words in the sequence.
●
The absolute rank of a 
word.
●
The entropy of the 
predicted distribution.

Using GLTR Metrics To Distinguish Synthetic Text
Human-generated samples used words outside of the top 100 
predictions:
●
7.23 times as frequently as the GPT-3 API generated 
samples
●
4.57 times as frequently as the GPT-2 generated samples
●
2.88 times as frequently as the ﬁne-tuned GPT-2 generated 
samples

Using GLTR Metrics To Distinguish Synthetic Text
AI: Greater density at low 
rank/low probability
Human: Greater density at high 
rank/low probability
Our research suggests that evaluating the probability for a sequence of text is a good 
indicator of whether the text is synthetic or written by human.

Conclusion

Our Parting Words
Copyright © Government Technology Agency. Not to be reproduced without permission.
1.
The rapid growth of AIaaS has placed advanced, cost-effective AI text 
generation capabilities in the hands of the global market. 
These capabilities can be used to deliver both authorised and malicious phishing campaigns.
2.
While automated tools can be used  to build defenses against AI-generated 
text, current approaches are brittle and model-dependent. 
AI-assisted human detection of AI-generated text could be more effective.
3.
Decision makers have the responsibility to implement sound strategies 
governing the supply and consumption of advanced AIaaS.
Tightening the usage of advanced AIaaS can potentially reduce the likelihood of abuse.
