# Phishing Experiment Overview

## Introduction
In our experiments, we will compare the effectiveness of phishing content generated by AI with that manually created by a red team operator. The goal is to understand how these different methods influence the success rates of phishing attempts.

### Type 1 Experiment Setup
| Sample Size | Exercise | Stage | AI | Human |
|-------------|----------|-------|----|-------|
| A           | 1        | 25    | 25 | -     |
| A           | 2        | 5     | -  | -     |
| B           | 1        | 117   | 117| -     |
| B           | 2        | 10    | -  | -     |
| C           | 1        | 10    | 10 | -     |
| C           | 2        | 2     | -  | -     |

#### Stage 1: Mass Phishing
- **Objective:** Identify targets who are susceptible to phishing.
- **Metrics:**
  - Number of targets (susceptible victims) who clicked on the phishing link (%)
  - Number of susceptible victims who visited the phishing site only (%)
  - Number of susceptible victims who visited the phishing site and submitted data (%)

#### Stage 2: Spear Phishing
- **Objective:** Attempt to harvest credentials from the susceptible victims.

### Type 2 Experiment Setup and Results
| Sample Size | Exercise | Stage | AI | Human |
|-------------|----------|-------|----|-------|

#### Stage 1: Mass Phishing
- **Objective:** Identify targets who are susceptible to phishing.
- **Metrics:**
  - Number of targets (susceptible victims) who opened the malicious attachment (%)

## Key Observations From the Experiments
1. **AIaaS-based Pipeline:**
   - Reduced the time required for phishing content curation and context analysis.
   - A trained operator is still required to ensure the AI-generated content remains relevant.

2. **Effectiveness of AI-Generated Content:**
   - AI-generated phishing content was observed to be more convincing during our experiment runs compared to human-generated content.
   - However, we cannot conclusively state that AI is better, as there are many other variables at play.

3. **Governance and Access:**
   - There is a varying degree of governance regarding access to AIaaS.
   - OpenAI, for example, has strict sign-up requirements, while other services may only require an email address.

## Defenses Against the Dark Arts
### Detecting Synthetic Text
- **Synthetic text detection:**
  - Fine-tuning based detection
  - Zero-shot detection
  - GLTR
  - GROVER
  - Simple classifiers

**Quote:**
> “We expect that content-based detection of synthetic text is a long-term challenge… this is not high enough accuracy for standalone detection and needs to be paired with metadata-based approaches, human judgment, and public education to be more effective.”
> — Irene Solaiman, Jack Clark, and Miles Brundage, “GPT-2: 1.5B Release,” 2019

### AI-assisted Human Detection Using Three Tests:
1. **Probability of the word given the previous words in the sequence.**
2. **Absolute rank of a word.**
3. **Entropy of the predicted distribution.**
— Sebastian Gehrmann, Hendrik Strobelt, and Alexander M. Rush, “GLTR: Statistical Detection and Visualization of Generated Text,” 2019

### Using GLTR Approach to Detect
- **Challenges:**
  - Cannot control top K
  - No direct model access
  - Limited number of logprobs (100)
- **Benefits:**
  - Easily extensible
  - Transferrable patterns from GPT-2
  - Access to logprobs

### Using GLTR Metrics to Distinguish Synthetic Text
- **Human-generated samples:**
  - Used words outside of the top 100 predictions:
    - 7.23 times as frequently as the GPT-3 API generated samples
    - 4.57 times as frequently as the GPT-2 generated samples
    - 2.88 times as frequently as the fine-tuned GPT-2 generated samples

- **AI vs. Human:**
  - AI: Greater density at low rank/low probability
  - Human: Greater density at high rank/low probability

### Using OpenAI’s GPT-3 to Detect Synthetic Text
- **Sample A:**
  - [Insert text here]
  - `frac(p): 0.833`
- **Sample B:**
  - [Insert text here]
  - `frac(p): 0.884`
- **Sample C:**
  - [Insert text here]
  - `frac(p): 0.554`

## Fighting Abuses with Governance
- **Adopt “human in the loop” approach for AI-augmented decision-making.**
- **Ensure traceability and auditability of use.**
- **Enforce acceptable use policies.**

### Recommendations for Everyone:
- **Use Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organizations.**
- **Policy for explanation and practice general disclosure of use.**
- **Ethical evaluation.**
- **Implement clear roles and responsibilities for the ethical deployment of AI.**

### Key Applicable Recommendations from Singapore’s Model AI Governance Framework

## Conclusion
### Key Takeaways
1. **Rapid Growth of AIaaS:**
   - Advanced, cost-effective AI text generation capabilities are now available globally.
   - These can be used for both authorized and malicious phishing campaigns.

2. **Defenses Against AI-Generated Text:**
   - Automated tools can build defenses, but current approaches are brittle and model-dependent.
   - AI-assisted human detection of AI-generated text could be more effective.

3. **Governance and Responsibility:**
   - Decision-makers must implement sound strategies for the supply and consumption of advanced AIaaS.
   - Tightening the usage of advanced AIaaS can potentially reduce the likelihood of abuse.
