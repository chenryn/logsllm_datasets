•  Sun Wu (Tzu) “Ping-fa”(The Art of War) 
•  All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to 
attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we 
must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make 
the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we 
must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to 
entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.

The History of the 36 Stratagems 
Cooking = France 
Painting = Italy 
Military Strategy = China 
The History of Social Engineering 
From the beginning of time before it had a name it 
was being used as an effective form of attack. 
Amenhotep III 
The first Trojan attack 
Bards masters of the (S.E.) craft 
 How S.E. differs between cultures 
Asia: Save face = Losing secrets 
Europe: Command = Control 
North America: Do unto others = Before they do to you 
South America: Mutual benefit = An uneven outcome 
The new OSI model 
Layer 1-6 is over used time for a new vector. 
Layer 7 good but getting better defended. 
Layer 8 less guarded and can’t be patched ;-) 
Why use Layer 8?

36. "Escape - the best scheme” 
走为上 
Every plan should have an exit strategy in case the attack fails  
(especially if you are doing it in the “real world”).  
Okay now what can we do?
