### Abstract

The rapid growth of the Internet and the continuous adoption of innovative technology have significantly transformed the travel industry over the past decade. In response to the constantly changing business environment, one of the latest concepts in the tourism industry is Dynamic Packaging. This approach allows customers to create customized holiday packages by combining individual travel components online. While Dynamic Packaging has been widely accepted by consumers, the strategic impacts of this technology remain uncertain. This paper presents a study of an extended packaging architecture and introduces a new model called the Knowledge-based Dynamic Packaging Model.

### 1. Introduction

Tourism is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the global economy. The World Tourism Organization predicts a 200% increase in tourist arrivals worldwide by 2020, with each consumer taking an average of four holidays per year [1]. This growth is driven by factors such as increased leisure time, social importance, and global economic expansion.

According to Carl H. Marcussen from the Centre for Regional and Tourism Research of Denmark, the European online travel market size grew from €2.5 billion in 2000 to €18.2 billion in 2004, with further growth to €28.5 billion expected by 2006 [2]. Despite this growth, the e-Tourism market remains opaque due to the difficulty in comparing various distribution channels [5].

The tourism industry's significant changes are linked to the continuous adoption of innovative technology and the increasing number of consumers with the necessary knowledge and resources (hardware, software, and internet access) to benefit from it. As a service sector with a highly complex product, the tourism industry relies on a fragmented supply chain, where each link contributes to the overall product. Unlike the early days of online travel, when suppliers contracted with online agencies, today, suppliers aim to regain control of their inventory and improve direct sales through their own websites. For example, British Airways reports that 42% of their bookings are made directly through BA.com, while Aer Lingus claims a figure closer to 70% [3].

### 2. Defining Dynamic Packaging

Dynamic Packaging is a term used in various contexts, often referring to a technology or an overall merchandising solution [6]. Several definitions exist in the literature, some of which are contradictory or complementary. According to [7], Dynamic Packaging enables consumers or booking agents to build customized itineraries by assembling multiple components and completing the transaction in real-time. Fitzgerald [6] emphasizes the need for an infrastructure to integrate data across multiple heterogeneous systems containing tourism-related information. 

Meyer [9] highlights that a key characteristic of Dynamic Packaging is the ability to combine services described in local inventories or external sources. For us, Dynamic Packaging is based on an individual consumer request, allowing the combination of multiple travel components (e.g., flights, hotels, car rentals) in real-time, providing a single, fully priced package with a single payment and hiding the pricing of individual components.

### 3. Extended Packaging Architecture

The main components of the Extended Packaging Architecture (Figure 1) include the knowledge-based packaging process, influenced by social networks and user profiles. The architecture also incorporates descriptive information from social networks, public websites, and Destination Management Systems, along with optional semantic integration.

#### 3.1. Key Components

- **Knowledge-Based Packaging Process:** This process is influenced by social networks and user profiles, ensuring that the dynamic packages are tailored to individual customer preferences.
- **Descriptive Information Integration:** Information from social networks, public websites, and Destination Management Systems is integrated to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date view of available travel options.
- **Semantic Integration:** As an optional functionality, semantic integration ensures that the data from various sources is meaningfully combined, enhancing the quality and relevance of the dynamic packages.

#### 3.2. Layers of the Architecture

- **Local Database Layer:** Product information is stored in a local database, which includes the company's own inventory and external inventories accessed in real-time or supported by a cache mechanism.
- **External Inventory Layer:** Real-time access to external inventories extends the range of products that can be offered to customers. This layer is crucial for companies that cannot solve interoperability issues between different tourism information systems.
- **Interoperability Layer:** Establishing linkages to diverse numbers of suppliers from various travel industries is essential for providing customized travel products. This layer ensures that up-to-date information is available in real-time within tolerable response times.

### Conclusion

The Knowledge-based Dynamic Packaging Model aims to meet the needs of present and future customers more efficiently. By integrating detailed individual customer information and experiences from a broad mass of travelers, this model extends the concept of Dynamic Packaging to offer more personalized and value-adding informational services. Future research will focus on the implementation and evaluation of this model in real-world scenarios.
