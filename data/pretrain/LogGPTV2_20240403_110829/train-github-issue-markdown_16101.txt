Since many follows a pull-request flow. It would be ideal if a developer could
see a (HEAD+changes)-to-branch diff views and not ont only Changes-to-HEAD
diff view as it is currently.
Many make some changes and makes some commits on a feature or bug branch. They
push the new commits to their fork and review the changes before submitting a
pull request. The review is a diff against, most likely, an upstream master
branch. The problem is, that it is time consuming to make many micro changes
online by force pushing etc. It would be more ideal if this diff view could be
viewed locally in VSCode and not only on Github.
