Question: In the HMAC-DRBG algorithm, when generating pseudorandom bits with additional true random input 's', which of the following statements accurately describe the process and rationale for updating the internal state and generating the output? Select all that apply.
"A": "The internal state 'K' and 'V' is updated after generating the pseudorandom bits to ensure that the next output cannot be predicted if the current state is compromised.",
"B": "True randomness 's' is added to the internal state to refresh 'K' and 'V', ensuring the unpredictability of subsequent pseudorandom outputs even if the initial state was known.",
"C": "The use of different constants (`0x00` and `0x01`) when updating 'K' with true randomness 's' is to maintain a clear distinction between seed and reseed operations.",
"D": "The internal state is never updated after the initial seeding process to maintain the highest level of performance in pseudorandom bit generation."
Answer: AB
