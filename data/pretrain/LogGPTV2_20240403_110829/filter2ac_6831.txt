### Title: Black Hat US-19: I'm Unique, Just Like You: Human Side-Channels and Their Implications for Security and Privacy

Almost every aspect of our physical being—our handwriting, DNA, faces, voices, fingerprints, and even our eyes—can uniquely identify us among the seven billion people on Earth. These physical identifiers are invaluable for law enforcement in tracing real-world crimes to offenders and for enabling biometric authentication. However, they often fall short when it comes to tracking or disrupting threat actors in the digital realm.

In this talk, I will delve into a different set of identifiers: those that are unintentional, non-physical, and generated as a result of human behaviors and activities. These identifiers, which I call "human side-channels," can still be used to uniquely identify and track individual users online. I will explore how these human side-channels work, their potential uses in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity, and strategies to counter them.

Specifically, I will examine three types of human side-channels:
1. **Forensic Linguistics**: The unique patterns in our language use.
2. **Behavioral Signatures**: Consistent patterns in our online behavior.
3. **Cultural References**: The cultural and contextual references we make.

I will begin by discussing the theoretical underpinnings of these side-channels, which are rooted in personality psychology and the concepts of consistency and distinctiveness. These characteristics arise from our unique experiences, training, and feedback.

Next, I will provide an in-depth look at how these side-channels function, supported by case studies and practical examples. I will demonstrate how they can be applied in security contexts, such as investigating hostile social media profiles, post-compromise data exfiltration, and privilege escalation.

Additionally, I will address the privacy implications of each technique. Unlike physical identifiers, these human side-channels are much harder to recognize, obfuscate, or spoof, making them a significant threat to personal privacy. I will discuss possible countermeasures to disguise your own human side-channels and conclude with some ideas for future research in these areas.

By the end of this talk, you will have a comprehensive understanding of human side-channels, their potential impact on security and privacy, and the steps you can take to protect yourself.
