User: Use Python to write a script to periodically clean up useless log files and temporary files on the server.
Assistant: This task is accomplished by running a regular cleanup task on the Linux system, and a simple script can be written in Python for this purpose. The basic steps of the script include: 1. Import necessary modules, such as os and glob 2. Specify the directory and file type to be cleaned up 3. Traverse the specified directory and match the file type to be cleaned up through the glob module 4. If a matching file is found, Just use the os module to delete it. The sample code is as follows: ```python import os import glob PATHS_TO_CLEAN = ['/var/log/', '/tmp/'] FILE_TYPES_TO_CLEAN = ['*.log', '*.tmp' ] for path_to_clean in PATHS_TO_CLEAN: for file_type_to_clean in FILE_TYPES_TO_CLEAN: search_path = os.path.join(path_to_clean, file_type_to_clean) for file_to_delete in glob.glob(search_path): os.remove(file_to_delete) print(f "Deleted file {file_to_delete}") ``` This script iterates through each directory in PATHS_TO_CLEAN and searches each directory for the file types specified in FILE_TYPES_TO_CLEAN. If a matching file is found, it will be deleted, and the information about the deletion operation will be output to the console. You can save the above code as a file named "log_cleanup.py", and use a system timing task tool such as cron to execute the script regularly to automatically clean up expired files.
