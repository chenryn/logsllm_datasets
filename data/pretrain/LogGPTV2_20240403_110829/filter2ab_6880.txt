**ATT&CK ID:** T1608  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Stage Capabilities

Adversaries may upload, install, or otherwise set up capabilities that can be used during their operations. To facilitate their activities, adversaries often need to deploy the tools and techniques they have developed (Develop Capabilities) or acquired (Obtain Capabilities) on infrastructure under their control. This staging process can occur on infrastructure that the adversary has previously purchased or rented (Acquire Infrastructure) or on systems they have compromised (Compromise Infrastructure). Additionally, these capabilities may be staged on web services such as GitHub or Pastebin, or on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings, which allow users to easily deploy and manage applications.
