6 Related Work
X-Vine provides multi-hop social network routing, loga-
rithmic state Sybil defense, protects privacy of friendship
information, and enables pseudonymous communication.
Our work is the ﬁrst to provide these properties. However,
X-Vine builds upon foundational work in several areas:
Sybil defense:
Sybil defenses must fundamentally im-
pose a cost on participation in the network [22]. One ap-
proach, advocated by Castro et al. [16], requires users to
provide identity credentials and/or payment to a centralized
authority, who then issues certiﬁcates allowing users to par-
ticipate. This authority, of course, becomes a central point
of trust. Decentralized approaches instead allow nodes to
directly verify some resource expenditure by other nodes,
such as CPU computation, or the possession of a unique IP
address [12, 55]. All these solutions face a tradeoff between
creating too high a barrier for participation by honest users
and making it too easy for malicious users to create Sybil
identities. More recent work has recognized that it is ex-
pensive for a malicious adversary to establish trust relation-
ships with honest users and thus social network topologies
can be used to detect and mitigate social Sybil attacks. The
design of X-Vine is based upon the same principle.
SybilGuard [69] and SybilLimit [68] are decentralized
systems for Sybil defense. These systems use special ran-
dom walks called random routes for Sybil defense.
In
SybilLimit, as long as the number of attack edges is less
log n(cid:17)), then with high proba-
than a threshold (g = o(cid:16) n
bility, a short random walk of O(log n) steps is likely to
stay within the set of honest nodes. Nodes in SybilLimit
perform √e short random walks (where e is the number of
edges amongst the honest nodes) and keep track of their last
edges (tails). By the birthday paradox, two honest nodes
will share a common tail with high probability. Each node
allows only a certain number of random routes to traverse
it, thereby limiting the number of Sybil identities that are
validated by the honest nodes.
SybilInfer [21] provides an algorithm for labeling nodes
in a social network as honest users or Sybils controlled by
It takes as an input a social graph G, and
an adversary.
generates a set of traces using short random walks. Using
a mathematical model of an honest social network, it per-
forms Bayesian inference to output a set of dishonest nodes.
The Bayesian inference approach can even be used to assign
probabilities to nodes of being honest or dishonest. These
systems are standalone Sybil defenses and do not provide a
DHT functionality.
Whanau [34] is the state of art Sybil resilient DHT [20,
33] where nodes can communicate with only one interme-
diate hop. Each node performs √e random walks to sample
nodes for construction of their routing tables ; the Sybil re-
sistant property of short random walks ensures that a high
fraction of the sampled nodes are honest
. By querying
routing table entries, nodes can construct their successor
lists. As compared to X-Vine, Whanau provides its proper-
ties at the cost of maintaining √no log no state at each node
(where no is the number of objects). The large state re-
quirements mean that the system has difﬁculty maintaining
accurate state in face of object churn. Whanau also requires
the entire social graph to be public, presenting signiﬁcant
privacy concerns. In contrast, X-Vine builds upon network-
layer DHTs, embedding the DHT directly into the social
network fabric. This enables X-Vine to provide good se-
curity while achieving improved scalability and privacy of
social relationships. Moreover, X-Vine provides support for
pseudonymous communication.
The concept of a bottleneck cut between a fast-mixing
social network and Sybil nodes has been used in a number
of other systems, such as SumUp [60], a protocol for online
content rating that is resilient to Sybil attacks; Ostra [41],
a system to prevent unwanted communication from nodes;
and Kaleidoscope [58], a system for censorship resistance.
Security and privacy in DHTs: Other work deals with the
issue of secure routing when a fraction of nodes in the DHT
are compromised [16,31,46,57,63]. Sit and Morris [57], as
well as Wallach [63] discuss security issues in DHTs. Cas-
tro [16] proposed the use of redundant routing to improve
the lookup security. Nambiar and Wright [46] showed that
redundant lookups in Chord may traverse a few common
nodes, and thus a few malicious nodes could subvert all of
the redundant lookups. They designed the Salsa DHT in
which redundant lookups are unlikely to traverse common
nodes. Kapadia and Triandopoulos [31] propose to make
redundant routes diverse by making use of the observation
that to perform a lookup for A, it sufﬁces to lookup the
nodes which have A as its ﬁnger, and then query them. Un-
like X-Vine these systems are not concerned with the prob-
lem of Sybil attacks. Another line of research deals with the
privacy of the DHT lookup. Borisov [11] as well as Ciac-
cio [18] proposed to incorporate anonymity into the lookup,
but their algorithms do not consider active attacks. More
recently, anonymous and secure lookups were considered
in the designs of Salsa [46], NISAN [48], and Torsk [39].
However, recent work [42, 65] showed vulnerabilities in all
the three designs. X-Vine improves the privacy of a user by
enabling pseudonymous communication; the IP address of
a user is revealed only to a user’s trusted friends.
Social networks and routing: The beneﬁts of using social
network links for overlay routing has been recognized in a
large body of academic work as well as deployed systems.
Hybrid routing using social network links: Systems in this
class maintain traditional peer-to-peer structures but also
make use of social network connections. Sprout [36] pro-
posed augmenting the ﬁnger tables in traditional DHTs,
such as Chord, with social network links. The authors
showed that the added connections could improve the se-
curity of the routing mechanism. However, Sprout does
not defend against Sybil attacks, and is not concerned with
user privacy. OneSwarm [30] is a deployed peer-to-peer
communication system for improving user privacy where
routing is performed by combining trusted and untrusted
peer relationships. Tribler [51] increases download speed
in BitTorrent by discovering and downloading ﬁle chunks
stored at peers. Similarly, Maze [17] leverages a social net-
work to discover peers and cooperatively download ﬁles.
These three systems leverage ﬂooding to provide any-to-
any reachability, and thus cannot scale to large networks.
The hybrid systems are not resilient to Sybil attacks. More-
over, they allow direct contacts over untrusted links, expos-
ing users’ IP addresses.
Routing only using social network links: All communica-
tion in this class of systems is over social network links.
This enables participants in the network to be hidden from
each other, providing a high degree of privacy. Such a net-
work is commonly known as a darknet. WASTE [24] is
a deployed decentralized chat, instant messaging, and ﬁle
sharing protocol, and is widely considered to be the ﬁrst
darknet. WASTE does not attempt to scale beyond small
networks, and its suggested size is limited to 50 users. Tur-
tle [50] is a deployed decentralized anonymous peer-to-peer
communication protocol. Nodes in Turtle do not main-
tain any state information other than their trusted friend
links and use controlled ﬂooding to search for data items.
Flooding methods create signiﬁcant overhead as network
size increases. Freenet [19] is a deployed decentralized
censorship-resistant distributed storage system. Version 0.7
of Freenet nodes can be conﬁgured to run in darknet or
opennet mode; the latter allows connections from untrusted
nodes, and is expected to be used by less privacy-sensitive
users. Freenet’s routing algorithm is heuristic and does not
guarantee that data will be found at all; it has also been
shown to be extremely vulnerable even against a few ma-
licious nodes [23]. Membership concealing overlay net-
works (MCONs) (formalized by Vasserman et al. [61]), hide
the real-world identities of the participants through the use
of overlay and DHT-based routing. However, their design
makes use of a trusted centralized server and also requires
ﬂooding when a new user joins the network. In addition to
these limitations, none of the above systems are resilient to
Sybil attacks.
7 Limitations
We now discuss some limitations of our design. First,
X-Vine requires a user’s social contacts to be part of the
overlay; the DHT needs to be bootstrapped from a sin-
gle contiguous trust network. Next, X-Vine assumes that
Sybil identities are distributed randomly in the DHT iden-
tiﬁer space. We emphasize that this assumption is shared
by prior systems [20], and that defending multi-hop DHTs
against targeted clustering attacks is currently an open prob-
lem.
In future work, we will investigate the possibility
of adapting the cuckoo hashing mechanism [33] proposed
by Lesniewski-Laas (for one-hop DHTs) in the context of
securing multi-hop DHTs. X-Vine also does not defend
against attackers who target users by compromising nodes
close to them in the social network topology. Finally, appli-
cations using X-Vine experience higher than usual latencies
since all communications are pseudonymous and traverse
multiple social network links.
8 Conclusions
We describe X-Vine, a protection mechanism for DHTs
that operates entirely by communicating over social net-
work links. X-Vine requires O(log n) state, two orders of
magnitude less in practical settings as compared with ex-
isting techniques, making it particularly suitable for large-
scale and dynamic environments. X-Vine also enhances pri-
vacy by not revealing social relationship information and by
providing a basis for pseudonymous communication.
