### Analysis

In a 7-hop chain, the goodput, retransmissions, window size, and packet dropping probability were analyzed for different bandwidths. As the bandwidth increases, the number of retransmissions and packet drop probability on the link layer decrease, reducing the likelihood of packet collisions. The performance improvement achieved by ACK thinning is more pronounced for both TCP NewReno and TCP Vegas, as fewer collisions between data and ACK packets enable better utilization of available bandwidth.

Comparing TCP Vegas to other TCP variants, it performs significantly better than TCP NewReno and as well as TCP NewReno with optimal window for all bandwidths. However, TCP Vegas is outperformed by both TCP Vegas with ACK thinning and TCP NewReno with ACK thinning, especially at higher bandwidths (e.g., 11 Mbit/s), where the goodput gap is about 20%.

When compared to the optimal goodput achieved by paced UDP, both TCP Vegas with ACK thinning and TCP NewReno with ACK thinning are close to the optimum, with a goodput gap of at most 32% at 2 Mbit/s and only 23% at 11 Mbit/s. In terms of power consumption, both TCP Vegas and TCP Vegas with ACK thinning are superior to the TCP NewReno variants, as they reduce unnecessary packet retransmissions and conserve shared radio resources by using a smaller TCP window size.

From Figures 11 to 14, we conclude that both TCP Vegas with ACK thinning and TCP NewReno with ACK thinning are the protocols of choice for improving TCP goodput in a chain scenario. In environments with limited energy, TCP Vegas with ACK thinning has an advantage over TCP NewReno with ACK thinning due to its lower power consumption and better resource management.

|--------------------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|---|
| 2                  | 1600 | 1400 | 1200 | 1000 | 800 | 600 | 400 | 200 | 0 |

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the examined TCP variants in more complex scenarios with multiple concurrent flows. The grid consists of 21 nodes, with each node 200 meters apart. We consider a total of six competing FTP flows, three horizontal and three vertical. In such a topology, all flows interfere with each other, increasing contention on the link layer.

For 2 Mbit/s, TCP NewReno slightly outperforms TCP Vegas, whereas for 5.5 and 11 Mbit/s, both variants have almost equal aggregate goodput. Applying ACK thinning for TCP Vegas does not yield any performance improvement for 2 Mbit/s, consistent with the results of the chain simulation. However, as bandwidth availability increases, the performance of TCP Vegas with ACK thinning improves over the performance of TCP Vegas. Similarly, the goodput of TCP NewReno with ACK thinning also increases with increasing bandwidth.

In a topology with multiple flows, the fairness factor plays a significant role in specifying the performance of a TCP variant. Due to the absence of global scheduling in IEEE 802.11, there is a trade-off between the fairness between TCP flows and the aggregate goodput over all flows. Observing the results in Figure 17, we see that while TCP Vegas and TCP NewReno achieve almost identical aggregate goodput, the flows of TCP Vegas achieve more fairness than the flows of TCP NewReno.
