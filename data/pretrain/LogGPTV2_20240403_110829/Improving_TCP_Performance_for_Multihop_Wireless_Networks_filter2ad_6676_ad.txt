Fig 14: 7-hop chain: Packet dropping probability for 
different bandwidths
the 
in  shorter 
transmitted 
retransmissions  on 
transport  and  packet  drop 
probability on the link layer decrease, since data packets 
time,  reducing 
can  be 
the 
probability  for  packet  collisions.  Furthermore, 
the 
improvement  achieved  by  ACK  thinning  increases  for 
both  TCP  NewReno  and  TCP  Vegas,  since  fewer 
collisions of data packets with ACK packets enable better 
utilization  of  available  bandwidth.  Comparing  TCP 
Vegas to the other TCP variants, we find that it performs 
significantly  better  than  TCP  NewReno,  and  as  good  as 
TCP NewReno with optimal window for all bandwidths. 
Nevertheless,  TCP  Vegas  is  outperformed  by  both  TCP 
Vegas with ACK thinning and TCP NewReno with ACK 
thinning for increasing bandwidth availability, with a gap 
of about 20% in goodput for 11 Mbit/s. Comparing both 
TCP Vegas with ACK thinning and TCP NewReno with 
ACK thinning to the optimal goodput achieved by paced 
UDP, we find that  both  are  close to the  optimum  with  a 
goodput gap of at most 32% at 2 Mbit/s, and only 23% at 
11 Mbit/s. Considering power consumption, we find that 
both TCP Vegas and TCP Vegas with ACK thinning are 
superior to the TCP NewReno variants, since they reduce 
packet 
layer. 
Furthermore,  TCP  Vegas  with  ACK  thinning  has  the 
least  link  layer  drops  among  all  variants.  We  conclude 
from  Figures  11  to  14  that  both  TCP  Vegas  with  ACK 
thinning  and  TCP  NewReno  with  ACK thinning  are  the 
protocols  of  choice  for  improving  TCP  goodput  in  a 
chain  scenario.  In  environments  with  limited  energy, 
TCP  Vegas  with  ACK  thinning  gains  advantages  over 
TCP  NewReno  with  ACK  thinning,  since  it  reduces 
power  consumption  by  avoiding  unnecessary  packet 
retransmissions on the one hand and conserves the shared 
radio  resources  by  using  a  smaller  TCP  window  size on 
the other hand.

4.4 TCP  Performance 
in  more 
complex 
Topologies with several concurrent Flows 
In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  examined  TCP 
in  more  complex  scenarios  with  multiple 
variants 
concurrent flows.  
4.4.1
Grid Topology 
Figure  15  shows  the  node  distribution  and  flow 
patterns used for the grid simulation. The grid consists of 
21 nodes, whereas all horizontally and vertically adjacent 
nodes  are  200  meters  apart.  We  consider  a  total  of  six 
increases, 
competing FTP flows, three horizontal and three vertical. 
In  such  topology,  all  flows  interfere  with  each  other, 
increasing contention on the link layer. In this simulation, 
we  do  not  only  consider  the  aggregate  goodput  over  all 
flows, but also the achieved goodput of each flow as well 
as  the  fairness  degree  for  each  of  the  examined  TCP 
variants.  Figure  16  plots  the  aggregate  goodput  of  TCP 
Vegas and TCP NewReno for different bandwidths, both 
with  and  without  ACK  thinning.  We  observe  that  for  2 
Mbit/s, TCP NewReno slightly outperforms TCP Vegas, 
whereas for 5.5 and 11 Mbit/s, both variants have almost 
equal  aggregate  goodput.  Figure  16  further  shows  that 
applying  ACK  thinning  for  TCP  Vegas  does  not  yield 
any  performance  improvement  for  2  Mbit/s,  which  is 
consistent  with  the  results  of  the  chain  simulation. 
However,  as  bandwidth  availability 
the 
performance of TCP Vegas with ACK thinning improves 
over  the  performance  of  TCP  Vegas.  As  for  TCP 
NewReno with ACK thinning, its goodput also increases 
with  increasing  bandwidth,  achieving  higher  values. 
However,  as  we  are  regarding  a  topology  with  multiple 
flows,  the  fairness  factor  plays  a  significant  role  in 
specifying the performance of a TCP variant. Due to the 
absence of global scheduling of IEEE 802.11, there exists 
a trade-off between the fairness between TCP flows and 
the  aggregate  goodput  over  all  flows.  That  is,  the  more 
fairness  is  achieved,  the  more  suffers  the  aggregate 
goodput,  since  the  available  bandwidth  is  not  optimally 
used  due  to  the  increased  contention  between  the  TCP 
flows.  Similar  observations  regarding  such  trade-off 
between  fairness  and  aggregate  goodput  were  made  in 
[14]. In order to investigate the fairness of the examined 
TCP variants, we consider the goodput of each flow for a 
fixed  bandwidth  of  11  Mbit/s.  Observing  the  results  in 
Figure  17,  we  see  that  while  TCP  Vegas  and  TCP 
NewReno achieve almost an identical aggregate goodput, 
the  flows  of  TCP  Vegas  achieve  more  fairness  than  the 
flows of TCP NewReno. Using TCP NewReno, flows
