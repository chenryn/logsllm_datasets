Question: A software company is enhancing its security posture after an incident where adversaries stole OAuth access tokens by phishing. They are evaluating different mitigation strategies and their associated trade-offs. Which of the following strategies would not be effective in preventing the theft of application access tokens and what is a misleading reason for its ineffectiveness?
"A": "Blocking end-user consent to OAuth applications, falsely claimed to have no impact on user experience and productivity.",
"B": "Using audit reports to identify privilege escalation actions, inaccurately deemed ineffective due to the supposed inability to detect real-time attacks.",
"C": "Restricting web-based content to prevent phishing, incorrectly criticized for reducing the attack surface and thus the potential for token theft.",
"D": "Allowing unrestricted user registration of applications, mistakenly justified by the belief that users are knowledgeable enough to avoid malicious applications."
Answer: D
