Similar expenses were top priorities with the LETPP and UASI funding as well, including $2M 
(LETPP) for replacement of the outdated VHF transceivers, $2.8M (UASI) for wide-area 
seamless roaming coverage, and $2.4M (UASI) to purchase equipment to ensure the City of 
North Las Vegas will be compatible with other state and local entities. 
For 05, interoperable radio equipment purchases were fewer in number and cost.  Even so there 
were still a few large projects for southern Nevada including $1.8M (SHSP) for the City of 
Boulder City to achieve interoperability with the surrounding jurisdictions by replacing their old 
VHF system with an APCO 25 compliant 800 MHz system. 
Continuing microwave expansion projects for the southern region were also supported by an 
additional $700K in (SHSP) funding. 
Numerous smaller communities also used their funding to improve and/or upgrade their 
communications systems.

• FY 2004:  $11.2 million to upgrade interoperable communications statewide. 
• FY 2005:  $4.5 million to upgrade multi-discipline interoperable 
communications statewide. 
• Summary:  Interoperable communications is the number one project in New 
Hampshire.  Both the state and locals have invested the majority of their G & T 
funding into their statewide interoperability project.  Modeled after the state’s 
successful LAWNET program, which created statewide interoperability for law 
enforcement, the current project is bringing both fire and EMS onto that system creating 
statewide interoperability 
between those three 
disciplines.

The New Jersey Interoperability Communications System 
(NJICS) The NJICS is a statewide communication system 
comprised of a series of specific interoperable 
communications assets established in each of New Jersey's 
five regions.  These assets include radio cache radios; 
interconnect switches; tactical interoperability channels and region wide 
interoperability channels.  The infrastructure for the NJICS is housed at county and 
local sites in the individual regions.  Using the NJICS, municipal, county, state, and 
federal public safety agencies can achieve interoperability via the radios they own today. 
Using G & T funding (SHSP & UASI) New Jersey's communication capability enhancements 
include: 
• Regional Central Dispatch. 
• Regional tactical interoperability channels throughout the state's regions. 
• Over 2,000 radio cache 
radios distributed 
throughout the state's 
regions. 
• At least 24 radio cache 
radios at each county 
OEM statewide. 
• Radio cache radios are 
uniformly 
preprogrammed with all 
interoperability channels. 
• Radio caches include 21 
interconnect switches for

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
• New Mexico has placed significant emphasis on developing and upgrading 
interoperable communications for first responders in the State.  Four 
significant projects that have been, or will be funded are:  
• Eddy County (SE New Mexico) - A VHF Digital Simulcast System which 
will provide microwave/interoperable communications upgrades in SE 
New Mexico, primarily in Eddy County.  Procures a Digital Simulcast System, which 
will provide secure digital communications providing the ability for all responders in the 
county to communicate securely.  Also, because the system is APCO Project 25 
compliant, it will allow responders to also communicate in a non-secure mode with those 
agencies not on a digital system.  This initiative also provides upgrades to the Eddy 
County Consolidated Dispatch Center and begins procurement of equipment for the 
digital simulcast infrastructure.  System will be compatible with the GSD Digital 
Microwave Backbone currently being installed Statewide.  Funding for Project = 
$685,000.  Additionally, 
funds have been provided 
to the Eddy County 
Sheriff's Dept. for the 
purchase of mobile radios 
and vehicular repeater 
systems.  Funding for 
Project = $205,000 
• San Juan County (NW 
New Mexico) - Provides 
funding for a VHF Digital 
Simulcast System, which

like the system in Eddy County will provide secure digital communications for first 
responders in San Juan County for dispatch throughout NW New Mexico.  The system 
provides the ability to communicate non-securely with those agencies that do not have a 
digital communications capability.  This initiative will also support the Four Corners 
Interoperable Communications Initiative that seeks to enhance interoperable 
communications between NM, AZ, CO and UT.  Funding for Project = $1,678,665  (San 
Juan County has used $1,500,000 in county funds to support this initiative). 
• Interoperable Tactical Communications for SWAT Teams (Statewide) - New Mexico has 
procured standardized/interoperable secure tactical communications for certified SWAT 
teams statewide. Funding for Project = $922,531 
• Statewide Interoperable Communications Architecture - Funding has been requested in 
the FY06 Funding Application to develop a Statewide Interoperable Communications 
Architecture and a State Interoperable Communications Plan.  The plan will build on the 
Digital Microwave Backbone System currently being installed in the State.  Total Cost of 
Project (projected) - $1,500,000

The State of New York has committed the 
expenditure of $2.05 billion dollars over the next 
20 years to immediately engineer, deploy, manage 
and operate a SAFECOM P-25 compliant, I.P. 
addressable wireless voice and data 
communications network. Construction/Development of the 
infrastructure is underway now, with various regions being made operational by March 2007. All 
regions in New York State will be operational by 2010. The NYS Legislature requires that all 
State Agencies participate in migrating their LMR communications systems over to SWN as 
each region is built. Local government, County Government, Tribal Public Safety and Public 
Safety Entities may participate on a completely voluntary level. The chosen level of 
interoperability the Government entity desires will determine the amount of I.P. addressable 
communications equipment that the Locals must purchase. We are hopeful to utilize SHSP 
Funding in cooperation with G&T to offset some of the local purchase costs during the various 
grant years. This was included in our Investment Justification for FY 06 and will also be 
included each year until 2010. 
Significant transition planning, 
fleet mapping, operational 
consolidation and training 
programs are required for each 
interoperable partner. NYS $ 
2.05 billion dollars builds, 
maintains and administers the 
statewide infrastructure and 
network only.
