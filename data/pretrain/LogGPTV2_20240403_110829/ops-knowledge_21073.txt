User: I am running Linux (2.6.18-164.15.1.el5.centos.plus) and trying to install pyodbc.  I am doing pip install pyodbc and get a very long list of errors, which end in 

error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

I looked in  /root/.pip/pip.log and saw the following:

InstallationError: Command /usr/local/bin/python -c "import setuptools; file='/home/build/pyodbc/setup.py'; execfile('/home/build/pyodbc/setup.py')" install --single-version-externally-managed --record /tmp/pip-7MS9Vu-record/install-record.txt failed with error code 1

Has anybody had a similar issue installing pyodbc?
Assistant: A easy way to install pyodbc is by using 'conda'. As conda automatically installs required dependencies including unixodbc.
conda --ugrade all (optional)
then 
conda install pyodbc
it will install following packages:
