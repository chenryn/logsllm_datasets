I understand you are encountering difficulties while trying to install `pyodbc` on your Linux system (version 2.6.18-164.15.1.el5.centos.plus) using `pip`. The error message you provided indicates that the installation process is failing, specifically with a GCC compilation error:

```
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

Additionally, the log file `/root/.pip/pip.log` shows the following error:

```
InstallationError: Command /usr/local/bin/python -c "import setuptools; file='/home/build/pyodbc/setup.py'; execfile('/home/build/pyodbc/setup.py')" install --single-version-externally-managed --record /tmp/pip-7MS9Vu-record/install-record.txt failed with error code 1
```

This issue can be quite common and is often related to missing dependencies or configuration issues.

### Suggested Solution: Using `conda` for Installation

One effective way to resolve this issue is by using `conda`, which automatically handles the installation of required dependencies, including `unixODBC`.

#### Steps to Install `pyodbc` Using `conda`:

1. **(Optional) Upgrade `conda` and all installed packages:**
   ```bash
   conda update --all
   ```

2. **Install `pyodbc` using `conda`:**
   ```bash
   conda install pyodbc
   ```

This command will install `pyodbc` along with its necessary dependencies. Here is a list of some of the packages that might be installed as part of this process:

- `libgfortran-ng`: 7.2.0-hdf63c60_3
- `mkl`: 2018.0.3-1
- `mkl_fft`: 1.0.2-py36_0
- `mkl_random`: 1.0.1-py36_0
- `numpy-base`: 1.14.5-py36hdbf6ddf_0
- `pyodbc`: 4.0.17-py36_0
- `unixodbc`: 2.3.4-1

By using `conda`, you can avoid many of the common issues associated with manually installing dependencies and compiling from source. If you do not already have `conda` installed, you can follow the instructions from the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) documentation to set it up.

If you continue to experience issues or need further assistance, please provide additional details about your environment and any other relevant information.
