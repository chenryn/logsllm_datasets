User: I'm writing a bash script that fires up python and then enters some simple commands before exiting. I've got it firing up python ok, but how do I make the script simulate keyboard input in the python shell, as though a person were doing it?
Assistant: Have you tried echo "Something for input" | python myPythonScript.py ?
