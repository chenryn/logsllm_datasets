  "Sandbox: com.apple.Addres(31229) deny(1) network-outbound /private/var/run/mDNSResponder",  "This log is indicating that the process \"com.apple.Address\" (with a process ID of 31229) attempted to make an outbound network connection from the location \"/private/var/run/mDNSResponder\" on the system, but was denied. \"mDNSResponder\" is a system daemon that handles multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) responses, often used in Bonjour networking. \n\nThe \"deny(1)\" in the log indicates that the connection was denied by a rule in the system's security policy. The source code name for this policy is \"sandbox,\" which suggests that this was a decision made by the system's \"sandboxing\" feature. Sandboxing restricts an application's access to certain system resources, usually to prevent malicious activity or limit inadvertent system damage. \n\nThe specific reason for the denial is not provided in this log, but it may be related to the restricted access to the \"mDNSResponder\" daemon, or to broader network restrictions defined by the security policy. Troubleshooting this issue may require a deeper investigation of the sandboxing rules and configurations on the system to determine why this connection was not allowed."
