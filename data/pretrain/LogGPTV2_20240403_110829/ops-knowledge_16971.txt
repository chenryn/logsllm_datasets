I have developed a UDP hole puncher in Python using raw sockets, and I am looking for a service or an external server (such as a dedicated server) that can host and run this program. 

I initially considered using OpenShift, but it did not meet my requirements because it uses Apache as a proxy, which makes it impossible to use raw sockets for the necessary connections.

Ideally, I would prefer a free solution. 

Thank you very much for your assistance.

Unfortunately, OpenShift will not be suitable for your needs. It only supports two types of external ports: HTTP/HTTPS and WS/WSS. These limitations prevent the use of raw sockets, which are essential for your UDP hole puncher.

You may want to consider other cloud providers or services that offer more flexibility with network configurations. Some options that might support raw sockets include DigitalOcean, AWS, or even some VPS (Virtual Private Server) providers. While these may not be entirely free, they often offer free trials or limited free tiers that could be sufficient for testing and small-scale deployments.

If you need a completely free solution, you might also look into community-driven projects or open-source platforms that provide more control over the networking stack. However, please note that these options may require more setup and maintenance on your part.

Best of luck with your project!
