User: I had built a python udp hole puncher using raw socket and I wonder whether is there a service, or an option to use an external server, on the web(like dedicated server) that will host and run this program.
openshift was something i considered but it  did not work because it uses apache is a proxy and therefore its impossible to use raw sockets for connection.
I prefer a free solution
thanks a lot
Assistant: That will not work on OpenShift, we only offer two kinds of external ports for use, http/https and ws/wss
