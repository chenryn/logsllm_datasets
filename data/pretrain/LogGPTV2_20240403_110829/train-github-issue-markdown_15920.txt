# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
`webpack-dev-server` (via `webpack serve`) compiles twice on every save in
VSCode. This doesn't happen when using an other editor such as Sublime.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
Create a fresh package with `webpack`, `webpack-cli` and `webpack-dev-server`
as `devDependencies`.
    // src/index.js
    console.log("Hi");
Launch the server:
    webpack serve --mode=production
Open the `src/index.js` file in VSCode. You'll notice in the console's output
that every time you press save, the code gets compiled twice. Try with an
other editor (such as Sublime) and you'll see that compilation occurs once, as
expected.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Compilation should occur only once.
