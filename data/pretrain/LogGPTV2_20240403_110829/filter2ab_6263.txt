### Title: efiXplorer: Hunting for UEFI Firmware Vulnerabilities at Scale with Automated Static Analysis

**Abstract:**

Current UEFI analysis tools lack a systematic approach to vulnerability research, particularly for x86-based systems. There are no publicly available tools specifically designed for static analysis of UEFI firmware vulnerabilities. While many common reversing tools simplify certain reconstruction routines, they do not provide a comprehensive view based on the entire firmware image. Previous work in this area has primarily focused on misconfiguration issues, such as Secure Boot not being enabled or unauthenticated firmware updates.

In this presentation, we introduce a novel vulnerability research approach that leverages unique static analysis techniques to identify vulnerable code patterns. The efiXplorer plugin reconstructs key elements and data types, such as EFI protocols, by analyzing the full firmware image and establishing cross-references. This process is crucial for UEFI reverse engineering, as it helps uncover issues like SMM (Intel System Management Mode) callouts, where pointers reference unvalidated buffers in untrusted memory (e.g., NVRAM, ACPI) controlled by an attacker.

**Key Features of efiXplorer:**

- **Comprehensive Reconstruction:** The efiXplorer plugin, which is the most comprehensive open-source IDA plugin for UEFI reverse engineering, reconstructs key elements and data types, providing valuable cross-references.
- **Vulnerability Detection:** It is specifically designed to detect a wide range of UEFI firmware vulnerabilities, including those related to SMM callouts and other critical issues.
- **Open-Source and Ongoing Development:** The authors have recently open-sourced the efiXplorer plugin and continue to enhance it, with a focus on vulnerability research.

**Impact and Results:**

The efiXplorer plugin has already discovered multiple previously unreported vulnerabilities in recent, widely used hardware platforms from major vendors, including ASUS, ASRock, MSI, Gigabyte, Lenovo, and others. During this briefing, we will release a new version of the plugin with enhanced functionality to automatically trigger and detect the presented classes of vulnerabilities.

By leveraging efiXplorer, security researchers and developers can more effectively identify and mitigate UEFI firmware vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security of x86-based systems.
