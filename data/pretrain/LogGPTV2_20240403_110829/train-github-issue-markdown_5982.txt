# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18363.836
    PowerToys version: v0.18.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Open a new window, observe the window size
  2. Snap the window to a FancyZone (like the lower priority zone in the Priority Grid template)
  3. Drag the window to unsnap it
# Expected behavior
On drag/unsnap, the window reverts back to its original size before it was
snapped, and subsequent new instances of the app open to the original size.

# Actual behavior
The window retains the size of the FancyZone. At least for Win32 apps like
Edge and Teams, new instances of the app also open to the FancyZone size
unless you manually resize the window to the desired size (effectively the
original size). UWP apps tend to set a preferred size I guess so new instances
don't seem to be as impacted by the sizes of earlier windows. This is
different from how Windows Snap works which does preserve the original window
size when unsnapping.

# Additional Notes
When using FancyZones, I find myself needing to resize windows where I never
needed to before. This is effectively a regression from Windows Snap.
