logic with the capital within a transaction. If the loan plus the re-
quired interests are not repaid, the whole transaction is reverted
without incurring any state change on the underlying blockchain
(i.e., the flash loan never happened). Flash loans are shown to be
widely used in liquidations [30].
Stablecoin. Stablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies de-
2.2.3
signed to provide low price volatility [12]. The price of a stablecoin
is generally pegged to some reference point (e.g., USD). The typical
stablecoin mechanisms are reserve of the pegged asset (e.g., USDT
and USDC), loans (e.g., DAI), dual coin, and algorithmic supply
adjustments [25].
2.3 Terminology
We adhere to the following terminologies in this paper.
Loan/Debt: A borrower, secured by a collateral deposit, temporar-
ily takes capital from a lender. The collateral is the insurance
of the lender against defaults.
Interest Rate: A loan is repaid by repaying the lent amount, plus
a periodic percentage of the loan amount. The interest rate
can be governed by the scarcity/surplus of the available asset
supply within the lending smart contract.
Over/Under-collateralization: Blockchain based loans are typ-
ically over-collateralized, i.e., the borrower has to provide
collateral assets of higher total value than the granted loan. A
loan is under-collateralized when the value of the collateral
is inferior to the debt.
Position: In this work, the collateral and debts are collectively
referred to as a position. A position may consist of multiple-
cryptocurrency collaterals and debts.
Liquidation: In the event of a negative price fluctuation of the
debt collateral (i.e., a move below the liquidation threshold),
a position can be liquidated. In permissionless blockchains,
anyone can repay the debt and claim the collateral.
Liquidation Threshold (LT): Is the percentage at which the col-
lateral value is counted towards the borrowing capacity (cf.
Equation 3).
Liquidation Spread (LS): Is the bonus, or discount, that a liquida-
tor can collect when liquidating collateral (cf. Equation 1).
This spread incentivises liquidators to act promptly once a
loan crosses the liquidation threshold.

Close Factor (CF): Is the maximum proportion of the debt that is
allowed to be repaid in a single liquidation.
Collateralization Ratio (CR): Is the ratio between the total value
of collateral and debt (cf. Equation 2) where 𝑖 represents the
index of collateral or debt if the borrower owns collateral or
owes debt in multiple cryptocurrencies.

A debt is under-collateralized if CR  𝑑𝑖−1. If the auction terminates in the tend phase,
the winning bidder receives all the collateral (i.e., 𝐶). When 𝑑𝑖
reaches 𝐷, the auction moves into the dent phase.
Dent: In the dent phase, liquidators compete by bidding to accept
decreasing amounts of collateral in exchange for the full debt
(i.e., 𝐷) they will end up repaying. We denote the amount of
collateral committed in each bid by 𝑐𝑖, s.t. 𝑐𝑖 ≤ 𝐶 and 𝑐𝑖 <
𝑐𝑖−1. The winning bidder repays the full debt and receives the

partial collateral (denoted by 𝑐win). The remaining collateral (i.e.,
𝐶 − 𝑐win) is returned to the position owner (i.e., the borrower).
The auction terminates when any of the following two conditions
is satisfied. Note that the auction can terminate in the tend phase.
(1) Auction Length Condition: the configurable auction length
(e.g., 6 hours) has passed since the initiation of the auction.
(2) Bid Duration Condition: the configurable bid duration
(e.g., 5 hours) has passed since the last bid.
After the termination of an auction, the winning liquidator is
allowed to finalize the liquidation to claim the proposed collateral.
Fixed Spread Liquidation. Instead of allowing multiple liq-
3.2.2
uidators to bid over a time-frame, a liquidatable loan can be instantly
liquidated with a pre-determined discount (cf. Figure 1). Aave, for
instance, allows liquidators to purchase the loan collateral at up to a
15% discount of the current market price. This discount, or liquida-
tion spread, is known upfront, and the liquidators can hence locally
decide whether to engage in a liquidation opportunity. Following a
fixed spread model avoids hour-long liquidation auctions, which
cost time and transaction fees. Liquidators, moreover, can choose
to liquidate collateral with the use of atomic flash loans [30]. While
flash loans increase the transaction costs of the liquidators, they
reduce the currency exposure risk of holding the assets required
for liquidation.
Fixed Spread Liquidation Example. In the following, we provide
an example of a fixed spread liquidation:
(1) Currency values: We assume an initial price of 3,500 US-
D/ETH.
(2) Collateral Deposit: A user deposits 3 ETH, and hence has
10,500 USD worth of collateral. If we assume a liquidation
threshold (LT, cf. Section 2.3) of 0.8, the resulting borrowing
capacity of the user is BC = 10,500 USD × LT = 8,400 USD.
(3) Borrowing: In the next step the user borrows, for instance,
8,400 USDC worth 8,400 USD.
(4) ETH price decline: We now assume that the ETH value
declines to 3,300 USD/ETH, which means that the collateral
value declines to 9,900 USD with BC = 7,920 USD. The price
oracle updates the ETH price on the lending smart contract.
8,400 USD ≈
7,920 USD
The health factor of the loan now drops to HF =
0.94 < 1 and thus the collateral is available for liquidation.
(5) Liquidation: A liquidator submits a liquidation transaction
to repay 50% (close factor CF, cf. Section 2.3) of the debt, i.e.,
4,200 USDC. In return, the liquidator is allowed to purchase
collateral at the price of 3,300 USD/ETH
= 3,000 USD/ETH (we
assume that the liquidation spread LS is 10%, cf. Section 2.3).
3,000 USD/ETH ×
4,200 USD
In this liquidation, the liquidator receives
3,300 USD/ETH = 4,620 USD worth of ETH and realizes a
profit of 420 USD.

3.3 Studied Lending Protocols
Within this work we focus on the biggest lending protocols, mea-
sured by total value locked, notably MakerDAO (12.49B USD), Aave
(11.20B USD), Compound (10.15B USD), and dYdX (247.6M USD).
Aave is a pool-based lending and borrowing protocol [4]. Lenders
deposit assets into a pool governed by open-source smart contracts,
and borrowers can then take loans out of this pool. The interest rate
of an Aave pool is decided algorithmically by the smart contract and
depends on the available funds within the lending pool. The more
users borrow an asset, the higher its interest rate rises. A lending
pool can consist of several cryptocurrency assets, for instance ETH,
DAI, and USDC. In Aave, when the health factor drops below 1,
any liquidator can call the public pool function liquidationCall, by
repaying parts or all of the outstanding debt, while profiting from
the liquidation spread. Aave specifies that only a maximum of 50%
of the debt can be liquidated within one liquidationCall execution
(referred to as a close factor). The liquidation spread on Aave ranges
from 5% to 15%, depending on the considered markets. Aave bases
its pricing feed on the external Chainlink oracle [33]. Aave was
upgraded to a newer version in December 2020 while the core
protocols remained nearly unchanged. In this work, we distinguish
the two versions with Aave V1 and Aave V2.
Compound [19] launched before Aave and operates in a similar
fashion. Users deposit assets and earn interests based on the amount
of interests paid by borrowers. When a borrower exceeds the bor-
rowing capacity, at most 50% of outstanding debt can be repaid at
once by a liquidator (same as the close factor in Aave). The liqui-
dation may continue until the collateral guarantees a health factor
superior to one. The liquidator in exchange receives the collateral
at the current market price minus the liquidation spread.
dYdX [17] is divided into two sub-protocols, one for trading,
borrowing, lending and one that also supports futures markets.
Similar to Aave and Compound, dYdX operates at a fixed spread
of 5% for the WETH/USDC, WETH/DAI and USDC/DAI markets,
at the time of writing. dYdX’s close factor is 100%, allowing the
liquidators to liquidate the entire collateral within one liquidation.
Contrary to the aforementioned borrowing/lending protocols,
MakerDAO provides a decentralized stablecoin called DAI that is
pegged to the US dollar, while still functioning financially similar
to a borrowing/lending platform. A user can collateralize at least,
e.g., 150% of a crypto asset (for instance ETH) to mint 100% DAI.
Creating DAI opens a so-called collateralized debt position (CDP),
which can be liquidated if the collateralized value drops below the
fixed collateralization ratio. MakerDAO adopts an auction-based
liquidation mechanism (cf. Section 3.2).
4 LIQUIDATION INSIGHTS
By observing the publicly readable Ethereum blockchain we com-
piled the following insights on liquidation events.
4.1 Measurement Setup
Our measurement setup is outlined in Figure 3. We gather our data
by crawling blockchain events (e.g., liquidation events) and reading
blockchain states (e.g., oracle prices) from an Ethereum full archive
