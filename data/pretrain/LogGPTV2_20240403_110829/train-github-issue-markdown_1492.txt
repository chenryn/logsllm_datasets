Relevant StackOverflow question (which I actually just posted to).
I understand this isn't a showstopper but actually made me research a while
before realizing there was also a `row` parameter that was meant to be used.
Perhaps a error message could be displayed?
If you tell me what the intended behavior is I can try and make a pull request
fixing it. ðŸ˜„
