User: Please explain what is load balancing and how to use Nginx to achieve load balancing?
Assistant: 1. What is load balancing? Load balancing (Load Balancing) refers to the balanced distribution of a large amount of network traffic to multiple servers in order to improve the performance, scalability and availability of the application system. 2. How to use Nginx to achieve load balancing? Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server, as well as an excellent load balancer. Through the load balancing function of Nginx, client requests can be evenly distributed to multiple servers to achieve the purpose of increasing service capabilities, optimizing service quality, and improving service reliability. The specific implementation steps are as follows: 1) Install Nginx 2) Configure load balancing strategy In the Nginx configuration file, define multiple server nodes through the upstream module, and configure its weight, proxy protocol and other information. For example: upstream backend { server 192.168.1.11:8080 weight=5; server 192.168.1.12:8080; server 192.168.1.13:8080; } Among them, weight represents the weight, and the larger the value, the higher the server load, and will be allocated to more Fewer requests. If a server fails, Nginx will automatically remove it from the node list. 3) Configure virtual hosts Configure different sites and virtual hosts according to actual needs. For example: server { listen 80; server_name www.example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } In this example, Nginx listens to port 80. When there is a request to visit www.example.com, Nginx will Forward the request to the backend node of the upstream module, and perform weight distribution according to the load balancing strategy. 4) Reload configuration and test After completing the above steps, you need to restart the Nginx service and test whether the load balancing function is normal. In a high-concurrency scenario, you can use Nginx's logging and monitoring tools to view the usage of the server and the request volume of each node to help optimize the effect of load balancing.
