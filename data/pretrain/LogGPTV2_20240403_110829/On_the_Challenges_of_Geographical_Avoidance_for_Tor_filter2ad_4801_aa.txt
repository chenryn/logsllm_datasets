Abstract—Trafﬁc-analysis attacks are a persisting threat for
Tor users. When censors or law enforcement agencies try to
identify users, they conduct trafﬁc-conﬁrmation attacks and mon-
itor encrypted transmissions to extract metadata—in combination
with routing attacks, these attacks become sufﬁciently powerful to
de-anonymize users. While trafﬁc-analysis attacks are hard to de-
tect and expensive to counter in practice, geographical avoidance
provides an option to reject circuits that might be routed through
an untrusted area. Unfortunately, recently proposed solutions
introduce severe security issues by imprudent design decisions.
In this paper, we approach geographical avoidance starting
from a thorough assessment of its challenges. These challenges
serve as the foundation for the design of an empirical avoid-
ance concept that considers actual transmission characteristics
for justiﬁed decisions. Furthermore, we address the problems
of untrusted or intransparent ground truth information that
hinder a reliable assessment of circuits. Taking these features
into account, we conduct an empirical simulation study and
compare the performance of our novel avoidance concept with
existing approaches. Our results show that we outperform existing
systems by 22 % fewer rejected circuits, which reduces the
collateral damage of overly restrictive avoidance decisions. In
a second evaluation step, we extend our initial system concept
and implement the prototype TrilateraTor. This prototype is the
ﬁrst to satisfy the requirements of a practical deployment, as
it maintains Tor’s original level of security, provides reasonable
performance, and overcomes the fundamental security ﬂaws of
existing systems.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Tor enables anonymous communication on the Internet
as it allows to separate one’s identity from what is being
read, watched, bought, or shared. Such protection is put to
good use in cases where this additional layer of anonymity
helps journalists, whistleblowers, or everyday supporters of
the digital freedom to stay safe under oppressive regimes
and Internet censorship. At the same time, Tor’s anonymity
holds opportunities for illegal activities. Both cases serve
as motivation for censorship authorities [54] as well as law
enforcement agencies [1] to hinder the use of Tor and to
monitor what is going on in the “dark parts” of the Internet.

We can circumvent blocked Tor access in different
ways [17], but users never know if someone analyzes their
trafﬁc [18], [30], [36]. Low-cost countermeasures do not sufﬁ-
ciently protect metadata [13] and obfuscating trafﬁc against
correlation leads to per-packet delays [28]. However, we
gain trust in a connection by avoiding paths through critical
countries. Such circumvention becomes even more important
since we know that, e. g., monitoring a circuit’s middle relay is
already sufﬁcient to identify onion services [21]. Sophisticated
path selection [4], [8] is a starting point for this approach, but
systems tend to focus on performance features [48] rather than
geographical characteristics.
it
DeTor [31], proposed by Li et al. in 2017, makes an at-
tempt to provide provable geographical avoidance of untrusted
countries. Provable avoidance means that
is impossible
for an established Tor circuit to have traversed a forbidden
area. This does not only apply to the avoidance of relays
located in a speciﬁc country, but also considers the Internet
routing between the client and server. DeTor uses an approach
comparable to the principle of distance bounding: instead of
depending on hardware solutions [5] or the modiﬁcation of
routing protocols [38], it uses the Round-Trip Time (RTT) of
a connection and compares it to a theoretical lower bound
for reaching the forbidden area. The lower bound is estimated
using the geographical locations of relays in the circuit and
utilizes the fact that transmissions through the Internet can
never be faster than approximately 2/3 of the speed of light [31].
Unfortunately, several design ﬂaws hinder DeTor from
providing a convincing solution for geographical avoidance.
(i) DeTor does not consider the diverse network infrastructure
of Tor and the underlying network, e. g., it applies one static
decision threshold for all circuits. Tor’s skewed distribution
of relays leads to various circuit lengths that cannot offer
the same performance features for all users. Applying the
same threshold even for varying connection characteristics
leads to overly restrictive avoidance decisions. Furthermore,
(ii) DeTor makes false assumptions on the available ground
truth information. In particular, it assumes symmetric routes,
miscalculates the distance within the lower bound detection
mechanism, and ultimately accepts connections traversing for-
bidden areas. This contradicts the “provable” security guaran-
tee for geographical avoidance. Furthermore, DeTor accepts
external GeoIP information without any further veriﬁcation
and overlooks the chances of using false locations as the
foundation for a decision. Finally, (iii) DeTor was designed
without considering the constraints of real-world deployment.
By sending timing probes through the entire circuit, the system
reveals the connection endpoints even before we can be sure
about the security of this circuit. This opens up new attack
vectors instead of protecting against potential threats. We argue
that all of these ﬂaws are unnecessary and introduce strict
security and performance issues that render the system hardly
usable for an actual deployment.
In our work, we approach the general problem of geo-
graphical avoidance systematically and begin with a deﬁnition
of its challenges. We introduce three classes of challenges that
we identify as the general pitfalls of geographical avoidance,
namely, the demanding characteristics of Tor’s (i) network
diversity, the lack of trusted (ii) ground truth information, and
the requirements of a real-world (iii) deployment. Tackling
these challenges, we propose a new timing-based avoidance
system that overcomes design ﬂaws of existing systems. We
back up the theory of these challenges with a preliminary
assessment of Tor’s network infrastructure and the transmission
characteristics of the underlying network. Our results show
that the skewed distribution of Tor relays that we measured
empirically not only leads to different levels of anonymity
for users, but also affects the essential end-to-end timing of
messages sent through the network. Ignoring this diversity
means to over-simplify the decision process with consequences
for either Tor’s security or performance. We ﬁnd that accepting
external GeoIP information as ground truth for relay positions
is error-prone and can impact geographical avoidance deci-
sions. False locations would imply propagation speeds that
exceed the speed of light and, with that, are provably wrong
from a physical perspective. We verify the GeoIP information
and identify false locations by applying this physical proof to
improve the information through trilateration [19].
The assessment of challenges is our foundation to propose
technical solutions and design a new, empirical avoidance
concept. Empirical avoidance has two main beneﬁts. First, it
allows considering hop-individual transmission characteristics
rather than one static threshold for different connections.
Consequently, we can apply avoidance decisions concerning
the various performance characteristics of Tor and step back
from the collateral damage of overly restrictive decisions.
Second, we derive the hop-individual timing estimates from
distributed measurements of several reference points. This dis-
tributed approach adds another level of security, as it allows to
represent single connections through empirical data that cannot
be manipulated by an adversary prolonging messages [47]. In a
ﬁrst evaluation step, we analyze the performance of our novel
avoidance concept and compare it to existing approaches.
In a second step, we introduce the prototype implementa-
tion TrilateraTor that is the ﬁrst also to satisfy the requirements
of a real-world deployment. TrilateraTor introduces a novel
measurement
technique that derives a circuit’s end-to-end
timing directly from the NTor handshake in Tor’s circuit estab-
lishment procedure. As the establishment of several ready-to-
use circuits is part of Tor’s startup procedure, the use of Trilate-
raTor neither induces any delays through preliminary probing
nor information leaks. Along with additional veriﬁcation steps
for untrusted ground truth information and the less restrictive
empirical avoidance concept, TrilateraTor provides realistic
answers to the challenges of geographical avoidance. We
analyze the performance of our prototype implementation in
another empirical simulation study, discuss the organizational
steps of a practical deployment, and provide a detailed security
analysis. Our contributions are as follows.
• Challenges of Geographical Avoidance. We assess the
problem of geographical avoidance in Tor and identify
three classes of challenges. These classes address the di-
versity of Tor’s infrastructure and the underlying network,
the lack of ground truth information, and the constraints
arising from the real-world deployment of an avoidance
system.
• Preliminary Measurements. We conduct an empirical
evaluation of Tor’s infrastructure to conﬁrm the relevance
of the above challenges. Our results show that a skewed
relay distribution cannot provide the same anonymity for
all and can limit the success of an avoidance system.
Furthermore, we identify a false assumption that hinders
DeTor [31] from providing provable avoidance.
• Experimental Evaluation. Starting from the assessment
of the given network infrastructure, we introduce solu-
tions for the set of challenges and compare their per-
formances in an empirical simulation study. In a second
step, we propose, implement, and evaluate TrilateraTor,
our approach to take the constraints of a real-world
deployment into account.
II. BACKGROUND
Before we deﬁne fundamental challenges for avoidance
and provide possible solutions for a system deployment, we
introduce some background on the context of geographical
avoidance. This background explains why trafﬁc-analysis at-
tacks harm the anonymity of Tor users, how routing attacks
can render this situation a real-world threat, and introduces the
technical background of trilateration. Furthermore, we discuss
which attacker model we consider and brieﬂy summarize the
functionality of DeTor.
A. Motivation: Trafﬁc-Analysis Attacks
Tor does not protect the metadata that is present in the TCP
and IP packet headers or that can be derived from time rela-
tions. An adversary that is capable of monitoring transmissions
can thus analyze patterns, such as the inter-arrival times of
packets that result in individual features for different streams,
and use the information to match streams, thus learning the
relations between transmissions and users. Countermeasures
against trafﬁc analysis impose a high overhead as they require
the obfuscation of metadata, which can only be achieved at
the expense of performance impairments.
Passive attacks monitor transmissions to perform end-to-
end matches between clients and servers [30], [43], [58].
They use correlation metrics that estimate the similarity of
ingress and egress trafﬁc or analyze the statistical character-
istics of streams [11], [12], [26], [34] to make an educated
guess on potential relations. Active attacks extend this by
targeted manipulations of trafﬁc, e. g., watermarking [49]–
[51] or coding [32], [33], [42], [56] approaches may inject
characteristic patterns at one end of the connection to increase
the correlation of transmissions. Such attacks can reduce the
required monitoring overhead, but tend to be less stealthy due
to their active interference.
2
All correlation attacks have one aspect in common: A suc-
cessful attack requires to monitor trafﬁc through the involved
nodes and will be more successful for adversaries that can put
themselves in advantageous positions. Geographical avoidance
helps to avoid such areas, but its circumvention is challenged
by active routing attacks.
B. Ampliﬁer: Routing Attacks
When a user at location A accesses a website hosted at
location B, all messages must be routed through a set of nodes
and organizational units to reach their target and to be sent
back. The path of a circuit does not only depend on the choice
of relays, but also on the routing conditions between the relays.
Adversaries use routing attacks [9], [39] to manipulate such
paths, forcing trafﬁc through areas that are under adversarial
control.
The Internet is divided into autonomous systems (AS),
large organizational units that provide the service of forward-
ing messages to the desired destination. Routing between ASes
is managed by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which
deﬁnes rule sets for ASes that agreed to connect to each other.
Hence, BGP manages available and unavailable connections.
As a result, the BGP routing tables deﬁne the paths a message
will take when it is transmitted from A to B. As soon as an
adversary manages to alter the routing tables, she is capable
of forcing trafﬁc through regions she is in control of.
AS-level adversaries can manipulate Tor routing [9] or
perform BGP hijacks [39], [44] to force trafﬁc to be routed to
the adversarial preﬁx, e. g., to a Tor exit node that forwards
large amounts of trafﬁc. BGP hijacks blackhole trafﬁc and
allows for the observation of transmitted data, but this results
in dropped connections that may reveal the adversarial activ-
ity. To overcome this, more sophisticated BGP interception
attacks [7] force the adversarial AS to be at an intermediate
point of the path. In this case, the connection is kept alive and
allows the attacker to monitor the transmissions. BGP hijacks
and interceptions empower trafﬁc-analysis attacks, increase
the probability of successfully de-anonymizing users in the
network, or help learn the positions of critical nodes on the
network. Nevertheless, routing changes inﬂuence the RTT of
a transmission, and we can exploit this fact for the design of
an avoidance system.
C. Technique: Trilateration
As a means to geographically localize Tor relays, we make
use of trilateration. This technique is based upon measured
distances to multiple known reference points. This widespread
approach is used in, e. g., satellite navigation systems (such as
GPS) or to determine the location of mobile phones in radio
cells, and utilizes time or signal strength differences between
reference points [19]. In the context of geographical avoidance,
we utilize the round-trip times from one node to multiple
reference servers to derive hop-individual time references.
The underlying theoretical model can be summarized as

follows. The unknown location of a relay
R is denoted
by (x, y)1. As references, we use RTT measurements from n

RTTs t1, t2, . . . , tn between known references and the respec-
tive relay. These timings are related to geographic distances
considering a typical transmission speed v of up to 2/3 of the
speed of light. Having three or more geographic distances
allows us to pinpoint the target by intersecting circles with
radii corresponding to the estimated distances.
Due to noise in RTT measurements, the resulting circles do
not intersect in a distinct point but rather mark a target area. To
−→
ﬁnd the most likely position
R , we use a weighted root-mean-
square error approach. This correction technique optimizes the
result towards the minimal error with respect to all reference
measurements:
R
where ωi
is a normalized weighting factor based on the
distance to the reference. In particular, smaller RTTs are
expected to be less affected by noise and consequently have
higher weight in the error minimization process. The output
of Equation 1 is the most likely relay position with minimal
error.
D. Scope: Attacker Model
Throughout this work, we follow attacker models proposed
in the literature and assume an AS-level adversary who can
cover between 40 % (single malicious AS) and 85 % (state
level adversary, colluding ASes) [40] of nodes in an attack.
The attacker is capable of performing routing attacks, e. g.,
BGP hijacks [44] for redirecting user trafﬁc, and trafﬁc-
analysis attacks [18], [21], [36] with the goal of learning
sensitive information about Tor users. This may be achieved
by having access to relays in the Tor network (by contributing
