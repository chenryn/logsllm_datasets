User: How to conduct network security assessment and penetration testing? Please provide an assessment and testing scenario and explain how vulnerability scanning, security scanning, penetration testing, etc. will be performed.
Assistant: Network security assessment and penetration testing are to assess the network security status of an enterprise or organization and discover the loopholes and weaknesses in it. The following is a basic assessment and testing scenario, and includes steps on how to conduct vulnerability scanning, security scanning, penetration testing, etc. Assessment and testing plan: 1. Determine the objectives and scope of assessment and testing: Determine the network scope and objectives that need to be assessed and tested. This can include internal networks, external networks, websites, applications, and more. 2. Collect information: Collect company and network information, analyze existing security measures, understand the organization's security deployment and security processes, and existing IT infrastructure. 3. Vulnerability Scanning: Use a vulnerability scanner to scan target networks and applications for vulnerabilities. Scan results detail vulnerabilities in your network and applications, and how to address them. 4. Security scan: Perform a security scan, including checking network and application configuration, vulnerabilities, malware, and exploits, etc. Security scanning can discover security issues by detecting and analyzing ports, VPNs, SSL certificates, and server shutdowns unexpectedly. 5. Penetration testing: Penetration testing is performed, which is a step further in which the tester simulates an attack, trying to gain access to the network, applications, and workstations. Penetration testing is more of a "black box" testing approach, where the tester doesn't know the details of the application and network in the overall scope of the test. 6. Writing reports: Write reports based on test results and findings, including necessary suggestions and improvement measures, submit to customers, and evaluate and review all results and reports. Vulnerability scanning: Vulnerability scanning runs on known network service ports to discover and evaluate vulnerabilities in the form of heuristics and signature checks. Scanners discover hosts by broadcasting packets on the target network, interrogating devices affected by the broadcast packets to determine their identification information. The scanner will then initially interact with all identified devices to learn about the services running on them. Security scan: Security scan can detect the security configuration of the network, including firewall, VPN, router, etc. Scanning can discover security issues by detecting and analyzing ports, VPNs, SSL certificates, unexpected server shutdowns, and more. Scanning can be done with automatic tools or manual tools. Penetration testing: Penetration testing is the use of security tools to simulate attacks at multiple stages of a network or application in order to assess the severity of security threats and security vulnerabilities of concern. Penetration testing is usually performed by one or more security tools and human skills to simulate the behavior of a malicious attacker. Penetration testing can be done through manual or automated testing. Manual testing is an advanced testing technique that requires specific skills and expertise. Automated testing is a fixed testing process to consider and can be performed with most penetration testing tools. In conclusion, cybersecurity assessment and penetration testing is a very important business that must be performed by professionals with specialized skills and experience.
