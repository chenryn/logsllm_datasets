Table 2: Percentage of responses from the services with correct answers for the language CAPTCHAs.
6.3 Worker Wages
Kolotibablo pays workers at a variable rate depending on
how many CAPTCHAs they have solved. This rate varies
from $0.50/1,000 up to over $0.75/1,000 CAPTCHAs.
PixProﬁt is the equivalent supplier for DeCaptcher and
offers a somewhat higher rate of $1/1,000. Typically,
workers must earn a minimum amount of money be-
fore payout ($3.00 at PixProﬁt and $1.00 at Kolotibablo),
and services commonly provide payment via an online e-
currency system such as WebMoney.
While we cannot directly measure the gross wages
paid by either service, Kolotibablo provides a public list
to its workers detailing the monthly earnings for the top
100 solvers each day (presumably as a worker incentive).
We monitored these earnings for two months beginning
on Dec. 1st, 2009. On this date, the average monthly
payout among the top 100 workers was $106.31. How-
ever, during December, Kolotibablo revised its bonus
payout system, which reduced the payout range by ap-
proximately 50% (again reﬂecting downward price pres-
sure on CAPTCHA-solving labor). As a result, one month
later on Jan. 1st, 2010, the average monthly payout to
the top 100 earners decreased to $47.32. In general,
these earnings are roughly consistent with wages paid to
low-income textile workers in Asia [12], suggesting that
CAPTCHA-solving is being outsourced to similar labor
pools; we investigate this question next.
6.4 Geolocating Workers
We crafted CAPTCHAs whose solutions would reveal
information about the geographic demographics of the
CAPTCHA solvers. We created CAPTCHAs using words
corresponding to digits in the native script of various
languages (“uno”, “dos”, “tres”, etc., for the CAPTCHA
challenge in Spanish), where the correct solution is the
sequence of Roman numerals corresponding to those
words (“1”, “2”, “3”, etc.) for any CAPTCHA in any lan-
guage. Ideally, such CAPTCHAs should be easy to grasp
and fast to solve by the language’s speakers, yet substan-
tially less likely to be solved by non-speakers or random
chance. We expect a measurably high accuracy for ser-
vices employing workers familiar with those languages.
Table 2 lists the languages we used in this experiment
along with an example three-digit CAPTCHA in the lan-
guage corresponding to the solution “123”. For broad
global coverage, we selected 21 languages based on a
combination of factors including global exposure (En-
14
glish), prevalence of world-wide native speakers (Chi-
nese, Spanish, English, Hindi, Arabic), regions of ex-
pected low-cost labor markets with inexpensive Inter-
net access (India, China, Southeast Asia, Latin America),
and developed regions unlikely to be sources of afford-
able CAPTCHA labor (e.g., Western Europe) and lastly
one synthetic language as a control (Klingon [15]).
The CAPTCHA we submitted had instructions in the
language for how to solve the CAPTCHA (e.g., “Por favor
escriba los n´umeros abajo” for Spanish), as well as an
initial word and Roman numeral as a concrete example
(“uno”, “1”). In our experiments, we randomly generated
222 unique CAPTCHAs in each language and submitted
them to the six services still operating in January 2010.
We rotated through languages such that we submitted a
CAPTCHA in this format once every 20–25 minutes. The
CAPTCHAs did not repeat digits to reduce the correlated
effect of a random guess. As a result, the actual proba-
bility for guessing a CAPTCHA is 1/504 (9 × 8 × 7, re-
duced by 1 due to the example), although workers un-
aware of the construction would still be making guesses
out of 1,000 possibilities.
Second, workers at a number of the services exhibit
strong afﬁnities to particular languages. Five of the ser-
vices have accuracies for Chinese (Traditional and Sim-
pliﬁed) either substantially higher or nearly as high as
English. The services evidently include a sizeable work-
force ﬂuent in Chinese, likely mainland China with avail-
able low-cost labor. In addition, Antigate has apprecia-
ble accuracies for Russian and Hindi, presumably draw-
ing on workforces in Russia and India. Similarly for
CaptchaBypass and Russian; BeatCaptcha and Tamil,
Portuguese, and Spanish; and DeCaptcher and Tamil.
Other non-trivial accuracies in Bengali and Tagalog sug-
gest further recruitment in India and southeast Asia. Ser-
vices with non-trivial accuracies in Portuguese, Spanish,
and Italian could be explained by a workforce familiar
with one language who can readily deduce similar words
in the other Romance languages. Consistent with these
observations, MR. E reported in our interview that they
Table 2 also shows the accuracy of the services when
presented with these CAPTCHAs. The accuracy corre-
sponds to a response with all three digits correct (since
we created them we have their ground truth). For a con-
venient ordering, we sort the languages by the average
accuracy across all services.
The results paint a revealing picture. First, although
Roman alphanumerics in typical CAPTCHAs are glob-
ally comprehensible—and therefore easily outsourced—
English words for numerals represent a noticeable se-
mantic gap for presumably non-English speakers. Very
high accuracies on normal CAPTCHAs drop to 38–62%
for the challenge presented in English.

draw from labor markets in China, India, Bangladesh,
and Vietnam.
Finally, the results for ImageToText are impressive.
Relative to the other services, ImageToText has appre-
ciable accuracy across a remarkable range of languages,
including languages where none of the other services
had few if any correct solutions (Dutch, Korean, Viet-
namese, Greek, Arabic) and even two correct solutions
of CAPTCHAs in Klingon. Either ImageToText recruits a
truly international workforce, or the workers were able to
identify the CAPTCHA construction and learn the correct
answers. ImageToText is the most expensive service by
a wide margin, but clearly has a dynamic and adaptive
labor pool.
Time Zone. As another approach for using CAPTCHAs
to reveal demographic information about workers—in
this case, their time zone—we translated the following
instruction into 14 of the languages as CAPTCHA im-
ages: “Enter the current time”. We sent these CAPTCHAs
to each of the six services at the same rate as the other
language CAPTCHAs with numbers. We received 15,775
responses, with the most common response being a re-
type of the instruction in the native language. Of the re-
maining responses, we received 1,583 (10.0%) with an
answer in a recognizable time format. Of those, 77.9%
of them came from UTC+8, further reinforcing the esti-
mation of a large labor pool from China; the two other
top time zones were the Indian UTC+5.5 with 5.7% and
Eastern Europe UTC+2 with 3.0%.
6.5 Adaptability
As a ﬁnal assessment, we wanted to examine how both
CAPTCHA services and solvers adapt to changes in state-
of-the-art CAPTCHA generation. We focused on the re-
cently proposed Asirra CAPTCHA [9], which is based
on identifying pictures of cats and dogs among a set of
12 images. Using the corpus of images provided by the
Asirra authors, we hand crafted our own version of the
