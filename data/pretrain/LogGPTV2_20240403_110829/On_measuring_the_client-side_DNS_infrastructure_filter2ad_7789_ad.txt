### DNS TTL Behavior Analysis

#### Introduction
In this analysis, we examine the Time to Live (TTL) values returned by various DNS actors, including Full DNS (FDNS), Recursive DNS (RDNS), and their underlying infrastructure. The focus is on how these actors handle TTL values, particularly in terms with incorrect or unexpected behavior.

#### Aggregate TTL Behavior
Table 3 summarizes the aggregate behavior of FDNSes and their underlying infrastructure in handling TTL values:

| Behavior                   | Percentage of Measurements |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Honest                     | 19%                        |
| Lie on Initial             | 38%                        |
| Lie on Subsequent          | 9%                         |
| Constant TTL               | 7%                         |
| Increment TTL              | 1%                         |

**Key Findings:**
- 19% of FDNSes and their infrastructure always report the correct TTL value.
- 38% of FDNSes return an incorrect TTL value for the initial request.
- 9% of FDNSes return an incorrect TTL value for subsequent requests.
- 7% of FDNSes return a constant TTL value without decrementing.
- 1% of FDNSes increment the TTL after it counts down to zero.

#### TTL Deviations
Table 4 provides a detailed view of the observed TTL deviations, including both initial and subsequent requests:

| Expected (sec) | % Mode Lie | Value | % of All Lies |
|----------------|------------|-------|---------------|
| 1              | 0%         | 10000 | 35%           |
| 10-120         | 11%        | 10000 | ≥ 37%         |
| 1000           | ≤ 1%       | 10000 | 62%           |
| 3600           | ≤ 8%       | 3600  | 51%           |
| 10000          | 1%         | 10000 | 40%           |
| 10800          | 2%         | 21600 | 27%           |
| 86400          | 5%         | 21600 | 36%           |
| 100000         | 8%         | 21600 | 27%           |
| 604800         | 16%        | 604800| 26%           |
| 1000000        | 22%        | 604800| 67%           |

**Observations:**
- 11% of FDNSes deviate from a 1-second authoritative TTL.
- 35% of the lies are for a TTL of 10,000 seconds.
- Most resolvers appear to cap the TTL at one week (604,800 seconds).
- The prevalence of lies increases for both small and large TTL values.

#### Record Lifetime in Caches
Figure 12 shows the length of time records remain in some cache within the resolving infrastructure for TTLs of 30 seconds and 1 million seconds. The "All" lines reflect the longest record lifetime observed, while the "Accessible" lines show results for FDNSes that remained accessible throughout the experiment.

**Key Findings:**
- 90% of FDNSes retain records with a TTL of 30 seconds for no longer than the TTL, with 60% retaining the record for the full 30 seconds.
- 10% of FDNSes retain the record for longer than the TTL, with 4% retaining the record for over 100 seconds.
- For records with a TTL of 1 million seconds, 40% are active for more than 1 hour.

#### FDNS TTL Behavior
Using the record injection technique, we study the behavior of 683K FDNSes in isolation. Table 5 summarizes the findings:

| Behavior                   | Percentage of Measurements |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Honest                     | 60%                        |
| Lie on Initial             | 12%                        |
| Lie on Subsequent          | 30%                        |
| Constant TTL               | 26%                        |
| Incrementing TTL           | 10%                        |

**Key Findings:**
- 60% of FDNSes never lie with respect to the TTL.
- 12% of FDNSes lie in response to the initial request.
- 30% of FDNSes lie in response to subsequent requests.
- 26% of FDNSes report a constant TTL value without decrementing.
- 10% of FDNSes begin to increment the TTL value upon decrementing it to zero.

#### RDNSi TTL Behavior
For RDNSies, we use the same experimental technique. Table 7 shows the general results, and Table 8 shows the TTL deviations:

| Behavior                   | Percentage of Measurements |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Honest                     | 2%                         |
| Lie on Initial             | 80%                        |
| Lie on Subsequent          | 18%                        |
| Constant TTL               | 0%                         |
| Incrementing TTL           | 0%                         |

**Key Findings:**
- 2% of RDNSies are consistently honest.
- 80% of RDNSies lie on the initial request.
- 18% of RDNSies lie on subsequent requests.
- RDNSies do not exhibit constant TTL or pathological TTL incrementing behavior.

#### Conclusion
This analysis highlights the significant variability in how different DNS actors handle TTL values. While many FDNSes and RDNSies generally follow the expected TTL behavior, a substantial number exhibit deviations, such as returning incorrect TTLs, constant TTLs, or even incrementing TTLs. These findings are crucial for understanding and improving DNS caching mechanisms and ensuring the integrity of DNS records.
