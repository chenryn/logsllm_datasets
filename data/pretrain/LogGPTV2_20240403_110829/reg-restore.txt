### `reg restore` Command

The `reg restore` command is used to write saved subkeys and entries back into the Windows Registry.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
reg restore <KeyName> <FileName>
```

#### Parameters
- **KeyName**: Specifies the full path of the subkey to be restored. The restore operation only works on the local computer. The key name must include a valid root key. Valid root keys for the local computer are: `HKLM`, `HKCU`, `HKCR`, `HKU`, and `HKCC`. If the registry key name contains a space, enclose the key name in double quotes.
- **FileName**: Specifies the name and path of the file containing the content to be written into the registry. This file must be created in advance using the `reg save` command and must have a `.hiv` extension.
- **/?**: Displays help information at the command prompt.

#### Remarks
- Before editing any registry entries, you should save the parent subkey using the `reg save` command. If the edit fails, you can then restore the original subkey using the `reg restore` operation.
- The return values for the `reg restore` operation are:
  - **0**: Success
  - **1**: Failure

#### Examples
To restore the file named `NTRKBkUp.hiv` into the key `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\ResKit` and overwrite the existing contents of the key, use the following command:
```plaintext
reg restore HKLM\Software\Microsoft\ResKit NTRKBkUp.hiv
```

This will restore the specified subkey from the backup file, replacing any existing data in the target key.
