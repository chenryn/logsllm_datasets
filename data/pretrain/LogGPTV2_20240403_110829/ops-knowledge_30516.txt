User:  web application is being used in a DDoS attack and you need to provide a mitigation.
Assistant: Here are some measures to mitigate DDoS attacks: 1. Increase bandwidth: Increasing your website's bandwidth can help handle more requests, thereby reducing the risk of service crashes. 2. Limit traffic: Use firewalls, routers, or other network devices to limit malicious traffic from entering the system. 3. Use a CDN: A content delivery network (CDN) can distribute requests so that different servers handle different requests, thereby reducing the risk of overloading a single server. 4. Advanced load balancing: Using a load balancer can distribute traffic to multiple servers, thereby reducing the pressure on a single server. 5. Block IP address: Blocking the IP address of the attack source can contain the attack and reduce the access of malicious traffic, thereby reducing the risk of the system being attacked.
