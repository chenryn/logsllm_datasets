## 1. What is Spyware?
### Definition
Spyware is a type of malicious software that users often install unintentionally while installing other software. There are two main types of spyware:
- **Commercial Purpose**: Tracks user browsing habits to serve targeted ads (e.g., Adware, Browser Hijackers).
- **Invasive Purpose**: Designed by hackers to collect private data or penetrate computer systems (e.g., Trojan Horses, Backdoors, Key-loggers, Rootkits).

## 2. Virus vs. Spyware
| **Virus** | **Spyware** |
|-----------|-------------|
| Active and large-scale attacks | Passive, small-scale, and stealthy |
| Low mutation | High mutation, customizable |
| No specific target | Specific targets, localized |
| Causes destruction | Collects information |

## 3. The Malicious Behavior Models of Spyware
### Traditional vs. Modern Spyware Behavior
- **Traditional Spyware**: Exists as independent executable programs.
- **Modern Spyware**: Can appear in various forms such as EXE, DLL, SYS, and Shellcode.

### Case Study: DLL Injection
- **Description**: A type of spyware that injects a DLL into `Explorer.exe` and Internet Explorer.
- **Behavior**:
  1. Drops the spyware (`comph.dll`).
  2. Injects the DLL into `Explorer.exe`.
  3. Creates an invisible Internet Explorer process.
  4. Injects the DLL into Internet Explorer.

### Common Malicious Behavior Model
- **Deployment Unit**: Handles initial installation and setup.
- **Launch Unit**: Triggers the spyware's activation.
- **Core Unit**: Performs the malicious actions (data collection, remote control, self-protection, etc.).

## 4. Strategy of Spyware Analysis and Detection
### Types of Spyware Detection
- **Before Execution**: Static Analysis (Signature Detection, Integrity Monitor)
- **On Execution**: Behavior Monitoring (Anti-Virus, HIPS, Integrity Check)
- **After Execution**: Cross-View Check (Forensic Tools, Scanners)

## 5. Spyware Detection - Archon Scanner
