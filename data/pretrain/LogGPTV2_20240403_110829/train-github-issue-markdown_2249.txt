### Version
2.5.21
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/365deb40/
### Steps to reproduce
Click the app container to toggle whether the two colored containers are shown
or not
### What is expected?
Transitions for both elements (rotating and fading)
### What is actually happening?
Only the parent (primary / fade) transition is showing

Try removing the first transition and the v-if attribute of the parent
element, to see that the second transition is working fine on its own.
