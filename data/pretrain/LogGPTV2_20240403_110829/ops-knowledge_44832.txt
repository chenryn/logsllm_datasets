Question: "A network administrator is considering the implications of the OSI model's layering for managing a large network. Which statements accurately reflect the consequences of this layered structure on network management?"
 "A": "Layering restricts a network administrator from monitoring network traffic at different levels of abstraction."

 "C": "Network management is complicated by the layered structure as it requires administrators to have expertise in only one specific layer."
 "D": "The abstraction between layers aids in network scalability, as expanding the network does not require reconfiguration of existing protocols."
