Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of running tasks 11-19 in stage 27. It also shows that the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task were recorded, and that the results of each task were sent to the driver. Additionally, it shows that the system found blocks rdd_42_15-19 locally.
