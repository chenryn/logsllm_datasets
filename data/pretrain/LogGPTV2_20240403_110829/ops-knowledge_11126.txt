User: In an Internet company, if there is a problem with the performance of a microservice component, how to optimize the performance? Please propose possible optimization measures from the code level and architecture level.
Assistant: 1. Optimization measures at the code level: 1. Cache usage: Use cache to reduce database and disk I/O and improve read speed. 2. Avoid double calculation: avoid double calculation, use cache to reduce calculation and reduce network load. 3. Optimize SQL statements: use indexes for keywords, constants, and columns, avoid JOIN operations on large tables, standardize size limits, reject fuzzy queries using LIKE '%', try to replace HAVING clauses with WHERE clauses, etc. 4. Standardize code: reduce invalid code, reduce the number of code layers as much as possible, reduce code duplication, streamline the amount of code, etc. 5. Use asynchronous programming: Using asynchronous programming can reduce thread switching time and improve performance. 6. Avoid memory leaks: When using collection classes, empty unnecessary objects in time to avoid memory leaks. 7. Reduce GC: Do not use frequent creation and release of objects, and use object pools and other methods to reuse as much as possible. 2. Optimization measures at the architectural level: 1. Split services: split services according to business, and perform different optimizations according to different services. 2. Achieve horizontal expansion: use load balancing, distributed cache, distributed database and other solutions to achieve horizontal expansion and load balancing. 3. Realize vertical expansion: realize vertical expansion by increasing the computing power of the machine, increasing memory, etc. 4. Introduce message queues: Use message queues to reduce coupling between services and improve system scalability. 5. Data sharding: For large-scale data storage systems, data can be stored on different data nodes through data sharding to improve data read and write speed. 6. Realize asynchronous loading of data: For requests that need to load a large amount of data, the response speed can be improved through asynchronous loading. 7. Adjust the cache strategy: According to business needs, adjust the cache usage strategy to improve system performance.
