Special asymmetry property of Pythagorean Means:
Asymmetric growth (or decay) rates of harmonic mean compared
to the symmetric growth (or decay) of arithmetic mean under
various attacks, is another reason which helps to infer the pres-
ence and type of falsi(cid:27)cation precisely, quickly, and with high
sensitivity. With this attack context information, it is possible
to estimate the true consensus accurately. When a subset of pi
values in pmix are increased/decreased (with a false bias δ ), the
AM value grows or decays linearly. On the contrary, the behavior
of H M is inherently di(cid:29)erent and can be summarized as follows:
Property (1) : We observe that HM grows slower and decays faster
than corresponding AM, when sub-portions of a data set gen-
erated from multiple sources experience additive and deductive
manipulation, respectively.
Property (2) : Growth and decay rates of HM under the same δ
is unequal when used for additive and deductive attacks, unlike
AM which show equal rates. In HM, decay rate is larger than its
growth rate induced by the same δ .
Property (3) : We observed that growth and decay rates of HM
compared to AM and the e(cid:29)ects on the proposed ratio metric also
depend on (a) whether the datapoint being biased are on the lesser
(left) or greater (right) than the actual arithmetic mean, and (b)
the magnitude of δ .
The above properties can be mathematically illustrated by the
following: Consider a sorted series with two numbers U = (u1,u2)
such that its mean and standard deviation is (AM,σ ). In Fig. 7, the
x-axis represents the variable u1. Let us (cid:27)x the u2 as constant such
that u2 = {2} is a singleton set, while u1 is a set such that u1 ∈ R+.

Figure 7: Growth Decay Rates of HM and AM
Hence, the cartesian product of u1 and u2 is the set U = u1×u2,
whose elements are a two tuple dataset. In Fig. 7, let the y-axis
represent the value of AM (u1,u2) or H M (u1,u2) for every possi-
ble element in the set U . Given any element say U = (1, 2), visu-
alize increasing/decreasing value of u1 as mimicking additive or
deductive biases to U = (1, 2), that changes both the AM (u1,u2)
or H M (u1,u2). In Fig. 7, AM function of (u1, 2) ∀ u1 ∈ (0,∞]
(represented by the solid blue line) shows a linear growth with in-
creasing u1, and is neither strictly concave or convex. On the other
hand, the HM function of (u1, 2) ∀ u1 ∈ (0,∞] (represented by
a dashed red line) is a strictly Schur-Concave Function [32]. This
di(cid:29)erence in concavity is the theoretical basis that trigger changes
in the proposed ratio metric under various attack types and is il-
lustrated below using the same example.
Illustration of Properties: For dataset U = (1, 2), let the AM =
1.5 and H M = 1.33 be represented by points A and H as marked in
Fig. 7. Hence, their ratio value say Qr at io = H M
AM
= 0.88.
Suppose in U = (1, 2), u1 = 1 is biased with deduction of δ = 0.3,
such that U − = (0.7, 2). Points a− = 1.35 and h− = 1.037 corre-
spond to the biased arithmetic and harmonic means respectively.
Thus, decay in HM and AM are ∆H M− = h− − H = −0.293
and ∆AM− = a− − A = −0.15. Ignoring the signs which sig-
nify decay, |∆H M−| > |∆AM−|, proving that HM decays faster
than AM. Note that the biased ratio of HM to AM in this case
is Q− = 0.76  0.88 = Qr at io . Since |0.76 − 0.88| > |0.95 − 0.88|, it

proves Property 2. While, we may be temped to believe that addi-
tive attacks increase ratio while deductive attacks decrease them,
this is not true. Consider an additive bias value of δ = 3.5 instead,
that is added to data-point u1 = 1. The resultant ratio in this case is
Q +
= 0.82, which is a decrease from the original ratio 0.88. There-
fore, the fact that magnitude of δ , plays a role in the observed rise
or drop in the ratio is established. Finally, suppose the δ = 0.3 were
added to u2 instead of u1. Note that in U = (1, 2), the data-point
u2 = 2, is on the greater than (right side) of the true mean of U

Therefore, observing Qr at io
where ϵ is a threshold parameter such that ϵ ∈ (0, 3σr at io ]. The
choice of ϵ controls whether the consensus correction step will be
invoked or not. The appropriate ϵ can be learned by studying the
trade-o(cid:29) between ϵ and classi(cid:27)cation error rate, over various δav❕
and ρmal combinations as shown later in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b). Note
that, the required sensitivity of ϵ to attacks need not to be very
precise, since the purpose of Eqn. 4 is to only catch evidence of
orchestrated attacks, that disturb the consensus signi(cid:27)cantly and
therefore need the consensus correction. In contrast, isolated or
smaller scale attacks (with low δav❕/ρmal ) do not drastically devi-
ate the ratio metric and thus may not get detected under the given
ϵ. However, at the same time such small scale attacks will also not
a(cid:29)ect the consensus in a way that causes large classi(cid:27)cation errors.
av❕ (F ) over time is enough to conclude
whether an orchestrated falsi(cid:27)cation is happening. If Qr at io
av❕ (F )
has decreased (or increased) more than ϵ, than the previous frame
Qr at io
av❕ (F − 1), it is an evidence of the start of an orchestrated fal-
si(cid:27)cation. Let this frame be marked as Ft r i❕, such that Ft r i❕ − 1 is
the last frame with a normal ratio value.
Now, after a period of sustained drop (or rise) in the ratio metric
outside the ϵ, an increasing (or decreasing) Qr at io
av❕ (F ) may indicate
that attacks are now ceasing. As seen in Fig. 8, the ratio increases
(decreases) back to the normal range Qr at io (Ft r i❕ − 1)±ϵ value on
the 72nd day, when our implemented attack was stopped on the
68-th day. Note that, isolated attacks from individual customers,
may not have a drastic e(cid:29)ect on the ratio margin (±ϵ), and these
attacks are countered by the trust model discussed later. This is a
very simple but very powerful technique to di(cid:29)erentiate between
legitimate changes due to environment and false data injections.
Semi-Supervised Version of Detection Criterion: One disadvantage
of the unsupervised detection criterion (Eqn. 4), is that it may miss
incremental attacks where δav❕ slowly increases over time, such
that the drop of ratio compared to the previous time window will
be within the ϵ. However, if enough historical (attack free) data
is available (e.g. the Texas Dataset), the historical normal range
Qr at io
av❕ (F hist ) ± ϵ of the ratio can be learned easily given its stable
nature. In such as case, even with incremental attacks, the ratio
metric will eventually cross the learned stable historical range.
