Question: When developing an iOS application in Swift, a developer is considering the implications of data mutability on security for storing confidential user information. Which of the following statements correctly addresses the handling of such data to minimize security risks?
"A": "Using 'NSData' or 'let' keyword ensures that the data is immutable and can be easily removed from memory.",
"B": "Storing data as mutable using 'NSMutableData' increases security by allowing the data to be overwritten when no longer needed.",
"C": "Immutable data types like 'NSData' or those declared with the 'let' keyword in Swift cannot be easily removed from memory.",
"D": "Confidential information should be stored with Codable protocol and JSON encoding to ensure automatic data immutability."
Answer: C
