User: When I execute jupyter notebook in my virtual environment in Arch Linux, the following error occurred.
Error executing Jupyter command 'notebook': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
My Python version is 3.6, and my Jupyter version is 4.3.0
How can I resolve this issue?
Assistant: For me the issue was that the command jupyter notebook changed to jupyter-notebook after installation.
If that doesn't work, try python -m notebook, and if it opens, close it, then
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/, then refresh your path by opening a new terminal, and try jupyter notebook again. 
And finally, if that doesn't work, take a look at vim /usr/local/bin/jupyter-notebook, vim /usr/local/bin/jupyter, vim /usr/local/bin/jupyter-lab (if you have JupyterLab) and edit the #!python version at the top of the file to match the version of python you are trying to use. As an example, I installed Python 3.8.2 on my mac, but those files still had the path to the 3.6 version, so I edited it to #!/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/python3
