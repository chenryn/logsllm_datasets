Excludes 6.2% of biz domains without a corresponding com namesake. Darker bands indicate
higher conﬁdence.
Defensive registrations prevent another party from misrepresenting itself as the reg-
istrant or from simply capturing trafﬁc (intended for the registrant) for advertising pur-
poses. A defensively registered domain is one not used by the registrant to name and
identify products, services, or network infrastructure.3
Although it is nearly impossible to divine the registrant’s intention with absolute
certainty, certain network-visible characteristics of a domain serve as indicators of pri-
mary or defensive use. In particular, we consider domain ownership, Web content, and
hosting infrastructure sharing as indicators of primary or secondary use. Our results are
summarized in Figure 1.
4.1 Parked Domains
A parked domain is not actively used by the registrant, and does not represent a name or
brand used by the registrant. Registrants typically hold parked domains with the inten-
tion of selling them at a proﬁt or monetizing accidental Web trafﬁc through advertising.
Parked domains are easily identiﬁed by prominent advertising on the domain’s site that
one may purchase the domain and usually includes additional advertising.
We rely on the Web content hosted at the domain as our primary indicator of a parked
domain. Table 1 shows the proportion of parked sites in the biz and com gTLDs. Fig-
ure 1 shows the number of parked biz domains (23.6%) having a com namesake.
4.2 Identical Web Content
Owners of defensively registered domains frequently reroute all Web trafﬁc to the
intended (primary) domain, usually via HTTP redirection [4]. Because the browser
3 The difference between a defensive registration and either cybersquatting or typosquatting
(registering misspellings of popular brands) lies in the identity of the registrant: when the
registrant also owns the intended brand name or trademark, the registration is defensive; when
the registrant is a third party with no legitimate claim to the name, the registration constitutes
cybersquatting or typosquatting.

actively follows HTTP redirects, this method has the advantage of changing the user-
visible address bar to reﬂect the new address (the target of the redirect). The user thus
sees the correct address, consistent with the branding of the site.
Table 1 includes statistics about this mechanism: 18.5% of biz and 17.3% of com
domains host a Web server that redirects the user. However, 4.1% of biz sites redirect
to a site hosted at the same domain name in a different TLD, compared to 0.4% for com.
We also see defensive registrations where both the biz and com Web servers redirect a
user to the same third domain. In our set of domains in both biz and com, 6.1% have
identical redirects.
Despite the effectiveness of HTTP redirects and their advantage of “correcting” the
user, site operators also may simply maintain identical Web sites under both domains.
To detect this condition, we compared the content of each biz site to that of its com
namesake. Upon examination, we found that 3.0% of non-parked sites did indeed serve
the same content. We only classify pages as identical if the source matches exactly,
meaning a match almost certainly indicates a defensive registration, but a mismatch
only weakly indicates a primary one.
As shown in the dark red portion of Figure 1, 12.8% of biz–com domains have
identical web content or redirects, a strong indicator of a defensive registration. 12.9%
of biz–com domains have different web content and no stronger classiﬁers, and so are
weakly classiﬁed as primary registrations.
4.3 Common Registrant
The identity of the registrant provides another classiﬁcation feature. One registrant
owning both a biz domain as well as its com namesake likely suggests defensive
228

registration. To identify such cases, we extracted registrant information from publicly
available Whois records, as described in Section 3.2.
We could retrieve and successfully parse both Whois records for 65% of all biz–
com pairs.4 Of these 65%, 10.1% of biz domains and 9.3% of com domains showed
some manner of “privacy protection” mechanism, blocking the registrant information
from appearing in the Whois record and leaving 50.6% of all biz–com pairs that could
potentially match.
We grouped these pairs into three categories based on the degree to which we be-
lieved we identiﬁed the same registrants: weak matches, strong matches, and no match.
Using the methodology described in Section 3.2, we determine 5.9% of pairs a strong
match, another 15.6% a weak match, and 29.1% unlikely to be the same registrant. (Put
another way, we found at least some degree of a match for around 40% of the pairs we
could assess.)
As shown in Figure 1, we consider whois data to be more reliable than common
hosting or different web content, since either of those may be incidental. We consider it
to be less reliable than HTTP redirects and identical web content, since those are strong
indicators of a defensive registration. After using stronger indicators, we classify 11.6%
of biz domains as defensive based on whois and A record data (see Section 4.4) and
22.8% as likely primary.
4.4 Shared Infrastructure
We also used DNS crawling to observe infrastructure sharing between a biz domain
and its com counterpart. In particular, we used CNAMEs and common A records as
evidence of defensive registrations.
We identify a CNAME match in two different cases: ﬁrst, when domains in both biz
and com have CNAMEs pointing to the same domain; second, when the domain in biz
has a CNAME pointing to its com namesake, or vice versa. Of the 2 million domains
in both biz and com, 32,431 (1.6%) show common CNAMEs, which demonstrates a
clear relationship between the two domains. We include these in the “redirect match”
category in Figure 1.
We see many more domains with common A records. Our crawler observed com-
mon A records in 439,890 domains (22%) between biz and their com counterparts. We
see three plausible explanations for such sharing: ﬁrst, defensive registrations; second,
coincidental common hosting, with unrelated owners of the biz and com employing
common hosting infrastructure; third and ﬁnally, parking the biz and com domains in
the same domain parking infrastructure. Since we classify parked domains ﬁrst and only
distinguish between primary and defensive registrations after considering all parked do-
mains, we can ignore the third case.
While common A records do suggest a defensive registration, we cannot reliably
distinguish true sharing and common hosting. Because of this, we consider common A
records weak evidence of a defensive registration.
4 The delegated nature of the com Whois system means that these 65% necessarily constitute a
biased sample, because being able to retrieve and parse a given Whois record depends on the
registrar, speciﬁcally on their query rate limitations and record formatting.

5 Discussion
Our analysis ﬁnds 22.8% of biz domains parked with a known parking service. We
can with certainty classify another 12.8% of biz domains as defensive registrations,
leaving two thirds undetermined. At least 27.7% of these served some kind of content
(excluding cases where this content proved identical to the com namesake). In addition,
of the pairs for which we could assess non-private registrant information, we found at
least a degree of match between the biz and com registration in 40% of the instances
(§ 4.3), indicating a substantial level of registrations likely made defensively.
To get at the fundamental value (to registrants) of the biz TLD, we can approach the
question from the other direction: how many biz domains do registrants use actively?
We assessed the popularity of biz domains in the Alexa [1] Web site rankings, as well
as the popularity of biz domains in the Open Directory Project [9]. We show the results
in Table 3, along with other common TLDs.
Table 3. TLD frequency in the Alexa listings and the Open Directory Project. In the
Alexa 1,000,000, biz ranks (in frequency of occurrence) between com.cn and ir, while in the
ODP, it falls between cat and za. Only one biz domain, livedoor.biz (a blogging site), re-
sides in the Alexa 500.

The biz TLD occurs 140 times less frequently than com in the Alexa 1 million,
323 times less frequently in the Alexa 500 (based on 1 occurrence), and 218 times less
frequently in the Open Directory Project. Note that the com zone is about 46 times
larger than biz. Although not a formal assessment of usage, these statistics suggest a
disproportionally lower popularity of biz compared to com.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we examined the current state of the biz TLD on its ten-year anniversary.
We found that in many respects, most notably in the prevalence of domain speculation
(parking), biz resembles com. And while one could conclude that it has failed to rival
com, biz did extract defensive registrations from existing domain owners. Although
registering these domains costs no more than $10 each, this cost is dwarfed by the
additional costs of defending trademarks (via resolution procedures and litigation) in a
new TLD.

On the eve of a bold new initiative by ICANN to open TLD registration to the general
public, biz provides a valuable lesson in the costs and beneﬁts associated with expand-
ing the DNS name space. In particular, we anticipate a level of defensive registrations
that, in aggregate, will reﬂect signiﬁcant imposed expenditures.
