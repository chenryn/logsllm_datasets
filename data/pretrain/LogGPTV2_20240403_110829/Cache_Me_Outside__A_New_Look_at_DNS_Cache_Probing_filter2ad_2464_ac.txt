Statista reported that around 3.5 billion people have smartphones in
2020 [33]. Mobile devices are generally acknowledged to contain a vast trea-
sure trove of information about their owners. Identifying widely used stalker-
ware tools can help focus advocacy eﬀorts on speciﬁc companies and speciﬁc
geographic areas, and highlight the scale of the stalkerware problem.
Previous work have studied how stalkerware is used in IPS [16,32,35] and
highlighted that while these apps often are marketed for ostensibly legal pur-
poses, they can be easily employed for abusive ones [10]. One recent work esti-
mated the prevalence of stalkerware apps on four shared DNS resolver services
in the US, though none have done so globally.
We ﬁrst obtained a set of domain names associated with the network activ-
ity of 46 stalkerware apps [34]. We ﬁltered out domain names that appear to
host the stalkerware company’s website, as these are likely to experience DNS
lookups unrelated to stalkerware activity, and obtained a ﬁnal list of domains
representing 22 apps. We used dmap to perform a one-week measurement look-
ing for cache hits on these stalkerware domain names. Similar to the Netsweeper

study in Sect. 4.1, if there were cache hits at a backend resolver for a stalker-
ware domain during at least six out of the seven days of our measurement, we
hypothesize that a user behind that backend resolver has the stalkerware app
installed.
Global Proliferation. Our cache probing found stalkerware activity on back-
ends in 432 ASNs and in 79 countries. The top-ﬁve stalkerware apps are shown in
Table 4 based on their activity in the most number of countries. The complete
results can be found in Appendix A. The Cocospy app is the most prevalent
stalkerware app found in 71 countries, 239 ASNs, and 889 backend resolvers. We
have also listed the top-three countries for each of the apps that had the most
number of backends showing stalkerware activity. For instance, the Cocospy app
is observed from 200 backend resolvers in the US. We can observe that the United
States and Brazil are always among the top-three countries. Figure 1 presents the
number of stalkerware applications we see across the world. The United States
(21), Brazil (19) and Germany (18), Great Britain (17), and Russia (16) are the
top-ﬁve countries with the most number of active stalkerware apps.

Regionality of the Apps. We observe a direct relationship between the lan-
guage of these stalkerware apps and the region where we see the app being most
active according to our measurements. For instance, two stalkerware apps, “Rep-
ticulus” and “Talklog” are both Russian products and are mostly seen in back-
ends in Russia and Ukraine. Further, “Espiao Android” and “Meuspy” which
are mostly active in Brazil, are primarily available in the Portuguese language.
Although a public ground truth dataset about stalkerware prevalence does not
exist, this ﬁnding validates our measurements to some extent.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we revisit DNS cache probing and show that DNS forwarders can
enable DNS cache probing, even in light of resolvers only responding to local
clients. We leverage these DNS forwarders to probe DNS resolver caches that
were otherwise not feasible. We then develop a formulation that allows us to
infer the number of network devices behind a given DNS serve and validate this
technique via controlled experiments. Further, we present two case studies, (1)
we localize Netsweeper devices based on a daemon available on these devices
that attempts to download updated versions of URL categorization list from
Netsweeper’s update domain, and (2) we study the global proliferation of stalk-
erware using their known indicators. In ongoing work, we are examining how our
method can be applied to other applications that perform DNS queries.
