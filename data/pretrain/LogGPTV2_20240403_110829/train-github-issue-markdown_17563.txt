> Issue originally reported by @danez in babel/babylon#78
According to the spec when defining multiple variables with the same name, the
parser should throw and SyntaxError when using `let` or `const`:
`let foo, foo;`  
or  
`let foo; let foo;`
From 13.2.1.1:
> It is a Syntax Error if the BoundNames of BindingList contains any duplicate
> entries.
V8 trows an error for `let` and `const`, but not vor `var`.
