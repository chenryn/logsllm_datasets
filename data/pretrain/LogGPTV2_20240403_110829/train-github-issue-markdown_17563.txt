### Issue Originally Reported by @danez in babel/babylon#78

According to the ECMAScript specification, when defining multiple variables with the same name using `let` or `const`, the parser should throw a `SyntaxError`. For example:

```javascript
let foo, foo;
```

or

```javascript
let foo; let foo;
```

The relevant section of the specification (13.2.1.1) states:

> It is a Syntax Error if the BoundNames of BindingList contains any duplicate entries.

V8 correctly throws an error for `let` and `const` in these cases, but not for `var`.

This behavior aligns with the spec for `let` and `const`, but differs for `var`, which does not trigger a syntax error even if the variable names are duplicated.
