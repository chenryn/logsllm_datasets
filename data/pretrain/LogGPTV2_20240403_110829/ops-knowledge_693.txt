User: I'm running App Engine with Python 2.7 on OS X. Once I stop the development server all data in the data store is lost. Same thing happens when I try to deploy my app. What might cause this behaviour and how to fix it?
Assistant: This is answered, but to explain a little further - the local datastore, by default writes to the temporary file system on your computer. By default, the temporary file is emptied any time you restart the computer, hence your datastore is emptied. If you don't restart your computer, your datastore should remain.
