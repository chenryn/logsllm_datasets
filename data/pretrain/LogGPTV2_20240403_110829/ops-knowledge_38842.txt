User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Squid service starts and stops forever so i have a server with Ubuntu 16.04. There runs a Squid ( Squid Cache: Version 3.5.12 ). It should function as forward proxy, authenticating the user then leading him/her forward to a peer. 

But Squid just starts then stops after like 20sec and then starts again.

I have no idea why. I red in other forums that you have to delete the cache and rebuild it but that did not help.

squid.conf passes the squid -k reconfigure so iam pretty sure its not in the config.

I hope somebody could help me to fix that.

thanks for you time.

EDIT: Not sure if it helps. In the short period the squid is active, it works fine. So I can connect and authenticate and get to the internet. 

EDIT 2 : 
Last lines from cache.log

Edit 3:  Update.
Thanks to you and a lot of trying i could pin the problem down. Squid only starting and stopping and so on if i put in the second cache_peer. Without that it works fine.

Assistant: Solved:
So as i wrote that one cache_peer was troublesome and if active, squid would restart over and over again. I saw in the logs that it wanted a netdb from that cache_peer. So i added no-netdb-exchange to the options from the cache_peer in the etc/squid/squid.conf.  Now it serves as wanted and doesn’t restart over and over any more.
Thank you all for helping and your time.
