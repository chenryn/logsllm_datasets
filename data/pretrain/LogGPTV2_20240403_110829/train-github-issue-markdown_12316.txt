When hitting various breakpoints in a complicated program, it might be helpful
for the stack frame area of the debug viewlet to highlight / animate in a
tasteful fashion the stack frame delta.
e.g.
Before stack  
fileA:35  
fileB:40  
fileC:50
-> steps into or continues
After stack  
fileA:29  
fileA:35  
fileB:40  
fileC:50
Would be nice if fileA:29 would be briefly and tastefully highlighted.
