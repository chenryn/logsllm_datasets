The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Notification time out: <*> 和 Connection broken for id <*>, my id = <*>, error =
B: Send worker leaving thread 和 Connection broken for id <*>, my id = <*>, error =
C: Received connection request /<*>:<*> 和 Interrupting SendWorker
D: Cannot open channel to <*> at election address /<*>:<*> 和 ******* GOODBYE /<*>:<*> ********

Assistant: Answer: D

Explanation: The log includes the fixed template fragments "Cannot open channel to <> at election address /<>:<>" and "****** GOODBYE /<>:<> ********," both of which appear in option D. Meanwhile, the template fragments in the other options do not match the content in the log. Therefore, option D is the most consistent with the log template.
