Authloop uses a codec agnostic modem and a TLS-
inspired protocol to perform authentication solely over
the audio channel. While Authloop provides end-to-end
authentication for heterogeneous phone calls, it has a
number of limitations compared to AuthentiCall. The
constrained bandwidth of the audio channel means
that
the handshakes are slow (requiring 9 seconds
on average), authentication is one-sided, and content
authentication is not possible. While Authloop can
prevent some forms of man-in-the-middle attacks,
it
is vulnerable to attacks that replace content. Finally,
because Authloop relies on the audio channel, users
must answer all calls before they can be authenticated.
AuthentiCall overcomes all of these limitations.
10 Conclusion
Telephone networks fail to provide even the most basic
guarantees about identity. AuthentiCall protects voice
calls made over traditional telephone networks by lever-
aging now-common data connections available to call
endpoints. AuthentiCall cryptographically authenticates
both call parties while only adding a worst case 1.4
seconds of overhead to the call setup time. Unlike other
solutions that use voice calls, AuthentiCall also protects
the content of the voice call with high accuracy. In so
doing, AuthentiCall offers a solution to the constant
onslaught of illicit or fraudulent bulk calls plaguing the
telephone network.
