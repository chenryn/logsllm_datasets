**Abstract:**

As web services like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo have become integral to daily internet use, cybercriminals have adapted their monetization strategies to target these platforms. This has led to the proliferation of fraudulent accounts, which are used to disseminate scams, phishing, and malware. Recent studies estimate that at least 3% of active Twitter accounts are fraudulent, while Facebook estimates its fraudulent account population at 1.5% of its active user base. The complexities of bypassing registration barriers such as CAPTCHAs, email confirmation, and IP blacklists have given rise to an underground market specializing in the bulk sale of fraudulent accounts.

In this paper, we investigate the underground market for fraudulent Twitter accounts to understand its operations, impact on Twitter spam levels, and methods used by merchants to circumvent automated registration barriers. We identified and monitored 27 account merchants who advertise via web storefronts, blackhat forums, and freelance labor sites. With Twitter's permission, we conducted a 10-month longitudinal study, purchasing a total of 121,027 fraudulent Twitter accounts on a bi-weekly basis from June 2012 to April 2013. Our findings show that merchants are adept at evading Twitter's existing defenses, generating thousands of accounts with minimal disruption.

To fulfill orders for fraudulent Twitter accounts, merchants rely on CAPTCHA solving services, fraudulent email credentials from Hotmail, Yahoo, and mail.ru, and a diverse pool of IP addresses from tens of thousands of hosts globally. These pre-aged accounts, stockpiled months in advance, have become a selling point in the underground market. We identify which registration barriers effectively increase the price of accounts and provide recommendations for improving existing automation barriers to increase the cost of fraudulent credentials.

To estimate the overall impact of the underground market on Twitter spam, we developed a classifier to retroactively detect several million fraudulent accounts generated and sold via the market. During active months, the 27 merchants we monitored were responsible for registering 10-20% of all accounts later flagged as spam, generating an estimated revenue of $127,000-$459,000. With Twitter's cooperation, we disabled 95% of the fraudulent accounts registered by the merchants we tracked, including those previously sold but not yet suspended for spamming.

**Contributions:**
- A 10-month longitudinal study of 27 merchants profiting from the sale of Twitter accounts.
- Development of a classifier based on registration signals that detects several million fraudulent accounts, generating $127,000-$459,000 in revenue.
- Investigation of the impact of the underground market on Twitter spam levels, finding that 10-20% of all spam accounts originate from the studied merchants.
- Analysis of the failures of existing automated registration barriers and provision of recommendations to increase the cost of generating fraudulent accounts.

**Background:**

Fraudulent accounts are part of a broader ecosystem of digital criminal goods and services available in the underground market. Previous investigations into this market have highlighted the role of account abuse and existing strategies for detecting spam and abuse. To conduct our investigation, we adhered to strict legal and ethical guidelines set by our institutions and Twitter.

**Underground Market:**

The underground market connects internet miscreants with sellers of specialized products and services, including spam hosting, CAPTCHA solving services, pay-per-install hosts, and exploit kits. Specialization within this ecosystem is common, with organized criminal communities focusing on various activities. Account merchants enable other miscreants to penetrate walled garden services, abstracting away the complexities of CAPTCHA solving, acquiring unique emails, and dodging IP blacklisting. These accounts can be used for a variety of profitable activities, such as spamming, phishing, and malware distribution.

**Spam Detection Strategies:**

Various detection strategies have been developed to combat spam in social networks, including analyzing social graph properties, characterizing post arrival rates, and detecting spam URLs. However, these approaches often delay detection until an attack is underway, potentially exposing legitimate users to spam. Overcoming these shortcomings requires at-registration abuse detection to flag fraudulent accounts during the registration process.

**Ethical Considerations:**

Our study involved infiltrating the market for fraudulent Twitter credentials, interacting with account merchants, and potentially galvanizing the abuse of Twitter. We did so with the intent of understanding how sellers register accounts and disrupting their future efforts. Prior to conducting our study, we worked with Twitter and our institutions to establish guidelines for interacting with merchants.

**Marketplace for Twitter Accounts:**

We infiltrated the market for Twitter accounts to understand its organization, pricing structure, and the availability of accounts over time. We identified 27 account merchants, purchasing from them on a bi-weekly basis from June 2012 to April 2013. Merchants can provide thousands of accounts within 24 hours at a price of $0.02-$0.10 per account.

**Identifying Merchants:**

With no central operation of the underground market, we investigated common haunts such as search engine advertisements, blackhat forums, and freelance labor pages. We identified 27 merchants, 10 of whom operate their own websites, 5 solicit via blackhat forums, and 12 advertise via freelance sites. Advertisements range from basic accounts to "pre-aged" accounts with unique biographies and profile data. We provide a detailed breakdown of the merchants and their solicitation sources in Table 1.

**Purchasing from Merchants:**

Once we identified a merchant, we placed an initial test purchase to determine the authenticity of the accounts being sold. If genuine, we then determined whether to repeatedly purchase from the merchant based on the quality of accounts provided and the overall impact on Twitter spam. Our purchasing was an iterative process, with each new set of accounts improving our understanding of the market. We placed 144 orders, totaling 120,019 accounts, and protected our identity using multiple email and Skype pseudonyms, conducting payments through PayPal, WebMoney, and prepaid credit cards.
