Abstract
As web services such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, and
Yahoo now dominate the daily activities of Internet users,
cyber criminals have adapted their monetization strate-
gies to engage users within these walled gardens. To fa-
cilitate access to these sites, an underground market has
emerged where fraudulent accounts – automatically gen-
erated credentials used to perpetrate scams, phishing, and
malware – are sold in bulk by the thousands. In order
to understand this shadowy economy, we investigate the
market for fraudulent Twitter accounts to monitor prices,
availability, and fraud perpetrated by 27 merchants over
the course of a 10-month period. We use our insights
to develop a classiﬁer to retroactively detect several mil-
lion fraudulent accounts sold via this marketplace, 95%
of which we disable with Twitter’s help. During active
months, the 27 merchants we monitor appeared respon-
sible for registering 10–20% of all accounts later ﬂagged
for spam by Twitter, generating $127–459K for their ef-
forts.

Introduction
As web services such as Twitter, Facebook, Google,
and Yahoo now dominate the daily activities of Inter-
net users [1], cyber criminals have adapted their mon-
etization strategies to engage users within these walled
gardens. This has lead to a proliferation of fraudulent
accounts – automatically generated credentials used to
disseminate scams, phishing, and malware. Recent stud-
ies from 2011 estimate at least 3% of active Twitter ac-
counts are fraudulent [29]. Facebook estimates its own
fraudulent account population at 1.5% of its active user
base [13], and the problem extends to major web services
beyond just social networks [14].
The complexities required to circumvent registration
barriers such as CAPTCHAs, email conﬁrmation, and IP
blacklists have lead to the emergence of an underground
market that specializes in selling fraudulent accounts in
bulk. Account merchants operating in this space brazenly
advertise: a simple search query for “buy twitter ac-
counts” yields a multitude of offers for fraudulent Twitter
credentials with prices ranging from $10–200 per thou-
sand. Once purchased, accounts serve as stepping stones
to more proﬁtable spam enterprises that degrade the qual-
ity of web services, such as pharmaceutical spam [17] or
fake anti-virus campaigns [25].
In this paper we describe our investigation of the un-
derground market proﬁting from Twitter credentials to
study how it operates, the impact the market has on Twit-
ter spam levels, and exactly how merchants circumvent
automated registration barriers.1 In total, we identiﬁed
and monitored 27 account merchants that advertise via
web storefronts, blackhat forums, and freelance labor
sites. With the express permission of Twitter, we con-
ducted a longitudinal study of these merchants and pur-
chased a total of 121,027 fraudulent Twitter accounts on
a bi-weekly basis over ten months from June, 2012 –
April, 2013. Throughout this process, we tracked ac-
count prices, availability, and fraud in the marketplace.
Our ﬁndings show that merchants thoroughly understand
Twitter’s existing defenses against automated registra-
tion, and as a result can generate thousands of accounts
with little disruption in availability or instability in pric-
ing.
In order to fulﬁll orders for fraudulent Twitter ac-
counts, we ﬁnd that merchants rely on CAPTCHA solving
services; fraudulent email credentials from Hotmail, Ya-
hoo, and mail.ru; and tens of thousands of hosts located
around the globe to provide a diverse pool of IP addresses

to evade blacklisting and throttling. In turn, merchants
stockpile accounts months in advance of their sale, where
“pre-aged” accounts have become a selling point in the
underground market. We identify which registration bar-
riers effectively increase the price of accounts and sum-
marize our observations into a set of recommendations
for how web services can improve existing automation
barriers to increase the cost of fraudulent credentials.
Finally, to estimate the overall impact the underground
market has on Twitter spam we leveraged our under-
standing of how merchants abuse the registration process
in order to develop a classiﬁer that retroactively detects
fraudulent accounts. We applied our classiﬁer to all ac-
counts registered on Twitter in the last year and iden-
tify several million suspected fraudulent accounts gener-
ated and sold via the underground market. During active
months, the 27 merchants we monitor appeared respon-
sible for registering 10–20% of all accounts later ﬂagged
by Twitter as spam. For their efforts, the merchants
generated an estimated total revenue between $127,000–
$459,000 from the sale of accounts.
With Twitter’s cooperation, we disable 95% of all
fraudulent accounts registered by the merchants we
track, including those previously sold but not yet sus-
pended for spamming. Throughout the suspension pro-
cess, we simultaneously monitor the underground market
for any fallout. While we do not observe an apprecia-
ble increase in pricing or delay in merchants delivering
new accounts, we ﬁnd 90% of all purchased accounts im-
mediately after our action are suspended on arrival. We
are now actively working with Twitter to integrate our
defense into their real-time detection framework to help
prevent abusive signups.
In summary, we frame our contributions as follows:
• We perform a 10 month longitudinal study of 27
merchants proﬁting from the sale of Twitter ac-
counts.
• We develop a classiﬁer based on registration signals
that detects several million fraudulent accounts that
merchants sold to generate $127,000–$459,000 in
revenue.
• We investigate the impact that the underground mar-
ket has on Twitter spam levels and ﬁnd 10–20%
all spam accounts originate from the merchants we
study.
• We investigate the failures of existing automated
registration barriers and provide a set of recommen-
dations to increase the cost of generating fraudulent
accounts.
2 Background
Fraudulent accounts are just a single facet of the
menagerie of digital criminal goods and services for sale
in the underground market. We provide an overview
of previous investigations into the digital blackmarket,
outline the role that account abuse plays in this space,
and summarize existing strategies for detecting spam and
abuse. Finally, in order to carry out our investigation of
the market for fraudulent Twitter accounts, we adhere to
a strict set of legal and ethical guidelines set down by our
institutions and by Twitter, documented here.
2.1 Underground Market
At the center of the for-proﬁt spam and malware ecosys-
tem is an underground market
that connects Inter-
net miscreants with parties selling a range of special-
ized products and services including spam hosting [2,
11], CAPTCHA solving services [19], pay-per-install
hosts [4], and exploit kits [9]. Even simple services such
as garnering favorable reviews or writing web page con-
tent are for sale [21, 31]. Revenue generated by miscre-
ants participating in this market varies widely based on
business strategy, with spam afﬁliate programs generat-
ing $12–$92 million [17] and fake anti-virus scammers
$5-116 million [25] over the course of their operations.
Specialization within this ecosystem is the norm.
Organized criminal communities include carders that
siphon credit card wealth [7]; email spam afﬁliate pro-
grams [16]; and browser exploit developers and trafﬁc
generators [9]. The appearance of account merchants
is yet another specialization where sellers enable other
miscreants to penetrate walled garden services, while
at the same time abstracting away the complexities of
CAPTCHA solving, acquiring unique emails, and dodg-
ing IP blacklisting. These accounts can then be used for a
multitude of activities, outlined below, that directly gen-
erate a proﬁt for miscreants.
2.2
Miscreants leverage fraudulent social networking ac-
counts to expose legitimate users to scams, phishing, and
malware [8, 10]. Spam monetization relies on both grey-
market and legitimate afﬁliate URL programs, ad syn-
dication services, and ad-based URL shortening [29].
Apart from for-proﬁt activities, miscreants have also
leveraged fraudulent accounts to launch attacks from
within Twitter for the express purposes of censoring po-
litical speech [28]. All of these examples serve to illus-
trate the deleterious effect that fraudulent accounts have
on social networks and user safety.

2.3 Spam Detection Strategies
The pervasive nuisance of spam in social networks has
lead to a multitude of detection strategies. These in-
clude analyzing social graph properties of sybil ac-
counts [6, 33, 34], characterizing the arrival rate and dis-
tribution of posts [8], analyzing statistical properties of
account proﬁles [3, 26], detecting spam URLs posted by
accounts [27], and identifying common spam redirect
paths [15]. While effective, all of these approaches rely
on at-abuse time metrics that target strong signals such
as sending a spam URL or forming hundreds of rela-
tionships in a short period. Consequently, at-abuse time
classiﬁers delay detection until an attack is underway,
potentially exposing legitimate users to spam activities
before enough evidence of nefarious behavior triggers
detection. Furthermore, dormant accounts registered
by account merchants will go undetected until miscre-
ants purchase the accounts and subsequently send spam.
Overcoming these shortcomings requires at-registration
abuse detection that ﬂags fraudulent accounts during the
registration process before any further interaction with a
web service can occur.
2.4 Ethical Considerations
Our study hinges on inﬁltrating the market for fraudulent
Twitter credentials where we interact with account mer-
chants and potentially galvanize the abuse of Twitter. We
do so with the express intent of understanding how sell-
ers register accounts and to disrupt their future efforts,
but that does not allay our legal or ethical obligations.
Prior to conducting our study, we worked with Twitter
and our institutions to set down guidelines for interacting
with merchants. A detailed summary of the restrictions
placed on our study is available in Appendix A
3 Marketplace for Twitter Accounts
We inﬁltrate the market for Twitter accounts to under-
stand its organization, pricing structure, and the avail-
ability of accounts over time. Through the course of
our study, we identify 27 account merchants (or sellers)
whom we purchase from on a bi-weekly basis from June,
2012 – April, 2013. We determine that merchants can
provide thousands of accounts within 24 hours at a price
of $0.02 – $0.10 per account.
Identifying Merchants
3.1
With no central operation of the underground market, we
resort to investigating common haunts: advertisements
via search engines, blackhat forums such as blackhat-
world.com, and freelance labor pages including Fiverr
and Freelancer [20, 21]. In total, we identify a disparate
group of 27 merchants. Of these, 10 operate their own
websites and allow purchases via automated forms, 5 so-
licit via blackhat forums, and 12 advertise via freelance
sites that take a cut from sales. Advertisements for Twit-
ter accounts range in offerings from credentials for ac-
counts with no proﬁle or picture, to “pre-aged” accounts2
that are months old with unique biographies and proﬁle
data. Merchants even offer 48 hours of support, during
which miscreants can request replacements for accounts
that are dysfunctional. We provide a detailed breakdown
of the merchants we identify and their source of solicita-
tion in Table 1. We make no claim our search for mer-
chants is exhaustive; nevertheless, the sellers we identify
provide an insightful cross-section of the varying levels
of sophistication required to circumvent automated ac-
count registration barriers, outlined in detail in Section 4.
3.2 Purchasing from Merchants
Once we identify a merchant, we place an initial test pur-
chase to determine the authenticity of the accounts being
sold. If genuine, we then determine whether to repeat-
edly purchase from the merchant based on the quality of
accounts provided (discussed in Section 4) and the over-
all impact the seller has on Twitter spam (discussed in
Section 6). As such, our purchasing is an iterative pro-
cess where each new set of accounts improves our un-
derstanding of the market and subsequently directs our
investigation.
Once we vet a merchant, we conduct purchases on a
bi-weekly basis beginning in June, 2012 (at the earliest)
up to the time of our analysis in April, 2013, detailed in
Table 1. We note that purchasing at regular intervals is
not always feasible due to logistical issues such as mer-
chants delaying delivery or failing to respond to requests
for accounts. In summary, we place 144 orders (140 of
which merchants successfully respond to and fulﬁll) for a
total of 120,019 accounts. Purchases typically consist of
a bulk order for 1,000 accounts, though sellers on Fiverr
operate in far less volume.
Throughout this process, we protect our identity from
merchants by using a number of email and Skype
pseudonyms. We conduct payments through multiple
identities tied to PayPal, WebMoney, and pre-paid credit
2Pre-aged accounts allow miscreants to evade heuristics that disable
newly minted accounts based upon weak, early signs of misbehavior. In
contrast, in order to limit the impact on legitimate users, disabling older
accounts only occurs in the face of much stronger signals of maleﬁ-
cence.
