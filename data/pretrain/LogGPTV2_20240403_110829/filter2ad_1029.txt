ABSTRACT
This demo presents PANDAA, a zero-conﬁguration auto-
matic spatial localization technique for networked devices
based on ambient sound sensing. We will demonstrate that
after initial placement of the devices, ambient sounds, such
as human speech, music, footsteps, ﬁnger snaps, hand claps,
or coughs and sneezes, can be used to autonomously resolve
the spatial relative arrangement of devices, such as mobile
phones, using trigonometric bounds and successive approx-
imation.

INTRODUCTION
Future ubiquitous home or oﬃce environments can con-
tain 10s or 100s of consumer devices connected through
wireless networks, such as mobile phones, laptops, smart
TVs, printers, etc. Ubiquitous services running on these
devices (i.e.
localizing users, routing, security algorithms)
will commonly require an accurate location of each device.
PANDAA (Physical Arrangement Detection of Networked
Devices through Ambient-Sound Awareness) is a spatial lo-
calization technique for networked devices in oﬃce and home
environments. Diﬀerent from previous work that uses special-
purpose hardware (e.g. ultrasonic transmitters [2]) or intru-
sive audible chirp sound [3], PANDAA leverages ambient
sound randomly and passively generated in indoor environ-
ments to automatically determine the physical arrangement
of devices without prior calibration of their location. To the
best of our knowledge, PANDAA is the ﬁrst indoor arrange-
ment detection technique that relies purely on the use of
ambient sounds and achieves high accuracy.

In this demo, we will show how the system operates, how
the algorithms in PANDAA manage to compensate for vari-
ous ambient noises, and highlight the system’s high accuracy
of location estimation (about 0.17m precision in a 50m2 in-
door space).
2. THE PANDAA TECHNIQUE
PANDAA leverages microphones that already exist in var-
ious consumer devices, such as mobile phones, laptops, smart
TVs, and context-aware systems (e.g. indoor acoustic sens-
ing systems [1, 4]), to detect usable segments of ambient
sound generated in a room. The time diﬀerence of sound
arrival (TDoA) between devices is calculated and used to
iteratively estimate inter-device distances. These distances
are then used to determine the overall arrangement of de-
vices. Finally, multiple TDoA measurements are combined
to improve arrangement detection accuracy over time. The
system architecture of PANDAA is shown in Figure 1.
The PANDAA system addresses several major challenges
of ambient sound-based arrangement detection as follows.
Challenge 1: Choosing Usable Ambient Sound Seg-
ments. Ambient sounds, such as music played on a radio,
human speech, noise from a working vacuum cleaner or a
barking dog, may vary signiﬁcantly in signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR). Low SNR sound may lead to poor TDoA estimation
accuracy. PANDAA addresses this challenge using an algo-

experiments were conducted.
rithm that detects impulsive sounds. Impulsive sounds are
short duration sounds with relatively higher amplitude, such
as human cough, ﬁnger snaps, or beats in a song. Using this
approach, PANDAA can automatically extract high SNR
sound events from a variety of ambient sound types, and
compute time diﬀerence of sound arrivals (TDoA) between
devices.
Challenge 2: Correcting Inaccurate TDoA Mea-
surements. In indoor environments, TDoA measurements
can be aﬀected by environmental factors, such as reﬂections,
non-line-of-sight path, or ambient noise. To compensate for
TDoA errors, PANDAA uses a novel two-tier TDoA aggre-
gation algorithm. The lower tier aggregates cross-spectrums
over successive audio frames in the same sound event to
suppress any uncorrelated frame-to-frame eﬀects. To han-
dle longer lasting ambient eﬀects, such as a moving person
blocking acoustic line-of-sight of several nodes, the upper-
tier aggregation averages TDoA estimates over multiple con-
secutive sound events belonging to the same sound source.
Challenge 3: Localizing Devices From TDoA Mea-
surements. TDoA measurements from one single sound
source are insuﬃcient for estimating distance between two
devices. PANDAA addresses this challenge by considering
TDoA measurements from multiple ambient sound sources
over time, to obtain pairwise TDoA measurements as an es-
timate of the lower bounds of the inter-device distances, and
use the distribution of TDoA measurements to estimate the
true inter-device distances, from which device arrangement
is derived.

IMPLEMENTATION
We have implemented the PANDAA system on Nokia
N900 mobile phones. The software on the phones was writ-
ten in C++, including the sound event detection, the device
synchronization, and the audio transmission modules. The
code on the server was written in MATLAB, including the
TDoA aggregation and the location estimation module, as
well as a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying the
actual and estimated device arrangement. Figure 2 (left)
shows a Nokia N900 phone displaying client-end GUI dur-
ing an experiment. Figure 2 (right) shows a typical meeting
room where we did our previous experiments.
The mobile phones are synchronized between each other
using well developed synchronization techniques. To achieve
required precision, we used the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
to synchronize the devices to a laptop and modiﬁed the stan-
dard QT libraries to timestamp the audio recording with
high precision.

4. DEMO DESCRIPTION
We will demonstrate the PANDAA technique that com-
prises a number of mobile devices connected through wire-
less networks. Several mobile phones and laptops will be
randomly placed in the demo area, without calibrating their
locations. Then, attendees will be encouraged to generate
a number of ambient sounds at diﬀerent and arbitrary lo-
cations in the demo area, such as human speech, coughs,
ﬁnger snaps, hand claps or by singing a song. We will then
use our laptop that runs the server-end program to show the
detected impulsive sound segments (events) in real time, as
well as the estimated device arrangement on a GUI. Figure
3 shows the GUI that will be used in the demo. As am-
bient sounds are generated in the demonstration area, the
estimated device arrangement will be updated in real time.
We also develop software packages of PANDAA’s client-
end code, and provide the packages in terms of Android apps
or iPhone apps on the Web. Attendees will also be encour-
aged to download these apps to their own mobile devices,
and use the PANDAA technique to localize their devices
during the demo.
