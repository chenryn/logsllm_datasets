ceived a warranty replacement reset to the factory settings. He

indicated that he plans to re-enable it, and that our prompting re-
minded him. Similarly, the two other participants indicated that
they were still planning to enable locking. Thus, for over a third of
our participants who did not lock their devices, it was not a willful
decision, but an oversight. In total, twenty-three (82% of 28; 95%
CI:[0.63, 0.94]) were unopposed to locking their devices.
However, the remaining ﬁve participants who did not lock their
smartphones made deliberate decisions. These ﬁve participants all
stated that locking their devices would not be worth the effort.
Speciﬁcally, three participants (38% of 8) mentioned that the in-
convenience was too great. Two participants, P10 and P24, specif-
ically mentioned the ability for strangers to use their phones in the
case of an emergency:
“I was worried that if I got into an accident and some-
body needed to call like my girlfriend that they wouldn’t
be able to get into my phone...” (P10)
“...like if I’ve got into an accident and I couldn’t tell
them what [the lock] was or something like that” (P24)
The third participant mentioned personal experiences ﬁnding lost
phones and returning them to the owners because she was able to
browse through their contact lists. Thus, she was worried that if she
locked her own phone, it would decrease the likelihood of getting
it back if she ever lost it:
“...if I lost my phone, I trust in people enough that they
would open it up and try and get hold of someone in-
stead of stealing it. I just, I have best hopes for people
so...I just, I found a few phones, and I wouldn’t have
been able to help the person if it was locked...I’m to-
tally 50/50 split on this” (P18)
P18 was unaware that both Android and iOS include features to
help the ﬁnder of a lost phone locate the owner. Android allows
the owner to display contact information on the lock screen [9],
whereas Apple’s Find My iPhone application allows the owner to
put her device into “lost mode” from a website, which displays her
contact information on the lock screen [2]. Of course, this does not
address the issue of being able to display information during emer-
gencies. Some people have resorted to adding address book con-
tacts under the heading “ICE,” which stands for In Case of Emer-
gency [24]; several different applications have also been developed
to place this information on the lock screen. However, none of the
major smartphone platforms provide this feature by default.
Finally, two participants (25% of 8) did not believe they had any
information worth protecting:
“I’m not worried about losing my phone, or having
somebody pick up my phone and use it" (P15)
“I don’t feel like I keep anything valuable on here...there’s
nothing in here I feel like I need to protect. Yeah, if
I started having ﬁnancial information or if there was
a reason that people could get to my passwords...that
would be a reason to lock it up.” (P21)
Both of these participants claimed to regularly backup their data
and therefore were not at risk of data loss. The most sensitive data
on their devices appeared to be email, as neither had any applica-
tions that stored sensitive data (e.g., banking). Likewise, these par-
ticipants had installed a median of 14 applications, whereas the re-
6
maining 26 participants had installed a median of 31 applications.3
Thus, it is possible that these participants’ decisions to not lock
their devices was rational, however, it is not possible to say with
certainty without knowing whether any potentially sensitive infor-
mation is contained in their email accounts (and therefore accessi-
ble through their unlocked smartphones).
4.4 Comparison with Online Sample
To quantify why smartphone users choose or choose not to lock
their devices, we conducted a separate online survey.
4.4.1 Methodology
We commissioned a survey using Google Consumer Surveys (GCS)
that featured two multiple-choice questions. The ﬁrst question,
“What secret unlock method do you use on your smartphone?,” fea-
tured the following options:
• I don’t have a smartphone
• None (I just slide to unlock)
• PIN / Passcode / Password / Pattern
• Fingerprint
• Other
We asked participants who reported using a security lock (i.e.,
PIN, passcode, password, pattern, or ﬁngerprint), “Why did you
decide to use a locking method on your smartphone?” We provided
the following options, with instructions to select all that applied:
• Prevent strangers from using my phone
• Control when friends/family use my phone
• I’ve never thought about why I use one
• It’s easy to do
• Other people I know use a security lock
• None of the above
For participants who indicated that they did not use a security
lock, we asked, “Why did you decide not to use a locking method
on your smartphone?” We provided the following options, with
instructions to select all that applied:
• In an emergency, others can use my phone
• It’s too much of a hassle
• I’ve never thought about it
• No one would care about what’s on my phone
• None of the above
The possible answers to each question were based on the most
popular reasons for using or not using a security lock, as deter-
mined by our in-person interviews, and were not mutually-exclusive
(with the exception of “none of the above”). Overall, we received a
total of 2,518 responses from smartphone users to the ﬁrst question
(i.e., the locking method used). These responses were split roughly
60-40 in favor of locking: 1,470 respondents claimed to lock their
smartphones (58% of 2,518), whereas 1,048 respondents claimed
to not lock their smartphones (42% of 2,518).
We received 500 responses for why security locks were used and
500 responses for why security locks were not used. Thus, our anal-
ysis only focuses on these 1,000 participants. Our data included de-
mographic inferences (rather than relying on self-reporting). Gen-
der was reported for 797 of these participants (56% male), age
3The sample size of two is insufﬁcient to compare whether this
difference in medians is statistically signiﬁcant.

their smartphones, as well as another 500 participants who ex-
plained why they chose not to lock their smartphones.
ranges were reported for 776 respondents (median of 35-44 years),
and income ranges were reported for 995 participants (median in-
come range of $25,000-$49,999). Finally, the vast majority of our
participants resided in urban or suburban areas (86%), while 12%
resided in rural areas. Based on these demographics, we believe
that our sample is reasonably representative of the U.S. smartphone-
using population.
4.4.2 Results
Overall, we observed that a majority of participants (55% of 500)
claimed to lock their devices to prevent unauthorized access by
strangers, whereas only 23% indicated that it was to regulate usage
by friends and family (Table 1). Of those opting not to lock their
devices, a plurality believed it was too much of a hassle (34% of
500) and 26% did not believe their devices could be used to access
sensitive data.
Our initial in-person interviews followed a grounded theory ap-
proach to uncover the different explanations for why participants
chose or chose not to lock their devices [19], whereas the goal of
our online survey was to measure how prevalent these explanations
were among the population at large. For this reason, and because
the two experiments were performed at different times, using differ-
ent methods, and on different samples, direct statistical comparison
of the two experiments would not be meaningful.
We believe these results validate the ﬁndings from our in-person
interviews, because the possible reasons that we uncovered for lock-
ing or not locking one’s smartphone were applicable to 84% of our
1,000 online survey respondents. Only 12% of those locking their
smartphones (61 of 500) and 20% of those not locking their smart-
phones (101 of 500) indicated that they did so for a reason other
than any of the ones that we provided to them.
4.5 Perceived Threats
To understand interview participants’ motivations for locking their
devices, we presented them with several scenarios involving data
compromise on their smartphones. In one scenario, we asked them
what the worst personal consequences would be if strangers gained
access to their phones and whether they thought someone could
then impersonate them. In another, we asked about professional
consequences. Finally, we asked whether they had any concerns
about the data stored on their signiﬁcant others’ smartphones.
Only one participant believed that he would not face any personal
consequences if a stranger gained access to his smartphone. The re-
maining participants fell into a handful of non-mutually-exclusive
categories, the most common of which related to online identity
theft (61% of 28). These seventeen participants cited concerns
7
about online account compromise, rather than someone imperson-
ating them ofﬂine. Despite us priming participants to think about
identity theft (i.e., we directly asked them about an attacker’s abil-
ity to impersonate them), only one participant made the connection
between ofﬂine and online identity. This participant mentioned that
he had a scan of his passport in his Dropbox account and was con-
cerned it could be used to steal his ofﬂine identity.
Similar to identity theft, the second most common theme related
to strangers using participants’ smartphones to impersonate them
online. Seven participants (25% of 28) speciﬁcally mentioned so-
cial networking accounts, such as a stranger being able to post
to Facebook or read previous posts. Participants were also likely
primed to this concern because they previously had gone through
their installed applications and indicated whether or not each one
required authentication. Seven participants (25% of 28) mentioned
general privacy concerns, such as knowing someone might be look-
ing through their personal photos or contacts.
We were surprised that beyond the loss of the hardware itself,
only six participants (21% of 28) raised concerns relating to ﬁnan-
cial loss. Five (18% of 28) were concerned with a stranger ac-
cessing their banking information, such as their account details via
an installed banking application, while three participants (11% of
28) were concerned that their lost phones would be used to make
purchases via applications that they had installed (e.g., Amazon,
Groupon, Starbucks, Uber, etc.).
During the beginning of each interview, we asked participants
to state their occupations. While two were unemployed and two
others were full-time students, the remaining 24 participants held
a wide variety of different occupations, which are listed in Ap-
pendix B. Eighteen participants (64% of 28) did not believe there
would be any professional consequences, and none of our partic-
ipants indicated that they would be required to report the loss to
their employers or that they risked being ﬁred. Of those concerned
about professional consequences, the most common concern was
having one’s reputation damaged by inappropriate communication
with work contacts, which was voiced by ﬁve participants (18% of
28). Three (11% of 28) were concerned about strangers seeing sen-
sitive work-related information, and another two (7%) were con-
cerned that strangers would have access to data inappropriate for
the work place, which could then be disseminated to coworkers.
Eighteen of our participants had smartphone-owning signiﬁcant
others. Of these participants, only ﬁve (28% of 18) voiced concerns
over the security of the data stored on their partner’s phone. With-
out prompting them to describe that data, three outright volunteered
that their partners stored intimate photos:
“Not my phone number so much as naked pictures...yeah
that probably wouldn’t be a good thing.” (P1)
“Besides the naked girlfriend pictures?” (P7)
“Maybe sexy pictures or something, but I don’t know
where he keeps those.” (P16)
The remaining two participants voiced concerns over sensitive
personal emails and a partner potentially jeopardizing his security
clearance. For the participants who were unconcerned, two primary
reasons emerged. Ten (77% of 13) did not believe their signiﬁcant
other stored any sensitive information and three (23% of 13) be-
lieved their signiﬁcant other was taking adequate precautions.
Overall, our interview and survey data suggest that many smart-
phone users choose not to protect their devices because they do not
believe any sensitive information is stored on them. While many of
the interview participants who did not lock their devices had fewer
applications installed, and therefore potentially less sensitive infor-
mation, every participant’s smartphone still had access to email,
which did not require additional authentication. Thus, it is possible
that these email accounts might be a fruitful target for an attacker.
5. ACTUAL RISKS
In this section, we attempt to quantify the risks that participants
might face if their smartphones are accessed by unauthorized in-
dividuals, and how those risks compare with the risk perceptions
of our interview participants. Based on our hypothesis that some
participants undervalued the risk posed by access to email, we per-
formed an online experiment to quantify the types of sensitive in-
formation that might be found in an individual’s email account.
5.1 Email Risks
All 28 interview participants had the passwords for their primary
email addresses saved on their phones, such that an attacker with
access to the device in an unlocked state could control the owner’s
email account. Because many online services use email for pass-
word recovery, email accounts can be an overlooked attack vec-
tor for an attacker trying to gain access to other applications and
accounts. Beyond actively using a stolen email account to gain
access to other services by using it to reset their passwords, we
were curious about the types of sensitive information a motivated
attacker could ﬁnd about a victim in that victim’s email archive,
which would be searchable from a stolen device.
5.1.1 Methodology
We conducted an online survey of email users to understand the
types of sensitive information that could be found in their email ac-
counts. We recruited 1,000 participants via Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk to search through their email archives for different types of
personal information, to report how many hits their searches turned
up, to describe the contexts of the found emails, and to indicate
how surprised they were by the results. We restricted participa-
