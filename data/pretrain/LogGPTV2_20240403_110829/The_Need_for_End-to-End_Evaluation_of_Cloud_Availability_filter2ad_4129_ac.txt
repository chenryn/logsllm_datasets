### Network and Application-Level Measurements of Cloud Service Availability

#### Case Study: Koszalin University of Technology to Amazon S3 Singapore

During our measurement period, we observed intermittent failures between the Koszalin University of Technology in Poland and the Amazon S3 site in Singapore. This case highlights that network issues, such as routing problems, can persist for extended periods. Both ICMP and HTTP reported outages for this vantage point (VP).

- **ICMP**: 9 fails
- **HTTP**: 9 fails
- **ICMP**: 0 < fails < 9
- **HTTP**: 0 < fails < 9

### Method Disagreement

ICMP and HTTP probes can sometimes show disagreement. In our observations, this discrepancy occurs in 0.01% to 3% of cases, as shown in Figure 3. The primary source of disagreement is when ICMP fails but HTTP succeeds (indicated by red striped bars), though occasionally, ICMP succeeds while HTTP fails (indicated by blue bars).

**Example 1: ICMP Fails, HTTP Succeeds**
- **Figure 6**: Three Swiss universities could not reach Amazon/VM in California.
- **Analysis**: Using `tcpdump`, we observed filtering on the return path. Since the VPs are at different sites in the same country, we hypothesize that reverse path changes, possibly to a path that filtered ICMP, caused the outage. Despite ICMP reporting multiple outages, data could still be fetched from the cloud, indicating that ICMP over-counts outages.

**Example 2: HTTP Fails, ICMP Succeeds**
- **Figures 5 and 7**: Two VPs in Russia observed an HTTP-only outage to both Amazon S3 and EC2 in Singapore.
- **Analysis**: We observed route changes before and after the outage and confirmed that our probes (TCP SYNs) reached the VM and replies were sent but did not reach the VP. The root cause remains unconfirmed, but it may involve load-balancer issues at the cloud's edge.

### Differences Between Probing VMs and Storage

In addition to comparing network and application-level probing, we also probed different targets: virtual machines (VMs) and storage. The target affects what the probing mechanism sees. End-to-end measurements are essential to observe outages in cloud storage and other systems with complex back-ends.

**Example: Amazon S3 (Tokyo) Outage on April 16**
- **Figure 8**: Only HTTP measurements detected this outage; ICMP reported no issues.
- **Analysis**: ICMP measures only to the front-end, while HTTP provides an end-to-end test, verifying the storage system's functionality. This indicates that the outage was within Amazonâ€™s storage system, not the network. Therefore, ICMP overestimates the availability of cloud storage, supporting our recommendation for end-to-end testing for higher-level cloud services.

### Root Cause Analysis

To understand the root cause of these storage outages, we analyzed errors reported by our storage retrieval tool (curl). Most failures (87%) were due to DNS lookup failure, with TCP connection setup failure (10%) being the second largest cause. For VMs, almost all failures (99%) were due to TCP connection setup failures. These DNS failures can represent either random loss of the request or issues with the storage system's DNS mechanism.

### Conclusion

Our study compared network and application-level measurements for cloud service availability. We found that ICMP can both over- and under-report outages, suggesting that end-to-end measures (such as HTTP) are crucial for accurately characterizing cloud service availability. Our findings raise concerns about the use of ICMP for monitoring and suggest that earlier results should be revisited. We are using these approaches as part of a long-term study of cloud availability to deploy highly-available systems at low cost across various cloud providers.
