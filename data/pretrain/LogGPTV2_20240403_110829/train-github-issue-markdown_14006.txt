**What happened** :  
How to specify "severity" to container logs?  
I'm running with kubernetes on gce.  
And I want to specify "severity" to container logs.
I know that normally the logs written to stdout got tagged with the INFO
severity and logs written to stderr got tagged with the ERROR severity.
I have a question.  
In the future, container log Will be able to specify the severity?
**What you expected to happen** :  
Is there any plan to specification of container log is improved, if that is I
want to hear whether the planned release time.
