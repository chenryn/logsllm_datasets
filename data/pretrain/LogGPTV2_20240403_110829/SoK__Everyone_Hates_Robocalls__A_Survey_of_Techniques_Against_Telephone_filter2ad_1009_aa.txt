Abstract—Telephone spam costs United States consumers
$8.6 billion annually. In 2014, the Federal Trade Commission
has received over 22 million complaints of illegal and wanted
calls. Telephone spammers today are leveraging recent techni-
cal advances in the telephony ecosystem to distribute massive
automated spam calls known as robocalls. Given that anti-spam
techniques and approaches are effective in the email domain,
the question we address is: what are the effective defenses
against spam calls?
In this paper, we ﬁrst describe the telephone spam ecosys-
tem, speciﬁcally focusing on the differences between email
and telephone spam. Then, we survey the existing telephone
spam solutions and, by analyzing the failings of the current
techniques, derive evaluation criteria that are critical to an
acceptable solution. We believe that this work will help guide
the development of effective telephone spam defenses, as well
as provide a framework to evaluate future defenses.
I. INTRODUCTION
The national and global telephony system is a critical
component of our modern infrastructure and economy. In
the United States (US), the mobile telephone subscribership
penetration rate has already surpassed 100% [1]. According
to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, each day more than
240 million hours are spent on telephone calls in the United
States, equating to more than 88 trillion hours each year [2].
However, with the pervasiveness of telephone service
subscribership, telephone spam has also become an increas-
ingly prevalent issue in the US. Recent technical advances
in the telephony ecosystem are leveraged by spammers to
distribute massive automated spam calls, known as robo-
calls. The Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) National Do
Not Call Registry’s cumulative number of complaints of
illegal calls in the US totaled more than 22 million in
2014 [3], with about 200,000 complaints each month about
robocalls alone [4]. Despite US laws prohibiting robocalling
and telephone spamming (with some exceptions), complaints
on illegal calls have reached record numbers year after
year, which indicates that the laws have not deterred the
spammers.
Spam calls are signiﬁcant annoyances for telephone users.
Unlike email spam, which can be ignored, spam calls
demand immediate attention. When a phone rings, a call
recipient generally must decide whether to accept the call
and listen to the call. After realizing that the call contains
unwanted information and disconnects from the call, the
recipient has already lost time, money (phone bill), and
least 6 seconds. Even when the recipient
productivity. A study in 2014 by Kimball et al. [5] found
that 75% of people listened to over 19 seconds of a robocall
message and the vast majority of people, 97%, listen to
at
ignores or
declines the call, today spammers can send a prerecorded
audio message directly into the recipient’s voicemail inbox.
Deleting a junk voicemail wastes even more time, taking at
least 6 steps to complete in a typical voicemail system.
Telephone spam are not only signiﬁcant annoyances,
they also result in signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss in the econ-
omy, mostly due to scams and identity theft. According
to complaint data collected by the FTC, Americans lose
more than $8.6 billion due to fraud annually, and the vast
majority of them (and still increasing) are due to phone
communication [4]. This situation is surprising, given the
signiﬁcant gains made in reducing the amount of email
spam. This raises the question: are there any simple and
effective solutions that could stop telephone spam? The un-
fortunate answer is no. We found that this issue is not easily
solved, and, in fact, the simple and effective techniques
against email spam cannot be applied to telephone systems.
There are signiﬁcant differences and unique challenges in the
telephone ecosystem that require novel approaches. Many
existing solutions have failed to overcome these challenges
and, as a result, have yet to be widely implemented.
The objective of this paper is to survey the existing
solutions in combating telephone spam and, by analyzing the
failings of the current techniques, derive the requirements
that are critical to an acceptable solution. This work will
help guide the development of effective telephone spam
defenses, as well as provide a framework to help evaluate
the techniques against telephone spam.
The main contributions of this paper are the following:
• We describe the telephone spam ecosystem, focusing
on the players involved and the technical challenges
that make telephone spam distinct from email spam.
• We develop a taxonomy that classiﬁes the existing anti-
spam techniques into three categories, providing a high-
level view of the beneﬁts and drawbacks of each type
of technique.
• We provide a systematization of assessment criteria
for evaluating telephone spam countermeasures, and
we evaluate existing techniques using these assessment
criteria.

II. BACKGROUND
While email spam is arguably the most well-known form
of spam, telephone spam is now more popular than ever.
The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is an
aggregate of various interconnected telephone networks that
adheres to the core standards created by the International
Telecommunication Union, allowing most
telephones to
intercommunicate. We deﬁne telephone spam as the mass
distribution of unwanted content to modern telephones in the
PSTN, which includes voice spam that distributes unwanted
voice content
to answered phones, and voicemail spam
that distributes unwanted voice content into the recipient’s
voicemail inbox.
Due to the much greater capacity of IP infrastructure
and the wide availability of IP-based equipment, telephony
service providers have shifted their network infrastructure to
IP-based solutions, and the operation cost of the telephone
network has dramatically decreased. While the core PSTN
infrastructure has evolved to be almost entirely IP-based,
the core signaling protocols have not changed. The entire
ecosystem still relies on the three-decade-old Signaling Sys-
tem No. 7 (SS7) [6] suite of protocols, allowing any phone to
reach any other phone through a worldwide interconnection
of switching centers.
A very common way of disseminating telephone spam
is robocalling, which uses an autodialer that automatically
dials and delivers a prerecorded message to a list of phone
numbers. An autodialer is a generic term for any com-
puter program or device that can automatically initiate calls
to telephone recipients. Today, an autodialer is usually a
computer program with Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
connectivity to a high volume VoIP-to-PSTN carrier, that
may include features such as voicemail and SMS delivery,
customizable caller ID, Call Progress Analysis, scheduled
broadcast, text-to-speech, Interactive Voice Response, etc.
The high reachability of telephone numbers has led to
telephony being an attractive spam distribution channel. Al-
most every adult in the US can be reached with a telephone
number, and the vast majority of telephone numbers are
mobile telephone subscribers. Although VoIP usage has been
growing rapidly, we found that it is more of an add-on
protocol (instead of a wholesale replacement) of existing
mobile wireless and landline services. Using 2013 statistics,
there are about 335 million mobile telephone subscribers [1],
136 million ﬁxed-telephone subscribers [7], and 34 million
VoIP subscribers [8] in the US (population 318 million).
We believe the improved cost efﬁciency of telephone
spamming, advancement of spam distribution technology,
and high reachability of telephone numbers contributed to
the recent surge in telephone spam. Furthermore, we believe
that telephone spam has the potential to be more persuasive

A. Key Players of Telephone Spam
To understand the telephone spam ecosystem, we will ﬁrst
identify and explain the roles of all players who take part in
the routing of a telephone spam. Figure 1 show a graph-
ical depiction of the routing process: The spammer con-
nects through the Internet to an Internet Telephony Service
Provider, then the call is routed through an Interexchange
Carrier, before ﬁnally being accepted by the Termination
Carrier, who then routes the call to the victim.
Another way to understand the ecosystem is to show
how money ﬂows through the system, which we display in
Figure 2: the money ﬂows from the victim to the spammer,
and the spammer uses this money to obtain leads (new phone
numbers to spam) and to pay for the spam calls, the Internet
Telephony Service Provider receives the money from the
spammer and pays the Interexchange Carrier, who then pays
the Termination Carrier. Next we examine each of these
roles in turn.
Spammer is the agent that carries out the spamming
operation. The spammer could be part of an organization,
or an independent contractor that offers spamming-as-a-
service. The goal of the spammer is usually to extract
money from victims through sales and scams, or to launch
a campaign of harassment. For cost efﬁciency, spam calls
are typically initiated using an autodialer connected to an
Internet Telephony Service Provider to reach the PSTN
victims. Currently, spamming to VoIP victims are not as
common, mainly due to the limited pool of potential victims,
and some VoIP users, such as Skype, may not be reachable
most of the time. We will describe the spammer’s operation
in more detail in Section II-B.

Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP), also
known as a VoIP carrier, is a type of termination carrier that
offers telecommunications service over the TCP/IP network,
i.e. the Internet. The ITSP typically offers high volume
calling at a lower cost compared to traditional carriers, and
generates revenue based on the minutes of calls hosted.
Whenever the spammer makes an outbound call to a PSTN
number, the ITSP will convert the signaling protocol from
VoIP to SS7, and route the converted signal through an
interexchange carrier.
Interexchange Carrier (IXC), also known as a long
distance carrier, is a cross-regional carrier that carries call
trafﬁc between telephone exchanges over long distances.
The IXC charges its subscribers (mainly termination carrier
such as the ITSPs and local mobile/landline carriers) for
handling long distance phone calls and compensates the
next-hop carrier (such as the recipient’s termination car-
rier) for access. Unlike the peering model between Internet
service providers [9], the IXC negotiates access rates with
other carriers, known as intercarrier compensation. In the
US, intercarrier compensation [10] is a complex system in
which the rates vary according to trafﬁc origination, location,
carrier, and trafﬁc type, and the rates are governed by
federal and state regulators. In general, when two carriers are
directly connected, the originating carrier compensates the
next-hop carrier for routing the call in the next-hop carrier’s
network.
Termination Carrier, also known as local exchange
carrier, is a carrier that provides call routing services within
a local network that terminates at its end users. The termi-
nation carrier may be operating a landline, mobile, or IP-
based telephone network. Most consumers and businesses
rely on termination carriers for their telecommunications
services. The termination carrier typically bills the IXC for
the amount of incoming trafﬁc, known as the access charge.
In the US and some other countries, the recipient subscriber
may also be partially billed for incoming calls.
B. Spammer Operation
Spamming (regardless of the medium) requires three basic
elements: a recipient list, content, and a mass distribution
channel. In addition, a more sophisticated spammer may
employ circumvention measures to defeat spam counter-
measures, and to avoid being stopped by law enforcement
agencies.
1) Gathering Numbers: Spamming ﬁrst requires a list of
potential victims to contact, and in the case of telephone
spam: a list of phone numbers. While there are many ways
a spammer could gather phone numbers, the simplest method
is to purchase the numbers from a leads seller. We did
a simple Google search (keyword “leads for sale”) and
found hundreds of websites that offers access to millions
of curated phone numbers for less than $100. There are
also other ways to harvest phone numbers, such as crawling
322322
the web, collecting form submissions, downloading leak
databases, covertly gathering through smartphone apps, or
simply generating the numbers based on phone numbering
plans. However, we do not know for sure the most popular
means of obtaining a list of phone numbers for spamming,
due to the lack of existing studies. Once the spammer gathers
a list of phone numbers, the spammer can load it in an
autodialer for mass distribution of the content.
2) Voice Spam Content: The content of telephone spam is
typically a prerecorded audio stream made by either record-
ing human voice or by using a text-to-speech synthesizer
program. Telephone spam can also deliver interactive voice
content, with the use of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
system. When the recipient answers a call from an autodialer
with interactive content, the recipient can interact with the
system through voice and keypad inputs, and an automated
voice message is played back based on the interaction.
There are a wide variety of spam types, such as tele-
marketing,
impersonation scam, debt collection, political
campaigns, one-ring scam, and so on. In order to provide
insight into the telephone spam content, we collected 100
audio samples from various publicly available sources where
audio recordings of voice or voicemail spam are uploaded.
