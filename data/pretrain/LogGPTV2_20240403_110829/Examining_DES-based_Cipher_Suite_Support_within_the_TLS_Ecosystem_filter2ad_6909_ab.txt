results of the handshake, the program stores both the IP address
queried and the results into a JSON file. These files are then loaded
into an Apache Spark server for data analysis. Figure 1 provides a
high-level overview of our implementation pipeline.
Where ZMap is able to query the entire IPv4 address space in
less than 5 minutes, our program was able to attempt SSL/TLS hand-
shakes with about 800,000 IP addresses in roughly 24 hours. This is
largely due to the difference in implementation between ZMap and
ZGrab2 (we discuss the operation of ZMap in Section 2.3). ZGrab2
will initiate a TLS handshake with a given IP address and attempt to
fully establish a session, thus taking significantly longer to generate
key pairs and return pertinent server information. Additionally, we
configured the ZGrab2 automator to attempt handshakes with each
DES cipher individually, meaning that a thread would attempt 36
handshakes for every IP address. Exceptions included various time-
out errors (e.g., connection-timeout) where the automator would
abort further handshake attempts with the unresponsive IP address
after the first unsuccessful scan.
Once we obtained results from our ZGrab2 scans, we selected
unique IP addresses that accepted at least one DES cipher in order
to perform reverse-DNS queries. Similar to the ZGrab2 automator,
we used a threaded Python program to read in lists of IP addresses
and query each one once for a hostname. These hostnames, and
additional geolocation data gathered from Censys, were then joined
on their corresponding IP addresses and added to the total set of
raw data for analysis.
4 ANALYSIS
Our collection period spanned a little over five months from 16
November 2018 to 1 May 2019. During that time, we made over
939 million handshake attempts to over 31 million IPv4 addresses,
resulting in over 274GB of raw data. In this section, we analyze
this data to determine the prevalence of DES cipher support among
unique IP addresses and popular domains, investigate general loca-
tion data of supporting servers, and characterize hosts which most
commonly provide DES support.
Figure 1: The ZGrab2 automator takes lists of IP addresses
from Censys and creates worker threads that query each IP
with a DES cipher. It stores the results of the attempted hand-
shake on an internal server, where we analyze it using PyS-
park.
Figure 2: A broad overview of the number of times a cipher
was negotiated in a successful TLS handshake.
4.1 DES Cipher Use
We query over 31 million unique IPv4 addresses out of a total of 41
million addresses reported by Censys. These were queried over port
443 using ZGrab2 and we find that 40.5% of them accept at least
1 of the 36 DES ciphers negotiated in an SSL/TLS handshake. In
total we had 12,829,045 servers accept a TLS handshake negotiated
with a DES cipher out of 31,619,709 queried servers. Of the 36
ciphers presented as handshake encryption algorithms, only 10
were successfully negotiated. An itemized breakdown is given in
Figure 2.
Many successful handshakes (673,302) were made with export
ciphers. Since encryption was treated as a munitions by the US
government, creating weaker forms of encryption was often neces-
sary to allow the export of such algorithms to other countries [14].
Export ciphers are prohibited from using RSA with moduli greater
than 512 bits, reducing public key sizes to at most 512 bits and
reducing the integrity of the ciphersuite.
Of some concern is the support for DES40 with 673,302 accepted
handshakes. As discussed previously, DES40 is trivially easy to
break. While it sees relatively little use compared to 3DES, these
servers remain vulnerable to eavesdropping and traffic tamper-
ing. Despite the slightly longer key, DES56 (with 711,202 accepted
handshakes) is subject to similar concerns.

The DH-anon and ECDH-anon ciphers (accepted in 8,414 and
8,066 handshakes, respectively) are ciphers which do not authenti-
cate a server’s certificate, and are thus vulnerable to man-in-the-
middle attacks. The support for DH-anon is particularly egregious,
as it combines a disregard for server certificate authentication with
a thoroughly broken encryption cipher [24].
Fortunately, it is evident that the majority of accepted hand-
shakes are negotiated with 3DES ciphersuites (17,487,797 hand-
shakes). While officially deprecated, 3DES is stronger than DES56
and was encouraged by NIST as a temporary alternative algorithm
immediately following the deprecation of DES56 until 2017. It
should be expected that 3DES use will decrease over time as more
organizations and websites upgrade their infrastructure to support
AES instead of DES56 and 3DES, but as the continued use of DES
ciphers prove, this is not a guarantee and unlikely to happen for
several more years.
Alexa Top 1000. Despite being the most-accessed websites in the
online world, arguably communicating and processing sensitive
network traffic every day, domains belonging in the Alexa Top
10001 continue to support 3DES. However, as seen in Figure 3, the
overall support for DES ciphers (34%) is lower here than in the
IPv4 space in general (40.5%), with only three servers accepting
DES40 (youdao.com, 4399.com, and book18.com), and none allowing
anonymous ciphers to be used.
4.2 Geolocation Data
In addition to unique IP addresses and domains that accepted DES ci-
phers, we wished to measure the prevalence of DES support around
the world. To that end, we rely on geolocation data provided by
Maxmind through Censys.2 Figures 4, 5, and 6 display the resulting
plotted location data. Bubble size is proportional to the number
of accepting servers in a location, while color depth represents
total number of supporting servers for each cipher in each coun-
try. Smaller values are also represented as bubbles to show more
granular server locations, in addition to their respective countries’
heatmap. (No such filters were needed to render the later choropleth
1While we focused on the Alexa Top 1000, 78 servers did not respond to an attempted
TLS connection and timed out, leaving us with 922 IP addresses to analyze.
2Determining the geolocation of IP addresses is often an imprecise art. As such, these
locations likely cannot give a fine-grained perspective for DES support, but for the
purposes of this paper, it is more than sufficient.

plots.) It is worth noting that the maps representing both DES40
and DES56 are plotted on a smaller scale than 3DES, as 3DES sees
far more support on servers worldwide.
For Figures 4, 5, and 6, many patterns appear to repeat themselves.
The majority of IP addresses are concentrated in densely populated
areas of the US, Europe, and East Asia. As expected, 3DES sees far
more global use than either DES40 or DES56. Due to the omission
of areas with fewer than 50 DES-accepting IPs, large areas in South
America, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia are bare. Countries

typically seem to support DES40 on fewer servers than they support
DES56, and support for 3DES is orders of magnitude larger almost
without exception.
Few exceptions do exist, however. Contrary to other countries’
proportional support of DES, Singapore and Haiti maintain some
support for DES56 but seemingly more support for DES40. Com-
paring population bubbles between Figure 4 and 5, we can see a
slight decrease going from DES40 to DES56. In Kazakhstan, vir-
tually no DES56 ciphers are supported despite being the largest
global supporter of DES40. Where other countries have much more
support for 3DES in proportion to their DES40 and DES56 values,
Kazakhstan has very little 3DES presence in Figure 6.
Despite these abnormalities, it is clear that DES40 and DES56
find limited support relative to 3DES cipher support.
Perhaps more telling is the percent that each country supports
specific DES ciphers relative to the number of unique servers re-
siding within their borders. Figure 7a gives a breakdown of DES40
acceptance relative to other countries. In particular, 32.7% of servers
we were able to query within Kazakhstan support DES40, rein-
forcing previous findings in Figure 4. Other countries that accept
DES40 at higher rates include Liberia (17.8%), Saint Martin (9.7%),
and Lebanon (9.1%). While North Korea reports a DES40 acceptance
rate of 100%, we were only able to query a single North Korean
server, thus it is excluded in this analysis. For similar reasons, coun-
tries reporting fewer than 100 IP addresses were also excluded.
All other countries accept DES40 with fewer than 9% of domestic
servers. Figure 7b tells a similar story, with the only major DES56
acceptance found in Niger (24.1%), Liberia (19.1%), Canada (13.7%)
and Hong Kong (12.4%). Other countries maintain DES56 support
with fewer than 10% of their servers.
Lastly, Figure 7c provides an overview of 3DES support per coun-
try. Where the weaker two DES ciphers were typically supported by
a small fraction of servers in each country, 3DES is highly supported
by over 40% of servers in a large majority of nations. Puerto Rico sits
just shy of a majority of 3DES supporting servers with 49.7% 3DES
support rates, while 68.6% of Mongolian servers and just 19.3% of
Pakistani servers support 3DES. 3DES also finds significant support
in Europe with 41.9% of servers in the UK and 26.3% of all German
servers accepting 3DES handshakes. In North America, Mexico and
the US see 3DES support with 31.4% and 42.6% of domestic servers,
respectively.
While few countries house servers that offer significant support
for DES40 and DES56, a majority of nations support 3DES ciphers
with over 40% of domestic servers, leading to a global percentage
of 40.5% of IPs accepting TLS handshakes negotiated with a DES
encryption algorithm. As seen by our reverse DNS aggregation in
Table 1 (listed in the Appendix), many, if not most, of these servers
appear to be owned by companies and organizations offering var-
ious Internet services. Lastly, popular websites seem to support
fewer DES ciphers than the Internet in general, with 34% of IPs
accepting a DES cipher.
5 DISCUSSION
It is evident that DES ciphers are still supported by many IPs, rang-
ing from data hosting services to telecommunications providers to
news organizations and more. 3DES algorithms are easily the most
frequently supported deprecated ciphersuites, likely due to the re-
cent deprecation of 3DES, whereas DES56 has been deprecated for
over a decade and sees relatively less support.
Outdated infrastructure has been cited as a potential reason for
continued support of deprecated systems, but we do not find strong
correlations between the frequency in support (or quality of) DES
ciphers and the stage of development of a country.
5.1 Limitations
Though we were able to quickly perform handshakes with servers
in a span of six months, the nature of our study could not cap-
ture longitudinal data, and Censys data on responsive IPs quickly
became outdated. Due to the Internet’s rapid and dynamic charac-
terization, many hosts that were online during a Censys scan were
not reachable by our queries. Several servers that we attempted to
query resulted in connection and I/O timeouts that might affect
the validity of our findings. As such, though we observed 40.5% of
IP addresses accepting some form of DES cipher, it is possible that
percentage has fluctuated some as TLS versions are upgraded or
old hosts are reintroduced to the network.
Lastly, while we were able to successfully query over 31 million
unique IP addresses on a global scale, our initial ambitions were
to explore the entire TLS space of about 41 million servers. As
discussed in Section 2, active scanning requires significantly more
computational overhead and bandwidth. We needed to make 36 TLS
handshakes per IP address to comprehensively analyze use of DES

and networks with requests, we necessarily obtain relatively lower
throughput than other approaches.
5.2 Future Work
Future work will expand the dataset of sampled IP addresses in
order to more accurately gauge global support for DES, especially
in countries where there were few reported IP addresses. Future
scans will provide a longitudinal perspective on deprecated cipher
support, supplementing existing knowledge of DES use over time.
In addition, we will examine the TLS fingerprint of servers that
support DES in order to determine the types of machines, configu-
rations, and packages that typically support DES ciphers.
6 RELATED WORK
Holz et al. [23] scanned a large number of popular HTTPS servers
for X.509 certificates analysis, revealing a lack of stringent cer-
tification. The ICSI SSL notary [5] provides passive scanning on
SSL/TLS connections from universities and research institutes in
North America. ZMap [19] enables fast Internet scanning by leverag-
ing optimized probing, eliminating per-connection state, and avoid-
ing retransmissions. Durumeric et al. [18] conducted a large-scale
study of the Heartbleed vulnerability’s impact involving 150K hosts,
demonstrating the dynamics of workflow patching. Censys [17]
performs active, periodic Internet-wide TLS scans by leveraging
ZMap, but does not provide a list of offered ciphersuites by server.
Holz et al. [22] scanned TLS use, focusing on application protocols
such as IMAP, IRC, XMPP, etc. SSL pulse [32] provides coarse sta-
tistics of SSL/TLS quality for Alexa’s most popular websites, but do
not give details on weak ciphers (except RC4), and only cover 150K
machines/websites. Recently, Kotzias et al. [27] showed the evolu-
tion of TLS ciphersuite use over the last six years, reporting fewer
than 1% of connections use DES-related ciphersuites, but without
considering available server ciphersuites. To our knowledge, our
work is the first Internet-wide active scan for TLS with a focus on
DES-based ciphersuite use, covering over 31 million unique IPv4
addresses. We discuss attacks against TLS in the Appendix.

We scanned over 31 million IPv4 addresses half a year after 3DES
