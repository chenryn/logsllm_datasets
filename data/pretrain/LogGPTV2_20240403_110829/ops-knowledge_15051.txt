User: I have been looking for a solution for my app that does not seem to be directly discussed anywhere. My goal is to publish an app and have it reach out, automatically, to a server I am working with. This just needs to be a simple Post. I have everything working fine, and am currently solving this problem with a cron job, but it is not quite sufficient - I would like the job to execute automatically once the app has been published, not after a minute (or whichever the specified time it may be set to).
In concept I am trying to have my app register itself with my server and to do this I'd like for it to run once on publish and never be ran again.
Is there a solution to this problem? I have looked at Task Queues and am unsure if it is what I am looking for.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.
Assistant: Personally, this makes more sense to me as a responsibility of your deploy process, rather than of the app itself. If you have your own deploy script, add the post request there (after a successful deploy). If you use google's command line tools, you could wrap that in a script. If you use a 3rd party tool for something like continuous integration, they probably have deploy hooks you could use for this purpose.
