Subject: Seeking a Solution for Automatic Server Registration Upon App Publication

Dear Support Team,

I am currently developing an application and am in need of a specific solution that I have not been able to find through my research. My objective is to enable my app to automatically send a simple POST request to a designated server upon publication, thereby registering the app with the server. While I have successfully implemented this functionality using a cron job, it does not fully meet my requirements as the job executes at set intervals (e.g., every minute) rather than immediately after the app has been published.

Ideally, I would like this registration process to occur only once, right after the app is published, and never again. I have explored Task Queues as a potential solution but am uncertain if they are suitable for my needs. 

Could you please provide guidance on how to achieve this? Any assistance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for reaching out and providing such a clear description of your requirement. It makes more sense to handle this task as part of your deployment process rather than within the app itself. Here are a few approaches you can consider:

1. **Custom Deployment Script:**
   - If you use a custom deployment script, you can add a step to make the POST request to your server immediately after a successful deployment. This ensures the request is made exactly once and at the right time.

2. **Google Cloud Command Line Tools:**
   - If you use Google Cloud's command line tools, you can wrap the deployment command in a script that includes the POST request. For example:
     ```sh
     gcloud app deploy
     curl -X POST -d "your_data" http://your-server-url
     ```

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools:**
   - Many CI/CD platforms, such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions, offer post-deployment hooks or webhooks. You can configure these tools to trigger the POST request as part of the deployment pipeline.

By integrating the POST request into your deployment process, you ensure that it is executed precisely when needed, without relying on the app or a cron job.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions or need more detailed instructions, feel free to ask.
