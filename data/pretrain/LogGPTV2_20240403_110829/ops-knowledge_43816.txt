User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Corporate IT monitoring and access to user private data (keylogging? https data transmission?) I work at a large company that requires employees to sign a digital certification saying that we recognize the right of the said company to monitor all data and communication on our work laptops, and that anything we do on the computer should have no expectation of privacy. 

What I wonder is, as far as standard enterprise IT security software goes, how omnipotent and omniscient is the IT department likely to be in monitoring user data?

Two specific questions:


I store all my log in passwords (everything in life) on an excel spreadsheet, and password protect this spreadsheet. I understand that my company will have access to a copy of this spreadsheet since it's on my computer. But how likely is it that they can access its contents, perhaps using a keylogger to get the password for the spreadsheet, or screen capturing when I have the spreadsheet open with all the passwords shown?
I use my gmail at work. It's https enabled. Is IT likely able to see all the emails I send and receive, even though it's through https?


Again, I believe our company uses a standard enterprise security tool, so wanted to see if anyone knowledgeable can shed insight on how much of my personal data can be freely accessed by the IT department.

Thank you.

Assistant: Ultimately if you are using a computer controlled by someone other than you (in this case your employer) they can get access to anything you process on that computer, including e-mails, passwords and pretty much anything else.

Whether they do or not is a different question. Depending on your location there may be legislation limiting what they can legally do (e.g the Data Protection Act and Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act in the United Kingdom).

Generally speaking I would say it would be unusual for a company to put key-stroke logging on their staff machines, unless perhaps that staff member is under investigation for something, even then the legality of that could be dubious.

On the Internet interception, it's possible (e.g. using something like bluecoat) for them to see inside SSL connections, but that doesn't mean they're looking at the content of your mails for anything other than malware...

I'd say that if you're not sure that you trust them to have this access the best option would be to only make use of your own computing devices for your personal activities.
