**User:**
I would like to install Jupyter Notebook on my MacBook Pro (OS X El Capitan) and my web server (Debian 7). However, I encounter the same error on both systems: "jupyter notebook is not a jupyter command." I followed the official installation instructions, and there were no errors during the installation process. I have searched for solutions, but none of them have worked. What should I do now?

**Assistant:**
I encountered the same problem when using the Fish shell. When I switched to the Bash shell, everything worked correctly.
