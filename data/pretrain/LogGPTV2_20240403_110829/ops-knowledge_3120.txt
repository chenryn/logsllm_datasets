User: I want to have jupyter notebook installed. But on my MacBook Pro (OS X El Capitan) and my web server (Debian 7), I get the same error: jupyter notebook is not a jupyter command. 
I just follow the official installation instruction. And no error occurs during installation. 
I searched for solutions but none of them works. What should I do now?
Assistant: I meet withe the same problem when I use fish,when I switch to bash,everything works well!
