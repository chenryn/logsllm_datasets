I find the reliance on conda in the Ubuntu development environment quickstart
guide exceedingly complex, not to mention the need to rename `libgfortran.so`,
but I guess that those instructions are there for a good reason (historical
pain setting up development environments, messed up Python installations...
and other incarnations of Evil ™️ ). However, I tried this on a modern Linux
Mint 20 box (based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa) and this seemed to work
just fine:
    $ # create and activate pyenv/venv/virtualenv environment
    (venv) $ pip install -e .
    (venv) $ pip install numpy  # Surprisingly, NumPy didn't get installed in this step
    (venv) $ pip install pytest
    (venv) $ pytest -k optimize  # Works!
Is there any potential drawback in following this method?
