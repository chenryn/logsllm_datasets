Assistant: This log chunk shows that the system is attempting to renew a lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1] and is also attempting to contact the RM server at msra-sa-41:8030. The system is also detecting address changes from msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170 to msra-sa-41. However, the system is unable to renew the lease or contact the RM server, and is retrying with a fixed sleep time of 1000 milliseconds.
