### Summary of the Log Chunk

The provided log chunk, consisting of 20 lines, documents a series of events related to address changes, lease renewal failures, and connection retries in a Hadoop environment. Here is a step-by-step summary:

1. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple WARN logs indicate that the system detected an address change for both the `RMCommunicator Allocator` (port 8030) and the `LeaseRenewer` (port 9000). The old address was `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:port`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:port`.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component failed to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times. Each failure is logged with an increasing duration (from 151 seconds to 155 seconds). The system indicates that it will retry shortly after each failure.

3. **Connection Retries to RM Server**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is attempting to connect to the Resource Manager (RM) server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. Each attempt is logged with an INFO message, indicating that the system is retrying the connection. The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`.
   - Following each retry attempt, an ERROR log is generated, stating "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM," indicating that the connection attempts are failing.

### Key Points
- **Address Change**: The system detects and logs address changes for both the RM server and the LeaseRenewer.
- **Lease Renewal**: The LeaseRenewer fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` repeatedly, with the duration of the failure increasing over time.
- **Connection Retry**: The RMCommunicator Allocator is unable to connect to the RM server, and the system is retrying the connection with a fixed sleep time of 1 second between attempts.

### Conclusion
The log indicates ongoing issues with address changes, lease renewal, and connectivity to the RM server. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the stability and functionality of the Hadoop environment.
