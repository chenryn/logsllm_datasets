When running Webpack, I encountered the following error. This configuration has been working without issues until now:

```
ERROR in ./index.js
Module build failed: Error: Final loader didn't return a Buffer or String

```

The error message indicates that the final loader in the chain did not return a `Buffer` or `String`, which is required by Webpack. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
1. Ensure that all loaders in your Webpack configuration are up to date.
2. Check the version compatibility between Webpack and the loaders.
3. Verify that the `babel-loader` (or any other relevant loader) is correctly configured.
4. Review the code in `./index.js` for any recent changes that might be causing the issue.

If the problem persists, please provide more details about your Webpack configuration and the specific versions of the tools you are using.
