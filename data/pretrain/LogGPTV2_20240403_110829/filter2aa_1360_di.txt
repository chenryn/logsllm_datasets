This partial template includes explicit details located during my investigation. I do not cite any sources, and I 
use this as an easy reference for account information that someone may use later. On some investigations, the 
Suspect Details section is several pages. After I have completed my Executive Summary and Suspect Details, I 
write the report narrative. The following are two small portions of how this report might appear. Note that I 
already possess screen captures of all online evidence, titled as previously explained.
The previous example provided just enough detail to give an overall synopsis of the case. Most clients will not 
read past this page until necessary. They may thumb through the entire report and look at any screen captures, 
but ultimately, they possess the information they need. Obviously, you still need to provide your evidence, which 
is what we will do in the next portion of the report. I use a specific "Suspect Details" template, but you should 
create your own that best represents your needs. Consider my example below.

Of these messages, 1 found three references to the suspect and his doctor participating in a hunting trip. These

Investigation Number: 2017-54887 
Investigator: Michael Bazzell
On November 17, 2017,1 was assigned an investigation into potential fraudulent medical claims made by John 
Davis, a former employee of INSERT COMPANY HERE. The following represents a detailed summary of my 
findings.
Note that I did not place a screen capture of this evidence within the report itself. There are two main reasons 
I do not place screen captures within printed report text. First, I believe it is better to keep the report concise 
and clutter-free. The client can easily view the evidence within the provided disc or drive. Second, it can be quite 
difficult to include an entire screen capture within an 8 ’/z x 11 page. I would likely need to crop any images, 
which also means that I am redacting evidence. I would rather my client view the digital screen capture which 
displays the entire page. If I do want to include printed online screen captures, 1 will do so at the end of the 
report, and as a supplement. Also notice that after each set of screen captures, I summarized the value. In this 
example, the most beneficial evidence was a specific image. I have found that presenting the client with every 
possible detail results in an overwhelming report. I believe it is our job to tell the client what he or she may care 
about relevant to the case. After all, we are the analysts. Anyone can collect a bunch of screenshots. The true 
value is understanding why these captures are important In the next example, I outline findings on Twitter.
Most notable within these captures is the "Photos" section identifying photos associated with hunting, including 
images with both Mr. Davis and his doctor within the same photo. This specific evidence is titled as follows.
I located the Twitter profile of the suspect’s daughter, Kylie Davis, at twitter.com/kdavis722. I exported the 
most recent 3,200 posts (Tweets), and saved this as kdavis722.csv on the attached disc. 1 found the messages 
between Kylie Davis and Patricia Stevens (pstevens6655) of most interest. I isolated these messages with the 
following two queries.
• Online evidence proves a personal association between the suspect and his doctor.
498 Chapter 30
• Online pictorial evidence proves the suspect to have been physically fit enough to lift heavy objects 
within the time period of the disability claim.
• Online evidence proves the suspect to be able to hunt in rugged conditions within the time period of 
the disability claim.
This investigation was conducted with the hopes of identifying the participation of medical fraud by the suspect. 
1 believe that this claim of fraud has been proven true. 1 advise continuous monitoring until the workman's 
comp claim is setded. Specifically, this investigation reveals the following as fact.
• 
Executive Summary: One-page synopsis of vital evidence.
• 
Suspect Details: Specific data such as all personal identifiers, usernames, etc.
• 
Narrative Report: Detailed findings with references to digital evidence and summaries.
• 
Summary Report: One-page summary of facts and need for future work.
• 
Digital Evidence: A DVD or drive that contains all screen captures and files.
Note that 1 included details of the search technique, the specific evidence files, and information as to the 
importance of the content. I like to be as brief as possible. The digital screen captures provide all of the evidence 
necessary’, and explicit detail of each capture is overkill. In most investigations, 1 have several pages of this type 
of narrative. Finally, I include a one-page Summary’ Report at the end. This also identifies future investigation 
needs and whether the incident is resolved. The following is a partial example.
Note that I did not make any claims I could not prove, and I did not inject much opinion into the matter. I 
always try’ to keep the reports factual and unbiased. If I locate any’ online evidence that supports the suspect, I 
include it as well. When this happens, I make sure to emphasize this with digital screen captures and a brief 
summary’ of the content Overall, I tty to include the following with each report.
This verbiage announces your competence to the prosecution and defense. It may stop some scrutiny toward 
your work during a trial or hearing. Ultimately, it shows that you conducted your investigation fairly’ with great 
concern for the integrity of your evidence. Additionally, this may’ make y’ou stand out to your supervisors or the 
office of prosecution. I have found that consistent dedication to accurate reporting can go a long way toward 
your reputation and promotions.
This chapter has presented many reporting options, some of which may' contradict the others. Your reports may 
be extremely complex and contain dozens of pages, or consist only’ of the executive summary’. My’ goal here was
This entire investigation was conducted within a Linux virtual machine. This operating system was created on 
(insert date) and saved as an original copy. All security updates were applied at that time and no online 
investigation was conducted within this original copy. A clone of this sy’stem was created and tided (case 
number). This clone was used as the only’ operating system resource for the entire investigation. No other 
investigations were conducted within this clone. At the end of the investigation, this virtual machine was 
exported as (file name). This file can be used to recreate the entire investigation environment exactly as it 
appeared during the actual investigation.
Online evidence proves the suspect to have been physically’ fit enough to run 5 kilometers within 28 
minutes within the time period of the disability claim.
As stated previously, I believe that every’ OSINT investigation should be conducted within a virtual machine. 
At the end of the investigation, the entire machine should be exported as a single digital file and included with 
the digital evidence. I would also consider including the following paragraph within your narrative report.

First, I need an unlocked mobile device. This will never be used outside of the investigation or for any p 
use. I usually buy refurbished Android devices at local cell phone repair shops for $20 each. These b

the phones and service with prepaid gift cards or Privacy.com virtual cards.
I insert the SIM into the device; download the Mint Mobile application over Wi-Fi; register an account

Large-Scale Continuous Investigations
Many of my' investigations span weeks or months. Most are extremely sensitive and must possess c ^ent 
isolation from any other investigations. This goes beyond a clean virtual machine. They deman Jetcct

will save time and energy’. Everyone's reports are unique, and you should find the best way to

findings to an audience of any technical level. It is now your mission to identify the best documenta 
reporting practices for your needs. 1 close this chapter with one final consideration for your ne 
investigation. The following explains how to isolate a burner SIM card with a cellular data acc 
prepared to disclose our information.
I can also place applications on the device when an emulator is not appropriate. As an example, Snapchat and 
Tinder usually block Genymotion and other virtual Android environments. With this device, I can install the 
native apps, launch a GPS spoofer, and conduct my investigation without roadblocks. My' device appears real 
and I bypass scrutiny from the providers.
At the end of the investigation, I remove the SIM and place it and the phone in a sealable plastic bag with holes 
punched for use in a binder. These can be found in any’ office supply’ store. The phone and SIM are part of the 
investigation. The sen-ice will expire on its own and I have a clean digital trail. If necessary’, 1 can provide the 
device and account details as part of discovery’ in court. I have no concerns if an expert witness wants to clone 
the machine for their own analysis. If the number should become exposed in a data breach, it is not a problem. 
It will never be used again. If you plan to replicate this technique, I advise preparing now. You do not want to 
be shopping for a device and waiting for delivery’ of a SIM card while you should be investigating your target.

reasonable measures and intent to limit access
Most organizations place online investigations policies within a section covering the overall social media policies. 
That section is usually broken down into a statement of intent, social media definitions, official use, personal 
use, and finally investigative use. I believe that operationally it makes more sense to group online investigations 
policies under the "Investigations,, section of your agency manual. This is consistent with our argument that 
purpose and use should drive policy, rather than platform. Open source intelligence gathering is just another 
form of lawful investigation and we want to align it as such. An online undercover operation should be 
conducted and scrutinized in a manner similar to a covert assignment on the street Comparing online 
investigative procedures with how the agency might use social media for public relations makes little sense and 
yet most organizations group them together.
Avoid using language tied to specific technologies or platforms, as those will change rapidly over time. In-house 
council may request language pertaining to Facebook or another specific third-party' platform. They may 
recommend building policy around specific tools or technologies. It is our responsibility to demonstrate how 
the rapid changes in technology' will make such a policy ineffective and almost immediately irrelevant. Moreover, 
limitations imposed by' overly specific regulations will likely confine us to difficult options.
There is much controversy over the use of social media and personal data for investigative purposes. Therefore, 
it is critical that your organization has a clear and concise technical investigations policy' in place. This should be 
a one or two-page document and it must include at a minimum a training standard, an approval process, and an 
appropriate use policy.
[This statement articulates the importance of establishing guidelines for 
appropriate use of online accounts, services, and software for the purpose of 
online criminal investigations. It should be brief and reflect the mission 
statement of your organization. Consider borrowing language from existing 
policies related to appropriate investigative tactics.]
I believe that for most agencies an online investigations policy' should be no longer than two pages. The 
following is the basic framework for an appropriately' non-specific policy. The statement of intent and definition 
sub-sections may' be omitted if those are addressed within your general social media regulations.
Responsible investigative policy' should focus on the appropriate use of techniques and technologies. Review 
and borrow heavily from the mission statement and boilerplate language that your organization already applies 
to traditional investigative procedures. Any existing policy relating to training, equipment, enforcement, 
supervision, or chain of custody will have language that will fold easily into the framework of your online 
investigations policy.

For smaller teams or organizations lacking an official policy structure, an alternative format could be a set of 
standard operating procedures (SOPs). The content will be essentially the same, but less formal in structure. 
Take the previous policy example, delete the definitions and headings, and paste the remaining content into your 
agency's memorandum template. Then, have it approved by a commander or manager higher in rank than the 
front-line supervisor. The important thing is to have some type of documented standard for these types of 
investigations. Eventually a controversial incident or high-profile case will expose your team to scrutiny and a 
well-structured policy will go a long way to demonstrating transparency and professionalism.
