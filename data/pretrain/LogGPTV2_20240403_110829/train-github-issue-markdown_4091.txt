Following the lead of #13058 towards smaller, more focused, sub repositories,
I would like to propose the creation of a sub repo for packages related to
handling the interaction with tty like things. This includes
  * posix ttys and ptys
  * serial termios control, like terminals and rs232 devices.
  * windows cmd console
Much of the code for this exists in various packages, some in other sub repos
like x/crypto/ssh/terminal, others has been duplicated incompletely by package
authors with a specific use case; most times without a comprehensive story for
windows.
Various informal proposal have been made, like #12853, relating to posix
termios.
Other proposals like #12101 for the creation of an x/sys/terminal group of
packages have been rejected on the grounds that sys is too low level, which
also dovetails into the desire for more smaller sub repos, rather than larger
ones.
There is also the the long standing question of why the code to disable
terminal echo lives in the x/crypto/ssh package.
With the exception of the _name_ of the repository, which I'm sure will
require debate, is there general support for a sub repository along the lines
outlined in this proposal ?
