### Techniques Discussed
Most of the techniques covered are not highly sophisticated and can be countered by an experienced investigator. The primary goal is to increase the time and cost of the investigation, thereby increasing the likelihood of a settlement. Advanced methods like hard drive wiping and steganography, which have been around for decades, will not be discussed.

### Typical Methodologies
1. **Copy First, Ask Questions Later**
   - Commonly used by law enforcement.
   - Copy the entire hard drive and then assess relevance.

2. **Assess Relevance First, Then Copy**
   - Used by all types of investigators.
   - Search the hard drive for specific keywords and copy only relevant data.

3. **Remote Analysis of Live System**
   - Typically used by enterprise companies on their employees.
   - Analyze the live system remotely and copy targeted evidence only.

### Typical Workflow
1. **Create Working Copy**
   - Image the HDD or copy files remotely for analysis.

2. **Process Data for Analysis**
   - Hash files, analyze signatures, and filter out known files (De-NIST/De-NSRL).

3. **Separate Wheat from Chaff**
   - Conduct keyword searches and identify useful files.

4. **Analyze Data for Relevance**
   - Review photos, documents, spreadsheets, and export files for native analysis.
   - Bookmark, flag, or list useful items.

5. **Prepare Report on Findings**
   - Include thumbnails, snapshots, and snippets.
   - Write up procedures and attach appendices and lists.

6. **Archive Data for Future Use**
   - Store images on a central NAS and shelve HDDs for future reference.

### Classic Anti-Forensic Techniques
- **HDD Scrubbing / File Wiping**: Overwriting disk areas repeatedly.
- **Encryption**: Using tools like TrueCrypt and PGP.
- **Physical Destruction**: Destroying the physical storage media.

These methods are rarely used in practice as they imply guilt and can be addressed without technical measures.

### Running Tallies
- **Bottom Left**: Hours wasted
- **Bottom Right**: Dollars spent
- **Rate Assumption**: $300/hour for the digital investigator’s time

### Technique #1: Create a Working Copy
#### Confounding the First Stage
- **Data Saturation**: Own a lot of media and use each device/container regularly.
- **Mitigation**: Parallelize the acquisition process using multiple drive duplicators. Use the suspect's hardware to boot from a CD and mount an external USB HDD.

### Technique #2: Non-Standard RAID
- **Non-Standard Settings**: Use uncommon stripe sizes, orders, and endianness.
- **Mitigation**: De-RAID volumes on the attacker’s own system using boot discs. If the RAID controller doesn’t support Linux, use Windows-Live CDs.

### Technique #3: Process Data for Analysis
- **File Signature Masking**: Hollow out a file and store data inside, or encode data within a binary file.
- **Mitigation**: Use fuzzy hashing to identify similar but not identical files. Analyze recent file lists for curious entries.

### Technique #4: Separate Wheat from Chaff
- **NSRL Scrubbing**: Modify system and program files to avoid NSRL matches.
- **Mitigation**: Use a whitelist approach to search for useful files rather than eliminating useless ones.

### Technique #5: Scrambled MACE Times
- **Scrambling Timestamps**: Randomize file timestamps and BIOS time.
- **Mitigation**: Ignore metadata dates and look for log files that write dates as strings. Identify sets of similar times to infer mini timelines.

By understanding and mitigating these anti-forensic techniques, investigators can more effectively manage the challenges of digital investigations.
