users typically view before quitting.
For VOD content, Figure 10a shows that based on the fraction
of video that a user viewed within a session, users can be classiﬁed
into three categories:
• Early-quitter: A large fraction of the users watch less than
10% of the video before quitting the sessions. These users
might be “sampling" the video.
• Drop-out: We observe that further on, users steadily drop out
of the video session possibly due to quality issues or lack of
interest in the content.
video to completion.
• Steady viewer: A signiﬁcant fraction of the users watch the
We can model this using a mixture model with three separate com-
ponents [33]. As shown in Figures 10b and 10c, we try to ﬁnd the
best ﬁtting probability distribution for the early-quitter and steady
viewer components. Inspecting visually and using mean squared
error test, we choose the gamma distribution to represent both the
early-quitter and the steady viewer components. We model the
drop-out component using a uniform distribution. We then use ex-
pectation maximization [33] to estimate the mixture model param-
eters and obtain the model as shown in Figure 10a. These models
can be used for simulating video viewing behaviors in the future.
The previous result considers the behavior of users in aggregate.
A natural question then is whether speciﬁc users behave in a con-
sistent way across multiple video sessions. To this end, we proﬁle
users’ viewing history across multiple sessions by grouping ses-
sions by the user as identiﬁed using their unique ClientID. We ﬁnd
that 4.5% of the users quit the session early for more than 75% of
the sessions; i.e., these users are “serial" early quitters. Similarly,
16.6% of the users consistently viewed the video to completion;
i.e., these are consistently steady viewers.
Similar to the analysis that we did for VOD content, we also
analyze what fraction of the live content users typically view be-
fore quitting and plot the distribution in Figure 11a. We observe
that based on the fraction of video viewed within a session, users
watching live content can be classiﬁed into two categories:
• Early-quitter: A very large fraction of users watch less than
• Drop-out: The remaining fraction of users steadily drop out of

the video session.
Figure 11b zooms into the early-quitter part of the plot and shows
how well different distributions ﬁt the data. Inspecting visually and
using mean squared error test, we ﬁnd that the gamma distribution
is the best ﬁt and model it in Figure 11a. A large fraction of users
quitting the session early for live content might imply that the ﬁrst
part of the event is the most popular part. However, as we see in
Figure 11c users arrive randomly within the event and stay for short
periods of time before quitting. Hence the ﬁrst part of the event is
not necessarily the most popular part.
We also proﬁle users’ viewing history (based on the unique Client
ID) and notice that around 20.7% of the clients are “serial" early
quitters—i.e., they quit the session early for more than 75% of the
sessions for live content. We also observe several users joining and
quitting multiple times during the same event. Since our dataset
consists of sporting events, one possibility is that they might be
checking for the current score of the match.
Contrasting the observations of live and VOD, we observe the
following key differences:
• The early-quitters watch higher fractions of video in the case of
live (up to 20% of the video) when compared to VOD (up to
10% of the video). Drop-out percentage is less pronounced in
the case of live and we also do not observe a signiﬁcant fraction
of users viewing the entire event.
• In the case of VOD, users typically view the video from the start
as opposed to live where people join at random times.

Implications:
(1) This analysis is particularly relevant in the context of augment-
ing CDNs with P2P based delivery. For example, if most users are
likely to only watch a small fraction of video, then P2P will be less
effective at ofﬂoading some of the server load as there may not be
sufﬁcient number of cached copies of the content.
(2) Content providers and content delivery infrastructures can iden-
tify the early quitters and steady viewers and customize the alloca-
tion of resources (e.g., use P2P to serve the content to early quitters
who are “sampling" the video).
(3) Although user behavior like early-quitting are similar for live
and VOD, we need to consider the differences in access patterns.
For example, since early-quitters watch the video for longer in the
case of live, employing P2P to serve early-quitters might imply
serving more content using P2P in the case of live than VOD.
(4) Similarly, the fact that users typically view VOD objects from
the start and quit early might imply higher availability for the ﬁrst
few chunks of the video. For live, even though users quit quickly,
they arrive randomly in between the event and hence the ﬁrst part
of the event may not necessarily be the most popular part.
(5) Beyond hybrid P2P designs, this analysis is very interesting be-
cause understanding such patterns is especially useful for content
providers and content delivery infrastructures in order to maximize
some higher-level objective (e.g., where to place ad impressions to
maximize revenue).
5.1.2 Evolution of interest
It is crucial to investigate how popularity of content evolves over
time since it could point to certain times when P2P strategies might
be more beneﬁcial. For example, if more users watch VOD videos
on the day of release, there would be higher synchrony in viewer-
ship that could lead to higher beneﬁts from employing P2P.
We classify VOD objects into three categories: TV series, news
show or reality show and model the evolution in interest along two
key dimensions: (1) temporal decay in popularity for a given object
(i.e., a ﬁxed episode for a ﬁxed show) over days, and (2) demand
predictability across multiple episodes for a given show. We de-
velop models for these parameters that can be used for simulating
video workloads in the future. Live objects are viewed while the
event is happening and are not available afterwards. Hence, we ex-
plore how the interest in the content evolves during the event by
analyzing hotspot points in events.
Figure 12 shows the temporal variation in popularity and how
demand for the content decays for sample objects from the three
categories of VOD objects. First, for TV series episodes, the de-
mand for episodes appears relatively stable and predictable week to
week, and it decays gradually over time. Second, for news shows,
we see the demand hits a peak on the release date and decreases
quite dramatically. Finally, for reality shows, while we see a de-
cay in demand from the time of release, there is less predictable
viewership across different episodes. We further characterize the
temporal decay and demand predictability for VOD objects.

that the highest number of accesses occurs on the day of release for

all the VOD objects, and the daily peak number of access for each
object decreases with time. Exponential decay appears to be the
best ﬁt for modeling the decay (compared to linear decay process)
based on aggregate mean-squared error test across multiple objects.
The decay in peak number of accesses can hence be characterized
using an exponential decay function as follows:
P (t) = P0e  t
(8)
where P0 is the peak number of access on the day of release, P (t)
is the peak number of access on the day t since release and   is the
decay constant. Figure 13 shows the CDF of the estimated decay
rate ( ) for all the VOD objects categorized by their genres. News
shows have high decay rates which implies that these objects turn
stale quicker and their demand decreases dramatically within a day
of release.
In contrast, TV shows have lower decay rates. The
decay rate of reality shows have more variability.
Demand predictability for VOD objects: We analyze how pre-
dictable the demand for shows are based on their viewership his-
tory. For this, we use the viewership pattern of the latest episode
as an estimate for the next episode.3 We characterize (1) how close
were the peak number of accesses on the day of release? (2) how
similar were the decay patterns?
(1) Estimation Error: Using the most recent episode as a predic-
tor for the peak demand for the next episode, we calculate:
Estimation error = |Pactual   Pestimated|
Pactual
(9)
where Pactual is the peak number of accesses on the day of release
of the show and Pestimated is the estimated peak number of accesses
3Our dataset is limited to 2 to 4 episodes per show. Modeling view-
ership history over a larger span is an interesting direction for future
work.
(b) Cosine Similarity
Figure 14: Characterizing demand predictability
(i.e., the peak number of accesses observed for the previous show
in the series). Figure 14a shows the CDF of relative error for dif-
ferent genres. We observe that TV series have lower relative error
values, implying that their peak access rates across episodes are
more steady and predictable. News shows and reality shows tend
to have more variable peak accesses.
(2) Cosine similarity: Apart from categorizing the predictabil-
ity of the peak number of accesses, we also want to estimate how
similar the decay patterns are across episodes within a series. If
X = denotes the vector of the number of
accesses for the object starting from the hour of release and Y = denote the vector of number of accesses for the
previous episode of the series, we compute the similarity between
the episodes as:

high similarity and 0 indicates independence.4 Figure 14b shows
the CDF of cosine similarity for different VOD objects. We observe
that TV series have the highest similarity. The access patterns of
news shows tend to be very different from the previous episodes.
The cosine similarity of reality shows falls in between the TV series
and news shows.
Hotspots in live events: From a provisioning perspective, it is im-
portant to understand how the interest in the content evolves during
the live event. Figure 15 gives two extreme examples of how overall
interest in the content changes within a session. Figure 15a shows
an example of an event where the number of viewers watching the
event was steady throughout the event whereas Figure 15b is an ex-
ample of an event where there was a particular point in the event
where interest peaked and then it died down. We refer to the loca-
tion with the peak number of simultaneous viewers as the hotspot
point within the event.
Given these extremes, a natural question is what does a typical
live event look like? To this end, we systematically analyze the live
events on two dimensions: (1) where do hotspots occur in a video?
(2) how pronounced is the hotspot? Figure 16a shows the CDF of
the hotspot point location for all the live events. We see that there
is no particular location where hotspots typically occur. To cap-
ture how pronounced a hotspot is, we compute the peak-to-average
ratio of the number of simultaneous viewers at a given point of
time during the session. Looking at the distribution of the peak-to-
average ratio (Figure 16b), we observe that majority of the events
have ﬂat access rates (similar to Figure 15a). However, events with
pronounced hotspots tend to have the hotspot point towards the be-
ginning of the event.
Implications:
(1) The strong diurnal patterns observed from the time series plots
again point to high synchrony of viewing even at a per-object ba-
sis. This bodes favorably in using P2P augmentation strategies for
delivering VOD content.
(2) The decay rates indicate higher synchronous viewing behavior
on the day of release of the show. This is also when we see higher
demand in objects and when the CDNs might beneﬁt more from
using P2P strategies.
(3) Comparing genres, news shows have very high decay rates and
are least predictable. This could potentially lead to sudden unex-
pected surges in demands and hence CDNs may need to invoke
P2P-based strategies dynamically to handle these loads. However,
TV series have more stable demands that are predictable and with
lower decay. This means that the delivery infrastructure can be pro-
visioned accordingly. Reality shows have much more variability in
terms of decay and predictability.
(4) Since we do not observe any typical pattern for hotspot loca-
tions across live objects, CDNs may need to dynamically invoke
strategies to handle the peak loads by using P2P depending on how
interest evolves for the particular content.
5.2 Revisiting P2P-CDN beneﬁts
Contrary to the conventional wisdom in this space, ﬁrst, we posit
that P2P might be more useful for VOD than previously assumed
and that these beneﬁts can be achieved even without assuming that
each peer is caching the whole content as in [27]. Second, the pres-
ence of early quitters suggest CDNs may want to rethink how they
allocate constrained server resources. Speciﬁcally, we leverage the
higher interest in the early chunks coupled with the tendency of

users to sample videos to consider a (possibly counter-intuitive)
option where we can use P2P to bootstrap serving the content and
later use the CDN servers. This allows the CDN to invest resources
more usefully for viewers who are more likely to yield increased
revenue from ad-impressions.
