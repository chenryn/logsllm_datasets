# Description
I am using celery 4.3, and according to it's documentation, the class based
tasks are not registered automatically (or autodiscovered) they have to be
registered manually :
https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/3.0/whatsnew-4.0.html#the-task-base-class-
no-longer-automatically-register-tasks. But I see all class based tasks are
getting registered in my case automatically. And now when I upgraded to celery
5.1.*, now the class based tasks are not getting registered. So in which
version exactly this feature is removed?
