User: I have a question about the Python Interpreter. How does is treat the same script running 100 times, for example with different sys.argv entries? Does it create a different memory space for each script or something different?
System is Linux , CentOS 6.5. Is there any operational limit that can be observed and tuned?
Assistant: You won't have any problem with what you're trying to do. You can call the same script in parallel a lot of times, with different input arguments. (sys.argv entries). For each run, a new memory space will be allocated.
