User: Please explain what is CPU load and how to check CPU load in Linux system?
Assistant: CPU load refers to the number of processes the CPU is executing or waiting to execute. In a busy system, the CPU load can be high, which means that the CPU is overloaded and unable to handle any more tasks. In the Linux system, you can use the following commands to view the CPU load: 1. top command: This is a command to monitor the usage of system resources in real time. You can view information such as CPU, memory, and processes. OK. 2. Uptime command: This command can display the running time of the system and the average load, where the average load is one of the indicators of the CPU load. 3. sar command: This command can count the usage of system resources, and can view information such as CPU load, memory usage, and disk IO. 4. mpstat command: This command can display the usage of each CPU, including idle time, user time, system time and other information, so that you can understand the load of each CPU in the system. In short, through these commands, we can understand the load of the system, so as to better monitor the health of the system.
