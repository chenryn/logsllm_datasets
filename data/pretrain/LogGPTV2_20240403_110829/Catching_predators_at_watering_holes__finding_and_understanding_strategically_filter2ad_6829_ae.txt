the second watering hole attack on RSF-chinese.org: the ﬁrst one
happened in 2012.
Politically motivated campaign. Along with the 2014 Hong Kong
protests, a series of sit-in protests in Hong Kong involving mass
civil disobedience [15], a remarkable number of political and me-
dia websites became prime targets of watering hole attacks in late
2014 and as such we added them to the list of websites to moni-
Figure 1: Politically motivated campaign. The red domains are new unre-
ported watering holes.
tor, described in Section 3.2. Such an attempt proved fruitful as we
were able to ﬁnd many of these websites to be strategically compro-
mised. Starting from one water holed website, namely adpl.org.hk,
we extracted its Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and performed
a recursive search for them within our dataset, which enabled us
to discover 6 new watering holes through URL patterns, malicious
payload injection method and cookies used as shown in Figure 1.
Speciﬁcally, in our dataset, adpl.org.hk, a website for the asso-
ciation for democracy and people’s livelihood, was detected and
conﬁrmed to have been compromised twice. The ﬁrst appeared in
2014 and served a malicious payload from macanna.com.tw which
was also used to provide malicious payloads on archive.dphk.org,
the site for the Democratic Party of Hong Kong. Additionally, the
scripts used attempted to write the cookie gougou=Somethinggggg
which was also used in the compromise of hkba.org, the Hong
Kong Bar Association site. In our discovered watering hole attacks,
cookies were extensively used to keep track of the victims and
avoid serving malicious payloads multiple times to evade detec-
tion, because, by design, strategically selected sites are frequented
by the same visitors.
The second compromise on adpl.org.hk appeared in 2015 with a
unique pattern of malicious payload injection through which iframes
and script tags were inserted into the homepage right between the
textual content and after certain keyword(s).Searching for this unique
pattern, indicative of an automated injection tool and likely the
same actor, enabled us to connect the compromises on hkba.org,
youpai.org, and alliance.org.hk to adpl.org.hk. Additionally, Virus-
Total [62] ﬂagged VBScripts served from 6 different intermedi-
aries, shown in Table 7. The code exploits a vulnerability in Mi-
crosoft Internet Explorer, CVE-2014-6332 [18], which was pub-
lished on 11th Nov, 2014, just 4 days before the ﬁrst compromise

detected by our study. The exploit takes advantage of the vulner-
ability to enter the “god mode” in Windows systems and tries to
download and execute an executable ﬁle (drive-by download).
Particularly interesting is the website of the Democratic Party
of Hong Kong dphk.org and its members center archive.dphk.org.
This site have exhibited 10 different compromises. Some of them,
although having links and redirections to different malicious URLs,
contain injected malicious code that apparently has been replaced
repeatedly. This observation leads us to believe that the attackers
are simply updating their infections and rotating their redirections
to different destinations. Also, two of these compromised sites
served malicious payloads from two intermediaries, java-se.com
and hotel365.co.kr, linking to two other watering holes, procommons.
org.hk and hkgolden.com. Further, we found that one of the com-
promises on archive.dphk.org lasted from 2012 until 2015, which
is quite a long time for an attack.
All in all, these groups of compromises involved 7 watering hole
websites. Some of them have been repeatedly exploited, indicating
their importance to the actors behind such attacks. Additionally,
some compromises have been persistent and survived many years.
Lastly, the actors are clearly making use of near 0day vulnerabil-
ities to ensure that their victims do not have much of a chance to
detect and defend against the attacks.
Boxun.com & Peacehall.com. Another group of politically moti-
vated websites are boxun.com and peacehall.com, currently blocked
by the Chinese ﬁrewall. These two sites cover political news and
human right abuses and allow submission of articles anonymously.
Their readers are government and none-government organizations
seeking information about China. They are quite popular: boxun.
com is ranked at 7K in China according to Alexa [21]. In our trafﬁc,
we found that this site had been compromised early 2012 and is still
partially compromised. Most importantly, we found many compro-
mises on the site with different attack payloads. Table 8 shows two
of the compromises, which are associated with the intermediaries
kosdic.or.kr and bcbridges.org. Both are legitimate websites about
government infrastructure projects that have been compromised to
serve the watering hole campaign.
The infections found on boxun.com with regard to the two sites
are quite different as far as we can see. The one through kosdic.or.
kr uses a vulnerability that was published in July, 2008 [2] and ac-
cording to archive.org, the ﬁrst snapshot of the URL on kosdic.or.kr
showed up in 20083, one month after the vulnerability was an-
nounced. The compromise using bcbridges.org is quite different,
even though the attack happened around the same time as the other
one. Speciﬁcally, it serves a script that attempts to ﬁngerprint the
visitor by ﬁnding her user agent, exact version of Shockwave and
also checking the existence of AV systems. The earliest version of
this script was found from the archives in June, 20104. Also, the
same set of infections were discovered on peacehall.com, appar-
ently from the same perpetrator. Interestingly, the archived snap-
shots of boxun.com around the compromise period of 2012 show
some web pages that are clean and don’t contain any malicious pay-
loads, for example (blog.boxun.com/hero/200807/aige/2_1.shtml),
indicating some clean-up effort might have been made but appar-
ently was not well executed.
These attack cases present evidence that indeed political web-
sites are major targets of strategic compromises. Actually, they
tend to be repeatedly exploited by the politically motivated attack-
ers. A possible explanation here is that most of these sites are run
and administered by volunteers and/or small teams, and therefore
less protected compared with the targets operated by the IT pro-
fessionals (e.g. forbes.com), which are rarely compromised twice.
Also, our ﬁndings indicate a possible weak cleanup effort from the
owners of the sites: oftentimes, we found that some web pages were
clean while others were not.
The ScanBox Framework. ScanBox is a framework that has been
pervasively used in watering hole attacks. It was ﬁrst reported by
AlienVault on 28th Aug,2014 [22]. Later on, PWC [30] revealed
four attacks using the same framework followed by 20 more attacks
[31]. These campaigns were carried out against sites in diverse
sectors including energy companies, think tanks, etc. The frame-
work mainly performs deep reconnaissance on its victims and in
some cases keylogging, and then sends the collected information
back to a C&C center. More speciﬁcally, at the reconnaissance
stage,ScanBox shows extensive ﬁngerprinting activities. In addi-
tion to ﬁngerprinting the operating system and language used by
the visitor, it attempts to detect the existence of security systems
installed on the victim’s machine,Flash version, web development
tools, networking tools and more. After the reconnaissance stage,
ScanBox has been reported to deliver malware to selected targets.
In our dataset, we detected 6 watering hole attacks using Scan-
box, 2 of which (peoplepower.hk and cgdev.org) have been reported
before while the remaining 4 are considered new discoveries. Us-
ing the scripts collected from all 6 watering holes and other online

Table 9: HTTP requests generated from the ScanBox watering holes. Domains tagged with + indicate new discovered watering holes (i.e. not reported before) and bold text
indicates encrypted values. SiteB is a submission of one of ScanBox’s reconnaissance scripts on VirusTotal [63] which does not have the corresponding watering hole.
scripts obtained from Pastebin and VirusTotal [17, 16, 19, 63], we
performed an in-depth analysis on both the generated HTTP re-
quests in our dataset and the scripts downloaded when crawling the
snapshots and live sites using three user agents: IE, Firefox and
Chrome.
We found that ScanBox serves different scripts depending on the
user agent, with each script tailored to different agents. Speciﬁ-
cally, in the case of IE, the ﬁngerprinting (for identifying OS, lan-
guage, protection mechanisms, etc.) is extensive, in an attempt to
ﬁnd out many installed applications such as the latest Windows OS
updates. Additionally, IE speciﬁc reconnaissance scripts are found
to look for a long list of both well known AV tools, such as Kasper-
sky, Norton, Bitdefender, etc. and the AV scanners popular in cer-
tain countries, e.g. QuikHeal, AhnLab, and Jiangmin, which are
Indian, South Korean, and Chinese respectively. Such enumeration
of tools could help the APT actors proﬁle likely targets and victims,
and further tailor speciﬁc malware to the victims’ systems. The re-
connaissance code served through Firefox checks for an additional
tool Xunlei, a Chinese download manager. Also, keylogging is
selectively carried out: some scripts simply have the functionality
implemented but do not execute it (e.g. cgdev.org) while others log
users’ key strokes (e.g. peoplepower.hk). Additionally, we notice
that some scripts attempt to download a fake exe ﬁle, possibly try-
ing to test whether a malicious executable could be delivered in the
future.
Although those collected reconnaissance scripts differ in some
ways, they do share functionalities, more so for some user agents
than the others. In our research, we calculate the Jacquard simi-
larity coefﬁcients between different reconnaissance scripts across
3 user agents, based upon the software tools shared among them
(e.g., the AV systems and other software they ﬁngerprint) and their
functionalities. The results are shown in Figure 2. Overall, we
found that the scripts on peoplepower.hk and cgdev.org share many
tools and functionalities. They only exhibit different behavior when
Firefox is in use: the scripts on cgdev.org only check for the ﬂash
version and nothing else while those on peoplepower.hk look for 10
more tools and software systems, and as such have a low index of
0.09. Additionally, for pomail.gov.mm where the reconnaissance
script was only found on Firefox, we found that the code is exactly
