### Proposed new feature or change:
One notices that the only Linux wheels provided by numpy on PyPI are
manylinux* wheels (glibc-based).
Are there plans/problems regarding musl libc-based wheels? Note that a musl-
libc Linux distribution, Alpine,  
does provide numpy 1.22, see
https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=*numpy*&branch=edge \- but  
as far as I understand, they build numpy calling `python setup.py build`, see
https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/tree/community/py3-numpy  
for their build script (they use openblas and gfortran) and a small patch they
apply.
A naive attempt to build wheels for numpy we tried didn't work with a rather
obscure error, see
