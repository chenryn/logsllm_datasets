In #7934 the support for this new flow call type parameters has been
implemented, but it was guarded by some check, namely that the file is
actually checked by flow.  
The problem is that the check doesn't work properly for us, where the `flow`
pragma comes after a copyright comment, eg:
    /* This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
     * License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
     * file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/. */
    // @flow
    import * as React from 'react';
As a result the stripping behavior isn't triggered.
If possible, it would be much better to check other comments at the top of the
file until the first code line.
