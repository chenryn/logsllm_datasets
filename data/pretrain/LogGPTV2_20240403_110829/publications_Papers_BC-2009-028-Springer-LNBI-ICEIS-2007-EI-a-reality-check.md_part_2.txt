(3S) model [13], which seeks to demonstrate the essential benefits of semantics to the
broader vision of Services Science, with service descriptions that capture technical,
human, organizational and business-value aspects. We asserted that ontology-based
semantic modeling and descriptions can be used to energize services across the broad
service spectrum. In this article, we demonstrate how the 3S approach could be used
along three points in this spectrum: (1) semantic descriptions of standard Web
services with the help of SAWSDL, semantic policies, and agreements; (2) semantic
descriptions of lightweight Web services using Web 2.0 technologies (e.g., REST,
AJAX); and (3) ontology-based profiling of people and organizational aspects of the
assets associated with the knowledge services.
The use of semantics for data interoperability and integration was discussed in the
1980s. We now see the emergence of an era in which the use of semantics will be
much more pervasive, spanning interoperability related to middleware, data, services,
and process within and across enterprises. This is coupled with advanced technical
capabilities associated with Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services, as well as a
better understanding of how to apply both weaker forms of semantics (also called
“little semantics”), incorporating folkonomies and limited agreements in social
communities, and deep semantics encapsulated as domain ontologies involving
domain knowledge and agreement across scientific and business communities that are
captured in formal languages.

It Is an Illusion to Believe We Will Ever Solve All Interoperability
Problems!
The main challenges when creating integration and interoperability between enterprise
systems is to overcome heterogeneity. On all levels between enterprises, we see various
and incompatible elements, including the IT infrastructure, applications, business proc-
esses, or information and knowledge models. Integration and interoperability require an
understanding of objectives to reach and technical basis.
Despite all progress made during the last decades, integration and interoperability
will continue to be challenges. It is an illusion to believe that we will ever solve all
interoperability problems. Some reasons for this are:
• The providers of enterprise systems and IT infrastructure components are market
actors like all other “for profit” companies. These companies will continue
developing innovative products. If they are commercially successful, others will
offer similar solutions for the same problem, and – if commercially successful -
create the next interoperability challenge. Interoperability and integration are
only a strategic issue for enterprise system developers, if their market position
and competitiveness is improved. As long as the own products have unique
selling points and functionality, why open them too early for interoperation?
10 J. Cardoso et al.
• Standards only partially solve the problem. Many official standards are based on
de-facto industrial standards implemented much earlier than the official
standardization takes place. Furthermore, the knowledge about existing standards
and their implementation is often insufficient. Standards are like other products:
only if they meet their “market window” they will be successful.
• Legacy systems increase complexity. Old enterprise systems in many cases are
highly optimized and highly productive. To replace these “legacy systems” with
up-to-date solutions often can not be motivated, neither from an economic nor
from a technical perspective. But inter-enterprise integration and interoperability
has to include these legacy systems leading to increased complexity. And we are
creating new legacy every day. Today’s highly sophisticated SOA systems will in
15 years from know be considered legacy.
Understand the Driving Forces Before Integrating Systems!
When discussing about the battle of interoperability, how successful this has been in
the past and whether existing technologies are adequate for solving contemporary
challenges, we have to agree on the perspective of the discussion. Driving forces
typically found in industries and public authorities are:
• Automation of routine processes
• New laws and regulations requiring and integration of earlier separated applications
• Improvement of customer service
• Improvement of decision support on operative and management level
• Reduction of lead times and duration of business processes or production processes
For all these areas, there are lots of examples for successful integration of systems and
applications or for creating interoperability. Understanding the driving force for
integration and interoperability will help to reduce complexity and increase the
probability for success.
Think in Long-Living Infrastructures!
What should we do differently when working on interoperability and integration in
networked enterprises? Any successful contribution to inter-enterprise system and
application integration will be long-living (otherwise it cannot be considered
successful) and has to be designed for this purpose. Industry areas like banking,
insurance, energy or automotive show that enterprise systems with an age of 20 years
or more can still fulfill their purpose. A key feature of long-living systems is the
design for maintainability, which often includes separation from business logic and
implementation platform. Let us not design interoperability and integration solutions
just for a single technology. Furthermore, inter-enterprise integration should be
designed as infrastructures, not as solitary solutions for specific enterprises.
Infrastructures have to be scalable, offer a high availability and provide means for
managing service levels, including performance management, security management
and configuration management.
Inter-enterprise System and Application Integration: A Reality Check 11
This Was Just the Beginning!
Networking of systems and applications for inter-enterprise integration is just the
beginning. Several industrial areas work on integration of knowledge structures, both
process knowledge and product knowledge. To develop a new product or service
usually requires various competences including traditional service and engineering
fields (electrical, mechanical, computer, material, etc.) and contributions from
financial and service sectors. Even multi-national enterprises often do not have all
these competences in-house. The resulting need for cooperation leads in times of a
global economy to collaboration and competition at the same time: In one project, a
development partner might be a contributor to developing a new product or service, in
another context this same partner might be allied with a competitor.
The integration of all stakeholders into a flexible and dynamic organization cover-
ing the complete lifecycle of products or services and of the associated business
services will create new challenges for inter-enterprise integration.

Devise Conceptual “Nodes” Instead of “Leaves” Solutions!
Given a problem, such as the inter-enterprise integration of systems and applications,
the generation of a solution can be categorized, contextualized and explained using a
tree structure. Let us assume that a tree structure can represent the solution space for a
particular problem. The root node and the nodes represent conceptual solutions. On
the other hand, leaves symbolize the actual implementation of a system to solve a
given problem. Nodes describe generic solutions that can be applied to solve recurring
problems, within a defined context. A generic solution means that a node does not
define a specific solution. Rather, it identifies the set of problems that can be solved
with a specific conceptual approach. Its influence is derived from the fact that it is an
abstraction that can be re-used transversely in a large number of situations. Nodes are
useful to solve recurring problems when the problem is not unique, and are most
useful when the problem occurs often. The defined context means that it is necessary
to put bounds on a generic solution represented by nodes since there are no
universally true solutions. It is necessary to understand the circumstances in which
this generic solution is suitable. It is also important to elaborate on it to create specific
designs that will be represented by leaves. We believe that sound and generic
solutions have not been found yet to devise intra- and inter-EAI systems since
vendors and academia has been focused on “leaves” instead of focusing on “nodes.”
Current EAI, WFM, and ERP Systems Are “Leaves”!
Having illustrated the relationships between generic and specific solutions we can
analyze the development and adoption of inter-enterprise system and application inte-
gration. EAI (Enterprise Application Integration), Workflow Management (WFM),
12 J. Cardoso et al.
Fig. 1. Top 10 EAI vendors [1]
and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) solutions have typically been developed as
“leaves” implementations without first investing on the development of conceptual
models for “nodes”. This means that the systems, languages and tools that were
developed lacked conceptual and theoretical foundations. Typically, no generic
solutions to solve recurring problems within a defined context were developed. As a
result, we are daily faced with an endless number of incompatible integration manage-
ment systems (e.g. IBM MQSeries Family, BEA eLink, SUN Forte Fusion, TIBCO,
Vitria BusinessWare, etc), a vast variety of languages to describe processes models
(e.g. BPEL, BPML, WSFL, XLANG, XPDL, BPMN, etc), and a broad diversity of
isolated non-interoperable tools specific to integration systems (tools for design,
administration, simulation, analysis, planning, scheduling, etc).
Figure 1 shows the plethora of EAI systems available in the market. Each solution
uses internal models and architectures, and very often the languages to define
processes are proprietary. This situation gives rise to the worldwide promotion of
islands of intra-enterprise integration solutions without supporting the inter-enterprise
interoperability of systems. EAI suffered and suffers from a lack of standardized
practices during early implementation that lead to reduced outcomes and strong
disappointments.
Is There Any Bright Future for EAI Solutions?
While the set of EAI solutions available in the market suffers from a lack of strong
foundations and conceptual models, the EAI software license market is expected to
reach $4.9 billion by 2012 [1]. This represents a growth of more than 300% in 7
years, since in 2005 the market was evaluated in $1.4 billion. The driving force for
this growth has been linked with the adoption of the Internet as a channel to conduct
business (i.e. e-commerce and B2B). Therefore, while there are some concerns with
respect to the soundness of the theoretical foundations of EAI, WFMS, and ERP
systems, from an academic perspective, it is clear that these systems will continue to
find a strong acceptance in the industry.
Inter-enterprise System and Application Integration: A Reality Check 13
EAI Solutions Will Eventually Adopt and Use Semantics
Semantic inter-enterprise interoperability is the key for the implementation of the idea
of a knowledge based economy where networks of enterprises (and SME – small to
medium sized enterprises – in particular) can gain advantages from the peculiarities of
the productive fabric (many small companies, highly specialized, closely connected
with each other, highly flexible thanks to the diffusion of knowledge and very skilled
people in the whole fabric). World-class competitiveness of enterprises strongly
depends, in the future, on their ability to rapidly build dynamic networked enterprises.
Novel technologies for interoperability within and between enterprises need to
emerge to radically solve a problem that has not been addressed by the research
community before.
As integration becomes multifaceted, more complex, and crosses organizations’
boundaries, there will be an increasing need to make sense of hundreds of data stores,
tables and attributes. Nowadays, the data managed by organizations is stored in
various types of schemas and using different terminologies for data assets. As a result,
the creation of a common terminology for information is fundamental for establishing
a strategic integration infrastructure. Let us consider the following example. Intel
Corporation has 12 factories, assembly and test facilities worldwide. To take
advantage of the latest technological developments, Intel processed electronically
more than 60% of materials transactions and 85 % of customer orders. The critical
goal for Intel is to timely and accurately manage the production flow throughout the
manufacturing network. In practice this is a hard task to achieve since the various
information systems spread among the manufacturing network have strong semantic
differences. For example, depending on the country, materials are categorized using
different taxonomies. As a result, information systems have difficulties in
communicating. These difficulties can be alleviated by using a semantic approach that
we will be analyzing in the following sections.
Today, integration is a top priority for many European and worldwide enterprises
and most organizations have already realized that the use of semantic Web
technologies is the best solution to support cross-organizational cooperation for SME
that operate in dynamically changing work environments. Semantic Web technologies
are already viewed as a key technology to resolve the problems of interoperability and
integration within the heterogeneous world of ubiquitously interconnected systems
with respect to the nature of components, standards, data formats, protocols, etc.
Moreover, we also believe that semantic Web technologies can facilitate not only the
discovery of heterogeneous components and data integration, but also the communica-
tion, coordination and collaboration behavioral of employees and individuals.
Enterprise Application and Human Integration
The semantic Web relies on the theoretical research done in the context of ontologies
as a formal support for treating the semantic-sharing and interoperability problems.
Ontology-based human integration aims at reducing and eliminating terminological
and conceptual confusion by defining a shared understanding, that is, a unifying
framework enabling communication and cooperation amongst people in reaching
14 J. Cardoso et al.
better inter-enterprise organization. Presently, one of the most important roles
ontology plays in communication is that it provides unambiguous definitions for
terms used in a software system, but semantic needs to be applied rapidly to human
integration to enable communication, coordination, and cooperation. The use of
ontologies for improving communication has already had been shown to work in
practice. Interesting examples of successful ontologies include the Disease Ontology1
(a hierarchical and controlled vocabulary for human disease representation), the FAO2
(Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) – which is committed to
help information dissemination by providing consistent access to information for the
community of people and organizations – and the Open EDI ontology3 which defines
the ontology for data management and interchange between enterprises.
