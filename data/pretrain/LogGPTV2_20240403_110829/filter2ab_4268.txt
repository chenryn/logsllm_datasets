title:botconf2017 PWS, Common, Ugly but Effective
PassWord Stealer (PWS) are around since more than a decade now. They are legions. Some like Pony, aka FareIT are well known. But nobody takes really time to explain what is around, what it is capable of and how this little industry works. However, they are still a common threat actively used according to our incidents logs. A PWS is not a RAT we made this distinction. The aim of a PWS is to be launched, steal a lot of credentials and optionally keylog and/or drop another payload. Sadly nobody cares about them anymore when they fire an antivirus inside a company. To illustrate this, my presentation will go thought a couple of PWS that I meet, and I will an overview of the history and capabilities of the threat, give tricks and tools/script needed to identify and decipher them. A couple of these decoding/identification tools are freely available to the community and not written by me, this task may be achieved by a lot of security people without even any skills in reverse engineering. Finally I will try to summarize these threats by giving to the participants a clear view of what is available in the field.
