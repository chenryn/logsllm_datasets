Non-sharding Horizontal Scaling
Non-sharding horizontal scaling options include:
◮ Read scaling using Pgpool and streaming replication
◮ CPU/memory scaling with asynchronous multi-master
The entire data set is stored on each server.

Why Use Sharding?
◮ Only sharding can reduce I/O, by splitting data across servers
◮ Sharding benefits are only possible with a shardable
workload
◮ The shard key should be one that evenly spreads the data
◮ Changing the sharding layout can cause downtime
◮ Additional hosts reduce reliability; additional standby
servers might be required
