query, the client reconstructs Fi from all servers’ answers, and
any t servers cannot learn i. The communication complexity
of PIR is the total number of communicated bits for retrieving
one bit from the database. The low-degree polynomial interpo-
lation based t-private k-server PIR [37], [94] have nontrivial
communication complexity of O(n1/⌊(2k−1)/t⌋). Despite of
efficient communication, PIR has not been widely deployed
due to high computational complexity [14]. One can offload
the PIR servers’ computations to cloud [66], which however
may be untrusted and respond incorrectly. It is an interesting
problem [13] to deal with dishonest PIR servers.
The t-private t-Byzantine robust k-server PIR schemes
((t, t, k)-BRPIR) of [15], [73] allow the client to reconstruct
correctly, even if t servers provide wrong answers. By using
error-correcting techniques, they provide information-theoretic
security and enable the identification of cheating servers. In

particular, the techniques of [15], [73] may result in (t, t, k)-
BRPIR with communication complexity O(n1/(⌊(2k−1)/t⌋−4)),
which is the best to date for general t. There are also schemes
[44], [55] that are mostly suitable for retrieving O(n1/2) bits
per query and have communication complexity O(n1/2).
Identification of cheating servers may be overly strong in
many scenarios such as private media browsing [62], where
a database of movies is stored on several non-communicating
servers and the client hides its media diet by using PIR to
retrieve a movie. In this scenario, it may suffice for the client
to detect the existence of cheating and then refuse to pay. If
we consider this relaxed security, then it may be possible to
obtain meaningful efficiency improvements.

may be encoded as F (x1, . . . , xm) =(cid:80)n
In the literature, t-private k-server PIR schemes [94] with
best communication complexity for general t are based on low-
degree multivariate polynomial evaluations. Given a prime q,
the database F may be regarded as a vector over Fq. Let
E : [n] → {0, 1}m that maps [n] to 0-1 vectors of weight d, F
s:E(j)s=1 xs,
a polynomial in P(q, m, d) such that F (E(i)) = Fi for all
i ∈ [n]. Then the work of retrieving Fi can be reduced to the
work of computing F (x) at x = E(i). The MSVC schemes
in Section III and IV directly translate to t-private k-server
PIR schemes that can detect the cheating of t servers. In
particular, Π3 gives a scheme with communication complexity
O(n1/⌊(k−1)/t⌋). By using the partial derivative-based tech-
nique of [94], this communication complexity can be further
reduced to O(n1/⌊(2k−1)/t⌋), which is asymptotically better
than the schemes of [15], [73]. If we consider computational
verifiability, then Π4 and Π5 would yield PIR schemes that
allow public detection of cheating.

Comparison with BRPIR. As ν(k, t) > ⌊(2k− 1)/t⌋− 4, the
PIR in Theorem 7 is more efficient than the (t, t, k)-BRPIR
of [15], [73], in terms of communication. As the price, the
security is relaxed to cheating detection.
Comparison with PIR for honest servers. Comparing with
PIR for honest servers, PIR with cheating detection needs addi-
tional cost. We implement the t-private k-server PIR (wyPIR)
of [94] and the PIR from Theorem 6 (a Π4-based PIR4 and a
Π5-based PIR5), using the security parameters, cyclic groups,
libraries and platforms from Section V-D. We choose t = 1,
(d, m) ∈ {(2, 1415), (3, 183), (4, 72), (5, 44), (6, 33), (7, 28)},
and experiment with a database of n = 106 blocks of 257 bits.

the total running time of the client, and the communication
complexity in each scheme. It shows that:
• The maximum running time of servers in all all schemes
is roughly equal to each other;
• The total running times of servers in PIR4 and PIR5 are
within 2 and 1.5 times that of wyPIR, respectively;
• The client’s running time in PIR4 and PIR5 are within
15 and 6 times that of wyPIR, respectively; and
• The communication complexities of PIR4 and PIR5 are
within 2 and 1.5 times that of wyPIR, respectively.
On the number of servers. In order to use degree-d polyno-
mial evaluations to do t-private PIR with the same communi-
cation complexity O(n1/d), PIR4 and PIR5 use d(t + 1) + 1
and (d + 1)t + 1 servers, respectively. They are more than the
dt + 1 servers used by wyPIR. Furthermore, PIR4 uses less
servers than PIR5 if and only if d < t.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we define a new MSVC model and con-
struct five MSVC schemes for outsourcing low-degree poly-
nomials over a finite field, of which three are (information-
theoretically) privately verifiable and two are publicly ver-
ifiable. All schemes are publicly delegatable,
information-
theoretically private, and outsourceable, and have highly ef-
ficient server computations. Our schemes yield multi-server
PIR schemes that can detect the existence of cheating.
