User: I have an extremely basic text based game that I have been coding and want to turn into an executable for both Windows and Mac. I am an extreme beginner and am not quite sure how this works. 
Thus far, in the coding process, I've been running the game in terminal (I have a Mac), in order to test it and debug.
I've installed PyInstaller to my computer, tried to follow the directions to make it work, yet when I finally get the Game.app (again, for a Mac because I was testing the process), it does not open.
The game is all contained between two files, ChanceGame.py (the one with the actual game), and ChanceGameSetup.py (one that contains a command to setup the game.) ChanceGame.py imports ChanceGameSetup.py at the start so that it can use the functions in ChanceGameSetup.py where needed. My point in this is that I don't actually have to be able to run ChanceGameSetup.py, it only needs to be able to be imported by ChanceGame.py.
Is there a way to turn ChanceGame.py into an executable? Or is it just too simple of a file? I'm an extreme beginner, therefore I have no experience on the subject.
Thanks in advance for any help!
P.S. I just want to be able to email the game to some friends to try out, and I assume this is the only way of doing so without them having their own compiler, etc. If there is actually an easier way, I would appreciate hearing that as well. Thanks!
Assistant: py2exe is what you need for windows.
