Reduced Peak Demand: CenterPoint’s web portal provides smart meter customers information to help 
them better manage their energy usage and costs. CenterPoint Energy conducted customer education 
on steps to take to reduce peak demands, and provided prizes for successful responses. In 2011, 198 
participants reduced peak demand by an average of 5 percent during 10 events, and some participants 
reduced consumption by as much as 35 percent.

AMI System and Communications: A secure wireless mesh AMI network enables two-way meter 
communications, provides the backbone for energy management programs, and allows for integration 
with smart appliances and home area networks. OG&E also installed a WiMAX point-to-multi-point Wide 
Area Network (WAN) that connects to a point-to-point microwave network for backhaul 
communications. The project has deployed 818,415 smart meters covering OG&E’s entire service 
territory and supporting information technology infrastructure, including a MDMS.

O&M Cost Savings: Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) reports saving almost $36 million total in 
cumulative meter operations costs from April 2012 to March 2015—about $9 million per year. These 
savings reflect the transition of meter readers to higher-value services, as well as reductions in truck 
tolls and vehicle-miles traveled. OG&E reduced about 180 legacy meter operations positions due to 
operational efficiency gains from AMI.  
Reduced Truck Rolls: OG&E avoided 1,318,455 meter operations truck rolls between 2012 and 2014. By 
the end of 2012, OG&E had fulfilled more than 475,000 connect/disconnect requests remotely. 
Reduced Customer Complaints from Improved Service: Figure 10 shows the decrease in the number of 
warranted customer complaints from August 2010 to June 2013 at OG&E from improved meter 
operations. The data include both total values and 12-month rolling averages.

Reduced Peak Demand and Improved Capital Investment Planning: OG&E conducted a VPP pricing 
pilot program, as part of the SGIG CBS, involving 4,000 residences and 1,320 small businesses, including 
the control group. It consisted of a multi-tiered rate with four defined price levels: Low ($0.05 per 
kilowatt-hour), Standard ($0.092 per kilowatt-hour), High ($0.218 per kilowatt-hour), and Critical 
($0.458 per kilowatt-hour). Peak hours were 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays, and prices during peak 
periods varied from Low to Critical based on temperatures and system conditions. Participants were 
notified of price changes on a day-ahead basis, with the exception of critical price events, which had a 
minimum two-hour notice. More detailed and timely data on peak electricity usage improve load 
forecasting and capital investment planning.  
The pilot program gave OG&E the ability to reduce load by 70 megawatts (MW). This early success is 
driving OG&E to roll out the rate to about 20 percent of its customers (120,000 residential customers), 
offering a free PCT to each customer, with the aim of deferring investment in about 170 MW of power 
plant capacity. OG&E’s pilot rate offers with PCTs were more cost-effective for the utility than those 
without PCTs.

Customer Savings from Pricing Programs: In 2012, OG&E recorded an average annual savings of 
$191.78 for residential customers and $570.02 for commercial customers participating in OG&E’s pricing 
programs; 99 percent of participating customers saved money through the program.

AMI System and Communications: Central Maine Power (CMP) deployed a high-bandwidth radio 
frequency wireless mesh network that provides two-way communications utilizing a combination of 
multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), digital subscriber line (DSL), and cellular backhaul between smart 
meters and CMP’s back office systems. The high-bandwidth wireless network supports distribution 
automation devices as well as metering data. 
Meter Operations Cost Savings: CMP reports saving more than $7 million in meter operations costs in 
2013 from AMI deployment. The utility achieved cash flow savings of almost $180,000 (in 2011-2013) by 
reducing the time between reading and billing.  
Fewer Truck Rolls and Vehicle Miles: CMP avoided over 300,000 truck rolls in 2012, amounting to 
roughly 1.7 million avoided vehicle miles, due to AMI deployment. CMP fulfills about 2,000 service 
orders remotely every day, which represent more than 95 percent of all of its service orders. CMP re-
assigned one billing position due to new AMI business processes, and saw a reduction in call volumes 
that helped it achieve efficiencies in its call center.

CENTRAL MAINE POWER CASE STUDY 
CENTRAL MAINE POWER CASE STUDY 
Improved Bill Accuracy, Tamper Detection, and Fewer Customer Disputes: CMP saw a reduction in the 
number of estimated meter readings from 95,441 in 2010 to 5,833 in 2012. At CMP, the number of 
customer calls to dispute bills, including estimated bills, decreased 29 percent following AMI 
deployment, from 3,789 in 2010 to 2,696 in 2012. Using tamper detection analysis, CMP identified 600 
improperly configured meters and was able to make corrections and send accurate bills to customers.  
Faster Remote Service Connection and Disconnection: Before AMI, customers waited several days for 
the utility to address service requests. Typical of many SGIG projects, CMP reports now being able to 
fulfill reconnection service orders remotely in under 7 minutes. After-hours reconnection services can be 
done automatically, and can be scheduled by the hour. Therefore, customers can request final meter 
readings off-cycle, on a certain day or a certain hour, including weekends. If customers pay their bill 
online over the weekend, service can be reconnected before Monday. 
Improved Outage Management: CMP uses AMI data to help assess storm impacts and improve 
efficiencies in call center operations and field crew restoration efforts. The OMS is integrated with AMI 
systems and displays “on” and “off” meter status for faster outage assessment. Customer 
representatives ping customers meters to help determine outage restoration status.  
Proactive Electricity Usage Alerts Improve Customer Response: CMP had more than 3,200 customers 
enrolled to receive weekly updates by email, text message, or phone call with billing information on 
their electricity use and cost. About 70% of the participants said they took actions to reduce their usage 
after receiving bill alerts, and participants reduced their annual electricity usage by 1.8 percent. Table 6 
shows customer preferences for bill alert notification methods. For CMP’s customers, email was the 
most preferred method by far.

Network Integration Challenges Produced Useful Lessons Learned: CMP faced technical challenges in 
integrating network equipment in its challenging terrain, which is hilly and includes many heavily-
forested areas. It often involved vendors implementing network redesigns and making multiple 
modifications. Extensive regression testing was required for each system change. Because other utilities 
may not have this skill set in-house, CMP recommends third-party support in network system design. 
CMP also recommends installing network-monitoring tools before the integration of communications 
networks, and scheduling time for technical assessments and approvals before starting operations.

AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
CENTRAL MAINE POWER CASE STUDY 
CMP formed a user group with other utilities to share information about problems and solutions and 
provide guidance for specifications to vendors. CMP found it helpful to share project goals with vendors 
because it helped keep implementation tasks and milestones in alignment with the project’s overall 
aims.  
Rigorous Meter Testing and Workforce Support: Central Maine Power (CMP) found that the need for 
frequent upgrades presented challenges for minimizing disruptions to customers, which meant that 
more rigorous meter testing was required than anticipated. CMP developed a testing protocol involving 
more than 50 meters located in the field. After researching the experiences of other utilities, CMP 
performed a bottom-up assessment of the tasks and skillsets required to support AMI deployments and 
operations. This effort assisted workforce management and helped guide the transition of the metering 
department to the new AMI system.  
CMP initially focused its AMI deployment on improving operational efficiencies. Going forward, CMP 
plans to develop information systems and visualization tools for improving customer services and 
demand-side solutions with better data analytics.
