When formatting JavaScript or TypeScript, comments placed between parts of multi-line expressions are not positioned correctly.

**Expected Behavior:**
```javascript
doStuff()
    .then()
    // Comment
    .then();
```

**Actual Behavior:**
```javascript
doStuff()
    .then()
// Comment
    .then();
```
