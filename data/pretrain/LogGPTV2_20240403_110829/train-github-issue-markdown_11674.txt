Here is the sample illustrating the bug :
http://jsfiddle.net/mzQnF/  
(just left-click to begin the camera animation)
The scene is composed of an half sphere illuminated with two point lights, red
and blue.  
A symmetry with the xy plane has been applied to the half sphere.
The sphere's normals are not inverted as expected.
Moreover, if doubleSided is activated, the illumination is not coherent, and
the specular component is missing.
