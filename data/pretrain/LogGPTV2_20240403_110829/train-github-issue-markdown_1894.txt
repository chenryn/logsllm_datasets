## Wider gamuts and more bits
As I mentioned before in #864 and related to parts of what is being discussed
in #5397, the new color picker power toy is limited to representations of sRGB
with eight bits per channel, although screens and workflows are moving to
color spaces with a wider gamut and to higher bit depths or representations
with arbitrary precision. These should be supported natively.
