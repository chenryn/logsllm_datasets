census block according to Form 477 data.
We label an address as covered according to the FCC‚Äôs data if it sat-
isfies either criterion above, or if it satisfies the following criterion:
‚Ä¢ For every major ISP that provides service to the address‚Äôs
census block according to Form 477 data, the ISP‚Äôs BAT
returns not covered for the address.
We then compute a count of FCC covered addresses for each state,
a count of BAT covered addresses, and an address overstatement
ratio between the counts.
Intuitively, this method generates a conservative estimate of
coverage overstatements by not making assumptions about an
address‚Äôs coverage if there is no local ISP and BATs return a mix
of unrecognized address, unknown response, or no coverage. The
left-hand side of Table 5 presents the results from applying this
method. We provide a sensitivity analysis in Appendix I that relaxes
the method‚Äôs strict criteria.
We further estimate the population with and without broadband
access. We use the same population adjusting formula as in Sec-
tion 4.1, except we sum over the census blocks within a state, and
we use the address overstatement ratio above.17 The right-hand
side of Table 5 presents the results of this method.
Coverage Overstatements. Table 5 presents the results of our
analysis by state, urban and rural area designation, and speed tier.
17If a census block does not have a single address labeled as covered according to the
FCC‚Äôs data, we omit the block from this analysis.

Figure 6: The distribution of the competition overstatement ratio among census blocks, by state and area type (Section 4.4).
Across the states we study, 0.83% of Americans that FCC data indi-
cates have access to benchmark broadband service are not covered
according to our analysis. There is overstated coverage for every
state, speed tier, and area type. If we (naively) assume that our
results are nationally representative, our results indicate that 2.5
million Americans in excess of FCC estimates lack access to broad-
band at benchmark speed.18
Our results diverge from the recent BroadbandNow report [33]
discussed in Section 2.2, which estimated overstatements for 6.5% of
addresses in a sample and 21 million Americans nationally. We hy-
pothesize that the disparity stems from differences in methodology
and our deliberate caution in evaluating possible overstatements,
at the risk of underestimating inaccuracy in the FCC‚Äôs data.19 For
example, if we treat BAT unrecognized addresses and unknown
responses as meaning an address has no coverage, we estimate
18We calculate our estimate of U.S. broadband coverage by multiplying the FCC‚Äôs 2019
broadband coverage population estimate [5] by our population overstatement ratio.
19Address sampling and weighting methods may be important factors. The Broadband-
Now report does not specify the source of its address dataset. We observed that the
BroadbandNow website sometimes solicits address information to check broadband
coverage. If the report relied on user-provided addresses, that could introduce sam-
pling bias; users who search for broadband coverage on a third-party website might be
disproportionately likely to have encountered challenges obtaining broadband service.
Furthermore, we weight address overstatements at the census block level to generate
population estimates. BroadbandNow directly infers population overstatements from
address overstatements, which could interact with any sample bias.
benchmark broadband overstatement for 3.80% of addresses in our
dataset and 14 million Americans (see Appendix I).
Overstatements in Rural Areas. FCC coverage overstatements
are both proportionally and absolutely larger in rural areas than in
urban areas. Across all nine states, 99.68% of Americans in urban
areas that the FCC claims have benchmark broadband are covered
according to BAT data, in comparison to 96.97% of Americans in
rural areas. Even in absolute numbers, despite the fact that approx-
imately 80% of Americans live in urban areas, the overstatement in
rural areas (310,070 people) is larger than in urban areas (139,957
people) at benchmark speeds [71]. The FCC‚Äôs disproportionate
overstatement of coverage in rural areas holds for each state.
4.4 Overstatements of Competition
We now estimate the extent to which FCC coverage data overstates
broadband competition in each state (i.e., the number of providers
available at an address).20 A broadband market with multiple par-
ticipants has important consequences for consumers, who benefit
from lower prices and greater reliability as a result of competition.
We begin with census blocks in our dataset that are covered by
at least one major ISP. For each block, we count the major ISPs in
20Our competition analysis omits local ISPs, because we lack address-ISP coverage
data. Including local ISPs would be effectively adding a constant to the competition
overstatement ratio numerator and denominator for addresses with local ISP coverage.

Table 6: Results from regression analysis of coverage over-
statements (Section 4.5). We present select independent vari-
ables that have statistically significant (ùëù ‚â§ .05) correlation
with overstatements. Appendix K provides complete results.
The dependent variable is the coverage overstatement ratio,
so a negative coefficient implies greater overstatement.
Form 477 data. We filter out addresses in the block where any BAT
returned address unrecognized or response unknown, and we set
aside the block if it has no remaining addresses. We then count
the remaining addresses and the address-ISP combinations where a
BAT returned coverage. Next, we calculate an average number of
available providers for addresses in the block: the count of address-
ISP combinations with coverage divided by the count of addresses.
We finally compute a competition overstatement ratio for the block:
the average number of available providers according to BAT data,
divided by the number of major ISPs according to Form 477 data.
Fig. 6 plots the distribution of the competition overstatement
ratio for each state and by urban and rural areas. We provide an
analysis by speed tier in Appendix J. We find that in urban areas, the
FCC‚Äôs data does not appear to greatly overstate competition. In rural
areas, however, there appears to be very significant overstatement
of competition‚Äîin Virginia, for example, FCC data may double the
number of actual providers for one in four census blocks.
4.5 Relationship Between Overstatements and
Rural, Low-Income, and Minority
Communities
We conduct a regression analysis to examine the relationship be-
tween coverage overstatements and rural, low-income, and minor-
ity communities. We fit an ordinary least squares model at the
census tract level.21 The dependent variable is the coverage over-
statement ratio for the tract, following the method in Section 4.3.
The independent variables are tract population, the proportion of
the tract that is rural,22 the proportion of the population in the tract
that lives in a household with an income below the federal poverty
line, and the proportion of the tract population that is a minority.23
We include an independent variable for each major ISP with the
value set to the proportion of blocks in the tract covered by the ISP
according to Form 477 data. We also add a categorical variable for
the state where the tract is located.
21We use census tracts in this analysis, rather than census blocks, because the U.S.
Census Bureau American Community Survey is not available at the block level.
22We calculate the rural proportion of a tract as the proportion of addresses in our
dataset (filtered as in Section 4.3) that are in the tract and in a rural census block.
23We rely on U.S. Census Bureau data for this variable, and we count the population
that is categorized as either non-White for race or Hispanic or Latino for ethnicity.
405
Table 6 shows variables with a statistically significant (p ‚â§ .05)
correlation with coverage overstatements. We present the full re-
gression results in Appendix K. The results show that coverage
overstatements correlate with a greater proportion of rural ad-
dresses and a greater proportion of the population that is a minority.
The rural address proportion has the most negative coefficient of
the independent variables in our analysis. We note, though, that
ùëÖ2 = 0.145 for our regression model, indicating a high level of vari-
ability in the data that is not explained by the factors we examined.
5 CONCLUSION
In this work, we develop a methodology for using automated large-
scale queries to ISP BATs to compile a broadband coverage dataset.
We then examine the FCC‚Äôs broadband maps in comparison to our
dataset, contributing the most rigorous large-scale evaluation of
the FCC‚Äôs maps to date. Our results show that the FCC‚Äôs coverage
data significantly overstates the availability of each ISP‚Äôs service,
access to any broadband, connection speeds available to consumers,
and competition in broadband markets. We also find that the FCC‚Äôs
data disproportionately overstates coverage in rural and minority
communities.
Our research highlights several promising directions for future
work.
Speed Measurements. In Section 4.2, we examine possible over-
statements in Form 477 maximum download speed data for four
ISPs. These limited results suggest that overstatements by speed are
a fruitful direction for further research. Future work could study
overstatements at more granular speed tiers, as well as which net-
work technologies may disproportionately lead to overstatements.
National and International Measurements. Our methods en-
able broadband availability measurements in other states, either as
NAD coverage improves or by using other U.S. address databases.
Beyond the U.S., our methods allow measuring coverage in any
location with a dataset of addresses and a set of ISPs with public
BATs. Future work could examine broadband availability in other
parts of the U.S. and in other nations.24
Mobile Internet Coverage. Our work is focused on fixed broad-
band coverage. The FCC also maintains mobile broadband avail-
ability data, which can similarly be inaccurate (see Section 2). Eval-
uating the accuracy of the FCC‚Äôs mobile coverage maps is a natural
next step, though it would likely require very different methods.
Evaluating Future FCC Maps. As discussed in Section 2, the
FCC has begun to replace Form 477 with the Digital Opportu-
nity Data Collection, which requires ISPs to report coverage using
geospatial polygons or address lists [72]. Our results show that
BATs are a promising direction for evaluating both the methods
that ISPs use for future FCC coverage reports and whether ISPs are
correctly implementing those methods.
