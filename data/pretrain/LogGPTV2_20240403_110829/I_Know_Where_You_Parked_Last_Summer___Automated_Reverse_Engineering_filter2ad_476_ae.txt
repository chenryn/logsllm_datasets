require high frequency measurements (e.g., Msps) [31, 32],
while steady-state techniques utilize low frequency measure-
ments and perform edge detection to identify appliances [26,
33]. Recent work examined power consumption in the fre-
quency domain [34], extending the capabilities of traditional
transient solutions by empowering diﬀerentiation between
similar appliances. We used prior work [26] to evaluate the
privacy breach of AMR meters.
Consumer Privacy of Load Monitoring. Researchers
have investigated privacy leakage by employing NILM sys-
tems. Mikhail et al.[5] proposed a method to infer a resi-
dent’s activities from demand-response systems. They ﬁrst
employed an existing NILM algorithm to recognize the run-
ning time schedules of various appliances. Then, extraction
routines were used to determine occupancy schedules, sleep-
ing cycles, and other activities. In their earlier work[4], they
investigated the impact of sampling rate on the accuracy
of personal activity inference. They showed that even with
20-minute time resolution, attackers could still get meaning-
ful estimates of a user’s activities with 70% accuracy. Our
work complements theirs, since we proposed several prac-
tical attacks on deployed electric meters (both visual and
RF-based) for acquiring consumption data, which can serve
as data input to their study. To preserve consumer privacy
from load monitoring, a protection system called NILL was
proposed recently in [35]. They used an in-residence battery
to mask the variance in load to counter potential invasions
of privacy. We believe that our defense strategies against
wireless attacks can complement NILL.
Reverse Engineering. Researchers have used reverse en-
gineering methodology to expose security loopholes in sys-
tems when the designers tried to secure the system by ob-
scurity. Rouf et al. [36] used a similar methodology to dis-
cover security and privacy risks of tire pressure monitoring
systems. Nohl et al. [37] used reverse engineering to reveal
ciphers from a cryptographic RFID tag that is not known to
have a software or micro-code implementation. With some
prior knowledge of the cipher, researchers used a black box
approach [38, 39] for cryptanalysis of ciphers. Bortolozzo et
al. [40] used reverse engineering to extract sensitive crypto-
graphic keys from commercially available tamper resistant
cryptographic security tokens by exploiting vulnerabilities
in their RSA PKCS#11 based APIs.
Attack on Wireless Channel. Checkoway et al. [41]
presented an analysis of vulnerabilities of automotive short-
range wireless communications (Bluetooth), and long-range
wireless communications (cellular). Francillon et al.[42] demon-
strated relay attacks against keyless entry systems, and [43,
38, 44] also employed attacks on the RFID-based protocols
used by engine immobilizers to identify the presence of an
owner’s ignition key. Clark et al.[45] analyzed the security of

P25 systems against both passive and active adversaries and
showed that even when encryption is used, much of the basic
meta-data is sent in the clear and is directly available to a
passive eavesdropper. AMR systems being studied in this
paper diﬀer in several aspects from prior studied systems.
Defensive Jamming. Defensive jamming has also been
proposed to protect medical devices [46]. Although sharing
similar concepts, AMR meters involve a diﬀerent physical
layer technology (frequency hopping), which makes jamming
harder to perform. Diﬀering from prior work [46], the focus
of our paper is to provide insight from both attack and de-
fense sides.
8. CONCLUSION
AMR systems utilizing low power radio frequency (RF)
communications have been widely deployed for automati-
cally collecting utility consumption data. This work shows
that currently deployed AMR systems are vulnerable to spoof-
ing attacks and privacy breaches. Although AMR systems
use frequency hopping, we were able to reverse engineer their
communication protocol and launch spooﬁng attacks against
a representative meter reader. Surprisingly, we found that
AMR meters broadcast readings every 30s regardless of whether
any ‘drive-by’ or ‘walk-by’ meter readers are in range, and
meters have a communication range larger than expected.
Through wireless monitoring, we harvested consumption data
from 485 meters within a 300m radius region. This indicates
that the millions of meters that have already been installed
are at risk.
A few standard security remedies are available to cope
with the discussed vulnerabilities. Yet, none of them are
adopted in the deployed AMR meters that we studied. Adding
those remedies to existing meters requires the upgrading of
existing meters, which if too costly, can be replaced with an
alternative schemes that we call PPJ. It utilizes jamming to
protect against the leakage of legacy devices and requires no
modiﬁcation of the deployed meters. Our pilot experiments
oﬀer a proof-of-concept that PPJ can be used to prevent
information leakage of AMR meters.
