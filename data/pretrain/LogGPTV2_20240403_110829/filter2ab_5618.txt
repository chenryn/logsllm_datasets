**ATT&CK ID:** C0024  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SolarWinds Compromise

During the SolarWinds compromise, APT29 (also known as Cozy Bear) gained unauthorized access to critical security assets. Specifically, they obtained PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) keys, certificate files, and the private encryption key from an Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) container. These stolen keys and certificates were then used to decrypt corresponding SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) signing certificates, enabling the attackers to forge authentication tokens and gain unauthorized access to protected resources.
