Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have an old project that was originally written in Python 2.5/2.6 for Windows. Currently, I am using Python 2.6 on a Windows 7 x64 system.

I obtained the old project, which was running in non-debug mode on a server, and copied it to a local folder. When I tried to start it yesterday, I encountered the following error:

```
15:44:58,038 DEBUG [pylons.configuration] Loaded None template engine as the default template renderer
```

I searched online for solutions, but the references I found pointed to `config.init_app`, which does not exist in my project.

Today, I reinstalled Python, this time with Python 2.7, Pylons, and Mako. However, when I tried to start the project, I received only this message:

```
07:36:36,377 DEBUG [pylons.configuration] Initializing configuration, package: 'x'
```

No further information was provided, and the application did not run. 

Could you provide some guidance on how to revive this "undead" project so that I can debug it? 

(While I have had good experiences with Python and Pylons, I am now regretting not choosing PHP earlier due to the challenges with package changes.)

Thank you,
dd

Additionally, here is a suggestion from another user that might help:

> Did you run `python setup.py develop` on the application package to install the necessary dependencies?

This should make your request clearer and more professional.
