User: I have an old project, it written under Python 2.5/2.6, Windows. 
We had Python 2.6/Win7/x64 now, and I tried to start it. 
I got the old project that running nondebug mode in a server, and 
copied into local folder. 
When I tried to yesterday start it, I got this error: 
15:44:58,038 DEBUG [pylons.configuration] Loaded None template engine 
as the default template renderer 
I see the google, but they are points to config.init_app, that is does 
not exists. 
TOday I reinstalled Python, but with Py2.7, pylons and mako. 
But when I tried to stat it, I got only this message: 
07:36:36,377 DEBUG [pylons.configuration] Initializing configuration, 
package: 'x' 
And no more information about die... :-( 
So what do you meaning, how can I raise this "undead" project to debug 
some things? 
( it was good experience with Python/Pylons, but I'm sad now that I 
not choose PHP previously, because of package changes). 
Thanks:

Assistant: might be obvious but did you run "python setup.py develop" on the application package so that the dependencies could be installed?
