While debugging a memory issue, I discovered that temporary objects from previous scopes are occasionally not being garbage collected. Disabling the compiler optimizations resolved the leak in this case.

I have attempted to isolate and simplify the problem as much as possible. You can find the minimal example at the following link: [http://play.golang.org/p/HR-7R_0f-C](http://play.golang.org/p/HR-7R_0f-C).
