User: I've been using smartftp (windows only )to work out the file size of remote directories before downloading them. I've switched over to ubuntu and ive been looking around but I don't see if lftp has this feature or maybe someone can show me a way to do this via cli or maybe with a python script
Thanks
Assistant: looks like lftp supports regular linux commands. incase anyone else runs into this just do a du -h
