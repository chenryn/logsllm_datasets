I have been using SmartFTP (Windows only) to determine the file size of remote directories before downloading them. Recently, I switched to Ubuntu and have been exploring my options but haven't found whether lftp offers this feature. Could someone please guide me on how to achieve this via the command line or perhaps with a Python script?

Thank you.

It appears that lftp supports standard Linux commands. For anyone else encountering this issue, you can use the `du -h` command to get the file size of remote directories.
