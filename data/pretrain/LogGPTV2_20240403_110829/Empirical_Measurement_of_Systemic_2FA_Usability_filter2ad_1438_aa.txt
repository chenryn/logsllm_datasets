Abstract
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) hardens an organization
against user account compromise, but adds an extra step to
organizations’ mission-critical tasks. We investigate to what
extent quantitative analysis of operational logs of 2FA systems
both supports and challenges recent results from user studies
and surveys identifying usability challenges in 2FA systems.
Using tens of millions of logs and records kept at two public
universities, we quantify the at-scale impact on organizations
and their employees during a mandatory 2FA implementation.
We show the multiplicative effects of device remembrance,
fragmented login services, and authentication timeouts on
user burden. We ﬁnd that user burden does not deviate far from
other compliance and risk management time requirements
already common to large organizations. We investigate the
cause of more than one in twenty 2FA ceremonies being
aborted or failing, and the variance in user experience across
users. We hope our analysis will empower more organizations
to protect themselves with 2FA.
1 Introduction
(2FA)
is

being widely
Two-Factor Authentication
implemented in an attempt
the billions of
dollars lost yearly to cybercrime and fraud worldwide [21]. A
2019 worldwide survey of over 1,000 executives found that
eight in ten organizations are using two-factor authentication,
and 96% of executives expect their company to expand
their 2FA use [1]. As these organizations integrate a new
authentication mechanism into the everyday routine of
mission-critical systems, they need to understand and prepare
for its impact on their personnel.
Prior research has shown that the rollout and daily use
of 2FA have unique and inherent usability challenges, and
organizations need to understand them to plan effectively
when adopting 2FA. For example, Strouble et al. estimated in
2009 that the U.S. Air Force was losing about 14 work-years
per year to missing 2FA cards [33]. Prior lab studies and
user surveys [3–5, 7–14, 16, 17, 19, 25, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34] have
identiﬁed issues and pain points in both the setup and daily
use of 2FA systems. However, prior work has focused mainly
on individual devices, user interface choices, and speciﬁc user
populations rather than overall organizational impacts.
There are two important questions when organizations are
estimating 2FA system integration costs. First, what systemic
usability effects are evident across a 2FA system at scale?
Second, what factors plausibly explain variance observed in
the systemic usability of 2FA across organizations?
Three studies took qualitative approaches to answering
these questions. Colnago et al. [7], Abbott and Patil [2],
and Dutson et al. [13] examined 2FA deployments at large
universities. Because these studies focused primarily on
survey methods to measure these challenges, we investigated
to what extent quantitative evidence corroborated these
ﬁndings. Partnering with two large public universities’
security teams we quantify at scale the impacts of these
issues using anonymized records, including over 35 million
2FA login attempts, thousands of support tickets, telephony
charge records, enrollment dates, and account credential
compromise records. These universities were the University
of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) and the University
of California, Berkeley (UCB) and they both use Cisco’s
“Duo” two-factor authentication service. Our contributions
include conﬁrming some prior ﬁndings, contradicting others,
and providing new insights across organizations and their
implementation choices.
Our results support Dutson et al.’s observation that 2FA’s
optional reliance on the phone system was repeatedly cited as
an annoyance [13]. Comparing the error rates among second
factors, we ﬁnd that telephony-2FA is the most error-prone.
From support ticket text, we learned that telephony issues
were the second factor which most often drove users to seek
technical support. All three studies document errors stemming
from desyncing, misreading, and mistyping hardware token
codes. Looking at technical support tickets, our ﬁndings
corroborate Colnago et al. and Abbot and Patil, in that new
user enrollment generated the largest support burden [2, 7].

Tracking new users through the ﬁrst 90 days of 2FA use, we
largely corroborate the ﬁnding that 2FA has a quick learning
curve. Our qualitative data from support tickets match the
Colnago et al. ﬁnding that asking users to utilize their own
personal device for 2FA bothers a small number of people
due either to ideological limitations on what their employer
can demand, or annoyance about needing yet another app.
At the same time, while Colnago et al.
[7] found that
one of the most commonly reported 2FA inconveniences is
the extra time it requires, we observed that most users are
probably only spending about ten minutes per year on 2FA.
This estimate comes from an analysis of the frequency and
type of 2FA ceremonies at each university combined with
Reese et al.’s and Lang et al.’s measured time to complete 2FA
ceremonies [19, 29]. We believe that the discrepancy is due
to user perceptions of the process, rather than the actual time
lost to 2FA ceremonies. This low time cost also might help
explain Colnago et al.’s ﬁnding that the burden of 2FA was
perceived by regular users to be lighter than they feared, as
measured by a pre-adoption survey. Dutson et al. and Colnago
et al. also suggested longer device remembrance timeouts as
a method of reducing user burden [7, 13]. We simulated both
longer and shorter device remembrance windows to learn the
theoretical impact on user burden and observed diminishing
returns from increasing timeouts. We also found that the
2FA login frequency at UIUC, which allowed no device
remembrance, was very similar to that of UCB because of
other factors. We show that the practical impact of different
client devices, fragmented authentication services, and web
session timeouts can have just as large an impact as device
remembrance. For example, adding device remembrance to a
system with short session timeouts will have a larger effect
than adding remembrance to a system that already has long
web session timeouts.
While Dutson et al., Abbot and Patil, and Colnago et al.
both identify a plethora of errors occurring in 2FA [2, 7, 13],
to the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to break down
the frequency and variance of these errors, and compare them
across second factor types and user populations. Both Colnago
et al. and Dutson et al. found that 2FA users ﬁnd 2FA to be
easy to use, but annoying. We found that this annoyance could
be driven by the failure of more than 1 in 20 2FA ceremonies.
Furthermore, by observing the time between user errors and
their next successful login, we learn how much time 2FA
errors waste. Most 2FA errors take about a minute to resolve.
However, for 20% of users, a successful login is not usually
observed again until hours or days later.
We hope this information and our recommendations will
enable more organizations to make an informed choice
whether to adopt 2FA to strengthen their authentication
systems.
2 Background and Related Work
Two-factor authentication (2FA) combines any two of:
something you know (e.g., a password), something you
have (e.g., a smartphone), or something you are (e.g., your
ﬁngerprint). Current 2FA systems typically use “something
you know,” like a password or a public key, as the ﬁrst
proof of identity in an authentication ceremony. Common
second factors include SMS/phone calls, physical tokens,
biometrics, standalone one-time password (OTP) generators,
OTP applications, and push notiﬁcations. These are a
heterogenous mix of secondary identity proofs, which are
included in O’Gorman’s and Bonneau et al.’s classiﬁcations
of authentication mechanisms [5, 24].
The goal of adopting a 2FA system is to make stolen
account credentials useless for attackers who do not possess
the second factor of authentication. Stolen credentials would
otherwise grant this attacker access to critical systems.
2.1 Strengths and Weaknesses of 2FA
2FA has the potential
to drastically reduce account
compromise for an organization. Doerﬂer et al.’s study of
Google’s authentication system [12], which intelligently
adds extra authentication challenges, including 2FA, saw
a success rate over 90% against known attackers. Their
system optionally employs 2FA among other signals, such
as CAPTCHAs, browser ﬁngerprinting, and geo-fencing
to detect abnormal
It can take advantage of
the stronger guarantees of 2FA, but reduces the user
burden by considering factors that usually require no
user interaction. A machine-learning algorithm presents
authentication challenges of increasing difﬁculty when a login
attempt is classiﬁed as abnormal.
logins.
Each 2FA systems has a different attack surface. For
example, an attacker can act as a “reverse proxy,” relaying
credentials from a phishing page in real time to the legitimate
login site. The attacker can then man-in-the-middle any
second factors that rely on SMS, OTPs, phone calls, or push
notiﬁcations. In addition to being vulnerable to reverse
proxy phishing, telephony-based 2FA can lead to permanent
account compromise when paired with phone network
infrastructure attacks [20, 22, 23, 32]. However, methods like
U2F and WebAuthn’s incorporation of browser-validated
domain information mitigate reverse-proxy threats and do
not rely on the phone system. Biometric second factors have
the unique challenge of irrevocability [26].
2.2 Known Usability Issues with 2FA
Two-Factor authentication systems combine the usability
characteristics [30] of multiple authentication schemes. Some
challenges are speciﬁc to new users, others to speciﬁc
populations [8,25,31,33]. These past works’ ﬁndings identify

using qualitative data, whereas the goal of our work is to
quantify these effects of 2FA adoption across organizations.
Lang et al. expressed their support for security keys
as a 2FA method [19] and measured the time taken to
authenticate with security keys vs. time taken to authenticate
with other one-time-password (OTP) options. Reese et al.
also reported results of measurements of the time taken for
various other second factor devices [28, 29]. Reese et al.’s
measurements form the basis for our estimations of total user
time spent authenticating across our datasets. Lang et al. also
report overall counts of support tickets submitted by Google
employees over time during Google’s internal adoption of
security keys. Strouble et al. found in 2009 that the U.S. Air
Force lost a combined total of 14 person-years per year to lost
2FA cards [33]. Das et al. compared various MFA Solutions
(Duo, Microsoft, Google, Okta, and Authy) by the ratings and
sentiments of user reviews of their respective apps [9]. They
found general user discontent with the leading MFA solutions
and suggested improvements to account recovery, second
factor migrations, user training, and risk communication.
2.3 Studies of 2FA Impact on Organizations
Prior work studying the organizational impacts of 2FA has
primarily relied on survey methodologies to identify prevalent
issues, gauge user perceptions, and suggest system design
improvements. We present a complementary view of these
impacts from a log analysis perspective and directly compare
our ﬁndings. We are aware of two prior large-scale studies
of 2FA deployments at private universities performed by
Colnago et al. and Dutson et al. [7, 13]. Abbott and Patil [2]
also performed a concurrent study at a public university.
Our quantitative-ﬁrst approach gives us an overlapping, but
distinct vantage point on systematic 2FA usability. Our work
complements Colnago et al. and Dutson et al. by drawing
conclusions primarily from two separate universities using an
order of magnitude more logs, which tell a subtly different
story than self-reported data. Further, adding analysis from
two other universities and comparing with Abbott and Patil
shows which ﬁndings appear to be most generalizable.
Dutson et al. surveyed 4,275 of approximately 38,500
students, faculty, and staff at Brigham Young University
(BYU) one year after 2FA was mandated. Colnago et al.
surveyed 1,251 of approximately 20,000 students and staff
members before a mandatory 2FA adoption at Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU). After adoption had taken place,
they surveyed 796 2FA users for comparison. Colnago et
al. also reported some analysis of “over 1 million 2FA
authentication logs from over 13,000 users” as well as
aggregate data about 2FA-related support tickets. Abbott
and Patil performed three surveys at various stages of
2FA deployment (n=83, 195, 287) at Indiana University
Bloomington. They also analyzed 1,600 support call
transcripts and 90 million 2FA logs. Our study offers two new
points of comparison which sometimes support, challenge,
or expand past ﬁndings. For example, both Dutson et al. and
Colnago et al. found overall that 2FA users ﬁnd 2FA easy to
use, but annoying. Our analysis supports these conclusions,
and we present timing analysis to estimate how much user
time 2FA takes a user every year, as well as how long it takes
users to recover when they encounter an error in their 2FA
process.
Dutson et al. and Colnago et al. identiﬁed issues appearing
to cause the most errors. Both Abbott and Patil and we
use our log analysis to break down these errors by the 2nd
factor choice they affected and their relative frequencies.
We expand these ﬁndings with the addition of data from
two more institution plus aggregate information on the
campus demographics most impacted by errors. Whereas
Colnago et al. were somewhat limited in their analysis of
technical support tickets by relying on others’ classiﬁcations,
we sampled and categorized the most common issues from
the actual text. We compare our categorization with that of
Abbott and Patil’s analysis. We corroborate the idea that setup
and new 2nd factor setup causes the most tickets, and we
add analysis of which second factors caused the most support
calls.
Colnago et al. further showed that the burden of 2FA turned
out to be lighter than respondents feared in their pre-adoption
surveys. Tracking new users through the ﬁrst 90 days of 2FA
use, we largely corroborate the ﬁnding that 2FA has a quick
learning curve.
Both studies identiﬁed gaps in user understanding of the
system which they felt could be corrected with improvements
to new-user orientation or the user interface. To minimize
annoyance, Colnago et al. and Dutson et al. suggested the
idea of using 2FA only as needed to protect critical systems
and using remembrance of previously authenticated devices
to reduce user burden. Augmenting Colnago et al’s reporting
of the overall usage and effect of device remembrance on
user burden, we examine the distribution of user beneﬁt
from this option as well as simulate the effects of various
remembrance timeouts on user burden. We ﬁnd that device
remembrance is only part of the story, with multiplicative
effects also stemming from session timeouts and the lack of
universal single-sign-on systems.
3 Methodology
To measure the costs and beneﬁts of large 2FA deployments,
we partnered with the account security teams at UIUC and
UCB to examine their records and logs kept during their 2018
implementations of 2FA using Cisco’s Duo service. In this
section, we describe the data records that were kept at each
university, as well as our procedure for data cleaning before
beginning our analysis. Both universities are large and diverse
organizations servicing tens of thousands of students. Both

are using Cisco’s Duo system for 2FA. Each has thousands
of full-time and part-time employees engaged in professions
as diverse as teaching, research, management, maintenance,
accounting, ﬁre safety, emergency response, groundskeeping,
healthcare, IT, etc. However, the overall population skews
towards highly educated students and educators. We therefore
analyze differences among subpopulations in Section 5.
UCB provided 32,366,721 anonymized 2FA log events
from June 27, 2018 to June 26, 2019, which showed the results
of 2FA ceremonies initiated after a user successfully entered
their username and password into various services. UIUC
shared 1,985,601 anonymized telephony charge records, a log
of 6,467,262 2FA events from June 13, 2018 to March 31,
2019, 17,085 2FA-related support tickets, student/employee
status data for 38,536 of their 77,931 users, a small survey
of early adopters, and engineering time tracking data for the
2FA project. Both universities also shared promotional and
informational posters and emails they used to communicate
with users during their mandatory 2FA adoption which
proceeded in phases through the Summer and Fall of 2018.
To protect the privacy interests of 2FA users, UCB, and UIUC
we established a joint IRB protocol across UCB and UIUC
and we are unable to make this data publicly available.
3.1 Data Cleaning
To ensure data quality, we performed several data cleaning
procedures on the 2FA logs and support tickets. We removed
duplicate records from 2FA logs (238,338 from UIUC,
156,728 from UCB) as well as malformed logs (2,108 from
UCB). We also removed the records of a single user at UCB
identiﬁed by their security team as a runaway testing script
which was responsible for 913,180 failed login events. This
left a total of 37,523,629 usable log events with 6,228,924
from UIUC and 31,294,705 from UCB. A sample of the log
format can be seen in Appendix A.
Support tickets can be generated by alert scripts, user
emails, and user phone calls. Automated 2FA signup alerts
accounted for 9,724 of 17,085 support tickets in our dataset.
Further, 640 tickets were automatically created when email
vacation responders replied to 2FA mass announcements. This
left 6,721 user-caused tickets for our analysis, of which 6,169
were handled by the general help desk and 552 were escalated
to or raised with the security team, speciﬁcally.
