**Abstract:**
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enhances an organization's security against user account compromise but introduces additional steps in mission-critical tasks. This study quantitatively analyzes operational logs from two public universities to evaluate the usability challenges of 2FA systems. Using tens of millions of logs, we quantify the impact of mandatory 2FA implementation on organizations and their employees. We identify the multiplicative effects of device remembrance, fragmented login services, and authentication timeouts on user burden. Our findings indicate that the user burden is comparable to other compliance and risk management requirements in large organizations. We also investigate the causes of 2FA ceremony failures and the variance in user experience. Our analysis aims to empower more organizations to adopt 2FA effectively.

## 1. Introduction

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is widely implemented to combat the billions of dollars lost annually to cybercrime and fraud worldwide. A 2019 survey of over 1,000 executives found that 80% of organizations use 2FA, with 96% expecting to expand its use [1]. As organizations integrate 2FA into their mission-critical systems, they must understand and prepare for its impact on their personnel.

Previous research has highlighted the unique usability challenges of 2FA rollout and daily use. For example, Strouble et al. estimated that the U.S. Air Force loses about 14 work-years per year due to missing 2FA cards [33]. Lab studies and user surveys have identified issues and pain points in both the setup and daily use of 2FA systems [3–5, 7–14, 16, 17, 19, 25, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34]. However, these studies have primarily focused on individual devices, user interface choices, and specific user populations rather than overall organizational impacts.

When estimating 2FA integration costs, organizations need to address two key questions:
1. What systemic usability effects are evident across a 2FA system at scale?
2. What factors explain the variance in 2FA usability across organizations?

Three qualitative studies [2, 7, 13] examined 2FA deployments at large universities. To complement these findings, we partnered with the security teams at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) to analyze anonymized records, including over 35 million 2FA login attempts, thousands of support tickets, telephony charge records, enrollment dates, and account credential compromise records. Both universities use Cisco’s "Duo" two-factor authentication service.

Our contributions include confirming some prior findings, contradicting others, and providing new insights into 2FA usability across organizations. For instance, we confirm Dutson et al.’s observation that the reliance on the phone system is a common annoyance [13]. We find that telephony-2FA has the highest error rate and is the most frequent cause of technical support requests. Additionally, we corroborate Colnago et al. and Abbott and Patil’s finding that new user enrollment generates the largest support burden [2, 7].

We also find that while users initially perceive 2FA as time-consuming, the actual time spent on 2FA is relatively low, approximately ten minutes per year. This discrepancy may be due to user perceptions rather than the actual time lost. We simulate different device remembrance timeouts and observe diminishing returns from increasing timeouts. We show that the practical impact of different client devices, fragmented authentication services, and web session timeouts can be as significant as device remembrance.

Finally, we break down the frequency and variance of 2FA errors across second factor types and user populations, finding that more than one in twenty 2FA ceremonies fail or are aborted. These errors typically take about a minute to resolve, but for 20% of users, successful login is not observed until hours or days later.

We hope our findings and recommendations will enable more organizations to make informed decisions about adopting 2FA.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
2FA combines any two of the following: something you know (e.g., a password), something you have (e.g., a smartphone), or something you are (e.g., your fingerprint). Current 2FA systems typically use a password or public key as the first proof of identity. Common second factors include SMS/phone calls, physical tokens, biometrics, standalone one-time password (OTP) generators, OTP applications, and push notifications.

The goal of 2FA is to render stolen account credentials useless for attackers who do not possess the second factor. Studies have shown that 2FA can significantly reduce account compromise. For example, Doerfler et al. found that Google’s 2FA system had a success rate over 90% against known attackers [12].

### 2.2 Strengths and Weaknesses of 2FA
2FA can drastically reduce account compromise, but each 2FA system has a different attack surface. For example, reverse proxy phishing can relay credentials in real-time, and telephony-based 2FA can lead to permanent account compromise if paired with phone network infrastructure attacks [20, 22, 23, 32]. Methods like U2F and WebAuthn, which incorporate browser-validated domain information, mitigate these threats. Biometric second factors, however, face the challenge of irrevocability [26].

### 2.3 Known Usability Issues with 2FA
2FA systems combine the usability characteristics of multiple authentication schemes. Past studies have identified individual difficulties and suggested design improvements using qualitative data. Our work aims to quantify these effects across organizations. Lang et al. [19] and Reese et al. [28, 29] measured the time taken to authenticate with different second factors, forming the basis for our estimations of total user time spent on 2FA. Strouble et al. [33] found that the U.S. Air Force lost 14 person-years per year to lost 2FA cards. Das et al. [9] compared various MFA solutions and found general user discontent, suggesting improvements to account recovery, second factor migrations, user training, and risk communication.

### 2.4 Studies of 2FA Impact on Organizations
Previous studies on 2FA organizational impacts have primarily used survey methodologies. We present a complementary view through log analysis and direct comparison of our findings. Colnago et al. [7], Dutson et al. [13], and Abbott and Patil [2] conducted large-scale studies at private and public universities. Our quantitative approach provides a distinct vantage point, drawing conclusions from a larger dataset. We corroborate and expand on previous findings, such as the ease of 2FA use but the annoyance it causes, and the quick learning curve for new users.

## 3. Methodology

To measure the costs and benefits of large 2FA deployments, we partnered with the account security teams at UIUC and UCB to examine their records and logs from their 2018 implementations of 2FA using Cisco’s Duo service. In this section, we describe the data records and our data cleaning procedures.

### 3.1 Data Cleaning
To ensure data quality, we performed several data cleaning procedures on the 2FA logs and support tickets. We removed duplicate and malformed logs, as well as records from a runaway testing script at UCB. This left a total of 37,523,629 usable log events, with 6,228,924 from UIUC and 31,294,705 from UCB. We also cleaned the support tickets, removing automated 2FA signup alerts and vacation responder emails, leaving 6,721 user-caused tickets for analysis.

By analyzing these comprehensive datasets, we aim to provide a detailed and accurate understanding of the systemic usability of 2FA in large organizations.
