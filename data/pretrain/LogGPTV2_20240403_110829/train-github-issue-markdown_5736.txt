### Environment
- **Operating System:** CentOS 6.7
- **CUDA Version:** 7.0
- **cuDNN Version:** 4.0.7

### Issue and Resolution
I resolved issue #2266 by hardcoding the Python 2.7 path in the file `third_party/gpus/crosstool/clang/bin/crosstool_wrapper_driver_is_not_gcc`. After also addressing a similar problem with `swig`, the project compiles without errors.

#### Compilation Output
```
Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package
INFO: Elapsed time: 228.884s, Critical Path: 199.55s
```

### Problem
However, it appears that the `build_pip_package` process was only partially completed. When I run the following command:

```sh
PI:EMAIL@login-node03 tensorflow $ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package testonly
```

I receive the following error messages:

```
Tue May 17 11:09:33 EDT 2016 : === Using tmpdir: /tmp/tmp.akIEI1WBAX

cp: cannot stat `bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.runfiles/external': No such file or directory
```

### Questions
- Does anyone have any ideas on what might be causing this issue?
- Is it possible that something is failing silently during the build process?

Thank you for your help!
