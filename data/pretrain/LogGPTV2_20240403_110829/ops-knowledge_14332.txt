User: I'm writing a python script that generates html file. Every time I run this script I'd like at the end to open default system browser for this file. It's all in OS X environment.
What python code can launch Safari/Firefox/whatever is system default html viewer and open given file? subprocess.call doesn't seem to do the trick.
Assistant: Do you know about the open command in Mac OS X? I think you can solve your problem by calling it from Python.
man open for details:
The open command opens a file (or a directory or URL), just as if you had double-clicked the
file's icon. If no application name is specified, the default application as determined via
LaunchServices is used to open the specified files.
