than 10, which is the upper bound of privacy parameter in
our experiment, and we can achieve the accuracy of 97%.
Therefore, our designed approach guarantees the accuracy
and protects the privacy of local models as well as data. In
addition, Yin et al. [66] introduced a DeepInversion method
which could invert a trained neural network to a synthesized
class-conditional input images starting from the random noise.
However, they leveraged the information stored in the batch
normalization layer. In our trained model, we add Laplacian
noise during training in the batch normalization layer, and then
attackers are unable to obtain the true information stored there.
Thus, their approach is ineffective against our trained model.
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we present a design of blockchain-based
crowdsourcing FL system for
IoT devices manufacturers
to learn customers better. We use multiple state-of-the-art
technologies to construct the system, including the mobile
edge computing server, blockchain, distributed storage, and
federated learning. Besides, our system enforces differential
privacy to protect the privacy of customers’ data. To im-
prove the accuracy of FL model, we design a new normal-
ization technique which is proved to outperform the batch
normalization if features’ privacy is protected by differential
privacy. By designing a proper incentive mechanism for the
crowdsourcing task, customers are more likely to participate
in the crowdsourcing tasks. The blockchain will audit all
customers’ updates during the federated training, so that the
system can hold the model updates accountable to prevent
malicious customers or manufacturers.
In the future, we aim to conduct more experiments and
test our system with real-world home appliance datasets.
Moreover, we will strive to ﬁnd the deterministically optimal
balance between local epochs and global epochs to obtain a
better test accuracy.
