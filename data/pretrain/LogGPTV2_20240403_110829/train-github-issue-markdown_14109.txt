A binary compiled with the recent master (or possibly much older master) and
`extern mod native;` fails to run in Windows XP due to the missing symbols
including `CreateSymbolicLinkW`, which are supported since Windows Vista. I
don't have a working Windows XP environment at the moment so there might be
more missing symbols. (I've received the report via some user with Windows
XP.)
I'm not sure if it is intentional or not, but given that libuv has a check for
the support, we at least need to determine whether to fix or not.
