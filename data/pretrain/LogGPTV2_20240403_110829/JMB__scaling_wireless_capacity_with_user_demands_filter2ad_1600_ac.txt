Now that the channels are measured, the APs can use beamform-
ing to transmit data concurrently without interference.
(a) AP Coordination: The APs need to agree on which packets are
sent concurrently in one beamforming frame. To do this we lever-
age the bandwidth of the backend Gigabit Ethernet to send all client
packets to all APs. The lead AP makes all control decisions and com-
municate them to the slave APs over the Ethernet. In particular, it
determines which packets will be combined in a data transmission
and communicates it to the slave APs over the wired backend.
(b) Beamforming: Client packets are transmitted by joint beam-
forming from the JMB APs participating in the system. Note that
slave APs need to correct the phase of their signal prior to trans-
mission. One way to do this would be for each slave to estimate
the frequency offset ωlead − ωslave from the lead to itself (using the
synchronization header from the previous phase) and then compute
the net elapsed phase by calculating (ωlead − ωslave)t, where t is the
time elapsed since the channel measurement was taken. However,
this would lead to large accumulated errors over time because of
any inaccuracies in the measurement of the initial frequency offset.
For example, even a small error of 100 Hz in the measurement of
the initial frequency offset can lead to a large phase error of π radi-
ans in as short a timespan as 20 ms, and hence signiﬁcantly affect
the phase alignment required for correct beamforming. Unless ad-
dressed, this error would prevent JMB from amortizing the cost of
a single channel measurement over the coherence time of the chan-
nel, e.g., 250 ms, and would force the system to repeat the process
of measuring H every few milliseconds, which means incurring the
overhead of communicating the channels from all clients to the APs
almost every packet.
JMB avoids this issue of accumulating error over large timescales
by directly measuring the phase difference between the lead AP and
the slave AP. Said differently instead of multiplying the frequency
offset ∆ω(= ωlead − ωslave) by the elapsed time (which leads to er-
rors that accumulate over time), JMB directly measures the phase
difference ∆φ(t)(= (ωlead − ωslave)t).
In JMB the lead AP initiates data transmission using a synchro-
nization header, as in channel estimation. Each slave AP use this syn-
chronization header to measure the current channel, hlead
(t) from the
lead AP to itself. Note that the current channel will be rotated relative
to the reference channel because of the oscillator offset between the
(0)ej(ωT1−ωT2)t.
lead AP and slave AP. In particular, hlead
Each slave can therefore compute ej(ωT1−ωT2)t directly, from its two
measurements of the lead AP channel. Such an estimate does not
have errors that accumulate over time because it is purely a division
of two direct measurements. The slave then multiplies its transmitted
signal by this quantity, as described in §4.
(t) = hlead
Now that all the AP oscillators are synchronized at the beginning
of the data transmission, the slave AP also needs to keep its oscilla-
tor synchronized with the lead transmitter throughout the actual data
packet itself. It does this by multiplying its transmitted signal by
ej(ωT1−ωT2)t where t is the time since the initial phase synchroniza-
tion at the beginning of the joint transmission. Note that this offset
estimate only needs to be accurate within the packet, i.e., for a few
hundred microseconds or about 2 ms at most. JMB APs maintain a
continuously averaged estimate of their offset with the lead transmit-
ter across multiple transmissions to obtain a robust estimate that can
maintain accurate phase synchronization within a packet.

Two additional points about JMB’s synchronization are worth not-
ing.
First, for ease of exposition, we have discussed the entire system
so far in the context of correcting carrier frequency offsets. However,
any practical wireless system has to also account for the sampling
frequency offsets. Note that any offset in the sampling frequency just
adds to the phase error in each OFDM subcarrier. Since our phase
offset estimation using the synchronization header, described in §5,
estimates the overall phase, it automatically accounts for the ini-
tial phase error accumulated from sampling frequency offset. Within
each packet, the JMB slave APs correct for the effect of sampling
frequency offset during the packet by using a long-term averaged
estimate, similar to the carrier frequency offset.
Second, as mentioned earlier, in §5, JMB APs are synchronized
in time using [30]. As described in [30], due to differences in propa-
gation delays between different transmitters and different receivers,
one cannot synchronize all transmitted signals to arrive exactly at the
same time at all receivers. It is important to note that JMB works cor-
239rectly even in the presence of different propagation delays between
different transmitters and receivers. This is because the signals from
different JMB APs will arrive within a cyclic preﬁx of each other at
all receivers.3 The delay differences between the signals from dif-
ferent APs at a receiver translate to a relative phase difference be-
tween the channels from these APs to that receiver. JMB’s channel
measurement phase captures these relative phase differences in the
channel matrix, and JMB’s beamforming then applies the effect of
these phase differences while computing the inverse of the channel
matrix.
5.3 Overarching Principles
In summary, the core challenge met by JMB’s design is to accu-
rately estimate and track the phase differences between each of the
N clients and N APs. This challenge is particularly arduous for two
reasons: (1) each receiver must simultaneously track the phase of N
independent transmitters, and (2) errors in the estimates in the CFO
result in phase offsets that accumulate over time, quickly leading to
very large errors. Our general approach to tackling these challenges
is to have all transmitters and receivers synchronize their phase to
that of a single lead transmitter. Our implementation of this approach
has been guided by following three overarching principles:
• Between APs and within a packet we can use estimated fre-
quency and sampling offsets to track phase: We can mea-
sure the frequency and sampling offsets between APs accurately
enough that the accumulated phase differences within a single
packet (10s to a few 100s of microseconds) are not signiﬁcant
enough to harm performance. Speciﬁcally, since APs are a part
of the infrastructure, and CFOs do not change signiﬁcantly over
time, we can get very accurate estimates of the CFO between APs
by averaging over samples taken across many packets.
• Between APs and across packets we cannot use estimated fre-
quency and sampling offsets to track phase: The across packet
time scales (10s to 100s of milliseconds) are large enough that
even with extremely accurate estimates of the frequency and sam-
pling offsets, the accumulated phase differences from residual er-
rors will lead to signiﬁcant performance degradation. To handle
this, JMB uses a single header symbol to directly estimate the to-
tal phase offset and re-sync the phases of all nodes at the beginning
of each packet.
• Between a client and an AP, we cannot use estimated fre-
quency and sampling offsets to track phase even through a
packet: Since clients are a transient part of the network, we cannot
get accurate enough estimates of frequency and sampling offsets
to use for phase tracking even within a single packet. Thus each
client uses standard OFDM techniques to track the phase of the
lead AP symbol by symbol, Additionally when performing chan-
nel estimation, the APs interleave their packets so that the cor-
rection of the channels to a common reference time has minimal
error.
6. COMPATIBILITY WITH 802.11
In order for JMB to work with clients using off-the-shelf 802.11
cards, JMB needs to address two challenges:
1. Sync header: The sync header transmitted by the lead AP to allow
the slave APs to compute their oscillator offset, and trigger their
transmission, is not supported by 802.11.
3In fact, since the common design scenario for JMB is conﬁned lo-
cations like conference rooms and auditoriums, the propagation de-
lay differences between different APs to a receiver are in the tens of
nanoseconds, which is smaller than the 802.11 cyclic preﬁx of 400
or 800 ns, which is designed for worst case multipaths.
2. Channel measurement: Recall that JMB requires a snapshot of
the channel from all transmitters to all receivers measured at the
same time. In §4, we described how to do this with a custom chan-
nel measurement packet format with interleaved symbols that al-
lows a receiver to measure channels from all transmitters. How-
ever, such a packet format is not supported by 802.11, and hence
802.11 cards cannot simultaneously measure channels from all
APs at the same time.
JMB solves these issues in the context of 802.11n by leveraging
802.11n channel state information (CSI) feedback for beamforming.
We now describe JMB’s solutions to each of the challenges listed
above.
6.1 Sync Header
The lead AP in JMB needs to preﬁx each transmission with a sync
header that allows the slave transmitters to measure their relative os-
cillator offset from the lead, and also triggers their joint transmission.
A mixed mode 802.11n packet essentially consists of an 802.11n
packet preﬁxed with 5 legacy symbols. These legacy symbols are
only intended to trigger carrier sense in 802.11a/g nodes, and are not
used by 802.11n receivers. Thus, the lead JMB can use these legacy
symbols as a sync header. JMB slave APs use the legacy symbols
to measure their oscillator phase offset from the lead, correct their
transmission signal, and join the lead AP’s transmission after the
legacy symbols when the actual 802.11n symbols are transmitted.
6.2 Channel Measurement
802.11n does not support the interleaved packet format that allows
JMB to measure a snapshot of the channels from all the transmitters
to a receiver simultaneously. Even more fundamentally, an 802.11n
receiver with K (at most 4) antennas can measure at most K channels
at a time. In a JMB system, the total number of transmit antennas
across all APs is larger than the number of antennas on any single
receiver. Thus, a receiver with off-the-shelf 802.11n cards will be un-
able to simultaneously measure channels from all transmit antennas
to itself.
Naively, one could measure the channels from all transmit anten-
nas by transmitting a separate packet from each AP, and then cor-
recting these channel measurements using the estimated frequency
offsets to the receiver like in §5.1. Unlike the scenario in §5.1 where
the transmissions from different APs are separated from each other
by only a few symbols (using interleaving), the transmissions from
different APs here are separated by at least one packet width. As
discussed in §5.3, it is not practical to compute receiver frequency
offsets accurately enough to ensure that the accumulated phase error
across packets will be tolerable.
JMB instead performs robust channel measurement by “tricking”
the receiver into measuring channels from different AP antennas si-
multaneously. This trick allows JMB to measure the channel from
each AP antenna to the receiver in conjunction with a common refer-
ence channel to the receiver. Using such a common reference across
all measurements allows JMB to avoid measuring the receiver fre-
quency offset, and instead directly estimate the oscillator phase offset
between different channel measurements, and therefore compensate
for it, as we describe below.
For simplicity, we focus on the scenario in Fig. 4 with 2 APs (a
lead and a slave) and 1 client, where all nodes have 2 antennas each.
In the rest of this discussion, we will focus only on the channel mea-
surements to R1 since the channels to R2 are naturally measured si-
multaneously with R1 in exactly the same manner.
At time t0, L1 and L2 transmit a 2-stream packet jointly to R1.
This measurement gives us the channels L1 → R1 and L2 → R1

Figure 4: 802.11 Channel Measurement: JMB measures channels
with 802.11 clients by sending a series of two-stream transmissions.
Every transmission includes the reference antenna, L1, as well as one
other antenna (either L2 or S1 in our example). Note that for clarity,

at time t0. In addition, S1 measures the channel L1 → S1 using the
synchronization header.
At time t1, L1 and S1 trick the receiver by jointly transmitting a 2-
stream packet from 2 different APs. This measurement gives us the
channels L1 → R1 and S1 → R1 at time t1. Again, S1 measures the
channel L1 → S1 using the synchronization header.
The challenge is that we would like to obtain the channel S1 → R1
at time t0 but we have only the channel S1 → R1 measured at t1.
We therefore need to correct our measured channel by the accu-
mulated phase offset between S1 and R1 in the time interval t0 to t1.
To do this, we take advantage of the fact that we can compute the
accumulated phase offset between both L1 and R1, and between L1
and S1 in the time interval t0 to t1.
• L1 and R1: We can compute this accumulated phase offset using
the measurements of the channel L1 → R1 at time t0 and time t1.
• L1 and S1: We can compute this accumulated phase offset using
the measurements of the channel L1 → S1 at time t0 and time t1.
The difference between these two accumulated phase offsets gives
us the desired accumulated phase offset between S1 and R1 in the
time interval t0 to t1.
We can similarly measure the channel S2 → R1 in the next time
slot, say t2, and rotate it back to time t0. We can repeat this process
for all AP antennas.
7. DECOUPLING MEASUREMENTS TO
DIFFERENT RECEIVERS
The scheme described in §4 assumed that the channels from all
APs to all receivers are all measured at the same time. In §6.2, we
showed how JMB could measure channels from different APs to a
single receiver at different times and compensate for differences in
oscillator offset by using a shared reference measurement across all
APs for that receiver. But what about the channels to a different re-
ceiver? If this receiver joins the wireless network after the channels
to the ﬁrst receiver are measured, there is no opportunity for a shared
reference measurement between the two receivers. It might there-
fore seem that JMB’s requirement for all channels to be measured
at the same time would necessitate measurement of channels to all
receivers whenever a receiver joins the network, or when a single
receiver’s channels change.
In fact, we can show that such full measurement is not necessary,
and that JMB can decouple channel measurements to different re-
ceivers. The key idea is that JMB can use the channels from the lead
AP to slave APs as a shared reference in this case, instead of the
channel from the lead AP to a receiver as was the case in §6.2. We
prove in the appendix that using such a shared reference allows JMB
to measure channels to different receivers at different times, and still
correctly perform multi-user beamforming using distributed phase
synchronization.
8. DIVERSITY
MIMO systems can provide both multiplexing and diversity gains.
So far, we have described the use of JMB for multiplexing. The same
discussion applies to diversity except that in this case, we have all the
APs transmitting jointly to a single client, say client 1. Each AP then

9. JMB’S LINK LAYER
So far, we have described JMB’s physical layer, which enables
multiple APs to transmit simultaneously to multiple receivers. We
now describe how JMB’s link layer is designed to use this capability.
MAC and Carrier Sense: In JMB, all downlink packets are sent
on the Ethernet to all JMB APs. Thus, all APs in the network have
the same downlink queue. Each packet in the queue has a desig-
nated AP, which is the AP with the strongest SNR to the client to
which that packet is destined. JMB always uses the packet at the
head of the queue for transmission, and nominates the designated AP
of this packet as the lead AP for this transmission. The lead AP then
chooses additional packets for joint transmission with this packet in
order to maximize the network throughput. There are a variety of
heuristics [43, 33, 42] that can be adopted for selecting the packets
for joint transmission, and we leave the exact algorithm for making
