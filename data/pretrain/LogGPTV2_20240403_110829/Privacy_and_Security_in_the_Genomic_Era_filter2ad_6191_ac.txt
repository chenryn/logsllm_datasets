### Overview of Beliefs on Genomic Privacy

The following eight beliefs regarding genomic privacy were identified:

1. **Hopelessness of Genome Privacy**: The belief that genome privacy is unattainable because individuals inevitably leave biological traces (e.g., hair, skin, saliva) wherever they go.
2. **Genomic Data as Sensitive Health Data**: The idea that genomic data should be treated like any other sensitive health information, such as medical records or mental health notes.
3. **Irrelevance of Genome Privacy**: The notion that genome privacy is irrelevant due to the non-deterministic nature of genetics.
4. **Bioinformaticians' Role in Privacy**: The belief that bioinformaticians can provide better privacy solutions than the computer security, privacy, and cryptography communities.
5. **Legislative Guarantees for Genome Privacy**: The expectation that legislation will fully guarantee genome privacy.
6. **Privacy Enhancing Technologies as a Nuisance**: The view that privacy-enhancing technologies are unnecessary and that genetic data should be made publicly available to facilitate research, as seen in projects like the Personal Genome Project.
7. **Redundancy of Encrypting Genomic Data**: The belief that encrypting genomic data is superfluous because it is difficult to identify an individual from their genetic variants.
8. **Justification of Harm by Benefits**: The idea that the benefits of genomics-based healthcare justify the potential harm caused by breaches of genome privacy.

### Expertise of Survey Respondents

Participants were also asked to report their expertise in genomics/genetics and security/privacy. These results are presented in Figure 3.

### Survey Findings

#### Importance of Genome Privacy
The significance of genome privacy has been highlighted in several research papers and articles (e.g., [Ayday et al., 2013a]). We surveyed respondents about their willingness to share their genomes online (Figure 4). The findings indicate that 48% of respondents are not in favor of sharing their genomes, while 8% would do so and even reveal their identities. Additionally, 30% believe that anonymization or pseudonymization is sufficient to protect their identity. Recent research by Humbert et al. [Humbert et al., 2013] has shown that the privacy risk from publicly available family members' genomes is not negligible. Despite this, 39% of respondents support the right to publish one's genome (Figure 5).

#### Tension Between Privacy and Research
As discussed in Section IV, there is a tension between the desire for genome privacy and the needs of biomedical research. We asked respondents what they would trade for privacy. The results (Figure 6) show that respondents are willing to trade money and test time (duration) to protect privacy but generally do not accept trading accuracy or utility.

#### Relevance of Genomic Privacy Research
We also asked respondents to evaluate the importance of existing and ongoing research directions on genomic privacy (Figure 7). Respondents agreed that privacy is important in all domains (healthcare, research, recreational genomics, legal, and forensics) and considered it most critical when genomic data is delegated to a third party (e.g., storage in a commercial cloud or outsourcing computation to a cloud). They viewed privacy as least important when genomic data is used for research or healthcare.

#### Agreement with Beliefs
Finally, we asked whether respondents agreed with the beliefs introduced earlier. Key findings (Figure 8) include:
- 20% of respondents believe that genome privacy is a lost cause (Belief 1).
- Almost half of the respondents consider genomic data no different from electronic health data (Belief 2).
- All respondents agree that the non-deterministic nature of genetics does not diminish the importance of genome privacy (contrary to Belief 3).
- Only 7% think that genome privacy should be left to bioinformaticians (Belief 4).
- 20% believe that genome privacy can be fully guaranteed by legislation (Belief 5).
- 7% view privacy-enhancing technologies as a nuisance (Belief 6).
- 11% think that confidentiality of genomic data is superfluous because it is hard to identify a person from their variants (Belief 7).
- 28% believe that the benefits of genomics in healthcare justify the potential harm from privacy issues (Belief 8).

Overall, these findings suggest that the eight beliefs do not reflect the opinion of the biomedical community.

### Known Privacy Risks

#### Re-identification Threats
Re-identification is a significant privacy risk in the dissemination and analysis of human genomic data. In such attacks, unauthorized parties attempt to recover the identities of individuals from published genomes, even if these genomes are protected. Successful re-identification can lead to serious consequences, such as discrimination and financial loss.

**Pseudo-anonymized Data**: Removing explicit and quasi-identifying attributes (e.g., name and date of birth) is a common method for protecting health information. However, this approach is insufficient for genomic data, as phenotypes (observable characteristics) can still be inferred from genotypes. For example, genomic variants on the Y chromosome can be correlated with surnames using public genealogy databases. Other instances include identifying Personal Genome Project (PGP) participants through public demographic data and recovering the identities of family members from the 1000 Genome Project data.

**Aggregate Genomic Data**: Even aggregated genomic data can be re-identified. For instance, Homer et al. [Homer et al., 2008] demonstrated that an adversary with access to a known participant’s genome sequence could determine if the participant was in a certain group. This led to the removal of publicly available aggregate genomic data from websites and the requirement for data use agreements. Subsequent research has further refined these attacks, making them more robust and requiring fewer data points.

#### Phenotype Inference
Another critical privacy threat is the inference of sensitive phenotype information from DNA sequences. Partially available genomic data can be used to infer unpublished data due to linkage disequilibrium (LD), a correlation between regions of the genome. For example, Jim Watson’s ApoE gene variant, which he concealed, was inferred from his published genome. Such completion attacks are particularly relevant in direct-to-consumer (DTC) environments where customers can hide specific variants.

**Kin Privacy Breach**: Disclosures of relatives' genomic data can threaten the privacy of individuals who have not released their own data. Using LD-based completion attacks, the haplotypes of unsequenced individuals can be obtained. For instance, if both parents are genotyped, most variants for their offspring can be inferred. Publicly shared genomic data by blood relatives and domain-specific knowledge can also be used to reconstruct the genomic data of family members.

#### Other Threats
- **Anonymous Paternity Breach**: DNA testing has made it easier to trace anonymous sperm donors. For example, a 15-year-old boy conceived via donor sperm successfully found his biological father using a genealogy service.
- **Legal and Forensic**: DNA is collected for legal and forensic purposes, and forensic techniques are becoming more advanced. However, misuse of DNA, such as staging crime scenes, is a concern. Some high-profile individuals, like Madonna, hire DNA sterilization teams to clean up their leftover DNA.

In summary, while there are various threats to genomic privacy, the biomedical community recognizes the importance of addressing these risks to ensure the safe and ethical use of genomic data.
