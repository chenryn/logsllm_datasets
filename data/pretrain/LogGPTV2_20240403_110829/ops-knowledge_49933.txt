User: I am getting the following error while running gclient runhooks for building chromium.

running '/usr/bin/python src/tools/clang/scripts/update.py --if-needed' in '/media/usrname/!!ChiLL out!!'
Traceback (most recent call last):

  Error: Command /usr/bin/python src/tools/clang/scripts/update.py --if-needed returned non-zero exit status 1 in /media/usrname/!!ChiLL out!!

In order to get permission of the directory "/usr/bin/python src/tools/clang/scripts" I tried chown and chmod but it returned the same error.
Assistant: Actually the directory was not mounted with execution permission. So I remounted the directory with execution permission using
mount -o exec /dev/sda5 /media/usrname
 and it worked fine.
