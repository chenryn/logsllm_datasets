While attempting to run `gclient runhooks` for building Chromium, I encountered the following error:

```
running '/usr/bin/python src/tools/clang/scripts/update.py --if-needed' in '/media/usrname/!!ChiLL out!!'
Traceback (most recent call last):

OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
Error: Command /usr/bin/python src/tools/clang/scripts/update.py --if-needed returned non-zero exit status 1 in /media/usrname/!!ChiLL out!!
```

Initially, I attempted to resolve the permission issue by using `chown` and `chmod` on the directory `/usr/bin/python src/tools/clang/scripts`, but this did not solve the problem.

Upon further investigation, I discovered that the directory was not mounted with execution permissions. To resolve this, I remounted the directory with the necessary permissions using the following command:

```sh
mount -o exec /dev/sda5 /media/usrname
```

After remounting, the issue was resolved, and the build process proceeded without any errors.
