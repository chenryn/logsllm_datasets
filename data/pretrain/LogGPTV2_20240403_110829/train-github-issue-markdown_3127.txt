by **RickySeltzer** :
    The syntax for initializing arrays of byte arrays is excessively restrictive and very
    inelegant and inconvenient.  Both of these ought to compile and do the obvious thing.
    See Also issue #6386: http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail\?id\=6386
    There are TWO problems.
     I) Arrays of constants can not be declared const.
     II) The syntax requires peppering the source with REDUNDANT redeclarations of '[]byte' before each word.
        const epigram [][]byte = [][]byte {
        []byte("He"), []byte("who"), []byte("laughs"),
        []byte("last"), []byte("laughs"), []byte("best."),
        }
        var epigram2 [][]byte = [][]byte {
        "He", "who", "laughs",
        "last", "laughs", "best.",
        }
    1. What is a short input program that triggers the error?
    http://play.golang.org/p/g7A-bNLV7L
    2. What is the full compiler output?
    prog.go:13: cannot use "He" (type string) as type []byte in array element
    prog.go:13: cannot use "who" (type string) as type []byte in array element
    prog.go:13: cannot use "laughs" (type string) as type []byte in array element
    prog.go:14: cannot use "last" (type string) as type []byte in array element
    prog.go:14: cannot use "laughs" (type string) as type []byte in array element
    prog.go:14: cannot use "best." (type string) as type []byte in array element
    prog.go:15: const initializer  literal is not a constant
    3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)
