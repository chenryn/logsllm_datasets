Here's a branch with my use case:
    from starlette.testclient import TestClient
    from fastapi import FastAPI, File, Form
    app = FastAPI()
    @app.post("/file_before_form")
    def file_before_form(
        file: bytes = File(...), city: str = Form(...),
    ):
        return {"file_content": file, "city": city}
    @app.post("/file_after_form")
    def file_after_form(
        city: str = Form(...), file: bytes = File(...),
    ):
        return {"file_content": file, "city": city}
    client = TestClient(app)
    def test_file_before_form():
        response = client.post(
            "/file_before_form", data={"city": "Thimphou"}, files={"file": ""}
        )
        assert response.status_code == 200, response.text
        assert response.json() == {"file_content": "", "city": "Thimphou"}
    def test_file_after_form():
        response = client.post(
            "/file_after_form", data={"city": "Thimphou"}, files={"file": ""}
        )
        assert response.status_code == 200, response.text  # ", "city": "Thimphou"}
### Description
Upgrading FastApi from 0.42.0 to 0.61.0 on one of my project, I stumbled upon
a regression in which FastApi will respond with HTTP Error 422 when ever
posting a form-data request to an endpoint where a `File` is declared
**after** a `Form`.
Searching the Internet, I found another user suffering from this issue :
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61376754/fastapi-files-must-be-loaded-
before-form-in-function-parameters
I've created a branch with tests to showcase the issue :
https://github.com/thomasleveil/fastapi/tree/file_and_form_together
### Environment
  * OS: Linux
  * FastAPI Version 0.44.1 and later
  * Python version: 3.8.5
### Additional context
I've bisected the repo and figured out the regression was introduced in commit
`ab2b86f`
