User: How to use Python to write automated test scripts, and integrate and continuously deliver them in Jenkins?
Assistant: Python is a popular programming language suitable for writing automated test scripts. Integrate Python scripts with Jenkins to achieve continuous integration and continuous delivery of automated testing, which can improve development efficiency and code quality. The following are the basic steps: 1. To install Python and related tools, you need to install the Python operating environment and related tools, such as pip package management browser, pytest testing framework, selenium browser automation, etc. 2. Write automated test scripts Use Python to write automated test scripts. You can execute test cases and generate test reports by calling pytest or selenium libraries. At the same time, you need to write key steps into test cases in the specified format, as follows: ``` import pytest from selenium import webdriver def test_example(): driver = webdriver.Firefox() driver.get("http://www.example.com") assert "Example Domain" in driver.title driver.quit() ``` 3. Configure Jenkins Configure the test project in Jenkins, set the build trigger, source code manager and other parameters, and then add the command to execute the Python script in the build step, as shown in the following figure: ![image](https://user-images. githubusercontent.com/82781430/121798715-125d4c80-cc61-11eb-80c4-6ebf3445ed9e.png) 4. Run the test and generate a test report Run the build task in Jenkins, execute the Python script for automated testing, generate a test report and save it to the specified directory middle. 5. Integration and continuous delivery Automatically run tests and generate test reports after each code submission. Webhooks can be configured in Jenkins or Poll SCM can be used as a build trigger to achieve continuous integration and continuous delivery of automated tests. The above are the basic steps for using Python to write automated test scripts, integration and continuous delivery in Jenkins. Automated testing through continuous integration and continuous delivery can improve code quality and development efficiency, and accelerate iteration cycles, which is an essential part of modern software development.
