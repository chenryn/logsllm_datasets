that have not been successfully served to the client by the proxy,
including requests generating network errors as well as requests
censored based on policy. To further classify a denied request, we
rely on the x-exception-id ﬁeld: all denied requests which either raise
policy_denied or policy_redirect ﬂags are considered as censored.
Finally, we observe some inconsistencies in the requests that have
a sc-ﬁlter-result value set to PROXIED with no exception. When
looking at requests similar to those that are PROXIED (e.g., other
requests from the same user accessing the same URL), some are
consistently denied, while others are sometimes or always allowed.
Since PROXIED requests only represent a small portion of the
analyzed trafﬁc (< 0.5%), we treat them like the rest of the trafﬁc
and classify them according to the x-exception-id. However, where
relevant, we refer to them explicitly to distinguish them from the
OBSERVED trafﬁc.
request classiﬁcation:
served to the client (no exception raised).
In summary, throughout the rest of the paper, we use the following
• Allowed (x-exception-id = ‘-’): a request that is allowed and
• Denied (x-exception-id (cid:54)= ‘-’): a request that is not served
to the client, either because of a network error or due to
censorship. Speciﬁcally:
– Censored (x-exception-id ∈ {policy_denied, pol-
icy_redirect}): a denied request that is censored based
on censorship policy.
– Error (x-exception-id (cid:54)∈ {‘-’, policy_denied, pol-
icy_redirect}): a denied request not served to the client
due to a network error.
• Proxied (sc-ﬁlter-result = PROXIED): a request that does not
need further processing, as the response is in the cache (i.e.,
the result depends on a prior computation). The request can
287be either allowed or denied, even if x-exception-id does not
indicate an exception.
3.4 Ethical Considerations
Even though the dataset studied in this paper is publicly available,
we are obviously aware of its sensitivity. Thus, we enforced a
few mechanisms to safeguard privacy of Syrian Internet users. We
encrypted all data (and backups) at rest and did not re-distribute the
logs. We never obtained or extracted users’ personal information,
and we only analyzed aggregated trafﬁc statistics. While it is out of
the scope of this paper to further discuss the ethics of using “leaked
data” for research purposes (see [12] for a detailed discussion), we
argue that analyzing logs of ﬁltered trafﬁc, as opposed to probing-
based measurements, provides an accurate view for a large-scale
and comprehensive analysis of censorship.1
We acknowledge that our work may be beneﬁcial to entities
on either side of censorship. However, our analysis helps under-
stand the technical aspects of an actual censorship ecosystem. Our
methodology exposes its underlying technologies, policies, as well
as its strengths and weaknesses, and can thus facilitate the design of
censorship-evading tools.
4. A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW OF
CENSORSHIP IN SYRIA
Aiming to provide an overview of Internet censorship in Syria,
our ﬁrst step is to compare the statistical distributions of the different
classes of trafﬁc (as deﬁned in Section 3.3), and also look at domains,
TCP/UDP ports, website categories, and HTTPS trafﬁc. Unless
explicitly stated otherwise, the results presented in this section are
based on the full dataset denoted as Df ull (see Section 3.3).
Trafﬁc distribution. We start by observing the ratio of the different
classes of trafﬁc. For each of the datasets Dsample, Duser and
Ddenied, Table 3 reports how many requests are allowed, proxied,
denied, or censored. In Dsample, more than 93% of the requests are
allowed, and less than 1% of them are censored due to policy-based
decisions. The number of censored requests seems relatively low
compared to the number of allowed requests. Note, however, that
these numbers are skewed because of the request-based logging
mechanism, which “inﬂates” the volume of allowed trafﬁc; a single
access to a website may trigger a large number of requests (e.g.,
for the HTML content, accompanying images, scripts, tracking
websites and so on) that will be logged, whereas a denied request
(either because it has been censored or due to a network error) only
generates one log entry. Finally, note that only a small fraction
of requests are proxied (0.47% in Dsample). The breakdown of
x-exception-id values within the proxied requests resembles that of
the overall trafﬁc.
Denied trafﬁc. Proxies also log requests that have been denied due
to network errors: this happens for less than 6% of the requests
in our sample. The inability of the proxy to handle the request
(identiﬁed by the x-exception-id ﬁeld being set to internal_error)
accounts for 31.15% of the overall denied trafﬁc. Although this
could be considered censorship (no data is received by the user),
these requests do not actually trigger any policy exception and are
not the result of policy-based censorship. TCP errors, typically
occurring during the connection establishment between the proxy
and the target destination, represent more than 45% of the denied
trafﬁc. Other errors include DNS resolving issues (0.41%), invalid
HTTP request or response formatting (5.65%), and unsupported

tutional Review Board (IRB) to publish results of this work.

trafﬁc (Df ull).
protocols (1.46%). The remaining 15.33% of denied trafﬁc represent
the actual censored requests, which the proxy ﬂags as denied due to
policy enforcement.
Ports. We also look at the trafﬁc distribution by port number for both
allowed and censored trafﬁc (in Df ull). We report it in Fig. 1. Ports
80 and 443 (HTTPS) represent the majority of censored content.
Port 9001 (usually associated with Tor servers) is ranked third in
terms of blocked connections. We discuss Tor trafﬁc in more detail
in Section 7.1.
Domains. Next, we analyze the distribution of the number of re-
quests per unique domain. Fig. 2 presents our ﬁndings. The y-axis
(log-scale) represents the number of (allowed/denied/censored) re-
quests, while each point in the x-axis (also log-scale) represents the
number of domains receiving such a number of requests. Unsurpris-
ingly, the curves indicate a power law distribution. We observe that
a very small fraction of hosts (10−5 for the allowed requests) are
the target of between few thousands to few millions requests, while
the vast majority are the destination of only few requests. Allowed
trafﬁc is at some point one order of magnitude bigger, this happens
for at least two reasons: (i) allowed requests target highly popular
websites (e.g., Google and Facebook), and (ii) an allowed request is
potentially followed up by additional requests to the same domain,
whereas a denied request is not.
