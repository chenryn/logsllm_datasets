User: Our team needs to collaborate on a piece of Node.js code, which version control tool would you choose to coordinate team development?
Assistant: I would recommend using Git as a version control tool to coordinate team development. Git is one of the most popular version control systems out there, making it easy to manage code versions, collaborate on development, and submit code. It has a distributed architecture, supports team collaboration, and can synchronize code between local and remote warehouses. In addition, Git also provides functions such as branches, tags, and patches to facilitate team development and merge code.
