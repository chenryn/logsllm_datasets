I installed Cocos2d today on OS X Lion, but I encounter a series of import errors whenever I attempt to import the `cocos` module in the Python interpreter.

Here is the error stack trace:

```

Since I am unable to resolve this issue, I would like to completely remove Cocos2d from my Python installation. However, I have not been able to find a guide that explains how to do this.

### Solution

The problem arises because Cocos2d relies on Pyglet, and the stable release of Pyglet does not support Mac OS X 64-bit architecture. To resolve this, you need to use Pyglet version 1.2 or later, which is currently available only in the development repository.

To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Uninstall the existing Pyglet package:**
   ```sh
   pip uninstall pyglet
   ```

2. **Install the latest Pyglet from the Mercurial repository:**
   ```sh
   pip install hg+https://pyglet.googlecode.com/hg/
   ```

If you still want to remove Cocos2d entirely, you can do so by following these steps:

1. **Uninstall Cocos2d:**
   ```sh
   pip uninstall cocos2d
   ```

2. **Remove any remaining files:**
   - Navigate to the site-packages directory where Cocos2d is installed.
   - Delete the `cocos2d-0.5.0-py2.7.egg` directory (or similar).
   - You can find the exact location using:
     ```sh
     python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages())"
     ```

These steps should help you either fix the import errors or completely remove Cocos2d from your system.
