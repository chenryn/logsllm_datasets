User: I installed cocos2d today on OS X Lion, but whenever I try to import cocos in the Python interpreter, I get a bunch of import errors.

File "", line 1, in     File

          /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickTime.framework/QuickTime: mach-o, but  wrong architecture

Since I can't fix it, I'd like to remove cocos2d entirely. The problem is that I can't seem to find a guide anywhere that details how to remove it from the Python installation.
Any help regarding either of these problems is greatly appreciated.
Assistant: You could fix it.
The problem comes from the fact that cocos2D is built on top of Pyglet, and the stable release of pyglet does not yet support Mac OS X 64 bits architecture. You have to use the 1.2 release of pyglet or later, which by now is not released yet.
A workaround is to remove any existing Pyglet install:
pip uninstall piglet
Then install the latest Pyglet from the mercurial repository
pip install hg+https://pyglet.googlecode.com/hg/
