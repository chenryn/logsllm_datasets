Are differentiation policies applied to all the routers?
Interest-
ingly, we observe that some ISPs selectively deploy content-based
differentiation policy within their networks. Among the 4 ISPs in
Table 3, ISP2 and ISP3 only mark the TOS ﬁeld of VoIP traf-
ﬁc that traverses the PoP in Utah and Virginia respectively. The
differentiation policy of BitTorrent is much more widely deployed
than that of PPLive in ISP12. The TOS marking of BitTorrent is
found on nearly 4 times more paths than that of PPLive, which also
matches the numbers in the “Paths” column in Table 3.
In fact,
many routers that perform TOS marking of BitTorrent trafﬁc pay
no attention to PPLive trafﬁc. Given that an ISP may not apply the
same differentiation policy to all the routers, it is important to cover
a reasonable number of ISP internal paths to avoid drawing biased
conclusion.
Why the percentage of pairs with detected differentiation is
small?
As shown in Table 3 and 4, the percentage of appli-
cation and AS pairs with detected differentiation is relatively small
in some ISPs. One major reason is the differentiation polices are
not universally deployed within these ISPs. To illustrate this, we
compute the percentage of pairs with detected differentiation by
only considering the pairs that are conﬁrmed to have differentia-
tion policies based on different TOS values. The results are in the
“TOSδ” columns in Tables 3 and 4. Compared to the corresponding
percentage numbers in the “Paths” and “Pairs” columns, TOSδ is
much higher. Only VoIP in ISP2 has a TOSδ smaller than 80% in
Table 3. For previous-hop AS based differentiation, TOSδ exceeds
80% in 6 ISPs in Table 4. The reason that TOSδ is not 100% is
likely due to the fact that differentiation is performed only under
certain conditions, e.g., when there is resource competition. As a
result, we may not observe any loss rate differences between cer-
tain pairs even if they are conﬁgured with differentiation policies.
We will study its correlation with network load in §6.5.
How content-based differentiation policy is constructed?
For
the 4 ISPs veriﬁed to use TOS markings for content-based differen-
tiation, we further analyze which packet ﬁelds are used to perform
TOS marking. Such information is especially useful for customers
who want to circumvent ISP’s differentiation policy. We conduct
controlled experiments by changing packet headers and applica-
tion payloads in probe packets. Surprisingly, we found all the 4

ISPs simply use destination port to mark TOS ﬁeld despite the fact
that some applications may change their port numbers, e.g., packets
with the default BitTorrent port and fake payloads are still marked.
By enumerating different destination ports, we can clearly observe
changes in TOS markings. Table 6 lists all the destination ports
which are used by the 4 ISPs for TOS marking. For instance, be-
sides PPLive and BitTorrent, ISP12 marks the TOS ﬁeld of Nap-
ster and eDonkey (both are P2P applications).
It also marks the
TOS ﬁeld of trafﬁc destined to all the default BitTorrent ports be-
tween 6881 and 6889. Similar to VoIP, BGP trafﬁc seems to receive
preferential treatment by ISP5, likely reﬂecting operator’s desire
to maintain the stability of BGP sessions. We plan to comprehen-
sively study on whether ISPs use other factors rules other than des-
tination port to construct their differentiation policy as future work.
6.5 Load-sensitive differentiation
Given the strong evidence of trafﬁc differentiation performed by
some large ISPs using packet content and routing information, we
now investigate whether there exists other factors that may affect
trafﬁc differentiation. In particular, if ISPs intend to use differen-
tiation to conserve limited resource in their networks, we should
be able to observe a strong correlation between network load and
trafﬁc differentiation. For instance, an ISP may throttle BitTorrent
trafﬁc only when its bandwidth usage exceeds 100Mbps.
Although we cannot measure network load directly, we can ob-
serve its effects in terms of loss rate. High loss rate usually indi-
cates heavy load, given that we have discarded the samples affected
by routing changes and failures (in §4). For the two sets in each ap-
plication or AS pair, we sort the samples in each set based on loss
rate value and partition the samples into two equally-sized groups:
high-loss vs.
low-loss. We then perform K-S test both between
the two high-loss groups and between the two low-loss groups. Ta-
bles 7 and 8 summarize the number and percentage of application
and AS pairs that pass the tests. The numbers in the high-loss group
are signiﬁcantly higher than those in the low-loss group, clearly
supporting our conjecture that ISPs perform load-sensitive trafﬁc
differentiation.

6.6 Degree of differentiation
The statistical tests we devise can systematically detect whether
there exists differences between two loss rate distributions. We now
study whether the actual loss rate differences are signiﬁcant enough
to affect the perceived performance of TCP-based applications. For
each AS pair with previous-hop AS based differentiation, we ﬁrst
compute the mean loss rate of each set. We then compute the actual
loss rate difference between the two mean loss rates. Figure 9 plots
the CDF of actual loss rate differences of all the AS pairs in three
target ISPs. Among them, the AS pairs of ISP9 have the smallest
loss rate differences, mostly under 3%. In contrast, the differences
are much more evident for AS pairs in ISP3. Nearly 10% of them
have loss rate difference over 4%. Such large loss rate difference
will certainly lead to perceptible performance difference for many
TCP-based applications.
Figure 10 illustrates the CDF of actual loss rate differences of the
application pairs included in Table 3. For each application pair, the
actual loss rate difference is computed as the difference between
the mean loss rate of an application (e.g., BitTorrent) and that of
HTTP. Clearly, the degree of content-based differentiation varies
signiﬁcantly across different applications and ISPs. For instance,
ISP2 treats SMTP only slightly worse than HTTP. Their loss rate
differences are smaller than 2% on nearly 90% of paths. In compar-
ison, ISP3 gives VoIP much higher priority than HTTP, possibly
reﬂecting their desire to meet the QoS requirements of the VoIP
service provided by themselves. Interestingly, although both Bit-
Torrent and PPLive experience worse performance than HTTP in
ISP12, the loss rates of PPLive are even higher than those of Bit-
Torrent. This is because the paths with PPLive differentiation are
only a subset of those with BitTorrent differentiation (explained in
§6.4) and this subset of paths tend to have higher loss rates than
other paths.

6.7 Implementation of differentiation in
router testbed
In this section, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing
and enforcing trafﬁc differentiation in today’s commercial routers.
As shown in Figure 11, we set up our own experimental testbed us-
ing two high-end routers (Cisco 7300 and 12000) running the latest
IOS 12.3 from the Schooner testbed [3]. Host A transmits BitTor-
rent and HTTP trafﬁc to host B via R1 and R2. All the machines
and routers are connected using Gigabit Ethernet links. To con-
ﬁgure the routers for port-based differentiation, we deﬁne a port-
map on R1 to capture all the packets with the default BitTorrent
port and mark their TOS ﬁeld using policy map. Interestingly, we
found the default router conﬁgurations already include pre-deﬁned
port-maps for applications such as Napster, Kazaa, SMTP, etc. [9],
which greatly simpliﬁes the work of conﬁguring differentiation for
these applications. The actual router commands used in the Cisco
command line interface (CLI) are shown in Figure 11. Similarly,
to implement previous-hop AS based differentiation, we can easily
mark packets based on incoming interfaces by changing the deﬁni-
tion of class-map to class-map NEIGHBOR match interface Giga-
bitEthernet 1/0. We conﬁgure R2 to prioritize trafﬁc on its incom-
ing interface using weighted random early drop (WRED) queuing.
In § 6.5, we observed that the effects of trafﬁc differentiation are
more perceptible when network load is high. To illustrate this, we
measure the loss rate differences between HTTP and BitTorrent as
we control the sending rate on A. The conﬁgurations of R1 and
R2 remain the same throughout the experiments. R2 will restrict
the BitTorrent bandwidth to be within 110Mbps. Figure 12 shows
the actual loss rate differences between BitTorrent and HTTP under
two different ranges of sending rates. When the sending rate is high
(80 - 150Mbps), the loss rate differences can go up to 7%. In con-
trast, when the sending rate is below the bandwidth limit (80 - 110
Mbps), the loss rate differences become negligibly small. We also
measure the overhead induced by the differentiation conﬁgurations
on R1 and R2. From the SNMP logs, we observed little changes
in the CPU utilization on R1 and R2 when we disable or enable
112the differentiation conﬁgurations. This indicates the overhead of
enforcing both types of differentiation is small.
7. SYSTEM EVALUATION
In this section, we study the parameter settings and system per-
formance in NetPolice. We will explain the choice of redundancy
factor and maximum probing threshold (deﬁned in § 3.1). We will
also evaluate the resource usage of NetPolice in terms of network,
memory, and CPU. Our evaluation results demonstrate the feasibil-
ity of deploying NetPolice as a lightweight tool for continually de-
tecting trafﬁc differentiation in multiple large ISPs simultaneously.
Parameter settings
The path selection process of NetPolice
is controlled by two pre-deﬁned parameters: the redundancy fac-
tor R and the maximum probing threshold m (§ 3.1). R de-
termines the number of distinct paths that will traverse each ele-
ment. An element can be a three-tuple of (src, ingress, egress)
or (ingress, egress, dst). Figure 13 shows the maximum number
of destinations assigned to a prober increases with R and remains
the same once R exceeds 100. This means when R > 100, the
redundancy of each element is no longer determined by R but by
the set of destinations the probers can probe. We set R = 100 to
obtain the best coverage.
