corresponding to CESRM are again split into two com-
ponents. The white component corresponds to expedited
replies multicast in response to expedited requests as part of
CESRM’s expedited recovery process; the gray component
corresponds to replies that are multicast in response to non-
expedited requests when CESRM falls back on SRM’s re-
covery scheme. Again, the source of the IP multicast trans-
mission corresponds to receiver 0.
As Figure 4 shows, for most receivers in each of the
simulations, CESRM sends substantially fewer packet re-
transmissions (replies) than SRM. This is to be expected
since successful expedited recoveries usually involve a sin-
gle expedited reply, whereas SRM’s suppression scheme
may often result in duplicate replies per recovery. The re-
duction in the number of packet retransmission offers a sig-
niﬁcant improvement over SRM, since packet retransmis-
sions carry payload, and are therefore generally larger than
control messages.
The ﬁrst plot in Figure 5 depicts the percentage of suc-
cessful expedited recoveries achieved by CESRM for each
of the traces. An expedited recovery is successful when the
expedited request induces the transmission of an expedited
reply. The percentage of successful expedited recoveries is
given by the ratio of the number of expedited requests to the
number of expedited replies transmitted during the simula-
tion. We observe that more than 70% of the expedited re-
coveries are successful for all traces and as many as 80%
are successful in all but two of the traces.
The second plot of Figure 5 depicts the transmission
overhead of CESRM, as a percentage of the transmission
overhead of SRM for each of the traces. This number
amounts to 100% in traces where SRM and CESRM in-
cur the same transmission overhead. We divide the trans-
mission overhead into two parts; that incurred by retrans-
missions and that incurred by control packets. We also dis-
tinguish between unicast and multicast control packets. The
transmission overhead of either CESRM or SRM is calcu-
lated by assigning a cost of 1 unit for transmitting a packet
across any single link of the IP multicast tree and measur-
ing the total number of such transmissions for each trace.
Figure 5 reveals that the transmission overhead incurred
by CESRM retransmissions is substantially smaller than
that incurred by SRM retransmissions. For all the traces, the
retransmission overhead of CESRM is less than 80% of that
of SRM. In 10 of the 14 traces, it is even less than 60% of
that of SRM. In the case of control packets, CESRM’s over-
head is less than 52% of that of SRM for all but one of the
traces. This demonstrates our claim that CESRM greatly re-
duces SRM’s overall recovery overhead.

liable multicast protocol, which augments SRM with a

caching-based expedited recovery scheme. CESRM ex-
ploits packet loss locality in order to reduce the overhead
and improve the recovery time of SRM. Trace-driven sim-
ulations revealed that, indeed, CESRM reduces the aver-
age recovery time of SRM by an average of roughly 50%.
We further observed that these performance gains do not in-
troduce additional packet overhead. On the contrary, in
all of our simulations, CESRM reduced the total num-
ber of packet retransmissions sent. Moreover, the overhead
associated with sending control packets in CESRM was sig-
niﬁcantly smaller than that of SRM.
CESRM’s expedited requests and replies resemble those
occurring in router-assisted protocols [8, 12, 13], where re-
quests are intelligently forwarded to designated repliers.
Unlike these protocols, however, CESRM can be deployed
over IP multicast without any special router support. We
have also presented a router-assisted version of CESRM
that makes use of intelligent router capabilities (if present)
in order to limit the exposure of packet retransmissions.
This protocol is more “light-weight” than router-assisted
protocols like LMS [13], since it assumes fewer router ca-
pabilities. Moreover, unlike LMS, CESRM can continue to
recover packets even while the multicast group is reconﬁg-
uring and the previously chosen repliers leave the group.
This results from the fact that CESRM’s recovery mecha-
nism falls back on that of SRM.
