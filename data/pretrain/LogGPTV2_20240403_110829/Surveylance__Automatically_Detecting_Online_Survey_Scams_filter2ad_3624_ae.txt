| Brazil  | 18%             | 21%                |
| Czech   | 8%              | 7%                 |
| India   | 9%              | 9%                 |
| Luxembourg | 12%          | 15%                |

| **Total** | 1,702 (100%)  | 13,808 (100%)      |

**Note:** This table is based on 15,510 valid WHOIS records. The hosting infrastructure for survey scam services is primarily concentrated in Russia, Eastern Europe, Central and South America.

### Analysis of Survey Scam Ecosystem

#### A. Hosted Domains and Visitor Traffic
Domains such as scanlibs.com and ebook-dl.com, both ranked in the Alexa Top 100K, are frequently visited by users. On average, 32% of the visitors to these websites come from search engines, indicating a high level of connectivity with benign websites in the Alexa Top 100K.

#### B. Relationship Between Survey Gateways and Publishers
We conducted an experiment to investigate the relationship between survey gateways and publishers using their WHOIS records. Although 41 survey publishers were found to share IP addresses with 3 survey gateways, our analysis did not confirm a significant relationship. We identified 10,029 IP addresses with low historical reputation, often used for malicious purposes, such as hosting malicious domains. This supports the notion that attackers reuse the same infrastructure for multiple malicious activities due to limited resources.

Additionally, 68% of the survey publishers resolved to 11/24 network addresses, suggesting that a few individuals or groups manage large collections of survey scam websites using a limited set of infrastructures.

#### C. Geographical Distribution
Our analysis of the geographical distribution of survey scam services revealed that the majority of these services are hosted in Russia, Eastern Europe, Central, and South America. For example, the incidence of survey scams in the Czech Republic and Luxembourg is twice as high as in the United States. The most popular hosting locations for survey scam services are Panama, Brazil, and Russia, accounting for 49% of all gateways and 59% of publishers observed.

#### D. Social Engineering and Deceptive Advertisements
Adversaries behind survey scams use various techniques to monetize their activities, including injected ads, pop-ups, and redirections. Our analysis of overlay ads and widgets showed that they are commonly used in both survey gateways and publishers. These overlays often block the screen, requiring users to complete a survey to proceed. Figure 6 illustrates an example where a widget without an exit button asks the user to complete a survey. In another case, shown in Figure 7, users are asked to update a Flash player or click on a fake terms and conditions button, which redirects them to a registration page. In 21% of cases, users are exposed to transparently injected overlay ads with fake close buttons, potentially leading to the download of malicious binaries.

#### E. Interaction with Survey Publishers
Interactions with survey publishers often result in the opening of multiple webpages displaying advertisements. This is achieved by setting an EventListener on submission button clicks. Our initial crawling results showed that 63% of survey publishers inject ads as transparent iframes. To better understand this, we updated the crawler code to identify and click on the overlay iframes, log any redirections, and capture screenshots of the opened webpages.

#### F. Automated Clustering and Labeling
To minimize human intervention in determining the type of page a user is directed to, we used image processing techniques to label pages based on their visual appearance. We crawled 700 survey gateways using Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, collecting 1,802 URLs. These URLs were clustered by checking the structural similarity of the screenshots. We categorized the pages into four clusters: surveys, scams, adult content, and registration pages. In 366 cases, users were required to download a binary, and we cross-checked the reputation of these binaries with VirusTotal, categorizing them as malicious documents, malware, or PUPs.

#### G. Large-Scale Experiment
To conduct a more comprehensive analysis, we performed the same experiment on 318,219 survey publishers, reachable from 8,623 survey gateways detected by SURVEYLANCE. After removing 3,209 publishers that required CAPTCHA, we filled out 131,277 unique surveys. The main goal was to identify the types of threats after completing the surveys. Using the same clustering threshold (β = 0.82), we categorized the remaining URLs. On average, 46.2% of the time, a click on the submit button led to a PUP-hosting webpage. Chrome was the most exposed browser to PUPs through survey scam websites, likely due to its popularity. We also observed scenarios where victims were asked to enter sensitive information, such as Social Security Numbers or credit card numbers, to receive "rewards." Additionally, 118 cases involved pop-up widgets claiming the visitor's computer was infected with malware, leading to technical support scams.
