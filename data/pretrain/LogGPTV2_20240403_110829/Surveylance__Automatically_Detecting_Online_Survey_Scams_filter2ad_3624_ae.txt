ers, can be directly reached by visiting scanlibs.com or
ebook-dl.com. Both of these domains are ranked in the
Alexa Top 100K. On average, 32% of the visitors of these
websites come from a search engine which implies that these
websites are highly-connected with benign websites in the
Alexa Top 100K.
We performed an experiment to test whether there is a
relationship between survey gateways and publishers based
on their WHOIS records. Although we observed 41 survey
publishers that resolved to the IP addresses that 3 survey
gateways were using, the results of our analysis did not conﬁrm
that the relationship is signiﬁcant. We found 10,029 IP ad-
dresses hosting survey gateways and publishers which had low
historical reputation (based on a blacklist comparison), as they
were extensively used for malicious purposes (e.g., hosting
malicious domains). The results support the folk wisdom that
attackers have limited resources, and frequently use the same
underlying infrastructure for multiple purposes.
We found that 68% of the survey publishers resolved to 11
/24 network addresses. This ﬁnding suggests that there are
individuals with relatively large collections of survey scam
websites, and that they use a limited set of infrastructures and
addresses to carry out their attacks.
We performed another experiment to gain insights into the
geographical locations of survey scam services by analyzing
the distribution of countries in which these websites were
hosted. Table VII shows the geographical distribution by coun-
try of survey scam services that we detected. The results clearly
imply that the distribution of survey services is centered mainly
around Russia, Eastern Europe, Central and South America.
For instance, we found that the incidence of survey scams in
some European countries – including the Czech Republic and

Luxembourg – is twice as high than the United States. Overall,
Panama, Brazil, and Russia were the most popular hosting
locations for survey scam services, accounting for 49% of all
the gateways and 59% of publishers we observed.
C. Social Engineering, Deceptive Advertisements
As mentioned earlier, adversaries behind the survey scam
ecosystem use a variety of techniques to monetize their busi-
ness (e.g. injected ads, pop-ups, redirection). In the context of
this paper, we performed an analysis of unavoidable overlays
shown to users in these websites. We observed that overlay ads
and widgets are signiﬁcantly used both in survey gateways and
publishers. For example, we found cases where a user was
presented with overlay widgets which blocked most of the
screen, and required the user to accept completing a survey
to be able to proceed. Figure 6 illustrates an example that
the widget super-imposed on the page, without an exit button,
asking the user to complete a survey. In another case, as shown
in Figure 7, the user is asked to either update the ﬂash player,
or click on the terms and conditions button, which is a fake
button that redirects the user to another registration page. In
21% of the cases, the user is exposed to overlay ads which
were transparently injected into a page on top of each other
with a fake close button. Such deceptive practices can lure a
user into clicking on a potentially malicious ad or downloading
a potentially malicious binary. In the following section, we
explain attack scenarios where survey scammers attempt to
make permanent changes to the user’s system environment in
addition to extracting personal information.
During the course of our experiments, we noticed that the
interaction with survey publishers usually results in opening
multiple webpages that display advertisements. This is sim-
ply achieved by setting an EventListener on submission
button clicks. Our initial crawling results showed that 63% of
the survey publishers inject ads as transparent iframes. When
the user clicks on a submit button, she, in fact, clicks on the
overlay iframes. We updated the crawler code to identify the
 elements and click on the overlay. The crawler
also logged any redirections to other domains or downloaded
binaries, and captured screenshots of the opened webpages.

In fact, manually checking the landing page and identifying

to
determine the type of the page that a user is directed to
with minimal human intervention, we leverage some image
processing techniques to label
them based on the visual
appearance of the page. To this end, we crawled the 700
survey gateways in our labeled dataset using three different
browser vendors – Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer –
to increase the analysis coverage, and also to decrease the
effects of standard browser-based cloaking mechanisms. We
collected 1,802 URLs as a result of submitting survey forms.
These pages were opened in a new window or in the same
window via page redirection. To analyze these URLs and
automatically label them, we clustered the URLs by checking
the structural similarity [50] among the visual appearance of
the screenshots. We considered the structural similarity of the
page since our initial analysis showed that the destination
pages that a user is redirected to, after ﬁlling out the survey
scams, is a ﬁnite set of malicious webpages. We exploited
the high structural similarity among these webpages given the
fact that this measure produces a high similarity score for two
images with minor changes in color, scale, or ratio alteration.
We categorized the perceived functionality of the pages into
four clusters: survey, scam, adult, or another registration page.
In 366 cases, the opened URL required the user to download a
binary in order to receive the content of interest. In these cases,
checking the structural similarity of the page did not reveal
much about the type of binary to which a user may be exposed.
We cross-checked the reputation of the downloaded binaries
with VirusTotal, and deﬁned three other categories based on
the reports we received: malicious document, malware, and
PUP.
The procedure to manually label all the 1,802 URLs took
67 hours of work. However, it saved us hundreds of hours of
manual work for the more comprehensive experiment which
we describe later. After the manual clustering, we measured
the precision and recall by varying the value of the structural
similarity threshold in order to determine the best structural
similarity threshold for the 4 categories that we deﬁned.
Empirically, we assigned the threshold value β = 0.82 since
at this value we were able to generate tighter clusters of
websites representing different classes of threats. This experi-
ment allowed us to determine conﬁguration parameters for the
automatic clustering performed in the large-scale experiment

we describe later. Note that this is an independent experiment,
based on the output of SURVEYLANCE, to study the types
of threats introduced by survey publishers, and is different
from the experiments discussed in Section V with the goal of
evaluating the detection capabilities of the classiﬁcation model
in SURVEYLANCE.
To conduct a more comprehensive analysis, we performed
the same experiment on 318,219 survey publishers that were
reachable from the 8,623 survey gateways detected by SUR-
VEYLANCE (see Table IV). Since we were not able to auto-
matically complete the survey in pages that required ﬁlling
a CAPTCHA, we removed 3,209 survey publishers from our
experiments. In this experiment, out of 318,219 survey pages,
we were able to ﬁll out 131,277 unique surveys using three
different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer).
Since the main goal of the experiment was to identify the types
of threats after completing the surveys, we carefully analyzed
what a visiting user is shown after ﬁlling out the surveys. We
used the same clustering threshold (β = 0.82) to categorize
the remaining URLs. Table VIII represents the result of the
experiment after verifying the binaries with VirusTotal.
On average, 46.2% of the time, a click on the submit button
resulted in opening pages that led an unsuspecting user to
a PUP-hosting webpage. These pages attempted to trick the
visiting user by claiming that she needed to install special
software, or update the current version of her program to view
the intended content. Figure 7 shows an example of such a
webpage that was opened after SURVEYLANCE automatically
completed the survey. This page asks the user to download
a malicious binary which installs a backdoor on the user
machine. Our analysis of 131,277 successfully ﬁlled survey
suggests that some browsers have greater exposure to PUP-
hosting webpages. Speciﬁcally, Chrome is the most exposed
browser to PUPs though survey scam websites. One reason
for this could be that, as reported in recent security studies,
adversaries tend to target more popular browsers for survey
scams similar to malvertising [45], [52]. We also observed
scenarios where victims were shown other types of scam
pages. In such cases, victims were asked to enter highly
sensitive information, such as a Social Security Number or a
credit card number, along with other information to receive
“rewards” (Figure 10 in Appendix C). We also found 118
cases where pop-up widgets claimed that the visitor’s computer
was infected with malware. These websites are entry points to
technical support scams which have recently been explored in
prior work [23].
Based on our analysis, one can conclude that survey
