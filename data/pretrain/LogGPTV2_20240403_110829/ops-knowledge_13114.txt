User: I've set up PyCharm, created my virtualenv (either through the virtual env command, or directly in PyCharm) and activated that environment as my Interpreter. Everything is working just fine.
However, if I open a terminal using "Tools, Open Terminal", the shell prompt supplied is not using the virtual env; I still have to use source ~/envs/someenv/bin/activate within that Terminal to activate it.
Another method is to activate the environment in a shell, and run PyCharm from that environment. This is "workable" but pretty ugly, and means I have major problems if I switch environments or projects from PyCharm: I'm now using the totally-wrong environment.
Is there some other, much-easier way to have "Tools, Open Terminal" automatically activate the virtual environment?
Assistant: I had the similar problem of not having venv activated in pycharm terminal (Pycharm version 2021.2.2). Just simply follow the steps below.
Go to "settings -> tools -> terminal" then at the bottom of that window check if "Activate virtualenv" is having a tick or not, if not then make sure that box is ticked.
Then in the middle part of that window check the the shell path is set to "cmd.exe" or not, if not then set it to "cmd.exe" (it will have it's path associated with it so no need to do anything just click on "cmd.exe" from the drop down list) then click on "apply" button below and click "ok".
Now it's done, just close your opened terminal and re-open it. You will see "venv" in front of your project path.
