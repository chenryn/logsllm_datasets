I have successfully set up PyCharm, created a virtual environment (using either the `virtualenv` command or directly within PyCharm), and activated it as my project interpreter. Everything is functioning correctly.

However, when I open a terminal via "Tools > Open Terminal," the shell prompt does not automatically activate the virtual environment. I still need to manually run `source ~/envs/someenv/bin/activate` in the terminal to activate the virtual environment.

Another approach is to activate the virtual environment in a separate shell and then launch PyCharm from that environment. While this works, it is cumbersome and can lead to issues if I switch between different environments or projects in PyCharm, as I may end up using the wrong environment.

Is there an easier way to have the "Tools > Open Terminal" option automatically activate the virtual environment?

**Solution:**

I encountered a similar issue with PyCharm (version 2021.2.2) where the virtual environment was not being activated in the integrated terminal. Hereâ€™s how you can resolve this:

1. Go to **Settings** (or **Preferences** on macOS).
2. Navigate to **Tools > Terminal**.
3. At the bottom of the window, ensure that the **"Activate virtualenv"** checkbox is ticked. If it is not, tick it.
4. In the middle section of the same window, check the **Shell path**. Ensure it is set to `cmd.exe` (on Windows) or the appropriate shell for your operating system. You can select the correct shell from the dropdown list.
5. Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the changes.
6. Close the currently open terminal and re-open it by going to **Tools > Open Terminal**.

You should now see the virtual environment activated, indicated by the presence of `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.
