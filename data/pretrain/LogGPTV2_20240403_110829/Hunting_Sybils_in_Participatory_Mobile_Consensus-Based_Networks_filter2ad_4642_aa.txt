in order to provide wide, dynamic coverage, relaying their data to
one centralized Server. Recent advances in smartphone technology
have immensely benefitted the approach; sensors may nowadays
be smartphone-mountable[3, 4] and offload their computation and
communication to the device. This has been used to bundle sensor
data with smartphone-provided timestamps and location informa-
tion, facilitating the Server’s decision-making.
In many contexts, users may participate in the network anony-
mously in order to preserve the privacy of their time-stamped lo-
cation data[5, 6]. Specifically, messages sent from a participating
user (one who voluntarily attaches the sensor to their smartphone)
would not contain information that may personally identify them,
but would contain an unforgeable identifier for the sensor (to filter
out bogus messages). This anonymity is crucial for ensuring that
sufficient numbers of participants willingly join and become nodes
in the network.
ABSTRACT
We focus on detecting adversarial non-existent nodes, Sybils, in
anonymized participatory mobile networks where nodes support
both a node-to-server and peer-to-peer connection capabilities. As
data-driven decisions within such networks typically rely on local
consensuses, they are susceptible to adversarial injection attacks
which impersonate honest nodes and overpower local data through
forgery.
First, we propose a scheme wherein nodes validate each other’s
presence through local peer-to-peer communication. We then ob-
serve a fundamental information asymmetry between Sybils and
honest nodes, and argue that conventional Sybil detection tech-
niques fail to exploit it. Thereupon, we propose a novel Sybil detec-
tion technique tailored to utilizing claimed location data, introduce
a probabilistic framework for the problem, and design the statisti-
cal approach for finding Sybils. Finally, we compare our detection
algorithm with existing methods through complex simulated Sybil
scenarios.

Unfortunately, this anonymity allows an adversary to participate
in the network and employ deliberate disinformation, corrupting
the Server’s data and misguiding its decision-making. While this
problem is fundamental to anonymous systems, it is greatly exac-
erbated in this case by the fact that messages do not even have
to originate from physical devices[7]. An adversary in possession
of multiple sensors may forge fake messages and inject them into
the network at a purely-software level. In this manner, a far-away
adversary may create a multitude of fake immaterial nodes, referred
to as Sybils[8], that pretend to be sending particular sensor readings
from particular locations in order to mislead the Server.
A further complication arises from an economical sacrifice of
sensor quality for sensor quantity, where systems may prefer a
higher number of cheaper, less accurate sensors. While potentially
creating more data sources, the data from each source becomes less
reliable as false positives and false negatives compound. A typical
countermeasure is for the Server to act upon local consensuses of
nearby nodes[9] instead of individual node data, thereby introducing
some robustness into the decision-making process.
Such consensus evaluations constitute the prime targets for Sybil
attacks however, as the Server may be tricked into dismissing honest
node data as “sensor noise" in favor of a locally-overwhelming mass
of conflicting Sybil data. While significant countermeasures have
been developed for detecting Sybils within the software realm, tech-
niques for detecting Sybils within Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
are still in their infancy, with several unresolved technical chal-
lenges rendering them inadequate for practical implementation.
We believe that until viable solutions to the Sybil problem are
identified, the immense power and cost-efficiency of participatory
crowdsourced systems will remain untapped.

data consensus region (yellow; radius determined by e.g. sensor quality). Sufficient honest nodes (green) within the much-
larger enclosing location validation region (blue; radius determined by P2P communication medium) are used to collectively
detect and eliminate Sybils, thereby purifying consensus data.
Our contribution is twofold. We first devise a novel location val-
idation procedure that addresses the hitherto unresolved technical
challenges, and constructs a trustworthy and informative proximity
graph which may be analyzed in order to detect Sybils. The graph
is formed by instructing nodes to communicate to each other via a
range-constrained peer-to-peer (P2P) medium, with formed pair-
wise connections acting as subjective, potentially-contradictory
evidence of physical presence for the nodes. Secondly, we argue
that standard graph-based Sybil detection techniques are not de-
signed to make use of the additional location information inherently
embedded in the proximity graph, and present our own statisti-
cal framework for analyzing the graph and detecting Sybils. An
example application of our technique is shown in Fig. 1.
2 PAPER OUTLINE
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 3 we outline the
Sybil problem and contextualize it within Cyber-Physical Systems,
with a particular focus on participatory mobile sensor networks.
We present the current countermeasure techniques, identify their
limitations, and outline technical challenges we set out to solve.
In Section 4 we propose our graph construction scheme. We
describe the peer-to-peer communication procedure, detail its in-
ternal algorithm for generating nodewise action sequences within
the procedure, and outline the scheme’s advantages.
In Section 5 we analyze the proximity graph. First, we present
a probabilistic framework for the interpretation of the proximity
graph. Next, we describe how the trustworthiness of a node may be
assessed. Finally, we describe the statistical techniques necessary for
analysis, and describe two algorithms for detecting Sybils tailored
for our proximity graph.
In Section 6 we present our simulation framework and discuss
our results. We demonstrate adversarial strategies that confuse stan-
dard graph-based detection algorithms by removing any obvious
Sybil community structure, and show the resilience of our own
approach to such evasive maneuvers.
We conclude the paper in Section 7, discussing the robustness,
flexibility, and extensibility of our approach.
3 SYBIL DETECTION OVERVIEW
The Sybil problem has been widespread in the domain of social net-
works, such as Facebook and YouTube, where Sybils (fake accounts)
transmit spam, malware, or influence popularity rankings and vot-
ing systems. Due to their inherent emphasis on pairwise relation-
ships between the nodes, social networks lend themselves nicely
to graph representations, with the edges representing those re-
lationships (e.g. undirected Facebook friendship, directed Twitter
following, etc).
As such, many Graph-based Sybil Detection (GSD) algorithms
have been developed as countermeasures, such as SybilGuard[10],
SybilRank[11], and many more. A detailed mathematical analysis
and comparison of the most widely-used algorithms may be found
in this paper[12]. At an intuitive level, these algorithms typically
find communities within graphs, working on the premise of the
preponderance of honest–honest and Sybil–Sybil edges over edges
between honest nodes and Sybils.
3.1 Sybils in Cyber-Physical Systems
In participatory cyber-physical systems, however, there are funda-
mental differences that add to the complexity of the Sybil detection
problem. As these systems are typically concerned with extracting
data from individual participating nodes rather than defining re-
lationships between them, there typically is no natural graph
to perform such Sybil detection on, precluding the use of GSD
algorithms (unlike in the Social Network domain).
Consider two recent participatory mobile sensing systems de-
veloping within the military sector [13, 14]. Their main idea is to
distribute cheap and disposable sensors to ordinary pedestrians
in order to periodically scan their vicinity for traces of explosive
chemicals. The sensors would attach to smartphones which would
transmit their readings to a centralized Server, supplementing them
with a timestamp and location data.
This setup places the Server at the mercy of the smartphones’
honesty, as location-spoofed messages would be indistinguishable

sary would easily be able to emulate an entire cluster of seemingly-
real Sybils and use it to mislead the Server. This would be detrimen-
tal, as such an undiscovered Sybil cluster could conceal the presence
of a bomb by sending an overwhelming amount of benign sensor
readings from its location, or waste police resources by claiming
false alarms.
The physical, real-world nature of these systems also introduces
a sharp distinction between the adversarial nodes that correspond
to physical devices attempting to mislead the Server, and adver-
sarial nodes emulated purely through software without a physical
counterpart. This creates the trichotomy of node types which we
will henceforth refer to in the following way:
• Honest node: honest participant; physical device
• Malicious node: adversarial participant; physical device
• Sybil node: adversarial participant; emulated (no device)
This work focuses on detecting the Sybils specifically, as
Sybils allow an adversary to leverage their power at almost no
cost (as software simulation is cheaper than having physical agents
on the field), and at low risk (as the adversary will not be subject
to physical security on-site).
3.2 Current State of Countermeasures
There are two primary approaches to imbuing such systems with
Sybil detection capabilities. The first approach is to physically
deploy a trusted communication infrastructure, which will addi-
tionally verify node proximity or triangulate their location. These
proposals predominantly come from the domain of VANETs, and
make use of distance-based authentication schemes [16, 17], or
triangulation[18] with directional antennae. While these proposals
may be feasible given a complete overhaul of our city streets with
the deployment of millions of trusted road-side units or antennae,
their practicality in the near term remains unclear.
The second approach is to crowdsource the validation process
itself, requiring no additional infrastructure beyond the regular
smartphones already available to the participating nodes. The key
idea is to let nodes vouch for each other’s presence, form a graph
of evidence of which nodes can attest to the physical presence
of which other nodes, and perform Sybil detection on this graph.
Techniques for doing this have been proposed in [7, 19] which we
detail next, as they are most similar to our proposed approach.
3.3 Peer-to-peer Proximity Graphs
Range-restricted P2P communication may be exploited in order to
have nodes validate their claimed physical presence to one another.
In previously proposed schemes, any pair of nodes whose claimed
locations are within a threshold (80m) are instructed to establish a
pairwise connection and perform a key exchange. This is done by
one node broadcasting its server-provided one-time secret key over
the P2P medium (e.g. WiFi Direct or Bluetooth) to the other, which
in turn reports it to the Server, or notifies it that the connection
had failed. Upon a success, a new undirected edge between these
two nodes is permanently added to the proximity graph; upon a
failure, nothing is done.
Assuming perfect P2P communication and an unsophisticated
adversary, all honest–honest and honest–malicious edges would
form, as the honest nodes would indeed be within the communica-
tion range. Sybil–Sybil and Sybil–malicious edges could freely form
as well (at the discretion of the Adversary), as the key exchanges
could happen through external communication, thereby having pair
of Sybils pretending to have seen each other. Sybil–honest edges
would never form however, as Sybils do not correspond to physical
devices and therefore have no way to receive or transmit signals
on the P2P medium.
As these edges individually form one-by-one, the tight commu-
nity characteristics of the Sybils would reveal themselves over time.
The Sybils could subsequently be identified by GSD algorithms, so
long as there is a sufficiently-larger community of honest nodes.
3.4 Technical Challenges
We outline a number of shortcomings of the current pairwise prox-
imity scheme that render it impractical, ineffective, and vulnerable
to circumvention:
(1) Short Longevity: It severely strains devices. The one-by-
one formation of pairwise connections results in a constant
usage of every device’s WiFi transceiver, perpetually disrupt-
ing normal user service while additionally draining power.
This inconvenience may frustrate new users from participat-
ing in the system and reduce the longevity of the devices.
(2) Low Privacy: It requires accumulated historical data.
Even anonymous records may succumb to statistical analysis.
As a specific example, many short paths between two nodes
in the proximity graphs (as constructed in [7]) may indicate
that those two nodes (and hence users) remained in close
proximity for a prolonged period of time.
(3) Weak Security: It is susceptible to Sybil infiltration.
We believe that malicious nodes have incredibly potent capa-
bilities in helping Sybils stay undetected that have hitherto
been unexamined. We outline 3 particular techniques an
adversary may employ to obscure their Sybil nodes:
Impersonation: Anytime a Sybil is instructed to broad-
cast to an honest node, a nearby malicious node may im-
personate the Sybil and broadcast on the Sybil’s behalf,
unbeknownst to the honest node and the Server.
Circulation: Anytime a Sybil is instructed to receive
data from an honest node, a nearby malicious node may
listen on the Sybil’s behalf and circulate the data to the
Sybil, allowing it to claim to have received the data itself.
Dissociation: Sybils and malicious nodes may choose
to dissociate from each other to thwart community de-
tection algorithms, artificially reducing their own inter-
connectivity by failing the communication process.
These techniques allow an adversary to gradually establish
Sybil–honest edges while also reducing the number of Sybil–
Sybil and Sybil–malicious edges, to the final effect of re-
ducing the Sybil clustering behavior. With the clustering
reduced, the detection capabilities of GSD algorithms are
Session 14: CPS Security ASIA CCS ’20, October 5–9, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan734thwarted as there is no longer a clear "Sybil community".
Such an infiltration may lead to detrimental consequences:
Sybil nodes with sufficient accumulated trust would be able
to not only mislead the data aspect of the network, but to
outright bully-out freshly-joined honest nodes who have not
yet had sufficient time to establish their credibility.
3.5 Our Approach
We address these technical challenges in two steps. First, we de-
velop a novel P2P communication scheme to construct a proximity
graph, described in Section 4. Our scheme generates an entire fully-
connected directed graph in one shot in logarithmic time (in
the number of nodes) to greatly reduce device strain and remove
necessity of accumulating historical data.
In Section 5 we design a novel detection scheme around a prob-
abilistic model for edge successes and failures. We argue that the
trustworthiness of a node is captured by the observed log-likelihood
