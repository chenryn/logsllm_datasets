## Abstract
Modern networked devices often use 802.11 wireless connectivity, and their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are visible to passive adversaries, posing security and privacy risks even when link or application-layer encryption is in place. While the most significant three bytes of a MAC address (the Organizationally Unique Identifier, OUI) coarsely identify the manufacturer, the allocation of the remaining low-order bytes is less understood. We analyzed over two billion 802.11 frames to extract device and model information, characterizing device populations, vendor address allocation policies, and OUI sharing. Our results show that manufacturers often allocate MAC addresses sequentially, allowing fine-grained device type and model predictions. We validate our inferences on ground-truth data and a third-party dataset, achieving high accuracy. This study highlights the structured nature of MAC address allocation and its implications for security and privacy.

## 1. Introduction
802.11 wireless protocols are ubiquitous in modern networked devices, including IoT devices like mobile phones, media players, access points, printers, cameras, thermostats, and automobiles. Securing these devices is increasingly important due to their widespread use. A specific vulnerability arises from the exposure of MAC addresses, which can be captured by a passive adversary within radio range, even with encryption in place. MAC addresses not only track users but also reveal coarse information about device manufacturers via the OUI.

In this work, we investigate how the remaining low-order bytes of MAC addresses can provide more detailed information about devices. If manufacturers allocate MAC addresses in a predictable manner, such as sequentially, this can enable finer device fingerprinting. For example, within the 24:A2:E1 OUI block assigned to Apple, we find that large contiguous blocks are allocated to specific models like the iPhone 5c and iPad Mini 2. This allows us to infer specific device types and models from MAC addresses alone.

To build this mapping, we collected over two billion 802.11 frames, extracting information from management frames and mDNS packets. Our findings highlight the non-random nature of MAC address allocation, which has significant security and privacy implications. Fine-grained device fingerprinting can support policy-based security and research, but it can also be exploited for targeted attacks and reconnaissance.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 MAC Addresses
Every 802.11 capable device has a globally unique MAC address. The OUI, consisting of the first three bytes, is registered with the IEEE, and the remaining three bytes are assigned by the manufacturer. Our work is the first to examine the allocation policies used by manufacturers within and across OUI blocks. Modern devices also use locally assigned MAC addresses, which can be randomized for privacy. However, techniques exist to derive the global MAC address from the randomized one.

### 2.2 802.11 Management Frames
802.11 management frames, such as probe requests, probe responses, and beacons, are unencrypted and provide valuable information for device fingerprinting. These frames often include WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) fields, which can reveal model-specific information. Up to 8.6% of client devices broadcast WPS fields, and APs also use WPS in probe responses and beacons.

### 2.3 Multicast DNS (mDNS)
Many 802.11 devices use mDNS for service discovery. mDNS messages often contain key-value pairs that identify the device model. For example, Apple devices send mDNS messages with the `model` key, while BlackBerry and some Android devices use `hwid` and `n` keys, respectively. We use public online resources to resolve these model identification strings.

### 2.4 Related Work
Previous studies have shown that hardware identifiers can reveal basic manufacturer details, but resolving MAC addresses to device models has required analysis of higher-level protocols or resource-intensive methods. Techniques using HTTP User-Agent strings or hostnames are prone to inaccuracy. Other methods, such as timing-based analysis of 802.11 management frames, require a steady stream of packet data. Our work improves on these methods by introducing fingerprinting techniques that rely on a single transmitted frame, regardless of type or encryption method.

## 3. Methodology

Our methodology involves collecting and processing 802.11 frames to extract device and model information. We use a combination of WPS and mDNS data to build a comprehensive database of MAC address allocations. Algorithm 1 outlines our frame processing strategy, which includes handling WPS, mDNS, and other relevant data fields.

```plaintext
Algorithm 1: Frame Processing Strategy
if frame = mgmt && mgmt ext = wps then
    src mac ← lookup(wps.uuid e)
    if src mac ̸= universal then
        src mac, wps.* → database
    if frame = WiFi-Direct || WiFi-Display then
        src mac, p2p.* → database
else if frame = mdns then
    model ← lookup(mdns.boardid)
    src mac, mdns.*, model → database
if mgt tag = apple && apple type = 6 then
    if frame = beacon then
        src mac, apple.*, ssid → database
```

## 4. Analysis and Results
We analyzed the collected data to characterize device populations, vendor address allocation policies, and OUI sharing. Our results show that MAC addresses are often allocated in contiguous blocks, allowing for fine-grained device type and model predictions. We validated our inferences on both ground-truth data and a third-party dataset, achieving high accuracy. This structured allocation of MAC addresses has significant security and privacy implications.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
This paper presents a first step in decomposing MAC address structure to provide a more granular fingerprinting technique and highlight security and privacy concerns. Future work will focus on further refining our methods and exploring additional applications of MAC address fingerprinting.
