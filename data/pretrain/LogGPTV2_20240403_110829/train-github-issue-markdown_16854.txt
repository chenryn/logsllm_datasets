Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

---

Assume we have a file `main.rs` that defines a module `foo`, which is located in `foo.rs`. When the package has been previously built, the `rustpkg build â€¦` command only checks the timestamp of `main.rs` and does not verify the timestamp of `foo.rs`. As a result, any changes made to `foo.rs` are ignored.

This behavior also applies to the `rustpkg test` command with respect to `test.rs`.

This version is clearer, more coherent, and maintains a professional tone.
