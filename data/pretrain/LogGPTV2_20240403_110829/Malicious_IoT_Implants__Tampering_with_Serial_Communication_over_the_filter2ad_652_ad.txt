### 6. Discussion

The results of our evaluation highlight two major threats associated with the use of IoT infrastructure:

#### 6.1. Novel Attack Vectors
The emergence of IoT infrastructure, particularly LPWANs (Low-Power Wide-Area Networks), introduces new attack vectors beyond traditional DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on internet infrastructure [3,20]. Our study demonstrates that malicious IoT implants connected to LPWANs can be used to exfiltrate secret information, manipulate the functionality of target devices, and, in the worst case, pose a threat to human safety. These attacks can be performed anonymously, as one can register an account and set up the application without any identification at the website of the LoRaWAN service provider, The Things Network (TTN). Additionally, the attacker can control the implant from a remote location over the Internet.

These attacks are not specific to LoRaWAN and can be executed using other competing LPWAN standards. Traditional mobile telephony infrastructure (e.g., GSM and LTE) does not meet the design criteria outlined in Section 4.1 because GSM or LTE radio transceivers consume more energy, data transmissions incur costs, and SIM card registration typically requires official identification. The effort required to build such an implant is relatively low for experts, as it is based mainly on off-the-shelf components and open-source software. Thus, the widespread adoption of LPWANs opens up new attack vectors that did not exist when traditional mobile telephony was the only wide-area connectivity provider.

#### 6.2. Vulnerability of Serial Communication
Serial communication on PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) is vulnerable to malicious hardware inserted during physical distribution in the supply chain. While our presented malicious IoT implant is tailored to attack I2C buses, similar attacks can be adapted to other serial communication systems, such as UART and SPI, with reasonable effort. However, the applicability of the presented attacks to other bus systems may be limited due to differences in their electronic design. For example, I2C facilitates a communication protocol that allows multiple masters on the bus, which is not easily possible with SPI and UART. Nevertheless, we can eavesdrop on the communication between ICs to exfiltrate information and perform DoS attacks by pulling all lines of the communication system to a low voltage state. In our evaluation, both types of attacks had a significant impact on the target devices' security and reliability.

One might question why attackers would use malicious IoT implants instead of malware. While malware might require less effort, it falls short in several scenarios:
1. **No Internet Connection**: If the target device has no Internet connection, malware has no communication channel to the attacker. None of our three evaluation devices could be remotely attacked using malware due to missing network interfaces.
2. **Direct Interference**: Malware cannot directly interfere with serial communication at the hardware level, which is necessary to circumvent some software protection mechanisms.
3. **Detection**: Malware can be detected by other software, whereas implants are "invisible" at the software level. During our evaluation, the implant did not affect the regular operation of the target device unless the attacker initiated an attack. Since the attacks directly influence communication at the hardware level, an incident investigator would not find digital traces in the log files of the target device's software. The only indications might be exceptions triggered by the MCU and physical evidence, such as the presence of an implant or traces on the PCB indicating that an implant was attached.

### 6.1. Limitations
The threat posed by LPWAN-connected malicious IoT implants comes with several limitations for attackers:
- **Manual Insertion**: Each implant must be manually inserted, making large-scale operations impractical.
- **Expertise Required**: Expert knowledge in electronic engineering and software programming is necessary for preparing and inserting the implant.
- **Space Constraints**: Some potential target devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, may not have enough space within their enclosures to accommodate an implant designed with off-the-shelf components.
- **LPWAN Coverage**: The feasibility of using an LPWAN-connected implant is limited by the coverage of the selected service provider's LPWAN infrastructure.
- **Data Rate Limitations**: LPWANs provide low data rates to achieve their low-power objectives, restricting the amount of exfiltrated data. However, the bandwidth between the implant and the attacker is sufficient for most threat scenarios.

### 6.2. Countermeasures
We analyze various approaches to counter malicious IoT implants, categorized into detection and safeguard mechanisms.

#### 6.2.1. Detection Mechanisms
- **Visual Inspection**: A simple method is to visually inspect the PCBs. This approach does not require expensive equipment but may be cumbersome for products not intended to be disassembled. Future implants may become smaller and harder to detect.
- **Weight Comparison**: Comparing the weight of suspicious products with unmodified ones can be a cost-effective method, requiring only a precision scale. However, this approach is not suitable for heavy devices and can be circumvented by removing small pieces of the enclosure.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Observing side-channel effects, such as power consumption anomalies or emitted radio waves, can help detect the presence of an implant. This method can be automated but requires hardware extensions or special equipment.

#### 6.2.2. Safeguard Mechanisms
- **Tamper-Evident Features**: Adding tamper-evident features, such as sealed packaging or physical security measures like locked encasements or resin encapsulation, can protect the PCB against tampering.
- **Cryptographic Security Measures**: Using authenticated encryption schemes, such as the one proposed by Lázaro et al. [23] for I2C buses, can prevent unauthorized entities from reading or injecting messages. However, this requires all ICs on the bus to implement the encryption mechanism and be equipped with key material, potentially necessitating changes to the I2C specifications.

### 7. Related Work
Previous research has investigated the insertion of malicious hardware at three stages: design, fabrication, and post-fabrication. Hardware trojans, which are malicious modifications of the hardware during the design or fabrication process, have been a focus of extensive research. In contrast, malicious hardware implants are alien elements added to a system after fabrication.

Different approaches to insert malicious trojans include:
- **HDL-Level Modifications**: Modifying the system design at the hardware description language (HDL) level [8,12,13,18,24,41], resulting in additional logic.
- **Gate-Level Modifications**: Implementing hardware trojans at the gate level during fabrication [5,22,36], which modifies existing hardware elements.
- **Analog Circuits**: Adding analog circuits to the system [42].

The first ICs related to hardware implants, known as mod chips [35], were used to modify functions of target systems, such as bypassing copyright protection in video playback devices or enabling restricted features in game consoles. Shwartz et al. [37] demonstrated how aftermarket components, such as third-party touchscreens, could be manipulated to gain root access to mobile devices. Datko and Reed [7] implemented a hardware implant inspired by the NSA Ant catalog [4], which used a GSM interface to exfiltrate data and connected to the target system via a VGA display adapter using I2C communication. FitzPatrick [10] presented proof-of-concepts for hardware implants that connect to targeted systems via I/O pins or JTAG, although these lacked a communication interface to IoT or cellular infrastructure.

### 8. Conclusion
In this paper, we described the implementation and evaluation of the first malicious IoT implant, demonstrating that IoT infrastructure enables novel hardware-level attack vectors. These threats will grow with the expansion of LPWANs, which are expected to supersede mobile telephony networks in providing M2M (Machine-to-Machine) connectivity in the coming years. Future threat models for hardware security must consider these emerging risks.
