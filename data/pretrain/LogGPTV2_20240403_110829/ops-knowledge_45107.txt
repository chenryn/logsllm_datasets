User: I want to perform a comparison of multiple implementations of basically the same algorithm, written in Java, C++ and Python, the latter executed using Pypy, Jython and CPython on a Mac OS X 10.6.4 Macbook Pro with normal (non-SSD) HDD.
It's a "decode a stream of data from a file" type of algorithm, where the relevant measurement is total execution time, and I want to prevent bias through e.g. OS an HDD caches, other programs running simultaneously, too large/small sample file etc. What do I need to pay attention to to create a fair comparison?
Assistant: I would recommend that you simply run each program many times (like 20 or so) and take the lowest measurement of each set. This will make it so it is highly likely that the program will use the HD cache and other things like that. If they all do that, then it isn't biased.
