##### Issue Type:
Feature Idea
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.5.4
##### Environment:
Debian 7
##### Summary:
Hi I'm using Debian and miss to be able to nicely add conditions which
incorporates the state of a package, ie only run a command if a package is not
installed. (in my caste debconf commands should only be run if the package is
not installed)
Got the idea from: #6886 where a condition with debconf will always be
"changed"
##### Steps To Reproduce:
not able to retrieve status of a package to a variable today.
##### Expected Results:
something like this below but you proably know syntax better than me :)
    ansible -m apt -a name=mysql-server state=facts
which would give me a variable back with the status if its installed or not.  
With this variable I can then run a command based upon if the package is
missing or not. (when: variable=true) from my playbook.
##### Actual Results:
not able to retrieve status of a package to a variable
