**Abstract:**
Industry 4.0 is rapidly transforming traditional manufacturing practices. Smart manufacturing technologies, which automate research and development using robotic arms and domain-specific cyber-physical systems, are at the core of this transformation. However, reliance on networked communication increases the risk of security attacks, necessitating the use of secure-by-design platforms or intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS). This paper reports on an ongoing project to design and develop IDS for the Hein Lab, a smart manufacturing research lab in the chemical sciences domain. Effective IDS design requires large, high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which are difficult to obtain. To address this gap, we present the Robotic Arm Dataset (RAD), collected over three months at the Hein Lab. We also introduce RATracer, a non-intrusive tracing framework that can be retrofitted onto any existing Python-based automation pipeline, and two sets of preliminary analyses based on command and power data in RAD.

## I. Introduction
Industry 4.0, also known as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), is driven by fully automated smart manufacturing. These facilities must be secured against both internet-based and off-the-shelf software attacks. Defense in depth is crucial to protect against zero-day attacks. While host- and network-based IDS help minimize unauthorized access, additional safeguards are necessary to prevent automation tools like robotic arms from damaging property or harming humans.

Our work addresses the challenge of designing domain-specific safeguards for a smart manufacturing research laboratory in the chemical sciences domain. Specifically, we collaborate with researchers at the Hein Lab, a state-of-the-art facility at the University of British Columbia that integrates advanced robotics with synthetic organic chemistry. The Hein Lab uses a single lab computer, accessed locally or remotely, to control all CPS devices. We introduce a trusted middlebox between the lab computer and the CPS devices, which accepts only a restricted set of commands (Fig. 1).

**Figure 1. Overview:**
1. Users program and automate experiments using the Hein Lab’s software packages on the lab computer.
2. Python wrappers instrument the software to intercept every device access.
3. An RPC client on the lab computer sends each device command to the middlebox.
4. An RPC server on the middlebox forwards each command to the target device, waits for its response, and sends the response back.
5. The middlebox monitors the power consumption of robotic arms periodically.
6. Data mining: Device commands, responses, and power data are continuously logged.

Designing effective safeguards, even for a smaller state space consisting only of commands, requires high-quality, domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. Unfortunately, such datasets are limited, and available ones, such as AURSAD by Leporowski et al., do not apply to real-world scenarios like ours. Robot arm simulators offer a different approach to dataset generation, but real-world deployments are often heterogeneous, making it challenging to integrate multiple device-specific simulators.

## II. Contributions
This paper summarizes our experience in the first phase of our collaboration with the Hein Lab. Our goal is to provide a robotic arm dataset that supports research in multiple areas. We have focused on anomaly-based intrusion detection, a promising approach given the lack of databases of known attacks and insufficient accumulated experience to produce comprehensive rule sets.

1. **RATracer**: We present RATracer, a non-intrusive robotic arm tracing framework that can be retrofitted onto any existing Python-based automation pipeline. RATracer is published in the Python Package Index under the name niraapad [19].

2. **Robotic Arm Dataset (RAD)**: We open-source all traces collected by RATracer as the Robotic Arm Dataset (RAD) [22]. The dataset includes:
   - Command/response data from multiple robotic arms engaged in various software-controlled chemical synthesis workflows.
   - Interaction data between these robotic arms and other smart devices.
   - Detailed power data recorded from each joint of the Universal Robots UR3e.

3. **Preliminary Analyses**: We show that command sequences in RAD can be interpreted as a language, allowing us to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to model experimental procedures. Our preliminary analyses classify different procedure types and identify anomalous procedure runs in a small subset of supervised data within RAD [6].

4. **Power Data Analysis**: We analyze power data measurements from the UR3e to demonstrate the potential of side channels in identifying command parameters and external contexts, such as payload weights [7]. These results are encouraging because such data can be collected independently of the Hein Lab’s software infrastructure and without RATracer-like frameworks.

## III. Related Work
RAD is not the first open-source robotic arm dataset. Leporowski et al. [33, 34] recently presented a similar time-series dataset based on automated screw-driving operations using the UR3e and an OnRobot screwdriver. Narayanan and Bobba [36] focused on a triangle-shaped laser cutting application using a six-axis Yaskawa Motoman MH5 robotic arm. Pu et al. [38], Duman et al. [27], and Khan et al. [32] studied power, acoustic, and electromagnetic signals from robotic arms, respectively.

Our focus on heterogeneous, real-world, end-to-end workflows sets RAD and this paper apart from prior work. Wu et al. [3, 42, 43] addressed intrusion detection in smart manufacturing using a testbed with a 3D printer, CNC milling machine, heating chamber, conveyor, and three robotic arms. However, their case studies focus on single devices, unlike our comprehensive approach.

In theory, simulators can generate RAD-like datasets, as suggested by Zuo et al. [44] and Vijayan et al. [41]. However, no integrated simulation framework exists today that can provide real-world data on interactions between heterogeneous devices or generate side channel data. For example, we observed significant discrepancies between the power data collected from the UR3e robot and its simulator [2].

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to understand the nature of data originating from real-world automation processes spanning multiple heterogeneous components. Although RAD, RATracer, and the analyses are presented in the context of the Hein Lab’s chemical synthesis experiments, the ideas, techniques, and inferences generalize to other domains.
