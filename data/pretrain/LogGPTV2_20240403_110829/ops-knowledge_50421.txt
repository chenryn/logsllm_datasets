User: How can i run a python script at startup with xubuntu 15.04?
I want to run a script that reminds me of things,like backup,buying thing,calling somebody.
I already have the script,i just need it to start at startup. 
(Python 3.4)
As far i know, xubuntu 15.04 uses systemd.
All the tutorials i found,are for init.d or upstart.
I need one for systemd
Assistant: Found the answer.
You have to go  Configuration/Systemsettings/Session and Startup,
and add the program.
