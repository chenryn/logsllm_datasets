User: I am developing a webpage in django (on my pc with windows 7) and now i need to test some pages in tablet pcs. suddenly the thought came if i can have an access to my localhost in windows from android tablet. is that possible? I am in the same wifi connection in both devices at home. 
i read a lot questions and answers regarding this issue in stackoverflow and other places, but none of them gave me some concrete solutions. 
I have samsung tab 2 10.1 with android 4.0.4.
appreciate any help, thanks
Assistant: Though this thread was active quite a long time ago. This is what worked for me on windows 10. Posting it in details. Might be helpful for the newbies like me.

Add ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*'] in django settings.py file

run django server with python manage.py 0.0.0.0:YOUR_PORT. I used 9595 as my port.

Make firewall to allow access on that port:

Navigate to control panel -> system and Security -> Windows Defender Firewall

Open Advanced Settings, select Inbound Rules then right click on it and then select New Rule

Select Port, hit next, input the port you used (in my case 9595), hit next, select allow the connections

hit next again then give it a name and hit next for the last time.



Now find the ip address of your PC.

Open Command Promt as adminstrator and run ipconfig command.
You may find more than one ip addresses. As I'm connected through wifi I took the one under Wireless LAN adapter WiFi. In my case it was 192.168.0.100
Note that this ip may change when you reconnect to the network. So you need to check it again then.


Now from another device (pc, mobile, tablet etc.) connected to the same network go to ip_address:YOUR_PORT (in my case 192.168.0.100:9595)
Hopefully you'll be good to go !
