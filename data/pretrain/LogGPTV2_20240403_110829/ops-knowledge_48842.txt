**Accessing Django Localhost from an Android Tablet on the Same Wi-Fi Network**

I am currently developing a webpage using Django on my PC, which runs Windows 7. I need to test some pages on a tablet, and I'm wondering if it's possible to access my local development server (localhost) from my Samsung Tab 2 10.1, which runs Android 4.0.4. Both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network at home.

I have reviewed several questions and answers on Stack Overflow and other forums, but I haven't found a clear solution yet. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

**Solution for Accessing Django Localhost from an Android Device**

Although this thread is quite old, I wanted to share the solution that worked for me on Windows 10. This detailed guide may be helpful for beginners.

### Steps to Access Django Localhost from an Android Device

1. **Modify Django Settings:**
   - Open your `settings.py` file in your Django project.
   - Add the following line to allow all hosts:
     ```python
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
     ```

2. **Run the Django Server:**
   - Start the Django development server with the following command, replacing `YOUR_PORT` with the desired port number (e.g., 9595):
     ```sh
     python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:YOUR_PORT
     ```

3. **Configure Windows Firewall:**
   - Go to **Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall**.
   - Click on **Advanced Settings**.
   - In the **Inbound Rules** section, right-click and select **New Rule**.
   - Choose **Port** and click **Next**.
   - Enter the port number you used (e.g., 9595) and click **Next**.
   - Select **Allow the connection** and click **Next**.
   - Give the rule a name and finish the setup.

4. **Find Your PC's IP Address:**
   - Open **Command Prompt** as an administrator.
   - Run the `ipconfig` command.
   - Look for the IP address under **Wireless LAN adapter WiFi**. For example, it might be `192.168.0.100`.
   - Note that the IP address may change when you reconnect to the network, so you may need to check it again.

5. **Access the Django Server from Your Android Device:**
   - On your Android device, open a web browser.
   - Enter the IP address of your PC followed by the port number (e.g., `http://192.168.0.100:9595`).
   - You should now be able to access your Django development server from your Android tablet.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully test your Django application on your Android tablet. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
