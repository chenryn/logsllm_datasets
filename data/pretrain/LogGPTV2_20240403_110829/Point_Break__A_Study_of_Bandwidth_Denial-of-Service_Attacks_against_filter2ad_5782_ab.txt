We summarize the stresser service landscape in Table 1,
although this table does not likely capture all available
stresser sites.
(Since such services are illegal in most ju-
risdictions, they are not widely advertised and there is sig-
niﬁcant churn in the industry, making it difﬁcult to obtain
a comprehensive list.) We emphasize that Table 1 reports
advertised attack strengths. Although others have empir-
ically evaluated the achieved attack strengths of these ser-
vices [74, 75], we elected not to repeat their experiments due
to ethical concerns (speciﬁcally, the strong possibility of in-
curring collateral damage). Previous work has found them

Mean amortized cost ($/target/hour/Gbit/s):
capable of launching bandwidth DoS attacks with measured
attack rates in hundreds of Gigabits per second [74, 75] .
In our analysis in subsequent sections, we consider the av-
erage amortized cost of the attacker to ﬂood a single target
(i.e., IP address) with 1 Gbit/s of attack trafﬁc for an hour;
we found this to be $0.74. Although at ﬁrst blush, this may
appear unrealistically inexpensive, we note that this is more
costly than obtaining the equivalent bandwidth from legiti-
mate dedicated hosting providers; see §3.2. In §4, we eval-
uate the cost of using stresser services to overwhelm the ca-
pacity of the Tor network en masse, and consider more efﬁ-
cient and targeted stresser attacks in §5 and §6.
3.2 Dedicated Server Costs
Online dedicated hosting services provide customers with re-
motely located and managed physical machines. Users have
full access to the provisioned resources such as CPU, RAM,
and disk storage, at a ﬁxed cost. Typically, providers impose
some limits on the amount of monthly trafﬁc, and charge
different rates for the provisioned network bandwidth. Ta-
ble 2 reports the pricing schemes for several popular dedi-
cated hosting services. The average amortized hourly cost
for transferring data at 1 Gbit/s is $0.70.
Unlike stresser services, dedicated hosting services do not
cater to network attackers. They are much more likely to po-
lice their trafﬁc and terminate service for customers who are
obviously attempting to perform ﬂooding attacks. We thus
do not consider their use for na¨ıve ﬂooding of Tor compo-
nents (e.g., to overwhelm their capacity).
Dedicated servers are well-suited for an attacker who is
looking to disrupt the Tor network by leveraging some as-
pects of Tor’s design or protocols. The attacker can use the
resources provided by dedicated hosting services to launch
such application layer bandwidth DoS attacks on Tor. We
explore how dedicated hosting services could serve as a plat-
form for causing severe congestion of Tor relays in §7.
4 Na¨ıve Flooding Attacks against Tor Relays
A straightforward method of attacking Tor is to ﬂood relays
with spurious trafﬁc. In this section, we analyze the cost of
using stresser services to disrupt the entire Tor network.
Saturating Links: To simplify our analysis, we assume a
model of the Internet in which every node i has a ﬁnite band-
width capacity Ci, measured in bits per second (bit/s). We
do not consider asymmetric bandwidth since Tor relays re-
ceive and send trafﬁc in roughly equal proportions; if node
i has asymmetric connectivity, we can consider Ci to be the
minimum of its upstream and downstream capacities.
We assume that an adversary can effectively deny service
to a targeted node v if (i) it can cause trafﬁc to arrive at the
target at a rate greater than Cv and (ii) such trafﬁc cannot be
ﬁltered upstream. Importantly, the second criterion requires
the attacker to initiate a distributed DoS attack from multiple
sources (i.e., IP addresses) that cannot easily be enumerated
or blocked. Additionally, the communication should resem-
ble legitimate trafﬁc (e.g., be directed at a relevant TCP port).
Stresser services generally meet these requirements.
Our ﬁrst assumption—i.e., a node v effectively becomes
unusable if it receives attack trafﬁc at a rate greater than Cv—
is admittedly an oversimpliﬁcation. However, we speculate
that saturating v’s link would induce a high packet loss rate of
50% or more for legitimate clients, since such clients would
have to compete for v’s connectivity. TCP performs poorly
at such high packet loss rates [61, 68].1 Stresser services
offer attack rates that vastly exceed the estimated bandwidth
capacities of Tor relays.
Estimating Tor Relay Link Capacity: For a successful
ﬂooding attack, the rate at which the attack trafﬁc arrives at
1Computing TCP’s performance for a given packet loss rate is complex
since there are a variety of TCP congestion control algorithms (e.g., Tahoe,
Reno, etc.). However, we can derive the theoretical network limit based on
the Mathis et al. [61] formula: assuming an average RTT of 40ms, an MSS
√
of 1460B, and a 50% loss rate, the maximum possible throughput achievable
by TCP is just (MSS/RTT)· (1/
loss) = 0.41 MiB/s.

the target should be equal to or greater than the target’s net-
work link capacity. Importantly, we distinguish between the
link capacity Cv of a victim relay and its effective through-
put, the latter of which depends on rate limiting, its selec-
tion probability, etc. The ﬂooding attack instead depends on
overwhelming the victim’s actual connectivity, i.e., Cv.
Unfortunately, Tor relays do not publish their link capac-
ities. To estimate a given relay’s link capacity, we consider
its bandwidth history as recorded in the previous year (from
2017-11-01 to 2018-11-01) by the Tor Metrics Portal [11].
For each day, we ﬁnd the maximum observed bandwidth for
the relay and map this bandwidth to the next highest value in
a ﬁxed set of bandwidth offerings that are commonly avail-
able: 1, 10, 100, 200, 500, 1,000 and 10,000 Mbit/s. For
example, a relay with a maximum observed bandwidth of
1,200 Mbit/s will be considered to have 10 Gbit/s network
link. We thus assume that an attacker must direct 10 Gbit/s
of attack trafﬁc to overwhelm the relay’s capacity. We again
emphasize that this is an estimate; the actual capacity at any
given time may vary signiﬁcantly if relay operators conﬁgure
Tor bandwidth limitation options (operators can set instanta-
neous bandwidth rate limits and total monthly usage limits).
Attack Cost: We estimate that the total link capacity across
the Tor network ranged from 429 to 575 Gbit/s over the year;
for our analysis, we use the average of 512.73 Gbit/s. We
require that at least one stresser account be used for each
Tor relay (since stresser services usually restrict the number
of targets to one). Additional stresser accounts are needed
to saturate relays with high bandwidth capacities. Applying
our cost model, an attacker can use stresser services to ﬂood
all relays in the Tor network at a cost of about $10K/hr. (or
$7.2M/mo.). An adversary can roughly halve its costs by tar-
geting only exit relays, which are required for trafﬁc exiting
the network. Overall, however, we ﬁnd that disrupting Tor
by renting stresser services is an expensive proposition, only
potentially viable for a nation-state adversary.
Limitations: A limitation of our analysis is that it is not
based on empirical evidence (since we were not willing to
use such services) and relies on advertised attack rates. Al-
though Santanna et al. have found such services to reason-
ably deliver high-bandwidth [74, 75], it is possible that they
provide a much lower attack strength than advertised. We
also rely on the assumption that packets are not ﬁltered up-
