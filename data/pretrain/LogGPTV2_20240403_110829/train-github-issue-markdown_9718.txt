# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18363.900
    PowerToys version: 0.19.0
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug: PowerToys Run, Keyboard Manager
# What I did
  1. I changed the keyboard shortcut for PowerToys Run to Win+R (aka the current Run shortcut)
  2. After I saw that Run still triggered on Win+R, I changed the PowerToys Run shortcut back to Alt+Spacebar
  3. I then used Keyboard Manager, so that Win+R would trigger Alt+Spacebar
# Expected behavior
At first, the system behaved as expected, triggering PowerToys Run whenever I
hit Win+R
# Actual behavior
Eventually, whenever I hit the spacebar, PowerToys Run would launch. I would
change settings in PowerToys to prevent this behavior. My fixes (which
included removing the shortcut remap) worked at first, but eventually, the bug
would be triggered again. I tried deleting the PowerToys app and reinstalling
it. Since the data from my previous installation is backed up, I'm worried
that the bug will come again, forcing me to disable PowerToys Run completely.
