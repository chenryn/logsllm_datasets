## Dangerous Minds: The Art of Guerrilla Data Mining
### DEFCON 2009

---

### Background
**Security Analytics:**
- **Concept:** Utilizing data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of security.
- **Presentation Overview:** Techniques and theories that can be applied to security.

**This Talk:**
- **Objective:** Transition from theoretical concepts to practical applications.
- **Scope:** Provide real-world scenarios and examples to help you leverage these techniques in your research.

---

### Introduction
- **Traditional Warfare vs. Information Security:**
  - Both fields share significant similarities.
  - Reconnaissance, information gathering, and espionage are crucial in both battle tactics and cybersecurity.

---

### This is Sparta!
- **Reference:** *300* (film)
- **Example:**
  - **Spartans:** They knew and understood the terrain.
  - **Persians:** They won not by sheer numbers but because someone revealed a hidden pass to them.

---

### Information Security
- **Application:**
  - Not limited to "hacking" systems.
  - The more information you have, the better equipped you are to protect your organization.
  - Effective policies and procedures, along with the right tools and techniques, are essential based on the information at hand.

---

### Words of Wisdom
- **Sun Tzu's Insight:**
  - "If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles."

---

### Information Warfare
- **Definition:**
  - The strategic use and management of information to gain a competitive advantage over an opponent.
  - Without proper analysis, data (1s and 0s) is meaningless. Analysis transforms data into actionable intelligence.

---

### The Business of Information Warfare
- **Key Players:**
  - CIA
  - FBI
  - NSA
  - Information Awareness Office
  - Foreign Governments

---

### Government Projects
- **Notable Initiatives:**
  - ECHELON
  - TALON
  - ADVISE
  - MATRIX
  - Able Danger
  - These are large-scale endeavors.

---

### Challenges
- **Data Volume:**
  - There is an overwhelming amount of data.
  - Limited resources to process and analyze this data.

---

### The Veritas Project
- **Meaning:** "Veritas" is Latin for "Truth."
- **Project Overview:**
  - Based on the premise of threat intelligence.
  - Emphasizes community sharing and the use of freely available tools, technologies, and techniques.
  - Collaborations include the Hawaii Honeynet Project and Secure-DNA.

---

### An Analogy
- **Information Warfare:**
  - **Field Agents:** Gather data.
  - **HQ:** Central repository for data.
  - **Analysts:** Process and interpret data.
  - **Decision Makers:** Act on the intelligence provided.

---

### Framework
- **Components:**
  - **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant data.
  - **Data Storage:** Storing data in appropriate formats.
  - **Data Analysis:** Transforming data into meaningful insights.
  - **Decision Making:** Acting on the analyzed data.

---

### Data Collection
- **Sources:**
  - Forums
  - Bulletins
  - Chat logs
  - News articles
  - Blogs
  - Word documents
  - The more data collected, the better the results.
  - However, it's not as easy unless you have the capabilities of a tech giant like Google.

---

### Data Storage
- **Options:**
  - Relational databases
  - Flat files
  - This is generally the easiest part of the framework.

---

### Analysis
- **Importance:**
  - The most critical aspect of the framework.
  - Involves processing large amounts of data to make it meaningful.
  - **Techniques:**
    - K-Means
    - Neural Networks
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Many others
  - While challenging, there are numerous tools available to assist.

---

### Data Analysis Tools
- **Free and Useful Tools:**
  - Text Garden
  - Ontogen
  - Weka
  - Rapid Miner
  - Tanagra
  - Orange
  - MEAD

---

### Human Factor
- **Necessity:**
  - Humans are essential for interpreting results and analysis, which translates into actionable intelligence.

---

### Demo Scenarios
- **Purpose:**
  - Present scenarios that can serve as templates for your own research.

---

### Applications
- **Examples:**
  - **Trends Research:**
    - Track increases in chatter over time.
    - Identify relationships between topics.
    - **Framework:**
      - **Data Collection:** Crawlers (News articles, Forums)
      - **Data Storage:** MySQL
      - **Analysis:** Text Garden (html2txt, txt2bow, bowkmeans)
      - **Decision Making:** Analyst
  - **Malware Taxonomy:**
    - Group similar malware together.
    - **Framework:**
      - **Data Collection:** Notes from Malware Analysts
      - **Data Storage:** Flat files
      - **Analysis:** Ontogen
      - **Decision Making:** Varies
  - **Monitoring â€“ Persons of Interest:**
    - Monitor chat logs to identify and track "persons of interest" and their connections.
  - **Corporate Intelligence:**
    - Use data mining to profile companies and determine strategic approaches.
  - **Opinion Polls:**
    - Analyze public sentiment, such as during Obama's Town Hall Meeting, to understand concerns (e.g., healthcare).

---

### Conclusion
- **Insights:**
  - Data mining and AI are powerful tools in the realm of information security.
  - The Veritas Project aims to democratize these tools and techniques.
