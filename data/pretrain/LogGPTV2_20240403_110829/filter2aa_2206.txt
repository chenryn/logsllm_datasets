Dangerous Minds:  The Art of 
Guerrilla Data Mining
DEFCON 2009

Background
 “Security Analytics”: 
 Concept of using data mining and AI in 
security
 Presented techniques and theories that 
we could use
 This Talk:
 Move from theory to practical 
applications
 Provide scenarios and examples to 
leverage these techniques for your 
research

Introduction
 Traditional warfare vs. Information 
Security
 Very similar
 Reconnaissance, information gathering, 
and espionage play an important part in 
battle tactics

This is Sparta!
 Anyone watched 
300?
 Spartans: they knew 
and understood the 
terrain
 Persians:  They did 
not win because of 
overwhelming 
numbers, they 
actually won because 
someone told them 
about a hidden pass.

Information Security
 In information security:
 Not only in “hacking” systems 
 The more information you have, you’ll 
have a better chance to  protect you 
organization
 Drafting good policies and procedures 
as well as picking the correct tools and 
techniques based on the information 
that you have.

Words of Wisdom
 It is said that if you know your 
enemies and know yourself, you 
will not be imperiled in a hundred 
battles - Sun Tzu

Information  Warfare
 Information Warfare
 The use and management of 
information in pursuit of a competitive 
advantage over an opponent
 Information are just 1’s and 0’s if not 
used properly
 Analysis makes information 
meaningful - INTELLIGENCE

The Veritas Project
 Veritas is latin for “Truth”
 The Veritas Project
 Modeled in the same general threat 
intelligence premise
 Primarily based on community sharing 
approach and using tools, 
technologies, and techniques that are 
freely available.

Data Collection
 Sources of Data
 Depends on what you want to research
 Forums
 Bulletins
 Chat logs
 News
 Articles
 Blogs
 Word documents
 The more you can gather, the better 
results
 It’s not as easy, unless you’re Google

Data Storage
 Information can be stored in:
 Relational databases
 Flat files
 Possibly the easiest part of all this
DEFCON 2009
16
Analysis
 Possible the most important aspect of the 
framework
 Crunching large amount of data. 
 Making data and information meaningful
 Some Data Mining and Artificial 
Intelligence Concepts
 K-Means
 Neural Networks
 SVM
 A lot more
 Not too easy but there are a lot of tools 
out there
