This characteristic is particularly significant for mobile devices such as laptops and PDAs that rely on battery power.

Unlicensed use of TV white spaces is particularly well-suited for:

- **Media Distribution:** The enhanced bandwidth provided by the TV band spectrum will facilitate access to and management of electronic media. This includes next-generation home media centers that offer on-demand access to stored or streamed content, including high-definition video, from multiple devices. Additionally, the increased bandwidth will make it more feasible for schools and other non-profit entities to provide enterprise tools such as videoconferencing at various receive points within their locations.

- **Point-to-Multipoint Systems:** The favorable propagation characteristics of TV band signals will enable more effective broadband access. Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs) can reach more customers with less infrastructure, making broadband deployment substantially cheaper and quicker.

- **Neighborhood Mesh Networks:** The range provided by TV band devices can be used to create self-organizing mesh networks free from subscription services and monthly charges. These networks can significantly reduce deployment costs for municipal mesh network operators and help create ad hoc public safety networks. Specifically, mesh networks are well-suited for:
  - **Emergency Communications:** Mesh networks can be rapidly deployed in emergencies when existing communications infrastructure is damaged or unavailable.
  - **Supplementing Existing Infrastructure:** Public safety personnel can use IP-based mesh networks to supplement dedicated public safety networks, providing local interoperability at emergency sites.
  - **Enhancing Resiliency:** Mesh networks have no single point of failure, ensuring reliability.

Many of these advantages cannot be realized through licensed use. While there are some benefits to licensed services, the Commission has already committed to licensing 60 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band following the DTV transition auctions. The question remains whether the distinct benefits of unlicensed services will also be made available. The Coalition supports the licensed model for the spectrum to be cleared in the DTV transition but urges the Commission to reaffirm its initial determination that the unlicensed model is most appropriate for the TV white spaces.

### 25
The Further Notice overstates the possible benefits of licensed services in the TV white spaces. The Commission notes that one possible justification for licensed use is the facilitation of locating and terminating sources of harmful interference. However, this rationale assumes that interfering licensed uses will be easier to shut off and that unlicensed users will have a greater incentive to interfere—neither of which is true.

Once a licensed device is available in the marketplace, the licensee has no viable means to detect or prevent individual non-conforming interfering uses. For example, users may tamper with licensed devices such as cell phones, and these devices can fail, causing harmful interference without the license holder's knowledge. Even if an incumbent licensee suspects harmful interference from a licensed white space device, the white space licensee can do little to address the issue short of shutting down a significant portion of its network, thereby affecting many unoffending devices.

Furthermore, it is not clear that licensed operators would have a greater economic incentive to ensure that deployed devices do not cause harmful interference. The Commission’s primary mechanisms for safeguarding against harmful interference—equipment authorization and fines—are not dependent on the licensing of services. Because licensed devices can be modified to work beyond the scope of their authorizations just as easily as unlicensed devices, enforcement, not licensing, will be the primary deterrent to interference regardless of the spectrum allocation approach adopted by the Commission.

The Coalition’s members, who have invested substantial resources in the research and development of unlicensed TV band devices, are highly motivated to ensure that these devices do not cause harmful interference. The high-tech industry has the expertise to ensure that devices do not cause harmful interference and would not endanger substantial investments by creating the risk of FCC enforcement.

The Coalition also notes that its members have an economic incentive to ensure a balance between allowing innovative new services and protecting incumbent licensees. For example:
- **Philips, Dell, and HP** are global leaders in developing and manufacturing digital televisions, collectively representing over 13 percent of the market for plasma and LCD TVs in North America.
- **Philips, Dell, and HP** also produce media center devices that enable viewing and recording of over-the-air DTV content.
- **Microsoft** creates the software that powers these media center devices, such as Windows XP Media Center Edition, which allows devices to store, rewind, and fast forward over-the-air DTV content.
- **Intel** develops and markets tuner and demodulator products for digital televisions.

This interest in the success of both broadcast TV and unlicensed technology stands in contrast to the broadcasters and other advocates of a licensing regime, who have no market incentive to balance the needs of incumbents with obtaining substantial innovative value from the white spaces.

Finally, the parameters proposed by the Coalition eliminate concerns about a "tragedy of the commons," where individual unlicensed users might transmit at the greatest possible power. The substantial success of unlicensed operations in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands demonstrates that the opposite is true. The same success can be achieved for unlicensed devices in the TV white spaces if the Commission allows it.

### 26
The Commission speculates that a licensing regime may provide the most effective means of balancing competing uses in areas where the amount of unused TV band spectrum is low. However, there is no reason to believe that numerous unlicensed devices will be unable to share the TV white spaces effectively. For example, after the DTV transition, even in crowded markets like Trenton, New Jersey, which is served by numerous licensees in nearby cities, the New America Foundation has concluded that approximately 90 MHz of post-transition white space spectrum will be available for use by personal/portable devices. Unlike TV stations, unlicensed devices will not always be transmitting. Technological advancements in telecommunications and computer networks, including multiplexing, have been driven by the need to share scarce resources. If white space spectrum in congested areas is heavily used by unlicensed devices, this scenario may encourage the development of technologies that use the spectrum more efficiently.

### IV. Other Issues

#### A. Out-of-Band Emission Limits
The Commission has proposed requiring TV band devices to comply with the out-of-band emission limits set forth in Section 15.209 of its rules and seeks comment on whether different emission limits would be more appropriate. With the exception of adjacent channel interference, the Coalition believes that Section 15.209 provides adequate out-of-band emission limits.

#### B. Direct Pickup Interference/Receiver Desensitization
The Commission seeks comment on whether the operation of unlicensed devices in close proximity to TV receivers would adversely affect them, either through direct signal pickup through the receiver chassis or by desensitizing the receiver so that it receives harmful interference on each channel. The Coalition has confirmed that, by operating within the proposed parameters, devices will not cause these problems and looks forward to the Commission’s testing, which the Coalition is confident will verify these results.

#### C. Wireless Microphones
The Coalition has determined that the proposed -114 dBm threshold detection sensitivity used to protect TV receivers is also adequate to protect licensed wireless microphones. Theoretical and empirical studies conducted by the Coalition verify that the proposed operating parameters will protect licensed wireless microphones. The Coalition is confident that Commission testing will confirm that the prototype will provide wireless microphone licensees with the necessary interference protection.

#### D. Unlicensed Use in Border Areas
The Commission has observed that, under current international agreements with Canada and Mexico, certain low-power TV operations must be referred to these countries for prior approval. Specifically, low-power TV assignments within 20 miles of the Canadian border and 25 or 37 miles (for low-power UHF and VHF, respectively) from the Mexican border require prior approval for operation. The Commission seeks comment on whether these agreements must be modified before unlicensed operations can commence in these areas.

The Coalition believes that the pre-approval requirements in these agreements do not need to be modified. The concerns raised by the Commission relate to restrictions on TV station operations, not on other devices that operate in the TV bands using significantly less power than even low-power TV stations. More fundamentally, the use of TV band devices is not inconsistent with these agreements, assuming the devices use spectrum sensing to avoid Mexican and Canadian TV signals. The Coalition’s prototype device is designed to detect both digital and analog television signals, ensuring that unlicensed use of the TV white spaces can proceed without modifying these agreements.

### Conclusion
The Commission’s decision to allow wireless devices to access unused broadcast TV spectrum is a promising first step toward providing ubiquitous and affordable Internet access and fostering the development and deployment of innovative new consumer technologies and services. These goals can only be realized if the Commission adopts minimal technical and operational rules that will allow innovation to flourish. Each implementation decision should provide incumbent licensees with adequate protection from harmful interference while maximizing the potential uses of the TV white spaces by adopting flexible rules that will allow for the widespread deployment of personal/portable devices. The Commission should reaffirm its initial determination that the unlicensed model is most appropriate for the TV white spaces, concurrently authorize the use of personal/portable and fixed/access devices, and adopt spectrum sensing with a detection threshold of -114 dBm as a means to avoid harmful interference. By doing so, the Commission can help ensure that all Americans derive substantial benefit from this valuable public resource and that the U.S. leads the way in technological innovation in this space.
