57  This last characteristic becomes an especially significant consideration for mobile devices such as 
laptops and PDAs that rely on battery power.

Unlicensed use of the TV white spaces is particularly well suited for:  
• Media distribution.  The improved bandwidth made possible by use of TV 
band spectrum will facilitate access to and management of electronic media, 
enabling innovations such as next generation home media centers that provide 
on-demand access to stored or streamed content—including high definition 
video—from any number of devices.  In addition, the increased bandwidth 
afforded to unlicensed devices will make it more feasible for schools and 
other non-profit entities to provide enterprise tools such as videoconferencing 
at a number of receive points at those locations.   
• Point-to-multi-point systems.  The favorable propagation characteristics of 
TV band signals will allow for deployment of more effective broadband 
access.58  WISPs can reach more customers with less infrastructure, and 
broadband deployment becomes substantially cheaper and quicker. 
• Neighborhood mesh networks.  The range provided by TV band devices can 
be used to create self-organizing mesh networks free from subscription service 
and free from monthly charges. They can also substantially reduce 
deployment costs for municipal mesh network operators and help create ad 
hoc public safety networks.  Indeed, mesh networks are particularly well 
suited to public safety and emergency response scenarios: 
o Delivery of Communications at Emergency Sites and in the Event of 
Catastrophic Network Failure.  Mesh networks allow communications 
to be readily deployed in emergencies when existing communications 
infrastructure is damaged or unavailable. 
o Supplementing Existing Infrastructure When There is Degradation.   
Public safety personnel can use IP-based mesh networks to supplement 
dedicated public safety networks and provide emergency site local 
interoperability.  
o Aiding Resiliency.  Because mesh networks have no single point of 
failure they assure reliability.  
As some of these likely applications illustrate, many advantages of the TV bands 
simply cannot be realized by licensed use.  To be sure, there are also some benefits from 
licensed services; however, the Commission has already committed to licensing 60 MHz 
of spectrum in the 700 MHz band pursuant to the upcoming DTV transition auctions.  
58  See FNPRM ¶ 13.   
25
The only question is whether the distinct benefits of unlicensed services will also be 
made available.  Thus, while the Coalition supports the licensed model for the spectrum 
to be cleared in the DTV transition, it urges the Commission to reaffirm its initial 
determination that the unlicensed model is most appropriate for the TV white spaces. 
In addition, the Further Notice overstates the possible benefits of licensed 
services in the TV white spaces.  The Commission notes that one possible justification 
for licensed use is that it may facilitate the location and termination of sources of harmful 
interference.59  This rationale presupposes both that interfering licensed uses will be 
easier to shut off and that unlicensed users will have greater incentive to interfere— 
neither of which is true.   
As a threshold matter, once a licensed device becomes available in the 
marketplace, the licensee has no viable means by which to detect or prevent individual 
non-conforming interfering uses.  For example, the Commission is aware that users have 
on occasion tampered with licensed devices such as cell phones, and also that these 
devices fail from time to time.  Thus, licensed devices can cause harmful interference 
unbeknownst to the license holder.  Even if an incumbent licensee suspects that harmful 
interference is a result of a licensed white space device and notifies the white space 
licensee, there is little the white space licensee can do about it short of shutting down a 
sizeable portion of its network—thus shutting down many unoffending devices to stop 
one offending device.    
59  Id. ¶ 30.   
26
Nor is it clear that licensed operators would have a greater economic incentive to 
ensure that deployed devices do not cause harmful interference.60  While the Commission 
can and does take action against non-conforming uses, neither of the Commission’s 
primary mechanisms for safeguarding against harmful interference—equipment 
authorization and fines—are in any way dependent on the licensing of services.  Because 
licensed devices can be modified to work beyond the scope of their authorizations just as 
easily as unlicensed devices can, enforcement—not licensing—will be the primary 
deterrent to interference irrespective of the spectrum allocation approach the Commission 
ultimately adopts.     
The contention that licensees will have a greater incentive to ensure non-
interfering use fails for the additional reason that those who intend to develop and deploy 
such devices are highly motivated to ensure that these devices do not cause harmful 
interference.  The Coalition’s members have already invested substantial resources in the 
research and development of unlicensed TV band devices, and intend to invest even more 
upon receiving positive indications that such use will be permitted without onerous 
restrictions.  The high tech industry has the expertise to ensure that devices do not cause 
harmful interference, and simply would not endanger substantial investments in such 
devices by creating the risk of FCC enforcement that would destroy the very market they 
seek to create.          
The Coalition also notes that its members have the economic incentive to ensure 
that the Commission finds the correct balance between allowing innovative new services 
60  Compare, e.g., the substantial interference caused by Nextel Communications. Inc. to other licensees—
including public safety operations—in the 800 MHz band. See generally Improving Public Safety 
Communications in the 800 MHz Band, Report and Order, 19 FCC Rcd. 14969 (2004).     
27
and protecting incumbent licensees, as members of the Coalition derive substantial 
benefit from ensuring that demand for over-the-air TV is preserved.  For example: 
• Philips, Dell, and HP are global leaders in developing and manufacturing digital 
televisions, collectively representing over 13 percent of the entire market for 
plasma and LCD TVs in North America.   
• Philips, Dell, and HP also make media center devices that enable viewing and 
recording of over-the-air DTV content. 
• Microsoft creates the software that powers these media center devices.  For 
example, Windows XP Media Center Edition allows devices to store, rewind, and 
fast forward over-the-air DTV content, and includes a built-in antenna signal 
strength meter to allow the user to adjust his or her antenna to get the best 
reception possible.61  
• Intel develops and markets tuner and demodulator products for digital televisions. 
This interest in the success of both broadcast TV and unlicensed technology stands in 
contrast to those of the broadcasters and other advocates of a licensing regime, who have 
absolutely no market incentive to heed the Commission’s concerns about balancing the 
needs of incumbents with obtaining substantial innovative value from the white spaces.     
Finally, the parameters proposed by the Coalition eliminate the fears expressed by 
some that individual unlicensed users will be compelled to transmit at the greatest 
possible power to be heard over the din, creating a “tragedy of the commons”—as 
advocates of a licensed regime would like the Commission to believe. 62  Indeed, the 
substantial success of unlicensed operations in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands 
demonstrates that the very opposite is true.  The same success will happen for unlicensed 
devices in the TV white spaces, if the Commission allows it. 
61  The ability to access over-the-air signals is also a crucial feature of the media center editions of 
Microsoft’s next generation Vista operating system. 
62  See, e.g., Comments of Qualcomm, Inc. at 13 (filed Nov. 20, 2004); MSTV and NAB Comments at 25.     
28
The Commission also speculates that a licensing regime may provide the most 
effective means of balancing competing uses in areas where the amount of unused TV 
band spectrum is comparatively low.63  However, there is no reason to believe that 
numerous unlicensed devices will be unable to share the TV white spaces effectively.  
For example, after the DTV transition, one of the more crowded markets in terms of 
incumbent licensees will be Trenton, New Jersey, which is served by numerous licensees 
in nearby cities including New York, Philadelphia, Newark, and Wilmington, DE.  The 
New America Foundation has concluded that even this crowded market will have 
approximately 90 MHz of post-transition white space spectrum, most of which will be 
available for use by personal/portable devices assuming that such devices are authorized 
to use adjacent channels as the Coalition has proposed.64  Moreover, unlike TV stations, 
unlicensed devices will not always be transmitting.  Finally, the Coalition notes that a 
number of technological advancements in telecommunications and computer networks, 
including substantial breakthroughs in multiplexing, have been driven by the need to 
share scarce resources.  If white space spectrum in congested areas is heavily used by 
unlicensed devices, this scenario may well encourage development of technologies that 
could use that spectrum more efficiently.

IV. 
OTHER ISSUES.   
A. 
Out of band Emission Limits.  
The Commission has proposed to require TV band devices to comply with the out 
of band emission limits set forth in Section 15.209 of its rules, but seeks comment as to 
whether different emission limits would be more appropriate.65  With the exception of 
adjacent channel interference discussed above, the Coalition believes that Section 15.209 
provides more than adequate out of band emission limits.   
B. 
Direct Pickup Interference/Receiver Desensitization.  
The Commission seeks comment as to whether operation of unlicensed devices in 
close proximity to TV receivers would affect receivers adversely, either through direct 
signal pickup through the receiver chassis or by “desensitizing” the receiver so that it 
receives harmful interference on each channel.66  The Coalition has confirmed that, by 
operating within the parameters it is proposing, devices will not cause these problems, 
and looks forward to the Commission’s testing, which the Coalition is confident will 
verify these results. 
C. 
Wireless Microphones. 
The Coalition has determined that the proposed -114 dBm threshold detection 
sensitivity used to protect TV receivers also is more than adequate to protect licensed 
wireless microphones.  Theoretical and empirical studies conducted by the Coalition 
verify that the proposed operating parameters that it has chosen will protect licensed 
wireless microphones.  The Coalition is confident that Commission testing will confirm 
65  FNPRM ¶ 60. 
66  Id. ¶ 62. 
30
that the Coalition prototype will provide wireless microphone licensees with the 
interference protection to which they are entitled.     
D. 
Unlicensed Use in Border Areas. 
Finally, the Commission has observed that, under current international 
agreements with Canada and Mexico, certain low power TV operations must be referred 
to these countries for prior approval.67  Specifically, low power TV assignments within 
20 miles of the Canadian border and 25 or 37 miles (for low power UHF and VHF, 
respectively) from the Mexican border require prior approval for operation.68  The 
Commission seeks comment as to whether these agreements must be modified before 
unlicensed operations can commence in these areas.69   
The Coalition believes that the pre-approval requirements in these agreements  
would not need to be modified.  The concerns the Commission has raised relate to 
restrictions on TV station operations, not on other devices that may operate in the TV 
bands using significantly less power than even low power TV stations.  More 
fundamentally, however, use of TV band devices is not inconsistent with these 
agreements assuming the devices use spectrum sensing to avoid Mexican and Canadian 
67  Id. ¶ 65.

TV signals.  To that end, the Coalition’s prototype device has been designed to detect not 
only the digital television signals that will be used in the United States, but also analog 
television signals that may still be in use in Canada and Mexico after the U.S. DTV 
transition has completed.  Accordingly, the Commission should not require modification 
of either of these agreements before allowing unlicensed use of the TV whitespaces.  
CONCLUSION 
The Commission’s decision to allow wireless devices to access unused broadcast 
TV spectrum is a promising first step toward providing ubiquitous and affordable Internet 
access, as well as toward the development and deployment of a number of exciting and 
innovative new consumer technologies and services.  However, these goals can only be 
realized if the Commission adopts minimal technical and operational rules that will allow 
innovation to flourish.  Each implementation decision the Commission makes should 
provide incumbent licensees with adequate protection from harmful interference, while 
maximizing the potential uses of the TV white spaces by adopting flexible rules that will 
allow for the widespread deployment of personal/portable devices.  In particular, the 
Commission should reaffirm its initial determination that the unlicensed model is most 
appropriate for the TV white spaces, concurrently authorize the use of personal/portable 
and fixed/access devices, and adopt spectrum sensing with a detection threshold of            
-114 dBm as a means by which unlicensed devices may avoid causing harmful 
interference.  In doing so, the Commission can help ensure that all Americans derive  
substantial benefit from this valuable public resource and that the U.S. leads the way in 
technological innovation in this space.
