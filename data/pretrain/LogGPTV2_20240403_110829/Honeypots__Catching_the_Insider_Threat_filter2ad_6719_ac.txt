will not do the trick.  There are technical ways to increase 
the  likelihood.    For  example,  honeypots  such  as  Honeyd 
create virtual honeypots that populate all of your internal, 
unused  IP  space.    Instead  of  having  one  honeypot,  you 
have  thousands  all  over  your  networks.    If  an  attacker 
attempts  to  interact  with  an  unused  IP  address,  the 
honeypot  dynamically  creates  a  virtual  honeypot  that 
interact  with  the  attacker.    This  method  exponentially 
increases the likelihood of capturing attacks.  But we have 
to assume our insider knows what systems they are after, 
and what information they want to compromise.  As such, 
our insider threat will most likely not go after unknown or 
unused IP addresses or systems. 
  Instead, 
As  a  result,  we  will  have  to  modify  our  strategy  for 
deploying honeypots.  Instead of the threat coming to the 
honeypot,  we  have  to  have  some  way  of  directing  the 
attacker  to  the  honeypot,  without  them  knowing  it.    The 
honeypots themselves should also be more advanced.  To 
learn  more  about  the  attacker,  the  honeypots  cannot 
simply  be  basic,  emulated  services. 
the 
honeypots  should  be  more  advanced,  real  systems  with 
the same applications, data, appearance, and behavior the 
insider  expects.    Once  the  attacker  interacts  with  our 
honeypot,  we  have  our  initial  indication  that  we  have  an 
insider  threat.    Based  on  what  the  attacker  does  with  the 
honeypot,  we  can  then  continue  to  monitor  their  actions 
and  then  potentially  confirm  if  we  have  an  insider,  who 
that  threat  is,  how  they  are  operating  and  why.    So,  our 
strategy  for  insider  honeypots  is  not  one  of  just  building 
the honeypot.  Instead, we have to guide our insider to it, 
a  honeypot  realistic  enough  for  the  attacker  to  interact 
with.  
3.2  The Tactics 
Now  that  we  have  a  defined  strategy,  the  next  step 
becomes one of implementing it.  There are two problems 
we  must  solve.    The  first  one  is  the  redirection  of  an 
insider  to  a  honeypot.    The  second  problem  is  one  of 
creating  a  realistic  honeypot  for  the  insider  to  interact 
with.  Combined, these two elements can not only be used 
to indicate an insider threat, but confirm who the threat is,

their identity, motives, and operations.  What we will now 
cover  are  some  theories  on  how  that  can  be  done.    To 
redirect  the  attacker,  we  have  to  better  understand  the 
problem.  Most insiders are after specific information.  In 
many  cases,  they  already  know  what  that  information  is, 
where  it  is,  and  potentially  even  how  to  access  it.    Our 
goal  will  be  to  create  information  that  the  insider  will 
want,  but  information  that  represents  an  indication  of 
insider attack.  This is information that the attacker is not 
authorized  to  have,  or  information  that  is  inappropriate.  
One  of  the  lessons  learned  from  the  ARDA  Cyber 
Indications  and  Warning  workshop  was  that  in  many 
cases 
to  access 
information, but may access information they do not have 
need  to  know.    One  example  is  of  the  FBI  spy  Hansen, 
who  searched  for  his  own  name  in  the  FBI  active  cases 
database.  Though Hansen had authorization to access the 
database,  searching  for  his  own  name  would  most  likely 
be  inappropriate.    This  information  will  then  be  our 
trigger,  our  honeytoken.    If  or  when  the  insider  accesses 
the information, we have our first indication of an insider.  
This  information  can  then  direct  the  insider  to  our  more 
advanced honeypots, specifically Honeynets.   
threats  have  authorization 
insider 
Our  first  example  will  address  advanced  insiders  that 
are  passively  monitoring  network  activity  for  specific 
information.  In many cases, an insider may use a sniffer 
to  passively  monitor  and  collect  sensitive  network 
activity.    This  approach  is  very  safe  as  it  is  difficult  to 
detect,  yet  it  can  give  the  insider  tremendous  amount  of 
information.    Not  only  can  the  attacker  recover  highly 
sensitive  data,  but  who  is  using  it  and  how.    Also,  for 
many organizations, the more trusted the environment, the 
less  likely  you  will  find  advanced  security  precautions, 
such  as  encrypted  communications.    This  makes  it  very 
easy for the insider to passively monitor communications, 
as  the  insider  is  part  of  that  trusted  environment.  
Honeytokens  can  be  used  to  detect  such  activity.    A 
honeytoken  is  created,  one  of  perceived  value,  and 
inserted into network traffic.  If an attacker is monitoring 
that  network, 
likely  capture  our 
honeytoken.    As  such,  our  honeytoken  needs  to  have 
perceived  value,  one  the  insider  will  follow  up  on.    Our 
honeytoken  could  be  a  login  and  password  for  a  system 
perceived  of  high  value.    The  insider  recovers  this  login 
and  password,  and  attempts  to  use  it  on  a  system.  
However, since it’s a honeytoken, we no one is authorized 
to  use  this  login/password  combination.    Any  use  of  this 
honeytoken  on  any  system  is  an  indication  of  an  insider.  
We  can  take  this  a  step  further  by  using  different 
login/password  combinations 
into  different 
networks.    Then,  not  only  can  we  have  indication  of  an 
insider  when  the  honeytoken  is  used,  but  we  can 
determine where the honeytoken was sniffed by matching 
the  different  login/password  combination  to  the  different 
networks it was inserted into. 
they  will  most 
inserted 
To  direct  an  attacker  to  a  honeypot,  we  will  need  to 
have the honeytokens point to the honeypot.  In this case, 
we can actually login to a honeypot using the honeytoken.  
When  the  insider  recovers  the  information  from  the 
network,  not  only  will  they  recover  the  bogus  login  and 
password,  but  they  will  see  it  successfully  used  on  a 
system (such as a database).  What they don’t know is that 
our  database  is  really  a  honeypot.    When  the  attacker 
accesses  the  database  with  our  honeytoken  login  and 
password,  not  only  do  we  have  early  indication  of  an 
insider, but by monitoring their activities on our database 
honeypot,  we  can  learn  more  about  who  the  insider  is, 
their motives, etc. 
A  second  example  can  be  used  for  threats  actively 
looking at documents, or even in emails.  An insider may 
know what resources or individuals are of high value.  We 
can  place  honeytokens  in  those  environments.    Any  uses 
of  those  honeytokens  are  indication  of  an  insider.    For 
example,  perhaps  we  are  concerned  about  an  insider 
accessing  VP’s  or  senior  manager’s  emails.    Inside  each 
of  these  individuals’  mailboxes  we  create  a  bogus  email, 
this  email  is  our  honeytoken.    No  one  should  be  reading 
or  accessing  it.    The  contents  of  the  email  could  be  as 
follows:

combination,  no  one  should  be  accessing  this  document.  
If anyone uses this login anywhere, or if anyone attempts 
to  download  the  rd-2003.summary.pdf  document  from 
any  system,  we  have  an  indication  of  an  insider  threat.  
Even  more,  the  ‘secure’  webserver  http://rd.example.net
is  not  really  a  new  server,  but  is  our  new  honeypot.    If 
anyone  accesses  this  honeypot,  we  have  indication  of  an 
insider.  By monitoring actions on this honeypot, such as 
where they search or the type of documents they attempt 
to  download,  we  can  learn  more  about  who  our  threat  is 
and confirm their actions. 
A  third  example  is  one  of  search  engines.    Insiders 
have  access  to  extensive  amounts  of  information.    As  a 
trusted  member  of  your  organization,  this  is  expected.  
One  of  the  most  common  tools  all  of  your  trusted 
members will use is some type of search engine.  At times 
these individuals will use the search engine as part of their 
work,  to  find  critical  data  so  they  can  accomplish  their 
goals.    But  what  if  an  insider  wants  to  find  or  access 
information  they  should  not  be  doing.    Once  again,  we 
can  plant  honeytokens  within  search  engines.    These 
honeytokens  are  results  that  have  perceived  value  to 
insiders,  however  no  one  has  authorization  to  access 
them.    Any  attempt  to  access  these  honeytokens  is  an 
indication  of  an  insider  threat.    For  example,  perhaps 
there  is  work  in  your  organization  on  prototyping  a  new 
UAV  (Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle).    An  insider  may  be 
interested  getting  all  the  latest  information  on  this 
prototype  to  share  with  a  competitor.    They  may  do  a 
search  on  UAV  prototypes  on  the  companies  internal 
search engine.  The search itself is not an indication of an 
insider threat, as perhaps this individual has authorization 
Figure 2 
In this search we have embedded a honeytoken link, specifically the UAV Prototype Forum at the bottom of the screen.
This  forum  does  not  exist,  nor  is  there  a  Project  Orion.    As  a  result,  no  one  has  a  need  to  access  this  forum.    Any
attempt  to  access  this  is  indication  of  an  insider  threat.    Notice  the  system  it  resides  upon,  rd.example.com,  our
honeypot.

to  conduct  such  a  search.    What  we  can  do  is  create  a 
honeytoken  link,  a  hyper  link  that  the  user  would  be 
attracted  to,  but  has  no  authorization  to  use.    By  having 
them  follow  that  link,  you  now  do  have  an  indication  of 
an insider.  Even more, the honeytoken link can be a link 
to a  honeypot, once again providing bogus information to 
the  attacker.    The  honeypot  can  then  track  the  insider’s 
actions  with  the  system,  helping  to  confirm  who  the 
attacker  is,  and  their  intent.    Refer  to  Figure  2  for  one 
such example of a search resulting in a honeytoken link. 
Honeytokens  are  extremely 
flexible,  we  have 
presented  only  three  examples  of  their  use.    They  can 
easily  be  customized  for  your  environment.    The  key  is 
creating a honeytoken that is of interest or value to insider 
threats, but one they are not authorized, or do not have the 
need  to  know,  to  utilize.    I  feel  that  honeytokens  are 
especially  effective  against  threats  that  are  interested 
specifically 
the 
intelligence  community.    Honeytokens  leverage  the  fact 
that this is what the enemy is interested in.

Once  we  have  an  indication  of  an  attacker,  we  will 
want  to  redirect  them  to  a  more  advanced  honeypot, 
specifically  a  Honeynet.    Honeynets  can  then  be  used  to 
gather  more  information,  including  confirming  if  the 
insider  has  malicious  or  unauthorized  intent,  who  the 
insider  is,  and  perhaps  their  motives.    Honeynets  have 
repeatedly  demonstrated 
capture 
information on external attackers.  We can now apply that 
capability to insider threats.  When the honeytoken directs 
ability 
their 
to 
the  insider  to  the  systems  within  the  Honeynet  we  can 
then monitor their activity.  The Honeynets are crafted to 
meet  the  insider’s  expectations.    For  example,  in  our 
honeytoken example of the system http://rd.example.com,
we create a research and development webserver, perhaps 
complete  with  bogus  files,  documentation,  log  files,  and 
even activity on the system.  We can then monitor which 
files  the  insider  attempts  to  find,  and  what  they  do  with 
them  once  they  download  the  files.    These  files  on  the 
honeypots  can  in  themselves  be  additional  honeytokens.  
When  the  insider  downloads  them  to  their  system  and 
attempts  to  open  them,  these  files  can  call  home  to  a 
central  security  operations  center,  letting  administrators 
know  that  the  honeytoken  was  downloaded  and  opened, 
what system opened it, and so on.
