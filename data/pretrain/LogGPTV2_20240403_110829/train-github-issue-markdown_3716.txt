  * Electron version: 3.0.0-beta.1 to 10
  * Operating System: Windows
**Expected Behavior**  
Shortcuts should be properly displayed in the the app menu.
**Actual behavior**  
Using `CommandOrControl+Shift+O` shortcut, the menu entry shortcut should be
shown as 'Ctrl+Shift+O', but "Ctrl+O" is displayed instead. The shortcut works
fine though.
Same problem with roles. For instance `forcereload` will show Ctrl+R instead
of Ctrl+Shift+R. Again, the shortcut works fine here.
**To Reproduce**  
Simply change a shortcut or a role in the electron-quick-start menu.
**Additional Information**  
Was working fine with latest 2.x version of electronjs.
