This snippet: (Playpen link)
    #![allow(unstable)]
    extern crate test;
    fn main() {
        let a: Vec = Vec::with_capacity(::std::usize::MAX);
        ::test::black_box(a);
    }
Causes the program to close with a SIGILL (Illegal instruction) error. I would
have expected something like a SIGSEGV instead.
