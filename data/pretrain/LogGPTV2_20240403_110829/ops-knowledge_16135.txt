User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to block IPs that cause excessive 404 errors with Fail2ban? I have installed Fail2Ban v0.10.2 on Ubuntu 18.04 with Apache 2.4.29 and enabled the standard ssh and apache jails for basic protection with email notification warnings, when an IP is blocked.

Having a look at the documentation, I was not able to find a relevant filter that would help with the following situation:

I would like to ban IPs that hit the server and produce large numbers of 404 errors due to fake URL requests, which can be a typical spam bot behavior. So ideally, an IP is blocked that produces more than three 404 errors in a row with some exceptions for official search engine crawlers.

Is there a default regex for this situation?

I would appreciate your assistance on how to implement this.

Assistant: I recommend you start by implementing the built-in apache-noscript filter for fail2ban.  To do so, add the following lines to/etc/jail.local`

[apache-noscript] 
     enabled = true 
     port = http,https 
     filter = apache-noscript 
     logpath = /var/log/apache2/*error.log 
     maxretry = 3 
     bantime = 600 


tweak the bantime setting to your liking and consider implementing the recidiv filter/jail for repeat offenders.

Note: there is a possible bug with the filter regex
