User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题CC.NET + SVN : Server certificate issue I am trying to setup Continuous Integration in our office. Being a puny little developer I am facing this supposedly infamous problem:
" Source control operation failed: svn: OPTIONS of 'https://trunkURL': Server certificate verification failed: issuer is not trusted"

So I tried the following solution
- Run CC.NET service (server running as win service) using a domain account (rather than default LOCAL SYSTEMS) and accept cert permanently using command prompt under that user by using svn log/list on the repo.

Doesn't help :(. I am getting the following from my artifact/log files(or dashboard)

ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Core.CruiseControlException: Source control operation failed: svn: OPTIONS of 'https://TrunkURL': Server certificate verification failed: issuer is not trusted (https://ServerAdd)
. Process command: E:\(svn.exe Path) log https://TrunkURL -r "{2010-11-08T02:12:20Z}:{2010-11-08T02:13:21Z}" --verbose --xml --no-auth-cache --non-interactive

We are using VisualSVN Server and CC.NET for this adventure. Tips, suggestions will be highly appreciated. Thanks

Assistant: Pretty easy solution ... see "3. Accept SSL exception for CruiseControl.Net local user account." in this link
