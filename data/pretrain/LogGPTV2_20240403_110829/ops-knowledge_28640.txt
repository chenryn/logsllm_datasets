User: I'm trying to install Python from source on my Mac.  (OS X 10.6.2, Python-2.6.5.tar.bz2)  I've done this before and it was easy, but for some reason, this time after ./configure, and make, the sudo make install puts things some things in my home directory instead of in /usr/local/... where I expect.  The .py files are okay, but not the .so files...
RobsMac Python-2.6.5 $ sudo make install
[...]
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 ./Lib/anydbm.py /usr/local/lib/python2.6
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 ./Lib/ast.py /usr/local/lib/python2.6
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 ./Lib/asynchat.py /usr/local/lib/python2.6
[...]
running build_scripts
running install_lib
creating /Users/rob/Library/Python
creating /Users/rob/Library/Python/2.6
creating /Users/rob/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages
copying build/lib.macosx-10.4-x86_64-2.6/_AE.so -> /Users/rob/Library/
Python/2.6/site-packages
copying build/lib.macosx-10.4-x86_64-2.6/_AH.so -> /Users/rob/Library/
Python/2.6/site-packages
copying build/lib.macosx-10.4-x86_64-2.6/_App.so -> /Users/rob/Library/
Python/2.6/site-packages
[...]
Later, this causes imports that require those .so files to fail.  For
example...
RobsMac Python-2.6.5 $ python

>>> import zlib
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named zlib  
Any ideas what is wrong?
thanks,
Rob
Assistant: Doh.  I've answered my own question.  Recently I created a ~/.pydistutils.cfg file, for some stupid reason.  I forgot to delete that file.  It's contents were:
[install]
install_lib = ~/Library/Python/$py_version_short/site-packages
install_scripts = ~/bin
make install calls setup.py, and this file was overriding the normal setup.py behavior.
