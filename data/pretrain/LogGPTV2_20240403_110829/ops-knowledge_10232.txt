User: I know how to reboot machines remotely, so that's the easy part. However, the complexity of the issue is trying to setup the following. I'd like to control machines on a network for after-hours use such that when users logoff and go home, or shutdown their computers, whatever, python or some combination of python + windows could restart their machines (for cleanliness) and automatically login, running a process for the night, then in the morning, stop said process and restart the machine so the user could easily login like normal.
I've looked around, haven't had too terribly much luck, though it looks like one could do it with a changing of the registry. That sounds like a rough idea though, modifying the registry on a per-day basis. Is there an easier way?
Assistant: Thanks for the responses. To be more clear on what I'm doing, I have a program that automatically starts on bootup, so getting logged in would be preferred. I'm coding a manager for a render-farm for work which will take all the machines that our guys use during the day and turn them into render servers at night (or whenever they log off for a period of time, for example).
I'm not sure if I necessarily require a GUI app, but the computer would need to boot and login to launch a server application that does the rendering, and I'm not certain if that can be done without logging in. What i'm needing to run is Autodesk's Backburner Server.exe
Maybe that can be run without needing to be logged in specifically, but I'm unfamiliar with doing things of that nature.
