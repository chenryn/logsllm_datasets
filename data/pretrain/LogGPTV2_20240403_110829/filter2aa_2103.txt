The core problem with authentication 
and how we can overcome it 
Jason M. Pittman 
  We’re goin’ deep, son! 
  Deep philosophically that is… 
  Tools, who needs ‘em 
  8.75 of 10 zombies do recommend brains 
anyway… 
  Modern (current) authentication 
  Passwords specifically 
  Extends to all types however 
  Current authentication research 
  The theoretical flaws 
  Examples 
  Future Authentication 
  One authentication to rule them all 
  Theoretical implementation 
  Examples 
  Possible security threats in this future 
  Research questions: 
  Why is modern authentication full of fail? 
  Why aren’t researchers addressing this? 
  Research purpose & goals 
  Develop a theoretical approach for future 
authentication 
  Authentication is ubiquitous 
  Authentication is integrated into modern, 
digital life 
  The Singularity may be near… 
  Or it might not and we still need to address 
the core problem 
Authentication Today 
Authentication Primer 
  Authentication is: 
  Something you know 
  Something you have 
  Something you are 
  Something + Something 
  And maybe + another Something 
  Ask yourself, is there a (a priori) 
difference between all these? 
  Passwords are the best example 
  High Usage (user base) 
  High Penetration (most common form of 
authentication) 
  Easy to conceptualize 
  Keep in mind – what we’re going to talk 
about applies to ALL forms of 
authentication! 
  How long have computing systems relied 
on authentication, specifically passwords? 
  1961 – MIT CTSS 
  1978 – Morris invents crypt(3) 
  Two trend defining moments: 
  Transition from single user systems to 
networked operating systems 
  Explosion of authentication as a consequence 
of the Web 2.0/Digital era. 
  How many of us have more than 1 
password? 
  More than 3 passwords? Hands? 
  More than 5 passwords? Hands? 
  More than 9 passwords? Hands? 
  SafeNet/Rainbow Technologies Survey 
(2003) says: 
  1 -2 passwords
 17.7% 
  3-4 passwords
 34.4% 
  5-6 passwords
 18.4% 
  7-8 passwords
 5.6% 
  8 or more
 23.9% 
  Florencio & Herley (2007) demonstrated 
that users type a password ~8 times a 
day 
  The same users retain ~6.5 passwords. 
  Each password is shared between 3-4 
accounts. 
  2003 – 3.5 passwords 
  2007 – 6.5 passwords 
  2011 – ? 
  Pittman’s Law of Passwords 
  The number of passwords per user will 
roughly double every four years. 
Failtistics 101 
  80% of users want something other 
than passwords (Infosecurity Europe 
Survey, April 2004) 
  Largest perceived threats are (TriCipher 
Survey, 27 July 2005): 
  Keyloggers (35%), Password Sharing 
(26%), and Phishing (12%) 
  Over 43% of security breaches related to 
authentication (Camelot Network Security 
& Privacy Study, 25 June 2001) 
  Approx 60% of attacks related to 
authentication (The State of IT Security, 
July 2003) 
  Etc… 
  The majority of recent compromises 
either started from authentication or 
resulted in disclosure of authentication 
data 
  HBGary 
  RSA 
  InfraGard 
  Etc. 
Let’s get this straight… 
  Passwords are the most prevalent form 
of authentication 
  Passwords are responsible for or related 
to a majority of security breaches 
  Users hate them 
  We (researchers and professionals) 
keep telling users and ourselves to 
make even more passwords! 
Welcome aboard the… 
The Problem 
  Current authentication (passwords) are 
indirect forms of identify assertion 
  Software is making the identity assertion on 
behalf of the user 
  The system or application authenticating the 
user has indirect knowledge of the user’s 
true identity 
  Modern authentication uses or relies on an 
indirection assertion of identity 
  You need to confirm the identity of your 
partner/friend/parent when: 
  You cannot see them 
  Voice harmonics are normalized 
  You cannot touch them 
  What if you’re in the middle of two people 
that need to assert identity? 
  Cognitive passwords (Allendoerfer &Pai, 
2005) 
  Proactive passwords (Vu, et al, 2007) 
  Visual/Graphical passwords (Renaud&  De 
Angeli, 2009). 
Is new research effective? 
  Just new ways of doing the same thing 
  Most/All ease the cognitive burden of 
authentication 
  None address the fundamental flaw in 
authentication design 
  Pittman’s Rule of Authentication: 
  Any authentication that abstracts 
(biological) identity is full of fail. 
  Tokens, PKI, Multifactor, Federated, 
etc. 
  Yep… 
  What about biometrics? Surely I can’t 
be serious? 
  Fingerprints as an example 
  Is software telling a system about your 
print? 
  Or is your print telling a system? 
  Threats focus on the software 
middleman 
  E.g., Keyloggers 
  Threats exploit the bad philosophy 
  The software middleman has no capability 
to control 
  Authentication was an afterthought 
  The systems came first, then we had 
authentication 
  The essential model has sprawled 
  We keep changing the paint but we 
haven’t thought about a better house 
  We blame users, not our philosophy 
  The point is to understand the core 
philosophical flaw 
  We don’t want to: 
  Perpetuate authentication sprawl 
  Repeat the mistake when we have a 
chance to avoid repetition 
The Future of 
Authentication 
Where do we need to go? 
  Start thinking 20, 30, 40 years out, right 
now. 
  Kurzweil (and Vinge!) might be wrong 
but they’re definitely right. 
  That is, we might not have uploaded 
consciousness 
  We definitely have exponential growth in 
technology 
Consequences of the 
Singularity 
  Full Transhumanism 
  How are we going to authenticate (bi-
directionally): 
  Immersive Nanotech 
  Our machine “housing” 
  Other’s nanotech & “housing” 
  Sentient machines 
Consequences of the 
Singularity 
  Partial Transhumanism 
  How are we going to authenticate (bi-
directionally): 
  Semi-sentient machines (e.g., the digital 
analogue for protists or bacteria) 
  Genetically engineered material? 
  Non-immersive nanotech 
  Direct assertion authentication 
  Remove the middleware 
  Requires direct interface between humans 
and computing systems/applications 
  Let’s take a classic shibboleth example 
  WWII – lollapalooza (Stimpson, 1985) 
  Also WWII – “thunder”, “lightning” 
  Mash-up with biological or bio-
physiological “signature” 
Direct Assertion Authentication - 
Examples 
  The Matrix – two forms of direct 
assertion are observed: 
  Machines authenticated users via direct 
neural interfacing 
  Key point: access to the Matrix is direct; there 
is no middleman software 
  Humans (Zion) authenticated the Matrix 
“visually” across their broadcast uplinks 
  The déjà vu scene 
Direct Assertion Authentication - 
Examples 
  Surrogates – again, two forms of direct 
assertion authentication 
  The bio-physiological interface between 
user and robotic avatar 
  We infer there is no authentication between 
user and the interface sleds 
  The “visual” authentication between 
avatars 
  Robots are simulacra of the human operators 
  Short answer: no 
  We know how to create the technology 
  Intendix, Emotiv, etc. 
  Future research needs to focus on 
creating systems & applications that 
accept Direct Assertion 
  Threats will focus on the point of 
interface 
  Imagine a type of keylogger that capture 
bioinformation 
  Threats will exploit biological 
vulnerabilities 
  Art that imitates life (e.g., malware today) 
will come back to imitate art.  
  Don’t be shy!
