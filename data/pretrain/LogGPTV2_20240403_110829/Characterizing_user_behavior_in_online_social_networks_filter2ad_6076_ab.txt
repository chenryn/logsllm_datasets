The social network aggregator considers the following
events to determine end of a session (a) when a user closes
the web browser or logs out or (b) when a user does not en-
gage in any action for more than an arbitrarily set period of
time. The system uses a 20 minute threshold. To check the
sensitivity of this session threshold, we examined whether
any two consecutive sessions of the same user had a shorter
interval than 20 minutes. For 22% of all sessions (gener-
ated by 13% of all users), an earlier session by the same

3.2 OSN session characteristics
So, how ofen and for how long do people connect to OSN
sites? To estimate these quantities, we measure the fre-
quency and duration of sessions for each user. We calculate
session duration as the time interval between the ﬁrst and
the last HTTP requests within a session. This approach al-
lows us to infer the duration of any session with two or more
HTTP requests. 87% of all sessions in the dataset contained
at least two HTTP requests.
Individuals varied widely in the frequency with which they
accessed social networks. Figure 3(a) shows the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the total number of sessions
per user. The majority of users (63%) accessed the social
network aggregator’s site only once during the 12-day pe-
riod. The most frequently logging in user accessed the social
network aggregator’s site on average 4.1 times a day. The
total time spent accessing social networks also varied largely
per individual, as shown in Figure 3(b). On one hand, 51%
of the users spent no more than 10 minutes at the social
network aggregator’s site over the 12 days. On the other
hand, 14% of the active users spent in total more than an
hour and the most active 2% of the users spent more than
12 hours (i.e., an average of an hour a day).
Across all users, we did not see a high correlation between
the frequency and duration of OSN accesses (correlation co-
eﬃcient 0.27). This means that the amount of time a user
spends on social networks is not strongly correlated to the
speciﬁc number of times that the user logins to social net-
works. We also did not see a strong correlation between a
session duration and the number of HTTP requests made
during the session (correlation coeﬃcient 0.16). The corre-
lation became relatively stronger when we considered rela-
tively short sessions that lasted less than 20 minutes (corre-
lation coeﬃcient 0.49). This may suggest that long sessions
tend to have idle users. For short sessions, the longer the
session duration, the more activities the session contains.
In addition to widely varying OSN usage per individual,
session durations also varied widely across the four OSN
sites. Figure 3(c) shows the CDF of the session durations
for each OSN site. All four OSN sites exhibit a consistent
heavy-tailed pattern in their session durations. However,
the median session durations vary across OSNs. The me-
dian session durations of Orkut, Hi5, and MySpace are 13.4
minutes, 2.7 minutes and 24 seconds, respectively, indicat-
Figure 2: Number of online users over time
user ended less than 20 minutes prior (i.e., 22% of sessions
were solely identiﬁed by events of closing of web browsers or
logging out). For analysis, we used the session information
that is identiﬁed by the social network aggregator.
Utilizing the session information, we ﬁrst examined the
number of concurrent users (i.e., concurrent sessions) that
accessed any of the four OSN sites (Figure 2). The beginning
of each day is marked in the horizontal axis. We see a diurnal
pattern with strong peaks around 3 PM (in Brazil). At all
times, there are at least 50 people who are using the social
network aggregator service. At peak times, the number of
concurrent users surpasses 700, more than a 10-fold increase
over the minimum. Drops in usage on certain days indicate
clear weekly patterns, where weekends showed a much lower
usage than weekdays. The strong diurnal pattern in OSN
workloads has also been observed in accessing messages and
applications on Facebook [11] and in the content generation
of blog posts, bookmarks, and answers in user generated
content (UGC) websites [9, 13].
To see the usage pattern of heavy OSN users, we also
show in Figure 2 the number of users who stayed online for
more than 1 hour at any given point in time. The daily
peaks for heavy users coincide with the peaks from all users.
The total number of online users and the number of heavy
users showed a strong correlation; the Pearson’s correlation
coeﬃcient was 0.84. This indicates that the ratio between
the heavy users and all users is oblivious to the time of
day. The gap between the two data points in the ﬁgure also

they connect to these sites. In contrast, the median session

lowing section, we take a deeper look into which activities
are popular across these sites.
3.3 Modeling Orkut sessions
To understand the dynamics of user arrival and depar-
ture processes from a system’s perspective, we measure
the session inter-arrival times. Here, we present a case
study for Orkut. More formally, we utilize a time series
t(i), i = 1, 2, 3, ... to denote the arrival time of the ith session
in the trace. The time series a(i) is deﬁned as t(i + 1) − t(i)
and it denotes the inter-arrival time of the ith and i + 1th
sessions, where sessions may belong to diﬀerent users. Fig-
ure 4(a) shows the complementary cumulative distribution
function (CCDF) of a(i), which we ﬁtted to a Lognormal
distribution. The probability distribution function for the
lognormal distribution is given by:
networks or other features of the social network aggrega-
tor then returning back to Orkut. On the other hand, small
inter-arrivals would correspond to users constantly interact-
ing with the social networking site. We found that the av-
erage session lengths and the session starting times are not
correlated (the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient is -0.027).
This suggests that the high variability in session length is
not due to diurnal pattern in user behaviors (as was the
case with the number of active clients), but rather it is a
fundamental property of the interaction of OSN users.
The combination of request inter-arrival time and session
length provides an important model for understanding the
behavior of OSN users, for the two quantities reﬂect the
inherent nature of OSN users and are not related to load
(e.g., the number of active sessions) or time of the day. The
best ﬁt distribution functions presented in this section can
be used to generate synthetic (parameterizable) traces, that
mimic actual OSN workloads.

4. THE CLICKSTREAM MODEL
with parameters µ = 2.245 and σ = 1.133.
To characterize the period of time during which a session
is active, we use a time series l(i) which denotes the length
of the ith session in the trace, deﬁned as the number of
requests in that session. Figure 4(b) shows the frequency
marginal distribution of l(i) for all sessions identiﬁed in the
Orkut trace. We observe a heavy-tail distribution; most of
the sessions involve very few HTTP requests, while a small
number of sessions involve a large number of HTTP requests.
This implies signiﬁcant deviations in the number of actions
(or clicks) users make in a single session.
The distribution was ﬁtted to a Zipf distribution of the
form βx−α with parameters α = 1.765 and β = 4.888. A
Zipf-like distribution suggests that session lengths are highly
variable when users connect to online social networks. Such
high variability is in line with the patterns seen in web surf-
ing. Huberman et al. [15] also found strong variability in
the number of clicks a user exhibits in a session, as well as
when navigating a given website.
The last variable we characterize at the session layer is the
inter-arrival time between requests within a single session.
Figure 4(c) displays the CCDF distribution that was ﬁtted
to a Lognormal distribution, with parameters µ = 1.789
and σ = 2.366. Large inter-arrivals would correspond to
users leaving Orkut pages to spend time on other social
In this section we present a comprehensive view of user
behavior in OSNs by characterizing the type, frequency, and
sequence of activities users engage in. We developed a new
analysis strategy, which we call the clickstream model, to
identify and describe representative user behaviors in OSNs
based on clickstream data.
The modeling of the system implies two steps. The ﬁrst
step is to identify dominant user activities in clickstreams.
This step involves enumerating all features users engaged in
on OSNs at the level of basic unit, which we call user activ-
ity. We manually annotated each log entry of the clickstream
data with the appropriate activity class (e.g., friend invita-
tion, browsing photos), based on the information available
in the HTTP header. Because a user can conduct a wide
range of activities in a typical OSN site, we further tried to
group semantically similar activities into a category by uti-
lizing the webpage structure of OSN sites (i.e., which set of
activities can be conducted in a single page) and manually
grouping related activities into categories.
The second step of modeling is to compute the transition
rates between activities. To represent the sequence in which
activities are conducted, we built a ﬁrst-order Markov chain
of user activities and compute the probability transition be-
tween every pair of activity states. To gain a holistic view,
we built a Markov chain that describes how users transition
from actions in one category to another.

leading to a substantial variation in the set of popular user
activities. Our analysis in this section highlights the simi-
larities and diﬀerences in user behaviors across four diﬀerent
social networks in the trace. Below we present the full click-
stream model only for Orkut, which is the most accessed
OSN in the trace.
4.1 User activities in Orkut
In the ﬁrst step of modeling, we identiﬁed 41 activities
with at least one HTTP request in the clickstream data.
We grouped these activities into the following categories:
Search, Scrapbook, Messages, Testimonials, Videos, Photos,
Proﬁle & Friends, Communities, and Other. Table 2 displays
the list of 41 activities with the number and share of users
who engaged in the corresponding activity at least once, the
number and share of HTTP requests, and the total traﬃc
volume both received and sent by users.
The activity categories listed in Table 2 represent the fol-
lowing features in Orkut, which are described in more detail
in [24, 32]:
• Universal search (activity 1) allows users to search
for other people’s proﬁles, communities, and commu-
nity topics (or forums) in the entire Orkut website. A
search box appears at the upper right corner of ev-
ery Orkut page, allowing users to engage in the search
feature from any page.
• Scrapbook (activities 2 and 3) displays all text mes-
sages sent to a given user. Unlike personal messaging
or email, Scrapbook entries are public, meaning that
anyone with an Orkut account can read others’ scraps.
By default, anyone can leave a scrap in a user’s scrap-
book. However, users can set their scrapbook to be
private, so that only friends or friends of friends in the
network can leave a scrap. Table 2 shows that brows-
ing and writing scraps is one of the most popular forms
of user interaction in Orkut.
• Messages (activities 4 and 5) are a private way to
communicate. Messages can be sent by anyone. Ta-
ble 2 shows that the messages feature is not widely
used in Orkut.
• Testimonials (activities 6 to 8) are a commentary
that users leave about his or her friends. Testimonials
can only be written by friends, but can be viewed by
anyone by default. A user can set options so that tes-
timonials are kept private, and only the user’s friends
can view the testimonial page. Compared to the inter-
action through scrapbook, we see much less interaction
through testimonials.
• The Videos (activities 9 and 10) and Photos (activ-
ity 11–16) categories incorporate all activities in which
users share multimedia content. The photos category
is another popular activity in Orkut. A photo can be
tagged and commented on only by friends. However, a
photo can be viewed by anyone by default. To share a
video, Orkut asks users to ﬁrst upload their videos to
YouTube then to add the video URLs at the Orkut’s
video page.
• Proﬁle & Friends (activities 17–26) represent all ac-
tivities in which users manage their own proﬁles or
visit other people’s proﬁles. Orkut allows anyone to
visit anyone’s proﬁle, unless a potential visitor is on
the “Ignore List” (a list where a user speciﬁes other
users who he or she wants to block from any form of
interaction). Users can customize their proﬁle prefer-
ences and can restrict the information that appears on
their proﬁle page from other users.
A user’s homepage displays a short list of updates
about the user’s friends. The homepage also displays
a short list of friends ordered by login time, where the
ﬁrst person is the one who logged in most recently.
• Communities (activities 27–37) can be created by
anyone with an Orkut account. Community members
can post topics, inform other members about an event,
ask questions, or play games. Users can freely join any
public community, while a moderated community re-
quires explicit approval. Invitations to join a commu-
nity are sent through messages.
The statistics of user activity in Table 2 suggest interest-
ing trends in the usage of Orkut. Browsing (marked with a
* sign) is the most common user behavior, both in terms of
the number of users and the request volume. In fact, brows-
ing accounted for 92% of all requests! Compared to other
non-browsing activities in the same category, browsing typ-
ically engaged 2 to 100 times more users. For instance, the
number of users who ever browsed messages was 13 times
larger than those who sent messages. In fact, other behav-
iors that require more user engagement were less prominent
in the trace; time-intensive behaviors like browse a favorite
video (activity 10) and participation-oriented behaviors like
posting in a community topic (activity 32) are not popular.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate that many Orkut users primar-
ily use the service for passive interactions such as browsing
updates from their friends through homepage, proﬁle pages,
and scrapbook, while occasionally engaging in more active
interaction such as writing scraps, searching, editing photos,
and accessing applications.
4.2 Comparison of user activity across OSNs
To get perspective on how user behaviors vary across dif-
ferent social networks, we repeated the analysis in Table 2
for other social networks that appear in the trace (i.e., MyS-
pace, LinkedIn, and Hi5). All four OSNs exhibited a com-
mon pattern in that the most popular activity was brows-
ing proﬁles. Some activities, however, could only be ob-
served in a subset of these four networks, because the four
social networks provided diﬀerent features to users. For ex-
ample, MySpace uniquely provided Blogs and News pages
and LinkedIn uniquely provided Jobs and Companies pages.
Also video and photo features are not supported in LinkedIn.
Table 3 displays for all four social networks the top ﬁve
categories based on the number of HTTP requests and the
share of corresponding HTTP requests. The statistics are
normalized for each social network, so that the sum of share
of all activity categories is 100% for each social network.
We make several observations. First, the Proﬁle & Friends
category is the most popular across all social networks.
Users commonly browsed proﬁles, homepage, and the list
of friends across all four networks.
Second, LinkedIn shows a much lower degree of interaction
among users using messages than Orkut. Only 4% of the
requests in LinkedIn are related to messaging between users.
