### Session End Determination and Sensitivity Analysis
The social network aggregator determines the end of a session in two primary ways:
1. When a user closes the web browser or logs out.
2. When a user does not engage in any action for more than 20 minutes, which is the arbitrarily set threshold.

To assess the sensitivity of this 20-minute session threshold, we examined whether any two consecutive sessions by the same user had an interval shorter than 20 minutes. Our analysis revealed that 22% of all sessions (generated by 13% of all users) ended less than 20 minutes after the previous session, indicating that these sessions were primarily identified by events such as closing the web browser or logging out.

### Session Characteristics
#### Frequency and Duration of OSN Access
To understand how often and for how long people connect to OSN sites, we measured the frequency and duration of sessions for each user. Session duration was calculated as the time interval between the first and last HTTP requests within a session. This method allowed us to infer the duration of any session with at least two HTTP requests. Notably, 87% of all sessions in the dataset contained at least two HTTP requests.

Individuals varied widely in their frequency of accessing social networks. Figure 3(a) shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the total number of sessions per user. The majority of users (63%) accessed the social network aggregator's site only once during the 12-day period, while the most frequent user accessed the site on average 4.1 times a day.

The total time spent on social networks also varied significantly among individuals, as shown in Figure 3(b). For instance, 51% of the users spent no more than 10 minutes at the social network aggregator's site over the 12 days, whereas 14% of the active users spent more than an hour, and the top 2% of users spent more than 12 hours, averaging about an hour a day.

We observed a low correlation (correlation coefficient 0.27) between the frequency and duration of OSN accesses, suggesting that the amount of time a user spends on social networks is not strongly correlated with the specific number of logins. Similarly, there was a weak correlation (correlation coefficient 0.16) between session duration and the number of HTTP requests made during the session. However, this correlation became stronger (correlation coefficient 0.49) for sessions lasting less than 20 minutes, indicating that longer sessions tend to have idle users, while short sessions are more likely to contain more activities.

#### Variation in Session Durations Across OSNs
Session durations varied widely across the four OSN sites, as illustrated in Figure 3(c). All four OSN sites exhibited a consistent heavy-tailed pattern in their session durations. The median session durations differed across the sites: Orkut (13.4 minutes), Hi5 (2.7 minutes), MySpace (24 seconds), and LinkedIn (3 seconds). These differences suggest that users engage in a series of activities when they connect to some sites, while others see more sporadic and brief interactions.

### Concurrent User Analysis
Using the session information, we analyzed the number of concurrent users (i.e., concurrent sessions) accessing any of the four OSN sites, as shown in Figure 2. The horizontal axis marks the beginning of each day, revealing a diurnal pattern with strong peaks around 3 PM (in Brazil). At all times, at least 50 people were using the social network aggregator service, with peak usage exceeding 700 concurrent users, a tenfold increase over the minimum. Weekends showed lower usage compared to weekdays, and the diurnal pattern in OSN workloads aligns with observations from other studies on Facebook and UGC websites.

### Heavy Users' Usage Pattern
Figure 2 also highlights the number of users who stayed online for more than one hour at any given point in time. The daily peaks for heavy users coincided with the overall peaks, and the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient of 0.84 indicated a strong correlation between the total number of online users and the number of heavy users. This suggests that the ratio of heavy users to all users remains relatively constant throughout the day.

### Modeling Orkut Sessions
To understand the dynamics of user arrival and departure processes, we measured session inter-arrival times for Orkut. We used a time series \( t(i) \) to denote the arrival time of the \( i \)-th session and defined \( a(i) \) as \( t(i + 1) - t(i) \), representing the inter-arrival time between the \( i \)-th and \( i + 1 \)-th sessions. Figure 4(a) shows the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of \( a(i) \), which was fitted to a Lognormal distribution with parameters \( \mu = 2.245 \) and \( \sigma = 1.133 \).

The session length, denoted by \( l(i) \), was defined as the number of requests in the \( i \)-th session. Figure 4(b) shows the frequency marginal distribution of \( l(i) \), which follows a Zipf distribution with parameters \( \alpha = 1.765 \) and \( \beta = 4.888 \). This indicates significant variability in the number of actions users make in a single session.

Finally, we characterized the inter-arrival time between requests within a single session, as shown in Figure 4(c). The CCDF distribution was fitted to a Lognormal distribution with parameters \( \mu = 1.789 \) and \( \sigma = 2.366 \). Large inter-arrivals suggest users leaving Orkut pages to spend time on other social networks or features, while small inter-arrivals indicate constant interaction with the site.

### Clickstream Model
In this section, we present a comprehensive view of user behavior in OSNs by characterizing the type, frequency, and sequence of activities users engage in. We developed a new analysis strategy called the clickstream model to identify and describe representative user behaviors based on clickstream data.

#### Step 1: Identifying Dominant User Activities
We manually annotated each log entry with the appropriate activity class (e.g., friend invitation, browsing photos) and grouped semantically similar activities into categories based on the webpage structure of OSN sites.

#### Step 2: Computing Transition Rates Between Activities
We built a first-order Markov chain of user activities to compute the probability transition between every pair of activity states. This provided a holistic view of how users transition from one category of activities to another.

### User Activities in Orkut
In the first step of modeling, we identified 41 activities with at least one HTTP request in the clickstream data. These activities were grouped into the following categories: Search, Scrapbook, Messages, Testimonials, Videos, Photos, Profile & Friends, Communities, and Other. Table 2 displays the list of activities, the number and share of users who engaged in each activity, the number and share of HTTP requests, and the total traffic volume.

#### Activity Categories in Orkut
- **Universal Search**: Allows users to search for profiles, communities, and community topics.
- **Scrapbook**: Displays public text messages sent to a user.
- **Messages**: A private communication feature.
- **Testimonials**: Commentaries left by friends, which can be viewed by anyone.
- **Videos and Photos**: Features for sharing multimedia content.
- **Profile & Friends**: Activities related to managing and visiting profiles.
- **Communities**: Features for creating and participating in communities.

### Comparison of User Activity Across OSNs
We repeated the analysis for other social networks (MySpace, LinkedIn, and Hi5) to compare user behaviors. The most popular activity across all networks was browsing profiles. Some activities, such as Blogs and News pages in MySpace and Jobs and Companies pages in LinkedIn, were unique to specific networks. Table 3 summarizes the top five categories based on the number of HTTP requests for each social network, normalized to 100%.

- **Profile & Friends**: The most popular category across all networks.
- **LinkedIn**: Showed a much lower degree of interaction using messages (only 4% of requests).

This analysis provides valuable insights into the varying patterns of user behavior across different social networks.
