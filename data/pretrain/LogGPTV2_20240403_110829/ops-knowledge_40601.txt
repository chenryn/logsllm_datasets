User: Please provide a solution to ensure that the system can quickly switch to the backup node in a disaster recovery scenario and keep the service continuously available.
Assistant: The following is a possible disaster recovery solution: 1. Realize active-active architecture: Deploy the master node and backup node in different geographical locations, and ensure that the master node and backup node can synchronize data in real time. At the same time, in order to avoid the network delay between the master node and the backup node, a dedicated high-speed network can be used. 2. Realize automatic failover: use a load balancer or other similar technologies to configure the master node and the backup node as a cluster. In the event of a primary node failure, the load balancer will automatically switch traffic to and route requests to the backup node, thereby maintaining continuous availability of the service. 3. Implement application health checks: If the primary node becomes unavailable for some reason, the backup node will become the new primary node. However, if the master node is waiting for consumers to operate due to application problems, the master node will not be able to provide normal service when it becomes available again. Therefore, in a disaster recovery scenario, use application health checks to monitor the actual health status of the primary node to ensure that the system can quickly switch to the backup node in an unavailable state instead of waiting for business operations. 4. Realize real-time data backup: Synchronizing data between the master node and the backup node can not only ensure data consistency, but also ensure system disaster recovery through real-time data backup. After a failure, it should be possible to recover data quickly. Therefore, data needs to be backed up to multiple storage media to ensure backup availability and data security. 5. Realize a comprehensive disaster recovery test: In a disaster recovery scenario, it is necessary to ensure that the backup node can replace the primary node to work normally. Therefore, a comprehensive and standardized disaster recovery test is required to ensure that the backup node has all the necessary functions and configurations. Disaster recovery testing must be performed during working hours to ensure node availability and fault tolerance.
