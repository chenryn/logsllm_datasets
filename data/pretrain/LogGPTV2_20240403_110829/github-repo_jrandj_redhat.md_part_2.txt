1. Processing shell command exit codes
	* The *$?* term expands the exit status of the most recently executed command.
### Operate running systems
1. Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally
    * The RHEL boot process occurs when the system is powered up or reset and lasts until all enabled services are started and a login prompt appears at the screen. The login process consists of 4 steps:
        * The firmware is the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) code that is stored in flash memory on the motherboard. The first thing it does is run the power-on-self-test (POST) to initialise the system hardware components. It also installs appropriate drivers for the video hardware and displays system messages to the screen. It scans the available storage devices to locate a boot device (GRUB2 on RHEL), and then loads it into memory and passes control to it.
        * The boot loader presents a menu with a list of bootable kernels available on the system. After a pre-defined amount of time it boots the default kernel. GRUB2 searches for the kernel in the `/boot` file system. It then extracts the kernel code into memory and loads it based on the configuration in `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`. Note that for UEFI systems, GRUB2 looks in `/boot/efi` instead and loads based on configuration in `/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.efi`. Once the kernel is loaded, GRUB2 passes control to it.
        * The kernel loads the initial RAM disk (initrd) image from the `/boot` file system. This acts as a temporary file system. The kernel then loads necessary modules from initrd to allow access to the physical disks and the partitions and file systems within. It also loads any drivers required to support the boot process. Later, the kernel unmounts initrd and mounts the actual root file system.
        * The kernel continues the boot process. *systemd* is the default system initialisation scheme. It starts all enabled user space system and network services.
    * The *shutdown* command is used to halt, power off, or reboot the system gracefully. This command broadcasts a warning message to all logged-in users, disables further user logins, waits for the specified time, and then stops the service and shuts to the system down to the specified target state. 
    * To shut down the system now:
        ```shell
        shutdown -P now
        ```
    * To halt the system now:
        ```shell
        shutdown -H now
        ```
    * To reboot the system now:
        ```shell
        shutdown -r now
        ```
    * To shut down the system after 5 minutes:
        ```shell
        shutdown -P 5
        ```
1. Boot systems into different targets manually
    * *systemd* is the default system initialisation mechanism in RHEL 8. It is the first process that starts at boot and it is the last process that terminates at shutdown.
    * *Units* are systemd objects that are used for organising boot and maintenance tasks, such as hardware initialisation, socket creation, file system mounts, and service start-ups. Unit configuration is stored in their respective configuration files, which are auto generated from other configurations, created dynamically from the system state, produced at runtime, or user developed. Units are in one of several operational states, including active, inactive, in the process of being activated or deactivated, and failed. Units can be enabled or disabled.
    * Units have a name and a type, which are encoded in files of the form unitname.type. Units can be viewed using the *systemctl* command. A target is a logical collection of units. They are a special systemd unit type with the .target file extension.
    * *systemctl* is the primary command for interaction with systemd. 
    * To boot into a custom target the *e* key can be pressed at the GRUB2 menu, and the desired target specified using systemd.unit. After editing press *ctrl+x* to boot into the target state. To boot into the emergency target: 
        ```shell
        systemd.unit=emergency.target
        ```
    * To boot into the rescue target:
        ```shell
        systemd.unit=rescue.target
        ```
    * Run *systemctl reboot* after you are done to reboot the system.
1. Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system
    * Press *e* at the GRUB2 menu and add "rd.break" in place of "ro crash". This boot option tells the boot sequence to stop while the system is still using initramfs so that we can access the emergency shell.
    * Press *ctrl+x* to reboot.
    * Run the following command to remount the `/sysroot` directory with rw privileges:
        ```shell
        mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
        ```
    *  Run the following command to change the root directory to `/sysroot`:
        ```shell
        chroot /sysroot
        ```
    *  Run *passwd* command to change the root password.
    *  Run the following commands to create an empty, hidden file to instruct the system to perform SELinux relabelling after the next boot:
        ```shell
        touch /.autorelabel
        exit
        exit
        ```
1. Identify CPU/memory intensive processes and kill processes
    * A process is a unit for provisioning system resources. A process is created in memory in its own address space when a program, application, or command is initiated. Processes are organised in a hierarchical fashion. Each process has a parent process that spawns it and may have one or many child processes. Each process is assigned a unique identification number, known as the Process Identifier (PID). When a process completes its lifecycle or is terminated, this event is reported back to its parent process, and all the resources provisioned to it are then freed and the PID is removed. Processes spawned at system boot are called daemons. Many of these sit in memory and wait for an event to trigger a request to use their services.
    * There are 5 basic process states:
        * Running: The process is being executed by the CPU.
        * Sleeping: The process is waiting for input from a user or another process.
        * Waiting: The process has received the input it was waiting for and is now ready to run when its turn arrives.
        * Stopped: The process is halted and will not run even when its turn arrives, unless a signal is sent to change its behaviour.
        * Zombie: The process is dead. Its entry is retained until the parent process permits it to die.
    * The *ps* and *top* commands can be used to view running processes.
    * The *pidof* or *pgrep* commands can be used to view the PID associated with a process name.
    * The *ps* command can be used to view the processes associated with a particular user. An example is shown below:
        ```shell
        ps -U root
        ```
    * To kill a process the *kill* or *pkill* commands can be used. Ordinary users can kill processes they own, while the *root* user can kill any process. The *kill* command requires a PID and the *pkill* command requires a process name. An example is shown below:
        ```shell
        pkill crond
        kill `pidof crond`
        ```
    * The list of signals accessible by *kill* can be seen by passing the *-l* option. The default signal is SIGTERM which signals for a process to terminate in an orderly fashion.
    * To use the SIGKILL signal:
        ```shell
        pkill -9 crond
        kill -9 `pgrep crond`
        ```
    * The *killall* command can be used to terminate all processes that match a specified criterion.
1. Adjust process scheduling
    * The priority of a process ranges from -20 (highest) to +19 (lowest). A higher niceness lowers the execution priority of a process and a lower niceness increases it. A child process inherits the niceness of its parent process.
    * To run a command with a lower (+2) priority:
        ```shell
        nice -2 top
        ```
    * To run a command with a higher (-2) priority:
        ```shell
        nice --2 top
        ```
    * To renice a running process:
        ```shell
        renice 5 1919
        ```
1. Manage tuning profiles
    * Tuned is a service which monitors the system and optimises the performance of the system for different use cases. There are pre-defined tuned profiles available in the `/usr/lib/tuned` directory. New profiles are created in the `/etc/tuned` directory. The *tuned-adm* command allows you to interact with the Tuned service.
    * To install and start the tuned service:
        ```shell
        yum install tuned
        systemctl enable --now tuned
        ```
    * To check the currently active profile:
        ```shell
        tuned-adm active
        ```
    * To check the recommended profile:
        ```shell
        tuned-adm recommend
        ```
    * To change the active profile:
        ```shell
        tuned-adm profile 
        ```
    * To create a customised profile and set it as active:
        ```shell   
        mkdir /etc/tuned/
        vi /etc/tuned//
        # customise as required
        tuned-adm profile 
        systmctl restart tuned.service
        ```
1. Locate and interpret system log files and journals
    * In RHEL logs capture messages generated by the kernel, daemons, commands, user activities, applications, and other events. The daemon that is responsible for system logging is called *rsyslogd*. The configuration file for *rsyslogd* is in the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file. As defined in this configuration file, the default repository for most logs is the `/var/log` directory.
    * The below commands can be used to start and stop the daemon:
        ```shell   
        systemctl stop rsyslog
        systemctl start rsyslog
        ```
    * A script called *logrotate* in `/etc/cron.daily` invokes the *logrotate* command to rotate log files as per the configuration file.
    * The boot log file is available at `/var/log/boot.log` and contains logs generated during system start-up. The system log file is available in `/var/log/messages` and is the default location for storing most system activities.
1. Preserve system journals
    * In addition to system logging, the *journald* daemon (which is an element of *systemd*) also collects and manages log messages from the kernel and daemon processes. It also captures system logs and RAM disk messages, and any alerts generated during the early boot stage. It stores these messages in binary format in files called *journals* in the `/var/run/journal` directory. These files are structured and indexed for faster and easier searches and can be viewed and managed using the *journalctl* command.
    * By default, journals are stored temporarily in the `/run/log/journal` directory. This is a memory-based virtual file system and does not persist across reboots. To have journal files stored persistently in `/var/log/journal` the following commands can be run:
        ```shell   
        mkdir -p /var/log/journal
        systemctl restart systemd-journald
        ```
1. Start, stop, and check the status of network services
    * The *sshd* daemon manages ssh connections to the server. To check the status of this service:
        ```shell   
        systemctl is-active sshd        
        systemctl status sshd
        ```
    * To start and stop this service:
        ```shell   
        systemctl start sshd
        systemctl stop sshd
        ```
    * To enable or disable this service:
        ```shell      
        systemctl enable sshd
        systemctl disable sshd
        ```
    * To completely disable the service (i.e. to avoid loading the service at all):
        ```shell   
        systemctl mask sshd
        systemctl unmask sshd
        ```
1. Securely transfer files between systems
    * To transfer a file using the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP):
        ```shell   
        scp  @:
        ```
    * To transfer a directory:
        ```shell   
        scp /etc/ssh/* @:/tmp
        ```
    * The direction of transfer can also be reversed:
        ```shell   
        scp @:/tmp/sshd_config sshd_config_external
        ```
### Configure local storage
1. List, create, delete partitions on MBR and GPT disks
    * Data is stored on disk drives that are logically divided into partitions. A partition can exist on a portion of a disk, an entire disk, or across multiple disks. Each partition can contain a file system, raw data space, swap space, or dump space.
    * A disk in RHEL can be divided into several partitions. This partition information is stored on the disk in a small region, which is read by the operating system at boot time. This is known as the Master Boot Record (MBR) on BIOS-based systems, and GUID Partition Table (GPT) on UEFI-based systems. At system boot, the BIOS/UEFI scans all storage devices, detects the presence of MBR/GPT, identifies the boot disks, loads the boot loader program in memory from the default boot disk, executes the boot code to read the partition table and identify the `/boot` partition, and continues with the boot process by loading the kernel in the memory and passing control over to it.
    * MBR allows the creation of only up to 4 primary partitions on a single disk, with the option of using one of the 4 partitions as an extended partition to hold an arbitrary number of logical partitions. MBR also lacks addressing space beyond 2TB due to its 32-bit nature and the disk sector size of 512-byte that it uses. MBR is also non-redundant, so a system becomes unbootable if it becomes corrupted somehow.
    * GPT is a newer 64-bit partitioning standard developed and integrated to UEFI firmware. GPT allows for 128 partitions, use of disks much larger than 2TB, and redundant locations for the storage of partition information. GPT also allows a BIOS-based system to boot from a GPT disk, using the boot loader program stored in a protective MBR at the first disk sector.
    * To list the mount points, size, and available space:
        ```shell   
        df -h
        ```
    * In RHEL block devices are an abstraction for certain hardware, such hard disks. The *blkid* command lists all block devices. The *lsblk* command lists more details about block devices.
    * To list all disks and partitions:
        ```shell   
        fdisk -l # MBR
        gdisk -l # GPT
        ```
    * For MBR based partitions the *fdisk* utility can be used to create and delete partitions. To make a change to a disk:
        ```shell   
        fdisk 
        ```
    * For GPT based partitions the *gdisk* utility can be used to create and delete partitions. To make a change to a disk:
        ```shell   
        gdisk 
        ```
    * To inform the OS of partition table changes:
        ```shell   
        partprobe
        ```
1. Create and remove physical volumes
    * Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is used to provide an abstraction layer between the physical storage and the file system. This enables the file system to be resized, to span across multiple physical disks, use random disk space, etc. One or more partitions or disks (physical volumes) can form a logical container (volume group), which is then divided into logical partitions (called logical volumes). These are further divided into physical extents (PEs) and logical extents (LEs).
    * A physical volume (PV) is created when a block storage device is brought under LVM control after going through the initialisation process. This process constructs LVM data structures on the device, including a label on the second sector and metadata information. The label includes a UUID, device size, and pointers to the locations of data and metadata areas.
    * A volume group (VG) is created when at least one physical volume is added to it. The space from all physical volumes in a volume group is aggregated to form one large pool of storage, which is then used to build one or more logical volumes. LVM writes metadata information for the volume group on each physical volume that is added to it.
    * To view physical volumes:
        ```shell   
        pvs
        ```
    * To view physical volumes with additional details:
        ```shell   
        pvdisplay
        ```
    * To initialise a disk or partition for use by LVM:
        ```shell   
        pvcreate 
        ```
    * To remove a physical volume from a disk:
        ```shell   
        pvremove 
        ```
1. Assign physical volumes to volume groups
    * To view volume groups:
        ```shell   
        vgs
        ```
    * To view volume groups with additional details:
        ```shell   
        vgdisplay
        ```
    * To create a volume group:
        ```shell   
        vgcreate  
        ```
    * To extend an existing volume group:
        ```shell   
        vgextend  
        ```
    * To remove a disk from a volume group:
        ```shell   
        vgreduce  
        ```
    * To remove the last disk from a volume group:
        ```shell   
        vgremove  
        ```
1. Create and delete logical volumes
    * To view logical volumes:
        ```shell   
        lvs
        ```
    * To view logical volumes with additional details:
        ```shell   
        lvdisplay
        ```
    * To create a logical volume in vg1 named lv1 and with 4GB of space:
        ```shell   
        lvcreate -L 4G -n lv1 vg1 
        ```
    * To extend the logical volume by 1GB:
        ```shell
