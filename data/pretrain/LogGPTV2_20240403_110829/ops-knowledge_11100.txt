User: I just wrote a small python script that uses BeautifulSoup in order to extract some information from a website.
Everything runs fine whenever the script is run from the command line. However run as a crontab, the server returns me this error: 

Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/home/ws/undwv/mindfactory.py", line 7, in 
      from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  ImportError: No module named bs4

Since I do not have any root access to the server, BeautifulSoup was installed at the user directory: $HOME/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
I suppose the cron tab does not look for modules in the user directory. Any ideas how to solve that?
Assistant: ~/.local paths (populated by pip install --user) are available automatically i.e., it is enough if the cron job belongs to the corresponding user.
To configure arbitrary path, you could use PYTHONPATH envvar in the crontab. Do not corrupt sys.path inside your script.
