Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-link-to-external-
pages-with-anchor-elements has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it,
and include links to screenshots if possible.
When attempting to Run a test, the checklist below the button disappeared, and
will not re-appear when trying to Reset. It does, however, re-appear when
refreshing the browser page.
