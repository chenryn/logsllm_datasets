**ATT&CK ID:** T1557.003  
**Technique Name:** DHCP Spoofing

Adversaries may redirect network traffic to systems they control by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) responses and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the target network. By positioning themselves as an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM), they can intercept and collect network communications, including sensitive information such as credentials, especially when these are transmitted over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This technique also enables further malicious activities, such as network sniffing or data manipulation during transmission.
