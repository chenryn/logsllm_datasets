User:  web application often suffers from SQL injection attacks. How to prevent such attacks?
Assistant: 1. Use parameterized queries: This is one of the most effective ways to prevent SQL injection attacks. Parameterized query can separate the input data from the query statement, reducing the possibility of attackers tampering with the input data. 2. Data filtering: Filter the input data to ensure that only legal characters are included, which can be achieved by using tools such as regular expressions. 3. Data encryption: Sensitive data can be encrypted using an encryption algorithm to ensure that even if the data is leaked, attackers cannot easily obtain sensitive data. 4. Strengthen user authentication: Create an independent account and password for each user, and enforce complex password policies to reduce the possibility of attackers guessing passwords. 5. Update software and patches: Keep software and databases updated and upgraded to ensure that the latest security vulnerabilities are fixed. 6. Firewall: At the network layer, firewall rules are used to block malicious requests and limit data input and output. 7. The principle of least privilege: only authorize relevant users with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the scope of the attack. 8. Audit and log: record all user requests and responses, monitor and alarm abnormal operations, and detect and deal with abnormal situations in time. 9. Security training: popularize security knowledge to everyone, including administrators, developers, and end users, strengthen the security awareness of all employees, and improve the security of the entire system.
