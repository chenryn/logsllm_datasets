To effectively use Git for version control, it is essential to understand and master a series of fundamental commands. Below, I will list and explain three commonly used Git commands, as well as provide additional useful commands for managing your repository.

### Fundamental Git Commands

1. **`git init`**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, allowing you to begin tracking changes and managing versions within that project. This command creates a hidden `.git` subdirectory which contains all necessary repository files (a bare Git repository).

2. **`git add <file>`**: Stages changes (modifications, deletions, or additions) made to specific files in your working directory, preparing them to be included in the next commit. To stage all changed files at once, you can use `git add .`. The staged changes are moved from the working directory to the staging area (also known as the index), ready to be committed.

3. **`git commit -m "Commit message"`**: Creates a new snapshot of the current state of the project, including all changes that have been staged via `git add`, and adds this snapshot to the project history. Itâ€™s important to provide a clear and concise commit message describing what was changed and why.

### Additional Useful Git Commands

- **`git status`**: Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which files have been modified, which ones are not being tracked by Git, and which changes have been staged for the next commit.

- **`git log`**: Shows a detailed commit history, listing each commit along with its author, date, and commit message. You can also view more information about individual commits using options like `--stat` or `--patch`.

- **`git branch`**: Lists, creates, renames, or deletes branches. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with changes in isolation from the main codebase. For example, `git branch feature-x` creates a new branch named `feature-x`.

- **`git merge <branch>`**: Combines the changes from one branch into another. This is often used to integrate a feature branch back into the main branch after development is complete. Conflicts may arise if the same part of the code has been modified in both branches; these need to be resolved manually.

- **`git clone <repository-url>`**: Copies an existing Git repository from a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to your local machine. This command creates a local copy of the repository, including all branches and history.

- **`git pull`**: Fetches updates from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch. This is a convenient way to keep your local repository up-to-date with the latest changes from the remote.

- **`git push <remote> <branch>`**: Pushes your local commits to a remote repository, making them available to others. For example, `git push origin main` pushes the `main` branch to the `origin` remote repository.

By mastering these commands, you can efficiently manage your projects and collaborate with others using Git for version control.
