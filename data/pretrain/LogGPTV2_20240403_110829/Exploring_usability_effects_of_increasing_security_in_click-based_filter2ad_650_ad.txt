For example, the 5 click-point line represents all passwords
containing 5 click-points regardless of whether they were cre-
ated on small or large images. The point coordinates on the
large images are re-scaled to the coordinate system of the
small image so that all data is presented at 451× 331 dimen-
sions. This aligns features on the small and large versions of
the same images. The lines on the graph do not show any
consistent relationship between each other.
To our knowledge, there is no statistical test to compare
sets of J-statistics to each other. If we regard the data as
categorical, we can identify six categories stemming from
the possible orderings: 5-6-7, 5-7-6, 6-5-7, 6-7-5, 7-5-6, 7-6-
5. For example, in Figure 5 the alphamat image falls in the
5-7-6 category because J(9) for 5 click-points is larger than
J(9) for 7 click-points, which is larger than J(9) for 6 click-
points. We can then apply a chi-squared test between the
observed results and the expected results (equal probability
for each category). This test shows no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
(χ2(5, n = 60) = 5.675, p = 0.339). We therefore ﬁnd no
evidence for a diﬀerence in clustering between the diﬀerent
numbers of click-points.
Figure 6 shows the level of clustering for the 30 images,
distinguishing the eﬀects of image size. Each line contains
the statistics for passwords created on either the small or
large images. For each of the two cases, data from 5, 6, and 7
click-points are combined. In other words, all passwords cre-
ated on large images (regardless of how many click-points)
are grouped together, and all passwords created on small
images (regardless of how many click-points) form a second
group. The data from the large images are again scaled to
ensure comparability of the J-statistic.
For most images, the graph indicates that the larger im-
ages have less clustering (J(9) closer to 1) than the smaller
images. If we regard the data as categorical, we could dis-
tinguish two categories representing whether the small or
large image size has stronger clustering. We applied a chi-
squared test between the observed results and the expected
results (equal probability for each category). This test shows
85
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in clustering for the small and large
images (χ2(1, n = 60) = 9.603, p = 0.002), indicating that
larger images have signiﬁcantly less clustering.
In summary, from Figure 5 it appears that additional
click-points do not lead to user behaviour resulting in more
clustering. However, larger images appear to inﬂuence user
choice towards less clustering. This is probably due to the
relatively smaller size of the viewport on the larger images.
This result suggests that PCCP’s shuﬄe mechanism and
viewport (if kept at the same size) is more eﬀective in reduc-
ing clustering, and therefore promoting security, when used
with larger images.
6. DISCUSSION
We did not see large diﬀerences in how the number of
click-points and image size aﬀected usability. We expected
that increasing the image size would have little or no eﬀect
on usability and memorability but we found that it had a
similar eﬀect to increasing the number of click-points.
This presents an opportunity, suggesting that other con-
siderations can be taken into account when increasing se-
curity. In a situation where choosing a click-point is com-
paratively diﬃcult (as for a person with a poor ﬁne motor
control), this might be accommodated by having fewer click-
points, but larger images. More click-points might be appro-
priate in a situation where screen size was limited, such as on
a mobile device. The equivalent demands on usability when
increasing security thus give increased ﬂexibility in design.
The conditions under which participants created and used
their passwords are clearly artiﬁcial.
In real life, it is ex-
tremely unlikely that a user would create six passwords in a
row, then not see them again for two weeks, until they tried
to log into all six accounts. The design of our study was
meant to emphasize diﬀerences between the six conditions
by making the task harder. The results of the study for
the create, conﬁrm, and login phases are similar to results
seen in an earlier study of PCCP [6] and are consistently
good, with only small diﬀerences between conditions. Fur-
ther work is needed to conﬁrm real-life usability. We have
developed a web-based infrastructure that will allow us to
conduct such tests in the near future.

Multiple passwords are an important issue in authenti-
cation. Users typically have many diﬀerent accounts and
are asked to remember many diﬀerent passwords [17]. This
places an increased memory burden on users, and can lead
to security and usability problems such as forgetting pass-
words, and confusing passwords across accounts [18]. Re-
86
membering a password for one account can disrupt the mem-
ory of a password for another account. This psychologi-
cal phenomenon is known as interference [1]. In our study,
participants each created six passwords, each of which was
only tenuously linked to a user account. These accounts
(library, email, bank, blog, online dating, instant messen-
ger, and work) were denoted only by coloured banners on
the login screen (see Figure 1). Although we attempted to
emphasize to the user that each account was distinct, there
was no practical diﬀerence between them. In real life, ac-
counts would be separated from each other by appearance
of the website, or created at diﬀerent times. Participants
likely had a hard time distinguishing their passwords from
each other, and this interference might have led to more
diﬃculty in remembering them after two weeks.
Although our study focused on several speciﬁc conﬁgu-
rations of PCCP, it is important to consider the general
underlying principles involved.
Image Size: The size of the images shown in each pass-
word seems to relate to several human factors. The user
likely responds to the appearance of the image with a quick
visual survey of the image. While principles of visual at-
tention apply to this survey, the nature of the survey may
change with familiarity, or even with exposure to other im-
ages or events that relate to the image. The human vi-
sual system involves several approaches, including taking in
the overall impression, and responding to various attractors.
Our initial speculation was that these might be the domi-
nant factors, and we did not expect them to vary much with
image size.
◦
For closer inspection of an image, however, the eye will
be directed to speciﬁc parts of the image. Such close vi-
sual inspection requires high acuity vision using the fovea,
the area of the retina with a high density of photoreceptor
cells [16]. The size of the fovea limits foveal vision to an an-
within the direct line to the target
gle of approximately 1
of interest. At a normal viewing distance for a computer
screen, say 60cm, this results in sharp vision over an area of
approximately 4cm2. The size of the image, and the number
of attractors, will then determine the number of foveal areas
the user will inspect, and the distance of the saccades as
they move from one target to another will also be a factor.
Several factors will aﬀect how PCCP users survey an im-
age. PCCP is a cued-recall scheme, so users will be looking
for cues to remind them where to click. PCCP also gives im-
plicit feedback with each image about the previous click, by
displaying the correct image if user choose the correct click-
point. This means that the user will be assessing whether or
not the current image is familiar to them. Then, once users
have recognized the image and found their click-point, they
must position the cursor correctly using a mouse, touchpad
or other pointing device. The time taken to position the
cursor may be predicted by Fitts’ Law, which determines
targeting time from the distance and target size [22]. How-
ever, we typically observe users moving the cursor to follow
their gaze as they examine the image, so the ﬁnal movement
to a click-point is typically very short.
Click-points: The number of click-points in a PCCP
password requires a repetition of all the elements involved in
ﬁnding and clicking on a single point. We initially assumed
this repetition would make the number of click-points a more
important factor than the size of the image in determining
the usability, but the study results did not support this. In
a pure-recall system, we would expect to see serial memory
eﬀects, which cause people to better remember the items
at the beginning and end of an ordered list. With PCCP’s
cued-recall, however, we expect milder serial memory eﬀects,
because participants respond to each picture as an individ-
ual cue. However, it is certainly possible that users begin
to learn the pattern of click-points and anticipate where to
focus their gaze, and move their cursor. This anticipation
may reduce the work needed per image in ways that have
not yet been fully explored.

Alternative Conﬁgurations:
It appears that factors
such as increasing the number of click-points or image size
balance each other out, at least for the settings in our study.
To consider the general underlying principles, we might spec-
ulate about more extreme possibilities. In our study, the two
image sizes used were 451 × 331 pixels and 800 × 600 pix-
els. The tolerance region of the scheme was 19 × 19 pixels,
which meant that the images had approximately 414 and
1330 click areas distinguishable to the system, respectively.
Our LCD display measured 43cm (17in) diagonally with a
resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels. The small image measured
about 12cm × 9cm, or 84cm2, and the large image about
21cm × 16cm or 336cm2. Our study showed that users can
cope with inspecting and selecting click-points on images of
both sizes within a reasonable amount of time: mean lo-
gin times were approximately 20 seconds, including entry of
username and all click-points.
In our S6 and L5 conditions, the theoretical password
space is approximately 52 bits. In S7 and L6, it is about
62 bits. Knowing that the image sizes in these conditions
were usable, we explore larger sizes in order to decrease the
number of click-points while keeping the password space the
same. Table 8 shows some possibilities. For example, even
requiring only 3 clicks and keeping the aspect ratio the same
would require an image size of 8916× 6687 pixels for 52 bits,
and 28305×21229 pixels for 62 bits. These would seem to be
unreasonable sizes for graphical password images, and would
involve a very large number of areas to be inspected. As the
number of click-point required decreases, the size of the im-
ages implied must grow exponentially, and quickly reaches
the bounds of usability. We do navigate on very large virtual
displays when using cartographic browsers such as Google
Earth. This is only manageable, however, through the use
of the zoom and pan capabilities, and so the interaction in
fact involves a number of clicks.
87
Implications for Mobile Devices: Our participants
managed well with passwords of 5, 6, and 7 click-points in
length, so an alternative exploration might be to consider
more click points, and allow the image size to be reduced
while still maintaining a large password space. Table 9 shows
possibilities, using typical small sizes on mobile devices. For
example, a small mobile phone might have 120 × 80 pixels,
whereas a Blackberry Curve 8300 has 320× 240 pixels, while
the Blackberry Bold and the Apple iPhone have 480 × 320
pixels. Mobile devices sometimes involve a touchscreen in-
stead of a stylus, and often use a dense pixel pitch so images
appear physically smaller than the equivalent dimensions on
a computer screen. In the table, we accommodate this by
using a tolerance region for the mobile devices of 38 × 38:
the size of square onscreen keyboard elements on an iPhone.
For the iPhone screen, this would require 8 clicks for a 52
bit password space. These numbers seem potentially accept-
able, especially as we frequently type words of that many
characters. This suggests that a graphical password scheme
such as PCCP might be usable on mobile devices. The small
screens will not be compatible with the current viewport be-
cause its current size highlights too much of the image to
eﬀectively reduce clustering. We are currently exploring a
redesigned viewport mechanism. The increasing use of mo-
bile devices for secure online transactions indicates a need
for more secure passwords than simple screen unlock mecha-
nisms, and we believe a system such as PCCP has potential
for both usability and security.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explored the issue of how increasing the
security of a click-based graphical password scheme would
aﬀect usability and memorability. We tested PCCP with
diﬀerent parameters in order to evaluate its usability when
the theoretical password space is increased. We found that
increasing the number of click-points or increasing the image
size both have usability and memorability impacts. While
varying parameters to hold constant the size of the theoret-
ical password space, we found no evidence of diﬀerences be-
tween conﬁgurations varying the number of click-points and
image size. Additionally, we explored the eﬀects of number
of click-points and image size on user behaviour resulting in
clustering of click-points. We found no evidence that the
number of click-points had an eﬀect, but it appeared that
larger images led to less clustering.
These results have important implications for practical
conﬁguration of graphical password schemes in various con-
texts. For example, the results suggest that for mobile de-
vices with small screens, it might be possible to increase se-
curity by using smaller images and more click-points while
retaining usability and memorability. Conversely, larger im-
ages appear to lead to less clustering, suggesting an issue
that should be considered in future research.
