#### Password Clustering Analysis

For example, the 5-click-point line represents all passwords containing 5 click-points, regardless of whether they were created on small or large images. The point coordinates on the large images are re-scaled to match the coordinate system of the small image, ensuring that all data is presented at 451×331 dimensions. This alignment facilitates a consistent comparison of features between the small and large versions of the same images. The lines on the graph do not exhibit any consistent relationship with each other.

To our knowledge, there is no established statistical test to compare sets of J-statistics. If we treat the data as categorical, we can identify six categories based on the possible orderings: 5-6-7, 5-7-6, 6-5-7, 6-7-5, 7-5-6, and 7-6-5. For instance, in Figure 5, the alphamat image falls into the 5-7-6 category because J(9) for 5 click-points is larger than J(9) for 7 click-points, which in turn is larger than J(9) for 6 click-points. We can then apply a chi-squared test to compare the observed results with the expected results (assuming equal probability for each category). This test shows no significant differences (χ²(5, n = 60) = 5.675, p = 0.339). Therefore, we find no evidence of a difference in clustering between different numbers of click-points.

Figure 6 illustrates the level of clustering for the 30 images, distinguishing the effects of image size. Each line represents the statistics for passwords created on either the small or large images. For each case, data from 5, 6, and 7 click-points are combined. In other words, all passwords created on large images (regardless of the number of click-points) are grouped together, and all passwords created on small images form a second group. The data from the large images are again scaled to ensure comparability of the J-statistic.

For most images, the graph indicates that larger images have less clustering (J(9) closer to 1) than smaller images. If we treat the data as categorical, we can distinguish two categories: one for stronger clustering in small images and another for weaker clustering in large images. A chi-squared test between the observed and expected results (assuming equal probability for each category) shows a significant difference in clustering for the small and large images (χ²(1, n = 60) = 9.603, p = 0.002), indicating that larger images have significantly less clustering.

In summary, Figure 5 suggests that additional click-points do not lead to user behavior resulting in more clustering. However, larger images appear to influence user choice towards less clustering. This is likely due to the relatively smaller size of the viewport on the larger images. This result implies that PCCP’s shuffle mechanism and viewport (if kept at the same size) are more effective in reducing clustering and thus promoting security when used with larger images.

#### Discussion

We did not observe significant differences in how the number of click-points and image size affected usability. We expected that increasing the image size would have little or no effect on usability and memorability, but found that it had a similar effect to increasing the number of click-points. This presents an opportunity, suggesting that other considerations can be taken into account when increasing security. For example, if choosing a click-point is comparatively difficult (e.g., for a person with poor fine motor control), this might be accommodated by using fewer click-points but larger images. Conversely, more click-points might be appropriate in situations where screen size is limited, such as on mobile devices. The equivalent demands on usability when increasing security thus provide increased flexibility in design.

The conditions under which participants created and used their passwords in our study were clearly artificial. In real life, it is extremely unlikely that a user would create six passwords in a row, then not see them again for two weeks, until they tried to log into all six accounts. The design of our study was intended to emphasize differences between the six conditions by making the task harder. The results of the study for the create, confirm, and login phases are similar to those seen in an earlier study of PCCP [6] and are consistently good, with only small differences between conditions. Further work is needed to confirm real-life usability. We have developed a web-based infrastructure that will allow us to conduct such tests in the near future.

#### Image Size and Human Factors

The size of the images in each password seems to relate to several human factors. Users likely respond to the appearance of the image with a quick visual survey. While principles of visual attention apply to this survey, the nature of the survey may change with familiarity or exposure to other images or events related to the image. The human visual system involves several approaches, including taking in the overall impression and responding to various attractors. Our initial speculation was that these might be the dominant factors, and we did not expect them to vary much with image size.

For closer inspection of an image, the eye will be directed to specific parts of the image. Such close visual inspection requires high acuity vision using the fovea, the area of the retina with a high density of photoreceptor cells [16]. The size of the fovea limits foveal vision to an angle of approximately 1° within the direct line to the target of interest. At a normal viewing distance for a computer screen (e.g., 60 cm), this results in sharp vision over an area of approximately 4 cm². The size of the image and the number of attractors will determine the number of foveal areas the user will inspect, and the distance of the saccades as they move from one target to another will also be a factor.

Several factors affect how PCCP users survey an image. PCCP is a cued-recall scheme, so users will be looking for cues to remind them where to click. PCCP also provides implicit feedback with each image about the previous click, displaying the correct image if the user chooses the correct click-point. This means that the user will be assessing whether the current image is familiar. Once users have recognized the image and found their click-point, they must position the cursor correctly using a mouse, touchpad, or other pointing device. The time taken to position the cursor may be predicted by Fitts’ Law, which determines targeting time from the distance and target size [22]. However, we typically observe users moving the cursor to follow their gaze as they examine the image, so the final movement to a click-point is usually very short.

#### Click-Points and User Behavior

The number of click-points in a PCCP password requires a repetition of all the elements involved in finding and clicking on a single point. We initially assumed that this repetition would make the number of click-points a more important factor than the size of the image in determining usability, but the study results did not support this. In a pure-recall system, we would expect to see serial memory effects, which cause people to better remember the items at the beginning and end of an ordered list. With PCCP’s cued-recall, however, we expect milder serial memory effects because participants respond to each picture as an individual cue. However, it is certainly possible that users begin to learn the pattern of click-points and anticipate where to focus their gaze and move their cursor. This anticipation may reduce the work needed per image in ways that have not yet been fully explored.

#### Alternative Configurations

It appears that factors such as increasing the number of click-points or image size balance each other out, at least for the settings in our study. To consider the general underlying principles, we might speculate about more extreme possibilities. In our study, the two image sizes used were 451 × 331 pixels and 800 × 600 pixels. The tolerance region of the scheme was 19 × 19 pixels, which meant that the images had approximately 414 and 1330 click areas distinguishable to the system, respectively. Our LCD display measured 43 cm (17 in) diagonally with a resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels. The small image measured about 12 cm × 9 cm, or 84 cm², and the large image about 21 cm × 16 cm or 336 cm². Our study showed that users can cope with inspecting and selecting click-points on images of both sizes within a reasonable amount of time: mean login times were approximately 20 seconds, including entry of username and all click-points.

In our S6 and L5 conditions, the theoretical password space is approximately 52 bits. In S7 and L6, it is about 62 bits. Knowing that the image sizes in these conditions were usable, we explore larger sizes to decrease the number of click-points while keeping the password space the same. Table 8 shows some possibilities. For example, even requiring only 3 clicks and keeping the aspect ratio the same would require an image size of 8916 × 6687 pixels for 52 bits and 28305 × 21229 pixels for 62 bits. These would seem to be unreasonable sizes for graphical password images and would involve a very large number of areas to be inspected. As the number of required click-points decreases, the size of the images implied must grow exponentially, quickly reaching the bounds of usability. We do navigate on very large virtual displays when using cartographic browsers such as Google Earth, but this is only manageable through the use of zoom and pan capabilities, involving multiple clicks.

#### Implications for Mobile Devices

Our participants managed well with passwords of 5, 6, and 7 click-points in length, so an alternative exploration might be to consider more click points and allow the image size to be reduced while still maintaining a large password space. Table 9 shows possibilities using typical small sizes on mobile devices. For example, a small mobile phone might have 120 × 80 pixels, whereas a Blackberry Curve 8300 has 320 × 240 pixels, and the Blackberry Bold and the Apple iPhone have 480 × 320 pixels. Mobile devices sometimes involve a touchscreen instead of a stylus and often use a dense pixel pitch, so images appear physically smaller than the equivalent dimensions on a computer screen. In the table, we accommodate this by using a tolerance region for the mobile devices of 38 × 38: the size of square onscreen keyboard elements on an iPhone. For the iPhone screen, this would require 8 clicks for a 52-bit password space. These numbers seem potentially acceptable, especially as we frequently type words of that many characters. This suggests that a graphical password scheme such as PCCP might be usable on mobile devices. The small screens will not be compatible with the current viewport because its current size highlights too much of the image to effectively reduce clustering. We are currently exploring a redesigned viewport mechanism. The increasing use of mobile devices for secure online transactions indicates a need for more secure passwords than simple screen unlock mechanisms, and we believe a system such as PCCP has potential for both usability and security.

#### Conclusion

In this paper, we explored the issue of how increasing the security of a click-based graphical password scheme would affect usability and memorability. We tested PCCP with different parameters to evaluate its usability when the theoretical password space is increased. We found that increasing the number of click-points or increasing the image size both have usability and memorability impacts. While varying parameters to hold constant the size of the theoretical password space, we found no evidence of differences between configurations varying the number of click-points and image size. Additionally, we explored the effects of the number of click-points and image size on user behavior resulting in clustering of click-points. We found no evidence that the number of click-points had an effect, but it appeared that larger images led to less clustering.

These results have important implications for practical configuration of graphical password schemes in various contexts. For example, the results suggest that for mobile devices with small screens, it might be possible to increase security by using smaller images and more click-points while retaining usability and memorability. Conversely, larger images appear to lead to less clustering, suggesting an issue that should be considered in future research.
