Assistant: Following are the steps and configuration parameters to install and configure Nginx reverse proxy server on Linux server. 1. Install Nginx You can use the following command to install Nginx on a Linux server: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx ``` 2.

Test the configuration Reload the Nginx configuration file and test the configuration: ``` sudo service nginx restart sudo nginx -t ``` If there is no error prompt, the configuration is successful. 4.
