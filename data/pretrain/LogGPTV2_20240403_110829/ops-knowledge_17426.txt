User: I've set up a very simple python eve on a linux machine. Somehow, it always stops responding after running for a while. I don't have much experience on python programming and eve doesn't seem to have very nice log file.
Can someone please help me to look into the root cause?
Thanks,
Chunan

>python yourPeve.py
You need to run:
>python yourPeve.py &
The & simbol, will put the process in the background, so, when you close the terminal, the process won't be killed.
