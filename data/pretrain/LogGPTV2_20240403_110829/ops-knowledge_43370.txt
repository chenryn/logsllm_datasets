User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache 2.4: First VirtualHost configuration loading for ServerNames of other vhosts I have a problem with VirtualHosts which Apache 2.4. 

If I navigate to ty1.dev, I get the site for af2.dev instead

If this was Apache 2.2, all I would need to add is NameVirtualHost *:80 but is ignored in 2.4.

error.log does not report any problems

What have I missed?

# httpd-vhosts.conf
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName af2.dev
    ServerAlias af2.dev
    ServerAdmin user@host.dev
    DocumentRoot "c:/Users/Adam.Adam-PC/Sites/af2/web"
    &lt;Directory c:/Users/Adam.Adam-PC/Sites/af2/web&gt;
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName ty1.dev
    ServerAlias ty1.dev
    ServerAdmin user@host.dev
    DocumentRoot "c:/Users/Adam.Adam-PC/Sites/ty1"
    &lt;Directory c:/Users/Adam.Adam-PC/Sites/ty1&gt;
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

Assistant: try putting a specific ip and port in your listen statement as well as your virtualhost blocks. So put:

listen 127.0.0.1:80


and in each of your virtualhost:

&lt;virtualhost 127.0.0.1:80&gt;
