We evaluated the robustness of three object detectors across 15 safety properties. For comparison, we also included ResNet-152, a well-known image classifier. The results are summarized in Figure 6. As expected, the object detectors generally exhibited greater robustness than the image classifier across various safety properties. In the best case, YOLOv3 required 6.4 times more perturbations to be fooled by "Additive Uniform Noise" compared to ResNet-152, which is one of the most robust pre-trained image classifiers.

Figure 4 illustrates the fooling success rate and the mean L2 distance for each property. We observed that for the "Brightness" property, RetinaResnet had a higher fooling rate than other models. 

The model robustness rankings for selected safety properties from each category (ImageNet dataset) are shown in Figure 2. The y-axis represents the minimal perturbation in L2 distance. Table II provides a detailed comparison of the robustness of 13 pre-trained ImageNet models with an input size of 224Ã—224, measured by the minimal perturbation in L2 distance. The table includes categories such as Luminance (L.), Blur (B.), Corruption Noise (C.), Transformation (T.), and Weather (W.). For each safety property, the model with the highest robustness is highlighted. The "Param" column indicates the model size.
