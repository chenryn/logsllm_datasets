# Introduction to the Wiimote: Nintendoâ€™s Controller for the Wii System

## Presenters:
- Rob Rehrig
- Josh Marks
- Larry Aiello

### Overview of the Wiimote
- **Infrared Camera in the Front**: The Wiimote is equipped with an infrared camera that detects and tracks the movement and position of the controller.
- **Direction and Distance Detection**: The camera determines the direction in which the Wiimote is moving and its distance from the Sensor Bar.
- **Sensor Bar**: The Sensor Bar consists of two clusters of IR LEDs. The Wiimote uses the coordinates of these clusters to determine its positioning.
- **Multiple IR Sources**: The Wiimote can track up to four IR sources simultaneously.

## Why We Chose the Wii Platform
- **Cost-Effective**: Wiimotes are relatively inexpensive, typically costing around $40.
- **Advanced Infrared Tracking**: The Wiimote offers excellent infrared tracking capabilities, allowing it to track up to four sources.
- **Bluetooth Capabilities**: The Wiimote can easily relay information to a computer via Bluetooth.
- **Existing Libraries**: There are existing libraries, such as wiiuse.net, that facilitate access to Wiimote data.

## Our Plan
Our goal is to provide more interface options for people with disabilities by leveraging the Wiimote's features:
- **Infrared Tracking**
  - **Head-to-Mouse Tracking**: Using head movements to control the mouse.
  - **Gesture Recognition**: Simplifying user interfaces through gesture-based controls.
  - **Weight Shift Tracking**: Utilizing the Wii Balance Board for additional mouse control.
- **Mouse Simulation**: Enhancing accessibility through various tracking methods.

### Helping the Disabled
- **Head Tracking for Mouse Control**: By attaching an infrared source to the head, users can control the mouse through head movements. The Wiimote tracks the IR source and relays the coordinates to create mouse positioning.
  - **3D Positioning**: X and Y coordinates for mouse movement, and Z coordinate to determine the distance from the screen.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Reducing the complexity of user interfaces by recognizing gestures.
- **Wii Balance Board for Added Mouse Control**: Using the 16-bit pressure sensors in the Wii Balance Board (one on each corner, totaling four) to calibrate initial pressure and return pressure displacements for additional mouse control.

## Long-Term Goals and Possibilities
- **Sign Language Recognition**: Expanding the use of the Wiimote to recognize sign language.
- **Enhanced User Interface Capabilities**: Developing more advanced and intuitive user interface controls.
- **Simpler Design**: Creating a more streamlined design with fewer wires and reduced power consumption.

Thank you for your attention! We hope you found this presentation informative and inspiring. 

**Wii love you all!**
