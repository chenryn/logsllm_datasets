Introduction to the Wiimote
 Nintendo’s controller for the Wii system
 Infrared camera in the front
 Determines direction Wiimote is moving
 How far the Wiimote is from the Sensor Bar
 Sensor Bar is just 2 clusters of IR LEDs
 Wiimote cluster coordinates to determine positioning
 Track up to 4 IR sources
Why We Chose the Wii 
Platform
 Wiimotes are inexpensive ($40)
 Great infrared tracking capabilities
 Up to 4 sources
 Bluetooth capabilities
 Easy to relay information to computer
 Existing libraries that access wiimote data

Our Plan
 Provide more interface options for people with 
disabilities
 Infrared Tracking
 Head to mouse tracking
 Gesture recognition
 Weight shift tracking
 Mouse simulation
Help the Disabled
 Head tracking to provide alternate mouse control
 Gesture recognition to reduce interface complexity
 Wii Balance Board for added mouse control
Infrared Tracking – Head 
Tracking
 Attach an infrared source to the head
 Enables head movement to mouse positioning
 Wiimote tracks IR positioning on head
 Relays the coordinates to create mouse positioning
 3 Dimensional positioning
 X and Y coordinates for mouse movement
 Z coordinate to determine distance from the screen
Wii Balance Board 
Tracking
 16 bit Pressure sensors in the feet
 1 on each corner (4 total)
 Calibrate initial pressure
 Returns pressure displacements
Long Term 
Goals/Possibilities
 Sign language recognition
 More user interface capabilities and controls
 A simpler design (less wires and power used)
Wii love you all!
