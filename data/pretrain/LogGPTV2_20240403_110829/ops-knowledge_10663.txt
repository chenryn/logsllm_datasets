User: How to configure the container orchestration tool Kubernetes?
Assistant: The following are the configuration steps of the container orchestration tool Kubernetes: 1. Install Docker: Before using Kubernetes, you must first install Docker, because Kubernetes runs containers based on Docker. You can download the installation package or image suitable for your system from the Docker official website. 2. Install Kubernetes: You can download the provided binary installation file from the Kubernetes official website, or use the Kubectl tool to install. 3. Configure Kubernetes Master: The master node is the management center of the entire system, including API Server, Controller Manager and Scheduler. These components can be started by executing the commands kubelet, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler. 4. Configure Kubernetes Nodes: This node is where the container actually runs, and the configuration of the node is completed by executing the commands kubelet, kube-proxy and kube-proxy. 5. Create a Kubernetes cluster: Add the machine running the Kubernetes node to the cluster by using the command kubeadm join. 6. Configure the Kubernetes template: When running the container, you need to define various attributes of the container, such as required resource configuration, container components, port mapping, etc. These attributes can be completed by configuring the Kubernetes template. After the configuration is complete, the Kubectl tool can be used to verify the status and operation of the Kubernetes system.
