### Bug report
**Bug summary**
When trying to show a figure under the `TkAgg` backend, my system crashes when
calling `plt.show()` (some quick googling led me to a seemingly similar issue
#10833).
**Code for reproduction**
I use the following script:
    import sys
    print("Python", sys.version)
    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use("TkAgg") # use interactive Agg backend
    print("Matplotlib", matplotlib.__version__, "(backend: " + matplotlib.get_backend() + ')')
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot([0], [0])
    plt.show()
**Actual outcome**
When running this, my system crashes and immediately prompts the log-in
screen. When logging back in, all the programs that were running restart, as
if the system completely restarted.
**Expected outcome**
When leaving out the line specifying to use the `TkAgg` backend, the code
shows the empty plot as expected, as well as the output:
    Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 16:54:48) 
    [Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)]
    Matplotlib 3.1.0 (backend: MacOSX)
Alternatively, leaving out the `plt.show()` command means the code does not
cause any trouble, either.
**Matplotlib version**
  * Operating system: Mac OSX 10.14.6
  * Matplotlib version: 3.1.0
  * Matplotlib backend: MacOSX/TkAgg
  * Python version: 3.7.4
I installed the latest version of the conda distribution and run this in the
base environment.
