ABSTRACT
The impressive growth of the mobile Internet has motivated several
industry reports retelling the story in terms of number of devices
or subscriptions sold per regions, or the increase in mobile traffic,
both WiFi and cellular. Yet, despite the abundance of such reports,
we still lack an understanding of the impact of cellular networks
around the world.
We present the first comprehensive analysis of global cellular
networks. We describe an approach to accurately identify cellu-
lar network IP addresses using the Network Information API, a
non-standard Javascript API in several mobile browsers, and show
its effectiveness in a range cellular network configurations. We
combine this approach with the vantage point of one of the world’s
largest CDNs, with servers located in 1,450 networks and clients dis-
tributed across across 245 countries, to characterize cellular access
around the globe.
We find that the majority of cellular networks exist as mixed
networks (i.e., networks that share both fixed-line and cellular de-
vices), requiring prefix – not ASN – level identification. We discover
over 350 thousand /24 and 23 thousand /48 cellular IPv4 and IPv6
prefixes respectively. By utilizing addresses level traffic from the
same CDN, we calculate the fraction of traffic coming from cellular
addresses. Overall we find that cellular traffic comprises 16.2% of
the CDN’s global traffic, and that cellular traffic ranges widely in
importance between countries, from capturing nearly 96% of all
traffic in Ghana to just 12.1% in France.

1 INTRODUCTION
The tremendous growth of the mobile Internet, with over 11 billion
devices connected by 2020 [8], and its economic implications have
motivated several reports retelling the story in terms of number
of devices sold, 3G/4G subscriptions per regions or the increase
in mobile traffic (both WiFi and cellular) based on survey-based
estimations [5, 6, 10, 18]. And yet, despite the abundance of these
reports, we lack an understanding of the impact of cellular networks
around the world.
There are a number of reasons for this. For one, it is currently
challenging to tell whether a particular IP address comes from a
cellular or fixed-line user. In much of the world, cellular users reside
in networks that combine both cellular and fixed-line customers,
complicating any straightforward attempt at identification. Know-
ing a device type (e.g., smartphone or tablet) has limited value as
most mobile devices have multiple interfaces and users tend to
offload cellular traffic to WiFi when available. And while instru-
mented devices or data collected from a network operator’s core
could provide detailed information on cell network usage, scaling
this sort of studies have proven to be difficult [24, 27].
A comprehensive understanding of cellular access has a wide
range of applications for different stakeholders in the Internet. For
content providers and delivery networks, identifying access tech-
nology would help diagnosing and addressing performance issues
in the wild. Researchers and operators could better understand how
networks are being used around the world and identify potential
trends, while policy makers could have a firmer statistical footing
for investment decisions.
In this paper we tackle a straightforward yet challenging prob-
lem: “Can we estimate the relative importance of cellular networks
around the world?” We make two key contributions. First, we de-
scribe an approach to accurately identify cellular network addresses
using client browser signals and show its effectiveness in a range
of mixed networks (i.e., networks which share both fixed line and
cellular devices). Using this approach, we leverage the global van-
tage point of one of the world’s largest CDNs to map global cellular
IP space and its housing ASes. Our second main contribution is a
first-of-its-kind study characterizing cellular network configuration
and usage around the world.
A summary of our key findings includes:
• We identify 350 thousand cellular /24 IPv4 subnets, and 23
thousand /48 IPv6 subnets worldwide, and that these com-
prise 7.3% and 1.2% of active IP address space respectively.
• We identify 668 cellular ASes, and show that a majority
(58.6%) of cellular access networks are “mixed networks”,
housing both cellular and fixed-line broadband customers in
the same AS.

network usage and behavior.
• We find a high concentration of traffic in a very small fraction
of cellular subnets. In a large European operator, 24 out of
514 – thats 4.6% – active cellular /24s account for 99.5% of
cellular demand.
• We find that cellular traffic represents 16.2% of all global
traffic in December 2016. We show that the fraction of traffic
traversing cellular links varies widely across countries and
continents. For example, while only 16.6% of U.S. traffic is
cellular, cellular composes 63% of all traffic in Indonesia and
95.9% of all traffic in Ghana.
• We find that with a few exceptions – namely the U.S. and
India – that IPv6 is not widely deployed across global cellular
networks. We found only 1.2% of all active IPv6 /48 subnets
are cellular, and are found in only 52 of the 668 (7.7%) cellular
ASes.
In the following section we expand on our motivation and de-
scribe current approaches for studying and characterizing mobile
Internet trends. After describing our datasets (§ 3), we present our
method for cellular address identification, and report on its vali-
dation and early results in Section 4. We present an approach that
builds on these ideas for detecting cellular access networks (§ 5) and
apply it to analyze some key features of different cellular networks
(§ 6). We discuss some of the observed global trends in Section 7)
and close with a summary of our findings and some of its impli-
cations. We conclude in Section 8 with some final thoughts and
future research directions.
2 BACKGROUND & MOTIVATION
Cellular access technology continues to improve at rapid pace, with
existing LTE deployments capable of supporting data rates up to 100
Mbps. The next generation of wireless technology – 5G – is expected
to support data rates up to 1Gbps [22]. The improved performance
and the proliferation of advanced wireless technologies are driving
exponential growth on cellular traffic.
Given its increasing importance, all Internet stakeholders – from
users and content providers to content delivery networks, opera-
tors, researchers and policy makers – could benefit from a compre-
hensive understanding of cellular access. Content providers and
delivery networks, could better diagnose and address performance
issues in the wild. Researchers and operators could better under-
stand how networks are being used around the world and identify
potential trends, while policy makers could have a firmer statistical
footing for investment decisions.
Distinguishing cellular traffic within more general traffic by mo-
bile devices is a challenging problem. “Mobile” devices describe
a property of the device itself, typically a smartphone or tablet,
whereas a “mobile” connection describes the type of access con-
nection. We refer to mobile connections strictly as connections
traversing cellular access technologies, and focus on the scope and
deployment of cellular connectivity.
2.1 Related Work
Information about cellular networks comes from two main sources:
academic research and industry reports. Prior academic work on
cellular network characterization has typically followed one of
two models, either relatively small detailed studies involving in-
strumented handsets or flow-level analysis from a single mobile
operator. Industry reports present high-level analysis and global
trends of the current and future Internet, sacrificing specificity for
global coverage.
These prior approaches make trade-offs between the coverage of
their results and the level of detail of their findings – from “broad
and coarse” views found in most industry reports to “narrow and
detailed” perspectives collected from instrumented devices. Table 1
presents a summary of these trade-offs within prior work, com-
paring existing approaches across the granularity of their results,
whether they provide a global view, and if they provide a compara-
tive view of cellular and fixed-line traffic.
Instrumented handsets provide the highest level of detail, and
today are the only way to obtain all of a device’s context, includ-
ing location and radio conditions. This approach has been used to
explore cellular network infrastructure [33, 38, 40], measure perfor-
mance [16, 23, 36], and understand mobile device behavior [12, 13].
While detailed in their measurements, these approaches’ typically
limited coverage hampers their ability to observe global trends on
global cellular connectivity.
Flow-level analysis from cellular operators allow for more gen-
eral statements on cellular network behavior since they typically
cover orders of magnitude more users over continuous time spans.
Several efforts have explored the traffic patterns of cellular net-
works using this approach, including Shafiq et al. [37] and Zhang
et al. [41]. Other work has looked at more specific phenomena,
including the dominant share of video in mobile networks [11], or
the impact of caching on mobile devices [31]. While providing a
in-depth view of a given network, such studies capture only the
perspective of a single operators. As we later show (§6) cellular
networks vary greatly in their size and configuration.
Often quoted industry reports on the state of the current and
future of the Internet, such as Cisco VNI report [8], the Sandvine
Global Internet Phenomena Report [34, 35], and Akamai State of
the Internet Report [5], now include a mobile component, while
some more recent survey focus exclusively on mobile networks (e.g..
Ericsson Mobility Report [10] and OpenSignal’s State of Mobile
Networks [26]. The majority of these reports rely on proprietary
company data and survey data from other sources to explore trends
and draw estimations on number of devices, subscriptions or mobile
traffic.

Each of these industry reports attempts to capture the global
state of mobile networks, but does so across different axes and gran-
ularities of coverage. The Sandvine reports [34, 35], for instance,
presents comparisons between mobile and fixed-line access at the
application level, but does not compare the magnitude of traffic
between these two access types. Others capture only performance
characteristics of mobile networks, such as the Akamai [5] and
OpenSignal [26] reports. Only the Cisco [8] and Ericsson [10] re-
ports provide information which compares the relative impact of
cellular networks on overall Internet traffic, yet, even in these cases
only offers a comparison of global aggregates. As we show later in
Section 7, the variability of cellular usage varies widely across con-
tinents, countries, and even ASes, requiring finer grained analysis
for true understanding.
Despite these numerous reports, we are still left without a com-
prehensive understanding of the impact and magnitude of cellular
access networks around the globe. Our approach allows the explo-
ration of large-scale trends across operators and regions, while also
providing with information at an IP level of detail. Unlike most
industry reports which are irreproducible, and based on propri-
etary data, our approach is easily replicated by individual network
services for analysis across their own clients.
3 DATASET
We leverage the vantage point of one of the largest worldwide
CDNs, which receives trillions of requests per day. In particular, we
rely on two different information sources from the CDN’s monitor-
ing platform: real-user-monitoring beacons (BEACON) and overall
platform demand measurements (DEMAND). These sources com-
bine the view from over 200,000 vantage points distributed around
the world, and includes data from over 46,000 autonomous sys-
