## Abstract
The rapid growth of the mobile internet has inspired numerous industry reports that detail the number of devices and subscriptions sold, as well as the increase in mobile traffic, both WiFi and cellular. However, despite the abundance of such reports, a comprehensive understanding of the global impact of cellular networks remains elusive.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of global cellular networks. We introduce an approach to accurately identify cellular network IP addresses using the Network Information API, a non-standard JavaScript API available in several mobile browsers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various cellular network configurations. By leveraging the vantage point of one of the world’s largest Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), with servers in 1,450 networks and clients distributed across 245 countries, we characterize cellular access globally.

Our findings reveal that most cellular networks are mixed, sharing both fixed-line and cellular devices, necessitating prefix-level identification rather than Autonomous System Number (ASN) level. We identified over 350,000 /24 and 23,000 /48 cellular IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes, respectively. Using address-level traffic data from the same CDN, we calculated that cellular traffic constitutes 16.2% of the CDN's global traffic. The importance of cellular traffic varies significantly by country, ranging from nearly 96% in Ghana to just 12.1% in France.

## 1. Introduction
The exponential growth of the mobile internet, with over 11 billion devices connected by 2020, and its economic implications have driven several reports detailing the number of devices sold, 3G/4G subscriptions per region, and the increase in mobile traffic (both WiFi and cellular). Despite these reports, a clear understanding of the global impact of cellular networks is still lacking.

Several challenges contribute to this gap. It is difficult to determine whether a particular IP address belongs to a cellular or fixed-line user, especially in mixed networks where both types of users coexist. Additionally, knowing the device type (e.g., smartphone or tablet) is limited, as most mobile devices have multiple interfaces and users often offload cellular traffic to WiFi when available. While detailed information can be obtained from instrumented devices or network operator data, scaling such studies is challenging.

A comprehensive understanding of cellular access has broad applications for various stakeholders, including content providers, delivery networks, researchers, operators, and policymakers. For content providers and delivery networks, identifying access technology would help diagnose and address performance issues. Researchers and operators could better understand global network usage and identify trends, while policymakers could make more informed investment decisions.

In this paper, we address the challenge of estimating the relative importance of cellular networks globally. Our key contributions include:
1. An approach to accurately identify cellular network addresses using client browser signals, demonstrated in mixed networks.
2. A first-of-its-kind study characterizing global cellular network configuration and usage.

Key findings include:
- Identification of 350,000 /24 IPv4 subnets and 23,000 /48 IPv6 subnets, comprising 7.3% and 1.2% of active IP address space, respectively.
- Discovery of 668 cellular ASes, with 58.6% being mixed networks.
- High concentration of traffic in a small fraction of cellular subnets.
- Cellular traffic represents 16.2% of all global traffic, with significant variation across countries and continents.
- Limited deployment of IPv6 in global cellular networks.

## 2. Background & Motivation
Cellular access technology is rapidly improving, with existing LTE deployments supporting data rates up to 100 Mbps and 5G expected to support up to 1 Gbps. This improved performance and the proliferation of advanced wireless technologies are driving exponential growth in cellular traffic.

All internet stakeholders, including users, content providers, delivery networks, operators, researchers, and policymakers, could benefit from a comprehensive understanding of cellular access. This includes better diagnostics and performance improvements, understanding global network usage, and making informed investment decisions.

Distinguishing cellular traffic from general mobile device traffic is challenging. "Mobile" devices describe the device itself, typically a smartphone or tablet, while a "mobile" connection describes the type of access. We focus on connections traversing cellular access technologies.

### 2.1 Related Work
Information about cellular networks comes from academic research and industry reports. Academic work typically involves detailed studies with instrumented handsets or flow-level analysis from a single mobile operator. Industry reports provide high-level analysis and global trends but lack specificity.

These approaches balance coverage and detail, from broad and coarse views in industry reports to narrow and detailed perspectives from instrumented devices. Table 1 summarizes these trade-offs, comparing existing approaches across granularity, global view, and comparative analysis of cellular and fixed-line traffic.

Instrumented handsets provide the highest level of detail but have limited coverage, hindering their ability to observe global trends. Flow-level analysis from cellular operators covers more users but captures only a single operator's perspective. Industry reports, such as Cisco VNI, Sandvine, and Akamai, provide global trends but lack detailed comparisons of cellular and fixed-line traffic.

Despite these reports, a comprehensive understanding of the global impact of cellular networks is still lacking. Our approach allows for large-scale trend analysis across operators and regions, providing detailed IP-level information and reproducibility.

## 3. Dataset
We leverage the vantage point of one of the largest worldwide CDNs, which receives trillions of requests daily. We use two data sources from the CDN's monitoring platform: real-user-monitoring beacons (BEACON) and overall platform demand measurements (DEMAND). These sources combine data from over 200,000 vantage points and 46,000 autonomous systems, providing a global perspective on cellular access.
