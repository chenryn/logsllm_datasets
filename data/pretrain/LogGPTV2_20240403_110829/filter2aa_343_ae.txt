### Single Sign-On (SSO) with Kerberos Authentication

When a user logs in, they enter their username and password in the login window. After this initial authentication, the user does not need to re-enter their credentials for Apple file services, mail services, or other services that use Kerberos authentication. To leverage the SSO feature, both users and services must be configured for Kerberos authentication and share the same Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) server.

For user accounts stored in an LDAP directory on Mac OS X Server version 10.3, if the password type is set to Open Directory, these accounts automatically use the server’s built-in KDC. This configuration enables automatic setup for Kerberos and SSO. Similarly, the server's Kerberized services also use the built-in KDC and are automatically configured for SSO. Other servers may require additional configuration to use the Mac OS X Server KDC. Servers running Mac OS X Server version 10.3 can be easily configured to use the built-in KDC of another server running the same version.

### Shadow and Crypt Passwords

Shadow and crypt passwords do not rely on the Kerberos or Open Directory Password Server infrastructure for validation. Both methods transmit a scrambled form (hash) of the user’s password over the network and store a hashed version of the password, but they differ in where the password is stored.

- **Crypt Passwords**: These are stored as a hash in the user account, making them susceptible to capture from other computers on the network. This method, historically called basic authentication, is compatible with software that needs direct access to user records. For example, Mac OS X versions 10.1 and earlier expect to find a crypt password stored in the user account.

- **Shadow Passwords**: These are stored as multiple hashes in a file on the same computer as the directory domain. Since the password is not stored in the user account, it is less vulnerable to network capture. Each user’s shadow password is stored in a separate, protected file (shadow password file) that can only be read by the root user. Only local user accounts can have a shadow password; shared directory accounts cannot.

Shadow passwords primarily use the SHA-1 hash function and also store NT and LAN Manager hashes for backward compatibility with Windows SMB file and print services. These hashes enable Windows personal file sharing from a Mac OS X computer and authenticate Windows file and print services provided by Mac OS X Server. Additionally, shadow passwords support cached authentication for mobile user accounts.

### Supported Services and Encryption

- **Crypt Passwords**: Support APOP, CRAM-MD5, Digest-MD5, MS-CHAPv2, and WebDAV-Digest for secure transmission over the network using the DHX authentication method. They have a maximum length of eight bytes (eight ASCII characters).

- **Shadow Passwords**: Use the first 128 characters for NT authentication and the first 14 characters for LAN Manager authentication. They support NT and LAN Manager for network-secure authentication.

Both shadow and crypt passwords are encrypted using one-way hash functions, which generate a consistent encrypted value from specific input but cannot recreate the original password. Mac OS X validates passwords by applying the hash function to the entered password and comparing it to the stored value. If they match, the password is valid.

### Cracking Readable Passwords

Crypt passwords, stored directly in user accounts, are more susceptible to cracking. Shared directory domains are accessible over the network, and tools like Workgroup Manager or command-line utilities can read user records, including passwords. A malicious user could copy these records and use techniques to crack the passwords, leading to unauthorized access.

To mitigate this risk, use strong, complex passwords containing letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using actual words and include both uppercase and lowercase letters.

### LDAP Bind Authentication

For user accounts in an LDAP directory on a non-Apple server, Open Directory uses simple LDAP bind authentication. It sends the name and password to the LDAP directory server. If the server finds a matching user record and password, authentication succeeds. Simple LDAP bind is insecure because it transmits clear text passwords. Secure it by using SSL to encrypt all communications with the LDAP directory.

### Open Directory Planning

#### General Guidelines

If you do not need to share user and resource information among multiple Mac OS X computers, minimal planning is required. Ensure that all necessary users are defined in the local directory domain. For shared information, set up at least one shared directory domain.

#### Controlling Data Accessibility

With multiple shared directory domains, you can control data visibility by distributing directory information across different domains. Store administrative data in a shared directory domain accessible to all computers, and restrict other data to specific subsets of computers.

#### Simplifying Data Changes

Organize search policies to minimize the number of places data needs to change. Plan for ongoing events such as new users, server changes, and printer relocations. Make each directory domain applicable to all relevant computers to avoid redundant updates.

#### Estimating Requirements

Consider the capacity of each directory domain, including database performance and the number of simultaneous client connections. A Mac OS X Server version 10.3 can handle up to 250 simultaneous client connections, but actual capacity depends on usage patterns.

#### Identifying Servers

Select servers with restricted physical and network access, high-availability technologies, and adequate capacity. Choose servers that will not be frequently replaced and can accommodate growing directory domains.

#### Replicating Open Directory Services

Replication improves performance and redundancy by moving directory information closer to users and providing backup in case of failure. The primary server (Open Directory master) updates replicas, either continuously or on a schedule. Ensure time synchronization between the master and replicas.

#### Security

Secure Open Directory masters and replicas with physical security, dedicated servers, and firewalls. Restrict ports to those used for directory, authentication, and administration. Use RAID sets and uninterruptible power supplies for added redundancy.

#### Management Tools

Use Server Admin, Directory Access, and Workgroup Manager for graphical management. Command-line tools and Terminal are also available for advanced management.
