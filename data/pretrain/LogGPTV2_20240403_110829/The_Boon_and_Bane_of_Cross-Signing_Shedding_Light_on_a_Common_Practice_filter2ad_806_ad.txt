repeatedly cross-signed the XS-Cert DoD Root CA2. However, in
contrast to the former XS-Certs, name constraint extensions limit
these cross-signs to issue for the U.S. Government only.
5.2.2 Cross-Signs of the Swiss Government. In 2016, the Swiss Gov-
ernment created the Swiss Government Public Trust Standard CA 02
intermediate which was cross-signed by QuoVadis Enterprise Trust
CA 2 G3 in 2017. Positively, QuoVadis used X509v3 Name Constraints
to white-list domains for which these cross-signs are allowed to
issue certificates. However, QuoVadis did not set the critical flag
for this extension, i.e., implementations are allowed to ignore it.
Consequently, the cross-signs could yield undesired trust paths for
software that does not implement X509v3 Name Constraints. This
especially could affect applications that derive trusted roots from
root stores of Mozilla, Google, or Apple as these do not establish a
valid path for the original intermediate (contrarily to Microsoft’s
root store). QuoVadis used its CRL to revoke the cross-signs in mid
2019, but only CRLSet adopted this revocation. The Swiss Govern-
ment did not misuse this opportunity: All 1,039 certificates observed
in our measurements are part of the white-listed domains.
Contrarily, Baltimore CyberTrust Root did not set up name con-
straints when it cross-signed Swiss Government SSL CA 01 (an in-
termediate issued in 2014 by Swiss Government Root CA II which
is included in Microsoft’s root store since 2016). Until its expiry in
2017, this cross-sign allowed the Swiss CA to issue certificates with
valid trust paths to all major root stores. In total, 756 certificates
validate under these circumstances; 9 of them are not part of the
white-listed domains, but still part of the Swiss top-level domain.
We describe three more cross-signs of state-controlled CAs when
discussing DigiCert in the light of ownership changes (Section 5.6.2).
Takeaway: Due to the extensive cross-signing in the FPKI, only
few trust anchors to the Web-PKI added many new trust paths. This
highlights the need for mechanisms that provide CAs with better
insight on the effect on trust paths before they cross-sign a certificate.
Furthermore, enforcing short validity periods for intermediates could
limit the impact of unexpected trust paths.
5.3 The Good: Bootstrapping of new CAs
In contrast to the previous cases which show security problems of
cross-signing, we now focus on the benefits of cross-signing. Espe-
cially for new CAs, inclusion into root stores is a lengthy process.
Obtaining a cross-sign from a broadly trusted root or intermediate
enables a CA to start its business while pursuing the process to
include certificates into root stores. In our dataset, we can iden-
tify such bootstrapping help for Let’s Encrypt, the China Internet
Network Information Center (CNNIC), and GoDaddy. Furthermore,
CyberTrust bootstrapped trust in Actalis Authentication CA G2
when Actalis’ root had not yet been trusted (cf. Section 5.1.3). We
provide a full list of involved CAs, e.g., COMODO, Digicert, WoSign,
Globalsign, AffirmTrust, and government CAs, in Appendix B.2.
5.3.1 Bootstrapping Let’s Encrypt. Let’s Encrypt launched as non-
profit Certificate Authority in 2015. It significantly increased the
amount of secured Internet communication by automating the cer-
tificate issuing process and providing certificates for free.
However, to provide this service early on, it had to depend on a
cross-sign by a widely trusted root for more than 5 years. Specifi-
cally, Let’s Encrypt will first start to default to its own ISRG Root
CCS ’20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
Jens Hiller, Johanna Amann, and Oliver Hohlfeld
starting September 29, 2020 [43]. Before, IdenTrust helped to boot-
strap trust for Let’s Encrypt. To this end, its DST Root CA X3 cross-
signed four intermediates originally issued by the ISRG Root X1, a
root of the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) which man-
ages Let’s Encrypt. As ISRG Root X1 was initially not included in
root stores, IdenTrust was the sole trust anchor for Let’s Encrypt
certificates enabling a fast ramp up of the service [42].
Looking at the details, Let’s Encrypt uses four intermediate XS-
Certs. Let’s Encrypt Authority X1 and X2 are no more actively used
[42] (but not revoked and still valid until the end of 2020). In contrast
to newer cross-signs, IdenTrust prevents the X1 and X2 cross-signs
from issuing certificates for the top-level domain .mil. The more
recent Let’s Encrypt Authority X3 is currently used by Let’s Encrypt
to issue (leaf) certificates and remains valid until 2021-10 (original)
and 2021-03 (cross-sign). Finally, Let’s Encrypt Authority X4 serves
as backup, but will expire at the same time as X3.
5.4.1 Expanding Trust. Some root certificates are not included in
all major root stores. We find that CAs broadly use cross-signs
to close these holes in the root-store coverage, enhancing their
trust. E.g., a cross-sign provides Entrust Root Certification Authority
- G2 with trust paths for Mozilla. Similarly, USERTrust cross-signed
AddTrust Qualified CA Root and AddTrust Class 1 CA Root to pro-
vide trust for Microsoft and the grid PKI. On the downside, as
aforementioned, these additional trust paths complicate certificate
revocations. Bootstrapping (cf. Section 5.3) is a special case of this
trust-expanding cross-signing. The count in Table 1 excludes boot-
strapping cases. Furthermore, we distinguish cases that extend only
the validity period. E.g., GlobalSign Domain Validation CA - SHA256
- G2 originally used trust paths via GlobalSign Root CA - R3, while a
cross-sign by GlobalSign Root CA extends the trust by several years.
5.4.2 Alternative Paths. Often, multiple certificates of a XS-Cert
provide valid paths to the same root store. This approach provides
fall-back trust: it proactively maintains alternative paths to deal
with unexpected revocations or removals. E.g., the intermediate XS-
Certs for Servision Inc., XiPS, and KAGOYA JAPAN Inc. – originally
issued by GoDaddy’s ValiCert Class 1 Policy Validation Authority –
were cross-signed by SECOM’s Security Communication RootCA1
in 2012. The cross-signs provided readily usable fall-back paths
when the originally issuing ValiCert certificate was removed from
Mozilla and Google root stores due to its 1024 bit RSA key [11, 12].
Note that most cross-signs establish alternative paths as issuing
CA certificates are often trusted in many root stores. The count
in Table 1 only lists XS-Certs whose sole outcome are alternative
paths, i.e., it includes only XS-Certs that do not expand the trust.
Takeaway: Cross-Signing enables large root store coverage if issu-
ing CAs span only a subset of root stores. Likewise, cross-signing can
provide alternative trust paths to proactively deal with CA revocations
and removals. Both ensures a non-disruptive user experience. However,
multiple trust paths for a certificate can also lead to incomplete revo-
cations and thus challenge the security of PKIs (cf. Section 5.1). Using
cross-signing for these purposes thus necessitates better mechanisms
to mitigate these security problems. We discuss possible solutions such
as better logging and limited lifetimes for XS-Certs in Section 6.
5.5 Cross-Signing Eases the Transition to New
Cryptographic Algorithms
Security guidelines by entities like the CAB Forum motivate CAs
to support advancements in cryptography early on, e.g., new sig-
nature algorithms. To maintain backward compatibility for legacy
implementations, CAs use cross-signs to establish alternative trust
paths that support new algorithms. Legacy clients that do not sup-
port the new algorithms can still use the old trust paths. We find
this happening commonly with intermediate XS-Certs. For root cer-
tificates this approach is not required - their self-signed signatures
are typically not checked by clients [10]. In these cases, the CA can
just issue a new intermediate that uses the new algorithms.
To give some examples, the Virginia Tech Global Qualified Server
CA intermediate was issued with a SHA1 signature by Trusted Root
CA G2 (GlobalSign) in 2012. In December 2014, i.e., approaching the
deadline for deprecating issuance based on SHA1 [37], GlobalSign
cross-signed the intermediate from the Trusted Root CA SHA256 G2.
The SHA1 intermediate was revoked in January 2017.
Even after the switch to the own ISRG roots, the cross-signs will
be beneficial: Legacy clients that do not include the ISRG roots in
their root store can fall back to the IdenTrust trust path [42].
5.3.2 Entrust Helped CNNIC. Similar to Let’s Encrypt, the Chinese
CNNIC obtained bootstrapping help from an established CA; En-
trust.net Secure Server Certification Authority issued a CNNIC SSL
intermediate in 2007. Shortly after the inclusion of CNNIC ROOT
into root stores (e.g. 2009 for Mozilla [9]), the CNNIC ROOT cross-
signed this intermediate, creating an alternate trust path.
5.3.3 GoDaddy – Internal Bootstrapping via Subsidiary. Similarly,
GoDaddy used cross-signing to bootstrap trust into its CA certifi-
cates [7] when it entered the certificate business in 2004. In contrast
to the previous cases, however, it used an internal cross-sign. Par-
ticularly, GoDaddy started off with the root certificates GoDaddy
Class 2 CA and Starfield Class 2 CA and cross-signed them with
ValiCert’s root ValiCert Class 2 Policy Validation CA (created 1999).
Interestingly, GoDaddy acquired ValiCert just the year before, prob-
ably already preparing for its new business. Until its removal from
root stores around 2014, the ValiCert root thus bootstrapped trust
to Mozilla, Android, and Apple for the new certificates.
GoDaddy later bootstrapped a root for Amazon: When Amazon
created its Amazon Root CA 1 in 2015, an immediate cross-sign by
Starfield Services Root CA - G2 established trust right away whereas
it took years for Amazon’s root to arrive in root stores. E.g., Mozilla
and Google included it in 2017 and Apple even later in 2018.
Takeaway: Cross-Signing enables new CAs to already start their
business during the process of including their roots into root stores.
Without such a cross-sign, the long periods for inclusion and sufficient
propagation of root stores of several years could be prohibitive for new
companies in this business.
5.4 Expanding Trust and Alternative Paths
Any cross-sign either (i) expands the trust to more root stores, i.e.,
provides trust paths to not yet covered root stores, (ii) extends the
validity period in covered root stores, or (iii) adds alternative paths
to root stores already covered by other certificates in the XS-Cert. A
XS-Cert often causes several of (i)–(iii); Table 1 only counts them to
their primary case (i > ii > iii). We briefly describe some XS-Certs
in the following and refer to Appendix B.3 for further examples.
The Boon and Bane of Cross-Signing: Shedding Light on a Common Practice in Public Key Infrastructures
CCS ’20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
Other intermediates switched to SHA2 long before the official
deprecation: The US Government (Common Policy) issued a SHA1
intermediate Betrusted Production SSP CA A1 in 2008 and created a
SHA256 cross-sign in 2010 using Federal Common Policy CA. The
SHA1 intermediate was revoked in 2011.
Actalis obtained a SHA1 cross-sign from Baltimore CyberTrust
Root for its SHA256 intermediate Actalis Authentication Root CA at
time of original issuance. Likewise, the Japanese Government issued
a cross-sign for ApplicationCA2 Sub to provide parallel support for
SHA1 and SHA256 on creation of the intermediate in 2013.
Keynectis cross-signed its intermediate KEYNECTIS Extended
Validation CA with roots of its subsidiaries Certplus (Class 2 Primary
CA) and OpenTrust (OpenTrust CA for AATL G1). The cross-signs
offer SHA1, SHA256, SHA512 and ECDSA-with-SHA384 signatures.
Takeaway: Cross-signing can establish new trust paths that fully
support new cryptographic algorithms. This enables state-of-the-art
clients to achieve better security but at the same time maintains
backward compatibility for legacy clients which validate the same
certificate with the help of older paths. We expect CAs to put similar
backward compatibility procedures in place once the use of a succes-
sor for SHA2, like SHA3, becomes popular. However, we posit that
backward compatibility should be kept for a limited time only—using
short certificate validity periods—to push application developers to
support state-of-the-art cryptography.
5.6 Effect of Ownership-Changes on XS-Certs
In this section, we analyze the effect of CA acquisitions on existing
cross-signs. Cross-signs, especially across organizations, add con-
tractual obligations—and necessitate trust granting CAs to check
the actions of CAs they cross-signed. Thus, we are interested if new
owners revoke cross-signs that were created by acquired CAs. Sim-
ilarly, we are interested if cross-signs are revoked once the owner
of a cross-signed CA changes.
5.6.1 Cross-Signs Outlive Ownership-Changes. The Network Solu-
tions Certificate Authority root has been repeatedly cross-signed by
members of Comodo’s trust network. This process spanned several
ownership changes. The original root was created 2006. At this
time, Network Solutions had been owned by Pivotal Equity for
three years. In the same year, Comodo’s UTN-USERFirst-Hardware
cross-signed the root twice. After Network Solutions was sold to
General Atlantic, Comodo’s AddTrust External CA Root cross-signed
the certificate in 2010. Furthermore, we find a cross-sign by Ad-
dTrust: this intermediate has been valid since 2000—when Network
Solutions was owned by VeriSign—but it likely was backdated (cf.
Section 5.7.1). All these cross-sings outlived the acquisition of Net-
work Solutions by web.com in 2011 and remain valid until 2020,
thus spanning at least two ownership changes.
We also find cases in which the CAs that issue cross-sign cer-
tificates changed owners. When Digicert created the DigiCert High
Assurance EV Root CA in 2006, it was cross-signed by Entrust.net Se-
cure Server Certificate Authority and Entrust.net Certificate Authority.
3 years later, Thoma Bravo acquired Entrust and sold it to Datacard
in 2013, which rebranded it to Entrust Datacard. Despite these own-
ership changes, the cross-signs of Digicert’s root remained valid
(until 2014 and 2015), making the new owners responsible for trust
paths of certificates issued by DigiCert9. This raises the question
if the new owners were aware of the cross-signs - and decided to
keep them, or if they simply were not aware of their existence.
5.6.2 DigiCert – Internal Islands and External Legacy Cross-Signing.
In the DigiCert group, most XS-Certs were created before DigiCert
acquired the corresponding CAs. Thus, we predominantly find
internal cross-signs within each subsidiary and only few cross-signs
across DigiCert subsidiaries. Most cross-signs originate from times
of VeriSign, Verizon, and QuoVadis. DigiCert only occasionally used
the acquired certificates to cross-sign its own DigiCert roots.
When acquiring Verizon in 2015, DigiCert also became respon-
sible for external XS-Certs. First, Verizon cross-signed root certifi-
cates of WellsFargo in 2013 and 2015. All corresponding intermedi-
ates were revoked by the CA’s CRL and Mozilla’s OneCRL in 2017,
when the roots were removed from all root stores (after request by
WellsFargo [15]), except for Apple. Similarly, Verizon cross-signed
Certipost E-Trust Primary Normalized CA providing this former only
Microsoft-trusted root a broad trust coverage.
Verizon also cross-signed state-controlled CAs which is poten-
tially problematic (cf. Section 5.2). In 2010 and 2013, it cross-signed
the Swiss Government root, increasing its trust beyond Apple and
Microsoft. Similarly, it cross-signed the Belgium Root CA2 and Por-
tugal’s SCEE ECRaizEstado–some of them were later revoked in
2018 due to a series of misissuances [21]. The acquisition of Verizon
made Digicert responsible for these cross-signs of state-controlled
CAs. Thus, cross-signs did not only provide state-controlled CAs
with large trust coverage, but these cross-signs also faced ownership
changes which increase the risk for unnoticed problems.
We describe further XS-Certs with ownership changes and pro-
vide details on Digicert’s cross-signs in Appendix B.5.
Takeaway: Considering the frequent cross-signs across CAs, po-
tential new owners must—before acquiring a CA—review existing
issued and received cross-signs and corresponding obligations. Sim-
ilarly, cross-signing CAs must be informed when a cross-signed CA
changes its owner. Both requires an easily accessible and verifiable
store of XS-Certs as we suggest in Section 6.
5.7 The Ugly: Potentially Problematic Practices
and Missing Transparency
In this section, we highlight practices of CAs that—while not ex-
plicitly forbidden—are frowned upon by root store maintainers [67]
or make it hard to assess the legitimacy of existing trust.
5.7.1 Backdating of Cross-signs. Comodo’s AddTrust External CA
Root backdates several cross-signs, i.e., it sets the not before field
to a date several years before the actual issuance. We used crt.sh
to verify that the early not before dates are not caused by re-issued
root certificates. Backdating is explicitly forbidden if it bypasses a
