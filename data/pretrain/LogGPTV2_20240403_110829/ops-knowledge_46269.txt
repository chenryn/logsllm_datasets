User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Please analyze the following multiple lines of logs
 0 04:30:31 Info 00000004 IAdvancedInstallerAwareStore_ResolvePendingTransactions (call 1) (flags = 00000004, progress = NULL, phase = 0, pdwDisposition = @0xb6fd90
 1 00:00:46 Info 00000004 IAdvancedInstallerAwareStore_ResolvePendingTransactions (call 1) (flags = 00000004, progress = NULL, phase = 0, pdwDisposition = @0x116fa70
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: <*> IAdvancedInstallerAwareStore_ResolvePendingTransactions (call <*>) (flags = <*>, progress = <*>, phase = <*>, pdwDisposition = @<*>
B: Ending TrustedInstaller initialization.
C: <*>@<*>/<*>/<*>:<*>:<*>:<*>.<*> WcpInitialize (wcp.dll version <*>) called (stack @<*>)
D: Loaded Servicing Stack <*> with Core: <*>\cbscore.dll

Assistant: Answer: A
