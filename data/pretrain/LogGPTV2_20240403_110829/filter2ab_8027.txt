**ATT&CK ID:** M1017  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Training

**Description:**
Train users to be vigilant and suspicious of certificate errors. Adversaries may use their own certificates in an attempt to intercept HTTPS traffic. Certificate errors typically occur when the application's certificate does not match the one expected by the host. Educating users to recognize and respond appropriately to such errors can help mitigate the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Key Points:**
- **Vigilance:** Encourage users to be cautious and attentive to any certificate warnings or errors.
- **Interception Attempts:** Adversaries may use self-signed or forged certificates to intercept and decrypt HTTPS traffic.
- **Certificate Mismatch:** A certificate error indicates a discrepancy between the presented certificate and the one expected by the host, which could be a sign of a security threat.
- **User Education:** Provide training on how to identify and handle certificate errors, including steps to verify the legitimacy of the certificate and the appropriate actions to take if a warning is encountered.
