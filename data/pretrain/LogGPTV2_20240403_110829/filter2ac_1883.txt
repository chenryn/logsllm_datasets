### Title: An Attacker's Perspective on Docker: Approaching Multi-Container Applications

**Abstract:**

Containerization, exemplified by Docker, has become increasingly popular among developers of large-scale applications. While this technology simplifies many aspects of development and deployment, it also introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Unlike traditional monolithic applications, which often require specialized knowledge of specific programming languages and execution environments, multi-container applications can be more easily explored and exploited using well-known system- and network-level techniques.

This presentation aims to provide experienced penetration testers with a comprehensive understanding of containerization and its implications for offensive operations. Using Docker as a case study, we will explore the unique challenges and opportunities presented by multi-container applications. Attendees will gain practical insights into post-exploitation techniques for these environments, presented in a manner that minimizes jargon and focuses on actionable, real-world scenarios.
