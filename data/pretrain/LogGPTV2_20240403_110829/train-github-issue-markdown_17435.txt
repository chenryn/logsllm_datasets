# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Today, custom-zone-sets are stored in the zones-settings.json file, along with
app-zone-history and devices trees. This makes it difficult to backup or share
configurations between people / computers.
# Proposed Solution
Propose moving custom-zone-sets into a directory where each custom zone
setting is a separate file.
# Benefits
  * back up and restore custom zone sets
  * sharing custom zone sets or specific templates with community
