User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I fix Purple Screen of Death for ESX 5.5? I have a ESX 5.5 installed on my HP Proliant DL 180 G6 with a configuration of 
8X Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5540  @ 2.53GHz, 24 Gb RAM.

Recently the server has crashed four times, showing the Purple Screen of Death.
Once this happens all of the virtual machines on the server stops and crashes until I restart this server.

I don't exactly know what causes this error, is it hardware problem?

Update: I forgot to mention that the operating system is 5.5 Update 1 
and this is the image of the error

Assistant: By upgrading to at least ESX 5.5 Update 1.

Alternately, this is caused by guests with E1000 network adapters, so if updating isn't possible, or not possible immediately, you can always change the vNIC adapter type on the guests.

Of course, there is the off chance that this PSOD is caused by something else, but since you haven't posted any error log information, it's impossible to verify that your PSOD issue is the same one the rest of the world has been having with ESXi 5.x.  And, on that off chance, here's the VMware kb article on interpreting PSOD screens.
