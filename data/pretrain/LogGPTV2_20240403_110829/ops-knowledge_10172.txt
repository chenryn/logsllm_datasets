User: I have installed OpenStack swift python client (pip install python-swiftclient). However /usr/bin has swift executable (which I can not remove as it is owned by root) and is overriding python swift.
Requirement already satisfied: python-swiftclient in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages
Requirement already satisfied: requests>=1.1 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from python-swiftclient)
Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5.2 in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/six-1.10.0-py2.7.egg (from python-swiftclient)
Requirement already satisfied: futures>=3.0; python_version == "2.7" or python_version == "2.6" in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (from python-swiftclient)
However, I am unable to find python swift anywhere. Please let me know how to resolve this.
Many Thanks
Chen
Assistant: For me, Apple Swift is under /usr/bin/swift and python-swiftclient is under /usr/bin/local/swift. Explicitly invoking it as /usr/bin/local/swift works.
