I think that we should try to implement an official module like the Deno DOM
third-party module that includes the `DOMParser`. The whole part about Deno is
to mirror the Browser APIs, but we don't even have an official DOM Parser in
the std. I think that this should definitely be in the std as it is something
that is in every single browser shipped out of the box. I understand that the
`deno-dom` third party module does include a `DOMParser`, but there are a
couple of issues and if a module were created by Deno, it would be worked on
as a community. The author of the module did amazing at starting the project,
but we must have one included with Deno. Also, it would make Deno viable for
scraping which is **very important** for a lot of node users. Thank you for
your time!
