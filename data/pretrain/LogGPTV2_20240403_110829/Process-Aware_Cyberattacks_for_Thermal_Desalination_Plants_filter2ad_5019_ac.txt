of sensor signals during normal operation and replay these during
the attack. But, just replaying the recorded values while decreasing
the performance by a value grater than its steady state variation
can cause suspicion and eventual detection of the attack. So, the
adversary needs to find a balance between the decrease in perfor-
mance as a result of an attack and the normal operation of the plant.

5.2 Mechanical Failure Attacks
The ultimate goal of the adversary in this scenario is to cause
mechanical damage to the desalination plant. This can be performed
in numerous ways depending on the specific plant. In this paper,
however, we focus on an attack that can be performed on all thermal
desalination plants, since it assumes the presence of water pipes
and valves.
5.2.1 Water Hammer. Water hammer is a shock wave that is trans-
mitted through a hydrodynamic flow when its motion is suddenly
brought to a halt. Generally this huge spike in pressure is dissi-
pated quickly, but if the pipe system is incapable of handling such
a sudden spike in pressure, it might lead to some significant me-
chanical damage. Pressure profile of a wave moving in a fluid can
be represented as:
dP
dt
dv
dt
= ρa
(1)
where P represents pressure in the fluid, ρ represents the density
of the fluid, a refers to the speed of sound through the fluid, which
describes how quickly a pressure wave can propagate through the
pipe, v is the velocity of the flowing liquid, t is the time over which
the change in momentum occurs [15].
An abrupt change to the momentum of the fluid creates a pres-
sure wave that travels through the pipe and subjects the pipe system
to significant forces which increases the chance of mechanical dam-
age. In our experiments, we have calculated internal stresses and
displacement for studying the effect of the forces induced from the
water hammer attack.
6 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
6.1 Experimental Setup
For studying performance attacks, we use a MATLAB Simulink
model of an MSF desalination plant ported from [10]. This full-
order model has been tested and validated against real plant data
obtained from the Khubar II MSF plant in Saudi Arabia [3]. The
model is a 22 stage MSF desalination plant, which consists of 3 Heat
Rejection Sections and 19 Heat Recovery Sections. This process
model is defined by nine variables: brine pool height, brine flow
rate, salt mass fraction, brine temperature, distillate flow rate, distil-
late temperature, coolant temperature, vaporization rate, and stage
pressure. Mass and energy balance for both brine and distillate is
calculated for all the 22 stages and the brine heater. The brine and
distillate flow rate is calculated using its correlation with brine level
and distillate level respectively. Initial values for the components
used in our experiments are mentioned in Table 3.
Mass and energy equations for all stages except for the last stage
are written below [3].

here Dj is the distillate flow rate in stage j, C is orfice contraction co-
efficient, ρD, j is density of distillate, д is the gravitational constant

All the aforementioned equations are solved for each stage in
MATLAB Simulink model. Estimated financial loss has been cal-
culated by using the values presented in [14], considering a plant
capacity of 50,000 ton of distillate per day and a continuous unde-
tected attack operation of 5 years [1].
For evaluating the detrimental effects of water hammer in a
pipeline and estimate its mechanical response, we created a novel
computational framework using MATLAB and ANSYS. The analysis
consists of two steps.
(1) Control volume analysis: Analysis of dynamic response of
the fluid flow upon sudden valve closures using MATLAB.
(2) Finite element analysis: Analysis of the pipe segment in
response to the pressure wave computed in the previous
step (1) using ANSYS Mechanical.
The control volume analysis is performed using MATLAB. As
shown in Fig. 4, this model consists of the valve being attacked, a
pipe which is divided into 8 pipe segments, a sensor in the middle
of the pipe for recording flow rate and pressure values, reservoir A
and B used for establishing an initial flow in the pipe. The valve is
modeled using Variable Local Restriction block, which simulates the
pressure drop arising from a time-varying reduction in flow area
as in the case of valves. A sensing setup is employed for measuring
pressure and mass flow rate through the pipe during hammering.
Each pipe segment can experience pressure losses and unsteady
transient heating due to viscous friction and conductive heat trans-
fer through the pipe wall. Moreover, the dynamic compressibility
and fluid inertia effects are also included. Viscous friction is com-
puted using the Darcy-Weibach law [33], while the heat exchange
coefficient follows from the Nusselt number correlations [34]. The
control volume analysis deals with the conservation of mass, mo-
mentum and energy [12]. The mass conservation equation for a
single pipe segment (Fig. 4) can be written as,
dp

(cid:219)mA + (cid:219)mB = vρ

(9)
where (cid:219)mA and (cid:219)mB represents the mass flow rates through the
ports A and B of a pipe segment, v is the volume of the fluid in
the pipe segment, ρ is the isothermal liquid density, β is the bulk
modulus of the pipe, α represents the isobaric thermal expansion
coefficient, p is the liquid pressure in the pipe and T represents the
temperature in the pipe.

The momentum balance for the pipe segment is broken into two
parts, i.e., momentum conservation for the half pipe adjacent to
port A (Eq. 10) and the remaining half adjacent to port B (Eq. 11).

where A represents the pipe cross-sectional area, p, pA, pB are
the liquid pressures in the pipe, at port A and port B respectively.
Fv,A and Fv,B are the viscous dissipation forces between the pipe
volume center and ports A and B. This can be computed using
Eq. 12 depending on the flow regime in the pipe segment.
Here λ represents the pipe shape factor, ν is the kinematic vis-
cosity of the liquid. Leq is the equivalent length and D is the hy-
draulic diameter. f is the Darcy friction factor of the pipe and can
be computed using the Haaland approximation (Eq. 13) for flows in
turbulent regime [18].
