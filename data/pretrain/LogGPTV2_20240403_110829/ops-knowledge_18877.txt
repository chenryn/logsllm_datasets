User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can security devices (e.g. Snort, 日志易, WAFs, etc.) generate alerts when they aren't working as designed? APRA's CPS 234 regulation section 56 states:

An APRA-regulated entity would typically deploy appropriate
information security technology solutions which maintain the security
of information assets. Examples include firewalls, network access
control, intrusion detection/prevention devices, anti-malware,
encryption and monitoring/log analysis tools. The degree of reliance
placed on technology solutions for information security could
necessitate a heightened set of lifecycle controls, including but not
limited to:
...
&quot;detection techniques deployed which provide an alert if
information security-specific technology solutions are not working as
designed.&quot;

Is this possible? If so, can I get a couple of examples?

Assistant: None of these security devices you have listed have subsystems that can report on the integrity or availability of themselves. You will need to use an external piece of software to monitor your security devices.
