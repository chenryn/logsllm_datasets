**ATT&CK ID:** T0809  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Data Destruction

Adversaries may engage in data destruction as part of their operations. To achieve this, they might deploy or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on the target system. These actions can leave behind evidence of malicious activity. However, to minimize their footprint or as part of a standard post-intrusion cleanup process, adversaries may remove these non-native files and other associated data during the course of the intrusion.
