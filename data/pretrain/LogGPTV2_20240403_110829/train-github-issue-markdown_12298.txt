Here's the forum thread that covers the bug:
http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=44442
Basically, when using the Spring MVC JSP forms taglib in FreeMarker templates,
binding errors are not output by the  tag. Other tags seem to
work fine, however.
I'll attach an example project that shows the issue.
I've tried stepping through things in the debugger to see what's happening.
The error message is there, and it's being written to a buffer inside one of
hte Spring custom tags (although I was kind of lost at that point:)), but it
doesn't seem to make its way into the output.
Interestingly, if I use the form:errorssome message variation,
the "some message" is printed out (although it's not possible to get the real
errors, so this doesn't help much, just shows that the error is certainly
"there"). Also, I can use the FreeMarker macors that come with Spring MVC
(bind and showErrors) to display the error message.
