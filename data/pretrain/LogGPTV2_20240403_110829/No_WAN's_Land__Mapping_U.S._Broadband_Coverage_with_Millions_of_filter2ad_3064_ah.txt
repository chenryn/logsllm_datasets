### Analysis of Broadband Coverage Overstatements

#### Methodology and Results

For each major ISP that provides service to the address’s census block according to Form 477 data, we used the ISP's Broadband Availability Test (BAT) to determine coverage. The BAT returned one of three responses: it does not cover the address, it does not recognize the address, or an unknown response. We then completed the analysis as described in the main text. Table 12 presents the results.

Under these assumptions, we estimate that the FCC may overstate access to benchmark broadband for 4.61% of the population in the blocks we studied. Extrapolated nationally, this suggests that 14 million Americans have overstated access to benchmark broadband.

#### Excluding Local ISPs

We repeated our analysis while excluding local ISPs. In the main text, we treated local ISPs as covering all addresses in the census blocks where, according to the FCC’s data, they provide service. Here, we ignored local ISP coverage entirely. The criteria for labeling an address as covered or not covered are the same as in Section 4.3, except that we did not label addresses as covered if they only had coverage from a local ISP.

Table 13 presents the results of this analysis. We found that under this set of assumptions, the FCC may overstate access to benchmark broadband for 1.37% of our studied population. This result extrapolates to over 4.1 million Americans. Notably, this analysis has a less significant effect than the previous analysis, which treated unrecognized and unknown responses as indicating no coverage. These results reflect that the overwhelming majority of local ISP coverage overlaps with coverage by one or more major ISPs.

### Address and Population Coverage Overstatements

Table 11 summarizes the analysis of address and population coverage overstatements for any broadband coverage, as in Section 4.3, but treating a mix of non-covered and address-unrecognized BAT responses as non-coverage.

| State | Residential Addresses Covered by BATs | Population Covered by BATs |
|-------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Arkansas | 98.47% | 99.52% |
| Maine | 96.40% | 97.90% |
| Massachusetts | 99.87% | 96.59% |
| New York | 99.75% | 99.80% |
| North Carolina | 99.16% | 99.69% |

### Evaluation of Underreporting

To evaluate underreporting, we generated a set of test addresses by starting with the NAD address list, applying our NAD and USPS filtering for residential addresses, and filtering by FCC coverage data for areas where the ISP does not provide service. We then randomly sampled 1,000 addresses and queried each BAT with the ISP-specific set of test addresses.

Our findings indicate that coverage underreporting is rare compared to overstatements. BAT responses indicated that AT&T broadband service was available for 35 addresses, CenturyLink for 3 addresses, Charter for 0 addresses, and Frontier for 6 addresses. We note that our evaluation likely magnifies the possibility of underreporting because the FCC coverage data we rely on predates our BAT data collection. ISPs tend to increase their coverage footprints over time, so the current availability of service does not necessarily mean it was available at the mid-2018 Form 477 reporting deadline.

These results provide confidence that our focus on evaluating overstatements reflects the predominant source of inaccuracy in the FCC’s coverage data. Additionally, underreporting and overstatements are likely inversely related due to the coarse census block granularity of Form 477 data. An ISP that provides coverage to half the addresses in a census block will necessarily overstate coverage if it claims the entire block and underreport if it does not claim the block.
