• For every major ISP that provides service to the address’s
census block according to Form 477 data, the ISP’s BAT
returns that it does not cover the address, that it does not
recognize the address, or an unknown response.
We then complete the analysis as in the main text. Table 12
presents the results.
Under the above set of assumptions, we estimate that the FCC
may overstate access to benchmark broadband for 4.61% of the
population in the blocks we study. Extrapolated nationally, our
analysis indicates that 14 million Americans have overstated access
to benchmark broadband.
Excluding Local ISPs. We repeat our analysis while omitting
local ISPs. In the main text, we treat local ISPs as covering all

addresses in the census blocks where (according to the FCC’s data)
they provide service. Here, we ignore local ISP coverage entirely.
The criteria for labeling an address as covered or not covered
are the same as in Section 4.3, except that we do not label addresses
as covered for having coverage from a local ISP.
We then complete the analysis as in the main text. Table 13
presents the results.
We find that under this set of assumptions, the FCC may overstate
access to benchmark broadband for 1.37% of our studied popula-
tion. This result naively extrapolates to over 4.1 million Americans.
Notably, this analysis has a less significant effect than the previous
analysis of treating unrecognized and unknown responses as in-
dicating no coverage. These results reflect that the overwhelming
majority of local ISP coverage overlaps with coverage by one or
more major ISPs.

For each ISP, we generated a set of test addresses by starting
with the NAD address list, applying our NAD and USPS filtering for
residential addresses, filtering by FCC coverage data for where the
ISP does not provide service (rather than our ordinary filtering for
where an ISP does provide service), and finally randomly sampling
1,000 addresses. We then queried each BAT with the ISP-specific
set of test addresses.
We found that coverage underreporting appears to be rare in
comparison to coverage overstatements: BAT responses indicated
AT&T broadband service was available for 35 addresses, Centu-
ryLink for 3 addresses, Charter for 0 addresses, and Frontier for 6
addresses. We also note that our evaluation likely magnifies the
possibility of underreporting, because the FCC coverage data we
rely on predates our BAT data collection. ISPs tend to increase their
coverage footprints over time; that service is available now does
not mean service was available for the mid-2018 Form 477 reporting
deadline.
These results provide confidence that our focus on evaluating
overstatements reflects the predominant source of inaccuracy in
the FCC’s coverage data.
We further note that underreporting and overstatements are
likely inversely related due to Form 477 data’s coarse census block
granularity. An ISP that provides coverage to half the addresses in
a census block necessarily overstates coverage if it claims the block,
and underreports if it does not claim the block.
