## Abstract
As the attack surface and the number of security incidents in mobile communication networks increase, a common language for threat intelligence gathering and sharing among different parties becomes essential. In our previous work, we addressed this by developing the Bhadra framework, a domain-specific conceptual framework that captures adversarial behaviors in end-to-end communication over mobile networks. However, the acceptance or adoptability of the framework by the mobile communications industry remains unclear. In this work, we developed a threat modeling tool as a companion to Bhadra and conducted a user study with industry experts to evaluate the framework’s usefulness and explore its potential use cases beyond threat modeling and sharing. Our preliminary results indicate that the mobile communication industry would benefit from a threat modeling framework with a companion tool, making it a potential candidate for integration within work processes.

## 1. Motivation and Related Work
With the advent of IP-based stacks and new private players, the attack surface of mobile communication systems has drastically increased in recent years. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a common framework to study and understand its security implications. We filled this gap in our prior work by developing the Bhadra framework, a conceptual threat modeling framework that provides a taxonomy for describing adversarial behaviors in end-to-end mobile communication in a structured way. Bhadra takes inspiration from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, providing a taxonomy matrix that describes adversarial behaviors in tactics and techniques. While Bhadra shares similar and common tactical objectives as the ATT&CK framework, we found many techniques unique to the network environment and protocols used in mobile communication systems. For more details about Bhadra, refer to Figure 1 and the original paper [4].

As a concrete framework, Bhadra can provide a common language for threat intelligence gathering and sharing among different parties. However, there is still room for improvement. The mobile communications industry lacks both a conceptual framework and a clear picture of how threat modeling activities have been conducted in the past. Hence, in this work, we explore the acceptance and adoptability of the Bhadra framework by conducting a user study with experts in the mobile communications industry. Our contributions are as follows:
- To make the Bhadra framework more accessible and easier to use, we developed a web tool that supports the threat and attack modeling process.
- We conducted a user study with 11 participants to explore actual use cases of the framework, evaluate the usability of the tool, and assess the adoptability of the framework in terms of attack surface coverage and possible integration into daily work. We also gained insights into the clarity of the framework, such as whether its taxonomy is understandable by users.

## 2. Tool Development
We observed that many popular threat modeling frameworks, such as the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator and Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, are tightly coupled with their own supporting tools. This trend encouraged us to build a companion tool specifically for Bhadra, with an emphasis on usability and future needs. This section presents the design considerations and functionality of the tool we built.

### 2.1 Design Considerations
Since Bhadra takes its inspiration from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, it was natural to seek inspiration for the tool from the ATT&CK Navigator. Given that the Navigator is open-sourced and widely adopted, our initial attempt was to reuse and repurpose its code to serve as a companion tool for Bhadra. However, after a careful evaluation of the requirements and long-term development plans for Bhadra, we decided to build our tool from scratch.

First, we found that the ATT&CK Navigator is too complex for first-time users, whereas Bhadra requires a simple tool with minimal features that is easy and intuitive to use. The reason is that the mobile communications industry, which will be using Bhadra, does not commonly practice threat modeling, and a complex tool would discourage regular use. Second, the Navigator heavily benefits from the ATT&CK threat intelligence knowledge base, which provides detailed information, examples, and mitigation strategies. Since the Bhadra framework is still in its infancy, it lacks such a backend knowledge base. Therefore, we decided to build the infrastructure to host a threat intelligence knowledge base in the future.

Based on these design considerations, we built our tool to support the following components:
- **Frontend:** A simple user interface to support only the required features that Bhadra needs at this point.
- **Backend:** A backend server for easier management and collaboration on the knowledge base.
- **Extendable APIs:** APIs to allow the tool to be easily extended to support more features in the future.

It is important to note that while we provide APIs and a skeletal structure for the knowledge base with sample content, more concrete information is yet to be populated. This can only be achieved if the mobile communications security community actively participates and contributes.

### 2.2 Functional Components
The Bhadra threat modeling tool contains three main functional components:
- **Knowledge Base:** For threat intelligence sharing, including descriptions of techniques, related examples of attacks or vulnerabilities, mitigation and detection methods, and references.
- **Annotator:** Supports the necessary functions for modeling threats or attacks, such as marking related techniques, adding comments, and creating, reading, updating, and deleting a model and its metadata.
- **Pattern Analyzer:** Helps security analysts view the attack patterns by filtering relevant attacks based on techniques used. We use color coding to visualize the frequency of each technique being selected, enabling users to easily observe attack patterns and identify bottlenecks and the impact of each technique. An example is shown in Figure 2.

## 3. User Study
We aimed to understand the adoptability and acceptance of using the Bhadra framework and the tool we built for threat modeling in the mobile communications industry through a user study. Our target participants were those who need to perform and present security analysis on a daily basis. We recruited 11 participants from different teams across Nokia Corporation, one of the leading mobile network companies. Each participant was carefully chosen to represent feedback from a variety of roles (e.g., system architect, radio engineer, security consultant) and to ensure they had knowledge of different aspects of mobile networks.

We scheduled a one-hour interview with each participant to observe their behavior while modeling with the tool and facilitate an open discussion about the acceptance and use cases of the framework. Our user study consisted of two parts:

### 3.1 Adoptability
In the first part, we aimed to understand if the users could form a common understanding of Bhadra, such as from the name and description of the techniques. All participants were given an attack scenario of an IMSI Catcher [3]. We asked them to read through the technique descriptions in our tool and select the ones used in the attack. During the process, we probed questions such as “Does the name of the technique convey the same idea as the description?” and “Is the description clear?” to understand the perceived technique clarity. We looked specifically for any conflicting perceptions about the framework between the participants. Additionally, we observed the participants’ behavior and asked for their feedback on the ease of using and navigating the tool.

**Clarity:**
Participants stated that the names of the techniques are self-explanatory, and their rationale is clear from the description and examples. However, some confusion arose when choosing similar or repeated techniques within more than one tactic. From our discussions, we learned that this confusion stems from a lack of prior threat modeling experience.

**Coverage:**
Bhadra currently covers attack vectors from 2G to 4G but not 5G. Most participants were satisfied with the coverage, noting that the taxonomy is systematically categorized, and they find no missing techniques. They also mentioned that the categorization, naming convention, and description provided with each technique are sufficient to model any given attack from 2G to 4G. Two participants noted that Bhadra lacks techniques used for attacks on Operating Support System (OSS). Such techniques are either not well-documented or cover the human and operations side of mobile networks, arguably falling beyond the scope of Bhadra and requiring further research. A critical feedback received was to include taxonomy for modeling 5G threats and attacks, as threats from some protocols (e.g., HTTP/2) and technologies (e.g., cloud infrastructure and virtualization) introduced in 5G cannot be modeled yet with Bhadra. We strongly urge the inclusion of 5G taxonomy in future iterations of Bhadra.

**Usability (of the tool):**
From our observations, all participants could easily use the tool’s basic functionality and perform the threat modeling task without further assistance. However, some participants had difficulties using additional functions such as viewing comments or creating a new attack model from an existing one. We intend to address these issues by including clearer instructions and making the buttons intuitively reflect their functionality. While all participants were satisfied with the existing functions, some expressed wishes for more features. One suggestion was to highlight techniques from external (non-mobile) networks to warn operators to defend them with utmost priority. Another suggestion was to link some techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework to help business partners new to the mobile network environment (e.g., cloud service providers in 5G) better understand the context of Bhadra.

### 3.2 Potential Use Cases
In the second part of the study, we explored the potential use cases of Bhadra other than threat modeling. We summarize their responses into three themes:

**Mitigation and Prevention:**
Participants from product security teams stated that they would use the framework to explore different attack scenarios, thus developing more complete test cases to improve attack mitigation and prevention. However, we must expand the framework in the future to include sub-techniques that link to specific vulnerabilities to provide actionable insights.

**Detection and Investigation:**
Participants from the incident response team expressed that the framework could accelerate their investigation and response time if real-time events can be mapped to the framework and generate alerts based on observed attack patterns. Moreover, with such event mapping, the security team can quickly identify new observed attack patterns and uncover, for example, misconfigurations or issues in the networks and products.

**Communicating Security Audit Reports:**
All participants strongly believe that Bhadra provides a common structure and understanding when sharing information about threats, attacks, and the state of security of the networked system. The high-level overview provided by Bhadra is helpful in reducing the complexity of highly technical security incident reports and in communicating with different types of audiences. For example, participants who work as security consultants highlighted that Bhadra could help with risk assessment and security audits for their customers. According to them, Bhadra provides a complete picture of the network’s security in a simple and meaningful way, which helps them convey the audit result to higher management and customers (i.e., non-technical/business audience).

## 4. Summary and Next Steps
Discussions about threats and security incidents in mobile communication have mostly remained within closed circles of operators. However, the intervention of new technologies and players demands openness and transparency. In this regard, the simplicity that Bhadra offers in threat intelligence sharing can be helpful. Moreover, as we learned from our study, Bhadra and our tool are adoptable and usable within daily work, such as assessing the maturity of mitigation solutions, improving detection techniques, and efficiently communicating the results of security audits.

Although our participants are satisfied with Bhadra, they believe expanding the attack surface coverage, especially for 5G technologies, would be a crucial next step. While a few good resources are available (e.g., ENISA’s 5G Threat Landscape Report [2]), organizing them similar to Bhadra’s matrix demands substantial work because it requires a careful investigation of threats from newer technologies such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) [1]. This is achievable mainly if the mobile communication community embraces open conversations about threats and security under a common framework. We hope Bhadra and our tool provide the foundation for such a community-driven initiative, both in terms of taxonomy and infrastructure.
