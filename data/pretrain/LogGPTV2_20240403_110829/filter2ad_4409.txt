ABSTRACT
As the attack surface and the number of security incidents in mo-
bile communication networks increase, a common language for
threat intelligence gathering and sharing among different parties
becomes essential. We addressed this by developing the Bhadra
framework [4], a domain-specific conceptual framework that cap-
tures adversarial behaviors in end-to-end communication over the
mobile networks in our previous work. Nevertheless, the acceptance
or adoptability of the framework by the mobile communications
industry is still unclear. In this work, we built a threat modeling
tool as a companion for Bhadra and conduct a user study with
industry experts to evaluate the framework’s usefulness and ex-
plore its potential use cases besides threat modeling and sharing.
Our preliminary results indicate that the mobile communication
industry would benefit from a threat modeling framework with a
companion tool and its use cases, making it a potential candidate
to integrate within work processes.

1 MOTIVATION AND RELATED WORK
With the advent of IP-based stacks and new private players, the
attack surface of mobile communication systems has drastically in-
creased in recent years. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a common
framework to study and understand its security implications. We
filled this gap in our prior work by developing the Bhadra frame-
work [4], a conceptual threat modeling framework that provides
taxonomy for describing adversarial behaviors in end-to-end mo-
bile communication in a structured way. Bhadra takes inspiration

from the MITRE ATT&CK framework1 for its design philosophy
by providing a taxonomy matrix that describes adversarial behav-
iors in tactics and techniques. While Bhadra shares similar and
common tactical objectives as the ATT&CK framework, we found
many techniques that are unique for the network environment and
protocols used only in mobile communication systems. For more
details about Bhadra, refer to Figure 1 and the original paper [4].
Figure 1: Bhadra Threat Modeling Framework
As a concrete framework, Bhadra can provide the common lan-
guage for threat intelligence gathering and sharing among different
parties. Nevertheless, there is still scope for improvement. The
mobile communications industry has neither a conceptual frame-
work nor a clear picture of how threat modeling activities have
been done in the past. Hence, we take that as an opportunity in
this work to explore the acceptance and adoptability of the Bhadra
framework by conducting a user study with experts in the mobile
communications industry. Our contributions are as follows:
• To make the Bhadra framework more accessible and easier
to use, we developed a web tool that supports the threat and
attack modeling process with the framework.
• Secondly, we used the tool and conducted a user study with
11 participants. In this study, we explored actual use cases of
the framework with the participants to evaluate the usabil-
ity of the tool, the adoptability of the framework in terms
of attack surface coverage and possible integration of the
framework and the tool to their daily work. We also gained
insight on the clarity of the framework, e.g., whether its
taxonomy is understandable by its users.

We observed that many popular threat modeling frameworks are
tightly coupled with their own supporting tools, such as the MITRE
ATT&CK Navigator2 for using the ATT&CK matrices and Microsoft
Threat Modeling tool 3 for using the STRIDE framework. This trend
encouraged us to build a companion tool, built specifically with
an emphasis on its usability and future needs, is needed as the
first step in Bhadra’s adoption. This section presents the design
considerations and functionality of the tool we built.
view the attack patterns by filtering relevant attacks based on tech-
niques used. We use color coding to visualize the frequency of each
technique being selected, thus enabling the users to easily observe
the attack patterns and identify the bottleneck and what impact
each technique can lead to. An example is shown in Figure 2.
2.1 Design Considerations
Since Bhadra takes its inspiration for the design philosophy from the
MITRE ATT&CK, it is obvious to seek inspiration for the tool from
the ATT&CK Navigator. Given that the Navigator is open-sourced
and widely adopted, our initial attempt was to reuse and repurpose
its code to serve as a companion tool for Bhadra. However, after a
careful evaluation of the requirements and long-term development
plans of Bhadra, we decided to build our tool from scratch.
First, we found that ATT&CK Navigator is too complex for first-
time users, whereas Bhadra needs a simple tool with minimal fea-
tures that is easy and intuitive to use. The reason is that the mobile
communications industry (i.e., users of Bhadra) is not doing threat
modeling as a common security practice, and a complex tool would
discourage them from using Bhadra regularly. Secondly, Navigator
heavily benefits from the ATT&CK threat intelligence knowledge
base that provides, for example, details, concrete examples, and
mitigation. Given that the Bhadra framework is still in its infancy,
it lacks such a backend knowledge base. Hence, we decided to build
the infrastructure to host a threat intelligence knowledge base in
the future. Based on the aforementioned design considerations,
we built our tool to support the following components: (a) Fron-
tend: a simple user interface to support only required features that
Bhadra needs at this point, b) Backend: a backend server for eas-
ier management and collaboration on the knowledge base, and c)
Extendable APIs: to provide APIs such that our tool can be easily
extended to support more features in the future.
It is important to note that while we provide APIs and skeletal
structure for the knowledge base only with sample content, more
concrete information is yet to be populated. This is only possible
if the mobile communications security community can actively
participate and contribute.
2.2 Functional Components
The Bhadra threat modeling tool contains three main functional
components: a knowledge base for threat intelligence sharing, an
annotator for modeling, and a pattern analyzer for analyzing attack
patterns from the modeled attacks. The Knowledge Base currently
includes the description of a technique with related examples of
attacks or vulnerabilities, mitigation and detection methods, and
references. The Annotator supports the necessary functions for
modeling threats or attacks: to mark related techniques, add com-
ments to the techniques, and create, read, update, and delete a model
and its metadata. The Pattern Analyzer helps security analysts to

3 USER STUDY
We aimed to understand the adoptability and acceptance of using
Bhadra framework and the tool we built for threat modeling in the
mobile communications industry through a user study. Our target
participants are those who need to perform and present security
analysis on a daily basis. We recruited our participants (n=11) from
different teams across Nokia Corporation, one of the leading mobile
network companies. Each participant was carefully chosen such
that the study result represent feedbacks from a variety of roles
(e.g., system architect, radio engineer, security consultant) and the
participants have knowledge of different aspects of mobile network.
We scheduled a one-hour interview with the participants to observe
their behavior while modeling with the tool and facilitate an open
discussion about the acceptance and use cases of the framework.
Our user study consists of two parts. The first part is designed
to understand if the users can form a common understanding of
Bhadra, e.g., from the name and description of the techniques. All
participants were given an attack scenario of IMSI Catcher [3]. We
asked the participants to read through the technique description in
our tool and select the ones used in the attack. During the process,
we probed questions such as “Does the name of the technique con-
vey the same idea as the description?”, “Is the description clear?” to
understand the perceived technique clarity. We looked specifically
for any conflicting perceptions about the framework between the
participants. Also, as a crude way to evaluate the usability of our
tool, we observed the participants’ behavior and asked for their
feedback on the ease of using and navigating the tool. In the second
part, we explored potential use cases of the framework and the
tool together with the participants to understand the adoptabil-
ity of threat modeling in their everyday work and to identify any
improvement needed for the adoption.

Firstly, we tried to understand whether Bhadra and our tool can
be adopted easily for threat modeling. It turns out that the partici-
pants were interested in adopting them to their daily work routines.
Analysis of the user responses revealed the following three themes
of user perspectives. We use them for evaluating the adoptability.
Clarity: The participants stated that the names of the techniques
are self-explanatory, and their rationale is clear from the description
and examples. However, there was some confusion while choosing
similar or repeated techniques within more than one tactic. From
our discussion with the participants, we learned that such confusion
arises from a lack of prior threat modeling experience.
Coverage: Bhadra currently covers attack vectors from 2G to 4G,
but not 5G. Most participants were satisfied with the coverage
of Bhadra that the taxonomy is systematically categorized, and
they find no missing techniques. They also mentioned that catego-
rization, naming convention, and description provided with each
technique are sufficient to model any given attack from 2G to 4G.
Two participants noticed that Bhadra lacks techniques used for
attacks on Operating Support System (OSS). Such techniques are
either not well-documented or cover the human and operations
side of mobile networks. Arguably, they fall much beyond the scope
of Bhadra and perhaps need further research to come up with an
entirely new set of taxonomy. One critical feedback received on
coverage was to include taxonomy for modeling 5G threats and
attacks. For example, threats from some protocols (e.g., HTTP/2)
and technologies (e.g., cloud infrastructure and virtualization) in-
troduced in 5G cannot be modeled yet with Bhadra. We strongly
urge to include 5G taxonomy in the future iterations of Bhadra.
Usability (of the tool): From our observation, all participants could
easily use the tool’s basic functionality and perform the threat mod-
eling task without any further assistance. However, we noticed that
some participants had difficulties using additional functions such as
viewing comments or creating a new attack model from an existing
one. We intend to fix them soon by including clearer instructions
and making the buttons intuitively reflect their functionality. While
all participants were satisfied with the existing functions, some
participants expressed their wishes for more features. One of them
was highlighting techniques from external (non-mobile) networks
to warn the operators to defend it with utmost priority. The other
suggestion was to link some techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK
framework to helps business partners who are new to the mobile
network environment (e.g., cloud service providers in 5G) to under-
stand better the context of Bhadra.
3.2 Potential Use Cases
In this part of the study, we explored the potential use cases of
Bhadra other than threat modeling with the study participants. We
summarize their response into three themes as follows:
Mitigation and Prevention: Participants from product security
teams stated that they would use the framework to explore dif-
ferent attack scenarios, thus developing more complete test cases
to improve attack mitigation and prevention. However, we must
expand the framework in the future to include sub-techniques that
link to specific vulnerabilities to provide actionable insights.
Detection and Investigation: Participants from the incidence
response team expressed that the framework could accelerate their
investigation and response time if real-time events can be mapped
to the framework and generate alerts based on observed attack
patterns. Moreover, with such event mapping, the security team
can quickly identify new observed attack patterns and uncover, e.g.,
misconfigurations or issues in the networks and products.
Communicating security audit reports: All the participants
strongly believe that Bhadra provides a common structure and
understanding when sharing information about threats, attacks,
and the state of security of the networked system. The high-level
overview provided by Bhadra is helpful to reduce the complexity
of highly technical security incident reports and to communicate
with different types of audiences. For example, the participants
who work as security consultants highlighted that Bhadra could
help with risk assessment and security audits for their customers.
According to them, Bhadra provides a complete picture of the net-
work’s security in a simple and meaningful way, which helps them
convey the audit result to higher management and customers (i.e.,
non-technical/ business audience).
4 SUMMARY AND NEXT STEPS
Discussions about threats and security incidents in mobile commu-
nication have mostly remained within closed circles of operators.
Nevertheless, the intervention of new technologies and players
demands openness and transparency. In this regard, the simplic-
ity that Bhadra offers in threat intelligence sharing can be helpful.
Moreover, as we learned from our study, Bhadra and our tool are
adoptable and usable within their daily works, such as assessing the
maturity of mitigation solutions, improving detection techniques,
and efficiently communicating the results of security audits.
Although our participants are satisfied with Bhadra, they believe
expanding the attack surface coverage, especially for 5G technolo-
gies, would be a crucial next step. While a few good resources are
available (e.g., ENISA’s 5G Threat Landscape Report [2]), organizing
them similar to Bhadra’s matrix demands substantial work because
it requires careful investigation of threats from newer technolo-
gies such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-
Defined Networking (SDN) [1]. This is achievable mainly if the
mobile communication community embraces open conversations
about threats and security under a common framework. We hope
Bhadra and our tool provide the foundation for such a community-
driven initiative, both in terms of taxonomy and infrastructure.
