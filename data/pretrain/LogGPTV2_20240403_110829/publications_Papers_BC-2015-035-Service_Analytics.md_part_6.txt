# Service Analytics

## Introduction
Analytics involves mining data contained in unstructured, natural language text to discover new knowledge and make informed decisions to solve problems. Through an iterative approach, organizations can use text analytics to gain insights into content-specific values such as sentiment, emotion, relevance, and intensity.

### Definition: Text Mining
Text mining is a process by which software applications extract specific, high-quality information from large amounts of text, usually by recognizing specific terms.

## Text Mining Methods
Text mining methods are typically grouped into two main categories: text analysis and document retrieval.

- **Document Retrieval**: This involves finding the most relevant documents from a large corpus of text based on a specified query. Prominent examples include web search and retrieval in library catalogs.
- **Example**: By analyzing incident reports submitted to an IT service provider as a corpus of textual documents, text retrieval becomes useful when a technician searches with a particular query, e.g., incidents related to printers. The most relevant reports to that query are then returned as results.

Software that provides text analytics typically transposes words and phrases from the unstructured data representation into numerical values, which can then be analyzed using traditional mining techniques. Important tasks usually performed include document topic detection, text categorization, document clustering, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.

## Tools and Software
The following is a list of tools and software that contain a variety of analytics and machine learning algorithms:

- **R and RStudio**: A software environment for statistical computing and data mining. It supports a wide variety of data mining and statistical algorithms, including classification, time series analysis, clustering, and linear and non-linear modeling.
- **SPSS**: A user-friendly software package suitable for beginners. It has a “point and click” user interface with commands available via drop-down menus. It performs most general statistical analyses (regression, logistic regression, survival analysis, analysis of variance, factor analysis, and multivariate analysis).
- **SAS**: Targets power users who can use the application programmability. Users typically write SAS programs to manipulate data and perform data analyses. It also provides general statistical analyses.
- **Mahout**: A scalable machine learning and data mining library suitable for Big Data processing. It supports various algorithms such as classification, regression, and recommendation.
- **MALLET**: A Java-based machine learning package for document classification, topic modeling, information extraction, and sequence labeling applications.
- **Weka**: An open-source machine learning software library in Java that includes pre-processing, regression, classification, clustering, and association rules. Figure 6.8 illustrates the visualization of a decision tree generated in Weka.
- **GraphLab**: A scalable and distributed machine learning library that supports graph-based machine learning algorithms.
- **Encog**: An advanced machine learning framework that supports a variety of advanced algorithms, as well as methods to normalize and process data. It is available in Java, C++, and .NET.
- **RapidMiner**: An open-source machine learning tool in Java that supports a wide range of machine learning algorithms.
- **d3js**: Chord diagrams for visualization based on the D3.js JavaScript library.
- **Gephi**: An open-source software for visualizing and analyzing network graphs.
- **Tableau**: A commercial software used for data visualization, suitable for improving the process of finding patterns in data.

Other common tools include Microsoft Excel for processing raw datasets and exploring processed data. Excel is especially helpful for implementing basic and intermediate mathematical functions.

## Conclusions
The large volumes of data available today, generated from service operations, hold implicit information that can be translated into useful knowledge for making intelligent business decisions. IT service provisioning is often managed by sophisticated information systems that monitor and log all activities needed to deliver services with agreed service levels.

Service analytics provides enterprises with powerful mechanisms to convert these logs into consistent datasets for analysis. Extracted insights are important to understand all aspects of service operations to take actions to improve organizational performance and increase customer satisfaction. Service provisioning can be studied to identify human behavior in service-intensive organizations at the individual, workgroup, and organizational levels. Delivery can identify how staff, information systems, and customers arrange themselves to co-create services. Finally, consumption looks into the role of time and place in service delivery.

Existing algorithms from the field of data mining, such as classification, association rules, regression, and clustering, can be used with little adaptation and effort. In many situations, new algorithms must be developed when specific insights need to be extracted.

## Review Section
### Review Questions
1. Briefly describe the main characteristics that distinguish service analytics from the general data analytics paradigm.
2. This chapter defines three levels under which service analytics methods fall based on the action performed with the discovered knowledge. Briefly describe these levels and give examples of analytics methods that fall under each of them.
3. What are the differences between classification and prediction methods?
4. What is cluster analysis? What is a cluster? List the main differences between partitioning methods and hierarchical methods for cluster analysis. Give examples in each method. Describe a scenario in which the application of clustering to service systems.
5. Describe the characteristics of the regression method. Define a scenario in which regression can be applied to service systems. How is regression different from cluster analysis?
6. Describe the main types of text mining methods relevant for services. Give one example for each of the following cases: (a) an application that uses document categorization techniques on the data generated by the consumption of a particular service and (b) an application that uses sentiment analysis methods on the data generated by the consumption of a particular service.

### Project
#### Clustering
Consider the dataset from Figure 6.12 as a graphical representation of IT service incidents (i.e., each point represents an incident). The company needs to cluster incidents by applying the k-means method in this dataset for the first 6 iterations. The circles are data points, and the initial centroids are given as black rectangles. The separating lines show the clusters' boundaries in the first iteration.

(a) How do the centroids and boundaries look like in the following iterations? Does the method terminate?

**Hint**: This is a quality sketch to demonstrate the main principle of clustering.

(b) Show graphically an example that applies the k-means algorithm, which for different initializations gives different results.

#### Decision Tree
Figure 6.13 describes the results of a marketing campaign for a real-estate service. It contains information for each potential client regarding the residential area where they live, the type of household, their earnings, and whether they were a former client of the company. Use this data to predict whether a person is going to react positively (i.e., send a reply) to an advertisement of the service. Build a decision tree to make this prediction.

| Residential Area | House Type | Earnings | Former Client | Result |
|------------------|------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Suburb           | Single-family House | High | No | No Reply |
| Suburb           | Single-family House | High | No | No Reply |
| Suburb           | Townhouse | High | No | No Reply |
| Suburb           | Semi-detached House | Low | No | Replied |
| Suburb           | Townhouse | Low | Yes | Replied |
| Suburb           | Townhouse | High | Yes | No Reply |
| City             | Semi-detached House | Low | Yes | No Reply |
| City             | Townhouse | High | Yes | No Reply |

| Village          | Single-family House | Low | No | Replied |
| Village          | Single-family House | High | No | Replied |
| Village          | Townhouse | Low | No | Replied |
