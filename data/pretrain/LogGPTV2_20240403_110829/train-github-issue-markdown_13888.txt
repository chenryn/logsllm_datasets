**Current behavior**  
docs: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/i18n.html  
show only how to work with template via  
`foo`
would like the recommended way to work with strings when eval in code:
`var foo = 'Hello world' `
**Expected behavior**  
so maybe  
`var foo = 'Hello world' ` ?
  * **Language:** [all | TypeScript X.X | ES6/7 | ES5]
