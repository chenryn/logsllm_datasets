### Current Behavior
The current documentation at [Angular i18n Cookbook](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/i18n.html) only provides examples of how to handle internationalization (i18n) in templates using:
```typescript
foo
```
However, there is no guidance on the recommended approach for handling strings that are evaluated in code, such as:
```typescript
var foo = 'Hello world';
```

### Expected Behavior
It would be helpful if the documentation could provide a recommended way to handle string localization in code, similar to:
```typescript
var foo = 'Hello world';
```

### Additional Information
- **Language:** All
- **Angular Version:** Angular 2
