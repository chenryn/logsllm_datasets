Over the past few days, I have been attempting to install the Native Client SDK for Chrome on both Windows and Ubuntu. However, I am behind a corporate network, and my only internet access is through an HTTP proxy that requires authentication.

When I run `naclsdk update` in Ubuntu, I encounter the following error:
```
urlopen error Tunnel connection failed: 407 Proxy Authentication Required
```

I found a workaround, though it's not a direct solution. I managed to redirect the HTTPS traffic through the HTTP proxy using a program called "Proxifier." This approach has worked well for me.
