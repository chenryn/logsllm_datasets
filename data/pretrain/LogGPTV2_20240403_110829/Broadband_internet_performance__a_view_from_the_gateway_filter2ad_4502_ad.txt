### Characterizing Burst Rates and Steady-State Throughput Rates

Do different users experience varying PowerBoost effects? Using BISMark, we conducted an in-depth study of Comcast’s implementation of PowerBoost. According to Comcast [9], their PowerBoost technology provides higher throughput for the first 10 MB of a download and the first 5 MB of an upload.

**Figure 10: PowerBoost Behavior for Four Users**
- **(a) Download Profiles:**
  - D-LINK modem: Peak rate of about 21 Mbps for 3 seconds, 18.5 Mbps for the next 10 seconds, and a steady-state rate of 12.5 Mbps.
  - Motorola modem: Peak rate of 21 Mbps for about 8 seconds.
  - PowerBoost technology [10] uses token buckets for both packet and data rates, allowing for dynamic bucket sizes.
  - The D-LINK profile can be modeled as a cascaded filter with rates of 18.5 Mbps and 12.5 Mbps, and buffer sizes of 10 MB and 1 MB, respectively, with a line capacity of 21 Mbps.

- **(b) Upload Profiles:**
  - D-LINK user: 7 Mbps for 8 seconds.
  - Scientific Atlanta and Thomson users: 4 Mbps for 20 seconds.
  - Motorola user: 3.5 Mbps for nearly 35 seconds.
  - Our results indicate that Comcast does not currently apply buckets based on packet rates, as the results do not vary with packet size.

**Key Insight:**
- Depending on how throughput measurements are conducted and their duration, the results across users may vary considerably. Specifically, any speed test lasting less than 35 seconds may only capture the effects of PowerBoost in some cases, leading to potential bias in short-term throughput measurements.

### Understanding Latency

We explore how latency can significantly affect performance, even on ISP service plans with high throughput. We then examine how various factors, including the user’s modem and ISP traffic shaping policies, can influence latency.

#### 6.1 How (and Why) to Measure Latency

Latency impacts the performance experienced by users, affecting not only throughput but also perceived performance. High latency can slow down operations such as DNS resolution and content rendering.

**Metrics for Access Networks:**
- **Last-Mile Latency:** The latency to the first hop inside the ISP’s network, capturing the access link's performance.
- **Latency Under Load:** The latency experienced during uploads or downloads when the link is saturated.

**Figure 11: Effect of Downstream Throughput and Baseline Latency on Fetch Time from Facebook.com**
- **(a) Fetch Time Stabilization:**
  - Download times decrease as throughput increases, with negligible improvement beyond 6 Mbps.
- **(b) Impact of Latency:**
  - Minimum download times increase by about 50% when baseline latencies increase from 10 ms to 40 ms, highlighting the importance of baseline latency.

**Table 4: Last-Mile Latency and Loss Variation**
- **ISP | Last Mile Latency (ms) | Loss (%)**
  - AT&T: 25.23 ms | 0.48%
  - Comcast: 10.36 ms | 0.27%
  - TimeWarner: 11.87 ms | 0.33%
  - Verizon: 12.41 ms | 0.51%
  - Charter: 11.87 ms | 0.43%
  - Cox: 13.88 ms | 1.11%
  - Qwest: 39.42 ms | 0.33%
  - Cablevision: 10.21 ms | 0.33%

**Table 5: Jitter Variation**
- **ISP | Downstream Jitter (ms) | Upstream Jitter (ms)**
  - AT&T: 1.85 ms | 7.63 ms
  - Comcast: 1.68 ms | 6.37 ms
  - TimeWarner: 1.71 ms | 3.35 ms
  - Verizon: 1.17 ms | 5.01 ms
  - Charter: 1.18 ms | 1.66 ms
  - Cox: 3.04 ms | 1.89 ms
  - Qwest: 12.59 ms | 12.52 ms
  - Cablevision: 1.69 ms | 3.52 ms

#### 6.2 Last-Mile Latency

We measure last-mile latency by running traceroute to a wide-area destination and extracting the first IP address along the path that is not a NAT address. This measures the latency to the first network-layer hop, which may not always be the DSLAM or CMTS.

**Figure 12: Baseline Last-Mile Latency Distribution**
- Most users see latencies less than 10 ms, but a significant number have latencies greater than 10 ms. (Source: SamKnows)

**Key Insight:**
- Cable providers generally have lower last-mile latency and jitter. DSL users may experience significantly higher baseline latencies based on physical factors such as distance to the DSLAM or line quality.

#### 6.3 Latency Under Load

We investigate the problem of excessive buffering under load conditions, which affects most ISPs and the equipment they provide. We profile different modems to understand how this issue affects them and explore the impact of ISP policies such as active queue and buffer management.

**Problem: Oversized Buffers**
- Buffers on DSL and cable modems are often too large, leading to substantial delays during periods of high load. The uplink capacity also affects latency introduced by buffering.

**Figure 13: Latency Under Load vs. Baseline Latency**
- The histogram shows that oversized buffers affect users across all ISPs, though the intensity varies. The increase in latency when the uplink is saturated is much higher than when the downlink is saturated.

**Key Insight:**
- Oversized buffers are a widespread problem, and their impact on latency is more pronounced on the uplink compared to the downlink.
