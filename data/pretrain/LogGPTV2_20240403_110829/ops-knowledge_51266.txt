User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can't resolve issue: iptables: No chain/target/match by that name So I am trying to setup shorewall firewall on my linux vps. The vps is running ubuntu 12.10. When I type $ shorewall check I get this error.

iptables: No chain/target/match by that name.
   ERROR: Log level INFO requires LOG Target in your kernel and iptables


So I run iptables -L and I get

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination


I tried looking at other posts and there is one similar, but it did not help me. The kernel I am using is 2.6.32-042stab079.5

Does anyone know what I need to do to fix this? I've seen a few things about changing the kernel config, but I have no idea how to do that or what to change.

Assistant: You're using an OpenVZ based VPS. As with all container-based virtualization, you are limited to the kernel modules provided by the host.

Your options are:


Contact the host and request that they make the necessary kernel modules available to you.
Use a VPS not based on containers but on full virtualization or paravirtualization, such as Xen, KVM or VMware.
