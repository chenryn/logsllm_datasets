User: I am currently in a course that is using OpenGL and I have been using C for all the programs so far. I have Python installed on Fedora as well as OpenGL, however the minute I call an OpenGL command in my Python code, I get a segmentation fault. I have no idea why this is.
Just to avoid the "just use C" comments, here is why I want to use Python:
There are a couple reasons I am wanting to switch from C to Python, but the main one is because we are about to start writing a raytracer and I would like to use classes to make it easier on me. Since I hate classes in C++ and structs in C seems a little crazy, I thought I would give Python a try at it. I have also been looking for a reason to use Python again as it has been a while.
Thanks for any help.
Assistant: We have neither ideas about random segmentation faults. There is not enough information. What python libraries are you using for opengl? How do you use them? Can you show us your code? It's probably something trivial but my god -skill ends up to telling me just and only that.
Raytracer in python? I'd prefer just doing that in C with those structs. But then, I'm assuming you aren't going to do a realtime raytracer so that may be ok.
