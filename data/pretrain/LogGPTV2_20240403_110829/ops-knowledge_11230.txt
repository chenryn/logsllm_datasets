User: Not the source codes, thats the only thing i seem to find. I can't install py2.6 because it would overtake 2.5 and cause mayor mess in my pc.
Assistant: How would it overtake 2.5? You can install both in parallel, just make sure that you unselect the option to "Register Extensions" during the install of 2.6.
I have several Python installations on my PC in parallel, one of them my "standard" one that I expect to run when I doubleclick on a .py file, and the other one to invoke manually if I need it.
I have found, though, that sometimes file associations are lost completely after installing a new version without the "Register Extensions" option set. In that case just run a "repair installation" with your preferred standard version, and you should be good to go.
