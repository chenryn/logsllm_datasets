Question: As a server application developer, you're tasked with creating a named service port using the 'port_create()' method. Your protocol requires the client to send multiple messages before expecting a reply. What is the minimum number of receive buffers ('num_recv_bufs') you should specify when creating the port to accommodate this protocol?
"A": "Zero, since the messages will be processed one at a time synchronously.",
"B": "One, as it allows for a send and receive buffer which is sufficient for any protocol.",
"C": "At least two, to handle more than one message before a reply can appear.",
"D": "The maximum allowed by the system to ensure that no messages are dropped."
Answer: C
