**ATT&CK ID:** T1430.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote Device Management Services

An adversary may exploit access to cloud services, such as Google's Android Device Manager or Apple iCloud's Find My iPhone, or gain entry into an enterprise mobility management (EMM) or mobile device management (MDM) server console to track the location of mobile devices managed by these services. This technique allows the attacker to monitor and potentially control the physical location of targeted devices, posing significant security and privacy risks.
