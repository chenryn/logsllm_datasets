User: I need to test whether several .py scripts (all part of a much bigger program) work after updating python. The only thing I have is their path. Is there any intelligent way how to find out from which other scripts are these called? Brute-forece grepping wasn't as good aas I expected.
Assistant: I combined two things:

ran automated tests with the old and new version of pythona nd compared results
used snakefood to track the dependencies and ran the parent scripts

Thanks for the os.walk and os.getppid suggestion, however, I didn't want to write/use any additional code.
