Certainly! Here is a more polished and coherent version of your text:

I need to test whether several `.py` scripts, which are part of a larger program, still work after updating Python. I only have the paths to these scripts. Is there an intelligent way to determine which other scripts call these specific ones? A brute-force approach using `grep` was not as effective as I had hoped.

To address this, I combined two methods:

1. **Automated Testing**: I ran automated tests with both the old and new versions of Python and compared the results.
2. **Dependency Tracking**: I used the `snakefood` tool to track the dependencies and then executed the parent scripts.

Thank you for the suggestions regarding `os.walk` and `os.getppid`. However, I preferred not to write or use any additional code.

This version is clearer, more professional, and better organized.
