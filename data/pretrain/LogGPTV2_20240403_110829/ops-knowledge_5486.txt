User: Hey :)  I'm working on a Mac with Mountain Lion, and installed both Ruby 1.9.3 and Python 2.7.3 from homebrew.  However, which python and which ruby return that they are in /usr/local/bin/__, respectively.  I would like them to read from /usr/local/Cellar/python or /usr/local/Cellar/ruby.  How do I change their paths?
Assistant: I don't know on mac but on linux they're set up as links to /usr/local/bin/*
If you wanted to change the symbolic link you could run the command
ln -s /user/local/Celler/python /usr/local/bin/python which would make a new symbolic link.
Whether this works on OSX I can't confirm though.
Another method you might want to try is just calling the homebrew versions directly rather than making everything on your system use them. Or just making a symbolic link to something else such as ln -s /user/local/Celler/python /usr/local/bin/pythonH
