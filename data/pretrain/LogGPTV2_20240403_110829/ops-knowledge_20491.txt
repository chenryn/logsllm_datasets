User: Server logs are an important basis for troubleshooting problems in distributed systems. Please introduce how to troubleshoot common problems (such as performance problems, failure problems, and security problems) through logs. At the same time, how do we monitor and warn through logs?
Assistant: Troubleshoot common problems through logs: 1. Performance problems: By locating request logs with long response times and high number of requests, you can further analyze the specific response phase and response time distribution, and find modules and codes that need to be optimized. 2. Fault problem: When a fault occurs, the log should be recorded in time, including error information, exception stack, and related information that caused the problem. By analyzing the log, the cause and source of the fault can be determined. 3. Security issues: through the monitoring of access logs, record abnormal access, such as access time, visitor IP, accessed URL and other information, and then use security log analysis tools to analyze these logs to determine the source of security threats type. Monitoring and early warning through logs: 1. Monitoring: Through real-time monitoring of logs, abnormalities in the system can be found in time, such as a sudden increase in the number of requests and continuous occurrence of error logs. 2. Early warning: According to the experience of past logs, corresponding alarm rules can be formulated, and when corresponding abnormal situations appear in the logs, the alarm can be reported in time. If there are abnormal requests in the access log, you should call the police in time. For log monitoring and early warning, some log analysis tools are usually used for processing, such as Rizhiyi, Splunk, etc. These tools can quickly process, analyze and visualize a large amount of log data.
