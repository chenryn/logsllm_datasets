A Review on Internet of Things (Iot): Security and Privacy Requirements and the Solution Approaches
Infrastructures  (PKIs),  as  well  as  some  distributed 
approaches,  e.g.,  pairwise  symmetric  key  exchange 
schemes, cannot scale with the IoT.  
Constrained  Resources:  Things  in  the  IoT  will  have 
constraints  that  need  to  be  considered  for  security 
mechanisms.  This  includes  energy  limitations,  e.g., 
battery  powered  devices,  as  well  as  low  computation 
power,  e.g.,  micro  sensors.  Thus,  heavy  computational 
cryptographic algorithms cannot be applied to all things. 
IoT  and  traditional  network  security  issues  are  different 
in  many  ways.  IoT  is  composed  of  RFID  nodes  and 
WSN  nodes,  whose  resources  are  limited,  while  the 
Internet  is  composed  of  PC,  severs,  smart  phones 
whose  resources  are  rich.  In  the  Internet,  we  use 
combinations  of  complex  algorithms  and  lightweight 
algorithms to maximize security with less considerations 
of resource usage such as computation power. While in 
IoT,  most  of  the  cases,  we  can  only  use  lightweight 
algorithms  to  find  the  balance  between  security  and 
power  consumptions.  Connection  between  IoT  nodes 
are always through slower, less secure wireless media, 
which  results 
leakage,  easily  node 
compromising and all other insecure issues. Whereas in 
Internet, most communications are through faster, more 
secure  wire  or  wireless  communications.  Even  with  the 
Mobile Internet, wireless connections are built on top of 
complex secure protocols which are almost impossible 
to implement for resource limited IoT nodes.  
in  easy  data 
in 
Although 
there  are  various  devices 
the 
Internet,  but  with  the  abstraction  of  operating  system, 
their  data  formats  are  almost  the  same  with  Window 
Family and Unix-like operating systems. However, in IoT, 
what  we  have  is  just  bare  wireless  node.  There  is  no 
operating system, just a simple embedded program for 
the  chip.  With  the  diversity  of  nodes  perception  goal, 
there  comes  different  chip  hardware  which  result  in 
heterogeneous  data  contents  and  data  formats.  There 
are all kinds of IoT applications in application layer, used 
in  our  everyday  life;  they  gather  our  private  information 
every  second  automatically  to  make  our  life  easier. 
These  applications  can  even  control  our  everyday  life 
environment.  It  would  be  of  great  potential  security 
problems  if  we  lose  control  of  IoT  system.  While  in  the 
Internet, if we do not provide our information ourselves, 
there is no way for attackers to get our information. And 
with the help of operating system and plenty of security 
software, the environment is more secure.  
So  in  one  word,  IoT  system  lives  in  a  more 
dangerous environment with limited resources and less 
network  guards.  So  we  need  to  implement  lightweight 
solutions to deal with this more dangerous environment.

Internet of Things Layers 
In order to analyze the security issues of IoT in 
more detail, IoT layers are divided into perception layer, 
transportation  layer  and  application  layer.  Perception 
layer  can  further  be  divided  into  perception  nodes  and

c)  LOT Security and Privacy Requirements  
controller.  Perception 
Security  and  privacy  are  crucial  enabling 
technologies and thus among the biggest challenges for 
the  IoT  [31].  Therefore,  it  is  compelling  for  the  IoT 
architectures  to  consider  and  resolve  these  challenges 
upfront.  Otherwise,  applications  as  well  as  whole 
ecosystems  building  on  top  of  such  architectures  may 
repeat  the  security  fallacies  of  the  past  decades.  For 
that, a precise understanding of security requirements in 
the context of the IoT is indispensable. 
Prior  technology  trends,  e.g.,  cloud  computing 
and  big  data,  are  likely  to  share  security  requirements 
with  the  IoT.  However,  the  uniqueness  of  the  IoT 
introduces  new  challenges  to  security  requirements, 
different  from  previous  technology  trends.  Big  data 
solutions  for  instance  are  designed  to  scale  and  deal 
with  heterogeneity  of  data  sources.  Nevertheless,  big 
data  solutions  are  not  required 
to  deal  with  an 
uncontrolled  environment  and  constrained  resources; 
big  data  analytics  run  in  isolated  silos  with  time  or 
resources  to  spare.  Likewise,  cloud  computing  by

design is supposed to scale and overcome challenges 
of  constrained  resources.  However,  cloud  computing 
hardly  deals  with  mobility  of  devices  and  physical 
accessibility of sensors. Related IoT security surveys are 
incomplete  with  respect  to  requirements.  To  provide  a 
comprehensive  overview,  we  summarize  these  security 
requirements from the domain of the IoT and split them 
into five groups: Network Security, Identity Management, 
Privacy,  Trust,  and  Resilience.  It  is  obvious  that  with 
regard  to  network  security  the  constrained  resources 
should have the strongest connection, mainly due
to the 
restrictions 
traditional  security 
mechanisms,  e.g.,  cryptography.  Moreover, 
identity 
management  is  influenced  by  the  heterogeneity  of  the 
IoT. Privacy is mostly connected with scalability and the 
constrained  resources  as  restrictions  are  posed  to  the 
technology candidates that can be utilized. Furthermore, 
the  uncontrolled  environment  and  the  heterogeneity  of 
the IoT have a serious impact on trust. Lastly, resilience 
is directly connected to the need of the IoT for scalability 
[23].
 Network  Security:
Network  security  requirements  are 
divided  into  confidentiality,  authenticity,  integrity,  and 
[34].  Factors 
availability 
like  heterogeneity  and 
constrained 
resources  must  be  considered  while 
applying these to IoT architectures. Interconnecting the 
devices 
to  have  better  confidentiality  so 
technologies  such  as  IPSec  [35]  and  Transport  Layer 
Security 
this 
requirement. There’s another dedicated secure network 
stacks  of  IoT  available  in  case  overhead  exceeds  the 
resource constraints of things [32]. Authenticity confirms 
that the connection established is with an authenticated 
entity and authenticity also includes integrity of data but 
can be required separately to detect and recover failures 
so  mechanisms  such  as  TCP  and  TLS  suffice  this 
requirement.
Privacy:
Privacy  is  considered  to  be  one  of  main 
challenges in IoT [24] due to the involvement of humans 
and  increasingly  ubiquitous  data  collection.  Privacy  of 
data  includes  confidential  data  transmission  in  a  way 
that  it  shouldn’t  expose  undesired  properties,  e.g. 
identity  of  a  person.  This  requirement  is  considered  as 
big  challenge  as  almost  every  other  sensing  device 
collect  personal  information  and  large  amount  of  such 
data  becomes  Personally  Identifiable  Information  (PII) 
when  combined  together;  enough  to  identify  a  person 
[38]. 
[33]  are  employed 
to  meet 
require 
(TLS) 
  A  single  person  not  being  identifiable  as  the 
source  of  data  or  an  action  is  anonymity,  another 
challenge to face in IoT as mobile devices and wearable 
sensors may leak PII such
as IP addresses and location 
unknowingly.  There  are  some  technologies  already 
being  employed  such  as  anonymous  credentials  and 
onion  routing,  though  may  not  scale  well  with  IoT.

ability.  With 
pseudonymity,  actions  of  a  person  are  linked  with  a 
pseudonym, a random identifier, rather than an identity 
[23].
Intel  Security  also  announced,  its  Enhanced 
Privacy  Identity  (EPID)  technology  will  be  promoted  to 
other silicon vendors. EPID has anonymity properties, in 
addition to hardware-enforced integrity, and is included 
in  ISO  and  TCG  standards.  The  EPID  technology 
provides  an  on-ramp  for  other  devices  to  securely 
connect to the Intel IoT Platform [1].
Identity Management:
A comprehensive attention should 
be  given  for  identity  management  in  IoT  due  to  the 
number  of  devices  and 
the  complex  relationship 
between  devices,  services,  owners  and  users  [38]. 
Methods 
including 
revocation,  and  accountability  or  non-repudiation  are 
required.  There  may  be  multiple  domain  scenarios  in 
IoT, authorization solutions, e.g., Kerberos [13], assume 
a  single  domain  that  encloses  devices,  owners,  users, 
and services. Therefore, new authorization solutions that 
work with un-trusted devices, allow delegation of access 
across  domains,  and  capable  of  quick  revocation  are 
needed.  Accountability  in  trust  management  ensures 
that  every  action  is  clearly  bound  to  an  authenticated 
entity, is another challenge in IoT. It must be capable to 
deal  with  huge  amounts  of  entities,  delegation  of 
access, actions that span organizational domains along 
with continuous derivation of data.
Resilience:
Resilience  and  robustness  against  attacks 
and  failures  becomes  another  important  challenge  due 
to large scale of devices. IoT architectures must provide 
mechanisms  to  proficiently  select  things,  transmission 
paths,  and  services  according  to  their  robustness 
(failure/attack  avoidance).  Also,  fail-over  and  recovery 
mechanisms  must  be  provided  to  maintain  operations 
under  failure  or  attacks,  and  to  return  to  normal 
operations [2].

Cryptographic  Primitives  Goals  and  Attack 
Techniques
message  only  disclosed 
Cryptographic  primitives  are 
in  general 
utilized  to  comply  with  the  main  security  goals  for 
exchanged messages and the system itself [3]. 
Main security requirements are
Confidentiality:
authorized entities
tempered
Integrity:
message is sent from a genuine entity
Authenticity:
Availability:
system  keeps  serving  its  purpose  and 
stays uninterruptedly available for legitimate entities
It is also important to understand the attack techni-
ques in order to rationalize security mechanisms in 
communication protocols. Some important attacks 
with respect to IoT are: Eavesdropping: process of
