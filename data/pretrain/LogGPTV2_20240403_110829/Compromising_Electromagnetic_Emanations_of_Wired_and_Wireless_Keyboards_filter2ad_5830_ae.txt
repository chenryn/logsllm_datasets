### Setup 4: The Building

In this setup, we observed some unexpected results. We were able to capture the signal and recover keystrokes with over 95% accuracy at a distance of 20 meters from the keyboard, which is the maximum distance within the building. This suggests that the environment can significantly enhance eavesdropping capabilities. For instance, metallic structures like pipes or electric wires can act as antennas, thereby increasing the eavesdropping range. In this case, the compromising emanations are carried by the shared ground of the electric line. Thus, the effective range is determined by the distance between the keyboard and the shared ground, and the distance between the shared ground and the antenna.

Notably, the Matrix Scan Technique (MST) is more susceptible to disruption by noisy shared grounds due to its more complex trigger model and weaker emanations. We were only able to successfully capture compromising emanations when the keyboard was less than one meter away from the shared ground. This setup is particularly interesting because it simulates a practical scenario where an eavesdropper in the basement of a building attempts to recover keystrokes from a keyboard on the fifth floor. However, stable measurements were challenging due to the high environmental variability. We also observed that the main (metallic) water pipe in the building could serve as an antenna, providing a less polluted alternative to the shared ground.

### Perfect Trigger

We conducted the same experiment in an office setting but found that the background noise was too strong, preventing us from detecting the compromising emissions. However, by physically connecting a probe to the data wire, we were able to correctly trigger the emanations. This indicates that the electromagnetic compromising emissions are present in the shared ground, and the limitation lies only in the trigger mechanism. All techniques were applicable across the entire floor (approximately 20 meters) when the keyboard was one meter away from the shared ground.

It is possible to directly connect an oscilloscope to the building's shared ground to eavesdrop on keystrokes. Additionally, an old PC tower used to supply power to tested keyboards can carry the compromising emanations through the shared ground. However, this is beyond the scope of our research, which focuses solely on electromagnetic emanations. To avoid conductive coupling through the power supply, we performed our measurements with keyboards connected to a battery-powered laptop.

### 7. Countermeasures

In this section, we suggest several countermeasures to protect keyboards against the four attacks described.

#### Shielding the Keyboard

The most straightforward solution is to shield the keyboard to reduce electromagnetic radiations. Emanations can originate from the internal electronic components of the keyboard, the communication cable, and the motherboard components. Therefore, shielding the entire keyboard, cable, and part of the motherboard is necessary. A manufacturer informed us that this would at least double the cost of the device, making it impractical for many users. Some keyboards on the market comply with the NATO SDIP-27 standard, but detailed information on emission limits and measurement procedures remains classified.

#### Room Protection

Another approach is to shield the room where vulnerable keyboards are used. For example, the room can be shielded, or a secure physical perimeter (e.g., 100 meters) can be established around it. Attacks 1, 2, and 3 are related to the PS/2 protocol. Encrypting the bi-directional serial communication can prevent unintended information leaks. In modern keyboards, a single chip often contains the controller, driver, detector, and communication interface. Encryption can be implemented in this chip, eliminating direct compromising emanations from the serial communication.

#### Scanning Process Randomization

Attack 4 is related to the scan matrix loop. One solution is to design a new scanning process algorithm. Even if keyboards continue to use the scan matrix loop routine, randomizing the order of column scanning and adding random delays during the scanning process can obfuscate the execution of the subroutine, making keystroke recovery theoretically impossible. Paavilainen [27] proposed high-frequency filtering of matrix signals before they are fed into the keyboard, which can significantly reduce compromising electromagnetic emanations.

### 8. Extensions

Our study has shown that electromagnetic emanations from modern wired and wireless keyboards can be exploited to passively recover keystrokes. Here, we discuss some extensions and remarks.

#### Trigger Improvement

The main limitation of these attacks is the trigger for data acquisition. This can be improved with an independent process using specific filters between the antenna and the ADC. Additionally, other compromising emanations, such as the sound of pressed keys, could be used as triggers. Modern techniques like beamforming can also enhance noise filtering.

#### Multi-Technique Correlation

Simultaneously leveraging multiple techniques can reduce uncertainty in keystroke recovery. For keyboards vulnerable to more than one technique, correlating the results of different techniques can improve accuracy.

#### Accelerating Attacks

Dedicated hardware, such as FPGAs, can accelerate the acquisition, filtering, and decoding processes, making them nearly instantaneous. However, distinguishing keystrokes from multiple keyboards remains challenging, especially for the Matrix Scan Technique, which requires continuous acquisition.

#### Portable Setup

We experimented with different types of antennas and analog-to-digital converters, including the USRP and GNU Radio library, to create a portable version of the Modulation Technique. With a battery-powered laptop and a simple copper wire taped to the attacker’s body, we can recover keystrokes from vulnerable keyboards stealthily, although the eavesdropping range is limited to less than two meters.

### 9. Conclusion

We have provided evidence that modern keyboards radiate compromising electromagnetic emanations. The four techniques presented in this paper demonstrate that these inexpensive devices are generally not sufficiently protected. These emanations can be captured with relatively inexpensive equipment, and keystrokes can be recovered in both semi-anechoic chambers and practical environments.

The security risk posed by these emanations affects PS/2, USB, and wireless keyboards. There is no software patch to mitigate these attacks; replacing the hardware is necessary. Due to cost constraints, manufacturers may not systematically protect keyboards, although some expensive secure keyboards are available, primarily for military and government use.

Future work should consider similar devices, such as ATM keypads, mobile phone keypads, digicodes, printers, and wireless routers. Improving feature extraction algorithms and avoiding peak detection algorithms are also important. Correlating these attacks with non-electromagnetic compromising emanation attacks, such as optical, acoustic, or time-based attacks, could further enhance keystroke recovery.
