### Step 2: Set Up Logs for DHCP Service
To effectively monitor DHCP activity and identify potential issues, you can configure logging for the DHCP service. The DHCP service records diagnostic messages in the system log file. To prevent the log file from becoming excessively large, you can adjust the log settings to suppress most messages. This can be done through the Logging pane in the DHCP service settings. For detailed instructions on setting up logs for the DHCP service, refer to “Setting the Log Detail Level for DHCP Service” on page 15.

### Step 3: Start DHCP Service
For instructions on starting and stopping the DHCP service, see “Starting and Stopping DHCP Service” on page 10.

### Managing DHCP Service
This section provides guidance on setting up and managing the DHCP service on Mac OS X Server. It covers essential tasks such as starting the service, creating subnets, and configuring optional settings like LDAP or DNS for a subnet.

#### Starting and Stopping DHCP Service
Follow these steps to start or stop the DHCP service. Ensure that at least one subnet is created and enabled before proceeding.

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Confirm that at least one subnet and network interface are configured and selected.
3. Click either "Start Service" or "Stop Service."

When the service is active, the "Stop Service" button will be available.

#### Creating Subnets in DHCP Service
Subnets are groups of client computers on the same network, often organized by location (e.g., different floors of a building) or usage (e.g., all eighth-grade students). Each subnet is assigned a range of IP addresses.

To create a new subnet:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the "Subnets" tab.
4. Click "Add," or double-click an existing subnet.
5. Select the "General" tab.
6. Enter a descriptive name for the new subnet (optional).
7. Enter a starting and ending IP address for the subnet range. Addresses must be contiguous and should not overlap with other subnets.
8. Enter the subnet mask for the network address range.
9. Choose the Network Interface from the pop-up menu.
10. Enter the IP address of the router for this subnet. If the server you are configuring is the router for the subnet, use its internal LAN IP address.
11. Define a lease time in hours, days, weeks, or months.
12. If you wish to set DNS, LDAP, or WINS information for this subnet, enter these now. Refer to the following sections for more details:
   - “Setting the DNS Server for a DHCP Subnet” on page 12
   - “Setting LDAP Options for a Subnet” on page 13
   - “Setting WINS Options for a Subnet” on page 13
13. Click "Save."

#### Changing Subnet Settings in DHCP Service
Use Server Admin to modify existing DHCP subnet settings, including IP address range, subnet mask, network interface, router, and lease time.

To change subnet settings:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the "Subnets" tab.
4. Select the subnet you want to edit.
5. Click "Edit."
6. Make the necessary changes, which may include adding DNS, LDAP, or WINS information, redefining address ranges, or redirecting the network interface.
7. Click "Save."

#### Deleting Subnets From DHCP Service
You can delete subnets and their associated IP address ranges when they are no longer needed.

To delete subnets or address ranges:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the subnet you want to delete.
4. Click "Delete."
5. Click "Save" to confirm the deletion.

#### Changing IP Address Lease Times for a Subnet
You can adjust the duration for which IP addresses in a subnet are available to client computers.

To change the lease time for a subnet address range:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the "Subnets" tab.
4. Select the subnet range and click "Edit."
5. Select the "General" tab.
6. Choose a time scale from the "Lease Time" pop-up menu (hours, days, weeks, or months).
7. Enter a number in the "Lease Time" field.
8. Click "Save."

#### Setting the DNS Server for a DHCP Subnet
You can specify which DNS servers and default domain name a subnet should use. The DHCP service provides this information to client computers in the subnet.

To set DNS options for a subnet:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the "Subnets" tab.
4. Select a subnet and click "Edit."
5. Select the "DNS" tab.
6. Enter the default domain of the subnet.
7. Enter the primary and secondary name server IP addresses you want DHCP clients to use.
8. Click "Save."

#### Setting LDAP Options for a Subnet
You can use DHCP to provide clients with LDAP server information, eliminating the need to manually configure each client's LDAP information. The order of LDAP servers in the list determines their search order in the automatic Open Directory search policy.

If you are using this Mac OS X Server as an LDAP master, the LDAP options will be pre-populated. If your LDAP master server is another machine, you need to know the domain name or IP address of the LDAP database and the LDAP search base.

To set LDAP options for a subnet:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the "Subnets" tab.
4. Select a subnet and click "Edit."
5. Click the "LDAP" tab.
6. Enter the domain name or IP address of the LDAP server for this subnet.
7. Enter the search base for LDAP searches.
8. Enter the LDAP port number if you are using a non-standard port.
9. Select "LDAP over SSL" if necessary.
10. Click "Save."

#### Setting WINS Options for a Subnet
You can provide additional information to Windows clients in a subnet by adding Windows-specific settings to the DHCP-supplied network configuration data. These settings allow Windows clients to browse their Network Neighborhood.

You need to know the domain name or IP address of the WINS/NBNS primary and secondary servers (usually the IP address of the DHCP server itself) and the NBT node type (typically "broadcast"). The NBDD Server and NetBIOS Scope ID are usually not used but may be required depending on your Windows clients' configuration and network infrastructure.

To set WINS options for a subnet:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the "Subnets" tab.
4. Select a subnet and click "Edit."
5. Click the "WINS" tab.
6. Enter the domain name or IP address of the WINS/NBNS primary and secondary servers for this subnet.
7. Enter the domain name or IP address of the NBDD server for this subnet.
8. Choose the NBT node type from the pop-up menu.
9. Enter the NetBIOS Scope ID.
10. Click "Save."

#### Disabling Subnets Temporarily
You can temporarily disable a subnet without losing its settings. This means no IP addresses from the subnet’s range will be distributed to any client.

To disable a subnet:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the "Subnets" tab.
4. Deselect "Enable" next to the subnet you want to disable.

#### Monitoring DHCP Service
Monitoring the DHCP service is crucial for maintaining network stability. There are two main ways to monitor the DHCP service: viewing the client list and monitoring the log files generated by the service. The following sections discuss these aspects of monitoring DHCP service.

##### Viewing the DHCP Status Overview
The status overview provides a summary of the DHCP service, including whether it is running, the number of clients, and when the service was started. It also shows how many IP addresses are statically assigned from your subnets and the last time the client database was updated.

To see the overview:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click the "Overview" button.

##### Setting the Log Detail Level for DHCP Service
You can choose the level of detail you want to log for the DHCP service.

- **Low (errors only)**: Indicates conditions requiring immediate action (e.g., if the DHCP server cannot start up). This level corresponds to bootpd reporting in "quiet" mode, with the "-q" flag.
- **Medium (errors and warnings)**: Alerts you to inconsistent data, but the DHCP server can still operate. This level corresponds to default bootpd reporting.
- **High (all events)**: Records all DHCP service activity, including routine functions. This level corresponds to bootpd reporting in "verbose" mode, with the "-v" flag.

To set up the log detail level:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Settings."
3. Select the "Logging" tab.
4. Choose the logging option you want.
5. Click "Save."

##### Viewing DHCP Log Entries
If you have enabled logging for the DHCP service, you can check the system log for DHCP errors.

To see DHCP log entries:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Log."

##### Viewing the DHCP Client List
The DHCP Clients window displays the following information for each client:

- The IP address served to the client.
- The remaining lease time in days, hours, and minutes.
- The DHCP client ID (usually, but not always, the same as the hardware address).
- The computer name.
- The Ethernet ID.

To view the DHCP client list:

1. In Server Admin, select DHCP from the Computers & Services list.
2. Click "Clients."
3. Click any column heading to sort the list by different criteria.

### Where to Find More Information
Request for Comments (RFC) documents provide an overview of protocols and services and details about their behavior. RFCs are useful for both novice and experienced server administrators. You can search for RFC documents by number at [www.faqs.org/rfcs](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs).

For details about DHCP, see RFC 2131.

For more information on bootpd and its advanced configuration options, see the bootpd man page.

### Chapter 2: DNS Service
When clients request a network resource, they typically use a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) rather than an IP address (e.g., 192.168.12.12). The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed database that maps IP addresses to domain names, allowing clients to find resources by name.

A DNS server maintains a list of domain names and their associated IP addresses. When a computer needs to find the IP address for a name, it sends a message to the DNS server (also known as a name server). The name server looks up the IP address and sends it back to the computer. If the name server does not have the IP address locally, it queries other name servers on the Internet until the IP address is found.

Setting up and maintaining a DNS server is complex, so many administrators rely on their Internet Service Provider (ISP) for DNS services. However, if you do not have an ISP to handle DNS requests and meet any of the following criteria, you need to set up DNS service:

- You do not have the option to use DNS from your ISP or another source.
- You plan to make frequent changes to the namespace and want to manage it yourself.
- You have a mail server on your network and face difficulties coordinating with the ISP that maintains your domain.

Mac OS X Server uses Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND v.9.2.2) for its implementation of DNS protocols. BIND is an open-source implementation used by most name servers on the Internet.

### Before You Set Up DNS Service
Consider the following information before setting up DNS on your network. DNS administration is complex, and you should only set up DNS service if you are an experienced DNS administrator.

- Consider creating a "hostmaster" email account to receive and forward emails to the person managing the DNS server. This allows users and other DNS administrators to contact you regarding DNS issues.

### DNS and BIND
Thoroughly understand DNS before setting up your own DNS server. A good resource is "DNS and BIND, 4th edition," by Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu (O’Reilly and Associates, 2001).

**Note:** Apple can help you locate a network consultant to implement your DNS service. Contact Apple Professional Services and Apple Consultants Network at [www.apple.com/services/](http://www.apple.com/services/) or [www.apple.com/consultants](http://www.apple.com/consultants).

### Setting Up Multiple Name Servers
Set up at least one primary and one secondary name server. If the primary server goes down, the secondary server can continue providing service. The secondary server periodically copies domain information from the primary server.

Once a name server learns a name/IP address pair for a host in another domain, the information is cached. DNS information is cached for a set time (TTL value). When the TTL expires, the entry is deleted, and the server requests the information again as needed.

### Setting Up DNS Service for the First Time
If you are using an external DNS name server and entered its IP address in the Setup Assistant, no further action is needed. If you are setting up your own DNS server, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Register Your Domain Name
Domain name registration is managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). IANA ensures that domain names are unique across the Internet. If you do not register your domain name, your network will not be able to communicate over the Internet. (See [www.iana.org](http://www.iana.org) for more information.)

Once registered, you can create subdomains within your domain, provided you set up a DNS server to manage them. For example, if you register "example.com," you can create subdomains like "host1.example.com," "mail.example.com," or "www.example.com." The DNS server for "example.com" keeps track of information for its subdomains, such as host names, static IP addresses, aliases, and mail exchangers.

If your ISP handles your DNS service, inform them of any changes to your namespace, including adding subdomains. The range of IP addresses for a domain must be clearly defined and coordinated with your network administrator or ISP.

#### Step 2: Learn and Plan
If you are new to DNS, learn and understand DNS concepts, tools, and features of Mac OS X Server and BIND. See “Where to Find More Information” on page 41.

Plan your Domain Name System Service. Consider the following questions:

- Do you need a local DNS server? Does your ISP provide DNS service? Can you use Rendezvous names instead?
- How many servers will you need for anticipated load and backup purposes?
- What is your security strategy to deal with unauthorized use?
- How often should you schedule periodic inspections or tests of the DNS records to verify data integrity?
- How many services or devices (like an intranet website or a network printer) will need a name?
- What method should you use to configure DNS?

There are two ways to configure DNS service on Mac OS X Server:

1. **Recommended**: Use Server Admin to set up DNS service. See “Managing DNS Service” on page 21 for instructions.
2. **Alternative**: Edit the BIND configuration file. BIND is the set of programs used by Mac OS X Server to implement DNS. To set up and configure BIND, modify the configuration file and the zone file.

The configuration file is located at:
```
/etc/named.conf
```

The zone file name is based on the zone name. For example, the zone file for "example.com" is located at:
```
/var/named/example.com.zone
```

See “Configuring BIND Using the Command Line” on page 37 for more information.

#### Step 3: Configure Basic DNS Settings
For more information, see “Managing DNS Service” on page 21.

#### Step 4: Create a DNS Zone
Use Server Admin to set up DNS zones. See “Managing Zones” on page 22 for instructions. After adding a master zone, Server Admin automatically creates an NS record with the same name as the Source of Authority (SOA).

#### Step 5: Add Address and Additional Records to the Zone
Use Server Admin to add additional records to your zone. Create an Address record for...
