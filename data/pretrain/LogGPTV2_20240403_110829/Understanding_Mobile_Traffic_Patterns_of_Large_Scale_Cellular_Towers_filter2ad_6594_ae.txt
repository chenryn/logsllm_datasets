56 are the amplitude of one day, phase of one day, and
amplitude of half a day for tower m, respectively. We use
the quadratic programming to solve the problem because
the traﬃc of an actual tower is usually overlayed with var-
ious noises, such that these points close to the plane of the
the polygon may be driven out of the polygon. By solving
this quadratic programming, for points inside the polygon,
we can ﬁnd their exact convex combinations, while for some
point outside the polygon, we can ﬁnd the point in the poly-
gon with the smallest distance to the target point, which is
a good approximation.
We dedicatedly select a list of towers in the comprehen-
sive area. Then, we use the method presented above to solve
the convex combinatorial coeﬃcients of them. We compare
these coeﬃcients with a transform of the previously intro-
duced POI, i.e., the term frequency-inverse document fre-
quency (TF-IDF) of the corresponding types and locations.
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that is intended to reﬂec-
t how important a word is to a document. Similarly, it is
used to reﬂect how important the POI of a speciﬁc type is
in our analysis, which has been proposed in existing works,
i.e., Yuan et al. [27] provided a TF-IDF-based method to
cluster regions of diﬀerent functions, which solely uses the
POI data. Speciﬁcally, TF-IDF can be calculated as the
following:
(IDFi = log(M/Mi),
TF-IDFm
i = IDFi · log(1 + POIm
i ),
where M is the total number of towers, and Mi is the number
of towers of which the POI of type i appears within a speciﬁc
distance, and POIm
is the times that the POI of type i
i
appears within a ﬁxed distance of tower m. To be better
compared with, we normalize the TF-IDF of each tower by
the sum of TF-IDF of all the four types for this tower, which
is called as the normalized TF-IDF (NTF-IDF). This process
can be formulated as the following:
NTF-IDFm
i = TF-IDFm
i /
TF-IDFm

The obtained NTF-IDF is proportional to the POI for each
type, which roughly represents the density of the corre-
sponding function in the corresponding area. Speciﬁcally,
NTF-IDF close to 0 indicates this area do not have the cor-
responding function. However, the largest NTF-IDF do not
completely indicate the corresponding function is dominant
in the area, since it is also inﬂuenced by the size of related
points and corresponding distance. For example, a large and
close subway station has more inﬂuence than a small and far
residential building on a cellular tower.
Then, the result is shown in Table 6. Expect for the towers
in the comprehensive area, the NTF-IDF of the four most
representative towers is also provided in the table. We can
observe that their NTF-IDF of corresponding types is much
larger than others, which is very close to 1, indicating the
areas where they are located have a single type of function.
As for towers in the comprehensive area, There are multiple
relative large NTF-IDF for a cellular tower. As discussed
earlier, this may lead to inaccuracy since the inﬂuence of
the size of related points and corresponding distance. Thus,
we only consider the consistency of the small NTF-IDF and
combination coeﬃcients. We can observe that the majori-
ty of the smallest NTF-IDFm
in all m for some ﬁx i cor-
i
responds to the smallest coeﬃcient in all m for the same i,
respectively. For example, NTF-IDFP 3
1 are
0, and their corresponding coeﬃcients are also 0. Thus, the
obtained convex combination coeﬃcients coincide with the
POI distribution, indicating the correctness of our theory.
2 and NTF-IDFP 4
To further illustrate the convex combination, we take the
tower P5 in Table 6 as an example, and show its combination
of frequency and time domain, respectively in Figure 18 and
Figure 19. For a point inside the polygon, we can ﬁnd its
exact convex combination, that is:

F = F r =
F 0
i xi = F 0
3 +
xi(F 0
i − F 0
3 ).
As shown in Figure 18,
in the feature space, the vector
(0, F r) can be divided to the vector (0, F 3) and the weighted
sum of the vector (F 3, F 1), (F 3, F 2), (F 3, F 4). For P5, the
weights are 0.35, 0.18 and 0.25, respectively, which is just as
coeﬃcients of cluster 1, 2, 4 in Table 6 of P5.
On the other hand, in Figure 19, we show the compo-
nents of traﬃc corresponding to four primary clusters for
the comprehensive tower P5. Areas of diﬀerent colors in the
left ﬁgure represent components of diﬀerent primary traf-
ﬁc patterns. To be better distinguished, each component is

added with a static bias. In addition, we plot each compo-
nent individually in the right ﬁgure. The result indicates
that traﬃc patterns of an arbitrarily cellular tower can be
approximated by a convex combination of four primary traf-
ﬁc patterns. The size of each component is highly related
to density of corresponding function around the tower. It
further demonstrates the correctness and usefulness of our
frequency analysis method.
6. RELATED WORK
The digital footprints of human activities and network be-
haviors contributed by mobile devices have led to a pletho-
ra of investigations on the intersection between human and
network dynamics[14, 15]. This section summarizes relevant
research from three perspectives — data sources, types of
collected data and targeted applications.
236Dataset collected from mobile devices for investigating hu-
man behaviors and network performance can be divided into
two broad categories: (1) data collected from mobile devices
and (2) traces collected by mobile operators [2]. For the
ﬁrst categories, users or experimenters report their semanti-
cally annotated data about the locations, phone usages and
network performance by installing some Apps in their de-
vices[19, 10]. The limitation of this approach comes from
the limited number of users sampled, which cannot stand
for the global characteristics of a large scale cellular net-
work. On the other hand, in the dataset collected by cellular
operators, users are passively monitored and the operators
decide which information to collect[9, 24]. As a result, the
collected data is continuous as long as devices are connected,
and includes detailed information of users behaviors, such as
duration of each Internet connection. As a result, data col-
lected via the second approach enables the study of overall
network behaviors, such as large scale of human mobility
and call activities analysis. In this paper, we use the data
collected by an ISP for investigating the traﬃc patterns of
large scale cellular towers.
Extensive studies have used various types of cellular data
for understanding the characteristics of large scale cellular
towers. For example, cell phone activities, commonly know
as Call Description Records (CDR), are used for capturing
human communication activities[3].
In addition, it is also
used for recovering the human mobility trajectory[9], infer-
ring demographics[6], and uncovering urban ecology[2]. An-
other type of data is the device-level metric obtained from
mobile devices, such as device and application usage[8, 21],
network access bandwidth[10], energy computation[11], per-
sonal GPS locations[28], etc. With the popularity of 3G
and LTE access, mobile and application data traces become
available as well. Cici et al. [2] characterizes the relationship
between people’s application interests and mobility patterns
based on a population of over 280, 000 users of a 3G mobile
network. Lee et al. [16] demonstrated that the spatial dis-
tribution of the traﬃc density can be approximated by the
log-normal or Weibull distribution. However, mobile data
traﬃc across a city-wide range with diﬀerent time scale and
variations contains complicated interaction between the s-
pace and time, which requires a deep and comprehensive
understanding. The analysis and models in this work pro-
vide such insights.
Cellular network traces have been used for enabling a set
of applications. The footprint of mobile devices and cellular
network has been used to model human mobility and tra-
jectories [9, 7, 24, 5]. Barabasi et al.
[9, 23, 22] studied
the mobility behaviors of 100k mobile users by analyzing
the CDR data, and found that the trajectories of human is
not as random as previously proposed levy ﬂight or random
walk models. Instead, it presents a high conﬁdence of pre-
dictability[23], and temporal and spatial regularity[9]. The
cellular network traces have also been used for characteriz-
ing and modelling the cellular data traﬃc patterns. Shaﬁq
et al. [17] modelled the internet traﬃc dynamics of cellular
[12] characterized data usage pattern-
devices. Jin et al.
s in large cellular network. And Zhang et al.
[26] tried to
understand the characteristics of cellular data traﬃc by com-
paring it to wireline data traﬃc. Other studies combine the
CDR, GPS locations, and application traces to investigate
the land usage[24, 20], social interactions[7], location-based
patterns[5], and web and data access patterns[13, 12].
In
this paper, we focus on investigating the mobile data traf-
ﬁc patterns from diﬀerent domains, including time, location
and frequency, which provides a comprehensive understand-
ing of the traﬃc patterns of large scale cellular towers with
a simple but deep model that is able to characterize the city
geographical features and human communication regularity.
In conclusion, we study a large scale urban mobile data
access traces collected by the commercial mobile operators
involving over 9600 towers and 150,000 subscribers. We ﬁrst
design an analysis framework for processing large scale cellu-
lar traﬃc data. Then, we reveals the basic but fundamental
patterns embedded in thousands of cellular towers, which
paves a way toward a comprehensive understanding of the
connection among mobile data traﬃc, urban ecology and
human behaviors.
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we carry out, to the best of our knowledge,
the ﬁrst study of traﬃc patterns embedded in large scale
3G and LTE towers deployed in the urban environment. We
propose a powerful model which combines time, location and
frequency information for analyzing the traﬃc patterns of t-
housands of cellular towers. Our analysis reveals that the
dynamic urban mobile traﬃc usage exhibits only ﬁve ba-
sic time domain patterns.
In addition, the traﬃc of any
tower can be reconstructed accurately using a linear combi-
nation of four primary components corresponding to human
activity behaviors. Our analysis provides a systematic and
comprehensive understanding of dynamic and complicated
mobile traﬃc, and opens a set of new research directions.
