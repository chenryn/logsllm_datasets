### Amplitude and Phase Analysis of Tower Traffic

The parameters \(A_m\), \(\phi_m\), and \(A_{m/2}\) represent the amplitude of one day, phase of one day, and amplitude of half a day for tower \(m\), respectively. We employ quadratic programming to address this problem because the traffic of an actual tower is often overlaid with various noises, which can cause points near the plane of the polygon to be driven out of the polygon. By solving this quadratic programming problem, we can find the exact convex combinations for points inside the polygon. For points outside the polygon, we can determine the point within the polygon that has the smallest distance to the target point, providing a good approximation.

### Selection and Analysis of Towers

We carefully select a list of towers in a comprehensive area and use the method described above to solve for their convex combinatorial coefficients. We then compare these coefficients with a transformed version of the previously introduced Points of Interest (POI), specifically the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) of the corresponding types and locations. TF-IDF is a numerical statistic used to reflect the importance of a word in a document. Similarly, it is used to reflect the importance of a specific type of POI in our analysis. This approach has been proposed in existing works, such as Yuan et al. [27], who provided a TF-IDF-based method to cluster regions of different functions using only POI data.

The TF-IDF can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{IDFi} = \log\left(\frac{M}{M_i}\right) \]
\[ \text{TF-IDF}_{i}^m = \text{IDFi} \cdot \log(1 + \text{POI}_i^m) \]
where \(M\) is the total number of towers, \(M_i\) is the number of towers where the POI of type \(i\) appears within a specific distance, and \(\text{POI}_i^m\) is the frequency of the POI of type \(i\) within a fixed distance of tower \(m\).

To better compare the results, we normalize the TF-IDF of each tower by the sum of the TF-IDFs of all four types for that tower, resulting in the Normalized TF-IDF (NTF-IDF):
\[ \text{NTF-IDF}_{i}^m = \frac{\text{TF-IDF}_{i}^m}{\sum_{j=1}^{4} \text{TF-IDF}_{j}^m} \]

### Results and Observations

The obtained NTF-IDF values are proportional to the POI for each type, roughly representing the density of the corresponding function in the area. An NTF-IDF close to 0 indicates that the area does not have the corresponding function. However, the largest NTF-IDF does not necessarily indicate that the corresponding function is dominant, as it is also influenced by the size of related points and the corresponding distance. For example, a large and close subway station has more influence than a small and far residential building on a cellular tower.

Table 6 shows the convex combination coefficients and NTF-IDF values for selected towers. The NTF-IDF values for the most representative towers are much larger, close to 1, indicating that the areas where they are located have a single type of function. For towers in the comprehensive area, there are multiple relatively large NTF-IDF values, which may lead to inaccuracy due to the influence of the size of related points and the corresponding distance. Therefore, we focus on the consistency of the small NTF-IDF and combination coefficients. We observe that the majority of the smallest NTF-IDF values correspond to the smallest coefficients, confirming the correctness of our theory.

### Convex Combination Example

To further illustrate the convex combination, we use tower P5 from Table 6 as an example. For a point inside the polygon, we can find its exact convex combination:
\[ F = F_r = \sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i F_i' = F_3' + \sum_{i \neq 3} x_i (F_i' - F_3') \]
As shown in Figure 18, in the feature space, the vector \((0, F_r)\) can be decomposed into the vector \((0, F_3)\) and the weighted sum of the vectors \((F_3, F_1)\), \((F_3, F_2)\), and \((F_3, F_4)\). For P5, the weights are 0.35, 0.18, and 0.25, respectively, which match the coefficients of clusters 1, 2, and 4 in Table 6 for P5.

In Figure 19, we show the components of traffic corresponding to four primary clusters for the comprehensive tower P5. Different colors in the left figure represent different primary traffic patterns. Each component is added with a static bias for better distinction, and each component is plotted individually in the right figure. The results indicate that the traffic patterns of any cellular tower can be approximated by a convex combination of four primary traffic patterns. The size of each component is highly related to the density of the corresponding function around the tower, further demonstrating the correctness and usefulness of our frequency analysis method.

### Related Work

The digital footprints of human activities and network behaviors contributed by mobile devices have led to numerous investigations at the intersection of human and network dynamics. This section summarizes relevant research from three perspectives: data sources, types of collected data, and targeted applications.

#### Data Sources

Data collected from mobile devices for investigating human behaviors and network performance can be divided into two broad categories: (1) data collected from mobile devices and (2) traces collected by mobile operators. For the first category, users or experimenters report semantically annotated data about locations, phone usage, and network performance by installing apps on their devices. The limitation of this approach is the limited number of users sampled, which cannot represent the global characteristics of a large-scale cellular network. On the other hand, in the dataset collected by cellular operators, users are passively monitored, and the operators decide which information to collect. This results in continuous data collection as long as devices are connected, including detailed information about user behavior, such as the duration of each Internet connection. This approach enables the study of overall network behaviors, such as large-scale human mobility and call activity analysis. In this paper, we use data collected by an ISP to investigate the traffic patterns of large-scale cellular towers.

#### Types of Collected Data

Extensive studies have used various types of cellular data to understand the characteristics of large-scale cellular towers. For example, Call Detail Records (CDR) are used to capture human communication activities, recover human mobility trajectories, infer demographics, and uncover urban ecology. Another type of data is device-level metrics obtained from mobile devices, such as device and application usage, network access bandwidth, energy computation, and personal GPS locations. With the popularity of 3G and LTE access, mobile and application data traces have become available. Cici et al. [2] characterized the relationship between people's application interests and mobility patterns based on a population of over 280,000 users of a 3G mobile network. Lee et al. [16] demonstrated that the spatial distribution of traffic density can be approximated by log-normal or Weibull distributions. However, mobile data traffic across a city-wide range with different time scales and variations contains complex interactions between space and time, requiring a deep and comprehensive understanding. The analysis and models in this work provide such insights.

#### Targeted Applications

Cellular network traces have been used for a variety of applications. The footprint of mobile devices and cellular networks has been used to model human mobility and trajectories. Barabasi et al. [9, 23, 22] studied the mobility behaviors of 100,000 mobile users by analyzing CDR data and found that human trajectories are not as random as previously proposed Levy flight or random walk models. Instead, they exhibit high predictability and temporal and spatial regularity. Cellular network traces have also been used to characterize and model cellular data traffic patterns. ShaÔ¨Åq et al. [17] modeled the internet traffic dynamics of cellular devices, Jin et al. [12] characterized data usage patterns in large cellular networks, and Zhang et al. [26] compared cellular data traffic to wireline data traffic. Other studies combine CDR, GPS locations, and application traces to investigate land usage, social interactions, location-based patterns, and web and data access patterns.

In this paper, we focus on investigating mobile data traffic patterns from different domains, including time, location, and frequency, providing a comprehensive understanding of the traffic patterns of large-scale cellular towers with a simple but deep model that characterizes city geographical features and human communication regularity.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study of traffic patterns embedded in large-scale 3G and LTE towers deployed in an urban environment. We propose a powerful model that combines time, location, and frequency information to analyze the traffic patterns of thousands of cellular towers. Our analysis reveals that dynamic urban mobile traffic usage exhibits only five basic time domain patterns. Additionally, the traffic of any tower can be accurately reconstructed using a linear combination of four primary components corresponding to human activity behaviors. Our analysis provides a systematic and comprehensive understanding of dynamic and complex mobile traffic, opening new research directions.
