Sorry for my poor English~  
My project dependencies are:
     "devDependencies": {
        "babel-core": "^6.24.0",
        "babel-loader": "^6.4.0",
        "babel-preset-env": "^1.2.1",
        "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.24.0",
        "html-webpack-plugin": "^2.28.0",
        "webpack": "^2.2.1",
        "webpack-dev-server": "^2.4.1"
      }
And the webpack.config.js has a loader :
         test: /\.(js|jsx)/,
         use: "babel-loader?presets[]=env",
         exclude: /(node_modules|idea)/
the code:
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; console.log(i),i++) {
                let i = "abc";
                console.log(i);
    }
expected result:
    abc
    0
    abc
    1
    abc
    2
but output
    abc
    abc
Is that a BUG?
