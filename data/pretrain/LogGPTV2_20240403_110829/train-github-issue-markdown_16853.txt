After the 0.19.0 update, there is an issue with the alignment of FancyZones
when there is a change in multiple monitor setup (either
connecting/disconnecting my Surface Pro to/from the second monitor). My
taskbar positioning is at the top and it seems like the FancyZones thinks that
the Taskbar is at the bottom and disregards the area covered by the Taskbar at
the top, which leads to this misalignment. It works fine if I restart
PowerToys after every change (connect/disconnect) in multiple monitor setup.
