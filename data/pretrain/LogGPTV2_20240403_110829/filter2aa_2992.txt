Secure Penetration 
Testing Operations 
Demonstrated Weaknesses in  
Learning Material and Tools 
Bio 
• Co-Founder of HORNE Cyber, previously 
Halberd Group 
• Directs and participates 
• Penetration testing engagements 
• Research and development 
• Adjunct professor at Mississippi State University 
• NSA-CAE Cyber Operations program 
• Information Security & Reverse Engineering 
Insecure practices used on penetration tests put  
clients and penetration testers alike at risk. 
Penetration testers and clients during/between  
engagements are attractive soft targets. 
The root cause of this problem is a lack of awareness, 
and learning materials that teach insecure practices. 
This has to change. 
The Situation at a Glance 
• Previous and Current Work 
• The Threat 
• Role of Learning and Reference Materials 
• Analysis of Currently-Available Materials 
• Recommended Best Practices 
• Demonstration and Tool Release 
• Snagterpreter – Hijack meterpreter sessions 
• Conclusions 
• Call to Action 
What are we covering today? 
Two previous papers & presentations, DEF CON 21 and 23 
Where are we? 
This work – a paper and talk studying the root 
causes of these issues, recommending change. 
Why is the compromise of a  
penetration tester attractive? 
As a Target 
Tools, tactics, procedures. Intellectual property. 
Operational Cover For Compromising Clients 
Testers are expected to break rules, attack,  
elevate privilege, exfiltrate. 
The Threat 
No Standard 
Dependent on experience, intuition, pattern recognition,  
and complex ad-hoc processes 
Tradeoff: Flexibility vs. Rigor 
We operate as we learn 
Lowest Common Denominator = Profit 
No formal requirements for education 
Few prerequisites 
No testing requirements 
Cause and Effect 
Testing Processes Follow Training 
Convenience and Expediency 
Lower Depth & Breadth of Technical Knowledge 
Lack of Situational Awareness in Secure 
Operation/Communication 
Re-applying procedures learned in reading/training to 
more complex operational environments 
Cause and Effect 
How are secure practices in 
penetration testing covered  
(or not covered) in learning and 
reference materials? 
Books, Training, Standards 
Documents 
The Study – The Goal 
Books: 16 
Top Amazon results, well-known and popular books 
Training: 3 
Publicly available material, limited (NDAs, cost) 
Standards: 4 
Well known 
The Study – The Material 
Disclosure: 
You’ll see from the results: the lack of coverage of secure 
practices, and the promotion of vulnerable practices, is the 
norm, not an outlier. 
Titles, author names, sources, are not stated. The purpose is 
to demonstrate an industry-wide need to move forward. 
 Examples are provided, if you’re well-read, you may 
recognize them. 
The Study – Disclosure 
Host Security, 
Penetration Tester 
Does the work address precautions for 
preventing penetration testers’ systems 
from being compromised? 
The Study – The Questions 
Host Security, Client 
Does the work address precautions for 
maintaining the security of client 
systems during the test? 
The Study – The Questions 
COMSEC 
Does the work address establishing 
secure means of communicating with 
the client about the engagement? 
The Study – The Questions 
Client Data in Transit 
Does the work address issues 
surrounding the transmission of 
sensitive client data between targets 
and penetration testers’ systems in the 
course of the engagement? 
The Study – The Questions 
Client Data at Rest 
Does the work discuss procedures for 
securing client data at rest, during, 
and/or after the engagement? 
The Study – The Questions 
OSINT OPSEC 
Does the work address operational 
security during intelligence gathering 
phases? 
The Study – The Questions 
Potential Threats 
Does the work address issues with 
conducting tests against systems over 
hostile networks, such as the public 
Internet or unencrypted wireless? 
The Study – The Questions 
Insecure Practices 
Does the work demonstrate or teach at 
least one example of an insecure 
practice without describing how it might 
leave the tester or client vulnerable?

Mostly red! 
Almost 
every one 
specifically 
teaches 
insecure 
practice. 
Out of 24 works… 
14 did not address basic issues.  
4 addressed more than two issues.  
Every work that actually covered technical 
practices described actions that were potentially 
dangerous/insecure. 
2 did not cover technical practices  
1 Warned about unencrypted networks  
Analysis 
Unencrypted 
command and control 
netcat, web shells, default 
meterpreter, etc. 
Analysis – Most Common Flaw 
You’ll have to attend or watch 
the talk itself to hear specific 
(an humorous) examples of 
the most insecure practices 
presented in the works 
studied. 
“Greatest Hits” 
Client Communication Security 
OSINT OPSEC 
Awareness 
Host Security – Client and Pentester 
Data at Rest 
Recommendations 
Demonstration 
Snagterpreter 
Hijacking HTTP/HTTPS meterpreter sessions. 
•
Metasploit’s Meterpreter – Most commonly used and documented 
penetration testing implant/post-exploitation tool. 
•
Easy to use, more fully featured than a shell, therefore popular 
•
Operational use – Often traversing hostile networks, such as the 
public Internet. 
•
Protocols 
•
Type-Length-Value – Commands & Responses 
•
Transport – TCP, or HTTP/HTTPS for stateless resilience 
•
Default encryption is for evasion, not security! 
•
The developers know this, have implemented paranoid mode to 
validate server & client certificates 
•
Nobody teaches anyone how to use this apart from official docs 
•
Let’s demonstrate non-paranoid-mode hijacking… 
What’s going on in this demo? 
Penetration tester, 
test thyself! 
Conclusions 
•
In this work: 
•
Explained threats 
•
Demonstrated vulnerabilities 
•
You cannot have it both ways 
•
You can’t report on vulnerabilities in situations involving 
malicious actors intercepting and modifying traffic. 
•
…while ignoring that threat model in your own operations 
•
We must improve 
•
Tools 
•
Techniques 
•
Processes 
•
It all has to be integrated into learning material

Penetration testers put their selves and clients at risk with 
insecure practices. Third-party malicious attackers can take 
advantage of this. 
•
The root cause: Learning material available teach insecure 
practices and do not address security issues. This leads to lack of 
rigor in penetration testing practices. 
•
Direct and mindful action must be taken by penetration testers, 
tool developers, and learning material authors to remedy this 
problem.
