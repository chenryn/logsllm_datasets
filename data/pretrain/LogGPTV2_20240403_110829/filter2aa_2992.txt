**Secure Penetration Testing Operations**
- Demonstrated Weaknesses in Learning Material and Tools

**Bio:**
- Co-Founder of HORNE Cyber (formerly Halberd Group)
- Directs and participates in penetration testing engagements
- Engages in research and development
- Adjunct Professor at Mississippi State University
- Part of the NSA-CAE Cyber Operations program
- Specializes in Information Security & Reverse Engineering

**Introduction:**
Insecure practices used in penetration testing put both clients and testers at risk. Penetration testers and their clients are attractive targets for malicious actors, particularly during and between engagements. The root cause of this problem is a lack of awareness and learning materials that teach insecure practices. This situation must change.

**Overview:**
- Previous and Current Work
- The Threat
- Role of Learning and Reference Materials
- Analysis of Currently-Available Materials
- Recommended Best Practices
- Demonstration and Tool Release
- Snagterpreter: Hijack Meterpreter Sessions
- Conclusions
- Call to Action

**What Are We Covering Today?**
- Two previous papers and presentations from DEF CON 21 and 23
- A study on the root causes of these issues and recommendations for change

**Why Is the Compromise of a Penetration Tester Attractive?**
- **As a Target:**
  - Tools, tactics, and procedures
  - Intellectual property
  - Operational cover for compromising clients
  - Testers are expected to break rules, attack, elevate privileges, and exfiltrate data

**The Threat:**
- **No Standard:**
  - Dependent on experience, intuition, pattern recognition, and complex ad-hoc processes
  - Tradeoff: Flexibility vs. Rigor
  - Low formal requirements for education and testing
  - Lack of standardized training and prerequisites

**Cause and Effect:**
- **Testing Processes Follow Training:**
  - Convenience and expediency
  - Lower depth and breadth of technical knowledge
  - Lack of situational awareness in secure operation and communication
  - Re-applying procedures learned in training to more complex operational environments

**How Are Secure Practices in Penetration Testing Covered (or Not Covered) in Learning and Reference Materials?**
- **Books, Training, Standards Documents:**
  - **Study Goal:**
    - Analyzed 16 books (top Amazon results, well-known and popular)
    - Examined 3 publicly available training materials (limited by NDAs and cost)
    - Reviewed 4 well-known standards documents

**Disclosure:**
- The lack of coverage of secure practices and the promotion of vulnerable practices are the norm, not the exception.
- Titles, author names, and sources are not stated to demonstrate an industry-wide need for improvement.
- Examples are provided, and you may recognize them if you are well-read.

**Study Questions:**
1. **Host Security (Penetration Tester):** Does the work address precautions for preventing penetration testers' systems from being compromised?
2. **Host Security (Client):** Does the work address precautions for maintaining the security of client systems during the test?
3. **COMSEC:** Does the work address establishing secure means of communicating with the client about the engagement?
4. **Client Data in Transit:** Does the work address issues surrounding the transmission of sensitive client data between targets and penetration testers' systems?
5. **Client Data at Rest:** Does the work discuss procedures for securing client data at rest, during, and after the engagement?
6. **OSINT OPSEC:** Does the work address operational security during intelligence gathering phases?
7. **Potential Threats:** Does the work address issues with conducting tests over hostile networks, such as the public Internet or unencrypted wireless?
8. **Insecure Practices:** Does the work demonstrate or teach at least one example of an insecure practice without describing its vulnerabilities?

**Results:**

**Analysis:**
- Almost every resource teaches at least one insecure practice.
- Out of 24 works:
  - 14 did not address basic issues.
  - 4 addressed more than two issues.
  - Every work that covered technical practices described potentially dangerous or insecure actions.
  - 2 did not cover technical practices.
  - 1 warned about unencrypted networks.

**Most Common Flaw:**
- Unencrypted command and control (e.g., netcat, web shells, default Meterpreter, etc.)

**Recommendations:**
- **Client Communication Security:**
- **OSINT OPSEC:**
- **Awareness:**
- **Host Security (Client and Penetration Tester):**
- **Data at Rest:**

**Demonstration:**
- **Snagterpreter:**
  - Hijacks HTTP/HTTPS Meterpreter sessions.
  - **Meterpreter:**
    - Most commonly used and documented penetration testing implant/post-exploitation tool.
    - Easy to use, more fully featured than a shell, therefore popular.
    - Often traverses hostile networks, such as the public Internet.
    - **Protocols:**
      - Type-Length-Value (Commands & Responses)
      - Transport: TCP, or HTTP/HTTPS for stateless resilience
      - Default encryption is for evasion, not security.
      - Developers have implemented paranoid mode to validate server and client certificates.
      - Few resources teach how to use this mode.
    - **Demo:**
      - Non-paranoid-mode hijacking

**Conclusions:**
- Explained threats
- Demonstrated vulnerabilities
- You cannot report on vulnerabilities while ignoring your own threat model.
- We must improve tools, techniques, and processes.
- These improvements must be integrated into learning materials.

**Take-Away Points:**
- Penetration testers put themselves and clients at risk with insecure practices.
- Third-party malicious attackers can take advantage of this.
- The root cause is learning material that teaches insecure practices and does not address security issues.
- Direct and mindful action must be taken by penetration testers, tool developers, and learning material authors to remedy this problem.
