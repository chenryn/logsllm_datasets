PoPs (excluding the degree one nodes), and the number of inter-
PoP logical links (note that multiple physical links are mapped to
a single logical link here because these represent redundant infor-
mation). The table also shows the resulting number of unknowns
(trafﬁc matrix elements to be estimated) relative to the number of
measurements (or links), and average estimation errors. Clearly we

can see a direct relationship between the ratio of unknowns to mea-
surements, and the performance of the algorithm.
This illustrates the basis for the MMI method. It will work best
where either the conditionally independent estimate is good to start
with, or the topology has sufﬁciently diverse links to allow for the
results to be accurately reﬁned. The networks measured by Rocket-
fuel appear to have such diversity.

Table 2: The table shows, for the three Rocketfuel PoP level
topologies: the number of PoPs (excluding degree one PoPs),
inter-PoP links (parallel links aggregated), and the number of
unknowns per link measurement. The table also shows the val-
ues for Star and Clique topologies with N nodes (N = 20 in
the examples), and for the original ISP. The ﬁnal two columns
of the table give the performance (relative mean error) of the
MMI algorithm on each topology for the geographic and ran-
dom mappings. Note that the results for the ISP are at PoP
level, obtained by aggregation from BR-BR trafﬁc matrices, so
the random mapping is not available.
5.3.2 Results based on random mapping
However, there is more to the problem than this. In fact it ap-
pears that there is a relationship between the network trafﬁc, and the
network topology that beneﬁts the performance of the algorithm.
Figure 4 (b) also shows the result of mapping the locations in the
original ISP to the Rocketfuel ISPs using a random permutation (the
ﬁgure is based on 100 random permutations of 24 data sets drawn
from one day in June). The performance under a random mapping
is worse than under a geographical mapping. The last column of
Table 2 conﬁrms this ﬁnding.
This is interesting because, typically in large networks, regions of
the network with higher demand tend to have more connections to
the other PoPs (in the measured network the correlation coefﬁcient
between node degree and trafﬁc volume was 0.7). A higher degree
at a node results in more information about the corresponding row
of the trafﬁc matrix, and thence a better estimate of this row. Good
estimates of the larger elements make it easier to estimate other ele-
ments elsewhere in the network, and so we get a better overall result.
This naturally leads to better estimates when the trafﬁc is correlated
to the network degree, but when we perform the random mapping,
the correlation no longer holds. We shall see later that this property
has an impact on the design of network measurement infrastructure
to further improve trafﬁc matrix estimates: it is better to put mea-
surement infrastructure in the nodes with the largest trafﬁc volume.
Also interesting is the fact that this ﬁnding adds credibility to the
choice model idea presented in [16]. The choice model asserts that
features of the network (such as the number of links) are correlated
with the attractiveness of that node as a destination, and we can
conﬁrm that ﬁnding here, at least with respect to the number of links.
6. ROBUSTNESS
A critical requirement for any algorithm that will be applied to
real network data is robustness. In general this refers to the sensi-
tivity of an algorithm to violations of the algorithm’s assumptions
(implicit and explicit). In the MMI method, the only assumptions
are that the MMI criteria is a reasonable approach (veriﬁed above)

and that the input data are correct. Network data are often error
prone, and there can be missing data, and so we must consider how
robust the algorithm is to such errors. In the following sections we
consider the impact of incorrect or missing link data, and incorrect
routing data on the MMI algorithm. Only the latter form of incorrect
input data has an important impact on the results of the algorithm.
6.1 Incorrect Link Data
Like any measurements, SNMP link data contain errors. There-
fore, we shall introduce a range of errors, and study their impact.
Comparisons with ﬂow level data have shown that errors in either
source are not generally large, and the sources of such errors lead
one to believe that they will not be strongly correlated. Hence we
shall introduce independent Gaussian errors to the measurements y
and compare with the zero error case. More speciﬁcally, take the er-
ror in the measurement of link i to be εi ∼ N (0, σ), where N (0, σ)
is the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation σ. We
vary σ from 0 to 0.1, with the latter corresponding to quite large
relative errors in the measurements (remember the 95th percentiles
of the normal distribution lie at ±1.96σ.)
Also note that errors on access and peering links will have min-
imal impact on a BR to BR trafﬁc matrix because the data from
access links is aggregated across many links (to form the trafﬁc vol-
umes entering and exiting the network at a router) and so we only
consider here errors in the backbone-link trafﬁc measurements.
Figure 5 shows the CDF of the results given different noise levels.
Clearly noise impacts the results, but note that the additional errors
in the measurements are actually smaller (for the most part) than
the introduced errors in the measurements. This is likely due to
the redundant link constraints, which provide an averaging effect to
reduce the impact of individual errors. Table 3 presents a summary.

6.2 Missing Link Data
We next consider the impact of missing data, for instance missing
because a link was not polled over an extended interval. A few miss-
ing data points can be replaced using interpolation; trading missing
data for data with some error. Furthermore, ERs are typically con-
nected very simply to the backbone (typically by sets of redundant
links), and almost all (> 99%) of ER trafﬁc is between the back-
bone and the edge. Thus if data are missing from a single edge link
we may estimate the corresponding trafﬁc using measurements of
the trafﬁc between the ER and the backbone. Thus, except in the

rare case where we miss multiple edge links, we need only consider
missing backbone link data.
Figure 6 shows the effect of missing the top N backbone links
(rated in terms of trafﬁc on those links). The results are shown for
the 24 data sets from each of three days in June. The results show
that despite loosing the links with the largest trafﬁc, the results are
hardly impacted at all (though the step appears because one of these
links is actually important). This suggests that there is generally
enough redundant information in the network to compensate for the
missing links (except in one case).
6.3 Incorrect Routing Data
A third source of data in which we may ﬁnd errors is the rout-
ing matrix. Errors in this matrix can have a large impact on the
performance of estimation methods, because if we have errors in a
signiﬁcant number of routes, this corresponds to changing many el-
ements of the matrix from 1 (in the absence of load sharing) to zero
and visa versa. However, as in all other reports on trafﬁc matrix
estimation, we assume the routing matrix input is accurate. This as-
sumption is reasonable because there are good methods for reliably
obtaining routing information (for instance see [19]).
7. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
One major beneﬁt of adopting the information theoretic approach
describe here is that it provides a natural framework for including
additional information. In this section, we examine the impact of
two sources of information: (i) ﬂow level data at some locations,
and (ii) the local trafﬁc matrix at a router [25].
