ABSTRACT
Systems relying on satellite positioning techniques such as
GPS can be targeted by spooﬁng attacks, where attack-
ers try to inject fake positioning information. With the
growing spread of ﬂying drones and their usage of GPS
for localization, these systems become interesting targets
of attacks with the purpose of hijacking or to distract air
safety surveillance. The most recent development in air
traﬃc surveillance is the automatic dependent surveillance
– broadcast (ADS-B). Aircraft periodically broadcast their
location, speed, or environmental measurements via ADS-B.
The open research project OpenSky Network collects ADS-B
reports and makes them available for research purposes.
This poster presents a concept to detect and localize spoof-
ing devices by utilizing the information provided by a large-
scale air traﬃc surveillance system. We utilize ADS-B re-
ports collected by the OpenSky Network and provide ﬁrst
results on the eﬀectiveness of localizing spooﬁng sources.
1. MOTIVATION
GPS is used in many applications that rely on positioning
or timing information. However, the system is not secure,
i. e., GPS signals sent by the satellites are neither authenti-
cated nor encrypted [19]. Consequently, GPS is vulnerable
to signal spooﬁng attacks, where an attacker transmits fake
signals that imitate signals from satellites but at a higher
power and at diﬀerent time delays [5, 6]. GPS receivers will
lock on to the fake signals instead of to the signals from
the authentic satellites. This gives rise to attackers that try
to inject fake positioning information in systems that, e. g.,
realize navigation for drones or in aircraft [8]. As a result,
aircraft that are aﬀected by this type of attack, will broad-
cast the false positioning information using ADS-B [2, 11,
17, 16]. Since the fake information contained in the ADS-B

reports depend on the attacker-induced signals, we try to ex-
tract information to determine the attacker’s location. This
could help to shut down attacks faster to resolve potentially
devastating incidents.
2. CONTRIBUTIONS
The poster will present a concept for detecting GPS spoof-
ing attacks and for localizing the spooﬁng source using an
existing infrastructure based on ADS-B reports. In partic-
ular, the poster will outline a novel technique for the local-
ization of GPS spooﬁng devices via relating the fake posi-
tioning information reports contained in ADS-B messages.
Finally, the poster will brieﬂy foreshadow ﬁrst simulation
results based on real-world air traﬃc control data from the
OpenSky Network [14, 15]. The results show that using the
messages from at least four aircraft, it is possible to detect
and localize spooﬁng devices by rapidly narrowing down a
potential search radius.
3. METHOD
Our novel method leverages existing position advertise-
ments that aircraft periodically broadcast for air traﬃc con-
trol purposes. We use the reported position information
from the spoofed aircraft and the timestamps that are gener-
ated in the ground-based sensors. While other works [12, 13,
9, 7] focus on spooﬁng detection, we go further and explore
the possibility of localizing the spooﬁng source. Further,
we are considering moving targets like aircraft in the sense
that both the target itself and the spoofed positions are non-
stationary. Compared to other suggestions [1, 20, 10], our
approach is lightweight and does not require modiﬁcations
of the GPS receiving devices, and it uses already available
data collected in real-time by air traﬃc control authorities
and online ﬂight tracking services. The reports collected by
multiple ground-based sensors can be used to (i) detect GPS
spooﬁng attacks and (ii) localize the spooﬁng source.
4. SPOOFING DETECTION
We can detect spooﬁng attacks on the logical level via
cross-checking multiple position estimates from each aircraft
or by checking the reported locations from multiple aircraft.
The ﬁrst approach checks if the actual position of the air-
craft resolved by other means like RADAR or multilatera-
tion [4, 3] is within a certain range of the position reported
914via ADS-B. A distance too far oﬀ can be an indication of a
spooﬁng attack. The latter approach is based on a compari-
son of the position reports from multiple aircraft, which will
be similar if the aircraft are aﬀected by the same spooﬁng
attack. A mutual distance that violates air traﬃc restric-
tions can point towards the presence of an ongoing spooﬁng
attack.
5. SPOOFER LOCALIZATION
When we have successfully detected a spooﬁng attack, we
need to trace the source in order to stop the spooﬁng attack.
The localization approach is based on the following observa-
tions. A spoofer that aﬀects multiple aircraft has diﬀerent
distances to each of the reached aircraft. Based on these dis-
tances, the aircraft have diﬀerent positions on the moving
track, which can be expressed as a function of the distance
to the spooﬁng source and the velocity of the spoofed GPS
track.
At the ground stations, we receive the ADS-B reports of
all the aﬀected aircraft. With these reports we can formu-
late relationships incorporating the actual position of the
aircraft, the spoofed track velocity, and the current spoofer
position. We can estimate the position of the aircraft via,
e. g., multilateration and we can calculate the spoofed track
velocity based on the time series of reported GPS positions.
Considering these relationships, we can numerically solve
multiple equations towards the spoofer position, which is
assumed to be the same for all currently aﬀected aircraft.
6. RESULTS
Our ﬁrst results suggest that we can narrow down the
spoofer location to a search space with a radius of a few
kilometers. Taking the overall search space into consider-
ation, which is every position an attacker can sent signals
from, this represents a signiﬁcant reduction. For instance,
we were able to reduce the search radius to less than ten
kilometers as compared to several hundreds or even thou-
sands of square kilometers that is observed by the sensors.
These initial results are based on conservative assumptions
and are expected to improve further.
Additionally, we can state that our method only requires
the fake signals of four aircraft to start narrowing down the
potential spoofer location. We achieved reasonable search
space reductions within a few minutes after the spooﬁng
attack is launched.
7. RELATED WORK
GPS is known to be vulnerable to jamming and spooﬁng
attacks [5, 6]. The requirements for successful GPS spoof-
ing attacks are analyzed in [18]. In [1], the authors propose
general techniques for detecting and localizing spooﬁng at-
tacks in wireless networks. The same authors [20] extended
the scheme to deal with attackers varying the transmission
power. GPS spooﬁng detection approaches that employ mul-
tiple sensors at separated locations are discussed by Tippen-
hauer et al. [18, 7].
Even though these detection approaches do not require
changes to the GPS infrastructure, they still have a crucial
drawback. They assume more specialized GPS receivers in-
creasing, e. g., the complexity and power requirements. This
is potentially critical since aerial standardization processes
take a very long time as compared to other industries.
