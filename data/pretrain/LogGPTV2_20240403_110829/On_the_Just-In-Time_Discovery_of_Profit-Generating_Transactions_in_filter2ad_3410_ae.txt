SMT, respectively, using a relatively unoptimized implemen-
tation. We ﬁnd that the capital requirements to extract the
found revenues are minimal: the majority of strategies pro-
duced require less than 150.00 ETH (60,000 USD), without,
and less than 1.00 ETH (400 USD) with ﬂash loans.
Our
techniques
We quantitatively demonstrate some troubling security im-
plications of proﬁtable transactions on the blockchain con-
sensus. Given optimal adversarial strategies provided by a
Markov Decision Process, we quantify the threshold value at
which an MEV-aware rational miner will fork the blockchain
if the miner does not succeed in claiming an unconﬁrmed
MEV opportunity ﬁrst. For example, on the current Ethereum
network, a 10% hash rate miner will fork the chain if an
MEV opportunity exceeds 4 block rewards. As a comparison,
the bZx opportunity exceeded the Ethereum block reward by
a factor of 874×! Our work hence quantiﬁes the inherent
tension between revenue extraction from proﬁtable transac-
tions and blockchain security. We can generally expect trading
opportunities highlighted in this paper to expand as the DeFi
ecosystem grows and becomes more popular.

Fig. 14: Minimum MEV value in terms of block rewards to
fork a PoW blockchain, given by optimal adversarial strategies
of the MDP. For instance, on Ethereum (rs = 5.72%), a miner
with 10% hash rate will engage to fork the chain to exploit an
MEV opportunity, if the adversary follows the optimal strategy
and the MEV opportunity yields more than 4 block rewards.
and leave a simulation to future work. We can imagine that
multiple miners either collaborate to share an MEV proﬁt
(which falls back to our MDP game of one adversary), or
the miners would compete among each other, which is likely
to exacerbate the fork rate and hence further deteriorates the
blockchain consensus security.
VIII. RELATED WORK
While the research literature of blockchain span over 10
years, DeFi is a relatively recent area with fewer works.
DeFi: There is a growing body of literature focusing on the
security of the DeFi ecosystem. Blockchain front-running in
exchanges, games, gambling, mixer, the network layer, and
name services is soundly studied [1], [12], [20], [25], [32],
[42], [47], [61]. Daian et al. [20] demonstrate a thorough
analysis of proﬁting from opportunities provided by trans-
action ordering. Xu et al. [60] presents a detailed study of
a speciﬁc market manipulation scheme, pump-and-dump, and
build a prediction model that estimates the pump likelihood of
each coin. Gudgeon et al. [37] explore the possibility of a DeFi
crisis due to the design weakness of DeFi protocols and present
a stress testing framework. Qin et al. [53] investigate DeFi
attacks through ﬂash loans and how to optimize their proﬁt.
We remark that the optimization solution presented in [53]
only applies to previously ﬁxed attack vectors, while this work
considers the composability of DeFi protocols.
Smart Contract Analysis: Besides the above-mentioned
works on DeFi, many studies on the vulnerability discovery
of smart contracts are related to our work [10], [13], [16],
[19], [36], [38], [39], [41], [43], [45], [48], [56], [57]. Tradi-
tional smart contract vulnerabilities examined in related work
include, for instance, re-entrancy attack, unhandled exceptions,
locked ether, overﬂow [48]. To the best of our knowledge, no
