User: Every time I make a change to a python script I have to reload python and re-import the module. Please advise how I can modify my scripts and run then without having to relaunch python in the terminal.
Thanks.
Assistant: Do you mean that you enter script directly into the interactive python shall, or are you executing your .py file from the terminal by running something like python myscript.py?
