Many of the issues discussed in this paper are in no way
new, but have been ﬂoating around for a number of years.
Our  main  contributions  stem  from  addressing  mobility,
multihoming and related security at the same time, and ar-
guing how they can be handled in a fairly orthogonal way.
In  particular,  we  deﬁne  an  orthogonal  end-host  mobility
and  multihoming  architecture,  where  the  properties  for
end-points, parallel communication paths (i.e. multi-hom-
ing),  mobility,  and  related  security1  are  neatly  separated
into different dimensions. 
The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In
Section 2 we discuss the nature of mobility and multi-hom-
ing,  thereby  paving  the  way  for  the  forthcoming  discus-
sion.  Section 3  includes  brief  summary  of  the  most
important related work. Section 4 deﬁnes the proposed new 
architecture  in  detail,  and  Section 5  discusses  it  from  the
security point of view. Section 6 reports our current imple-
mentation status. Finally, Section 7 concludes this paper.
1 To be more precise, in this context “security” means mobility 
and multi-homing related signalling authorization, i.e. access 
control on believing in the contents of received mobility or 
multi-homing signalling messages. Especially, it does not de-
note generic application-level end-to-end security.

Background
In this section we summarize the necessary background for
the following discussion. We limit this background discus-
sion to analysing mobility and multihoming from an end-
host point of view, illustrating the resulting security prob-
lems. Later, in Section 4, we return to these concepts; there
we show that they are actually quite similar and, under cer-
tain circumstances, may be taken as duals of each other.
2.1. Mobility
For the purposes of this paper, we deﬁne mobility to denote
the phenomenon where an entity moves while keeping its
communication context active (see e.g. [2]). With that we
mean that an end-host, i.e. a computational unit hosting a
number of communicating processes, changes its topologi-
cal  point  of  attachment.  At  the  same  time,  however,  we
want to make sure that all active communication contexts
remain active, and the processes do not see mobility other
than, possibly, in changes to the actually experienced qual-
ity of service.
To reﬂect reality, we assume that there are a number of
mobile nodes that attach to a relatively ﬁxed network (see
Figure 1). Furthermore, we assume that the network layer
address  preﬁxes  are  structurally  determined  by  the  net-
work. That is, we assume that the network topology deter-
mines the routing related portion of the IP layer addresses.
This assumption reﬂects the fact that in a large network it is
important, in order to keep the routing table sizes managea-
ble, to keep routing preﬁxes consistent with the network to-
pology.  Furthermore,  for  the  sake  of  simplicity,  the
considerations for link local, site local, anycast, and multi-
cast addresses are beyond the scope of this paper. That is,
we assume that all addresses are globally routable, unless
explicitly stated otherwise.
As  a  consequence  of  these  assumptions,  whenever  a
node moves, its network layer address necessarily changes.
Thus, in order to continue to communicate, the host must
be able to signal the changes in its addresses to its active
peers. Furthermore, this signalling must be secure since un-
secured signalling can lead to a unauthorized trafﬁc diver-
sion and denial-of-service attacks.
2.2. Multihoming
Multi-homing refers to a situation where an end-point has
several parallel communication paths that it can use. Usu-
ally multi-homing is a result of either the host having sev-
eral network interfaces (end-host multi-homing) or due to a
network between the host and the rest of the network hav-
ing redundant paths (site multi-homing). In this paper we
concentrate on end-host multihoming.
From our theoretical point of view, a multihomed end-
host  is  a  node  that  has  two  or  more  points-of-attachment
with the rest of the network. This is illustrated in Figure 2.
This situation can be characterized as the node being reach-
