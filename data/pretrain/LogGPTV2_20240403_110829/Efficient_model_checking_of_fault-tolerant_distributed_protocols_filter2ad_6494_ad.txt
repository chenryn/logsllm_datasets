### EVALUATION RESULTS

- **Tools Used**: Basset and MP-Basset
- **Environment**: DETERlab machines with Xeon processors and 4 GB of memory
- **Heuristics**: "Opposite transaction heuristic" was used for POR experiments.
- **Protocol Settings**: Selected to represent meaningful instances and feasible for model checking.
- **Transition Refinement**: Split models were created manually as MP-Basset does not support automation.

**Key Observations**:
- **Quorum Transitions**:
  - Reduced verification memory and time (up to 89% and 91% for regular storage with SPOR).
  - Smaller models and overall reduced verification time due to state space reduction.
- **Transition Refinement**:
  - Additional reduction in memory and time (up to 81% and 64% for Paxos).
  - Significant space reduction despite lower throughput.
- **Bug Detection**:
  - Fast bug detection using little memory, especially for deep bugs.

### BEHIND THE NUMBERS

- **Stateful vs. Stateless Search**:
  - Stateful search is beneficial for large state spaces.
  - Stateless search can be faster for smaller state spaces.
- **Effectiveness of Optimizations**:
  - Ineffective optimizations in certain state spaces lead to better results with less overhead.
  - Specific scenarios where split strategies are ineffective (e.g., single initiator or all receivers in a quorum).

### RELATED WORK

- **Formal Model**: Adapted from [4], similar to actor programs [1].
- **MP Language**: Shares commonalities with actor languages like ActorFoundry [19].
- **Quorum Transitions**: Similar to joint transitions of actors [14], but for mitigating state space explosion.
- **Simplifying Assumptions**: Synchrony and fail-silent faults [30], [11] can simplify protocol design and verification.
- **POR Work**: Focus on sound POR-conditions [15], [31], [12]. Operation refinement [15] is specific and not widely evaluated.
- **Model Checkers**: Promela (SPIN) supports message-passing, but MP-Basset and Basset implement more general POR algorithms.
- **Verification Tools**: MODIST [35], Crystalball [33], and symmetry reduction [7] are orthogonal techniques that can be combined.

### CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

- **Framework**: Efficient model checking of message-passing distributed protocols using quorum transitions and transition refinement.
- **Future Work**: Investigate the performance of reduction techniques in symbolic model checking, motivated by the suitability of certain POR methods for symbolic model checking.
