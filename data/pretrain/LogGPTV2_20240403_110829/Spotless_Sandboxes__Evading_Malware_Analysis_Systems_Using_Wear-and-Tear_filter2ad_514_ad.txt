### Construction of the Next Tree

The testing set was not provided to our algorithm during the training phase, in an attempt to quantify how well our model generalizes to previously unseen data. Our model achieved an accuracy of 92.86% on the testing set, with a false-negative rate (FNR) of 4.08% and a false-positive rate (FPR) of 10.20%. The ten constructed trees had an average tree size of 4.6 splits, with the shortest tree having 3 splits and the longest one having 5 splits. Table V presents the features that were most useful to the algorithm, along with the percentage of trees using each feature.

### Robustness Assessment

To assess the robustness of our algorithm against incremental changes in sandbox environments, we repeated the aforementioned experiment 30 times. In each iteration, we removed an additional feature from the original dataset and compiled new, randomly generated datasets. This process allowed us to evaluate the impact of feature removal on the model's performance.

### Visualization of Results

The following chart provides a visual representation of the results, showing the performance metrics and the importance of various features:

- **Accuracy**: 92.86%
- **False-Negative Rate (FNR)**: 4.08%
- **False-Positive Rate (FPR)**: 10.20%
- **Average Tree Size**: 4.6 splits
- **Shortest Tree**: 3 splits
- **Longest Tree**: 5 splits

### Feature Importance

Table V details the features that were most useful to the algorithm and the percentage of trees that utilized each feature. This information is crucial for understanding which features contribute significantly to the model's performance.

### Conclusion

The results indicate that our model performs well on unseen data, with a high accuracy rate and relatively low FNR and FPR. The robustness assessment further demonstrates the model's stability even when faced with incremental changes in the feature set. These findings suggest that our algorithm is both effective and reliable for the intended application.
