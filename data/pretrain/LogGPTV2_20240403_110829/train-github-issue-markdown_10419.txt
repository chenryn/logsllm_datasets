**Current behavior**  
Multiple @HostBinding decorators re not handled properly. Only last one is
used.
**Expected behavior**  
All decorators must be used
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
Create a component and set multiple HostBindings to single field, like:
    @Input()
    @HostBinding("style.width.px")
    @HostBinding("style.height.px")
    @HostBinding("style.min-width.px")
    @HostBinding("style.min-height.px")
    public size: number = 30;
Only last decorator is used when app is compiled, both in JIT and AoT.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Does not work as expected.
