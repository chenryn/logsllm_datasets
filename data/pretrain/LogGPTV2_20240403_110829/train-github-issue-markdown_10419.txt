### Current Behavior
When multiple `@HostBinding` decorators are applied to a single field, only the last decorator is recognized and used.

### Expected Behavior
All `@HostBinding` decorators should be correctly applied and used.

### Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions
To reproduce the issue, create a component and apply multiple `@HostBinding` decorators to a single field as shown below:

```typescript
import { Component, Input, HostBinding } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<div></div>'
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  @Input()
  @HostBinding("style.width.px")
  @HostBinding("style.height.px")
  @HostBinding("style.min-width.px")
  @HostBinding("style.min-height.px")
  public size: number = 30;
}
```

Only the last `@HostBinding` decorator is used when the application is compiled, both in JIT and AOT modes.

### Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior
The current behavior does not work as expected, and it limits the ability to apply multiple style bindings to a single property.

### Environment Details
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 16.04
- **Angular Version:** 2.3.0
- **Browsers:** All
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.0.10
- **Node (for AOT issues):** `node --version` = 4.2.6
