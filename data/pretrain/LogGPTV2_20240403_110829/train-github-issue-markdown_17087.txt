Atom will reload a file if no changes have been made but if you make changes
and then the file is updated by another person before you save there is no
indication that you are about to override someone else changes. This is
problematic when working on remote shares where a team can be editing the same
file. It would be nice if Atom would prompt you that the file was changed
outside of Atom and ask if you would like to reload the file.
