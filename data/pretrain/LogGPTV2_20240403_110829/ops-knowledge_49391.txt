**User:**

I have tried to install Enthought Canopy and followed the installation procedure. However, when I attempted to run `./canopy`, I encountered the following error:

```
Unable to load library icui18n: (icui18n: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)
```

Since I am using a supercomputing account provided by my university, I do not have sudo permissions. Could you please provide some advice on how to resolve this issue?

**Assistant:**

Thank you for reaching out, and I apologize for the delayed response. We are actively monitoring the `enthought` tag, so using it in your post will help us respond more quickly.

The warning message "Unable to load library icui18n" is known to be spurious and should not impact the functionality of Canopy. We have addressed this issue and turned off these warnings in version 1.2, which is scheduled for release during the first week of January.

If you continue to experience any other issues, please feel free to post again.
