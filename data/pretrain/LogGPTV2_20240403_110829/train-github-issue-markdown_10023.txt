When working with `themestrap` to create themes, I often find myself defining new variables for various hardcoded values in Bootstrap. Most frequently, these involve the `border-width` properties of numerous elements.

I'm curious about your thoughts on expanding the number of available variables, particularly in the context of `border-width`. If you are open to this idea, I would be happy to submit a Pull Request with the following approach:

1. Define a default border width and use it for multiple elements:
   ```scss
   @border-width-default: 1px;
   @hr-border-width: @border-width-default;
   // ... other elements ...
   ```

2. Inspired by the `@border-radius` declarations, we could also introduce different sizes for border widths:
   ```scss
   @border-width-default: 1px;
   @border-width-large: 3px;
   @hr-border-width: @border-width-default;
   @btn-border-width: @border-width-large;
   // ... other elements ...
   ```

This approach would provide more flexibility and consistency across the theme. Please let me know if you agree, and I will proceed with the Pull Request.
