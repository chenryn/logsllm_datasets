Subject: Assistance Needed with Proxy Configuration for Package Downloads

Dear Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am currently facing an issue with configuring the proxy settings, which is preventing me from downloading necessary packages. As I am working behind a corporate proxy, I require guidance on how to properly set up the proxy configuration in order to resolve this problem.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
