It seems in certain cases that a machine's environment will include an array.
We seem to see this when using Assetic to compile a less file with the less
compiler.

Offending line of code is here:
                $this->env = array();
                foreach ($env as $key => $value) {
                    $this->env[(binary) $key] = (binary) $value;
                }
The problem happens on the casting of $value to (binary).
I'll try to submit a patch.
(Note we were using Symfony 2.2, but it's probably in master as well)
