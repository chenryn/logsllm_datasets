User: Please briefly describe what is a database index, and provide an example of using an index to optimize query performance.
Assistant: A database index is a special data structure used to speed up the search of data in the database. Indexes are created in data tables, which can improve the efficiency of query operations and reduce the time and system resources required for queries. Common index types include primary key index, unique index, common index, etc. For example, suppose we have a student data table containing millions of records, and we need to find the information of a student, we can use the following SQL statement: SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_name='Tom'; If we create on the student data table For an ordinary index named "student_name", the optimized query statement is as follows: SELECT * FROM students USE INDEX(student_name) WHERE student_name='Tom'; By using the index, the query speed can be greatly improved and the consumption of system resources can be reduced.
