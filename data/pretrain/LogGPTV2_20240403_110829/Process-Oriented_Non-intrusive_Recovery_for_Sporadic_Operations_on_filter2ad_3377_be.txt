3)  Further  justification  of  the  generalizability  of  our  recovery  method  with  more  types  of 
sporadic operations on cloud. Apart from the five sporadic operations used for evaluation, other 
sporadic  operations  such  as  uninstallation  can  be  utilized  to  test  POD-Recovery  against  its 
generalizability as well as other recovery requirements. 
4)  Further  testing  of  POD-Recovery  on  other  public  cloud  platforms  and  tailoring  of  POD-
Recovery  for  private  cloud  platforms.  Other  public  cloud  platforms,  such  as  Windows  Azure 
and Google App Engine, are similar to AWS in terms of both cloud resource provisioning and 
log  information  generation,  so  additional  testing  on  other  public  clouds  can  be  conducted  to 
confirm POD-Recovery’s applicability to other public clouds. In addition, considering the fact 
that  some  companies  use  their  own  private  clouds  which  may  not  fully  satisfy  the  required 
assumptions of POD-Recovery, we can try to figure out a way to tailor POD-Recovery to cater 
for private clouds. 
5)  Exploration  of  more  cloud  benchmarking  tools.  Nowadays,  based  on  different  types  of 
business requirements and specifications, cloud applications within industries are no longer only 
limited to typical three-tier web applications. Hence, apart from the benchmarking tool of TPC-
W  which  is  representative  of  typical  three-tier  web  applications,  more  varieties  of  cloud 
benchmarking tools can be introduced to evaluate recovery actions. 
In  addition  to  the  above-mentioned  future  work,  there  are  some  other  open  questions  for  our 
future  work  as  well:  1)  to  which  degree  do  our  assumptions  and  conditions  hold  for  other 
domains such as non-cloud distributed systems; 2) how can the assumptions be relaxed so that 
non-intrusive recovery systems can be more broadly applied; 3) how to readjust and extend our 
recovery methodology to cater for  various and complex real business needs; 4) what potential 
research topics arise from the research findings of our research.
