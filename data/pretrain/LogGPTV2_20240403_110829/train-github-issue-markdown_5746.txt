I have this simple code:
    import * as React from "react";
    import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    ReactDOM.render(Hi, document.getElementById("root"));
that is giving me this error:
    Argument of type 'Element' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ReactElement[]'.
      Property 'length' is missing in type 'Element'.
I've currently tried these versions of react and react-dom:
    "react": "16.4.2",
    "react-dom": "16.4.2",
    "@types/react": "16.4.7",
    "@types/react-dom": "16.0.6",
and
    "react": "16.4.0",
    "react-dom": "16.4.0",
    "@types/react": "16.3.17",
    "@types/react-dom": "16.0.6",
I'd like to have react 16, but I'm not sure what the typing issue is here.
