I have the following simple React code:

```javascript
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(<div>Hi</div>, document.getElementById("root"));
```

This code is giving me the following error:

```
Argument of type 'Element' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ReactElement[]'.
  Property 'length' is missing in type 'Element'.
```

I have tried the following versions of `react`, `react-dom`, and their type definitions:

- `"react": "16.4.2",`
- `"react-dom": "16.4.2",`
- `"@types/react": "16.4.7",`
- `"@types/react-dom": "16.0.6"`

and

- `"react": "16.4.0",`
- `"react-dom": "16.4.0",`
- `"@types/react": "16.3.17",`
- `"@types/react-dom": "16.0.6"`

I would like to use React 16, but I am unsure what the typing issue is here.

### Explanation and Suggestion

The error you are encountering is due to the fact that `ReactDOM.render` expects a `ReactElement` or an array of `ReactElement`s, but you are passing a string literal `"Hi"` which is not a valid React element.

To fix this, you should wrap the string in a JSX element, such as a `<div>` or a `<span>`. Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(<div>Hi</div>, document.getElementById("root"));
```

This should resolve the typing issue and allow your code to run correctly with React 16.
