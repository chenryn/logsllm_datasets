Now that flask 2.0.0 has a `py.typed` file, the flask types are preferred over
the typeshed hints. When running mypy on my code, I now see errors like the
following:
     app.py:6: error: Module 'flask' does not explicitly export attribute 'Flask'; implicit reexport disabled
     app.py:6: error: Module 'flask' does not explicitly export attribute 'render_template'; implicit reexport disabled
     app.py:6: error: Module 'flask' does not explicitly export attribute 'request'; implicit reexport disabled
     app.py:6: error: Module 'flask' does not explicitly export attribute 'flash'; implicit reexport disabled
     app.py:6: error: Module 'flask' does not explicitly export attribute 'send_file'; implicit reexport disabled
In `flask/__init__.py` there are lines like this:
flask/src/flask/__init__.py
Line 7 in d575de5
|  from .app import Flask  
---|---  
However, mypy expects that these reexports should either have an `__all__` to
explicitly say which variables are being reexported, or to change the import
to `from .app import Flask as Flask`
In typeshed there is an example of how this was done before flask including
typing:

Environment:
  * Python version: 3.9
  * Flask version: 2.0.0
