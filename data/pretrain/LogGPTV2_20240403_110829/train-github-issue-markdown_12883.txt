The ParameterBag class is implemented in two components and has different
interfaces.
`Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\ParameterBag`  
`Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ParameterBag`
I can understand the duplication to avoid inter-module dependencies, but i do
not understand why the different interfaces. For example the Http version
allows default values:
    $bag->get('name', null)
Where the DI version does not and makes you do:
    $bag->has('name') ? $bag->get('name') : null
Could these be united? at least the interfaces? or is it a issue with
requirements?
