close inspection of the heatmaps shows that the weekend diﬀerences are strongest
on Sundays. Figure 6 in the appendix contains similar heatmaps using a Sunday
as the reference day, and shows the expected inverted pattern of a greater diﬀer-
ence during the workweek, and less during the weekend, relative to the Sunday
list. Umbrella has the strongest weekend eﬀect, with changes occurring even in
the top 10. For example, Table 4 in the appendix shows that Netﬂix moves from
ranks two and three to one and two, and Hola appears with two new entries.
Majestic, shown in Fig. 7 in the appendix, has no discernible weekend eﬀect, as
its ranks appear stable.

3.2 The Weekend Eﬀect
Alexa and Umbrella exhibit strong, temporary changes each weekend. Using
domain extensions and website categories, we quantify how this aﬀects the type
of listed domains.
Domain Extensions. To judge how the lists represent diﬀerent geographical
regions, we look at country-code domain extensions, or more precisely, public
suﬃxes. The public suﬃx of a domain is the domain extension under which
domains can be registered, such as .cl or .co.uk. Country-code domain exten-
sions are only a coarse-grained approximation of country-level popularity, as
many regions use generic top-level domains such as .com in addition to their
country-code domain, and the U.S. in particular makes comparatively little use
of their .us extension. However, the way how each region splits its traﬃc across
generic and country-code domains should be stable, which means that we can
use domain extensions to uncover weekday to weekend changes.
Figure 2 shows the most common public suﬃxes used in Alexa and Umbrella
on Wednesdays from February to May 2018, ordered by their mean market share.
Diﬀerent list intervals often exhibit variation in the relative popularity of domain
extensions. For example, .jp is the sixth most frequent extension in Alexa’s
top 100k, whereas it is ranked twenty-fourth in the full list. Extension diversity
diﬀers between the lists, with Alexa containing 33 extensions in the top 100,
Majestic 13, and Umbrella only 4.
The weekend eﬀect aﬀects the geographical diversity of Alexa and Umbrella.
On weekends, Alexa loses domains from European countries and gains in Russia,
India, and for .com (from mean of 47.0 to 48.1%); Umbrella also includes more
Russian domains, and more domains with invalid extensions, but has fewer .com
domains (from 57.1 to 53.4% in the full list). Only Majestic remains relatively
stable, most likely due to its ranking reﬂecting structural properties of a website
link graph and not visitor popularity.
Invalid Domains. All of the domains in Alexa use a well-known public suf-
ﬁx, but a mean of 0.5% (Wednesday) and 1.6% (Sunday) of Umbrella domains
and 0.004% of Majestic domains have a non-delegated domain extension. Such
168
W. Rweyemamu et al.
domains cannot currently be registered or resolved on the public Internet. In
fact, Umbrella appears to contain domains used internally in corporate networks.
These domains can appear quite high in the ranking, such as the domain tcs at
rank 820. Table 3 shows the ﬁve most frequently used invalid domain extensions
in Umbrella. Each Wednesday, Umbrella contains a mean of 18 domains with the
localhost extension, the highest of which was observed at rank 18,583, while
each Sunday, localhost contains a mean of 7,852 domain with a best rank of
11,829. This trend is consistent with other invalid domains, showing that invalid
domains peak on the weekend. The list also contains a mean of 198 corp domains,
and entries corresponding to the names of networking equipment manufacturers
such as belkin and dlink. Chen et al. [11,12] describe how internal domain
name lookups can leak into the public Internet, where they are susceptible to
attacks.
Website Categories. Similar to country-level representations, the lists may
exhibit diﬀerences in the content-level types of domains they contain. We utilise
Symantec/BlueCoat WebPulse [8] to categorise the top 10k domains of each list,
assuming that they are websites. For subdomains, the category usually refers to
the registered parent domain.
We successfully retrieve categories for 97.8–98.3% of domains in the top 10k
from March and April 2018. Domains listed in Alexa and Majestic are classiﬁed
into 63 and 62 categories, respectively, whereas Umbrella covers only 53 distinct
categories. This eﬀect is even more pronounced in the top 1k, where Alexa con-
tains 48 categories, Majestic 39, and Umbrella only 23. Umbrella contains many
subdomains [20,30], which results in a signiﬁcantly less diverse set of websites.
Figure 3 shows the most frequent categories ordered by their Wednesday market
share. The category market share distribution in Alexa is much more balanced
than in Umbrella, resulting in a better representation of websites of diﬀerent
categories.
The types of categories also diﬀer between the lists. The Wednesday Alexa
in the interval 100–1k contains 7.5% websites that could be considered “unsafe
for work” environments, whereas in Umbrella, the percentage is only 0.2%. This
suggests that the Umbrella ranking may be based on a larger share of corporate
traﬃc. Similarly, while the News/Media category is ranked ﬁrst in Sunday Alexa,
it appears at rank 12 in Umbrella. In contrast, Umbrella highly ranks several
categories that appear to apply to internal subdomains and subresources such
as Web Ads/Analytics, the highest ranked category at (38.4% Wed.), as well as
Content Servers (7.7% Wed.) and Non-Viewable/Infrastructure (4.0% Wed.). For
comparison, in the Alexa top 1k, the former categories account for only 2.8%
and 0.5%, respectively, and the latter category does not appear. This further
illustrates the eﬀects of Umbrella’s subdomain inclusion.
From the weekdays to the weekend, Alexa and Umbrella both lose in business-
related categories and gain in various forms of entertainment. In the Umbrella
interval 100–1 k, the Business/Economy category loses 1.1 percentage points,
whereas the Chat category gains 0.9 percentage points; Games increase their mar-
