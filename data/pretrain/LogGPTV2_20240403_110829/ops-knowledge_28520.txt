User: I have mac os x, recently I have install python version 3.2 before I had version 2.6.1. but when I type "python" in terminal it prints Python 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:49). what does it mean? how can I use python 3.2 that have install this week?
Assistant: instead of using python I typed python3 in terminal and it was the solution
