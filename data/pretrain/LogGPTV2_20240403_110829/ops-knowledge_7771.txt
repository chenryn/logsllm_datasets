Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system exchanging data blocks of size 67108864. The DataNode component is receiving blocks from various sources and the FSNamesystem component is updating the blockMap with the source and size of the blocks. The PacketResponder components are terminating after the data blocks have been received.
