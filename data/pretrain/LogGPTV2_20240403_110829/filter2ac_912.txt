**Title: Cloudy with a Chance of APT: Novel Microsoft 365 Attacks in the Wild**

Over the past year, it has become evident that advanced, nation-state-backed threat actors are increasingly dedicating time and resources to develop innovative methods for accessing cloud environments. These actors are particularly focused on Microsoft 365, where many organizations store and collaborate on some of their most sensitive data. For threat groups with intelligence collection requirements, Microsoft 365 can be a prime target.

In this talk, we will dissect several novel techniques that APT groups have employed over the past year to gain persistent access to Microsoft 365 and exfiltrate data. We will delve into the technical foundations that are crucial for understanding and identifying these tactics. Additionally, we will explore potential extensions or new facets of these techniques that, while not yet observed or discussed, represent natural evolutions that organizations should be prepared to address.
