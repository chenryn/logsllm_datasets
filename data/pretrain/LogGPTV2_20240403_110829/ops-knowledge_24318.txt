User: I've just completed the very very nice django tutorial and it all went swimmingly. One of the first parts of the tutorial is that it says not to use their example server thingie in production, my first act after the tutorial was thus to try to run my app on apache.
I'm running OSX 10.5 and have the standard apache (which refuses to run python) and MAMP (which begrudgingly allows it in cgi-bin). The problem is that I've no idea which script to call, in the tutorial it was always localhost:8000/polls but I've no idea how that's meant to map to a specific file.
Have I missed something blatantly obvious about what to do with a .htaccess file or does the tutorial not actually explain how to use it somewhere else?
Assistant: Yet another option is to consider using a virtual machine for your development. You can install a full version of whatever OS your production server will be running - say, Debian - and run your Apache and DB in the VM.
You can connect to the virtual disk in the Finder, so you can still use TextMate (or whatever) on OSX to do your editing.
I've had good experiences doing this via VMWare Fusion.
