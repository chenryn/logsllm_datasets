I have a project at the moment that uses nextjs embedded in an express server.
I have a page called `event.js` and I route `/event/:eventId` to
`/event?eventId={id}`.
My issue now is that if the user goes to `/event` without specifying an ID my
page component is rendered anyway.
My suggestion is: Allow `getInitialProps` function to return `null` (or
`false` or `404` or `new Error("")`), which will result in next intercepting
this and rendering the 404 page.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Current Setup
    expressApp.get('/event/:eventId', (req, res) => {
      const mapToUrl = '/event'
      const query = {
        ...req.query,
        eventId: req.params.eventId
      }
      nextApp.render(req, res, mapToUrl, query)
    })
    expressApp.get('*', nextHandler)
