Interview with David MacMichael – February 13, 2006
by Richard Thieme
David MacMichael is a former CIA Analyst, US Marine and historian.  He was a senior
estimates officer with special responsibility for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the CIA's
National Intelligence Council from 1981 to 1983. He resigned from the CIA rather than
falsify reports for political reasons and testified at the World Court on the illegalities of
Iran-Contra.  
MacMichael started The Association of National Security Alumni, an organization to
expose and curtail covert actions, and is a steering committee member of Veteran
Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS).
He and Richard Thieme, a frequent contributor to NCR, recently met at an Intelligence
Ethics Conference that gathered nearly two hundred professionals from a broad spectrum
of perspectives to discuss the impact of a career in intelligence on the moral and ethical
life of the intelligence professional. 
MacMichael discusses his background, ethical issues in intelligence, and the relevance of
Iran-Contra to current national security issues. 
RT: David, we discussed technology and the intelligence community—
DM: That’s a term I hate! It sounds so warm and fuzzy.
RT: What do you prefer?
DM: Intelligence system.
RT: OK. Technology and the intelligence system. 
DM: For years I worked at SRI (Stanford Research Institute) and Uri Geller and people
like that were always floating through. I was supposed to be a voice of sanity but they did
get me thinking about certain things that show up in your piece on technology
(MacMichael reviewed my essay, The Changing Context of Intelligence and Ethics:
Enabling Technologies as Transformational Engines) and what is happening there in the
intelligence community. Jacques Ellul wrote of how technology defines the way the
world operates and if it has an evil purpose or one that is wrong by previous standards, it
will be used anyway. 
I was a history professor, and I think of Diderot in the 18th century France. The
Encyclopedia was really a technical manual that exposed what had previously been
referred to as “the mysteries” of the craft guilds. Transforming mystery into knowledge
became a basis for the industrial revolution. That kind of change is significant and
impacts the issues you raise on the ethical side about the intelligence system. 
Which brings me to an important question: What has all of that got to do with
“intelligence?” I think of all the crazy science they did in MKULTRA and MKSEARCH
and programs like that.  How did that relate to gathering intelligence in order to inform
policies? 
Another point you make is that transformation imposed by global multi-national
corporations that transcend all national boundaries make the concept of nation states in
conflict highly questionable. In the 19th and 20th centuries, conflicts were between nation
states. But even so, you can go back through any historical atlas and look at the post-
Roman empire and it’s like a kaleidoscope as you turn through the maps as the borders
and shapes of geographical structures change. 
RT: The maps in people’s minds are more permanent than the territories represented by
the maps. Now neuro-science is mapping regions of the brain-
DM: Yes, and from Ellul’s perspective, that translates into control. Control is what
programs like MK Ultra were about and that raises critical ethical issues.
I worked at Stanford with Harvey Weinstein a psychiatrist who headed student
psychiatric services for the university. Harvey became a psychiatrist because his father
was a victim of MKULTRA experimentation. His father deteriorated into depression and
worse as a consequence of Ewen Cameron’s crazy science, but the family was told his
father was going through this because he was not sufficiently cooperative with his
treatment. That pushed Harvey into psychiatry. In the late seventies, after the revelations
of the Church and Pike Committee hearings, he became aware of the real causes. 
Why are those devastating techniques lumped in with intelligence at all? That goes to the
more basic question of why are intelligence and covert operations lumped together?
Intelligence is about information. The rule of thumb for covert operations is that there is
75% disinformation. The ethical issues are difficult to reconcile. One is based on truth
and other on its opposite. 
RT: Friends in one of the agencies complain of the hubris that blinds people inside to a
sense of accountability toward the people i.e. citizens like us, who pay their salaries.
Disinformation coming out of the agencies directed toward enemies can not be
distinguished from disinformation directed toward the population. In addition,
propaganda is impossible to protect from blowback because of network of the
information systems we all inhabit. How do we seek the larger truth and articulate it in
order to inform responsible policy discussions. Is it even possible?
DM: I like to go back before the Neocons with their Machiavellian intellectual base and
quote Walter Lippman who made the same point. Matters of foreign affairs and
international policy are too far beyond the ability of the populace to understand, he said,
so they have to be conducted in secret and there must be no transparency. 
RT: Tell me more about your background. 
DM: I was not a professional intelligence officer. I had ten years in the US Marine Corps,
resigned my commission in 1959, and went back to grad school. I was an NDEA fellow
at the U of Oregon and received advanced degrees in history. I taught for a few years and
because of my military background and because I specialized in military history with a
focus on Latin America I was contacted by SRI which had a lot of DOD contracts.
Counter insurgency was the new thing. In the Corps, I went to Special Forces School. We
always prepare for the last war and the whole focus was to repeat the OSS experience in
the event of war with the Soviet Union. Special Forces was created because the military
never wanted to see anything like OSS again. The plan was, teams would go into eastern
Europe to create insurgencies, but in a few years it became obvious that the insurgencies
in the colonies of post-war allies had to be “countered” – so counter insurgency was
developed. DOD was letting contracts like crazy. SRI hired me to go to Central America
and do classified work. They had gotten a big contract from ARPA (later DARPA) for a
counter insurgency center in Thailand and I worked on that. 
There was a battle going on in Thailand between the Ambassador Graham Martin and
military advisors headed by Richard Stillwell. They were battling for control of our major
aid programs which had to be justified in terms of security. Martin and Stillwell hated
each other so the White House of course chose someone who hated both of them and was
hated by them, Peer De Silva, who wrote a memoir ( Sub Rosa: The CIA and the Uses of
Intelligence. New York: New York Times Books, 1978). He was security officer on the
Manhattan Project and transferred into the new CIA. 
He was restricted in terms of how many people he could take to Thailand so he had to
staff from what was there. My colleague. John Huxley, had been station chief in Pakistan,
and told him to get me and I worked for him for four years in the US Embassy. That
where I made my contacts with the agency and the branch office of the station and when I
returned to the USA I did contract work for them. Then, as a consultant, I worked with
John Nesbitt the technologist during the last years of Stan Turner’s control of the agency,
when they were trying to reconstruct the old Board of National Estimates type of
operation. 
They wanted outside people with background and reputation to head the Analytic Group
at the National Intelligence Council to be responsible for writing national intelligence
estimates. I went to work for Harold Ford. I was responsible for western hemisphere
estimates along with another and the focus came to be on the Contra war. 
I was diligent. No matter who I talked to, who I pumped, I was unable to come up with
anything in support of the main rationale for the Contra operation. I had serious problems
with the characterization of the Sandinista government. 
This tells you how the system actually works. This is relevant to what’s happening now. I
was asked to do an estimate on the Sandinista government and I did an assessment and a
projection which all came true but did not fit the policy makers’ desires. That’s why it
resonates with the WMD controversy. Ford backed me up but William Casey (Director of
the CIA) said no, this can not go out as a special estimate. It was published as an
intelligence research memorandum and went into the file and that was that. 
After two years with the analytic group, I could not continue. I did not want anything else
in the agency. Instead I traveled at my own expense in Central America and the more I
learned the more clear it became that the operation was whacko. If I was going to speak
out I had better do it because I knew of well developed US plans for an invasion of
Nicaragua. I was well aware of what we had done elsewhere and if I was going to speak
out it should be before the fact instead of after. 
At the 1985 elections in Nicaragua, I was an observer; it was going to be verified as a fair
and open election but right before the election – this is how disinformation is fed to the
press – news was broken that Nicaragua was going to receive a big shipment of MIG
aircraft.
RT: Was the relationship between the CIA and the media as subtle then as it is now?
DM: It was very subtle over that entire long period. The operational role of opinion
control came directly out of the Second World War. It applies to any war time situation;
war requires you to enlist the media to push in the best sense of the word war
propaganda. This is what you want out, and you’re part of the war effort, you’re
supporting your country, and in the Cold War, the same rationale was invoked. You have
to understand that many people were involved who had been intellectually attracted to an
alternative of what was seen as destructive and failed capitalism and were working with
the Communist Party and were then disillusioned by events in eastern Europe. They were
brought in and did this in the momentum of World War 2. They believed they were
supporting our country and you had to conceal their activity—now this is very powerful,
this idea of being on the inside of that effort, it is so attractive, so powerful. A big threat
to any who wanted to speak up was that you would lose access, and you want so much to
be on the inside. This keeps many people in the intelligence system, besides the usual
reasons like salary, pension, and the like. They’re afraid that if they speak up, they will
lose their access.
RT: Shunning is a primitive and powerful reinforcement.
DM: You’ll see this in the hearings coming up on whistle blowers. I know many of these
people and what fractures a lot of them and makes them so upset is that when they raise
concerns, not so much about policy but about the way it is carried out, they lose their
security clearance. You have to understand how critical this is. It means everything to a
person. Everything.
RT: The consequences are so serious. 
DM: Oh, they are. I know prominent whistle blowers who still deal with this after many
years. “These were my colleagues,” they say. “These were my friends. But suddenly I am
not a colleague or a friend.” It’s like the clubbiness of the Foreign Service; when you’re
no longer welcome at certain parties or in certain houses, it’s a serious blow.
Now, I had gotten some good press and I hired a lawyer, Melvin Wolfe, who was chief
counsel of the ACLU and had worked with Victor Marchetti on publishing his CIA
memoirs. I did not want to be prosecuted and I did not wish to go to jail. Mel said he
would be able to defend me. I reviewed the form I had signed with the agency. The story
was going to go out and I gave Wolfe a magazine article I wanted to publish in which I
said everything I felt I had to say as well as some things I was certain they would block. I
said, Mel, take this to the publications review board at the agency –and it worked out
exactly as I anticipated. They passed through what I believed was necessary for me to
say, who I was, the critical evidence, and blocked out the other stuff which I was certain
they would not let me say. Now I had a guideline for the rest of the eighties, for speaking
and helping to organize the Association of National Security Alumni. I used that action as
my guideline. Occasionally Wolfe would check – there was a lot of surveillance on me as
well—and the word he got was, that son of a bitch keeps going right up to the line but he
never goes over.
