Sampling using the sample() function does not work for DPGMM (Dirichlet
Process Gaussian Mixture Mode) and VBGMM (Variational inference for a Gaussian
mixture model )
        398                     cv = self.covars_[comp][0]
        399                 else:
    --> 400                     cv = self.covars_[comp]
        401                 X[comp_in_X] = sample_gaussian(
        402                     self.means_[comp], cv, self.covariance_type,
    AttributeError: 'VBGMM' object has no attribute 'covars_'
Likely related to #1637, but that activity has been over a year ago.
is there a potential workaround?
