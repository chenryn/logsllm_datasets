TSCM
Time Domain Reflectometer
Time Domain Reflectometry is the analysis of a conductor (wire, cable, or fiber optic) by
sending a pulsed signal into the conductor, and then examining the reflection of that
pulse.
By examining the polarity, amplitude, frequencies and other electrical signatures of all
reflections; tampering or bugs may be precisely located.
Any device or wire attached will cause a detectable anomaly, the TSCM technician will
then perform a physical inspection at the location of the anomaly.
TDR analysis will usually NOT detect capacitively isolated devices or inductive taps. In
the case of capacitively isolated device or inductive tap, the TDR sweep is always
supplemented by a detailed high frequency cross talk evaluation and a detailed physical
inspection.

The delay between the initial pulse and the reflected pulse indicate the length of the cable
(or the location of an anomaly). The delay is divide by the speed of light, and multiplied by
the proper velocity of propagation (based on the capacitance of one foot of cable), and then
divide the result by two. On a ten mile section of cable a resolution of one tenth of an inch or
better is typical (512,000 point TDR).

NearField Detector
A NearField Detector is designed to detect low level radio frequency (RF) radiation
from transmitters, receivers, computers, etc. One of the two antennas detects
towards positive while the other detects towards negative, therefore, if the source of RF
energy is away from the two antennas (i.e. 20 feet or more) both antennas receive
essentially the same amount of energy and the meter remains at zero. As the ratio of the
distance between the RF source and the antennas decreases, one antenna receives
more RF than the other and the meter swings on that direction. This effect is known as
near field or differential detection.

NearField Detector
2055HA - NEAR FIELD RF DETECTOR/DIFFERENTIAL RF PROBE (MK IV)
This differential antenna detector covers from 10 to over 1,000 MHz and solves many of
the problems encountered in very high level signal locations such as metropolitan areas.
The level of radio frequency (RF) radiation from computers and other electronic
equipment can also be observed with this unit. Supplied with amplifier/indicator
assembly, RF head, two antennas, head extension rods and cables, special 2,000 ohm
headset and carrying case. Uses two 9-volt batteries and incorporates internal battery
test circuits.
The 2055HA covers frequencies ranging from lower than 10,000 Hz (10 Khz) to over
1,000 MHz or 1 GHz. The system consists of: amplifier/indicator assembly, RF head
assembly, head extension rods, head extension cable, two multi-section antennas, two
right angle BNC connectors, special 2,000 ohm headset, carrying case and instructions.

NEARFIELD DETECTORS
TO OPERATE: Insert the RF head assembly into the BNC connector on the top of the amplifier/indicator assembly and position so
the two cover screws face the operator. Connect the two antennas with right angle adapters to the RF head and position so they are
parallel. If the frequency of interest it above 500 MHz, collapse both antennas fully. For frequencies between 100 and 500 MHz,
extend both antennas one section. For frequencies below 100 MHz extend both antennas two sections.
Insert the 2K ohm headset supplied into the HEADSET-2K jack. Do NOT use a low impedance headset (it simply won't work). The
headset is worn with the gray stethoscope tube under the chin and the sound output holes facing slightly forward (roughly 30 degrees)
or with the ear hook. Turn the unit ON and place the TONE/AUDIO switch in the TONE position. Zero the Meter with the ZERO SET
control at the top of the unit. press the + BATTERY Test button. The meter will swing to the right and a reading in excess of + .8
indicates satisfactory battery conditions Pressing the - button causes the meter to swing to the left and again, a reading in excess of -
.8 indicates a satisfactory battery condition.
Pass the antennas over the test areas If a source is located, the Meter will swing in the direction of the source and pass through zero
when the source is perpendicular to the two antennas. Since the tone heard through the headset has a pitch proportional to the meter
readings it is not necessary to observe the meter while searching for the source.
The lowest pitch tone indicator zero and the tone increases in pitch on either side of zero. The RF head can be extended with the
extension handles and cable. Plug the cable BNC connector into the BNC jack at the bottom of the RF head. Plug the mini-plug into
the jack located to the left of the BNC plug on the amplifier/indicator assembly.

NearField Detector
The 2055HA say also be used as a single antenna RF detector by removing the left antenna and zeroing the unit. The meter will
swing only to the right when a source is located If the meter goes beyond full scale to the right, the zero may be suppressed to the
left of center as required. The TONE/AUDIO switch causes either a tone proportional to the meter reading (TONE) or demodulated
AM audio (AUDIO) to occur at the headset. the DC output of the op-amp is accessible through the RECORDER jack. This output is
designed to drive a strip chart recorder.
Should either battery become weak (i.e. below .8), replace both batteries by removing the top and bottom screws from the amplifier/
indicator assembly and carefully lifting off the back cover. Alkaline batteries are always preferred. While the back cover is off, note
the three screw-driver adjust potentiometers The one in the upper center above the upper integrated circuit is the rough zero. The
control to the right (as viewed from the back) of the integrated circuit is the gain control, The control below and slightly to the right of
the gain control is the base tone adjustments To re-enter the position of the ZERO SET control, set that control to mid-range and
adjust the rough zero control for zero indication on the Deter. To adjust the base tone, zero the meter and set this control for a tone
output of roughly 5 to 20 Hz. As with any piece of electronic equipment, remove the batteries during periods of prolonged storage.

Non-Linear Junction Detector
Back in the early 70's a method was developed to detect eavesdropping devices though the analysis of harmonic
emissions caused by an illuminating signal when it is reflected off of a target. A few years later this
method was used by the Super scout NLJD system (which was the first commercially available and patented NLJD).
Semiconductors contain multiple layers of silicon, a P-Type and an N-Type, the point where they meet is
called a Non Linear Junction. This junction also appears in nature when dissimilar metals come in contact
with one another (such as that used in the old crystal radio set). Also, the rust on a screw, the springs in
a car, or the support structure in any piece of furniture may also contain non linear junctions (resulting
from corrosion).
A Non Linear Junction Detector finds potential eavesdropping devices by flooding a suspect area or target
with a spectrally pure microwave RF signal (usually around 888 or 915 MHz). Various frequencies are then
monitored for a reflected harmonic signal.
The instrument typically has an antenna and a control unit. The antenna is mounted on an extendable pole, and
really nothing more than a microwave waveguide which both emit and collects the signals (with a duplexer).
The control unit is usually a multiple channel, highly sensitive radio receiver tuned to specific second, and
third harmonic frequencies. While it is possible to measure the 4th, 5th, 6th, and other harmonics those
above the third are only of limited TSCM value.

Power Level Issues
Non Linear Junction Detectors are available in a variety of power outputs ranging from the "civilian" version
with an output below 25 mW, to the restricted Government version with a power output over 2 watts ERP. The
Soviet and Chinese government actually use NLJD instruments which generate hundreds of watts of power, but
often cost the TSCM specialist their vision (and other soft tissue damage) due to high levels of non-ionizing
radiation. On an added note a NLJD should not be directed to any human or other living creature due to the
potential of serious bodily harm. You can actually knock out a cardiac patients pacemaker from a distance
with one, or cause serious soft tissue damage such as cornea injury, loss of hearing, kidney failure, and so
on. As the power output increases the greater the range of the unit, and the penetration into solid materials.
As the power level increases, the sensitivity of the unit will decrease.
Normally a 2 Watt NLJD will detect an eavesdropping device through several inches of concrete, inside a wall,
or buried deep inside a couch. The lower power units (50-100 mW) on the other hand will only detect
eavesdropping devices inside a book, or devices only an inch or so away from the antenna (such as behind a
few layers of sheetrock).  Non Linear Junction Detector transmit power is relatively meaningless. The sensitivity and bandwidth of the
receiver is a far more important issue. Cheap units use high power to overcome poor receiver sensitivity and
poor noise figures. In general the better units (more effective) are the lower powered ones.
Much like an X-ray the power level must be variable based on the density of the object being inspected. Of
course the more power you generate the more "alerting" your activities become, and the higher the risk of
personal injury (just like taking an X-Ray).  Generally a 1.5 Watt ERP unit with a variable output (adjustable down to around 5 mW
ERP) works well, but if you use Digital Signal Processing or DSP in the unit to increase sensitivity the power levels can be drop to
well below a Watt.

Spectrum Analyzer
A good Digital Spectrum Analyzer is the "workhorse" of the TSCM industry.
When coupled with a computer, printer, and vector signal analyzer will detect virtually
any RF eavesdropping device made (including the ones used by the FBI, NSA, CIA,
SVR, CSE, MI5, GCHQ, etc).

Spectrum Analyzer
The Tektronix 494A/P and 497A/P Spectrum Analyzer are the more recent additions to
the 490 family. They include better frequency stability, markers, and better programming
functions. Typical frequency of the 494A/P is from 10 kHz to 22 GHz, external mixers will
increase the range to 40 GHz (or 325 GHz). The 497A/P model has operations similar to
the 494 but the frequency coverage is limited to 100 Hz to 7.1 GHz.  The 490 series has
since been replaced by the FSE series out of Germany. Used instruments are commonly
available for around $25,000 for a 494A/P, and $15,000 for the 497A/P. The 494A/P is
the only spectrum analyzer in the Tektronix 490 family that ever saw wide spread usage
in the TSCM industry. The 494 A/P version was fairly popular with all U.S. government
agencies performing TSCM. The units are fairly easy to operate, lightweight, but
temperamental when "bumped around".  When used with an external demodulator the
494A/P becomes an excellent instrument for TSCM teams who travel heavily and are
unable to transport a lab grade instrument.

Oscilloscopes
All TSCM teams should have at least two Digital Storage Oscilloscopes, one
should be a rugged hand held unit, and the other should be a lab grade unit with a
1 GHz bandwidth. Al least one unit should be computer controllable, and should be
capable of direct postscript printing or computer control.  The units most commonly
found in the TSCM industry are the Tektronix TDS784 and the THS720 Digital
Oscilloscopes, along with the Fluke 190 series. Both units are fully computer controllable,
rugged, and designed to take years of abuse.  DocuWave software and a PC should be
used to control the scopes and store traces and data.  The TDS784 offers 4 channels
with a digitizing rate of 1GS/s (1 Billion samples per second) and work well for high
resolution TDR work.  When used to monitor the wideband output of a search receiver
signals identification is made considerably easier.  The THS720 Digital Oscilloscope
offers 2 channels with a digitizing rate of 500 MS /s (500 Million samples per second). It
comes in a small handheld case, and works well in the field, an excellent piece of
equipment.
