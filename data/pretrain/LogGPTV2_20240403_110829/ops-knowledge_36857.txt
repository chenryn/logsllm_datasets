Could someone please tell me what these errors mean. Or at least tell me how to disable these errors. It is realy anoying when I am working over ssh and these errors keep popping up all over my screen.

Assistant: While the other answers are correct in elimiating the error message you got, consider that this error message may just be a symptom of another underlying problem.

You get these messages because there are many failing login attempts via ssh on your system. There may be someone trying to brute-force into your box (was the case when I got the same messages on my system). Read your var/log/auth.log for research...

If this is the case, you shoud consider installing a tool like 'fail2ban' (sudo apt-get install fail2ban on Ubuntu). It automatically reads the log files of your system, searches for multiple failed login attempts and blocks the malicious clients for a configurable time via iptables...
