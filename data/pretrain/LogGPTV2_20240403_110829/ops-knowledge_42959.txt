User: I have a script that will pull files from two directories back, so the script resides at:

/folder2/folder1/folder0/script.py

and the files that will be processed will be in folder2.
I can get back one level with "..//" (I'm making a Windows executable with cx_free) but I'm thinking this isn't the best way to do this.
I am setting an input directory and an output directory. I want to keep the paths relative to the location of the script so that "folder2" can be moved without screwing up the functionality of the script or force rewriting of it.
thanks
Assistant: I would use your suggested method of os.chdir(r'..\..') to make sure your current working directory is in folder2. I'm not really sure what you're asking though, so maybe clarify why you think this ISN'T the right solution?
