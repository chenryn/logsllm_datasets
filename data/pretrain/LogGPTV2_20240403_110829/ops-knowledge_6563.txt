User: Our application has encountered a network security problem, please provide some methods to defend against DDoS attacks.
Assistant: The following are some methods of defending against DDoS attacks: 1. In terms of network architecture design: divide the network into multiple modules, and set up protection for each module independently, while ensuring that the traffic between modules does not conflict. 2. Network protocol level: use IP filter, HTTP protocol analysis and URL redirection, SSL protocol, etc. 3. Hardware: Use advanced network switches, firewall software, load balancers, security routers, Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and other hardware devices to provide defense mechanisms. 4. Software: use behavior-based intrusion detection technology (Behavior-based Intrusion Detection) and intrusion prevention system (Intrusion Prevention System); real-time monitoring of attack source and attack type. 5. In terms of network-wide parameter adjustment: adjust TCP/IP protocol parameters, increase the size of network stacking buffers, set UDP security, and control network-wide traffic capacity, etc. 6. In terms of comprehensive backup: back up in multiple places so that the system data can be restored as much as possible. 7. Manual countermeasures: use behavior-based intrusion detection technology (Behavior-based Intrusion Detection) and intrusion prevention system (Intrusion Prevention System) to check the source of the attack, and strengthen user education to enhance user security awareness.
