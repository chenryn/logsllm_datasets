root cause of security incidents.
In our work, we investigated the potential technical and non-
technical issues of SOCs in a more comprehensive manner. Further-
more, we explored manager-based and analyst-based perspectives
toward issues and their mitigation by crafting role-specific ques-
tions. In our study, we identified several issues that we consider to
be critical for SOCs and the overall security posture of organiza-
tions.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive qualitative study of
SOCs and discovered issues in SOCs. Furthermore, we identified the
issues that managers and analysts agree and disagree on, and we
proposed advice as well as research opportunities that will improve
SOCs.
We believe that our findings will encourage SOC professionals
to develop an understanding of each other and put aside their dif-
ferences. We also believe that this work provides a path forward for
future research in this area, bridging the gap between the academic
research community and the real-world needs of SOCs.

B MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS AND ISSUES
For completeness, we provide the remaining parts of our interview
data.
B.1 SOC Operations and Scope of Protection
Three of our participants, P4, P9, and P12, stated that all SOC oper-
ations are tied to each other and have equal criticality. They stated
that if any operation fails, other operations would also fail. How-
ever, others argued that some operations are more important than
others. These include monitoring, incident management, the cy-
cle of prevention, detection and response, and being proactive in
which the incidents are aimed to be prevented before they happen
instead of being reactive in which incidents are mitigated after they
happen.
Regarding protection, the consensus among participants was that
all the entities and parts of the SOC have equal importance when
protection is concerned. When the interviewer asked participants
to name specific parts, participants mentioned the organization’s
assets, the corporate network and infrastructure, end-points on the
corporate network, and end-users.
However, one of our participants, P12, pointed out that they
focus on the most-viable products and high-risk users as a priority.
B.2 Low SOC Maturity
As time pass by, SOCs mature and get stable. Tools that create too
many false positives are tuned, employees get experienced, reports
get polished, and many more refinements occur. However, this
process tends to be very slow, and it takes years for a SOC to have
a high level of maturity.
On a scale of 5, 5 being the highest, more than half of our partici-
pants rated their SOC’s maturity level as 4 and higher. Furthermore,
P10 and P11 mentioned that they had a recent maturity assessment
in which they scored fairly mature. The rest of our participants
who rated their maturity low provided reasons as follows: SOC
being established within the last couple of years, having varying
maturity levels across the board, recent staff changes, and ineffi-
cient communication and collaboration between various teams in
the organization. Regarding collaboration and communication, P13
stated that their SOC’s maturity is great from the talents perspec-
tive but added suggestions to improve maturity level and a relating
concern about their current situation. She said:
... better integration within the other security teams, better
holistic ticketing and reporting because, at the moment, our
SOC and people who are actually monitoring and detecting
the activities use a separate system than the people who are
responding to those activities.
The participant believes that these suggestions would signifi-
cantly improve the maturity of the SOC and stated that they are
currently working on improving their maturity.
rity staff.
B.3 The Magic Wand that Comes to the Rescue
If provided with a magic wand, participants stated that they would:
• Have more eyes looking for incidents by having more secu-
• Keep the employees trained.
• Make political issues between groups in their organization
• Create a well-designed ticketing system that would have
smooth integration with the currently available tool-sets.
• Assign an unlimited budget to their organization’s SOC.
• Put more structure in alert pre-testing before they roll into
• Improve their SOC’s poor visibility.
