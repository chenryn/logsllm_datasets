User:  How to configure Nginx to handle HTTPS requests?
Assistant: To configure Nginx to handle HTTPS requests, follow these steps: 1. Install an SSL certificate on the server. This is available through various certificate authorities or self-signed certificates. 2. Confirm whether the ngx_http_ssl_module module has been installed in Nginx. If not, recompile with the following command: ``` ./configure --with-http_ssl_module make sudo make install ``` 3. Open the Nginx configuration file and add the following: ``` # HTTPS server server { listen 443; Server_name Example.com; # SSL SSL_Certificate/Path/to/ssl_certification.crt; SSL_certification_KEY /PATH/SSL_CERTIFICATE.KEY; # SSL Configuratei ON SSL_SESSION_CACHE ShaRED: SSL: 10M; SSL_SESSION_TIMEOUT 5M; # Add SSL Specific Settings Here ... # Reverse proxy to backend HTTP server location / { proxy_pass http://backend; proxy_redirect off; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on; } } ``` 4. Save and close the file, then restart Nginx: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` Your Nginx server is now configured to handle HTTPS requests.
