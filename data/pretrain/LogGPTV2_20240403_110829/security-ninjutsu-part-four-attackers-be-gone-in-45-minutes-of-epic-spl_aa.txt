Ninjutsu 2017!
SPL AWESOMESAUCE
▶ If you forced my co-workers to pick a single top 	skill of David Veuve, single top reason to bring 	him into a meeting, it is: SPL Skills
▶ Let David be David - here is all the SPL fit to 	print▶ You are looking at the PDF copy of these slides. There is a lot of context and explanation in these slides.
▶ I recommend checking out the video as well, to help reinforce the key takeaways, and use this PDF as the reference to implement those ideas
Oh Snap, there’s an App?
What’s the happs.. there’s an app?
Splunk Security Essentials
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/
▶ Not explicitly focused on this session, but lots of good working detection logic
▶ Also demonstrates what you *can* 
do with Splunk and Security 
Detection
So What Are We Going to Talk About? Did someone say "Obligatory Word Cloud"?
Most Important Announcement
▶ Very little of what was covered in this deck was actually built or discovered by 	me.▶ We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and I like to think the giants I stand on 	the shoulders of are as tall as they come.
▶ Major shout outs go to far too many people to mention here, including many of 	my customers who have come up with innovative ideas.
▶ Also, you know, the engineers deserve some credit for building the product in the first place, and anticipating so many needs that we would have while also allowing it to support so many needs they couldn’t anticipate.▶ /me hat tips
	Let’s Get Into It
▶ Over the rest of the presentation, we will go through different SPL techniques that 
have opened eyes and helped Splunkers in the past.
▶ For each technique we will state:
• Problem statement: Why do you care?
• Describe the technique: How do you solve?
• Lots of real SPL to do this: Pics or it didn’t happen

Intermediate TechniquesIntermediate Techniques
Where was introductory? This presentation starts at 5 and goes to 15.
Technique: Common Information Model
Background and Challenges
▶ "I have 7 different sourcetypes with different field names for authentication and I 	want to write just one search that crosses all of those"
▶ "I want to write a presentation on security SPL in a way that can apply to any 	security customer and represent concepts in generic terms"▶ The common information model allows us to do exactly that - use a single 
nomenclature across many searches, many sourcetypes, in many environments
	Technique: Common Information Model▶ Building a dashboard? Print something good, and then drilldown well.
tag=authentication 
| chart count over src by action 
| where success>0 AND failure>10| where success>0 AND failure>10 
	We can just say tag=authentication instead of specifying our Windows Logs, Linux Logs, PAN Auth 	Logs, Oracle Auth Logs… (I could go on all day)
	action is a field defined in the Common Information Model - look at how we can just reference it so easily 	and it will track successes or failures across all 	sourcetypes
Ah, building correlation searches on Splunk is easy!Technique: Common Information Model

Background and Challenges
▶ I assume you already know the basics of eval, but there are several functions I 	use often that have wow’d some people.
▶ "How do I deal with different data types containing multiple field names?"▶ "I hate nested if statements!"
▶ "I want to do super advanced string manipulations"
▶ Even if you don’t see an immediate use case for these techniques, remember 	them. I promise it will be worth it.Technique: Eval
The coalesce Function
▶ coalesce is an often overlooked function, that will return the first non-null value. 
▶ Whenever you have multiple data types, you will invariably have different field names for the same value. Combining them into one field without overwriting different values is done by most Splunk users with if statements or other extreme hijinks. coalesce is much easier.(sourcetype=datasource1 Source_IP=*) OR (sourcetype=datasource2 srcip=*)
| eval src_ip = coalesce(srcip, Source_IP)
Begin with your disparate data sources
For datasource1, srcip will be null. For datasource2, 
Source_IP will be null. src_ip will always have the 
right result.
Technique: Eval
The case FunctionTechnique: Eval
The case Function
▶ case is skipped by almost everyone who has never been a programmer. If you’ve been a 	programmer, you already know about it. If you haven’t, get psyched.
▶ One of the greatest strengths of eval is that it allows you to embed all manner of business logic. Invariably, this requires you to have if statements… but often, you end up with multiple scenarios. If a, then x, if b, then y, if c, then z, if d, then throw an error.▶ Many use nested if statements, but case handles multiple conditions with ease. 
sourcetype=datasource1 
| eval direction = case(
cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", src_ip) AND NOT 
	cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", dest_ip), "outgoing", NOT cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", src_ip) AND 
	cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", dest_ip), "incoming", cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", src_ip) AND 
	cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", dest_ip), "internal", 1=1, "outgoing to outgoing.. Add the public IP ranges")Begin with your dataset
Conditional One: Outgoing Traffic
Conditional Two: Incoming Traffic
Conditional Three: Internal Traffic
Default (1=1): Whatever Else
Technique: Eval
The searchmatch Function
▶ When it comes to applying business logic via eval, there are tons of options, mostly covered here: http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/6.6.0/SearchReference/ConditionalFunctions▶ A favorite of mine is searchmatch. I have seen it be slower than a highly optimized field-based 	approach, but it makes logic so easy that anyone can get started with it.
▶ What searchmatch will do is simply run a search, just as if you used the | search command, but 	within an eval if or case statement. Here are some examples:
sourcetype=what_have_yousourcetype=what_have_you
| eval is_us = if(searchmatch("country: US"), 1, 0) | eval do_errors_exist = if(searchmatch("error"), 1, 0)
| stats 
This *should* be extracted into a field, but if you 	haven’t done it yet, you can use searchmatch.
Maybe we just need to know if a particular string is in 	the raw logs
count 	We are just checking a field here, which you could 
sum(is_us)sum(is_us) 
count(eval(searchmatch("type=important") 
by do_errors_exist
do directly, but if you’re not comfortable with more advanced methods yet, stay simple. 
And of course we can embed this into stats - see eval + stats in this presentation for more here. 
Technique: Eval
The replace FunctionTechnique: Eval
The replace Function
▶ Often we run into scenarios where you need to do string manipulation. In Splunk we often end up using | rex for these scenarios, as it can do regex field extraction and also sed search and replace. However, those are universal. With eval and replace, you can put this inside of a conditional.
sourcetype=what_have_yousourcetype=what_have_you
| eval _raw=if(NOT searchmatch("country: US"), 	replace(_raw, "user=\S*", "user=XXXXX"), 
_raw)
| eval user=if(NOT searchmatch("country: US"), 	"XXXXX", 
_raw)
If this is not a US message, let’s replace the username with a series of Xs in the raw log
Let’s do the same thing with the username field.
We don’t actually recommend enforcing field based
