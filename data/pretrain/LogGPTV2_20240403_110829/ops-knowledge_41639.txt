User: I need to copy huge files from remotemachine1 to remotemachine2-remotemachine10.
What is the best way to do it ? Doing a get on remotemachine1 and then a put to all the remaining machines aren't ideal as the file is huge and I need to be able to send the Fabric command from my laptop. The remotemachines are all in the same network. Or should I do a run('rsync /file_on_remotemachine1 RemoteMachine2:/targetpath/') ? 
Is there a better way to do this in Fabric ?
Assistant: Best way would be running the script from remotemachine1 if you can.
