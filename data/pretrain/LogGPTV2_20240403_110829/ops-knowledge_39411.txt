User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Domino always server fails to send SMTP email at first attempt In our logs, we find the below:

Router: No messages transferred to example.com (host mx.example.com) via SMTP: The server is not responding. The server may be down or you may be experiencing network problems. Contact your system administrator if this problem persists.


Which is then followed by:

Router: Transferring mail to domain example.com (host mx.example.com [111.111.111.111]) via SMTP

Router: Message 12345678 transferred to mx.example.COM for recipient@example.com via SMTP

Router: Transferred 1 messages to example.com (host mx.example.com) via SMTP


Our messages go out normally, but we see this same issue EVERY connection we make. I beleive there is something wrong with my configuration, probably with a timeout, or something similar, but I have not been able to pinpoint it correctly.

Assistant: This looks like a problem I had in a different context: To find out the reason you could try the following: 

Open a cmd on the server
type the following commands

nslookup
set type=mx
example.com


And look at the results: I bet, that there will be timeouts / other strange behaviour. 
Domino uses this method to determin the mx- record for the target domain. And if this lookup needs to long, it will show the posted error, and try again... then it gets the cached values, and everything is fine. 

If the mx- lookup is fast enough, then resolving the name into an IP address might be the problem. 

Try the following commands to validate that:

nslookup
mx.example.com


That should give you the IP- address of the mx- record. How fast is this lookup?
This DNS lookup could also be made with a simple ping mx.example.com. In one case I had every first and second ping failing but succeeding pings where successfull... then the same error would be on the console.  

I guess this is a network issue and has nothing to do with your domino- configuration.
Fix the network, and domino will be fixed.
