Playwright already offers the important assertion method `toHaveClass` but
unfortunately it is not possible to use it, when explicitly checking for one
class attribute.  
The function offers several options for the `expected` argument, but is seems
not possible to ensure that the class attribute contains one specific class
attribute.  
Using a regular expression is possible but relies on the exact order of class
attributes and the delimiters used.  
Maybe an property could be added the the options argument that allows to
specify if the class string should be compared or rather a
`classList.contains` operation (like in the native DOM) is wanted.  
Checking for the existence of one specific class attribute in my experience is
a very common tasks and should be made as simple as possible.
