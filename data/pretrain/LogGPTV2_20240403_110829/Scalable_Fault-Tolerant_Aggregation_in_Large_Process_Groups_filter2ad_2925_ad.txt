gossiping at low rates), or of explicit message and member 
failures, on the completeness of  the protocol.  In  the  next 
section, we present performance results of running our pro- 
tocol  over a simulated  lossy  network with  fail-prone ma- 
chines (members).  These experiments seek to better quan- 
440 
tify  the effect of varying group size, message delivery and 
me,mber failure rates, and .gossip rates, on the completeness 
of  the protocol. 
7. Simulation Results 
In  this  section,  we  present  performance results  of  the 
Hierarchical  Gossiping  Approach  to  calculate  aggregate 
global composable functions in large groups. 
The analysis of  Section 6.3 showed that the protocol’s 
completeness is satisfactory  for fairly  high  rates of  gossip 
(6 2 4). In this section, we investigate the effect of low gos- 
sip rates on the completeness of our protocol. These simula- 
tions demonstrate the effect of varying group size, message 
delivery  and member faillure rates, and gossip rates on the 
completeness probability guaranteed. They also account for 
the effect of asynchrony among the different members as to 
which  phase they  are in., This contrasts with  the  simplis- 
tic assumption made in the earlier analysis that all members 
proceed together from phase to phase in the protocol. 
Figures 6-1 1 show the effect of the different protocol pa- 
rameters and  network characteristics on  the  completeness 
achieved by the Hierarchical gossiping protocol. Each point 
in  these  plots  is  the  average  of  several  runs  of  the  pro- 
tocol  in  a  group  with  N  (initial) members,  communicat- 
ing  over  a  lossy  asynchronous  network with  independent 
unicast  (point-to-point)  message .loss probability  ucastl. 
Members were prone to crashes (without recovery) in  ev- 
ery gossip round with  probability p f .  A gossip round at a 
member consisted of attempts to gossip with  M  randomly 
selected members. The number of gossip rounds per proto- 
col  phase was  LC  . logdlv]. The hash  function H used 
Wiis  a  fair  one,  and  not /topologically aware.  The proto- 
col  was  started simultankously at all  group members,  but 
thlxeafter, members proceeded asynchronously from phase 
to phase in  the protocol ias described in  step 2(b) in  Sec- 
tion  6.3).  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  default  parame- 
ters  used  in  the Figures.6-11 were  N  = 200,ucastl  = 
0.25,pf  = 0.001,K  = 4,M  = 2,C  = 1.0.  Themet- 
ric: measured on the y-axis was the protocol’s average mea- 
sured Incompleteness = l - completeness. Figures 6-10 
pl.ot the incompleteness on a logarithmic scale. 
Figure 6 plots the variation  of  Incompleteness versus 
the group size N .  As N  is  increased, the number of pro- 
tocol  phases and the duration ‘of each phase also rise.  This 
curve shows that  the  average completeness  guarantees of 
the  algorithm improve slightly as N  is  increased  into the 
1000’s.  Notice  that the  result  of  theorem  1 does not  ap- 
ply here (since the parameter b evaluates to about 0.75), yet 
the completeness guaranteed improves with the number of 
group members varying into the 1000’s. 
Figure 7  shows that the  incompleteness falls exponen- 
tially, with increasing network message reliability. Figure 8

shows the effect of the duration of a phase in the protocol 
(in number of  gossip rounds) on the average completeness 
guaranteed.  Since M  = 2  is  fixed,  increasing the  phase 
duration amounts to increasing the gossip rate. The incom- 
pleteness falls exponentially  with  increasing duration  of  a 
protocol phase, and thus with the rate of gossip. 
Figure  9  shows the  result  of  an  experiment  where  the 
group with  N  members  was  partitioned  into  two  halves, 
with messages across the partition being subjected to drop- 
ping  independently  with  probability  partl.  Messages 
within  each  partition  were  dropped  independently  with 
probability ucastl. This experiment was conducted to mea- 
sure the performance of the Hierarchical gossiping protocol 
in the presence of a network partition, the most major symp- 
tom of congestion and correlated message delivery failures 
in  wide area networks.  Figure 9 shows that the protocol's 
completeness degrades gracefully as the partitionkorrelated 
failure rate becomes worse. 
Figure  10 demonstrates  that the  protocol's  incomplete- 
ness falls very quickly (faster than exponential) with falling 
member failure rate.  Finally,  Figure  1 1  compares the  av- 
erage incompleteness  guaranteed  by  a run  of  the  protocol 
with  the  limit  imposed  in  Theorem  I .   Values  of  C  = 
1.4,ucastl  = pf  = 0.0 were used,  so that  b evaluated to 
about  1.0.  Although  this  does  not  satisfy  the  conditions 
for Theorem  1,  Figure  1 1  shows that  the  incompleteness 
is bounded by k. This reflects the pessimism  of the bound 
imposed by Theorem  1, and with Figure 8, suggests that a 
more rigorous analysis of our protocol  will  show an expo- 
nential variation of incompleteness with the gossip rate. 
8. Conclusion 
In  this  paper,  we  have  discussed  several  solutions  to 
the  problem of  scalably  and  accurately calculating  global 
(composable) aggregate  functions  in  large groups,  target- 
ing large-scale sensor networks, ad-hoc networks and pro- 
cess groups over the Internet.  We have  argued why  tradi- 
tional  approaches  to solving this  problem do not  scale  in 
large groups, and do not perform well over fault-prone net- 
works. We have then proposed a technique to construct ab- 
stract hierarchies over such large process groups, and pro- 
posed a solution  that  uses  gossiping  within  this  hierarchy 
to evaluate composable global  aggregate  functions  in  the 
group.  Our mathematical  analysis and  simulation  results 
show that the proposed Hierarchical Gossiping protocol  is 
poly-logarithmically sub-optimal in time and message com- 
plexity and guarantees good completeness probability, i.e., 
probability  of  a  member  vote  being  included  in  the  final 
global  estimate.  These completeness guarantees are fairly 
robust  to random message  losses, crashes of  group mem- 
bers, and even  correlated message failures in the network, 
Besides, the completeness guarantees improve with increas- 
442 
ing group size, even at IOW  fates of gossiping.
