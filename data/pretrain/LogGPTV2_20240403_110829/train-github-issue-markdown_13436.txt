Subject: Assistance Required: Unable to Retrieve Minions via kubectl

Hello,

I have followed the steps to retrieve minions using `kubectl`, but encountered an error. Here are the details:

```
core@kube-00 ~ $ kubectl get minions
Error: Get "http://localhost:8080/api/v1beta3/minions": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connection refused
```

The deployment was successful, and I can confirm that all nodes are up and running in Azure.

Could you please assist me in resolving this issue?

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
