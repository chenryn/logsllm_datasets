User: I'm using Linux Mint Debian Edition (eq. Debian Testing). There is no python2.6-dev package, which I'd need to install pycrypto for Python 2.6 (since it has a compilation step).
Is there any way to get this package or an equivalent on my system? I already have installed Python 2.6 in my system and I can use it without a hitch.
(The python2.7-dev package is there just fine. But I'm glued to 2.6, so it doesn't suit my needs.)
Assistant: I know this might seem extreme but if you need 2.6 that badly, try running debian stable in a virtual machine like virtualbox and install 2.6 through that.
