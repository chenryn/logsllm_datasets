The extensible markup language (XML) (XML, 2007)
was originally pictured as a language for defining
new document formats for the WWW. An important
feature of this language is the separation of content
from presentation, which makes it easier to select and/
or reformat data. XML is a text-based format that pro-
vides mechanisms for describing document structures
using markup tags (words surrounded by ‘’).
Both HTML and XML representations use tags such

• Predicates are aspects about a resource, and

• Object is the value that is assigned to the
