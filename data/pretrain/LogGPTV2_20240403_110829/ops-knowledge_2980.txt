User:  How to deploy a highly available Nginx web server to ensure the stability and availability of the server?
Assistant: To deploy a highly available Nginx web server, you can take the following steps: 1. Use a load balancer: Using a load balancer can distribute traffic to multiple servers, thereby improving system stability and availability. Commonly used load balancers include Nginx, HAProxy, F5, etc. 2. Using multiple nodes: Using multiple nodes can avoid a single point of failure, that is, when a node fails, other nodes can continue to provide services to users. Multiple nodes can be implemented using multiple virtual machines. 3. Set up health checks: Health checks can periodically check the server status. If a node has a problem, it will be cut out from the load balancer immediately, so that users will not access the problematic node. 4. Use dynamic DNS: If you use a fixed IP address to map to a domain name, you need to manually change the DNS record when the node fails, which will cause service interruption for a period of time. The use of dynamic DNS can automatically exclude faulty nodes to ensure the continuity and stability of services. 5. Deploy Nginx high-availability cluster: Nginx can be configured into multiple nodes to achieve high availability. available.
