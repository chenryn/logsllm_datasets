# Environment
    Windows build number: [Version 10.0.18363.720]
    PowerToys version: v0:19.0
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
  * Create and apply layout
  * Hide taskbar
  * Drag a window to a zone bordering the taskbar
  * Launch Zones Editor (to reapply layout)
  * Drag a window to a zone bordering the taskbar
  * Unhide taskbar
  * (repeat 3-5)
# Expected behavior
This was the behavior prior to v0.19.0
  * Stretch layout to fill available screen (in-/excluding where taskbar would be or not, respectively) _immediately after toggling taskbar_
  * Zones Preview accurately represent layout
# Actual behavior
  * Keeps previous stretching when toggling taskbar.  
Will only re-stretch when re-applying layout after switching to a different
one.
  * Area where taskbar would be is blank in zones preview, no matter if the layout includes the area (see above) or not.
# Screenshots
Window not stretched into freed area after hiding taskbar (layout not
reapplied)

Area under taskbar blank in preview - layout **was** reapplied, so window
would stretch correctly, but preview is not showing this
