ABSTRACT
We investigate the dimensionality properties of the Internet
delay space, i.e., the matrix of measured round-trip laten-
cies between Internet hosts. Previous work on network co-
ordinates has indicated that this matrix can be embedded,
with reasonably low distortion, into a 4- to 9-dimensional
Euclidean space. The application of Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) reveals the same dimensionality values. Our
work addresses the question: to what extent is the dimen-
sionality an intrinsic property of the delay space, deﬁned
without reference to a host metric such as Euclidean space?
Is the intrinsic dimensionality of the Internet delay space
approximately equal to the dimension determined using em-
bedding techniques or PCA? If not, what explains the dis-
crepancy? What properties of the network contribute to
its overall dimensionality? Using datasets obtained via the
King [14] method, we study diﬀerent measures of dimension-
ality to establish the following conclusions. First, based on
its power-law behavior, the structure of the delay space can
be better characterized by fractal measures. Second, the
intrinsic dimension is signiﬁcantly smaller than the value
predicted by the previous studies; in fact by our measures
it is less than 2. Third, we demonstrate a particular way in
which the AS topology is reﬂected in the delay space; sub-
networks composed of hosts which share an upstream Tier-1
autonomous system in common possess lower dimensional-
ity than the combined delay space. Finally, we observe that
fractal measures, due to their sensitivity to non-linear struc-
tures, display higher precision for measuring the inﬂuence of
subtle features of the delay space geometry.

INTRODUCTION
Network latency plays a central role in the design of a large
class of Internet services as their performance is sensitive
to the choice of the communicating participants.
In light
of this, coordinate-based network positioning systems have
received considerable attention in the past few years [10,
12, 28, 32, 35, 39]. These approaches aim at providing a
compact representation of the Internet delay space (i.e., the
matrix of measured round-trip latencies between Internet
hosts) by modeling the network as contained in a vector
space. In this process, known as network embedding, each
node is assigned a coordinate in a host metric space (e.g.,
Euclidean space) in such a way that the geometric distance
between any two nodes estimates the real latency between
them within a tolerable degree of error.
However, coordinate-based systems inherently suﬀer from
embedding distortion, instability, slow convergence, and dis-
appointing accuracy, as pointed out by [22] and [24]. More-
over, as discussed in [25] and [37], some aspects of the Inter-
net graph make it diﬃcult to model as a well-deﬁned geomet-
ric object. As a result, these obstacles motivate positioning
systems without coordinates [25, 26, 33, 44] as a more func-
tionally viable alternative due to their improved accuracy,
despite the fact that they are often measurement intensive
and, in some cases, some types of queries are not available
to network participants (e.g., the prediction of distances be-
tween any two other arbitrary nodes.).
As a way of understanding the potentialities and limita-
tions of coordinate-based systems, we investigate a critical
aspect inﬂuencing the eﬀectiveness of this approach, namely
the dimensionality of the Internet delay space. The main
component of such systems consists of an embedding algo-
rithm for which the number of dimensions of the host metric
space (denoted hereafter by d) is a tunable parameter.
Embeddings with diﬀerent numbers of dimensions result
in diﬀerent degrees of accuracy, since distance matrices posses
a minimum intrinsic dimensionality [12, 28, 39]. In addition,
since embedding techniques are based on some variation of
an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the prediction
error, the algorithms suﬀer from the curse of dimensional-

ity. That is to say that the algorithm’s complexity increases
with the number of dimensions to the point that it becomes
unable to deal with the overwhelming number of degrees of
freedom to explore. Often times, this phenomenon occurs
due to the unnecessary inﬂation of the metric space [6]. Fi-
nally, the convergence time, which increases with d, aﬀects
the stability of coordinates and the adaptability to changes,
thereby aﬀecting the reliability of the predictions [12, 22].
Previous studies indicated that embeddings of the Internet
delay space can be created using 4 to 9 dimensions with rea-
sonably low distortion in a Euclidean space [28, 39]. Dabek
et al. [12] demonstrated that augmenting the embedding
with height vectors, which are thought of as distance penal-
ties incurred by traversing the last-mile access links in the
Internet topology, allows one to use a lower-dimensional Eu-
clidean space while retaining a similar level of accuracy. The
application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [38] re-
veals the same dimensionality values [39].
However, this work prompts many questions which are
still elusive: Can the dimensionality of the network be deter-
mined by embedding it into a host metric such as Euclidean
space, or is there a more robust way of deﬁning dimension-
ality, independent of the choice of host metric? Is the ob-
served number of dimensions that produces low distortion
embeddings in [12, 28, 39] optimal? More importantly, what
properties of the Internet contribute to its dimensionality?
The characterization of the Internet delay space dimen-
sionality, apart from its implications to the performance of
coordinate systems, is by itself a topic of practical interest
as it uncovers properties and opens new questions on the
nature and complexity of the network [31].
As illustrated by [40], certain features of the Internet can
be deduced purely from its delay-space geometry. For exam-
ple, the partition of Internet hosts according to continents
can be approximately reconstructed by clustering unlabeled
distance data. As another example, it is unknown how much
empty space is left by embedding the Internet using the cur-
rent algorithms.
If the empty space is signiﬁcantly large,
then extra overhead and complexity are being unnecessar-
ily incurred by positioning systems.
In addition, previous
studies — as well as ours — have focused on datasets with
up to a few thousand data points. However, theoretical re-
sults assert that in the worst case, the number of dimensions
and distortion of an embedding increase logarithmically with
the cardinality of the point set [8]. Therefore, a practical
characterization issue, also critical for synthetic delay space
generation purposes [45], is whether or not the dimension-
ality behavior and embedding distortion observed in previ-
ous studies will remain invariant with scaling to millions of
nodes. Finally, the performance of positioning systems with-
out coordinates also beneﬁts from the characterization of the
delay space geometry. For instance, the scaling guarantees
of Meridian [44] are based on the assumption of a doubling
metric whose main parameter is its dimensionality.
Tang and Crovella [40], and Huﬀaker et al. [16] demon-
strated that geographic location (henceforth, geolocation) is
a strong component to the Internet delay space. However,
due to routing ineﬃciencies, caused by sub-optimal behavior
of protocols, wide-area routing policies, and triangle inequal-
ity violations [39, 42, 45], great circle distances are not able
to fully explain the Internet delay space dimensionality be-
havior. If this is the case, what other forces play a role in
the dimensionality behavior?
This paper presents measurements and analysis to shed
insight on these questions. We study the Internet dimension-
ality, deﬁned as an intrinsic property of the distance matrix.
This constitutes a geometrical invariant which does not refer
to an external host metric space, such as Euclidean space,
and does not include any structural distortions and unnec-
essary dimensionality inﬂation incurred by the embedding
algorithms. We also study tools for exploring how and to
what extent network properties drive the delay space dimen-
sionality behavior. Using datasets obtained via the King [14]
method, we compare four intrinsically-deﬁned measures of
dimensionality with the dimension obtained using network
embedding techniques (such as Vivaldi [12]). We present
three main conclusions. First, based on its power-law be-
havior, the structure of the delay space is best described by
fractal measures of dimension, which measure a dimensional-
ity intrinsic to the dataset, rather than by integer-valued pa-
rameters, such as the embedding dimension or PCA. Second,
the intrinsic dimension is much smaller than the dimension
predicted by the latter methods: in fact, by some measures,
the intrinsic dimension is less than 2. Third, we quantify to
what extent geolocation drives the dimensionality behavior
and we present observations that suggest how the AS topol-
ogy is reﬂected in the delay space. More speciﬁcally, we show
that subsets of the data which can reach each other without
going through a transit link between two Tier-1 providers
consistently exhibit lower fractal dimension than the com-
bined delay space, and that no such dimensionality reduc-
tion is achieved when partitioning according to geolocation.
Given the properties observed above, we ﬁnally show evi-
dence that fractal measures of dimensionality, due to their
sensitivity to non-linear structures, display higher precision
for measuring the inﬂuence of subtle features of the delay
space geometry which are not captured by other dimension-
ality measures.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the related work, Section 3 describes our experi-
mental methodology, and Section 4 describes the notions of
dimensionality we use in this work. Finally, Section 5 ap-
plies the proposed measures to study delay space features,
and Section 6 oﬀers our conclusions.
2. RELATED WORK
The ﬁrst work to propose network embedding for the In-
ternet was GNP (Global Network Positioning) [28]. In this
work, Ng and Zhang tackle the complexity of the embedding
by incrementally determining the coordinates of participants
with respect to a set of a few previously chosen nodes (bea-
cons or landmarks). These infrastructure nodes measure
their inter-distance and determine their coordinates in some
d-dimensional metric space. As a result they function as ref-
erences in space so that subsequent incoming nodes can de-
termine their own coordinates. This is done via a non-linear
optimization problem that aims at minimizing the overall
discrepancy between the geometric and measured distances.
Hence, arriving participants compute the same minimiza-
tion problem to determine their own absolute coordinates,
by actively measuring their distance to the already-oriented
beacons. Later on, a theoretical justiﬁcation for the suc-
cess of this approach was given by Kleinberg, Slivkins, and
Wexler [19]; we discuss their work in greater detail below.
Other examples of systems with similar scope are [10], [32],
and [35].
On comparing the distributions of relative errors incurred
by GNP using diﬀerent number of dimensions, Ng and Zhang
indicate that for the dataset studied, the best results were
achieved using 7 to 9 dimensions.
Tang and Crovella [39] address the complexity and cost of
network embedding by proposing the Lipschitz embedding.
This method relies on the assumption that, by the triangle
inequality, two nearby points, say a and b, have similar dis-
tance to a third point x, that is |d(a, x) − d(b, x)| ≤ |d(a, b)|
and is deﬁned in terms of a set D of subsets of a point
set X. The distance function d deﬁnes the distance from a
point x to one of the sets Li ∈ D as the distance from x
the nearest point of Li. Thus, the embedding is the map-
ping φ(x) = [d(x, L1), d(x, L2), ..., d(x, L|D|)], where |D| cor-
responds to the dimensionality of the embedding. When ev-
ery Li is a singleton, each element represents a beacon and,
therefore, component j of vector ~xi is actually the measured
distance from x to landmark j.
Since the number of dimensions required by the above
embedding is high, the authors apply PCA, discussed in
Section 4.3.2, to determine an r-dimensional space (where
r (cid:28) n) in which the data can be approximated with low
loss of accuracy. As a result, each ~xi is transformed into a
~yi, where each component of the latter is a linear combina-
tion of the distances to landmarks. Thus, they can be seen
as distances to virtual landmarks. The method is evaluated
using several real Internet datasets, and the number of di-
mensions that capture most of the overall variation of the
data is between 7 and 9, incurring mean relative errors of 8
