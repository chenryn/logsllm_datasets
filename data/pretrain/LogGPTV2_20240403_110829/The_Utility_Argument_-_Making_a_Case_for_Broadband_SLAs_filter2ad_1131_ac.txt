case of broken SLA. In this section we study if SLAs could be tailored for each
end-user individually.
The key question we try to answer is whether the provider could infer the
likelihood of delivering the SLA. For instance, it is possible that certain user
characteristics are correlated with the quality of service the user receives and
hence the SLA provider may choose to price the service (premium in insurance
terms) according to the risk of not delivering promised SLA to this set of users.
With a good understanding of how likely it is to break the SLA the insurer (either
a third party or the broadband provider itself) can ﬁne tune the SLA parameters
and the premium3 (in $ per month) in order to improve user satisfaction with
the service and ensure the proﬁtability of the SLA service.
We train a simple model to examine the predictability of the service of indi-
vidual subscribers complying to an SLA based on several simple user features
available to us: (1) access technology, (2) base latency (to the nearest measure-
ment server), (3) aggregate usage (in bytes per month) and (4) city popula-
tion (a proxy of urban/rural residence). More advanced models, using a range
of additional demographic and technological features, would likely improve the
prediction accuracy, yet such analysis is out of scope of this short study and is
left for future work.
We use supervised learning for estimating the likelihood of breaking the SLA,
for the three SLA types described in Table 1 with 95% time threshold (i.e., the
users’ performance complies with the SLA 95% of the time). This is basically
a binary classiﬁcation task, where we use four user features described above to
predict whether the user complies with SLA or not. The features are extracted
on 4038 active users in October and November 2014. The categorical feature
describing access technology is projected to a binary vector (of length 4) encoding
the access technology of every user.
We experimented with several classiﬁcation methods including L2-regularized
logistic regression, gradient boosting trees and random forests. We report the
results from random forests which showed slightly better performance although
the performance of all methods were comparable. The hyper-parameters were
optimized using a grid-search over a validation set extracted from the training
set. We use fourfold cross validation to predict the chance of breaking SLA.
The features are extracted in October 2014 and the (binary) SLA compliance is
extracted for November 2014.
We use Area Under Curve Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUCROC), a
standard metric for measuring the performance of the binary classiﬁers [13]. The
ROC curve as well as the AUCROC are reported in Fig. 7 for the three SLAs
from Table 1.
The AUCROC for all three SLAs: A, B and C, is similar and is around 0.8. Such
AUCROC is comparable to the precision of classiﬁers build from demographic
user information in other insurance products such as cars and credit ratings [17].
3 The key cost for the ISP selling an SLA is the loss of revenue when the SLA is
broken. Hence the stricter SLA the higher expected cost for the ISP which may be
passed down to the end-user in the form of higher premium/monthly subscription.

This accuracy of prediction for SLA compliance suggests that it would be possible
to oﬀer personalized SLAs with a price which accurately matches the likelihood
of breaking the SLA.
City population and population density are loosely correlated with last-mile
performance, especially in the context of DSL [1]. However, city population
appears to have minor predictive power for inferring the likelihood of SLA vio-
lations in our dataset.
5 Discussion
Recent eﬀorts [4,19,20,24] have attempted to address the lack of detailed evalu-
ations of ISPs. Annual reports published by the FCC in the US and Ofcom in the
UK have studied whether or not ISPs are providing the capacities promised to
users. The recent Net Neutrality ruling from the FCC [11,12] discussed the issue
of how service plans are described to subscribers. One part of the ruling states
that ISPs must disclose reasonable estimates of performance metrics, including
both latency and packet loss. Unfortunately, what exactly is a “reasonable” esti-
mate of these metrics is somewhat unclear. Additionally, providing the estimates
alone does not oﬀer any protection for consumers that may experience seriously
degraded performance.
This work points to a number of interesting research directions that are cru-
cial for implementing broadband SLAs. For example, perhaps the largest road-
block to adoption of broadband SLAs is the lack of infrastructure for monitor-
ing performance and reporting SLA violations. One potential avenue to explore
would be the deployment of a system, such as SLAM [23], on home gateways or
modems that could monitor SLA compliance. These devices could be distributed
by the SLA provider (either the ISP or a third party). The design of a reliable
processes for the automatic generation and ﬁling of SLA violation reports and
reporting, to both the subscriber and the ISP, is another interesting research
direction.
There is also a need to consider factors beyond throughput, latency, and
packet loss. For example, high packet delay variations could impact user quality

of experience. Furthermore, recent peering disputes between content providers
and broadband access providers [14,22] highlight the importance of measuring
congestion on a provider’s peering links and its potential impact on performance.
Poor quality of experience while streaming via Netﬂix or making Skype calls
would not be captured by the measurements used in this paper if this is caused
by congestion at the edge of the provider’s network.
Another aspect we have not explored is the design of SLAs that both ﬁt
what a user’s needs and what they can aﬀord, an area we have explored in past
work [2]. For example, an SLA that promises to provide lower latency, from 25 ms
to 15 ms, could come at a hefty price for the ISP and yet provide little value
to subscribers. Additionally, the availability of other services that are typically
hosted by the ISP, such as DNS or email, may be more important to some users
than a guaranteed throughput rate.
Previous work has suggest that consumers could beneﬁt from improvements
in how service oﬀerings are described to customers [26] and shown that the
relationship between QoS metrics (as those we used in our deﬁnitions of SLA)
and users’ experience with diﬀerent applications is an open research problem.
Nevertheless, all existing approaches we are aware of rely on such QoS metrics
as input to application speciﬁc models of QoE estimation (e.g., [5,15]).
6 Conclusion
This work is partially motivated by the FCC’s recent classiﬁcation of broadband
as a utility. We believe that this is a natural course for broadband Internet, as
it progresses from a luxury to a key utility and, in some countries, considered a
basic human right. The growing understanding of broadband connectivity as a
utility will, in turn, usher in a demand for more encompassing, well-deﬁned SLAs.
The introduction of SLAs could enable broadband operators to personalize the
service oﬀerings down to the individual customer and improve their eﬃciency
and overall user satisfaction. Broadband SLAs could also facilitate transparent
competition, ultimately beneﬁting both consumers and service providers. In this
paper, we explored the possibility of implementing broadband SLAs and demon-
strated that certain SLAs could be oﬀered almost immediately with small impact
on the retail prices and network investment. We showed that ISPs (or third par-
ties) could accurately infer the risk of oﬀering SLA to individual customers, with
accuracy comparable to that in other insurance markets, and price SLA services
accordingly.
