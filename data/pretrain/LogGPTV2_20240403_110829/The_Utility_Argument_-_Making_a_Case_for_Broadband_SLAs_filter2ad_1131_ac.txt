**Case of Broken SLA: Tailoring SLAs for Individual End-Users**

In this section, we explore the feasibility of tailoring Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for each end-user individually. The primary question we aim to address is whether a service provider can accurately infer the likelihood of meeting the SLA for each user. For instance, certain user characteristics may be correlated with the quality of service received, allowing the SLA provider to price the service (similar to premium pricing in insurance) based on the risk of not delivering the promised SLA to specific users.

With a good understanding of the likelihood of breaking an SLA, the insurer (whether a third party or the broadband provider itself) can fine-tune the SLA parameters and the premium (in dollars per month) to enhance user satisfaction and ensure the profitability of the SLA service.

### Methodology

We trained a simple model to examine the predictability of individual subscribers' compliance with an SLA based on several user features available to us:
1. Access technology
2. Base latency (to the nearest measurement server)
3. Aggregate usage (in bytes per month)
4. City population (as a proxy for urban/rural residence)

More advanced models, incorporating additional demographic and technological features, could potentially improve prediction accuracy. However, such an analysis is beyond the scope of this study and is left for future work.

We used supervised learning to estimate the likelihood of breaking the SLA for the three types described in Table 1, with a 95% time threshold (i.e., the user's performance complies with the SLA 95% of the time). This task is essentially a binary classification problem, where we predict whether a user complies with the SLA or not using the four user features mentioned above. The features were extracted from 4038 active users in October and November 2014. The categorical feature describing access technology was projected into a binary vector (of length 4) encoding the access technology of each user.

We experimented with several classification methods, including L2-regularized logistic regression, gradient boosting trees, and random forests. We report the results from random forests, which showed slightly better performance, although all methods were comparable. Hyper-parameters were optimized using grid search over a validation set extracted from the training set. Fourfold cross-validation was used to predict the chance of breaking the SLA. Features were extracted in October 2014, and the binary SLA compliance was determined for November 2014.

We used the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), a standard metric for evaluating binary classifiers [13]. The ROC curve and AUC-ROC are reported in Fig. 7 for the three SLAs from Table 1.

The AUC-ROC for all three SLAs (A, B, and C) is around 0.8, which is comparable to the precision of classifiers built from demographic user information in other insurance products such as car and credit ratings [17].

### Discussion

Recent efforts [4, 19, 20, 24] have aimed to address the lack of detailed evaluations of ISPs. Annual reports published by the FCC in the US and Ofcom in the UK have studied whether ISPs are providing the capacities promised to users. The recent Net Neutrality ruling from the FCC [11, 12] discussed how service plans are described to subscribers. One part of the ruling states that ISPs must disclose reasonable estimates of performance metrics, including latency and packet loss. However, what constitutes a "reasonable" estimate is somewhat unclear. Additionally, providing these estimates alone does not protect consumers from experiencing seriously degraded performance.

This work highlights several important research directions for implementing broadband SLAs. For example, the lack of infrastructure for monitoring performance and reporting SLA violations is a significant barrier to adoption. One potential solution could be the deployment of a system, such as SLAM [23], on home gateways or modems to monitor SLA compliance. These devices could be distributed by the SLA provider (either the ISP or a third party). The design of reliable processes for the automatic generation and filing of SLA violation reports, and their reporting to both the subscriber and the ISP, is another critical research direction.

There is also a need to consider factors beyond throughput, latency, and packet loss. For example, high packet delay variations could impact user quality of experience. Recent peering disputes between content providers and broadband access providers [14, 22] highlight the importance of measuring congestion on a provider’s peering links and its potential impact on performance. Poor quality of experience while streaming via Netflix or making Skype calls, caused by congestion at the edge of the provider’s network, would not be captured by the measurements used in this paper.

Another aspect we have not explored is the design of SLAs that fit both a user’s needs and budget, an area we have addressed in past work [2]. For example, an SLA that promises to provide lower latency, from 25 ms to 15 ms, could come at a high cost for the ISP but provide little value to subscribers. Additionally, the availability of other services typically hosted by the ISP, such as DNS or email, may be more important to some users than a guaranteed throughput rate.

Previous work has suggested that consumers could benefit from improvements in how service offerings are described to customers [26] and has shown that the relationship between QoS metrics (as those used in our SLA definitions) and users’ experience with different applications is an open research problem. Nevertheless, all existing approaches we are aware of rely on such QoS metrics as input to application-specific models of QoE estimation (e.g., [5, 15]).

### Conclusion

This work is partially motivated by the FCC’s recent classification of broadband as a utility. We believe that as broadband Internet progresses from a luxury to a key utility, and in some countries, a basic human right, the growing understanding of broadband connectivity as a utility will drive demand for more comprehensive and well-defined SLAs. The introduction of SLAs could enable broadband operators to personalize service offerings down to the individual customer, improving efficiency and overall user satisfaction. Broadband SLAs could also facilitate transparent competition, ultimately benefiting both consumers and service providers. In this paper, we explored the possibility of implementing broadband SLAs and demonstrated that certain SLAs could be offered almost immediately with minimal impact on retail prices and network investment. We showed that ISPs (or third parties) could accurately infer the risk of offering SLAs to individual customers, with accuracy comparable to that in other insurance markets, and price SLA services accordingly.
