### What problem does this feature solve?
Trying to build an SSR application w/ vue-ssr while using the somewhat newly
introduced module federation plugin in webpack 5
(https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) won't work currently. It
does when focusing only on the client build but is not when trying to
prerender. The webpack plugin is not working out of the box while building for
node. In order to make this work, one can use a package from telenko
(https://github.com/telenko/node-mf), which will hook into the process and
allow for module federation to work in node. Nevertheless, due to the
adjustments, namely relying on URL, vue-server-renderer will fail to build.
### What does the proposed API look like?
To make this work it basically only requires to add nodes URL to the sandboxed
node environment.
    function createSandbox (context) {
      var sandbox = {
        Buffer: Buffer,
        URL: URL, // add URL
        console: console,
        process: process,
        setTimeout: setTimeout,
        setInterval: setInterval,
        setImmediate: setImmediate,
        clearTimeout: clearTimeout,
        clearInterval: clearInterval,
        clearImmediate: clearImmediate,
        __VUE_SSR_CONTEXT__: context
      };
      sandbox.global = sandbox;
      return sandbox
    }
