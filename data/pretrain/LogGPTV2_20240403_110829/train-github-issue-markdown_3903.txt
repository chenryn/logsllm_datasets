On Android, open Gallery, tap into Shrine. Then, tap an item. Notice how the
initial animation up misses frames. Then, tap back. Notice more missed frames.
Then, tap on the same item. The animation up is smooth.
Seems like something is happening on the first animation for hero'ing an item
up. Not sure what, but it's causing us to miss frames.
After the first animation, things are smooth, so we can get to great
animations with the items.
