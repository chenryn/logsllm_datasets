It would be good to have a validator for JSON date timestamps (as resulting
from `(new Date()).toJSON()` or `JSON.stringify(new Date())`, e.g.
`2014-09-13T12:08:06.080Z`)
It can be useful to validate arrays or objects resulting from the
deserialization of a JSON string where some field represents a Date object.
A common use case is when you have to write a JSON rest API and you have to
handle date fields coming from the request (and it's obviously good to
validate these fields before using them on the server side).
I have written my own implementation for this and if it seems a good feature
to integrate in the symfony core a can submit a pull request and write the
related documentation.
PS: the validator can also be extended even further and support the entire
ISO8601specification (eg. `ISO8601DateValidator`)
