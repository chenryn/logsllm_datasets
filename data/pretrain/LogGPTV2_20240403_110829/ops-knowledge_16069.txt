User: I'm checking to see if a directory exists, but I noticed I'm using os.path.exists instead of os.path.isdir.  Both work just fine, but I'm curious as to what the advantages are for using isdir instead of exists.
Assistant: os.path.isdir() checks if the path exists and is a directory and returns TRUE for the case.
Similarly, os.path.isfile() checks if the path exists and is a file and returns TRUE for the case.
And, os.path.exists()  checks if the path exists and doesnâ€™t care if the path points to a file or a directory and returns TRUE in either of the cases.
