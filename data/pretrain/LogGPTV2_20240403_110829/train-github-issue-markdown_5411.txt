While running an example from recommender system package for movielens data,
the performance of multithreaded parallel version does not seem to scale well.

To run the example download the dataset from here, unzip the files to any
folder. Clone this repository and run the movielens example in julia built
with multithreading,
  * have a thread enabled julia build
  * include the julia file
  * set OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS to 1
  * set JULIA_NUM_THREADS to desired number of threads
  * call the `test_thread(dataset_path)` method in the example script
