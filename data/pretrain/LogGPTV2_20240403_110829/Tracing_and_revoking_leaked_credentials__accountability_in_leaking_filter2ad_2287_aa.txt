## Abstract

The security of data stored in cloud environments has become a growing concern. Most existing solutions focus on ensuring that outsourced data are accessible only to authorized users with the correct access credentials. This paper introduces a trace-and-then-revoke mechanism for illegal access credential distribution, which complements existing a priori security measures. Our system, TRLAC (Tracing and Revoking Leaked Access Credentials), offers the following key features:
1. The tracing procedure can identify at least one dishonest user who illegally distributed an access credential.
2. The tracing procedure operates in a black-box manner.
3. The tracing procedure does not heavily rely on cooperation from the cloud service provider.

Once dishonest users are identified, their access rights can be revoked. We formally prove the security of TRLAC and conduct both theoretical and experimental analyses. The results show that TRLAC is secure and efficient for cloud storage, with minimal additional costs for outsourcing and access.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, cloud computing has emerged as a promising paradigm, attracting significant interest from both academia and industry. Applications range from live media and distributed cooperative work to neural network learning and mobile health monitoring. In the context of data storage, users can outsource large amounts of data to cloud servers, accessing and processing it from anywhere, anytime, without the need for local hardware and software maintenance.

Security and privacy remain major barriers to the widespread adoption of cloud computing. Existing approaches primarily provide a priori security, ensuring that only authorized users with the correct access credentials can retrieve data in plaintext. However, this is insufficient as insiders with access credentials may leak them intentionally or due to hacking. Few efforts have been made to facilitate digital forensics for credential leakage, despite its importance in legal proceedings. To address this, we propose an a posteriori approach to enhance access control over outsourced data by tracing and revoking leaked credentials.

Our contributions include:
1. A generic framework for tracing and revoking leaked access credentials (TRLAC) to enhance access control over outsourced data.
2. A concrete TRLAC scheme that extends identity-based broadcast encryption and leverages optimal fingerprint codes to encode each authorized user's access credential.
3. A thorough analysis of the proposed TRLAC scheme, including formal security proofs and performance evaluations.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 presents our TRLAC framework and threat model. Section 4 details the TRLAC construction. Section 5 provides a formal security analysis. Section 6 evaluates the performance of TRLAC. Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work

Ensuring the integrity and availability of outsourced data is crucial. Sebé and Domingo-Ferrer et al. [27] identified requirements for remotely checking the integrity of data stored by third parties. Ateniese et al. [1] introduced provable data possession (PDP) and realized the first PDP scheme, addressing privacy concerns. Other works, such as [32], enable third-party auditors to perform multiple auditing tasks while maintaining data privacy.

Authentication is another method to restrict access to authorized users. Chow et al. [9] proposed SPICE, a privacy-preserving identity-management system for cloud environments, providing features like delegatable verification. Qin et al. [26] introduced an identity-based admission scheme that enables access right proofs and privacy-preserving data uploads, though it requires trusting the server.

Data privacy is often achieved through encryption. Early works used traditional public key encryption, but this can be cumbersome. Boneh and Franklin [3] introduced identity-based encryption (IBE), where users' public keys are their identities. Waters [35] proposed the first fully-secure and efficient IBE scheme. Delerablée [11] extended this to identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE), enabling a sender to encrypt data for a set of identities.

Recent works, such as [21, 22, 36], use attribute-based encryption for flexible and fine-grained access, though at the cost of efficiency. Searchable encryption schemes, like those by Yu et al. [37], Li et al. [20], and Cao et al. [7], allow users to search encrypted data without downloading and decrypting entire files.

While these works provide a priori security, few address the issue of tracing leaked decryption keys. Boneh et al. [5, 6] and Garg et al. [12] constructed traitor tracing schemes for broadcast and attribute-based encryption, respectively. Liu et al. [16, 17, 18] proposed black-box traceable attribute-based encryption schemes. Boneh and Naor [4] and Guo et al. [14] developed tracing mechanisms using fingerprint codes, suitable for cloud storage.

Other works, such as [8, 30, 25, 39], address data leakage in cloud computing, but none specifically focus on tracing and revoking leaked access credentials. Proxy re-encryption (PRE) and identity-based PRE (IB-PRE) [2, 13, 10] allow re-encryption without revealing the message, but they require a trusted proxy. Group signature schemes [23] allow membership revocation but focus on revoking anonymity rather than private keys.

In contrast, our work focuses on tracing and revoking leaked access credentials in cloud storage. We leverage optimal fingerprint codes in identity-based broadcast encryption to trace leaked keys and provide formal security proofs and performance evaluations.
