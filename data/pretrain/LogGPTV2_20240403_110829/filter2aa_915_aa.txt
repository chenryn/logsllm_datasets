Definition of Special Skills 
Special skill – a skill not possessed by members of the general 
public and usually requiring substantial education, training or 
licensing. 
Examples – pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists 
and demolition experts. 
Not necessary to have formal education or training 
Skills can be acquired through experience or self-tutelage. 
Critical question is whether the skill set elevates to a level of 
knowledge and proficiency that eclipses that possessed by the 
general public.

In re Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC Patent Litigation, 
886 F.Supp.2d 888 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 22, 2012) 
Decision 
Data packets sent over unencrypted wireless networks  
Readily accessible to general public using basic equipment 
Patent owner's proposed protocol for sniffing accessed only 
communications sent over unencrypted networks available to 
general public using packet capture adapters 
Falls under exception to Wiretap Act ―electronic 
communication is readily accessible to the general public.‖  
Evidence obtained using protocol admissible at patent 
infringement trial with proper foundation. 18 U.S.C.A. § 
2511(2)(g)(i).

F.Supp.2d 888 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 22, 2012)  
Innovatio intercepting Wi–Fi communications 
Riverbed AirPcap Nx packet capture adapter (only $698.00) 
Software (wireshark) available for download for free.  
Laptop, software, packet capture adapter- 
Any member of general public within range of an 
unencrypted Wi–Fi network can intercept. 
Many Wi–Fi networks provided by commercial 
establishments are unencrypted and open to such 
interference from anyone with the right equipment. 
 In light of the ease of ―sniffing‖ Wi–Fi networks, the court 
concludes that the communications sent on an unencrypted Wi–Fi 
network are readily accessible to the general public.

In re Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC Patent Litigation,

Decision 
The public's lack of awareness of the ease with 
which unencrypted Wi–Fi communications can 
be intercepted by a third party is, however, 
irrelevant to a determination of whether those 
communications are ―readily accessible to the 
general public.‖   18 U.S.C. 2511(2)(g)(i)

Def con topic 
Is it Relevant?? 
Defending life and liberty and protecting property, 
twenty-one state constitutions expressly tell us, are 
constitutional rights, generally inalienable, though in some 
constitutions merely inherent or natural and God-given. 
Eugene Volokh, State Constitutional Rights of Self-Defense 
and Defense of Property, Texas Review of Law and Politics, 
Spring 2007   
Self Defense - History  
Self-defense and defense of property are long-
recognized legal doctrines, traditionally protected 
by the common law. 
Eugene Volokh, State Constitutional Rights of Self-Defense 
and Defense of Property, Texas Review of Law and Politics, 
Spring 2007   
Self Defense - History  
Common Law doctrine – Trespass to Chattel 
Recover actual damages suffered due to impairment of 
or loss of use of property. 
May use reasonable force to protect possession against 
even harmless interference. 
The law favors prevention over post-trespass recovery, as 
it is permissible to use reasonable force to retain 
possession of chattel but not to recover it after possession 
has been lost. 
Self Defense - History  
Intel v. Hamidi, 71 P. 2d. (Cal. Sp. Ct. 
June 30, 2003) 
Right to exclude people from one’s personal 
property is not unlimited. 
Self-defense of personal property one must prove  
in a place right to be 
acted without fault  
used reasonable force  
reasonably believed was necessary 
to immediately prevent or terminate other 
person's trespass or interference with 
property lawfully in his possession. 
Self Defense - History  
Moore v. State, 634 N.E. 2d. 825 (Ind. 
App. 1994) and Pointer v. State,  585 N.E. 
2d. 33 (Ind. App. 1992) 
The common-law right to protect property has 
long generally excluded the right to use force 
deadly to humans.

(a) when and to the extent necessary to 
protect the property,

To Legally Intercept Communications, 
Exception to Wiretap Act Must Apply 
Party to the Communication or Consent of

Provider Exception (System Protection)

Consent 
Where there is a legitimate expectation of 
privacy, consent provides an exception to the 
warrant and probable cause requirement. 
A computer log-on banner, workplace policy, 
or user agreement may constitute user consent 
to a search.  See  United States v. Monroe, 52

Wiretap Statute:  Rights or Property Exception 
18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(a)(i) 
A provider ―may intercept or disclose 
communications on its own machines ―in the normal 
course of employment while engaged in any activity 
which is a necessary incident to . . . the protection of 
the rights or property of the provider of that service.‖  
Generally speaking, the rights or property exception 
allows tailored monitoring necessary to protect 
computer system from harm. See U.S. v McLaren, 957 
F. Supp 215, 219 (M.D. Fla. 1997).
