User: I have a Debian system currently running with python 2.5.4. I got virtualenv properly installed, everything is working fine. Is there a possibility that I can use a virtualenv with a different version of Python?
I compiled Python 2.6.2 and would like to use it with some virtualenv. Is it enough to overwrite the binary file? Or do I have to change something in respect to the libraries?
Assistant: Even easier, by using command substitution to find python2 for you:
virtualenv -p $(which python2) <path/to/new/virtualenv/>
Or when using virtualenvwrapper : 
mkvirtualenv -p $(which python2) <env_name>
