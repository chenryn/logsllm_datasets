User: What are the ACID principles in databases? Please explain what each principle means.
Assistant: ACID refers to the abbreviation of the four basic characteristics of transaction processing in the database: 1. Atomicity (Atomicity): It means that all operations in the entire transaction either succeed or fail and roll back, even in the case of a system crash. In other words, a transaction is an indivisible minimum unit of operation. 2. Consistency: It means that the integrity and consistency of the database must be maintained at the beginning and end of the transaction, that is, the database is transferred from one consistent state to another. 3. Isolation: When multiple transactions are executed concurrently, the execution of each transaction will not be interfered by other transactions, and each transaction considers itself the only operator of the entire system to avoid mutual interference between transactions Case. 4. Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes to the data in the database are permanent, even in the case of a system crash, and the database is guaranteed to be permanently saved. Through the above four characteristics, ACID can guarantee the reliability, correctness and security of the transaction, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data, so that the data can be processed and saved correctly under any circumstances.
