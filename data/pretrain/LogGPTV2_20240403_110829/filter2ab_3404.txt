**Title: Botconf 2018 - Triada: The Past, The Present, and the (Hopefully Non-Existent) Future**

Triada is a well-known Android threat that has been in the malware research community's radar for several years. What makes Triada particularly intriguing is its unusual approach: instead of attempting to evade detection, its authors embraced it. This threat was first identified in mid-2017, preinstalled on the system images of some low-end Android devices.

Upon detecting these applications, we immediately contacted our OEM partners to address the issue, providing us with unique insights into Triada’s evolution and tactics. In this presentation, we will share Google Play Protect’s findings and reveal previously undisclosed aspects of Triada, including the extent to which it backdoored OEM system images.

We will also discuss how our unprecedented coordination with OEMs led to the successful updating of system images across the Android ecosystem, effectively mitigating the threat.
