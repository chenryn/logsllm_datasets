User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer Queued ingestion and data latencies:
Where can I view queued ingestion latency metrics?

Assistant: To view queued ingestion latency metrics, see [monitoring ingestion latency](../../monitor-queued-ingestion.md#view-the-ingestion-latency). The metrics `Stage Latency` and `Discovery Latency` show latencies in the ingestion process, and reveal if there are any long latencies.
