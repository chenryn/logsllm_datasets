User: In Linux, how to get a file on a remote server through the curl command?
Assistant: To obtain the files on the remote server through the curl command, you can use the following command: ``` curl -O [URL of the remote server file] ``` Among them, the -O option means to download the remote file to the local current directory, and Named after the remote filename. If you need to save the file to a specified directory, you can use the -c option to specify it. For example, to download the files on the remote server to the local /home/user/ directory, you can use the following command: ``` curl -O -c /home/user/ [URL of the remote server file] ``` Notes What's more, if the remote server requires authentication, you can use the -u option to specify the username and password. For example: ``` curl -u username:password -O [URL of remote server file] ```
