##### Issue Type:
  * Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.9.2  
configured module search path = None
##### Ansible Configuration:
    # inventory
    127.0.0.1 
##### Environment:
CentOS 6.6
##### Summary:
this issue is similar to #11695
I have the case, that ansible want use ssh connection, if i run ansible-
playbook with argument `"--connection=local"` or `"-c local"`.  
If I set in playbook file `"connection: local"` we have this problem, too.
The only way, how it works is, if we set in inventory file
`"ansible_connection=local"` or if we give an extra argument to ansible-
playbook command: `"-e ansible_connection=local"`.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
    ---
    - name: Test ping on localhost
      hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      tasks:
      - name: Ping!
        ping:
    run: `ansible-playbook -v test.yml`
    Remove the line connection: `local from test.yml`
    run: `ansible-playbook -v test.yml --connection=local`
##### Expected Results:
Ansible being able to run locally without the need to have ssh installed.
##### Actual Results:
Ansible doesn't require ssh when ansible_connection=local is defined in the
hosts file.  
Ansible requires ssh for a playbook when run with flag --connection=local.  
Ansible requires ssh for a playbook when declared connection: local in the
playbook.
