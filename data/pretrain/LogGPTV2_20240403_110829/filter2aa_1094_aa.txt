**Summary**

Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, and Philips (collectively, the "Coalition") have previously submitted comments emphasizing that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) can permit innovative uses of unoccupied television spectrum (the TV "white spaces") while ensuring that incumbent licensees are protected from harmful interference. The Coalition has provided detailed technical rules that would enable robust unlicensed use of the white spaces while safeguarding incumbents. To further support their position, the Coalition has designed, built, and arranged to submit a prototype device for FCC testing. In contrast, opponents of white space use have primarily offered conjecture and assumptions that do not reflect real-world device operations.

The record reflects near-universal agreement on the need for the FCC to conduct objective testing to evaluate how devices will operate in the white spaces. The Coalition strongly supports rigorous testing and believes it should be the cornerstone of this proceeding. The Coalition urges the FCC to give preference to technical and operational proposals supported by devices available for testing.

In its opening comments, the Coalition urged the FCC to authorize personal/portable devices concurrently with fixed devices, allowing personal/portable devices to employ spectrum sensing technology to avoid causing harmful interference to incumbents. This approach will maximize the benefits of the white spaces by enabling a range of innovative devices and services while protecting incumbents. Therefore, the Coalition recommends the following actions:

1. **Technical and Operational Parameters**: The FCC's rules should accommodate the Coalition's proposed parameters for a personal/portable spectrum sensing device. The Coalition encourages the FCC to rigorously test its prototype to confirm that these parameters provide incumbents with the necessary protection.

2. **Authorization of Personal/Portable Devices**: The FCC should authorize personal/portable devices at the same time or before authorizing fixed devices. Opponents seeking to delay the introduction of personal/portable devices cite the need for more information, but fixed device prototypes are not even available for testing.

3. **Unlicensed Allocation of the White Spaces**: The FCC should reaffirm its initial decision to allocate the TV white spaces on an unlicensed basis. The "Swiss cheese" nature of the white spaces makes them unsuitable for licensed allocation, and licensing them would increase the risk that much of this spectrum remains unused, to the public's detriment. This proceeding is the only opportunity to access this unique spectrum with excellent propagation characteristics on an unlicensed basis.

In summary, the Coalition urges the FCC to adopt rules that allow flexible, widespread use of the white spaces and to confirm through independent testing that the proposed parameters will provide incumbents with the required protection. By adopting the Coalition's proposals, the FCC can ensure that the public receives the maximum benefit from the TV white spaces.

**I. The Coalition’s Proposal Will Enable the Use of Unlicensed Low Power Devices in the TV White Spaces**

In its opening comments, the Coalition recommended that the FCC set protection criteria and then confirm that devices submitted for certification meet these criteria, rather than mandating specific technologies. Specifically, the Coalition proposed allowing the use of personal/portable devices and permitting these devices to use spectrum sensing instead of less efficient or cumbersome interference avoidance mechanisms. This flexibility will best achieve the goals of encouraging innovation and protecting incumbents.

Many objections to flexible use of the white spaces are based on unrealistic assumptions about real-world device operations. For example, MSTV's results assume that white space devices will always transmit at maximum power through a 6 dBi antenna, which is 400 mW EIRP for a personal/portable device. However, the Coalition's proposal employs transmission power control (TPC), which can introduce up to 25 dB of attenuation depending on the received DTV signal strength in adjacent and nearby channels. Additionally, the device uses a 0 dBi antenna and transmits at the lowest power necessary for reliable communication. The output power is capped at 100 mW EIRP and can be as low as 1/3 of a milliwatt, approximately 1200 times less power than assumed by MSTV. The FCC should base its decision on an objective assessment of actual operating parameters rather than theoretical speculation.

The Coalition's proposal, developed through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis, addresses all concerns and questions raised by the FCC and commenters. It ensures that affordable devices can be built and the spectrum can be efficiently shared. The Coalition has invested significant time and resources to build and test prototype devices, and is confident that the FCC's independent testing will confirm the wisdom of its chosen operating parameters.

**A. Technical and Operational Parameters**

To eliminate confusion and facilitate the Coalition's rebuttal to comments objecting to portable unlicensed use of the TV white spaces, the method of operation of the proposed device is summarized below:

1. **Maximum Transmit Power**: 100 milliwatts EIRP (or 20 dBm EIRP) reduced by TPC as outlined.
2. **Lowest Power Required**: The device will transmit at the lowest power required for reliable communication.
3. **Transmission Power Control (TPC)**: TPC will dynamically reduce the transmitter EIRP between 0 dB and 25 dB according to the example algorithm.
4. **Antenna**: The transmit/receive antenna will be an omni-antenna with a maximum of 0 dBi gain.
5. **Excluded Channels**: The device will not operate in channels 2 through 20 and channel 37.
6. **Listen Before Talk Algorithm**: The device will employ a listen before talk algorithm.
7. **Channel Scanning**: Before operation, the device will scan all permitted channels (excluding 2 through 20 and 37) and identify those with a received power below -114 dBm as vacant.
8. **Transmission Duration**: The device will transmit in an identified vacant channel for no more than 400 milliseconds and cease transmission for at least 100 microseconds to avoid monopolizing the channel.
9. **Re-Scanning**: The device will re-scan every 60 seconds to re-determine channel vacancy.
10. **Out-of-Band Interference Limits**: The device will transmit within the bounds of the transmission mask shown in Figure 1, designed to eliminate harmful interference and maintain out-of-band limits.
