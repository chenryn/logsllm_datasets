SUMMARY 
As Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, and Philips (collectively the 
“Coalition”) said in their opening comments, the Commission can permit innovative uses 
of unoccupied television spectrum (the TV “white spaces”) while ensuring that 
incumbent licensees in these bands are protected from harmful interference.  Indeed, the 
Coalition explained in great detail the technical rules the Commission could adopt that 
would permit robust unlicensed use of the white spaces while protecting incumbent 
licensees.  The Coalition is now prepared physically to demonstrate that it is possible to 
permit such use of the white spaces while protecting incumbents.  It has designed, built, 
and made arrangements to submit to the Commission a prototype device for testing.  By 
contrast, opponents of white space use have submitted only conjecture and comments that 
make assumptions which do not reflect how real-world devices will operate.   
The one subject on which the record reflects near universal agreement is the need 
for the Commission to conduct objective testing to evaluate how devices will operate in 
the white spaces.  The Coalition enthusiastically supports rigorous testing by the 
Commission, and believes that this testing should be the touchstone of this proceeding.  
Indeed, the Coalition urges the Commission to give preference to those technical and 
operational proposals that are supported by devices that have been made available for the 
Commission to test.   
In its opening comments, the Coalition urged the Commission to authorize 
personal/portable devices concurrently with fixed devices, to allow personal/portable 
devices to employ spectrum sensing technology to avoid causing harmful interference to 
incumbent licensees, and to ensure that such devices are authorized on an unlicensed 
iii
basis.  This approach will maximize the benefits of the white spaces by enabling a range 
of innovative devices and services while protecting incumbents.  Accordingly, the 
Coalition urges the Commission to take the following actions as it formulates the final 
rules governing operation in the white spaces: 
First, the Commission’s rules should accommodate the Coalition’s proposed 
technical and operational parameters for a personal/portable spectrum sensing device.  
The Coalition encourages the Commission to test its prototype rigorously so that it can 
see for itself that these parameters will provide incumbents with the protection from 
harmful interference to which they are entitled.   
Second, the Commission should authorize personal/portable devices at the same 
time it authorizes fixed devices, if not before.  Those seeking to delay the introduction of 
personal/portable devices have claimed a need to learn more about how such devices will 
operate, but fixed device prototypes are not even available for the Commission to test.   
Finally, the Commission should reaffirm its initial decision to allocate the TV 
white spaces on an unlicensed basis.  The “Swiss cheese” nature of the white spaces 
makes them ill-suited to licensed allocation, and licensing them will increase 
substantially the risk that much of this spectrum will continue to lie fallow, to the 
detriment of the public.  While licensed use of TV spectrum will be realized in the 
upcoming DTV auction, this proceeding represents the only opportunity to access this 
unique spectrum—with its excellent propagation characteristics—on an unlicensed basis.  
In short, the Coalition urges the Commission to adopt rules that will allow 
flexible, widespread use of the white spaces, and to confirm through independent testing 
that the parameters proposed by the Coalition will provide incumbent licensees with the 
iv
protection to which they are entitled.  By adopting the proposals set forth by the Coalition 
in this proceeding, the Commission can ensure that the public receives the maximum 
benefit from the TV white spaces.

The core objective of this proceeding is to tap the nation’s unused television 
spectrum (the TV “white spaces”) to “benefit the public by allowing the development of 
new and innovative types of devices and services for businesses and consumers, without 
disrupting television and other authorized services.”1  Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, 
Intel, Microsoft, and Philips (collectively the “Coalition”) are committed to realizing this 
vision, and to ensuring that this spectrum is available to provide a variety of affordable 
broadband services to millions of underserved Americans.   
In its opening comments, the Coalition provided the Commission with a technical  
roadmap to reach these goals.2  It has now backed up its words by building a prototype 
which and making arrangements to submit it to the Commission for testing.  This device

will confirm that incumbent licensees can be protected by unlicensed devices from 
harmful interference.   
In contrast, some parties opposing flexible, widespread use of the white spaces 
have provided the Commission with nothing but misleading theoretical analysis and 
empirical studies.  These comments share one salient feature:  while paying lip service to 
the Commission’s objective of ensuring access to new innovative devices and services, 
they have focused instead on creating new unnecessary benefits for incumbent licensees, 
needlessly inhibiting use of the white spaces.  A  balance between the wishes of 
incumbents and encouraging innovation is required if the public is to realize the 
substantial value of this spectrum.   
Significantly, the one subject on which the record reflects near universal 
agreement is the need for the Commission to conduct objective testing to determine how 
much protection TV band devices must provide.3  The Coalition enthusiastically supports 
these calls for rigorous, independent testing, which should be the touchstone of this 
proceeding.  In particular, the Coalition urges the Commission to give preference to those 
technical and operational proposals supported by devices that have been made available 
for testing.  In this regard, the Coalition notes that its personal/portable prototype device 
incorporating spectrum sensing technology is, quite literally, the only option on the table 
for the Commission to test.

Finally, consistent with its original determination that the white space spectrum 
should be allocated on an unlicensed basis, the Commission should reject calls to license 
any portion of the white spaces.  Unlicensed use of the white spaces will provide 
substantial benefits for businesses, public safety, and consumers, furthering innovation 
and enabling widespread affordable broadband access.  While licensed use of TV 
spectrum will be realized in the upcoming DTV auction, this proceeding represents the 
only opportunity to access this unique spectrum—with its excellent propagation 
characteristics—on an unlicensed basis.     
In short, by adopting the technical and operational parameters proposed by the 
Coalition, concurrently authorizing the use of personal/portable and fixed/access devices, 
and allocating white space spectrum on an unlicensed basis, the Commission can: 
• Ensure technically and economically efficient utilization of unused beach front 
spectrum below 1 GHz. 
• Encourage innovation. 
• Provide economical broadband access and other services to public safety and first 
responders. 
• Enable a number of alternatives for economical broadband access in rural and 
other underserved areas via organic, low power mesh networks not dependent on 
significant infrastructure investment.    
• Make certain that TV spectrum can be accessed on an unlicensed basis (through 
the white spaces) as well as on licensed basis (through DTV auctions), allowing 
the public to realize the advantages of both regulatory models.    
I. 
THE COALITION’S PROPOSAL WILL ENABLE THE USE OF UNLICENSED LOW 
POWER DEVICES IN THE TV WHITE SPACES.   
In its opening comments, the Coalition urged the Commission not to mandate 
specific technologies that must be deployed in the white spaces, but rather to set 
protection criteria and then confirm that devices submitted for certification can meet this 
4
level of protection.4  Specifically, the Coalition recommended that the Commission 
permit the use of personal/portable devices, and allow these devices to use spectrum 
sensing rather than requiring less efficient or more cumbersome interference avoidance 
mechanisms.5  By giving industry the flexibility to address interference in a number of 
ways rather than selecting a specific interference avoidance technology, the Commission 
can best achieve its goals of encouraging innovation and protecting incumbents.  
Many of the objections raised by those opposing flexible use of the white spaces 
are based on unrealistic assumptions about how real-world devices, such as those 
proposed by the Coalition, will operate.  For example, the results presented by MSTV 
assume that the white space device will always transmit at maximum power through a 6 
dBi antenna (in other words, 400 mW Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (“EIRP”) 
for a personal/portable device).6  However, the proposal presented by the Coalition 
employs transmission power control (“TPC”), which will introduce up to 25 dB of 
attenuation depending on the received DTV signal strength in the adjacent and near 
channels.7  In addition, the device will use a 0 dBi antenna.  Finally, the device will 
transmit at the lowest power necessary to achieve reliable communication.  Therefore, to 
eliminate any possibility of interference, the output power of a Coalition device is capped 
at 100 mW EIRP, and can be as low as 1/3 of a milliwatt as appropriate—approximately 
1200 times less power than assumed by MSTV.  As this analysis demonstrates, the

Commission should base its decision on an objective assessment of actual operating 
parameters rather than theoretical speculation designed specifically to suggest that white 
space use is infeasible.   
The Coalition’s proposal, in a reasoned and practical manner, addresses all the 
concerns and questions voiced by the Commission as well as all legitimate issues raised 
by commenters.  In addition, it guarantees that affordable devices can be built and the 
spectrum can be efficiently shared.  This proposal is the result of thousands of hours of 
theoretical and empirical analysis carried out by Coalition staff.  The Coalition has 
invested the time and resources to build prototype devices.  It has extensively tested and 
refined its designs.  This intensive scientific approach led to the proposal the Coalition 
made in its comments and the further elaboration discussed below.  It guarantees that 
incumbent licensees will be protected from harmful interference.  Indeed, the Coalition is 
so certain of its analysis that it is the only participant in the docket who responded to the 
Commission’s request for a prototype device to test. The Coalition is confident that the 
Commission’s independent and expert testing of its prototype will confirm the wisdom of 
the Coalition’s choice of operating parameters.  
A. 
Technical and Operational Parameters.   
To eliminate any confusion and to facilitate the Coalition’s rebuttal to comments 
filed in the docket objecting to portable unlicensed use of the TV white spaces, the 
method of operation of the proposed device is summarized below:  
1. Maximum transmit power will be 100 milliwatts EIRP (or 20 dBm EIRP) reduced 
by Transmission Power Control (“TPC”) as outlined below.  
2. First, in all situations the device will transmit at the lowest power required for 
reliable communication.    
6
3. Second, TPC will dynamically reduce the transmitter EIRP between 0 dB and 25 
dB according to the example algorithm described below. 
4. The transmit/receive antenna will be an omni-antenna with a maximum of 0 dBi 
gain. 
5. The device will not operate in channels 2 through 20 and channel 37. 
6. The device will employ a listen before talk algorithm.  
7. Before operation, the device will scan all permitted channels (2 through 20 and 37 
omitted) and will identify those channels with a received power below -114 dBm 
as vacant. 
8. The device will transmit in an identified vacant channel for no more than 400 
milliseconds, and will cease transmission on that channel for at least 100 
microseconds so as not to monopolize the channel. 
9. The device will re-scan every 60 seconds to re-determine channel vacancy. 
10. To make certain that out-of-band interference limits are maintained, the device 
will transmit within the bounds of the transmission mask shown in Figure 1.  This 
spectral mask (based on average power measurements in 500 kHz), combined 
with the rules described below, is designed to eliminate harmful interference and
