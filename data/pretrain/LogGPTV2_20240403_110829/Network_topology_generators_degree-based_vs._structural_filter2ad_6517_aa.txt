## Abstract
The widely accepted belief that the Internet is hierarchical has led to the development of network topology generators, such as Transit-Stub and Tiers, which create networks with a deliberately hierarchical structure. However, in 1999, Faloutsos et al. revealed that the Internet's degree distribution follows a power-law. Since the Transit-Stub and Tiers generators do not produce power-law degree distributions, they have been largely dismissed by the research community. New generators have been proposed to better match the power-law degree distribution.

This paper challenges the current focus on local properties (like degree distribution) and argues that it is more important for network generators to accurately model the large-scale structure of the Internet, such as its hierarchical nature. Using various topology metrics, we evaluate which generators better represent this large-scale structure. Surprisingly, we find that degree-based generators more accurately capture the large-scale structure of measured topologies. We then investigate the nature of hierarchy in these degree-based generators and find that they produce a form of hierarchy that closely resembles the loosely hierarchical nature of the Internet.

## 1. Introduction
Network protocols are designed to be independent of the underlying network topology. However, topology can significantly impact protocol performance. Therefore, researchers often use network topology generators to create realistic topologies for simulations. These generators aim to create topologies that embody the fundamental characteristics of real networks, rather than exact replicas.

The first widely used topology generator was developed by Waxman [48], a variant of the Erdős-Rényi random graph, with link creation probabilities biased by Euclidean distance. Later, the Transit-Stub [10] and Tiers [14] generators, which emphasize hierarchical structure, became popular. In 1999, Faloutsos et al. [17] showed that the degree distribution of the Internet is a power-law, leading to the development of new generators focused on matching this property.

This paper starts with the premise that it is more important for topology generators to accurately model the large-scale structure of the Internet, such as its hierarchical nature, rather than its local properties like the degree distribution. We explore the implications of this belief by comparing degree-based and structural generators using various topology metrics.

## 2. Related Work
Several important areas of related work include the Waxman, Transit-Stub, and Tiers topology generators, and Faloutsos et al.'s observations of power-law degree distributions in the Internet. Recent degree-based generators [23, 28, 2, 31, 1] attempt to generate networks with power-law degree distributions but differ in how nodes are connected.

Zegura et al. [51] explored various properties of random graphs and structural generators. Barabási et al. [3] quantified the attack and error tolerance of random graphs and real-world "scale-free" networks. Van Mieghem et al. [45] showed that the Internet's hop count distribution is well modeled by a random graph with uniformly or exponentially assigned link weights.

Medina et al. [29] compared random graph generators, hierarchical generators, and degree-based generators, concluding that the BRITE generator [28] was better at modeling the Internet based on degree and degree-rank exponents. Bu and Towsley [8] found that degree-based generators differ in their clustering coefficients, and Vukadinovic et al. [46] evaluated the Laplacian eigenvalue spectrum of various graphs.

## 3. Networks and Metrics
We analyze three categories of network graphs: measured networks, generated networks, and canonical networks.

### 3.1. Measured Networks
We use two measured network topologies:
1. **AS Topology:** Represents inter-autonomous system (AS) connectivity, derived from AS path information in backbone BGP routing tables. Nodes represent ASs, and links represent peering relationships.
2. **Router-Level (RL) Topology:** Derived by inferring router adjacencies from traceroutes to carefully chosen sections of the IP address space. Nodes represent routers, and links connect routers that are one IP-level hop from each other.

These topologies reflect Internet connectivity at different scales. The AS topology abstracts many details of physical connectivity, while the RL topology captures finer-grained router-level connections. Despite these differences, both topologies exhibit similar properties with respect to our topology metrics.

Both topologies are incomplete to varying degrees, potentially missing some nodes and adjacencies. Nonetheless, they provide valuable insights into the large-scale structure of the Internet.

## 4. Results and Discussion
Using a set of three topology metrics, we compare the generated and measured networks. Our results suggest that:
1. The AS and RL graphs have similar properties, contrary to expectations.
2. Degree-based generators are significantly better at representing the large-scale properties of the Internet at both the AS and router levels than structural generators.

To resolve this paradox, we investigate the nature of hierarchy in degree-based generators and find that they produce a form of hierarchy that closely resembles the loosely hierarchical nature of the Internet.

## 5. Conclusion
Our findings support the prevailing wisdom that degree-based generators are better models for Internet topologies. However, these generators are better models not just because they imitate the degree distribution but because this distribution, combined with the fairly random connection of nodes, leads to a loose form of hierarchy that accurately reflects the Internet's large-scale structure.
