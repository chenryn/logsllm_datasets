ABSTRACT
Following the long-held belief that the Internet is hierarchical, the
network topology generators most widely used by the Internet re-
search community, Transit-Stub and Tiers, create networks with
a deliberately hierarchical structure. However, in 1999 a seminal
paper by Faloutsos et al. revealed that the Internet’s degree distri-
bution is a power-law. Because the degree distributions produced
by the Transit-Stub and Tiers generators are not power-laws, the
research community has largely dismissed them as inadequate and
proposed new network generators that attempt to generate graphs
with power-law degree distributions.
Contrary to much of the current literature on network topology
generators, this paper starts with the assumption that it is more im-
portant for network generators to accurately model the large-scale
structure of the Internet (such as its hierarchical structure) than to
faithfully imitate its local properties (such as the degree distribu-
tion). The purpose of this paper is to determine, using various
topology metrics, which network generators better represent this
large-scale structure. We ﬁnd, much to our surprise, that network
generators based on the degree distribution more accurately cap-
ture the large-scale structure of measured topologies. We then seek
an explanation for this result by examining the nature of hierarchy

INTRODUCTION
Network protocols are (or at least should be) designed to be in-
dependent of the underlying network topology. However, while
topology should have no effect on the correctness of network pro-
tocols, topology sometimes has a major impact on the performance
of network protocols. For this reason, network researchers often
use network topology generators to generate realistic topologies
for their simulations.1 These topology generators do not aspire to
produce exact replicas of the current Internet; instead, they merely
attempt to create network topologies that embody the fundamental
characteristics of real networks.
The ﬁrst network topology generator to become widely used in
protocol simulations was developed by Waxman [48]. This gen-
erator is a variant of the classical Erdos-Renyi random graph [6];
its link creation probabilities are biased by Euclidean distance be-
tween the link endpoints. A later line of research, noting that real
network topologies have a non-random structure, emphasized the
fundamental role of hierarchy. The following from [51] reﬂects
this observation:
1It should be noted that sometimes topology generators are used
to tickle subtle bugs in protocols. However, for this purpose the
emphasis is not on ﬁnding realistic topologies but on ﬁnding hard
cases.
147...the primary structural characteristic affecting the paths
between nodes in the Internet is the distinction be-
tween stub and transit domains... In other words, there
is a hierarchy imposed on nodes...
This reasoning quickly became accepted wisdom and, for many
years, the network generators resulting from this line of research,
Transit-Stub [10] and Tiers [14], were considered state-of-the-art.
In what follows, we will refer to these as structural generators be-
cause of their focus on the hierarchical structure of networks.
These structural generators reigned supreme until the appearance
of a seminal paper by Faloutsos et al. [17] in 1999. In that paper,
the authors used measurements of the router-level and AS-level In-
ternet graphs—the former having routers as nodes and the latter
having ASs as nodes—to investigate (among other issues) the node
degree, which is the number of connections a node has. They found
that the degree distributions of these graphs are power-laws.2
The aforementioned structural generators do not produce power-
law degree distributions. Many in the ﬁeld seem to have concluded
that this disparity, by itself, proved that structural generators were
unsuitable models for the Internet. Subsequently, there have been
an increasing number of proposals for topology generators that are
designed primarily to match the Internet’s degree distribution and
do not attempt to model the Internet’s hierarchical structure; for
example, see [23, 28, 2, 31, 1, 8]. These degree-based topology
generators embody the implicit assumption that it is more important
to match a certain local property—the degree distribution—than to
capture the large-scale hierarchical structure of the Internet. The
rapid adoption of these degree-based generators suggests that this
belief, while not often explicitly stated, is widely held.
This paper starts with a very different premise. We believe that it
is more important for topology generators to accurately model the
large-scale structure of the Internet (such as its hierarchical struc-
ture) than to faithfully reproduce its local properties (such as the
degree distribution). In particular, we believe that the scaling per-
formance of protocols will be more effected by these large-scale
structures than by purely local properties.
While we cannot prove the correctness of our belief, this paper is
devoted to exploring its implications. That is, we wish to determine
which topology generators—degree-based or structural—produce
better models of the large-scale structure of the Internet. Some
have argued that this question is vacuous, because networks that do
not match local properties of the Internet cannot possibly match its
large-scale structure. But we claim the two properties—local and
global—are separable. Consider, for example, a tertiary tree, a two-
dimensional grid, and degree-four random network; each of these
networks have exactly the same degree distribution (all nodes hav-
ing degree four) but they obviously have very different large-scale
structure. Similarly, one can deﬁne trees with any desired degree
distribution (in particular, the one matching the Internet’s degree
distribution), and yet not alter the tree-like large-scale structure.
Thus, we believe, in contrast to much of the research commu-
nity, that it is still an open question as to which network topology
generators best model the Internet. This paper is devoted to ad-
dressing this issue. More speciﬁcally, after reviewing related work
in Section 2, this paper proceeds to ask two questions.
2There is some disagreement about whether these are true power
laws or are Weibull distributions or perhaps something else. For
our purposes we don’t care about the exact mathematical form of
the distribution, merely that it can be closely approximated by a
power-law or similar very long-tailed distributions.
Question #1 Which generated networks most closely model the
large-scale structure of the Internet? To answer this question we
must ﬁrst determine what the Internet is and then decide how to
measure the degree of resemblance between it and the generated
networks. As we describe in Section 3.1 we use two representa-
tions of the Internet. The ﬁrst representation is at the Autonomous
System (AS) level, where ASs are nodes and edges represent peer-
ing relationships between ASs. We use BGP routing tables to de-
rive the AS graph. The second representation is at the router level,
where routers are nodes and an edge indicates that the correspond-
ing routers are separated by one IP-level hop. The router graph
comes from the SCAN project [20] which uses a series of tracer-
oute measurements to map the Internet. The router graph represents
the Internet at a much ﬁner level of granularity, and has roughly 17
times more nodes and links than the AS-level graph. While they
both are representations of the Internet, it isn’t clear that, as graphs,
they would have much in common. Thus, we consider these two
measured graphs as distinct entities in our analysis, and separately
ask which generated networks most resemble the AS-level graph
and which most resemble the router-level graph. We should note
that the structural topology generators were originally intended to
model the router-level graphs, while the degree-based generators
were not explicitly targeted at one or the other level of granularity.
Even though our topology data is the best we could obtain, it is
clear that both of these measured graphs—the AS graph and the
router graph—are far from perfect representations of the Internet.
Not only are they subject to errors and omissions, but they also
only reﬂect the topology and do not contain any information about
the speed of the links. We do, however, approximately model an
aspect of reality that has been shown to impact path lengths [43,
38] in Internet topologies—policy routing.
To measure the properties of the Internet graphs and the gener-
ated graphs, we use a set of three topology metrics described in
Section 3.2. These metrics are intended to capture the large-scale
structure of networks. Our methodology for picking these metrics
was simple and, admittedly, ad-hoc. We computed eight different
topology metrics (either reported in the literature or of our own
deﬁnition) on the network topologies. Of these, we ﬁnd that three
basic metrics maximally distinguish our topologies: the addition of
more metrics does not further distinguish between our topologies,
but the removal of one or more of these three blurs some distinc-
tions. Thus, the conclusions we draw are supported by all eight
metrics (not all of our own design), but can be presented with only
three of them. For space reasons, we present these basic three met-
rics and refer the reader to [42] for a complete discussion of all
metrics.
While we are not aware of extensive prior work in the design of
metrics to measure large-scale network properties, and while we
have borrowed liberally from the work that exists, we fully rec-
ognize that our metrics may not adequately characterize network
topologies and that additional work is urgently needed in this area.
Moreover, the distinctions we draw from these metrics are rather
qualitative in nature (we often are left asking do these curves have
roughly the same shape?) and thus are subject to different interpre-
tations.
These caveats notwithstanding, we use these metrics to compare
the generated and measured networks. Our results, presented in
Section 4 and augmented by additional results [42], suggest two
ﬁndings. First, we ﬁnd that the AS and router graphs have similar
properties. One might expect (as did we) that, since they describe
the Internet at such different levels, the AS and router graphs would
have quite different characteristics; our results indicate otherwise.
Second, we ﬁnd that the degree generators are signiﬁcantly better
148at representing the large-scale properties of the Internet, at both the
AS and router levels, than the structural generators. Since our met-
rics measure large-scale structure and the degree generators focus
only on very local properties, we expected the structural generators
would easily be superior; again, our results indicate otherwise. This
leaves us with the seeming paradox that while the Internet certainly
has hierarchy, it appears that the large-scale structure of the Inter-
net graphs is better modeled by network generators that completely
ignore hierarchy! Resolving this paradox leads us to our second
question.
Question #2 Do the degree-based generator produce networks
with hierarchy and, if so, how? In Section 5 we introduce a mea-
sure of hierarchy, and use it to investigate the nature of hierarchy in
the generated and measured graphs. We ﬁnd that while the degree-
based generators do not explicitly inject hierarchy into the network,
the power-law nature of the degree distribution results in a sub-
stantial level of hierarchy—not as strict as the hierarchy present in
structural generators, but signiﬁcantly more hierarchical than, say,
random graphs. This relatively loose form of hierarchy, produced
merely by the presence of the power-law degree distribution, more
accurately reﬂects the nature of hierarchy in the Internet than the
strict hierarchy produced by the structural generators.
In summary, then, we ﬁnd that the prevailing wisdom that degree-
based generators are better models for Internet topologies, to which
we had taken exception, is indeed correct. However, these degree-
based generators are better models of the Internet not just because
they slavishly imitate the degree-distribution but because this de-
gree distribution (and the fairly random connection of nodes) leads
to a loose form of hierarchy very similar to that in the Internet.
2. RELATED WORK
We have already mentioned several important areas of related
work:
the Waxman, Transit-Stub and Tiers topology generators,
and Faloutsos et al.’s observations of power-law degree distribu-
tions in the Internet. We have also mentioned in passing several
new degree-based generators [23, 28, 2, 31, 1]. They all attempt
to generate networks with power-law degree distributions, but dif-
fer in the way in which nodes are connected. We describe some of
these generators in slightly more detail in [42].
Perhaps closest in spirit to the work presented in this paper is the
pioneering exploration of topology properties by Zegura et al. [51].
Their study considered various properties (biconnectivity and var-
ious kinds of network diameters) of random graphs (and variants
thereof) and structural generators. We follow their lead but ex-
tend their study using a larger collection of metrics, adding mea-
sured networks and degree-based generators, and explicitly ana-
lyzing the degree of hierarchy. More recently, Barabasi et al. [3]
have attempted to quantify the attack and error tolerance of random
graphs and real-world “scale-free” networks. Finally, van Mieghem
et al. [45] have shown that the Internet’s hop count distribution
(the distribution of path lengths in hops) is well modeled by that
of a random graph with uniformly or exponentially assigned link
weights. Some of the topology metrics used in our paper are based
on the metrics introduced in these papers.
Also directly relevant is the work of Medina et al. [29]. They too
compare random graph generators (such as Waxman), and hierar-
chical generators (such as Transit-Stub) to degree-based generators
(such as the BRITE generator [28]). Their metrics for compari-
son include the tests in [17] for power law exponents of the de-
gree distribution, the degree rank, the hop-plot and the eigenvalue
distribution. They conclude that the degree and degree-rank ex-
ponents are the best discriminators between topologies among the
metrics they considered. Using these metrics, they conclude that
the BRITE generator was better than the Transit-Stub and Waxman
generators in modeling the Internet. However, using the degree and
degree-rank exponents as metrics means that topologies are evalu-
ated solely on how well their degree distribution matches the degree
distribution of the Internet. It is well known that Transit-Stub and
other structural generators do not produce power-law degree distri-
butions, and so it is no mystery that BRITE and other degree-based
generators do a better job of matching the degree and degree-ranked
exponents. However, the question we pose in this paper is: which
class of generators most closely resemble the Internet when look-
ing at the large-scale properties of the Internet? We believe this
question has not been addressed by the work in [29] or elsewhere
in the literature because networks with similar degree distributions
can have very different large-scale properties (Section 1).
Two other recent pieces of work examine local properties of net-
work topologies. Bu and Towsley [8] ﬁnd that degree-based gener-
ators differ signiﬁcantly in their clustering coefﬁcients [47]. Their
work proposes an alternative degree-based generator that more closely
matches the clustering behavior of the measured AS graph. For
completeness, we have incorporated both the clustering metric and
the proposed generator in our analyses (Section 4). Vukadinovic et
al. [46] evaluate the Laplacian eigenvalue spectrum of a variety of
graphs, and conclude that the multiplicity of eigenvalues of value 1
differentiates AS graphs from grids and random trees. However, as
claimed in [46], this measure of the spectrum reﬂects purely local
properties of the graph (the number of degree 1 nodes, the number
of nodes attached to degree 1 nodes etc.), while our work focuses
on the large-scale structure. However, their result is consistent with
our ﬁndings (and with the commonly held intuition that the AS
graph is neither mesh-like nor tree-like).
Also relevant to our work is recent work on the analysis of graph
measurements. Broido and Claffy [7] ﬁnd that various properties
of real-world graphs, including the degree distribution, are well-
modeled by a Weibull distribution. Using extensive measurements
of the AS graph, Chang et al. [12] show that the degree distribution
of the AS graph deviates signiﬁcantly from a strict power-law ﬁt.
As we have discussed in Section 1, our work merely assumes that
the degree distribution is well approximated by a heavy tail and
does not depend on the exact mathematical form of the distribution.
Finally, Magoni et al. [27] study various graph theoretic and time
evolution properties of the AS topology.
Our work would not have been possible without developments
in Internet router-level topology discovery. Early work in this area
used traceroutes from a small set of sources to several thousand
hosts to compute a router-level map [32]. Subsequent work im-
proved the coverage of the Internet address space by randomly se-
lecting IP addresses [39], randomly selecting addresses from route
entries in BGP tables [9], using a precomputed set of Web sites [13],
or using heuristics to infer addressable parts of the IP space [20].
This last work also documents several techniques for improving
completeness of the inferred topologies.
Several papers have addressed the impact of topology on pro-
tocol performance. For example, Phillips et al. [35] showed that
graphs with exponentially increasing neighborhood sizes (i.e., num-
ber of nodes within a certain radius increases exponentially with ra-
dius) approximately obey the Chuang-Sirbu multicast scaling law.
In closely related work, Almeroth and Chambers [11] considered a
variety of metrics for the efﬁciency of multicast trees. Wong and
Katz [49] found that the amount of multicast state from randomly
placed receivers differs qualitatively with different topologies. Ra-
doslavov et al. [36] found similar results for other kinds of protocol
performance questions.
149Although there is a large literature on routing hierarchies, we are
not aware of much work that has attempted to measure (as opposed
to create, or utilize) hierarchy in network topologies. Two notable,
and related, examples [18, 40], describe techniques for inferring hi-
erarchical relationships (e.g., provider-customer) in the AS topol-
ogy. The latter work also classiﬁes ASs into a ﬁve-level hierarchy.
Somewhat orthogonal to the questions considered in this paper
is recent work attempting to explain the origin of power-law degree
distributions. Ferrer i Cancho et al. [22] and Fabrikant et al. [16]
have independently shown that, under certain conditions, power-
law degree distributions can arise as a consequence of optimizing
an objective function. Tangmunarunkit et al. [41] argue that, for
the AS graph, the high variability of the degree distribution follows
from the high variability of the distribution of AS sizes.
There has also been signiﬁcant work in the non-networking lit-
erature exploring the properties of real-world networks. We do not
intend to be exhaustive in our coverage of this work, but will men-
tion some oft-referenced work. Watts and Strogatz [47] found that
many real-world networks, such as the actor collaboration network
and a section of the power grid, are well-modeled by the small-
world phenomenon. Kleinberg et al. [25] analyzed properties of
the World-Wide Web graph and proposed a new family of random
graph models. Aiello et al. [1] proposed a random graph model for
massive graphs and showed that this model captures some aspects
of the AT&T call graph. Our work has been inﬂuenced by some of
this work, but focuses primarily on communication network topolo-
gies.
3. NETWORKS AND METRICS
We now describe the topology generators and measured networks
we analyze, and the set of topology metrics we use to do so.
3.1 Networks
We analyze three categories of network graphs: measured net-
works, generated networks, and canonical networks.
3.1.1 Measured Networks
We use two measured network topologies. Our ﬁrst is the AS
topology, representing inter-autonomous system (AS) connectivity,
obtained from AS path information in backbone BGP routing ta-
bles. Nodes in this topology represent ASs, and links represent
peering relationships between them. The particular topology we
present in this paper was obtained from the Route Views archive
(routeviews.org).
Our second measured topology is the Internet router-level (RL)
topology. This is derived by inferring router adjacencies [20] in
the Internet from traceroutes to carefully chosen sections of the
IP address space. Nodes in this topology represent routers, and
links connect routers that are one IP-level hop from each other. In
passing, we note that this deﬁnition of a link does not distinguish
shared media from point-to-point links. The former usually appear
as completely connected subgraphs in the network topology.
Although these topologies are related, they reﬂect Internet con-
nectivity at rather different scales. For example, the AS topology
abstracts many details of physical connectivity between ASs and
each AS represents a grouping of several (sometimes hundreds)
topologically contiguous routers. Thus, these two graphs could
have had very different properties, but, as we show in Section 4,
they behave quite similarly with respect to our topology metrics.
Both these topologies are incomplete, to different degrees. They
may not capture all the nodes in the network and, for the nodes
that do appear in the topology, they may not include all adjacencies
