I have a "dynamic" component that is loaded through a
`DynamicComponentLoader`. In that dynamic component I'm trying to set a
template variable. But for some reason this doesn't seem to get parsed by
Angular. Eventhough the exact same thing works fine from the "main" component.
Here is an example of my problem:

You should see two texts. A text in a `h2` tag, which has a dynamic `id`
attribute. This `id` attribute is successfully parsed
Then the `Dynamic` component is loaded underneath that `h2` element. The `div`
that says **_I should have a dynamic ID** _ has no `id` attribute anymore. For
some reason the variable isn't parsed. Even worse, the entire `id` tag
disappeared.
Bug?
