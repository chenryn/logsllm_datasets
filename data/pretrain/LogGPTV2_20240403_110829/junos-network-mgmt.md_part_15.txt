Configuring IEEE 802.3ah OAM on an ACX Series Router | 142
Junos OS for ACX Series routers allows the Ethernet interfaces on these routers to support the IEEE
802.3ah standard for the Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) of Ethernet in access
networks. The standard defines OAM link fault management (LFM). You can configure IEEE 802.3ah
OAM LFM on point-to-point Ethernet links that are connected either directly or through Ethernet
repeaters.
This example describes how to enable and configure OAM on a Gigabit Ethernet interface.
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• Junos OS Release 12.2 or later for ACX Series routers.
• An ACX1000 or ACX2000 router.
142
Overview and Topology
In this example, you configure a 10-Gigabit Ethernet interface on an ACX Series router with 802.3ah
OAM support, which includes: link discovery, protocol data units (PDUs), remote loopback, negotiation,
and event thresholds.

CLI Quick Configuration
To quickly configure IEEE 802.3ah Ethernet OAM, copy the following commands and paste them into
the CLI:
edit
edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management
set interface xe-0/0/0 link-discovery active pdu-interval 800 pdu-threshold 4 remote-loopback
negotiation-options allow-remote-loopback
set interface xe-0/0/0 event-thresholds frame-error 30 frame-period 50 frame-period-summary 40
symbol-period 20
Procedure
Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure IEEE 802.3ah OAM support on an interface:
1. Enable IEEE 802.3ah OAM support on an interface:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management]
user@router1# set interface (OAM Link-Fault Management) xe-0/0/0
143
2. Specify that the interface initiates the discovery process by setting the link discovery mode to
active:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 link-discovery active
3. Set the periodic OAM PDU-sending interval (in milliseconds) to 800:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 pdu-interval 800
4. Define the number of OAM PDUs to miss before an error is logged as 4:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 pdu-threshold 4
5. Configure the remote interface into loopback mode so that all frames except OAM PDUs are
looped back without any changes:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 remote-loopback
6. Configure remote loopback support for the local interface:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 negotiation-options allow-remote-loopback
7. Set the threshold count for sending frame error events to 30:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 event-thresholds frame-error 30
8. Set the threshold count for sending frame period error events to 50:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 event-thresholds frame-period 50
9. Configure the threshold count for sending frame period summary error events to 40:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 event-thresholds frame-period-summary 40
10. Set the threshold count for sending symbol period events to 20:
user@router# set interface xe-0/0/0 event-thresholds symbol-period 20

Example: Configuring Ethernet LFM Between Provider Edge and Customer Edge
In this example, LFM is enabled on an IP link between the provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE)
interfaces. If the link goes down, the fault will be detected by LFM and the interfaces on both sides will
be marked Link-Layer-Down. This results in notifications to various subsystems (for example, routing)
which will take appropriate action.
The link running LFM is shown in Figure 13 on page 145.

To configure Ethernet LFM on an IP link between PE and CE interfaces:
1. Configure LFM on the PE router:

interface ge-1/1/0 {
pdu-interval 1000;
pdu-threshold 5;
}
}
}

}
}
2. Configure LFM on the CE router:
[edit]
interfaces ge-1/1/0 {
unit 0 {
family inet {

Example: Configuring Ethernet LFM for CCC
In this example, LFM is configured between two PEs (PE1 and PE2) connected using CCC. With LFM in
place, a link fault will be detected immediately, instead of depending on routing protocols to find the
fault on end-to-end CCC connection. This also helps in detecting the exact failed link instead of only
finding that the end-to-end CCC connectivity has failed. Also, because LFM runs at the link-layer level, it
does not need a IP address to operate and so can be used where bidirectional fault detection (BFD)
cannot.

The links running LFM are shown in Figure 14 on page 147

Example: Configuring Ethernet LFM for Aggregated Ethernet
In this example, LFM is configured on an aggregated Ethernet interface (AE0) between Router 1 and
Router 2. When configured on aggregated Ethernet, LFM runs on all the individual member links. LFM is
enabled or disabled on the member links as they are added or deleted from the aggregation group. The
status of individual links is used to determine the status of the aggregated interface.
The use of LFM with aggregated Ethernet is shown in Figure 15 on page 148.

Configuring an OAM Action Profile
You can create an action profile to define event fault flags and thresholds and the action to be taken.
You can then apply the action profile to one or more interfaces.
To configure an action profile, include the action-profile statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-
fault-management] hierarchy level:
action-profile profile-name {
action {
syslog;
link-down;
send-critical-event;
}
event {
link-adjacency-loss;
link-event-rate {
frame-error count;
frame-period count;
frame-period-summary count;
symbol-period count;
}
protocol-down;
}
}
NOTE: Starting from Junos OS Release 14.2, whenever link-fault management (LFM) with an
action profile is configured to mark the interface as down (by including the link-down statement
at the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management] hierarchy level), the port is placed in
the blocked state (STP state). In such a state of the interface, data traffic is not transmitted out
on that interface. Because the connectivity-fault management (CFM) downstream maintenance
MEPs come up on blocked ports, the CFM sessions come up properly. However, the interface is
down and the interface status TLV does not contain the correct status. Only if you configure the
port status TLV, the actual status of the port is reflected. The interface status TLV does not carry
the actual state of the port.

Specifying the Actions to Be Taken for Link-Fault Management Events
You can specify the action to be taken by the system when the configured link-fault event occurs.
Multiple action profiles can be applied to a single interface. For each action-profile, at least one event
and one action must be specified. The actions are taken only when all of the events in the action profile
are true. If more than one action is specified, all the actions are executed.
You might want to set a lower threshold for a specific action such as logging the error and set a higher
threshold for another action such as sending a critical event TLV.
To specify the action, include the action statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management
action-profile profile-name] hierarchy level:
[edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management action-profile profile-name]
event {
link-adjacency-loss;
protocol-down;
}
action {
syslog;
link-down;
send-critical-event;
}
