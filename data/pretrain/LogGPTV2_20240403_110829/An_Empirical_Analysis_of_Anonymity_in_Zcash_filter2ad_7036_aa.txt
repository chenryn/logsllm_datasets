Abstract
Among the now numerous alternative cryptocurren-
cies derived from Bitcoin, Zcash is often touted as the
one with the strongest anonymity guarantees, due to its
basis in well-regarded cryptographic research.
In this
paper, we examine the extent to which anonymity is
achieved in the deployed version of Zcash. We investi-
gate all facets of anonymity in Zcash’s transactions, rang-
ing from its transparent transactions to the interactions
with and within its main privacy feature, a shielded pool
that acts as the anonymity set for users wishing to spend
coins privately. We conclude that while it is possible to
use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its
anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuris-
tics based on identiﬁable patterns of usage.

Introduction
Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008 [34], cryptocur-
rencies have become increasingly popular to the point of
reaching a near-mania, with thousands of deployed cryp-
tocurrencies now collectively attracting trillions of dol-
lars in investment. While the broader positive potential
of “blockchain” (i.e., the public decentralized ledger un-
derlying almost all cryptocurrencies) is still unclear, de-
spite the growing number of legitimate users there are
today still many people using these cryptocurrencies for
less legitimate purposes. These range from the purchase
of drugs or other illicit goods on so-called dark markets
such as Dream Market, to the payments from victims
in ransomware attacks such as WannaCry, with many
other crimes in between. Criminals engaged in these
activities may be drawn to Bitcoin due to the relatively
low friction of making international payments using only
pseudonyms as identiﬁers, but the public nature of its
ledger of transactions raises the question of how much
anonymity is actually being achieved.
Indeed, a long line of research [37, 38, 12, 27, 40] has
by now demonstrated that the use of pseudonymous ad-
dresses in Bitcoin does not provide any meaningful level
of anonymity. Beyond academic research, companies
now provide analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain as a busi-
ness [19]. This type of analysis was used in several ar-
rests associated with the takedown of Silk Road [20], and
to identify the attempts of the WannaCry hackers to move
their ransom earnings from Bitcoin into Monero [17].
Perhaps in response to this growing awareness that
most cryptocurrencies do not have strong anonymity
guarantees, a number of alternative cryptocurrencies or
other privacy-enhancing techniques have been deployed
with the goal of improving on these guarantees. The
most notable cryptocurrencies that fall into this former
category are Dash [2] (launched in January 2014), Mon-
ero [3] (April 2014), and Zcash [7] (October 2016). At
the time of this writing all have a market capitalization of
over 1 billion USD [1], although this ﬁgure is notoriously
volatile, so should be taken with a grain of salt.
Even within this category of privacy-enhanced cryp-
tocurrencies, and despite its relative youth, Zcash stands
somewhat on its own. From an academic perspective,
Zcash is backed by highly regarded research [28, 13],
and thus comes with seemingly strong anonymity guar-
antees.
Indeed, the original papers cryptographically
prove the security of the main privacy feature of Zcash
(known as the shielded pool), in which users can spend
shielded coins without revealing which coins they have
spent. These strong guarantees have attracted at least
some criminal attention to Zcash: the underground mar-
ketplace AlphaBay was on the verge of accepting it be-
fore their shutdown in July 2017 [11], and the Shadow
Brokers hacking group started accepting Zcash in May
2017 (and in fact for their monthly dumps accepted ex-
clusively Zcash in September 2017) [16].
Despite these theoretical privacy guarantees, the de-
ployed version of Zcash does not require all transac-
tions to take place within the shielded pool itself:
it
also supports so-called transparent transactions, which
are essentially the same as transactions in Bitcoin in

that they reveal the pseudonymous addresses of both the
senders and recipients, and the amount being sent.
It
does require, however, that all newly generated coins
pass through the shielded pool before being spent fur-
ther, thus ensuring that all coins have been shielded at
least once. This requirement led the Zcash developers
to conclude that the anonymity set for users spending
shielded coins is in fact all generated coins, and thus
that “the mixing strategies that other cryptocurrencies
use for anonymity provide a rather small [anonymity set]
in comparison to Zcash” and that “Zcash has a distinct
advantage in terms of transaction privacy” [9].
In this paper, we provide the ﬁrst in-depth empirical
analysis of anonymity in Zcash, in order to examine these
claims and more generally provide a longitudinal study
of how Zcash has evolved and who its main participants
are. We begin in Section 4 by providing a general exam-
ination of the Zcash blockchain, from which we observe
that the vast majority of Zcash activity is in the transpar-
ent part of the blockchain, meaning it does not engage
with the shielded pool at all. In Section 5, we explore this
aspect of Zcash by adapting the analysis that has already
been developed for Bitcoin, and ﬁnd that exchanges typ-
ically dominate this part of the blockchain.
We then move in Section 6 to examining interactions
with the shielded pool. We ﬁnd that, unsurprisingly, the
main actors doing so are the founders and miners, who
are required to put all newly generated coins directly into
it. Using newly developed heuristics for attributing trans-
actions to founders and miners, we ﬁnd that 65.6% of
the value withdrawn from the pool can be linked back
to deposits made by either founders or miners. We also
implement a general heuristic for linking together other
types of transactions, and capture an additional 3.5% of
the value using this. Our relatively simple heuristics thus
reduce the size of the overall anonymity set by 69.1%.
In Section 7, we then look at the relatively small per-
centage of transactions that have taken place within the
shielded pool. Here, we ﬁnd (perhaps unsurprisingly)
that relatively little information can be inferred, although
we do identify certain patterns that may warrant further
investigation. Finally, we perform a small case study of
the activities of the Shadow Brokers within Zcash in Sec-
tion 8, and in Section 9 we conclude.
All of our results have been disclosed, at the time of
the paper’s submission, to the creators of Zcash, and dis-
cussed extensively with them since. This has resulted
in changes to both their public communication about
Zcash’s anonymity as well as the transactional behavior
of the founders. Additionally, all the code for our analy-
sis is available as an open-source repository.1

2 Related work
We consider as related all work that has focused on the
anonymity of cryptocurrencies, either by building so-
lutions to achieve stronger anonymity guarantees or by
demonstrating its limits.
In terms of the former, there has been a signiﬁcant
volume of research in providing solutions for existing
cryptocurrencies that allow interested users to mix their
coins in a way that achieves better anonymity than reg-
ular transactions [15, 41, 21, 24, 39, 14, 22, 25]. An-
other line of research has focused on producing alterna-
tive privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies. Most notably,
Dash [2] incorporates the techniques of CoinJoin [24] in
its PrivateSpend transactions; Monero [3, 35] uses ring
signatures to allow users to create “mix-ins” (i.e., include
the keys of other users in their own transactions as a way
of providing a larger anonymity set); and Zcash [7, 13]
uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow users to spend coins
without revealing which coins are being spent.
In terms of the latter, there has also been a signiﬁcant
volume of research on de-anonymizing Bitcoin [37, 38,
12, 27, 40]. Almost all of these attacks follow the same
pattern:
they ﬁrst apply so-called clustering heuristics
that associate multiple different addresses with one sin-
gle entity, based on some evidence of shared ownership.
The most common assumption is that all input addresses
in a transaction belong to the same entity, with some pa-
pers [12, 27] also incorporating an additional heuristic in
which output addresses receiving change are also linked.
Once these clusters are formed, a “re-identiﬁcation at-
tack” [27] then tags speciﬁc addresses and thus the clus-
ters in which they are contained. These techniques have
also been applied to alternative cryptocurrencies with
similar types of transactions, such as Ripple [30].
The work that is perhaps closest to our own focuses on
de-anonymizing the privacy solutions described above,
rather than just on Bitcoin. Here, several papers have
focused on analyzing so-called privacy overlays or mix-
ing services for Bitcoin [33, 26, 31, 32], and considered
both their level of anonymity and the extent to which
participants must trust each other. Some of this analy-
sis [32, 26] also has implications for anonymity in Dash,
due to its focus on CoinJoin. More recently, Miller et
al. [29] and Kumar et al. [23] looked at Monero. They
both found that it was possible to link together trans-
actions based on temporal patterns, and also based on
certain patterns of usage, such as users who choose to
do transactions with 0 mix-ins (in which case their ring
signature provides no anonymity, which in turns affects
other users who may have included their key in their
own mix-ins). Finally, we are aware of one effort to
de-anonymize Zcash, by Quesnelle [36]. This article fo-
cuses on linking together the transactions used to shield

In a t-to-

In a t-to-z transaction, a visible
amount of ZEC moves from a visible t-address into the shielded
pool, at which point it belongs to a hidden z-address (zOut
= /0). In a z-to-z transaction, a hidden quantity of ZEC moves
between hidden z-addresses (zIn,zOut = /0). Finally, in a z-

den z-address out of the shielded pool, at which point a visible
quantity of it belongs to a visible t-address (zIn = /0).

ments this heuristic but also provides a broader perspec-
tive on the entire Zcash ecosystem, as well as a more
in-depth analysis of all interactions with (and within) the
shielded pool.
3 Background
3.1 How Zcash works
Zcash (ZEC) is an alternative cryptocurrency developed
as a (code) fork of Bitcoin that aims to break the link be-
tween senders and recipients in a transaction. In Bitcoin,
recipients receive funds into addresses (referred to as the
vOut in a transaction), and when they spend them they do
so from these addresses (referred to as the vIn in a trans-
action). The act of spending bitcoins thus creates a link
between the sender and recipient, and these links can be
followed as bitcoins continue to change hands. It is thus
possible to track any given bitcoin from its creation to its
current owner.
Any transaction which interacts with the so-called
shielded pool in Zcash does so through the inclusion of
a vJoinSplit, which speciﬁes where the coins are com-
ing from and where they are going. To receive funds,
users can provide either a transparent address (t-address)
or a shielded address (z-address). Coins that are held in
z-addresses are said to be in the shielded pool.
To specify where the funds are going, a vJoinSplit
contains (1) a list of output t-addresses with funds as-
signed to them (called zOut), (2) two shielded outputs,
and (3) an encrypted memo ﬁeld. The zOut can be
empty, in which case the transaction is either shielded (t-
to-z) or private (z-to-z), depending on the inputs. If the
zOut list contains a quantity of ZEC not assigned to any
address, then we still consider it to be empty (as this is
simply the allocation of the miner’s fee). Each shielded
output contains an unknown quantity of ZEC as well as a
hidden double-spending token. The shielded output can
be a dummy output (i.e., it contains zero ZEC) to hide
the fact that there is no shielded output. The encrypted
memo ﬁeld can be used to send private messages to the
recipients of the shielded outputs.
To specify where the funds are coming from, a vJoin-
Split also contains (1) a list of input t-addresses (called
zIn), (2) two double-spending tokens, and (3) a zero-
knowledge proof. The zIn can be empty, in which case
the transaction is either deshielded (z-to-t) if zOut is not
empty, or private (z-to-z) if it is. Each double-spending
token is either a unique token belonging to some pre-
vious shielded output, or a dummy value used to hide
the fact that there is no shielded input. The double-
spending token does not reveal to which shielded out-
put it belongs. The zero-knowledge proof guarantees
two things. First, it proves that the double-spending to-
ken genuinely belongs to some previous shielded output.
Second, it proves that the sum of (1) the values in the
addresses in zIn plus (2) the values represented by the
double-spending tokens is equal to the sum of (1) the val-
ues assigned to the addresses in zOut plus (2) the values
in the shielded outputs plus (3) the miner’s fee. A sum-
mary of the different types of transactions is in Figure 1.
3.2 Participants in the Zcash ecosystem
In this section we describe four types of participants who
interact in the Zcash network.
Founders took part in the initial creation and release of
Zcash, and will receive 20% of all newly generated coins
(currently 2.5 ZEC out of the 12.5 ZEC block reward).
The founder addresses are speciﬁed in the Zcash chain
parameters [8].
Miners take part in the maintenance of the ledger, and
in doing so receive newly generated coins (10 out of the
12.5 ZEC block reward), as well as any fees from the
transactions included in the blocks they mine. Many
miners choose not to mine on their own, but join a mining
pool; a list of mining pools can be found in Table 4. One
or many miners win each block, and the ﬁrst transaction
in the block is a coin generation (coingen) that assigns
newly generated coins to their address(es), as well as to
the address(es) of the founders.
Services are entities that accept ZEC as some form of
payment. These include exchanges like Bitﬁnex, which
allow users to trade ﬁat currencies and other cryptocur-
rencies for ZEC (and vice versa), and platforms like
ShapeShift [4], which allow users to trade within cryp-
tocurrencies and other digital assets without requiring
registration.
Finally, users are participants who hold and transact
in ZEC at a more individual level. In addition to regu-
