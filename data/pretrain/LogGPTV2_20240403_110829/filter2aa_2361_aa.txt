ORDER
This case concerns the hugely popular World of Warcraft computer game (“WoW”)
and a software program known as Glider that plays WoW for its owners while those owners
are away from their computer keyboards.  The Court previously held Plaintiff/
Counterdefendant MDY Industries, Inc. (“MDY”) – the owner and distributor of Glider –
liable to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Vivendi Games, Inc. (collectively, “Blizzard”) –
the owners and distributors of WoW – for tortious interference with contract, contributory

1The general facts in this background section are found by the Court on the basis of
evidence presented at trial and the parties’ pretrial stipulations.  See Dkt. ##88, 97.  The
Court will provide additional issue-specific findings later in this order.

copyright infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement.  Dkt. #82.  The Court granted
summary judgment to MDY on the portion of Blizzard’s claim based on 17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(a)(2) that applied to Blizzard’s game client software code.  The Court also granted
summary judgment in favor of MDY on Blizzard’s unfair competition claim.  Id.
Following this ruling, the parties entered into a stipulation that Blizzard would recover
$6,000,000 in damages from MDY on the tortious interference, contributory copyright
infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement claims if any of those claims is affirmed
on appeal.  Dkt. #95.  The parties agreed that the Court should hold a bench trial to decide
three matters: (1) the remaining claims under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(“DMCA”), (2) whether Third-Party Defendant Michael Donnelly is personally liable to
Blizzard for MDY’s tortious interference and copyright infringement, and (3) whether
Blizzard is entitled to a permanent injunction.  Dkt. ##92, 96.  Blizzard agreed to dismiss its
trademark infringement and unjust enrichment claims.  Dkt. #95. 
The bench trial was held on January 8 and 9, 2009.  Dkt. ##100-02.  This order will
set forth the Court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The Court concludes that
Plaintiff MDY is liable under the DMCA, that Donnelly is personally liable for MDY’s
tortious interference, copyright infringement, and DMCA violations, and that Blizzard is
entitled to a permanent injunction against the continued sale and distribution of Glider.  The
Court will require additional briefing on whether the permanent injunction should be stayed
pending appeal.

Background.1
WoW players control their “avatar” characters within a virtual universe, exploring the
landscape, fighting monsters, performing quests, building skills, and interacting with other
players and computer-generated characters.  As players succeed, they acquire in-game assets,
experience, and power.  Players can advance from level 1 to level 60 with the basic game,

and through levels 70 and 80 with expansion modules.  Blizzard is the creator and operator
of WoW and owns all copyrights related to the game.  WoW was released in November of
2004 and is now the largest and most successful multiplayer online game in the world.  WoW
currently has some 11,500,000 players and generates more than $1.5 billion annually.
The WoW software consists of two components:  the “game client” software and the
“game server” software.  The game server software is located on a Blizzard-owned server.
A user obtains the game client software by purchasing a copy at a retail store or downloading
a copy from the WoW website.  The user plays WoW by loading the game client software
on his personal computer’s hard drive and accessing the game server software through an
online account for which he pays a monthly fee to Blizzard. 
Glider is a computer program known as a “bot” – a word derived from “robot.”  Glider
plays WoW for its owner while the owner is away from his or her computer keyboard.
Glider enables the owner to advance more quickly within WoW than would otherwise be
possible.
Donnelly incorporated MDY in 2004 in connection with his computer contracting
business.  Donnelly created, and MDY owns, Glider.  MDY began selling Glider to WoW
users in June of 2005.  To date, it has sold more than 100,000 copies and generated revenues
between $3.5 and $4 million.
WoW is a carefully balanced competitive environment where players compete against
each other and the game to advance through the game’s various levels and acquire game
assets.  Glider upsets this balance by enabling some payers to advance more quickly,
diminishing the game experience for other players.  Glider also enables its users to acquire
an inordinate number of game assets – sometimes referred to as “mining” or “farming” the
game.  The acquisition of these assets upsets the game’s economy, diminishing the value of
assets acquired by regular game users.
II.
Blizzard’s Remaining DMCA Claims.
Blizzard alleges that MDY and Donnelly have violated the DMCA.  Specifically,
Blizzard claims that MDY and Donnelly traffic in technological products, services, devices,

or components designed to circumvent technological measures Blizzard has put in place to
control access to its copyrighted work and to protect its rights as the copyright owner of
WoW.  Blizzard brings claims under sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1) of the DMCA,
17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2), 1201(b)(1). 
Section 1201(a)(2) provides that “[n]o person shall manufacture, import, offer to the
public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component,
or part thereof” that “is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a
technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title[.]”
17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)(A).  Even if the product is not “primarily designed or produced” for
this purpose, this section of the DMCA may be violated if the product has only limited
commercially significant purposes other than to circumvent the technological measure, or if
the product is sold with the knowledge that it will be used in circumventing the technological
measure.  Id. § 1201(a)(2)(B)-(C).  “[T]o ‘circumvent a technological measure’ means to
descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass,
remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright
owner[.]”  Id. § 1201(a)(3)(A).  “[A] technological measure ‘effectively controls access to
a work’ if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of
information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain
access to the work.”  Id. § 1201(a)(3)(B).
Section 1201(b)(1) is similar to section 1201(a)(2), with one critical difference.
Section 1201(a)(2) applies to protective measures that control “access” to software.  Section
1201(b)(1) applies to “a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright
owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof[.]”  17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1)(A).  The
protection of copyright rights, not controlling access, is key.  The statute provides that “a
technological measure ‘effectively protects the rights of a copyright owner under this title’
if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits
the exercise of a right of a copyright owner under this title.”  17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(2)(B).

A.
DMCA-Specific Findings of Fact.
Blizzard owns the copyright for the WoW software code.  When a user launches a
copy of WoW from his hard drive to play the game, the user’s computer copies the WoW
game client software from the hard drive to the computer’s Random Access Memory
(“RAM”).  This copying continues while the game is being played.  Additional copyrighted
software is loaded from the computer’s hard drive into RAM as the player reaches points in
the game where additional content is needed.
The game client software includes both literal code and nonliteral elements.  The Sixth
Circuit has explained the difference: “[i]n the essential setting where the DMCA applies, the
copyright protection operates on two planes:  in the literal code governing the work and in
the visual or audio manifestation generated by the code’s execution.”  Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v.
Static Control Components, Inc., 387 F.3d 522, 548 (6th Cir. 2004).  Blizzard’s game client
software includes literal code, stored as WoW.exe, and nonliteral elements such as graphics,
sound effects, and character animations. 
Blizzard employs a technical measure known as Warden to detect and prevent the use
of bots by WoW players.  Warden includes two software components.  One component,
known as “scan.dll,” scans the user’s computer for unauthorized programs before the user
logs onto a Blizzard game server to play the game.  Scan.dll examines certain portions of the
user’s RAM and WoW game data files for the presence of defined code signatures.  If
identified code signatures match those associated with unauthorized programs such as Glider,
scan.dll prevents the user from logging on to a Blizzard server. 
The second component, referred to as the “resident” component of Warden, runs
periodically while the user plays WoW.  The resident component sends requests asking for
the user’s game client software to report the content of certain defined portions of WoW
memory to the Blizzard game server.  If the client reports information showing a “clean”
segment of memory, the resident component permits the user to continue playing the game.
If the client reports information showing the presence of defined patterns of code associated
with unauthorized programs, the resident component can block access to the Blizzard server.
