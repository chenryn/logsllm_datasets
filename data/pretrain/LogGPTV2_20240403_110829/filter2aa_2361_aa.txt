**Case No. CV-06-2555-PHX-DGC**

**ORDER**

This case involves the popular online computer game "World of Warcraft" (WoW) and a software program called Glider, which automates gameplay for its users while they are away from their computers. The Court previously found MDY Industries, LLC (MDY), the owner and distributor of Glider, liable to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Vivendi Games, Inc. (collectively, "Blizzard"), the owners and distributors of WoW, for tortious interference with contract, contributory copyright infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement. (Dkt. #82). The Court granted summary judgment in favor of MDY on the portion of Blizzard's claim based on 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2) that applied to Blizzard’s game client software code and on Blizzard’s unfair competition claim. (Id.)

Following this ruling, the parties stipulated that if any of the claims for tortious interference, contributory copyright infringement, or vicarious copyright infringement were affirmed on appeal, Blizzard would recover $6,000,000 in damages from MDY. (Dkt. #95). The parties agreed to a bench trial to resolve three issues: (1) the remaining claims under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), (2) whether Michael Donnelly is personally liable to Blizzard for MDY’s tortious interference and copyright infringement, and (3) whether Blizzard is entitled to a permanent injunction. (Dkt. ##92, 96). Blizzard also dismissed its trademark infringement and unjust enrichment claims. (Dkt. #95).

The bench trial was held on January 8 and 9, 2009. (Dkt. ##100-02). This order sets forth the Court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Court concludes that MDY is liable under the DMCA, that Donnelly is personally liable for MDY’s tortious interference, copyright infringement, and DMCA violations, and that Blizzard is entitled to a permanent injunction against the continued sale and distribution of Glider. The Court will require additional briefing on whether the permanent injunction should be stayed pending appeal.

**I. Background**

World of Warcraft (WoW) is a multiplayer online game where players control avatars within a virtual universe, engaging in activities such as exploring, fighting monsters, performing quests, and interacting with other players and computer-generated characters. As players succeed, they acquire in-game assets, experience, and power. Players can advance from level 1 to level 60 with the basic game and through levels 70 and 80 with expansion modules. Blizzard, the creator and operator of WoW, owns all related copyrights. Since its release in November 2004, WoW has become the largest and most successful multiplayer online game, with over 11.5 million players and generating more than $1.5 billion annually.

The WoW software consists of two components: the "game client" software and the "game server" software. The game server software is hosted on Blizzard-owned servers. Users obtain the game client software by purchasing a copy at a retail store or downloading it from the WoW website. To play, users load the game client software on their personal computer and access the game server through an online account, for which they pay a monthly fee to Blizzard.

Glider is a "bot" (derived from "robot") that plays WoW for its owner while the owner is away from the keyboard, allowing the owner to advance more quickly within the game. Donnelly, who incorporated MDY in 2004 for his computer contracting business, created and owns Glider. MDY began selling Glider to WoW users in June 2005 and has sold over 100,000 copies, generating between $3.5 and $4 million in revenue.

WoW is designed as a balanced competitive environment where players compete against each other and the game to advance through levels and acquire game assets. Glider disrupts this balance by enabling some players to advance more quickly, diminishing the game experience for others. It also allows users to acquire an excessive number of game assets, often referred to as "mining" or "farming," which upsets the game's economy and diminishes the value of assets acquired by regular players.

**II. Blizzard’s Remaining DMCA Claims**

Blizzard alleges that MDY and Donnelly have violated the DMCA by trafficking in technological products, services, devices, or components designed to circumvent technological measures that control access to and protect Blizzard’s copyrighted work. Specifically, Blizzard brings claims under sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1) of the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2), 1201(b)(1).

**A. DMCA-Specific Findings of Fact**

Blizzard owns the copyright for the WoW software code. When a user launches WoW from their hard drive, the computer copies the game client software from the hard drive to the Random Access Memory (RAM). This copying continues as the game is played, with additional copyrighted software loaded from the hard drive into RAM as needed.

The game client software includes both literal code and nonliteral elements, such as graphics, sound effects, and character animations. Blizzard employs a technical measure called Warden to detect and prevent the use of bots by WoW players. Warden has two components: "scan.dll" and the "resident" component.

- **Scan.dll**: This component scans the user’s computer for unauthorized programs before the user logs onto a Blizzard game server. It examines certain portions of the user’s RAM and WoW game data files for code signatures associated with unauthorized programs like Glider. If such signatures are detected, scan.dll prevents the user from logging on to a Blizzard server.
  
- **Resident Component**: This component runs periodically while the user plays WoW. It sends requests to the user’s game client software to report the content of specific portions of WoW memory to the Blizzard game server. If the client reports a "clean" segment of memory, the resident component allows the user to continue playing. If it detects defined patterns of code associated with unauthorized programs, the resident component can block access to the Blizzard server.

These findings form the basis for the Court’s analysis of Blizzard’s DMCA claims.
