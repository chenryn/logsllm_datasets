Assistant: This log chunk is from a system log and is related to the kernel, corecaptured, networkd, and com.apple.WebKit.WebContent software components. It begins with the kernel logging an ARPT frame ready with a frame count of 1024. Corecaptured then copies files from the source path to the destination path and adds a registry child to the channel dictionary. The kernel then logs an AQM agg results and corecaptured copies another file. Networkd then successfully changes the NAT64 ifstate from 0x4 to 0x8000000000000000. The kernel then logs a wake reason, AppleThunderboltGenericHAL completes an early wake, AirPort links up on awdl0, and networkd changes the NAT64 ifstate back to 0x4. Corecaptured then skips a file, com.apple.WebKit.WebContent logs a crabsFlumeHostUnavailable, and sandboxd denies network-outbound access.
