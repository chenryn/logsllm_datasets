  * VSCode Version: Version 1.0.0-alpha Commit `6ea1266`
  * OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Compile https://gist.github.com/edumunoz/6e2ca90d4b5d3dbfa5340576e79ac113 with `g++ -g -std=c++11 -pthread hello.cpp -o hello`
  2. Install the C++ debug adapter
  3. Set a breakpoint in line 17 from the gist
  4. Have the main thread expanded in the callstack viewlet
  5. Expand another thread and click on a frame for which no source is available
  6. The "Load More Stack Frames" button appears for the main thread
  7. The "Load More Stack Frames" button is clicked, the callstack for the main thread gets duplicated (two `main()` in the screenshot)
Step 3

I understand if the debug adapter implements the "Load More Frames" feature,
this will work. However the experience seems kind of weird if the debug
adapter doesn't implement the feature (like C++ debug adapter as of now).
