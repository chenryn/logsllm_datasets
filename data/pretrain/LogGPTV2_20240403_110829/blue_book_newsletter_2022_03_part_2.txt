    If you want the question to exit when it receives a `KeyboardInterrupt` event,
    use `unsafe_ask` instead of `ask`.
## [HTML](html.md)
* New: Sum up the W3 HTML tutorial.
## [CSS](css.md)
* New: Sum up the W3 CSS tutorial.
## [Javascript](javascript.md)
* New: Use ternary conditional operator.
    It's defined by a condition followed by a question mark `?`, then an
    expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon `:`, and
    finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.
    `condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`
    ```javascript
    function getFee(isMember) {
      return (isMember ? '$2.00' : '$10.00');
    }
    console.log(getFee(true));
    // expected output: "$2.00"
    console.log(getFee(false));
    // expected output: "$10.00"
    console.log(getFee(null));
    // expected output: "$10.00"
    ```
* New: [Filter the contents of an array.](javascript.md#filter-the-contents-of-an-array)
    The `filter()` method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test
    provided by a function.
    The `filter()` method does not execute the function for empty elements.
    The `filter()` method does not change the original array.
    For example:
    ```javascript
    const ages = [32, 33, 16, 40];
    const result = ages.filter(checkAdult);
    function checkAdult(age) {
      return age >= 18;
    }

## Infrastructure Solutions
### [Krew](aws_snippets.md)
* New: [Find if external IP belongs to you.](aws_snippets.md#find-if-external-ip-belongs-to-you)
    You can list the network interfaces that match the IP you're searching for
    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --filters Name=association.public-ip,Values="{{ your_ip_address}}"
    ```
* New: Introduce krew.
    [Krew](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew) is a tool that makes it easy to
    use kubectl plugins. Krew helps you discover plugins, install and manage them on
    your machine. It is similar to tools like apt, dnf or brew.
### [Ksniff](kubectl_commands.md)

    ```bash
    kubectl create configmap {{ configmap_name }} --from-file {{ path/to/file }}
    ```
* New: [Restart pods without taking the service down.](kubectl_commands.md#restart-pods-without-taking-the-service-down)

### [Debugging](aws_waf.md)
* New: How to extract information from AWS WAF.
    [AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) is a web application firewall that helps
    protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots that
    may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
    AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling
    you to create security rules that control bot traffic and block common attack
    patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. You can also customize
    rules that filter out specific traffic patterns.
    In the article there are many queries you can do on it's data and
    a workflow to understand your traffic.
* New: How to debug kubernetes network traffic.
    Sometimes you need to monitor the network traffic that goes between pods to
    solve an issue. There are different ways to see it:
    * [Using Mizu](mizu.md)
    * [Running tcpdump against a running container](kubernetes_debugging.md#running-tcpdump-against-a-running-container)
    * [Using ksniff](ksniff.md)
    * [Using ephemeral debug containers](kubernetes_debugging.md#using-ephemeral-debug-containers)
    Of all the solutions, the cleaner and easier is to use [Mizu](mizu.md).

# Operative Systems
## Linux
### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)
* New: [Install one package from Debian unstable.](linux_snippets.md#install-one-package-from-debian-unstable)
* New: [Monitor outgoing traffic.](linux_snippets.md#monitor-outgoing-traffic)
* Correction: [Clean snap data.](linux_snippets.md#clean-snap-data)
    If you're using `snap` you can clean space by:
    * Reduce the number of versions kept of a package with `snap set system
        refresh.retain=2`
    * Remove the old versions with `clean_snap.sh`
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        #Removes old revisions of snaps
        #CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
        set -eu
        LANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |
            while read snapname revision; do
                snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"
            done)
        ```
* Correction: [Clean journalctl data.](linux_snippets.md#clean-journalctl-data)
    * Check how much space it's using: `journalctl --disk-usage`
    * Rotate the logs: `journalctl --rotate`
    Then you have three ways to reduce the data:
    1. Clear journal log older than X days: `journalctl --vacuum-time=2d`
    1. Restrict logs to a certain size: `journalctl --vacuum-size=100M`
    1. Restrict number of log files: `journactl --vacuum-files=5`.
    The operations above will affect the logs you have right now, but it won't solve
    the problem in the future. To let `journalctl` know the space you want to use
    open the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and set the `SystemMaxUse` to the
    amount you want (for example `1000M` for a gigabyte). Once edited restart the
    service with `sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
* New: [Set up docker logs rotation.](linux_snippets.md#set-up-docker-logs-rotation)
    By default, the stdout and stderr of the container are written in a JSON file
    located in `/var/lib/docker/containers/[container-id]/[container-id]-json.log`. If
    you leave it unattended, it can take up a large amount of disk space.
    If this JSON log file takes up a significant amount of the disk, we can purge it
    using the next command.
    ```bash
    truncate -s 0 
    ```
    We could setup a cronjob to purge these JSON log files regularly. But for the
    long term, it would be better to setup log rotation. This can be done by adding
    the following values in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.
    ```json
    {
      "log-driver": "json-file",
      "log-opts": {
        "max-size": "10m",
        "max-file": "10"
      }
    }
    ```
* New: [Clean old kernels.](linux_snippets.md#clean-old-kernels)
    The full command is
    ```bash
    dpkg -l linux-* | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d"-"` | grep -e [0-9] | grep -E "(image|headers)" | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge
    ```
    To test what packages will it remove use:
    ```bash
    dpkg -l linux-* | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d"-"` | grep -e [0-9] | grep -E "(image|headers)" | xargs sudo apt-get --dry-run remove
    ```
    Remember that your running kernel can be obtained by `uname -r`.
* Correction: [Clean old kernels warning.](linux_snippets.md#clean-old-kernels)
    I don't recommend using this step, rely on `apt-get autoremove`, it's safer.
### [ffmpeg](ffmpeg.md)
* New: [Convert VOB to mkv.](ffmpeg.md#convert-vob-to-mkv)
    * Unify your VOBs
        ```bash
        cat *.VOB > output.vob
        ```
    * Identify the streams
        ```bash
        ffmpeg -analyzeduration 100M -probesize 100M -i output.vob
        ```
        Select the streams that you are interested in, imagine that is 1, 3, 4,
        5 and 6.
    * Encoding
        ```bash
        ffmpeg \
          -analyzeduration 100M -probesize 100M \
          -i output.vob \
          -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -map 0:4 -map 0:5 -map 0:6 \

    commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational
    institutions.
# Arts
## [Aerial Silk](aerial_silk.md)
* New: Introduce Aerial Silk, some warmups and some figures.
    [Aerial Silk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_silk) is a type of performance in which one or more artists perform aerial acrobatics while hanging from a fabric. The fabric may be hung as two pieces, or a single piece, folded to make a loop, classified as hammock silks. Performers climb the suspended fabric without the use of safety lines and rely only on their training and skill to ensure safety. They use the fabric to wrap, suspend, drop, swing, and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions. Aerial silks may be used to fly through the air, striking poses and figures while flying. Some performers use dried or spray rosin on their hands and feet to increase the friction and grip on the fabric.
## [Book Binding](book_binding.md)
* New: Introduce book binding.
    [Book binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookbinding) is the process of
    physically assembling a book of codex format from an ordered stack of paper
    sheets that are folded together into sections called signatures or sometimes
    left as a stack of individual sheets. Several signatures are then bound together
    along one edge with a thick needle and sturdy thread.
