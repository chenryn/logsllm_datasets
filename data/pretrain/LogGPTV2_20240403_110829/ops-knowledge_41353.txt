User: On a Linux server, how to set firewall rules to restrict access requests from specific IP address ranges?
Assistant: Firewall rules can be set using the iptables command. The following is an example that only allows IP addresses in the range 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.255 to access the SSH service. 1. Enter the following command to open the iptables configuration file: ``` sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/iptables ``` 2. Add the following rule to the configuration file: ``` -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m iprange --src-range 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.255 -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j DROP ``` Among them, -A means adding rules, and INPUT means input chain , -p specifies that the network protocol is TCP, -dport specifies that the service port number is 22 (SSH port), -m iprange limits the range of source IP addresses. The last line -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j DROP indicates that except for the IP addresses that meet the above rules, other IP addresses will be prohibited from accessing the SSH service. 3. Save and exit the configuration file. 4. Restart the iptables service to activate the new rule configuration: ``` sudo service iptables restart ``` Then, only users with IP addresses within the specified range can access the SSH service.
