Been using React (Native) for half a year now, really enjoying it! I'm no
expert but have run up against what seems like a weakness in the framework
that I'd like to bring up.
**The problem**
_Sending one-off events down the chain (parent-to-child) in a way that works
with the component lifecycle._
The issue arises from the fact that props are semi-persistent values, which
differs in nature from one-time events. So for example if a deep-link URL was
received you want to say 'respond to this once when you're ready', not 'store
this URL'. The mechanism of caching a one-time event value breaks down if the
same URL is then sent again, which is a valid event case.
Children have an easy and elegant way to communicate back to parents via
callbacks, but there doesn't seem to be a way to do this same basic thing the
other direction.
**Example cases**
  * A deep-link was received and an app wants to tell child pages to respond appropriately
  * A tab navigator wants to tell a child to scroll to top on secondary tap
  * A list view wants to trigger all of its list items to animate each time the page is shown
From everything I've read, the two normal ways to do this are 1) call a method
on a child directly using a ref, or 2) emit an event that children may listen
for. But those ignore the component lifecycle, so the child isn't ready to
receive a direct call or event yet.
These also feel clunky compared to the elegance of React's architecture. But
React is a one-way top-down model, so the idea of passing one-time events down
the component chain seems like it would fit nicely and be a real improvement.
**Best workarounds we've found**
  * Add a 'trigger' state variable in the parent that is a number, and wire this to children. Children use a lifecycle method to sniff for a change to their trigger prop, and then do a known action. We've done this a bunch now to handle some of the cases listed above.
  * (really tacky) Set and then clear a prop immediately after setting it. Yuck.
Is there is some React Way to solve this common need? If so, no one on our
team knows of one, and the few articles I've found on the web addressing
component communication only suggest dispatching events or calling methods
directly refs. Thanks for the open discussion!
