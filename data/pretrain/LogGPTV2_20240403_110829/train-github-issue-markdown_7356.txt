I am trying to get the `route` decorator to work with the `MethodView`.
    from flask import Blueprint
    from flask.views import MethodView
    api = Blueprint("api", __name__)
    @api.route("/users")
    class UserAPI(MethodView):
        def get(self):
            pass
        def post(self):
            pass
I am not sure if this is currently supported but it would be a good plus.
