ABSTRACT 
IoT  (Internet  of  Things)  diversifies  the  future  Internet,  and  has 
drawn  much  attention.  As  more  and  more  gadgets  (i.e.  Things) 
connected to the Internet, the huge amount of data exchanged has 
reached  an  unprecedented 
level.  As  sensitive  and  private 
information exchanged between things, privacy becomes a major 
concern. Among many important issues, scalability, transparency, 
and reliability are considered as new challenges that differentiate 
IoT from the conventional Internet.   In this paper, we enumerate 
the IoT communication scenarios and investigate the threats to the 
large-scale,  unreliable,  pervasive  computing  environment.  To 
cope  with  these  new  challenges,  the  conventional  security 
architecture will be revisited.  In particular, various authentication 
schemes  will  be  evaluated  to  ensure  the  confidentiality  and 
integrity of the exchanged data.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Internet of Thing (IoT) is a self-configuring and adaptive complex 
network  that  interconnects  uniquely  identifiable  “Things”  to  the 
Internet through the use of interoperable communication protocols. 
The  “Things”,  sometimes  referred  to  as  devices  or  objects 
interchangeably, 
potential 
programmability  capability.    Information  about  the  “Thing”  can 
be collected from anywhere, at anytime, by anything.  IoT attracts 
much  attention  as  the  economic  prosperity  generated  by  the 
technology [1]. One of the economic opportunities is based on the 
data that the “Things” on the Internet shared.  The shared data is 
processed into information  as  the  input  for  other  “Things”  or  as 
reports for human to read [2]. Given the data that has been shared 
over  a  network  medium,  namely  the  Internet,  it  is  important  to 
protect  the  shared  data  as  it  may  contain  sensitive  and  private 
information [3]. With the growth of the technology on Big Data,

authentication  methods 
the  threat  is  severer  since  the  attacker  may  obtain  private 
information  through  the  raw  data  leaked  by  the  compromised 
objects.  Thus,  privacy  preservation  becomes  a  critical  issue  to 
address. 
Privacy  preservation  has  been  a  critical  issue  for  information 
security.    Significant  amount  of  work  has  been  done  in  the 
research  area. 
  Authentication  methods  and  cryptographic 
mechanisms  were  used  to  protect  user  privacy.  A  well-designed 
authentication  method  ensures  authenticity  so  that  only  the 
authorized  personal  or  object  has  the  access  to  the  private 
information.    On  the  other  hand,  cryptographic  mechanisms 
ensure that  sensitive  and  private information  is  protected  during 
transmission,  storage  and  processing.  Due  to  the  heterogeneity, 
battery capacity, and resource constraints of the “Things” in IoT, 
not  all  the  “Things”  in  IoT  has  the  capability  to  engage  the 
available 
cryptographic 
mechanisms. For this reason, privacy preservation in IoT security 
needs  to  be  revisited.    The  recent  research  on  IoT  privacy 
preservation  is  either  at  high  level  or  based  on  physical  layer 
communication security [4][5]. In this paper, we will focus on IoT 
privacy  preservation  in  the  application  layer.  We  will  construct 
various  application  scenarios  to  identify  privacy  preservation 
challenges. This information can be useful for the development of 
IoT applications that falls into these scenarios. 
IEEE  IoT  Initiative recently  launched  new  standards  project  [6], 
which  will  define  an  architectural  framework  for  the  IoT, 
including descriptions of various IoT domains, definitions of IoT 
domain abstractions, and identification of commonalities between 
different IoT domains. Furthermore, IEEE IoT Initiative launched 
IoT  ecosystem  study  to  determine  the  connective  areas  and 
potential  gaps  in  the  concept  of  IoT  that  could  be  addressed 
through pre-standards and standards activities.  
The  main  concern  that  differentiates  IoT  from  the  conventional 
Internet is scalability. In IoT, billions of objects are connected to 
the  network.  The  conventional  naming  policy  may  not  be  able 
handle the devices on this massive scale. The naming policy may 
need  to  be  improved  or  redesigned  to  provide  unique  naming 
convention. In response to the evolution of naming, identification 
and  authentication  methods  also  need 
redesigned 
accordingly.  Transparency  and  reliability  are  two  other  key 
challenges 
identification  and 
the  design  of 
authentication methods even more difficult.  
Transparency  is  an  important  issue  for  IoT  security.  Most  users 
cannot  patiently  finish  complex  configuration  steps  to  activate 
their smart devices. All the configuration settings should be nearly 
transparent  to  the  users.  Authentication  operations  should  be 
designed  as  simple  as  possible.  Although  X.509  PKI  may  be 
powerful enough, it is not practical to assume that a naive user has 
that  make 
to  be 
1taken 
the ability to successfully obtain and import valid certificates to a 
large number of IoT devices. One of the reasonable assumptions, 
for example, can be that users can find a passcode printed on the 
label  of  the  device  or  the  home  gateway.  Then  the  naming, 
identification,  and  authentication  settings  can  be  automatically 
executed after the passcode is entered. To achieve this goal, new 
standards need to  be  established.  The desired  standards  may  not 
need  to  be  totally  novel.  It  can  be  a  combination  of  existent 
standards  in  related  domains,  such  as  UPnP,  DLNA,  and 
DNSSEC.   
Reliability is another important issue for the IoT ecosystem.  Due 
to  limited  resources  and  battery  capacity,  IoT  objects  and 
communication between them are error-prone.  The heterogeneity 
of  objects  makes 
the  ecosystem  more  complex.  The 
implementation  and  evaluation  of  the  devices  and  services 
become  more  difficult.  Additionally,  when  errors  occur, 
debugging  and  repairing  are  also  more  difficult  in  the  IoT 
ecosystem.  Therefore,  not  only  robustness,  but  also  easy 
debugging  and  one-step  resumption  should  be 
into 
consideration  during  the  development  of  identification  and 
authentication schemes. Moreover, under a reasonable assumption, 
automatic  self-monitoring  and  healing  mechanisms  are  also 
desirable for the reason that debugging and repairing are difficult 
for naive users.  
Security  threats  to  IoT  can  be  generally  divided  into  two 
categories.  In  the  first  category,  the  threats,  similar  to  the 
conventional  network  ecosystem,  are  against  confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability (CIA). However, due to the large scale 
and heterogeneity  of  the  objects, the  complexity  and  severity  of 
the security  threats  is  much  more  serious.  The  other  category  of 
treats arises  from  the  new  property  of  IoT  ecosystem.  With  IoT 
objects  everywhere  taking  sensitive  readings  from  heartbeats  to 
room temperature at home, it can be expected that the data in the 
IoT ecosystem is more personal and dynamic. Because the huge 
number of IoT devices gather massive sensitive information about 
users, the  data  readings  about its  owner  and  the  personal  spaces 
are treated as personal assets where a leakage may reveal owner's 
geological location, health status, and living habits. Attackers may 
extract desired information and disclose personal privacy. 
In  response  to  the  security  threats,  security  requirements  for 
privacy protection and preservation need to be defined properly in 
IoT.  For  the  first  aforementioned  category  of  threats,  security 
requirements  should  cover  the  additional  concerns  dealing  with 
the large scale and heterogeneity of objects. For example, object-
to-object  (O2O)  communication  is  inevitable  given  that  IoT 
objects  collaborate to achieve  goals  without human intervention. 
Therefore,  the  security  requirements  aiming  at  authentication 
models  for  IoT  users/objects  are  important.  For  the  second 
category of threats, the security requirements should cover a set of 
new protection models. The models should be able to handle the 
information gathering and leakage for the IoT objects, especially 
for  resource-constrained  devices,  which  only  provide  limited 
security  protection.  Without  the  protection  models,  private  data 
can be misused by rouge users/objects, malicious data can cause 
object to misbehave, or alternation of exchanged data to deceive 
users/objects by a rouge party. 
Software  and  system  vulnerabilities  of  an  IoT  device  are  also  a 
critical issue which can lead to backdoor problems. With software 
vulnerabilities,  attackers  exercise  malicious  intents,  and  plant  a 
backdoor in a vulnerable IoT device to control the device. Due to 
the  resource  constraints  and  battery  capacity  of  IoT  devices, 
security  mechanisms  such  as  intrusion  detection  systems  and 
scenarios, 
introduces  personal

antivirus which consume a fair amount of computation power are 
not  suitable.  With  primitive  protection  mechanism,  injecting 
backdoors  into  an  IoT  device  is  relatively  easy.  Both  static  and 
dynamic analysis techniques have been used to verify a program.  
Static analysis has the limitation to uncover the vulnerabilities in 
the  real  execution  environment,  while  dynamic  analysis  is 
inadaptable  to  IoT  for  the  lack  of  the  computing  power  and 
battery  capacity.    More  detail  discussion  about  IoT  software 
security can be found in articles [3].  In this paper, we will focus 
on  object  identity  management  and  authentication  in  the  IoT 
ecosystem. 
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  introduces  the 
challenges  to  object  identification  and  authentication  for  IoT

given in section 5. 
2.  Naming, Identification and Authentication 
Wearable gadgets and smart home/office appliances are the main 
themes of Consumer Electronic Show (CES) 2015 [7].  Wearable 
gadgets  take  measurement  and  report  it  to  mobile  APPs.  These 
collected  data  are  then  passed  on  to  smart  furniture  and/or 
appliance  in smart home/office  to  make adjustment  accordingly. 
This is a common IoT application demonstrated in CES 2015. The 
communication scenario  of  information  exchange  can  be  broken 
into  two  categories  according  to  the  distance  range,  that  is, 
domestic  and  foreign.  Typical  domestic  communication  is  done 
locally without access to the public network (a.k.a. the Internet). 
Foreign  communication,  on  the  other  hand,  relies  on  the  public 
network to distribute data to distant objects. 
Heterogeneity  of  objects  is  expected  in  IoT  where  objects  have
