User: on Ubuntu 8/9, 
i'm trying to write a daemon in python, that monitors a certain network condition and informs the user using a gtk.messagedialog.
I installed this script using rc-update.
The daemon starts at boot, but doesn't show the dialog even after I login. I assume because init.d starts my daemon at tty1 and no gnome is available.
Tried running the dialog through a subprocess, but it seems to inherit the same run environment.
Whats the best practice for this sort of thing.
Assistant: You may use notify-send (from libnotify-bin package) to send notifications to desktop users from your daemon.
