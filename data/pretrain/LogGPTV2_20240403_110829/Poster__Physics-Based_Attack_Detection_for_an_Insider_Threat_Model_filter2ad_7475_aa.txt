## Abstract
Ensuring the proper functioning of critical systems requires the design of secure Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While most studies focus on external adversaries, they often overlook insider threats with physical access to the system. This paper proposes an attack detection mechanism for insiders with physical access to a CPS. The method leverages the system's dynamics and detects attacks based on the laws of physics. By analyzing the mass flow equations, we create a feature vector based on process dynamics. The model is trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the rate of change in the system's state as input to detect abnormal behavior. Experiments on a real water treatment testbed validate the model and measure its efficiency under normal and attack scenarios. The results show that the proposed scheme can detect attacks with up to 96% accuracy.

## 1. Introduction
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate computing resources with the physical world, creating interdependent systems that affect each other. These systems range from medical devices to critical infrastructures, including water, transport, and power systems. Securing these infrastructures is crucial to ensure safe operations. A successful attack could disrupt services and lead to catastrophic consequences, such as loss of life, economic, and environmental damage.

While CPS have been extensively researched for safety, the concept of secure CPS is relatively new. Most research focuses on "Cyber Attack and Attacker Models (CAAM)," which involve attacking a cyber system through its communication architecture or computing base. However, "CPS Attack and Attacker Models (CpsAAM)" consider both cyber and physical threats. In CpsAAM, attacks can be launched from the physical domain, achieving malicious objectives. Therefore, it is essential to develop attack and attacker models specific to CPS.

In this paper, we propose a physics-based attack detection method to secure control systems vulnerable to insider and physical attacks. Insider attacks have been reported in both legacy IT systems and CPS. A malicious insider has physical access to the plant and can tamper with sensors and actuators. Unlike traditional IT systems, CPS also require securing the physical space. Adversaries can launch attacks from the physical domain, which is not well-studied in earlier cybersecurity research. Physical security issues are highlighted as a unique challenge for CPS and are extensively modeled as a threat in CPS security literature.

We propose an attack detection method that exploits the physical characteristics of the process to detect abnormal behavior in a CPS. The method is based on the laws of physics and uses the mass flow equation to determine if the system is operating normally or under attack. We collected data from a real water treatment plant and extracted features from the rate of change of the system's state in different processes. A machine learning algorithm trains the classifier on the dataset obtained during normal operation. Fresh sensor data is then tested using the trained model. The model description and results are presented in Section 2, followed by our conclusions in Section 4.

## 2. System Description and Attack Detection

### 2.1 Attacker and Attack Model
This study was conducted on the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, which consists of six stages to purify water, managed by sensors, actuators, and a SCADA workstation.

**Assumptions on Attackers' Abilities and Capabilities:**
- The attacker has physical access to the SWaT plant and can tamper with physical devices.
- The attacker intends to affect the production of the water plant.

**Attack Scenarios:**
1. **Pumping + Physical Valve Opening (Drainage):** The attacker, assumed to be a disgruntled employee, opens the mechanical drainage valve, causing the water level to decrease rapidly. This attack remains undetected by network-based methods if the attacker closes the valve after sufficient drainage.
2. **Simple Physical Attack + Sensor Spoofing (Drainage):** The attacker opens the drainage valve and spoofs the sensor reading to deceive manual detection. This attack can cause physical damage to the plant and achieve the objectives of the first scenario.

### 2.2 Feature Selection and Evaluation
We consider attacks on level sensors and motorized valves. The detection mechanism is implemented on the level sensor in a water tank. The goal is to capture the physical coupling caused by monitoring the process. Figure 1 illustrates the attack scenario, where Region A shows normal operation, Region B shows the water level reducing under attack, and Region C is after the attack is removed.

The proposed method effectively captures the system's dynamics and detects attacks with high accuracy, making it a robust solution for securing CPS against insider threats.
