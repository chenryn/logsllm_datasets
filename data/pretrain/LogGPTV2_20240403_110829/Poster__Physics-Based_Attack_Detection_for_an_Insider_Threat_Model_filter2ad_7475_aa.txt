ABSTRACT
To ensure the proper functioning of critical systems, it is impor-
tant to design secure Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Since CPS are
connected systems, most studies consider external adversaries as a
threat model, which might not be able to cater for an insider threat
with the physical access to the system. In this article, we proposed
an attack detection mechanism for an insider who has physical
access to a CPS. The proposed method exploits the dynamics of the
system and detects an attack based on the laws of Physics. Based
on the mass flow equations, we analyze the rate of change in the
plant’s process and create a feature vector based on the process
dynamics. The model has been trained by passing rate of change
in system’s state as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM), to
detect the abnormal behavior in the system. Based on the proposed
framework, experiments are performed on a real water treatment
testbed, to validate our model and to measure the efficiency of the
plant in normal and under attack scenarios. The detection result
shows that proposed scheme can detect attacks with accuracy as
high as 96%.

1 INTRODUCTION
Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are combination of computing re-
sources and physical world, which are inter-dependent and tends to
effect each other. These systems range from medical devices to crit-
ical infrastructures including water, transport and power systems.
Securing these critical infrastructures is important, to ensure safe
operations. Any successful attack would not only disrupt a service
but also result in catastrophic consequences including loss of life,
economical and environmental. Cyber physical systems have been

researched extensively in the past for ensuring safety but notion
of secure CPS is relatively new. "Cyber Attack and Attacker Mod-
els (CAAM)" are point of extensive research but "CPS attack and
attacker model (CpsAAM)" were paid little attention. CAAM in-
cludes, attacking a cyber system via its communication architecture
or computing base. While in CpsAAM, despite of cyber components
threat, attacks can also be launched from physical subspace which
can achieve desired malicious objectives. Therefore, there is a need
to look into attack and attacker models specific to cyber physical
systems. In this paper, we are looking at the physics based attack
detection, which helps in securing control system vulnerable to
insider and physical attack.
Insider attacks have been reported [1–4, 9], in legacy cyber/IT
systems as well as in CPS [5], and we will see few of the examples
in related work section as well. A malicious insider, is an attacker
with physical access to the plant and thus to its devices such as
sensors and actuators. An attacker can physically replace or tamper
the sensors or can change the state of actuators. An important
difference between Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and traditional
IT systems, is that, CPS have a physical space to secure besides
cyber domain. In this context, an adversary can also launch an attack
from the physical domain, such attacks are not studied in earlier
cyber security research. Cyber physical systems are spread over
vast geographical region, which makes physical attacks realistic.
Physical security issues are highlighted as a unique challenge for CPS
and extensively modeled as a threat, in CPS security literature [7, 13].
We proposed an attack detection method to detect the abnormal
behavior in a CPS exploiting and utilizing the physical character-
istics of the process. For a CPS, traditional IT threat model is not
applicable as it is because of the physical domain, whereas we can
use this new dimension in our favor as an attack detection mecha-
nism. The proposed scheme is based on the laws of Physics, and
determines whether the system is in normal operation or under
an attack, based on the mass flow equation of physical process.
We collected data from a real water treatment plant [11] and ex-
tracted features from the rate of change of system’s state in different
processes. A machine learning algorithm is used to train the clas-
sifier on the obtained dataset during the normal operation of the
plant. Fresh data from sensors is tested using the obtained model.
Model description and results for the proposed scheme are shown
in Section 2, and then we conclude our findings in Section 4.
2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND ATTACK
DETECTION
This study is performed on Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed [11].
The testbed comprises of six stages to purify the water, passed

physical devices operated and controlled by a SCADA workstation.
2.1 Attacker and Attack Model
Assumptions on attackers abilities and capabilities: It is assumed that
an attacker has physical access to the SWaT plant and is capable
enough to tamper with physical devices. Assumptions on attack-
ers motivation: It is assumed that an attacker has an intention to
affect the production of the water plant. Attacker intentions are
mentioned below along with two different attack scenarios:
1. Pumping + Physical Valve Opening (Drainage)
2. Simple Physical Attack + Sensor Spoofing (Drainage)
We start this section by clearly laying out assumptions about attack-
ers capabilities, motivation and intentions for an insider in general
and attack scenarios described here in particular. Our insider has
access to physical facility as well as to the control logic of the cyber
physical system. As a part of our experiment, a stealthy attack is
designed under the assumption of a disgruntled employee, who
wants to maximize the damage without being detected. Damage
could be in terms of reduction in production rate, production qual-
ity, system efficiency or cost of production. The objective of the
attack is to drain a water storage tank by opening the drainage
valve. The objective chosen here is with an intention to incur loss
in performance efficiency but without being detected.
Attack Scenario 1: Attacker is assumed to be a disgruntled em-
ployee. As shown in Fig. 1, red dot signifies the start of attack by
changing the valve state, opening the mechanical drainage valve is
a physical attack and will go undetected by network based attack
detection methods, if attacker would close the valve after sufficient
drainage. The amount of water/resource to be drained can be cho-
sen depending on the control logic of the system. In programmable
logic controller (PLC) there are specified safe zones of operation for
water level in a tank, in safe zone PLCs keep issuing pumping com-
mand to actuators. By staying in operating range of water level but
depleting the resources (after attack the water level decreases with
higher rate), an attacker is trying to increase the cost of production
or even reduce the efficiency, as low supply of raw water/resource
would result in low production rate and will also take more time to
meet the end user requirements, this attack could not be detected if
there are no physics based methods employed for attack detection.
Attack Scenario 2: However, the above mentioned attack could be
detected if an operator at the site is monitoring the states of the
system on a SCADA workstation. To deceive such a detection, an
attacker can curate an attack, exploiting both domains and launch-
ing a Cyber-Physical attack. In such an attack, an insider will open
the drainage valve and also will spoof the sensor reading to deceive
the manual detection. In this case of attack scenario as shown in
Fig. 2 an attacker can choose to do physical damage to the plant as
well besides achieving objectives mentioned in attack scenario 1.
2.2 Feature Selection and Evaluation
In this section, we consider attacks on level sensor and motorized
valves as explained in previous section. Then we implement a de-
tection mechanism on the level sensor in a water tank. The idea
is to get a model that captures not only each stage individually,
but also the physical coupling caused by monitoring the process.
Figure 1: Attack Scenario 1, Region A shows the normal op-
eration with water pumping out, Region B shows water level
reducing under attack, Region C is after attack is removed.
