Ok this is an odd one:
If you have a matplotlib figure with multiple subplots and try to plot a
regplot inside one of the the axes, regplot will update the axes limits of the
last axes of the subplot.
The cause for this is pretty simple. in this line the regplot function calls
`plt.plot` instead of `ax.plot`. Hence the currently active axes (meaning the
last subplot) is targeted by this line, automatically updating its limits.
