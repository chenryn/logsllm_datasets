This issue may seem unusual:
When you have a `matplotlib` figure with multiple subplots and attempt to plot a `regplot` within one of the axes, the `regplot` function updates the axis limits of the last subplot instead of the intended one.

The cause of this behavior is straightforward. The `regplot` function internally calls `plt.plot` rather than `ax.plot`. As a result, the currently active axes (which is the last subplot by default) are targeted, leading to an automatic update of its limits.
