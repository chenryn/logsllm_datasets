**ATT&CK ID:** S0070  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** HTTPBrowser

**Description:**
HTTPBrowser establishes persistence by modifying the Windows Registry. Specifically, it sets the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` key value for `wdm` to the path of its executable. Additionally, it uses the `HKEY_USERS\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` entry to create a registry key named `vpdn` with the value `"%ALLUSERPROFILE%\%APPDATA%\vpdn\VPDN_LU.exe"`. These modifications ensure that the malware is executed every time the system starts, thereby maintaining persistence on the infected machine.
