Hi, I am facing a problem when I want to read the value of an input that have
suggestions from datalist, the value that I get from the input is only what I
type with the keyboard not the selected value, i’ll give an example to explain
better, for the HTML bellow, if I type ‘on’ than I select the suggestion which
is ‘111’ when I try to read the value of the input
(document.getElementById(“num”).value) I get ‘on’ instead of ‘111’, any
suggestions to fix it??
