Abstract—As mobile begins to overtake the ﬁxed Internet
access, ad networks have aggressively sought methods to track
users on their mobile devices. While existing countermeasures
and regulation focus on thwarting cookies and various device
IDs, this paper submits a hypothesis that smartphone/tablet
accelerometers possess unique ﬁngerprints, which can be ex-
ploited for tracking users. We believe that the ﬁngerprints arise
from hardware imperfections during the sensor manufacturing
process, causing every sensor chip to respond differently to the
same motion stimulus. The differences in responses are subtle
enough that they do not affect most of the higher level func-
tions computed on them. Nonetheless, upon close inspection,
these ﬁngerprints emerge with consistency, and can even be
somewhat independent of the stimulus that generates them.
Measurements and classiﬁcation on 80 standalone accelerom-
eter chips, 25 Android phones, and 2 tablets, show precision
and recall upward of 96%, along with good robustness to real-
world conditions. Utilizing accelerometer ﬁngerprints, a crowd-
sourcing application running in the cloud could segregate
sensor data for each device, making it easy to track a user
over space and time. Such attacks are almost trivial to launch,
while simple solutions may not be adequate to counteract them.

in the
Google Play and App Store [6], [52], smartphones and
tablets have emerged as the most popular platforms to assist
our daily activities and to exchange information over the
Internet. Most apps are offered as free with ads, which
allows ad networks to collect data for tracking users and
their online habits. While such tracking can be lucrative for

advertising companies [47], it raises major privacy concerns
for users.
Cookies were one of the most widely used mechanisms
to track users. To address the privacy concern of tracking
users, a “cookie law” has been enforced in the US and
Europe [18], which requires apps to obtain user-permission
before uploading cookies or any other identiﬁers to the
cloud. Nevertheless, research [28] shows that stealing of
various IDs, such as the IMEI (device ID), IMSI (subscriber
ID), or ICC-ID (SIM card serial number), is still rampant
in apps. Some recent proposals [27], [69] have designed
solutions to thwart ID-theft. Nevertheless, we have to be
vigilant since the unavailability of cookies and various IDs
is likely to motivate advertisers to ﬁnd new ways of linking
users to their app usage habits or browsing histories, if
past experience is an indication. Commercial advertising
companies, such as BlueCava and Iovation, have already
started to identify devices and link users based on browser
conﬁguration, screen resolution [47], etc.
In this paper, we explore cookieless methods to identify
devices. Inspired by past work on device ﬁngerprinting [37],
[57], [64], where WiFi chipsets were shown to exhibit
unique clock skews and frequency offsets, we ask the
question: could sensors in today’s smartphones also have
unique ﬁngerprints? Hardware imperfections are likely to
arise during the manufacturing process of sensors, suggest-
ing the existence of ﬁngerprints. However, sensors, such as
accelerometers, are known for generating noisy readings.
Therefore, can sensors’ ﬁngerprints be consistently measured
for device identiﬁcation? In the pursuit of this question,
we gathered, over time, around 80 standalone accelerometer
chips used in popular smartphones, subjected each of them to
vibrations from a single vibration motor (common in today’s
phones), and analyzed the large volume of data received
from each of them. We found that while high level operations
on the accelerometer signals yielded similar results, e.g.,
all the chips were comparable in counting the number of

walking steps, an appropriately designed high dimensional
feature-vector exhibited strong diversity, a ﬁngerprint.
Our initial skepticism that this ﬁngerprint is an outcome
of non-identical vibrations was dispelled when a given
accelerometer repeatedly exhibited the same distinct pattern.
Moreover, we found that the ﬁngerprints persist even if the
vibrations are subjected in less controlled settings, e.g., when
the user is naturally holding an accelerometer-equipped
phone. Even different phone cases made of rubber or plastic
did not affect much, so long as the system was trained
on those casings. We have also conducted experiments
subjecting smartphones to rotational motion instead of vi-
bration, which too afﬁrmed accelerometer diversity. Finally,
our attempts to scrub off the ﬁngerprint (without affecting
the high level functions such as step-count) did not meet
immediate success. Inducing small amounts of noise in the
accelerometer signal still preserved the ﬁngerprint; adding
too much noise affected the activity and gesture recognition
applications. This paper reports our effort
to verify the
existence of accelerometer ﬁngerprints, and draws attention
to new kinds of threats that may arise as a consequence.
Figure 1 illustrates one possible threat. Consider a com-
mon scenario where multiple motion-sensing apps, such as
a road trafﬁc estimator, a calorie counter, a gesture-based
gaming app, etc., all implanted with third-party ads. While
the cookie law and some recent proposals [27], [69] may
thwart attackers from conveying cookies or various IDs, we
observe that sensor data is not subjected to scrutiny since it
is legitimately required by apps. Thus, if the sensor data can
be used to identify devices, the advertising companies can
easily bypass the cookie law, and track the users by sensor
ﬁngerprints. Put differently, an accelerometer ﬁngerprint can
serve as an electronic cookie, empowering an adversary
to consolidate data per user, and track them over space
2
and time. Alarmingly, such a cookie is hard to erase,
unless the accelerometer wears out to the degree that its
ﬁngerprint becomes inconsistent. We have not noticed any
evidence of this in the 9 months of experimentation with
107 accelerometers.
The notion that sensors can offer side-channel informa-
tion is not new. Past work has demonstrated how accelerome-
ters can leak information in smartphones – for instance, from
accelerometer data gathered during typing, authors in [15],
[16], [43] have shown that the typed characters, such as
PIN numbers, can be inferred. Even swiping motion patterns
can be estimated [10]. While disabling the accelerometer
during a sensitive operation (e.g., typing PINs) is a plausible
solution, the same does not apply in our case because even
a small slice of the sensor reading is adequate to extract
the ﬁngerprint. Another alternative could be to perform the
computations locally on the phone and only send the higher
level results to the cloud. However, some operations are
far too CPU-heavy to be performed on-phone, while others
require matching against large databases that are expensive
to download to the phone. Pre-processing the readings and
scrubbing off the ﬁngerprint is probably the appropriate
approach, however, as we ﬁnd later, this requires deeper in-
vestigation in the future. Scrubbing without an understanding
of the app is risky – an app that needs high ﬁdelity readings
could easily be affected upon over-scrubbing.
A natural question on sensor ﬁngerprints pertains to
scalability, i.e., is the ﬁngerprint unique against millions
of sensors? We admittedly have no proof of such large
scale, neither a theoretical basis to justify our claim. We
have only attempted to lease/gather as many devices as
possible, amounting to: (1) 80 stand-alone accelerometer
chips of three types (used in the latest smartphones and
tablets, including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Kindle Fire).
(2) 25 Android phones composed of a mix of Samsung
S3, Galaxy Nexus, and Nexus S. (3) 2 Samsung tablets.
Each of the standalone chips were plugged into the same
customized circuit board connected to an external vibration
motor to provide the motion stimulus. As a result,
the
recorded accelerometer readings are free of any potential
effects caused by the OS version and the middleware of
smartphones. The Android phones and tablets were used
as is; the stimulus induced by programming its on-board
vibration motor.
The sensor ﬁngerprint is designed as a vector of 36
features drawn from the time and frequency domain of
accelerometer signals. A Bagged Decision Tree [20] is used
for ensemble learning and classiﬁcation. Results show that
among these sensors, classiﬁcation precision and recall reach
upwards of 96%. Moreover, the ﬁngerprints proved to be
robust, visible even through natural hand-held positions,
and even for various casings, including one of soft rubber.
While more extensive evaluation is warranted to verify the
hypothesis (perhaps in an actual manufacturing pipeline), we
accelerometer chips can lead to different acceleration values,
they may not affect the rated performance of the target
applications. However, these discrepancies may be sufﬁcient
to discriminate between them.
B. Evidence of Fingerprints
To gain early evidence on the existence of ﬁngerprints,
we conducted an experiment using 6 stand-alone accelerom-
eter chips of 3 types: (i) MPU-6050; (ii) ADXL-345; and
(iii) MMA-8452q. MPU-6050 is a MEMS chip [5] used in
many mobile devices, including the Galaxy S III and Kindle
Fire. The ADXL-345 is a small, thin, ultra-low power 3-
axis accelerometer [1] with a high resolution of 13 bits and
scaling up to ± 16g (where g is acceleration due to gravity).
This is mainly used for tap/swipe sensing and activity recog-
nition. MMA-8452q is a 12 bit digital 3-axis low-power
capacitive accelerometer [4], available in QFN packaging,
and conﬁgurable to ±2g/±4g/±8g through high-pass ﬁlters.
The mix of chips included in the experiment are 2 MPU-
6050 from two different vendors (SparkFun and Amazon),
3 ADXL-345, and 1 MMA-8452q. We setup the Arduino
Uno R3 boards [2] to collect accelerometer readings from
the chips. We use an external vibration motor – the model
used in most smartphones – to stimulate the accelerometer
with a speciﬁc vibration duty-cycle, controlled through the
Arduino board. Fig. 3 shows the experimental setup.
Fig. 3: Experimental setup with the Arduino board on the
left, the red accelerometer chip on the breadboard, and the
vibration motor connected over the wire.
Each of the six stand-alone chips are stimulated with an
identical vibration sequence and their accelerometer readings
are recorded. Figure 4a shows the root sum square (RSS)
of the three axes values against time. The plots on each
column are distinct but the elements in the top two rows look
similar (i.e., tagged “A” and “B”, “C” and “D”). To separate
them out, Figure 4b plots the mean RSS values against their
standard deviations (i.e., in a 2-dimensional plane). Each
experiment on a chip yields a data point on the graph and the
points from multiple experiments on the same chip exhibits
a cluster. The top two rows that appear similar in Figure 4a
begin to separate out on this 2-dimensional plane, although

believe that our results are still valuable. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the earliest work that suggests and veriﬁes
(in a lab setting) that accelerometers in modern smartphones
are identiﬁable. We call the overall system, AccelPrint.
II. ACCELEROMETERS: A CLOSER LOOK
This section presents a brief background on accelerome-
ters to qualitatively reason about the source of ﬁngerprints.
Then, we describe our experiment framework and present
early evidence of accelerometer ﬁngerprints. Detailed results
and associated issues are presented in the evaluation section.
A. Hardware Imperfections
Accelerometers in smartphones are based on Micro
Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
that emulate the
mechanical parts through micro-machining technology [8].
Figure 2 shows the basic structure of an accelerometer chip,
composed of several pairs of ﬁxed electrodes and a movable
seismic mass. The distances d1 and d2 represent the small
gaps that vary due to acceleration and form a differential
capacitor pair. The chip measures the acceleration according
to the values of these differential capacitor pairs. It is the
lack of precision in this electro-mechanical structure that
introduces subtle idiosyncrasies in different accelerometer
chips. Even slight gaps between the structural parts (intro-
duced during the manufacturing process) can change the
capacitance [8]. Moreover accelerometer chips use Quad Flat
Non-leaded (QFN) or Land Grid Array (LGA) packaging,
another potential source of imperfections [22].
According to the ofﬁcial data sheets, the target applica-
tions for smartphone accelerometers are gesture recognition,
display rotation, motion-enabled games, ﬁtness monitoring,
etc. These applications primarily depend on the relative
change in the accelerometer readings as opposed to their
absolute values. Therefore, while subtle imperfections in the

some overlap still remains. Of course, other features might
be more effective in reducing the overlap.
To further distinguish the 6 chips from each other, we
considered a feature called skewness, which measures the
asymmetry of a probability distribution. Figure 4c shows the
skewness of the accelerometer readings of the two similar
MPU-6050 chips (tagged “C” and “D”). Evidently, one
consistently shows a higher skewness over the other even
though they are the of same make and model. This suggests
that chips that appear indistinguishable on one dimension
may be well separated on others. However,
these three
features, RSS mean, std. deviation, and skewness, alone are
not sufﬁcient to discriminate all accelerometers. Therefore,
recruiting an appropriate set of feature vectors and projecting
the accelerometer signals on them may demonstrate that
accelerometers could indeed be unique.
An accelerometer ﬁngerprint (under controlled vibration
sequences) may not necessarily translate to a smartphone
ﬁngerprint in the real world. First, the OS running on the
phone, application API, and CPU load, can all inﬂuence the
sensor readings. Second, considering that ﬁngerprinting is
based on subtle features in response to brief vibrations, the
surface on which the device is placed, or its casing, may
also matter. While these make ﬁngerprinting a naturally-
used smartphone more challenging compared to a standalone
accelerometer, we observe that additional sensors on the
phone could be harnessed as well. A gyroscope, barometer,
and accelerometer may together exhibit a ﬁngerprint robust
to OS versions, CPU-load, and surfaces. While we leave
this exploration to future work, in this paper we show that
accelerometers alone can achieve reasonable smartphone
ﬁngerprinting under uncontrolled conditions. Naturally, this
makes the threats imminent.

protected by monitoring strategies [27], [28]. Thus,
the
adversary tries to obtain the ﬁngerprint of the built-in sensors
(e.g., accelerometers). We assume that the adversary is able
to interact with apps on the smartphone, has access to
