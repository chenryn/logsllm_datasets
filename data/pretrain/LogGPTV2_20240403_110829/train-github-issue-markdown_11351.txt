Current switching order is as tab display order, which is useless when opening
many tabs.  
Other editors uses MRU order to improve it (Intellij IDEA, Sublimetext,
VS.net, Windows alt-tab etc..)
It's better to popup an open file list (in MRU order) when do switching (like
IntelliJ IDEA / Windows alt-tab does).
