The current method of switching between tabs follows the order in which they are displayed, which can be inefficient when managing a large number of tabs. 

Other editors, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Sublime Text, Visual Studio, and even the Windows Alt-Tab feature, use a Most Recently Used (MRU) order to enhance tab navigation. This approach significantly improves the user experience by prioritizing recently accessed files.

To improve the current system, it would be more effective to implement a pop-up list of open files, ordered by their most recent usage, when switching between tabs. This is similar to the functionality provided by IntelliJ IDEA and the Windows Alt-Tab feature.
