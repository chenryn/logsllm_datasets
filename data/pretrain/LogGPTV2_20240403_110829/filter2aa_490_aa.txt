Warning!!!
● Some of the techniques discussed in this
presentation can be hazardous to your personal
freedoms.
– Mainly the staying out of jail part
● Everything discussed in this presentation is
strictly theoretical ;)

Why?
● Why do we want to create unreliable systems?
Isn't that the opposite of what we are supposed
to do?
● Don't people get paid to make systems reliable?
● Unreliable systems can not be counted on.

Technology Changes Everything
● We do not have new problems, we have new
technology.
● We seem to love having our freedoms taken
away, just because things are cool or
convenient.
● Companies and the Government are finding
newer more sneaky ways to get your
information.

A Presumptive Right To Privacy?
Why not presume the right/need for privacy?
The number one excuse:
“I've got nothing to hide!”
This is the comfortable position of those who are
not marginalized.

Are you:
In great pain and unable to legally manage pain?
Gay and in the military?
Needing to express unpopular views that would
otherwise risk your safety?
A whistle blower?
A security researcher?

anything wrong!”

Dilemma
The things that make the web useful
are often potentially invasive
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Proposed Architecture for Web
Search Privacy
1. Existing: Tor + TorButton
Summary: Hide your IP Address
The Hacker Pimps

Proposed Architecture for Web
Search Privacy
2. Proposed “Quiet” button
● Turn off automatic search completion
(automatic with Tor)
● Block access to cookies: use/keep
cookies, but make them inaccesable on
demand.
●Alternatively, the imilly.com google cookie
anonymizer (but what about other search
engines)

Proposed Architecture for Web
Search Privacy
3. Proposed Plugin:
P2P Web Search Identity Diffusion
On demand, hide in a crowd
A Nifty, Helpful, Insufficient Idea
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
P2P Identity Diffusion
When you do a web search,
a. N ?= 30 instances of the query terms are put on P2P
b. the plugin downloads N queries from P2P
c. a and b are executed through Tor,hiding your IP address.
d. The N searches are executed in the background
e. the original search is executed after
(rand() % N)
P2P queries are executed
f. User-Agent is modified to indicate P2P Search
Summary: The origin of an individual query will still diffuse
among N browsers

Why Insufficient?
Aggregates and Standing out from the crowd.

WTF?

The Point
1. Wake Up! It's not like they say on the news
2. (The “real” point): Diffusing a query source is
insufficient until N is sufficiently large to smooth
your graph down into the aggregate picture

A Change of Focus
● We spend a lot of time worrying about people
knowing who we are or where we connect from.
● There is a larger problem of people knowing
what we are.
– This is the ultimate goal of collection technologies.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Who You Are
● Who you are is your identity and all of the
associated items that identify you:
– Name
– Address
– SSN
– Phone Number
– Etc.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
What You Are
● Male / Female.
● Race, Non-Religious / Religious, Straight / Gay.
● Diabetic, Asmatic, other medical conditions.
● Mental issues.
● Veteran.
● Porn addict.
● Compulsive masturbator.
The Hacker Pimps

Who and What
● Put both the Who and the What together and it
starts to get real scary.

Collected Data
● Collected data is dangerous.
– It can be sold.
– It can be misused. (Government creating files on all
of us).
– Incorrect assumptions can be made on this
collected data.
– May be impossible to correct inaccuracies.
● Data is collected from:
– Aggregates
– Inference
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Aggregated Data
● Data collected from multiple sources in order in
to obtain a more complete picture.
● Example: Collecting data from multiple sources
to get an idea of your shopping habits:
– Credit Card
– Grocery Rewards
– Mailing Lists from Businesses
– Etc.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Inferred Data
● An inference made from collected data.
● Less accurate than aggregated data.
● Often inferences can be wrong, such as:
– Example: You buy multiple packs of Sudafed, so
you must be cooking Meth.
– Example: You drive through bad parts of town, so
you must be buying drugs.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
A Step Further
● What if a profile of you was created from this
collected data both aggregated and inferred.
● Think back to the previous slide about “what
you are”, a couple theoretical situations:
– Statistics could show that since you watch certain
shows, download porn, and have diabetes that you
are 30% more likely to kill someone.
– 40% more likely to be guilty of domestic violence.
● Do you really want data like this in the hands of
people that can't protect it anyway?

Eating Your Own Cake
● You can't freely share information, and expect
to keep it private.
– Social networks, blogs, etc.
– Public Resumes and CVs.
● Even using an alias can be dangerous.
● Decide what you want people to know about
you, and make it public.

So How Does It Work?
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Recognition Technologies
● Traditional Biometrics
● Also, linguistics and web habits.
– MS is working on technology to identify you through
your web habits.
● If this technology is widespread it could be next
to impossible to correct inaccuracies.

It's Only Going To Get Worse
● Your information is big business $$$
– Not just your personal information but psudo-profile
information as well.
● Computers need to learn to forget.
– Viktor Mayer-Schönberger
– Useful Void: The Art of Forgetting in the Age of
Ubiquitous Computing
● Not to mention all of this affects our freedom of
speech.

Future Connected Technologies
● Just think if your home could talk, all of the
things it could say about you. In the future, it will
talk and probably not to who you want it to.
● Future connected homes are going to become
a hotbed for embedded spyware. It is inevitable.
– Connected Devices and appliances = Collected
Information
● We did an entire presentation on this at Hope
Number Six last year.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Future Connected Technologies
● We freely give away our rights when we agree
to the user agreement.
● We allow companies to spy on us.
● Unless we refuse to use their items, this trend
will not change.
● We need to start looking at new technology as
researchers and not as simple users if we care
about our information.

System Models
● My Co-workers Philosophy about computers
– Way too simple, but we can start there anyway
– The basics of a system
● Input – Processing – Output

Slightly Expanded Model
● Let's add a couple of components
– Method
– Storage
