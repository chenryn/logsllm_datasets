# Property Comparison with Other Research Proposals

| Proposal | O(N) States | Cryptography | Puzzle |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Yes      | No          | Yes          | Unrelated |
| Related  | None        | Per-AS       | Redesign  |
| None     | Victim-chosen| None         | Per-compute |
| New header | IPv6 upgrade | the Internet | - |

**Table 4.** Property comparison with other research proposals. "O(N) states" means that the number of states maintained by a router increases with the number of attackers. "Cryptography" means that a router needs to support cryptographic operations, e.g., MAC computation. "Puzzle" means that the mechanism requires computational puzzle distribution.

## The NaturalShare Policy

| Dp (s) | Thdrop | slr | Flat | Shrew |
|--------|--------|-----|------|-------|
| 2      | 1.1    | 0.17| 0.65 | 0.03  |
| 8      | 0.78   | 0.77| 0.1  | 0.39  |
| β      | 1.0    | 0.5 | 1.1  | 1.2   |
|        | 0.9    | 0.78| 0.80 | -     |

## The PerSenderFairshare Policy

| Dp (s) | Thdrop | slr | Flat | Shrew | Reactive |
|--------|--------|-----|------|-------|----------|
| 2      | 1.0    | 1.1 | 1.0  | 1.1   | 0.98     |

**Table 5.** Clients' average window size under different parameter settings.

### Simulation Results
Under the NaturalShare policy, a shorter Dp (period) results in a larger window size for legitimate clients because each sender's Window Rate (WR) is updated per period, leading to faster reduction in attackers' window sizes. A smaller Thdrop value slows down the clients' recovery, while a larger value allows larger window sizes for attackers, both of which reduce the clients' share. A larger β has negative effects as it takes more time for the clients to recover to a low Loss-to-Loss Ratio (LLR).

With the PerSenderFairshare policy, MiddlePolice’s performance is more consistent under different parameter settings. The most sensitive parameter is Thdrop, as it determines whether a source can send best-effort traffic.

## Related Work

In this section, we briefly discuss previous academic work. Previous research approaches can be generally categorized into:

- **Capability-based approaches**: SIFF [50], TVA [51], NetFence [35]
- **Filtering-based approaches**: Traceback [44, 46], AITF [12], Pushback [26, 37], StopIt [34]
- **Overlay-based approaches**: Phalanx [18], SOS [28], Mayday [7]
- **Deployment-friendly approaches**: Mirage [38], CRAFT [29]
- **Approaches based on new Internet architectures**: SCION [52], SIBRA [13], XIA [40], AIP [8]
- **Others**: SpeakUp [49], SDN-based [19, 45], CDN-based [22]

We summarize the properties of one or two approaches from each category in Table 4. The comparison shows that MiddlePolice requires the least deployment (no source upgrades, no additional router support, and no deployment from unrelated ASes) while providing the strongest property (enforcing destination-chosen policies).

## Discussion

### mboxes Mapping
MiddlePolice can leverage end-user mapping [15] to achieve better mbox assignment, such as redirecting clients to the nearest mbox, mapping clients according to their ASes, and load balancing.

### Incorporating Endhost Defense
MiddlePolice can cooperate with the DDoS defense mechanisms deployed on the victim. For instance, via botnet identification [27, 36], the victim can instruct the mboxes to block botnet traffic early at upstream, saving more downstream bandwidth for clients. This is possible because the policies enforced by MiddlePolice are completely destination-driven.

### Additional Monetary Cost
As discussed in Section 8.2.1, MiddlePolice introduces small computational overhead. Compared with basic DDoS-as-a-service solutions, MiddlePolice offers additional functionalities such as enabling destination-chosen policies and filtering bypassing traffic. In a competitive marketplace, the service’s price (monetary cost) should scale with the cost of providing that service, which, in the case of MiddlePolice, is low.

## Conclusion

This paper presents MiddlePolice, a DDoS defense system that is as deployable as cloud-based systems and has the same destination-based control as capability-based systems. In its design, MiddlePolice explicitly addresses three challenges:

1. **Limited Deployment**: MiddlePolice designs a capability mechanism that requires only limited deployment from the cloud, rather than widespread Internet upgrades.
2. **Destination-Driven**: MiddlePolice is fully destination-driven, addressing the shortcomings of existing capability-based systems that can work only with a single fairness regime.
3. **Traffic-Bypass Vulnerability**: MiddlePolice addresses the traffic-bypass vulnerability of existing cloud-based solutions.

Extensive evaluations on the Internet, testbed, and large-scale simulations validate MiddlePolice’s deployability and effectiveness in enforcing destination-chosen policies.
