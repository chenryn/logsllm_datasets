User: I have a  shell script that I want to run automatically every day at 08 AM, and I am not authorised to use the crontab because I don't have root permission 
My home directory is /home/user1/.
Any suggestions?
Assistant: I don't think root permission is required to create a cron job. Editing a cronjob that's not owned by you - there's where you'd need root.
