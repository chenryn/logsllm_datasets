User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to get the last Windows domain logon times for all domainusers in Samba? We run samba as primary domain controller using ldap for the user account settings. As the title says, I am looking for an easy way to get the last logon times for each of those domain users.

I could generate a script to lookup all usernames from either pam or ldap and grep the samba log files, which might be error prone. I guess there is already an intended way of doing that.

So, how to get the last logon time for each user on any/all Windows machine(s)?

Assistant: I haven't used samba + LDAP for a while, but I remember there being sambaLogonTime and sambaLogoffTime attributes in the schema. 

The samba-ldap howto mentions these attributes

However, I'm not sure if these are populated automatically. This link suggests that they aren't, although that's quite old now. I didn't need to use these attributes, so I didn't really pay any attention to them
