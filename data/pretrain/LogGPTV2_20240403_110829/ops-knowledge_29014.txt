User: What is the index pattern in Kibana? How to create and manage it?
Assistant: An Index pattern is a way of defining a dataset that tells Kibana how it should interpret the indexes in an Elasticsearch cluster. Usually, the index name will contain timestamp information, such as logstash-2017.01.01, and an index pattern can manage multiple such named indexes. The method to create an index pattern is as follows: 1. On the Kibana main page, click the "Management" option in the left navigation bar; 2. On the management page, click the "Kibana" option in the lower left corner, and then select "Index Patterns"; 3. Click the "Create index pattern" button, and then enter the wildcard expression of the index name (such as "logstash-*"); 4. Follow the prompts to configure the settings of the index pattern, such as the name and format of the time field, etc.; 5. Click " Create index pattern" button to complete the creation. When managing the index pattern, you can perform the following operations: 1. Edit: modify the configuration information of the index pattern; 2. Delete: delete the index pattern without deleting the actual index; 3. Close/Open: temporarily close or re-enable index pattern; 4. Set default: set index pattern as the default search index; 5. Index field mapping: view the type and other attributes of each index field. In short, the index pattern is the core of Kibana's use of Elasticsearch data, and its creation and management are very important for Kibana's data analysis and search.
