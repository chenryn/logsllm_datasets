Two blurred images are shown on the left side of Figure 6
and 10. The PSF was extracted from the images as shown in
the respective middle images. The result after deconvolution
(200 iterations, running times of approximately 1 minute on
an ordinary desktop machine) is shown in the respective
right images. We also tested the Wiener ﬁlter, which runs
faster but yields slightly worse results.
We identiﬁed additional
improvements and variations.
First, one could use other sources of light to measure the
PSF. For example, Status LEDs of the monitor or of any
other devices might be usable. Colored LEDs constitute
particularly promising candidates because their typically
narrow spectrum is well-suited for a matching ﬁlter to
yield a good contrast. Even stationary light sources such
as lights at a nearby parking lot might be suitable. Second,
accurately focusing on moving objects is still a challenge.
A conveniently usable, precise auto-focuser, a feature that
is available in almost any modern camera, would be a
great help. However, designing an auto-focuser that can
handle a very narrow depth-of-ﬁeld and moving objects, and
has the accuracy that is needed for successfully recovering
information from captured reﬂections is a non-trivial task.
Finally, a larger image sensor – or a sensor with higher
resolution – would facilitate the task of aiming at the user’s
eye.
3. Diffuse Reﬂections
In the previous sections we have shown that specular
and glossy surfaces like an eye reﬂect a clear picture of
the information on a near-by screen. In this section we
investigate another type of attack: we investigate to what
extent one can spy on reﬂections on diffuse surfaces.
A diffuse surface will be lit up homogeneously according
to the total emitted light of the screen as the reﬂection
i.e.
of each surface point
integrates over all directions,
over all pixels on the screen. In this typical setup,
the
spatial variation on a diffuse surfaces caused by a near-
by screen will therefore be too smooth to be informative.
However, a clear picture will be formed if a sharp, spatially

varying pattern is projected onto the diffuse surface, e.g.,
the standard case of a video projector.
Using a privacy ﬁlter on a monitor will limit the range of
directions into which a monitor emits light, so an observer
looking at the screen from a shallow angle might observe a
dark screen. Depending on the width of the emitted cone,
the screen with the privacy ﬁlter will act as an unfocused
projector and shape a spatially varying pattern on a near-by
diffuse surface, forming a blurred image.
In Section 3.2 we will show that by applying deconvo-
lution, a coarse structure of the displayed image becomes
visible. However, the resolution is limited as the emitted
cones are typically still too wide to reconstruct a sharp
image, due to largely overlapping ﬁlter kernels per pixel. In
Section 3.3 we show how to effectively limit the obtainable
resolution for a certain setting.
3.1. Advanced Image Deconvolution
The PSFs we have to deal with when spying on reﬂections
in diffuse surfaces are much larger, thus better deconvolution
algorithm are required. In this section we describe a recently
proposed variant of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution that
is more robust, called robust and regularized Richardson-
Lucy deconvolution (RRRL). While RRRL achieves a higher
reconstruction quality than standard RL, its computational
cost is signiﬁcantly higher. We therefore reserve its use to
those cases where standard RL gives no reasonable results,
which is particularly true in the case of diffuse reﬂections.
To improve the reconstruction of image structures in RL,
an additional regularization was introduced by Dey et al.
[8]. It is derived from total variation (TV) regularization
[20], which plays an important role in contemporary image
processing. In contrast to the regularization by iteration
count, the regularization at different image locations adapts
to image structures,
thereby more accurately preserving
structure (like edges) in the deconvolution process.
Another strategy that has proven successful in improving
image processing algorithms is robustiﬁcation, see e.g. [36]
for an application in deconvolution. In methods that correct
errors in an iterative fashion, robustiﬁcation is done by ap-
plying a weighting function with values smaller than one that
gives large errors a reduced weight in the correction step. In
this way, the process gains robustness against outliers, and is
better capable of handling strong noise. Even imprecisions in
PSF estimation can be handled, and also moderate violations
of model assumptions such as spatially invariance of blur, or
the loss of information by blurring across image boundaries.

scaled and ﬂipped the image horizontally, so the letters
appear in the correct orientation.
3.3. Limitations
Here, we give a theoretical bound on the applicability of
this type of attacks, and we show that our results are almost
optimal.
The light transport from a monitor image L to the image
E formed on the diffuse reﬂector (both seen as vectors) can
be expressed as the light transport matrix M :
E = M L.
(4)
To compute M we have simulated the light transport. If no
privacy ﬁlter is used, we roughly estimated the distribution to
follow the function cos4 θ, where θ is the angle between the
viewing direction and the monitor normal. With the privacy
ﬁlter in place the emitted light is much more directed, i.e.
concentrated around the normal, resulting in a distribution
following cos93.4θ.
In order to reconstruct the monitor image L from the
captured reﬂection E, i.e., to perform the deconvolution, the

transport matrix M needs to be inverted: L = M
Figure 13 we plotted the condition number, i.e. the ratio
of the maximal to minimal singular value of M (κ(M) =
(cid:4)M−1(cid:4)
(cid:4)M(cid:4) ), that is correlated to the stability of the inversion
process, for different pixel conﬁguration and distances of the
two planes. The graph is read as follows: At a distance of
25 cm one would be able still resolve a 3×3 pixel pattern on
a patch of size 10 cm× 10 cm, while the condition number
for a resolution of 4 × 4 is borderline, and resolving 5 × 5

which we will call robust and regularized Richardson-

decreasing nonnegative functions on the nonnegative real
numbers. In our experiments, we use ϕ(z) := (z2 + ε)−0.1
and ψ(z) := (z2 + ε)−0.5 with a small positive ε. The
asymmetric penalizer function rf (w) = w − f − f ln(w/f)
is used to measure the reconstruction error in step k, i.e., the
deviation of uk∗ h from f . The weight parameter α controls
the inﬂuence of TV regularization. More details on RRRL
can be found in the preprint [32] by one of the authors.
3.2. Results
Figure 11 shows the results of deconvolution of a diffuse
reﬂection. The setup was as follows. We placed the monitor
(with the privacy ﬁlter) against a white wall, at a distance of
25 cm (this is the depth of the keyboard, thus it essentially
provides a lower bound) and captured the diffuse reﬂection
with a digital camera. The monitor showed a single white
letter on black background, with an unrealistically large
size of 10 cm. (The camera used was a Canon EOS 400d,
exposure time was 10 sec at F 5.6 and ISO 100. Captured
as RAW, and exported with linear scaling of the intensity
values.) It turned out that the black pixels of the monitor
still
leak a substantial amount of light. This leakage is
directed differently than the white pixels, so it disturbs the
deconvolution algorithm. For this reason we subtracted this
light by capturing an additional image of the reﬂections for
a completely black monitor image, and we subtracted this
image from all other images. The result was scaled down,
slightly cropped and completed to a size of 256×256 pixels.
The PSF was captured in a similar manner.
On this
image we applied robust and regularized
Richardson-Lucy deconvolution as described above (Fig-
ure 11). Deconvolution ran for 10’000 iterations in 15

pixels deﬁnitely exceeds numerical stability. In the case of
a monitor without a privacy screen no reconstruction would
be possible if the reﬂector is more than 6 cm away from
the scene. These simulated numbers nicely correlate with
our real experiments presented in Section 3.2: While simple
letters such as a “C” are still readable when shown with a
resolution of 3× 3 pixels, more complex letters such as “A”
and “B” are hardly readable with a resolution of 4×4 pixels.
4. Countermeasures
In this section we discuss how the attacks – reﬂections
in the eye and on stationary objects, as well as diffuse re-
ﬂections – can be prevented. Some simple countermeasures
immediately come to mind. Avoiding all reﬂecting objects
certainly provides some level of security. The main problem
with this approach is that the number of possibly dangerous
objects is vast, and that even eye-glasses and the human
eye can pose a threat. Still, avoiding as many objects as
possible makes the attack harder to carry out, so this measure
provides a medium level of security. Using window blinds
counters the attack in many cases. However, having the
windows always covered completely is not overly practical.
