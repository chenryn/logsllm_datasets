User: I just ran a python program in the Mac OS Terminal, and there is unusual memory leak.
The program is simple like this:

for i in xrange(1000000000, 2000000000, 10):
  i2 = i * i
  print i, i2, str(i2)[::2]
  if str(i2)[::2] == '1234567890':
    break

When the program is running, it consumes more and more memory till it use up all my memory.
When I terminate the program, my Terminal.app still consumes a lot of memory, so I guess it's a bug in Terminal.app?
Does anyone have similar experience?
Assistant: It's not Python that is leaking memory. Look closer. On my machine, the Python process remains at a quiet, stable 3.5 MB of memory.
The memory usage increment you see is most likely due to the Terminal not ever discarding output. You can alter this behavior going to Preferences, Settings, and setting the maximum line number to something else than "Unlimited".
