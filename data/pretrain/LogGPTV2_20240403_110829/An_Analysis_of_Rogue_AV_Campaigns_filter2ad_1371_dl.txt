To assess the effectiveness of client software downloads, we analyzed the number of unique IP addresses that performed a scan followed by a download on the same day. We also counted the IPs that did not proceed to download after scanning. Our analysis revealed 25,447 successful scans leading to downloads and 306,248 unsuccessful scans, resulting in an estimated conversion rate of 7.7% from scan to download.

Similarly, our data indicates a 1.36% conversion rate from scan to payment. Given an average price for rogue antivirus (AV) software ranging from $30 to $50, our analysis suggests that these six servers (which may be controlled by a single entity or multiple distinct entities) could generate a gross income between $111,000 and $186,000 over a 44-day period. However, this is a best-case scenario. It is likely that at least some of the accesses to the payment URL represent failed or non-existent payments, as we do not have access to the actual server responses.

If we apply a more conservative conversion rate of 0.26% between web server access and actual purchase, as estimated in the context of email spam [13], the gross income for rogue AV site operators would range from $21,000 to $35,000 over the same period. The total operational costs for these rogue AV sites include the cost of hosted web servers and the cost of registering 193 DNS domains. An informal survey of providers hosting rogue AV sites indicates that the average monthly cost of a hosted web server is $50, and annual domain registration costs vary between $3 and $10. Therefore, the total costs for rogue AV operators would range from $1,179 to $2,530 (potentially under $400 if domain registration is pro-rated for a 44-day period).

While the above cost estimate does not account for additional advertising expenses, these costs are likely covered by income from other illicit activities, such as keystroke loggers installed through drive-by downloads by the rogue AV servers.

Ultimately, the ease with which rogue AV campaigns lure users into purchasing their products generates a return on investment that fully justifies the deployment and management of complex infrastructures like those studied in this work.

### Lessons Learned and Countermeasures

This study leverages real data to analyze the general characteristics and dynamics of the threat landscape associated with rogue security software. We identify the specific features of this threat landscape and their foundations in a particularly favorable market. This knowledge has direct implications for current security practices and highlights weaknesses in existing techniques, as well as potential new research avenues.

**Users:**
Despite a few instances where rogue AV domains were associated with other threats like drive-by downloads, the primary propagation vector for this type of threat is the psychological impact on the user. While an in-depth study of the reasons behind the success of interactions between victims and rogue campaigns is beyond the scope of this work, our analysis clearly shows that users play a crucial role in the success of rogue AV campaigns. As suggested in [10], users often reject the necessity of monetary investments to protect against hypothetical security threats, making them vulnerable to rogue security software. Increasing user awareness about the implicit costs of security could reduce the high conversion rates observed in this study and impact the return on investment for rogue AV campaigns.

**Blacklisting Challenges:**
Our study revealed two characteristics of the infrastructure used to spread rogue AV that significantly affect the effectiveness of countermeasures, particularly blacklisting. As shown in Figure 1, the rogue AV infrastructure includes servers that exclusively host a large number of rogue AV sites and servers where rogue AV sites coexist with legitimate ones. This situation poses a worst-case scenario for blacklisting. IP-based blacklisting, which blocks access to a specific web server IP, can generate many false positives, preventing users from visiting benign sites hosted on the same IP as malicious sites. For example, a naive IP-based blacklisting approach listing all identified servers would incorrectly block access to 129,476 legitimate websites. Conversely, domain name-based blacklisting, which blocks access to a specific domain, is undermined by the ease with which malicious actors can register large batches of domains. For instance, 77 of the rogue-specific servers we tracked were associated with more than twenty different domains, with one server linked to a maximum of 309 domains.

**Taking Down Rogue AV Campaigns:**
An effective strategy to combat rogue AV campaigns might involve targeting payment processing sites. Our analysis of victim access data suggests that these sites are fewer in number and change less frequently. Disrupting the revenue-generating sites could significantly affect other parts of the rogue AV operations, such as registering new sites and paying for hosting.

**DNS-Based Threat Detection:**
This study underscores the critical role of the DNS infrastructure in Internet threats. Rogue AV campaigns often use misleading DNS names to gain users' trust (e.g., pcsecurity-2009.com). Additionally, these campaigns frequently lead to the automated deployment of large numbers of domains pointing to a few servers, following well-defined naming patterns. As noted in [20] for other types of threats, DNS appears to be a promising point of view for detecting such anomalies.

### Conclusion

We presented a longitudinal analysis of the infrastructure and dynamics associated with the increasingly popular threat of rogue security software. The contributions of this paper are threefold:
1. **Quantitative Analysis:** We provide the first quantitative high-level analysis of the rogue AV threat landscape and the underlying infrastructure, detailing the relationships between rogue AV domains and the web servers hosting them.
2. **Threat Attribution:** We applied a threat attribution methodology to 6,500 domains under observation, automatically extracting information on large-scale campaigns likely to be associated with the operation of a single individual or group, possibly using automated tools.
3. **Economic Insights:** We provided insights into the economy of the rogue AV threat landscape by analyzing the interaction of victim clients with several rogue AV servers over a 44-day period. Our findings show that rogue AV distributors can generate significant revenues, justifying their investment in the distribution infrastructure.

While this paper focuses specifically on the rogue antivirus threat, the methodologies and lessons learned can be valuable for studying other threats, such as phishing and other scams. Specifically, we demonstrate how clustering and data aggregation methods can be leveraged to profile different threat landscapes and offer a valuable tool for understanding threat economies.

### Fast-Flux Bot Detection in Real Time

**Ching-Hsiang Hsu, Chun-Ying Huang, and Kuan-Ta Chen**

**Abstract:**
Fast-Flux Service Networks (FFSN) have been widely adopted by bot herders to increase the productivity and extend the lifespan of botnets' domain names. A fast-flux botnet is unique in that each of its domain names is typically mapped to different sets of IP addresses over time, and legitimate users' requests are handled by machines other than those contacted by users directly. Most existing methods for detecting fast-flux botnets rely on the former property, requiring a certain period, maybe a few days, before a conclusion can be drawn.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect whether a web service is hosted by a fast-flux botnet in real time. Our scheme relies on intrinsic and invariant characteristics of fast-flux botnets, including:
1. **Request Delegation Model:** Requests are delegated to other machines (motherships).
2. **Non-Dedicated Bots:** Bots are not dedicated to malicious services.
3. **Inferior Hardware:** The hardware used by bots is generally inferior to that of dedicated servers.

Empirical evaluation results show that, using a passive measurement approach, the proposed scheme can detect fast-flux bots in a few seconds with over 96% accuracy, while the false positive and negative rates are both below 5%.

**Keywords:** Botnet, Request delegation, Document fetch delay, Processing delay, Internet measurement, Supervised classification.

**1. Introduction**

A botnet is a collection of compromised Internet hosts (bots) installed with remote control software developed by malicious users. Such software usually starts automatically when a host boots, allowing bot herders to coordinate large-scale Internet activities. According to the FBI's "Operation Bot Roast" project [7], more than one million victim IP addresses had been identified on the Internet by the end of 2007, and the number continues to grow. Botnets enable bot herders to engage in various malicious activities, such as launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, sending spam emails [24], hosting phishing sites [13], and making fraudulent clicks [5]. Statistics show that botnets yield significant economic benefits for bot herders [16, 15]; for example, Gartner [8] estimated that the economic loss caused by phishing attacks alone is as much as US$3 billion per year.

To help legitimate users avoid malicious services hosted on a bot, researchers and practitioners have investigated ways to determine whether a host is part of a botnet [10, 11, 9, 20]. If a bot is detected, the host owner can remove the remotely controlled software, or the network ISP can disconnect the bot if the host owner does not take appropriate action. Bot herders take countermeasures to keep their botnets alive and productive, particularly by using the Fast-Flux Service Network (FFSN) architecture to increase productivity and extend the lifetime of domain names linked to the bots.

**Fast-Flux Botnet Architecture:**
- **Domain Name Mapping:** A domain name is mapped to multiple IP addresses (possibly hundreds or thousands) rather than a single IP address. This ensures that the domain name is always resolved to a controllable and live bot, increasing productivity and reducing the risk of detection.
- **Request Handling:** Legitimate users' requests are indirectly handled by motherships rather than the bots. When a user accesses a service via a URL, the bot acts as a proxy, delegating the request to a mothership and forwarding the response to the user. This allows bot herders to update malicious services easily and reduces the footprint of the malicious software.
