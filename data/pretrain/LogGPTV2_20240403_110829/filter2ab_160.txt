# pwn02 (pwn 130p, 37 solved)
## Exploitation

1. **Add a Book with a Short Brief:**
   - The goal is to create a brief that can be expanded and edited during the use-after-free exploitation.

2. **Add a Best-Selling Book:**
   - This book will serve as the target for the use-after-free vulnerability via the "The best selling book today" section in the `List` output.

3. **Enter the Use-After-Free State:**
   - Deallocate the best-selling book by removing it *twice*. This step is necessary due to the specifics of the reference counting implementation.

4. **Leak `libc` Address:**
   - Enlarge the brief of the first book to reuse the memory chunk of the deallocated best-selling book.
   - Overwrite the brief pointer of the best-selling book with the location of a `.got` entry.
   - Execute the `List` command to leak the `libc` address.

5. **Execute an Interactive Shell:**
   - Overwrite the brief pointer and the formatter function of the best-selling book.
   - Call `system("/bin/sh")` by executing the `List` command.
