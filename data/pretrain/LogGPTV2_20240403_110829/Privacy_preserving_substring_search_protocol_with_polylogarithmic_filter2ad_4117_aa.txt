ABSTRACT
The problem of efficiently searching into outsourced en-
crypted data, while providing strong privacy guarantees,
is a challenging problem arising from the separation of data
ownership and data management typical of cloud-based ap-
plications. Several cryptographic solutions allowing a client
to look-up occurrences of a substring of choice in an out-
sourced document collection have been publicly presented.
Nonetheless, practical application requirements in terms of
privacy, security and efficiency actively push for new and im-
proved solutions. We present a privacy-preserving substring
search protocol exhibiting a sub-linear communication cost,
with a limited computational effort on the server side. The
proposed protocol provides search pattern and access pattern
privacy, while its extension to a multi-user setting shows
significant savings in terms of outsourced storage w.r.t. a
baseline solution where the whole dataset is replicated. The
performance figures of an optimized implementation of our
protocol, searching into a remotely stored genomic dataset,
validate the practicality of the approach exhibiting a data
transfer of less than 200 kiB to execute a query over a docu-
ment of 40 MiB, with execution times on client and server in
the range of a few seconds and a few minutes, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION
Current trends and innovations in the information technol-
ogy scenario have prompted users and organizations to store
a growing amount of sensitive data in a third party located
cloud, beyond their direct control. In such a scenario, com-
panies rely on the cloud for data storage and management,
profiting from low storage costs and high availability, while
end-users enjoy ubiquitous availability of data, which can
also be accessed via mobile devices. However, such benefits
come with a loss of control of the data itself and the concrete
possibility of privacy and security information leakages.
In this paper, we consider the popular cloud computing
model composed by three entities: the data owner, the cloud
server and the users authorized to access the remotely stored
data. The data owner stores the data on the cloud server
and authorizes the users to issue specific queries on the out-
sourced data. To protect the data, the data owner encrypts the
data before outsourcing them and shares the decryption keys
with the authorized users only. However, data encryption is
a major hindrance to perform data access operations, such
as searching for a given pattern, with the same efficiency
provided by the ones acting on data stored and maintained
on premise. Therefore, there is a pressing need for effec-
tive solutions enabling a set of querying functionalities on
encrypted data, possibly by multiple users, preserving the
confidentiality of the searched information even against the
service (storage) provider itself.

len(Di) and n=z
Problem Statement. A data owner outsources a set of doc-
uments D = {D1, . . . , Dz}, z ≥ 1, encrypted with a cryp-
tographic primitive of choice, where each document is a
sequence of symbols (string) over an alphabet Σ with length
i =1 len(Di). In addition, the data owner
builds an indexing data structure to enable the search for
any substring q ∈ Σ∗, len(q)=m ≥1, over D. A query for a
substring q will yield, for each document Di, 1 ≤ i ≤ z, the
set of positions, Si, where an occurrence of q appears. Along
with the collection of documents D, the data owner stores on
the remote storage a privacy-preserving representation of the
aforementioned indexing data structure allowing authorized
clients to use the substring search functionality with the
cooperation of the service provider. The main challenge in
this scenario is reducing the information learnt by an adver-
sary (including the service provider) to the knowledge of
the size of the outsourced document collection, the size of
the substring, the one of the indexing data structure and the
total number of occurrences matching the query at hand. We
remark that the private retrieval of the matching documents
from the remote storage is out of scope in the problem ad-
dressed by this paper, as this functionality can be achieved
by hinging upon existing cryptographic primitives such as
Oblivious RAMs (ORAMs) [27] or Private Information Re-
trieval (PIR) protocols [19].
Adversary and Security Model. In a real-world deploy-
ment of a privacy-preserving substring search solution, the
notion of semi-honest adversary fits well entities that trust-
worthy follows the protocol specification, although being
curious about any other additional information that may
be inferred with a polynomial computation effort about the
confidential data as well as the access patterns or the search
patterns on the remote data storage. Informally, a search
pattern refers to the understanding of how similar distinct
queries are (e.g., if they share a common prefix or only some
non consecutive symbols), while access pattern refers to the
understanding of the positions of replicas of the queried
substring in D.
Prior Art Approaches. The seminal work on searching
over data in an encrypted state [26] (a.k.a. searchable en-
cryption schemes) as well as many of the subsequent im-
provements in terms of computational and communication
resources [3, 8], relies on pre-registering searchable key-
words, and does not allow free form searching over the en-
crypted data. Such a limitation is overcome by substring
searchable encryption schemes [6, 15, 18, 28]. These schemes
exhibit computation/communication complexities linear or
quadratic in the length of the searched substring, with dif-
ferent server side storage savings and assumptions on the
adversary capabilities. While these solutions coped with the
problem of substring search, the works in [6, 18, 28] do not
provide protection of search and access pattern, while the
information leakage shown in [15] is not explicitly framed
as a search or access pattern one. The importance of pro-
tecting both the search and access pattern is demonstrated
by [5, 24], where the authors describe the recovery of either
a significant portion of the documents in the collection D or
the content of the queried substrings by combining search
and access pattern leakages with public information related
to the application domain itself.
Contributions. Substring searchable encryption schemes [6,
15, 18, 28] employ symmetric-key or order-preserving cryp-
tographic primitives, obtaining good performance figures
in terms of required bandwidth, computational power, and
storage demands on both clients and servers. However, they
do not take into account the information leakage coming
from the observation of both search and access patterns.
The higher security guarantees resulting from the inclu-
sion of such leakages in the security model comes along with
the usage of cryptographic primitives with higher computa-
tional complexity. We refer to substring search schemes pre-
serving search and access pattern confidentiality as privacy-
preserving substring search (PPSS) protocols.
In the following, we describe the first multi-user PPSS
protocol secure against semi- honest adversaries, with an
O(m log2
n) communication cost between client and service
provider. We combine the working principles of the Bur-
rows Wheeler Transform (BWT) [4] (as a method to perform
a substring search) with a single server private informa-
tion retrieval (PIR) protocol; specifically, we choose the PIR
proposed by Lipmaa in [19], which is based on the general-
ized Pailler homomorphic encryption scheme [9], because
of its limited communication cost. The solution exhibits an
O(m log4
n) computational cost and requires O(log n) mem-
ory on the client side, while the computational and stor-
age demands on the service provider side amount to O(mn)
and O(n), respectively. In a multi-user scenario, our PPSS
protocol allows distinct and simultaneous queries on the
same document collection, run by multiple clients without
any interaction with the data owner and among themselves.
Our multi-user approach avoids to replicate the outsourced
document collection for each authorized client, limiting the
additional memory required by each query to O(log2
n) cells.
2 RELATED WORK
In [30], the authors describe a PPSS protocol to establish
if a given substring is present in the outsourced document
collection with an O(n) communication cost and an imprac-
tical O(n) amount of cryptographic pairing computations
required at the client side for each query. Shimizu et. al.
in [25] described how to use the Burrows Wheeler Transform
(BWT) [4] and Pailler’s additive homomorphic encryption
(AHE) scheme [23] to effectively retrieve the occurrences
of a substring. The main drawback of the scheme lies in
the significant communication cost: each query needs to
√
n) ciphertexts from client to server. Such a cost
send O(m
was reduced by Ishimaki et. al. [16] to O(m log(n)), at the
price of employing a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)
scheme [13], making their solution unpractical. Indeed, FHE
schemes generally require ciphertexts bigger than the ones
exhibited by Pailler AHE scheme, introducing a significant
constant factor in the communication cost. Moreover, the
computational cost for the server is O(mn log(n)), which also
hides a large constant overhead (about 106) required to com-
pute on FHE ciphertexts.
A multi-user protocol, preserving only the search pattern
confidentiality and with communication cost linear in the
size of the searched substring is described in [10]. The main
drawbacks of this solution are the need for the client to
interact with both the data owner and the server to perform
a query, and the constraint that only substrings of a fixed
length, which must be decided when the privacy preserving
indexing data structure to be outsourced is built, can be
queried, in turn limiting the impact of the solution.

Finally, the suffix-array based solutions proposed by Moataz
et. al. in [22] guarantee the confidentiality of the content of
both the substring and the outsourced data, as well as the
