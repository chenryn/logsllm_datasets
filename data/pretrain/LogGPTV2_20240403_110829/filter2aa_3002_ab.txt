### World. Contracts, by contrast, generally affect only their parties.”). To establish secondary infringement, Blizzard must first demonstrate direct infringement. See A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1019, 1022 (9th Cir. 2001).

To establish direct infringement, Blizzard must show that it owns the copyright and that Glider users have violated one of its exclusive rights. *Id.* at 1013. MDY is liable for contributory infringement if it has "intentionally induced or encouraged direct infringement" by Glider users. *MGM Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.*, 545 U.S. 913, 930 (2005). MDY is liable for vicarious infringement if it (1) has the right and ability to control Glider users’ potentially infringing activities and (2) derives a direct financial benefit from these activities. *Id.* If Glider users are found to be directly infringing, MDY does not dispute that it satisfies the other elements of contributory and vicarious infringement.

### [2] As a copyright owner, Blizzard possesses the exclusive right to reproduce its work. 17 U.S.C. § 106(1). The parties agree that when playing *World of Warcraft* (WoW), a player’s computer creates a copy of the game’s software in the computer’s random access memory (RAM), a form of temporary memory used by computers to run software programs. This copy potentially infringes unless the player (1) is a licensee whose use of the software is within the scope of the license or (2) owns the copy of the software. See *Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.*, 188 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir. 1999) (“*Sun I*”); 17 U.S.C. § 117(a).

The Terms of Use (ToU) § 4(B), “Limitations on Your Use of the Service,” provides:
- You agree that you will not (ii) create or use cheats, bots, “mods,” and/or hacks, or any other third-party software designed to modify the *World of Warcraft* experience; or (iii) use any third-party software that intercepts, “mines,” or otherwise collects information from or through the Program or Service.

If the player owns the copy of the software, the “essential step” defense under 17 U.S.C. § 117(a)(1) allows the player to make a copy of the computer program as an essential step in utilizing the program with a machine without infringing.

### A. Essential Step Defense

We consider whether WoW players, including Glider users, are owners or licensees of their copies of WoW software. If WoW players own their copies, as MDY contends, then Glider users do not infringe by reproducing WoW software in RAM while playing, and MDY is not secondarily liable for copyright infringement.

In *Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.*, we distinguished between “owners” and “licensees” of copies for purposes of the essential step defense. *Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.*, 621 F.3d 1102, 1108-09 (9th Cir. 2010). We held that a software user is a licensee rather than an owner if the copyright owner (1) specifies that the user is granted a license; (2) significantly restricts the user’s ability to transfer the software; and (3) imposes notable use restrictions. *Id.* at 1111.

Applying *Vernor*, we hold that WoW players are licensees of WoW’s game client software. Blizzard reserves title in the software and grants players a non-exclusive, limited license. Blizzard also imposes transfer restrictions, such as requiring the transfer of all original packaging and documentation, permanent deletion of all copies and installations, and acceptance of the End User License Agreement (EULA) by the recipient. Additionally, players may not sell or give away the account.

Blizzard also imposes various use restrictions, such as limiting the game's use to non-commercial entertainment purposes, prohibiting unauthorized third-party programs, and allowing remote alterations to the game client. Blizzard may terminate the EULA and ToU if players violate their terms, ending the player’s license to access and play WoW. Following termination, players must immediately destroy their copies of the game and uninstall the game client from their computers.

Since WoW players, including Glider users, do not own their copies of the software, they cannot claim the essential step defense. Thus, when their computers copy WoW software into RAM, the players may infringe unless their usage is within the scope of Blizzard’s limited license.

### B. Contractual Covenants vs. License Conditions

A copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive, limited license typically waives the right to sue licensees for copyright infringement and can only sue for breach of contract. *Sun I*, 188 F.3d at 1121. However, if the licensee acts outside the scope of the license, the licensor may sue for copyright infringement. *Id.* (citing *S.O.S., Inc. v. Payday, Inc.*, 886 F.2d 1081, 1087 (9th Cir. 1989)).

We refer to contractual terms that limit a license’s scope as “conditions,” the breach of which constitutes copyright infringement. *Id.* at 1120. All other license terms are “covenants,” the breach of which is actionable only under contract law. *Id.* We distinguish between conditions and covenants according to state contract law, consistent with federal copyright law and policy. *Foad Consulting Group v. Musil Govan Azzalino*, 270 F.3d 821, 827 (9th Cir. 2001).

A Glider user commits copyright infringement by playing WoW while violating a ToU term that is a license condition. To establish copyright infringement, Blizzard must demonstrate that the violated term—ToU § 4(B)—is a condition rather than a covenant. *Sun I*, 188 F.3d at 1122. Blizzard’s EULAs and ToUs provide that they are to be interpreted according to Delaware law. Therefore, we first construe them under Delaware law and then evaluate whether that construction is consistent with federal copyright law and policy.

Under Delaware law, a covenant is a contractual promise, i.e., a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a particular way. *Travel Centers of Am. LLC v. Brog*, No. 3751-CC, 2008 Del. Ch. LEXIS 183, *9 (Del. Ch. Dec. 5, 2008). A condition precedent is an act or event that must occur before a duty to perform a promise arises. *AES P.R., L.P. v. Alstom Power, Inc.*, 429 F. Supp. 2d 713, 717 (D. Del. 2006). Conditions precedent are disfavored because they tend to work forfeitures. *Id.* Wherever possible, equity construes ambiguous contract provisions as covenants rather than conditions. *Wilmington Tr. Co. v. Clark*, 325 A.2d 383, 386 (Del. Ch. 1974). However, if the contract is unambiguous, the court construes it according to its terms. *AES*, 429 F. Supp. 2d at 717 (citing 17 Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 460 (2006)).

Applying these principles, ToU § 4(B)(ii) and (iii)’s prohibitions against bots and unauthorized third-party software are covenants rather than copyright-enforceable conditions. *Greenwood v. CompuCredit Corp.*, 615 F.3d 1204, 1212 (9th Cir. 2010). Although ToU § 4 is titled, “Limitations on Your Use of the Service,” nothing in that section conditions Blizzard’s grant of a limited license on players’ compliance with ToU § 4’s restrictions. Under Delaware law, ToU § 4(B) is a contractual covenant. *Cf. Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.*, 81 F. Supp. 2d 1026, 1031-32 (N.D. Cal. 2000) (“*Sun II*”).

To recover for copyright infringement based on breach of a license agreement, (1) the copying must exceed the scope of the defendant’s license, and (2) the copyright owner’s complaint must be grounded in an exclusive right of copyright (e.g., unlawful reproduction or distribution). *Storage Tech. Corp. v. Custom Hardware Eng’g & Consulting, Inc.*, 421 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2005). For example, a licensee who made a hundred copies of a book would be liable for copyright infringement because the copying would violate the Copyright Act’s prohibition on reproduction and exceed the scope of the license. Alternatively, if the licensee made a single copy but read the last ten pages, the only cause of action would be for breach of contract, because reading a book does not violate any right protected by copyright law. *Id.* at 1316.

Consistent with this approach, we have held that the potential for infringement exists only where the licensee’s action (1) exceeds the license’s scope and (2) implicates one of the licensor’s exclusive statutory rights. *See, e.g., Sun I*, 118 F.3d at 1121-22 (remanding for infringement determination where defendant allegedly violated a license term regulating the creation of derivative works).

Here, ToU § 4 contains certain restrictions grounded in Blizzard’s exclusive rights of copyright and others that are not. For instance, ToU § 4(D) forbids the creation of derivative works based on WoW without Blizzard’s consent. A player who violates this prohibition would exceed the scope of her license and violate one of Blizzard’s exclusive rights under the Copyright Act. In contrast, ToU § 4(C)(ii) prohibits a player’s disruption of another player’s game experience. A player might violate this prohibition by harassing another player with unsolicited instant messages. Although this conduct may violate the contractual covenants with Blizzard, it would not violate any of Blizzard’s exclusive rights of copyright. The anti-bot provisions at issue in this case, ToU § 4(B)(ii) and (iii), are similarly covenants rather than conditions. A Glider user violates the covenants with Blizzard but does not commit copyright infringement because Glider does not infringe any of Blizzard’s exclusive rights, such as altering or copying WoW software.

If we were to hold otherwise, Blizzard—or any software copyright holder—could designate any disfavored conduct during software use as copyright infringement by purporting to condition the license on the player’s abstention from the disfavored conduct. This would allow software copyright owners far greater rights than Congress has generally conferred on copyright owners. *Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.*, 772 F.2d 505, 511 (9th Cir. 1985).

We conclude that for a licensee’s violation of a contract to constitute copyright infringement, there must be a nexus between the condition and the licensor’s exclusive rights of copyright. Here, WoW players do not commit copyright infringement by using Glider in violation of the ToU. MDY is thus not liable for secondary copyright infringement, which requires the existence of direct copyright infringement. *Grokster*, 545 U.S. at 930.

It follows that because MDY does not infringe Blizzard’s copyrights, we need not resolve MDY’s contention that Blizzard commits copyright misuse. Copyright misuse is an equitable defense to copyright infringement, the contours of which are still being defined. *Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp. v. Am. Med. Ass’n*, 121 F.3d 516, 520 (9th Cir. 1997). The remedy for copyright misuse is to deny the copyright holder the right to enforce its copyright during the period of misuse. Since MDY does not infringe, we do not consider whether Blizzard committed copyright misuse.

We thus reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Blizzard on its secondary copyright infringement claims.
