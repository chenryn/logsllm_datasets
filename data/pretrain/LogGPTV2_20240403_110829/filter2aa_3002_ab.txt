world. Contracts, by contrast, generally affect only their par-
ties.”). To establish secondary infringement, Blizzard must
first demonstrate direct infringement. See A&M Records, Inc.
v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1019, 1022 (9th Cir. 2001).
To establish direct infringement, Blizzard must demonstrate
copyright ownership and violation of one of its exclusive
rights by Glider users. Id. at 1013. MDY is liable for contribu-
tory infringement if it has “intentionally induc[ed] or
encourag[ed] direct infringement” by Glider users. MGM Stu-
dios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 930 (2005). MDY
is liable for vicarious infringement if it (1) has the right and
ability to control Glider users’ putatively infringing activity
and (2) derives a direct financial benefit from their activity.
Id. If Glider users directly infringe, MDY does not dispute
that it satisfies the other elements of contributory and vicari-
ous infringement.

right to reproduce its work. 17 U.S.C. § 106(1). The parties
agree that when playing WoW, a player’s computer creates a

copy of the game’s software in the computer’s random access
memory (“RAM”), a form of temporary memory used by
computers to run software programs. This copy potentially
infringes unless the player (1) is a licensee whose use of the
software is within the scope of the license or (2) owns the
copy of the software. See Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft
Corp., 188 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir. 1999) (“Sun I”); 17
U.S.C. § 117(a). As to the scope of the license, ToU § 4(B),
“Limitations on Your Use of the Service,” provides:
You agree that you will not . . . (ii) create or use
cheats, bots, “mods,” and/or hacks, or any other
third-party software designed to modify the World of
Warcraft experience; or (iii) use any third-party soft-
ware that intercepts, “mines,” or otherwise collects
information from or through the Program or Service.
By contrast, if the player owns the copy of the software, the
“essential step” defense provides that the player does not
infringe by making a copy of the computer program where the
copy is created and used solely “as an essential step in the uti-
lization of the computer program in conjunction with a
machine.” 17 U.S.C. § 117(a)(1).
A. Essential step defense 
We consider whether WoW players, including Glider users,
are owners or licensees of their copies of WoW software. If
WoW players own their copies, as MDY contends, then
Glider users do not infringe by reproducing WoW software in
RAM while playing, and MDY is not secondarily liable for
copyright infringement. 
[3] In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., we recently distinguished
between “owners” and “licensees” of copies for purposes of
the essential step defense. Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., 621 F.3d
1102, 1108-09 (9th Cir. 2010; see also MAI Sys. Corp. v.
Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511, 519 n.5 (9th Cir. 1993);

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 11 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
Triad Sys. Corp. v. Se. Express Co., 64 F.3d 1330, 1333,
1335-36 (9th Cir. 1995); Wall Data, Inc. v. Los Angeles
County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 447 F.3d 769, 784-85 (9th Cir. 2006).
In Vernor, we held “that a software user is a licensee rather
than an owner of a copy where the copyright owner (1) speci-
fies that the user is granted a license; (2) significantly restricts
the user’s ability to transfer the software; and (3) imposes
notable use” restrictions. 621 F.3d at 1111 (internal footnote
omitted).
[4] Applying Vernor, we hold that WoW players are
licensees of WoW’s game client software. Blizzard reserves
title in the software and grants players a non-exclusive, lim-
ited license. Blizzard also imposes transfer restrictions if a
player seeks to transfer the license: the player must (1) trans-
fer all original packaging and documentation; (2) permanently
delete all of the copies and installation of the game client; and
(3) transfer only to a recipient who accepts the EULA. A
player may not sell or give away the account.
[5] Blizzard also imposes a variety of use restrictions. The
game must be used only for non-commercial entertainment
purposes and may not be used in cyber cafes and computer
gaming centers without Blizzard’s permission. Players may
not concurrently use unauthorized third-party programs. Also,
Blizzard may alter the game client itself remotely without a
player’s knowledge or permission, and may terminate the
EULA and ToU if players violate their terms. Termination
ends a player’s license to access and play WoW. Following
termination, players must immediately destroy their copies of
the game and uninstall the game client from their computers,
but need not return the software to Blizzard. 
[6] Since WoW players, including Glider users, do not
own their copies of the software, Glider users may not claim
the essential step defense. 17 U.S.C. § 117(a)(1). Thus, when
their computers copy WoW software into RAM, the players

Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 12 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
may infringe unless their usage is within the scope of Bliz-
zard’s limited license. 
B. Contractual covenants vs. license conditions
[7] “A copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive, limited
license ordinarily waives the right to sue licensees for copy-
right infringement, and it may sue only for breach of con-
tract.” Sun I, 188 F.3d at 1121 (internal quotations omitted).
However, if the licensee acts outside the scope of the license,
the licensor may sue for copyright infringement. Id. (citing
S.O.S., Inc. v. Payday, Inc., 886 F.2d 1081, 1087 (9th Cir.
1989)). Enforcing a copyright license “raises issues that lie at
the intersection of copyright and contract law.” Id. at 1122.
[8] We refer to contractual terms that limit a license’s
scope as “conditions,” the breach of which constitute copy-
right infringement. Id. at 1120. We refer to all other license
terms as “covenants,” the breach of which is actionable only
under contract law. Id. We distinguish between conditions and
covenants according to state contract law, to the extent consis-
tent with federal copyright law and policy. Foad Consulting
Group v. Musil Govan Azzalino, 270 F.3d 821, 827 (9th Cir.
2001). 
[9] A Glider user commits copyright infringement by play-
ing WoW while violating a ToU term that is a license condi-
tion. To establish copyright infringement, then, Blizzard must
demonstrate that the violated term — ToU § 4(B) — is a con-
dition rather than a covenant. Sun I, 188 F.3d at 1122. Bliz-
zard’s EULAs and ToUs provide that they are to be
interpreted according to Delaware law. Accordingly, we first
construe them under Delaware law, and then evaluate whether
that construction is consistent with federal copyright law and
policy.
A covenant is a contractual promise, i.e., a manifestation of
intention to act or refrain from acting in a particular way, such

Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 13 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
that the promisee is justified in understanding that the promi-
sor has made a commitment. See Travel Centers of Am. LLC
v. Brog, No. 3751-CC, 2008 Del. Ch. LEXIS 183, *9 (Del.
Ch. Dec. 5, 2008); see also Restatement (Second) of Con-
tracts § 2 (1981). A condition precedent is an act or event that
must occur before a duty to perform a promise arises. AES
P.R., L.P. v. Alstom Power, Inc., 429 F. Supp. 2d 713, 717 (D.
Del. 2006) (citing Delaware state law); see also Restatement
(Second) of Contracts § 224. Conditions precedent are disfa-
vored because they tend to work forfeitures. AES, 429 F.
Supp. 2d at 717 (internal citations omitted). Wherever possi-
ble, equity construes ambiguous contract provisions as cove-
nants rather than conditions. See Wilmington Tr. Co. v. Clark,
325 A.2d 383, 386 (Del. Ch. 1974). However, if the contract
is unambiguous, the court construes it according to its terms.
AES, 429 F. Supp. 2d at 717 (citing 17 Am. Jur. 2d Contracts
§ 460 (2006)).
[10] Applying these principles, ToU § 4(B)(ii) and (iii)’s
prohibitions against bots and unauthorized third-party soft-
ware are covenants rather than copyright-enforceable condi-
tions. See Greenwood v. CompuCredit Corp., 615 F.3d 1204,
1212, (9th Cir. 2010) (“[H]eadings and titles are not meant to
take the place of the detailed provisions of the text,” and . . .
“the heading of a section cannot limit the plain meaning of the
text.” (quoting Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Balt. & Ohio R.R.,
331 U.S. 519, 528—29 (1947))). Although ToU § 4 is titled,
“Limitations on Your Use of the Service,” nothing in that sec-
tion conditions Blizzard’s grant of a limited license on play-
ers’ compliance with ToU § 4’s restrictions. To the extent that
the title introduces any ambiguity, under Delaware law, ToU
§ 4(B) is not a condition, but is a contractual covenant. Cf.
Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 81 F. Supp. 2d
1026, 1031-32 (N.D. Cal. 2000) (“Sun II”) (where Sun
licensed Microsoft to create only derivative works compatible
with other Sun software, Microsoft’s “compatibility obliga-
tions” were covenants because the license was not specifically
conditioned on their fulfillment).

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 14 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
To recover for copyright infringement based on breach of
a license agreement, (1) the copying must exceed the scope of
the defendant’s license and (2) the copyright owner’s com-
plaint must be grounded in an exclusive right of copyright
(e.g., unlawful reproduction or distribution). See Storage
Tech. Corp. v. Custom Hardware Eng’g & Consulting, Inc.,
421 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Contractual rights,
however, can be much broader:
[C]onsider a license in which the copyright owner
grants a person the right to make one and only one
copy of a book with the caveat that the licensee may
not read the last ten pages. Obviously, a licensee
who made a hundred copies of the book would be
liable for copyright infringement because the copy-
ing would violate the Copyright Act’s prohibition on
reproduction and would exceed the scope of the
license. Alternatively, if the licensee made a single
copy of the book, but read the last ten pages, the
only cause of action would be for breach of contract,
because reading a book does not violate any right
protected by copyright law.
Id. at 1316. Consistent with this approach, we have held that
the potential for infringement exists only where the licensee’s
action (1) exceeds the license’s scope (2) in a manner that
implicates one of the licensor’s exclusive statutory rights. See,
e.g., Sun I, 118 F.3d at 1121-22 (remanding for infringement
determination where defendant allegedly violated a license
term regulating the creation of derivative works).

nation where licensee exceeded the license’s scope by preparing a modi-
fied version of software programs without licensor’s authorization); LGS

Cir. 2006) (licensor likely to prove infringement where licensee used

use may have included unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and public

[11] Here, ToU § 4 contains certain restrictions that are
grounded in Blizzard’s exclusive rights of copyright and other
restrictions that are not. For instance, ToU § 4(D) forbids cre-
ation of derivative works based on WoW without Blizzard’s
consent. A player who violates this prohibition would exceed
the scope of her license and violate one of Blizzard’s exclu-
sive rights under the Copyright Act. In contrast, ToU
§ 4(C)(ii) prohibits a player’s disruption of another player’s
game experience. Id. A player might violate this prohibition
while playing the game by harassing another player with
unsolicited instant messages. Although this conduct may vio-
late the contractual covenants with Blizzard, it would not vio-
late any of Blizzard’s exclusive rights of copyright. The anti-
bot provisions at issue in this case, ToU § 4(B)(ii) and (iii),
are similarly covenants rather than conditions. A Glider user
violates the covenants with Blizzard, but does not thereby
commit copyright infringement because Glider does not
infringe any of Blizzard’s exclusive rights. For instance, the
use does not alter or copy WoW software.
Were we to hold otherwise, Blizzard — or any software
copyright holder — could designate any disfavored conduct
during software use as copyright infringement, by purporting
to condition the license on the player’s abstention from the
disfavored conduct. The rationale would be that because the
conduct occurs while the player’s computer is copying the
software code into RAM in order for it to run, the violation
is copyright infringement. This would allow software copy-
right owners far greater rights than Congress has generally
conferred on copyright owners.

ments as copyright infringements for several reasons. First, breach of con-

[12] We conclude that for a licensee’s violation of a con-
tract to constitute copyright infringement, there must be a
nexus between the condition and the licensor’s exclusive
rights of copyright.
4 Here, WoW players do not commit copy-
right infringement by using Glider in violation of the ToU.
MDY is thus not liable for secondary copyright infringement,
which requires the existence of direct copyright infringement.
Grokster, 545 U.S. at 930.
It follows that because MDY does not infringe Blizzard’s
copyrights, we need not resolve MDY’s contention that Bliz-
zard commits copyright misuse. Copyright misuse is an equi-
table defense to copyright infringement, the contours of which
are still being defined. See Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp. v. Am.
Med. Ass’n, 121 F.3d 516, 520 (9th Cir. 1997). The remedy
for copyright misuse is to deny the copyright holder the right
to enforce its copyright during the period of misuse. Since
MDY does not infringe, we do not consider whether Blizzard
committed copyright misuse.
We thus reverse the district court’s grant of summary judg-
ment to Blizzard on its secondary copyright infringement
tract damages are generally limited to the value of the actual loss caused
by the breach. See 24 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts § 65:1 (4th
ed. 2007). In contrast, copyright damages include the copyright owner’s
actual damages and the infringer’s actual profits, or statutory damages of
up to $150,000 per work. 17 U.S.C. § 504; see Frank Music Corp. v.
