User: How to use Python to quickly obtain server CPU, memory, disk and other information in batches?
Assistant: You can use the psutil module and os module in Python to obtain information such as the CPU, memory, and disk of the server. The specific implementation steps are as follows: 1. Import the required modules```python import psutil import os ``` 2. Obtain CPU information```python # Obtain the number of CPUs cpu_count = psutil.cpu_count() print('Number of CPUs:' , cpu_count) # Get CPU usage cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1, percpu=True) print('CPU usage:', cpu_usage) ``` 3. Get memory information```python # Get total physical memory Quantity total_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().total print('Total physical memory:', total_memory, 'bytes') # Get physical memory usage memory_usage_percent = psutil.virtual_memory().percent print('Physical memory usage:' , memory_usage_percent, '%') ``` 4. Get disk information```python # Get the total disk capacity and usage disk_usage = psutil.disk_usage('/') print('Total disk capacity:', disk_usage.total, 'bytes') print('Disk used:', disk_usage.used, 'bytes') # Get disk usage disk_usage_percent = disk_usage.percent print('Disk usage:', disk_usage_percent, '%') ``` 5 .Get system information```python # Get system startup time boot_time = psutil.boot_time() print('System startup time:', boot_time) # Get current operating system information os_info = os.uname() print('Operating system information :', os_info) ``` The above are some basic information acquisition methods of CPU, memory, disk, etc., which can be expanded and customized according to actual needs.
