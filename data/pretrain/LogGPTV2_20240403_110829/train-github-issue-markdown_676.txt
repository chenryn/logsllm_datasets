#### Describe the workflow you want to enable
As a continuation to 18105, I would like to propose a feature addition to
Decision Tree to enable them to handle categorical variables.
#### Describe your proposed solution
The solution will be to update `fit` and `predict` method of
`BaseDecisionTree` class in _classes.py. As mentioned in 18105
`OrdinalEncoder` will be used to encoded categorical variables.
#### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
Althernatives were `OneHotEncoder` or `Dummy` variables but they will make the
algorithm slower
