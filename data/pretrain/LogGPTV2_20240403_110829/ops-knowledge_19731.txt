I understand that you are encountering an issue when attempting to open a file from a Python script that is being executed via Jenkins. Both the file you are trying to open and the Python script are located in the same directory, but you are receiving the following error:

```
fopen: No such file or directory
```

You have already tried setting the `PATH` environment variable in Jenkins using the command:

```sh
export PATH="/file path:$PATH"
```

However, the error persists. Interestingly, the script runs successfully when executed from the terminal.

### Suggested Solution

1. **Use Absolute Paths:**
   Instead of relying on relative paths, use the absolute path to the file. You can utilize the `$WORKSPACE` environment variable provided by Jenkins, which points to the workspace directory where your job is running. Hereâ€™s how you can modify your Python script to use the absolute path:

   ```python
   import os

   # Get the absolute path to the file
   file_path = os.path.join(os.environ['WORKSPACE'], 'your_file_name.txt')

   # Open the file
   with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
       content = file.read()
       print(content)
   ```

2. **Check File Existence:**
   Before attempting to open the file, you can check if the file exists at the specified path. This can help in debugging:

   ```python
   import os

   file_path = os.path.join(os.environ['WORKSPACE'], 'your_file_name.txt')

   if os.path.exists(file_path):
       with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
           content = file.read()
           print(content)
   else:
       print(f"File not found: {file_path}")
   ```

3. **Verify Jenkins Workspace:**
   Ensure that the file is indeed present in the Jenkins workspace. You can add a step in your Jenkins pipeline to list the contents of the workspace directory for verification:

   ```sh
   echo "Listing files in $WORKSPACE:"
   ls -la $WORKSPACE
   ```

4. **Permissions:**
   Check the file permissions to ensure that the Jenkins user has the necessary read permissions for the file.

5. **Environment Variables:**
   Verify that the `WORKSPACE` environment variable is correctly set in your Jenkins job. You can print the value of `WORKSPACE` in your script to confirm:

   ```python
   import os

   print(f"Workspace: {os.environ['WORKSPACE']}")
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `fopen: No such file or directory` error and successfully open the file from your Python script in Jenkins.
