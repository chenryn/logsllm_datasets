User: I'm trying to open a file from a python script which am running from jenkins. Both the files (which am trying to open and the python script) are in same location. But when am running the script, am getting error,
fopen: No such file or directory
am running 
export PATH="/file path:$PATH"
in jenkins before running my script.
But still am getting the fopen error.
Am able to run the script from terminal
Assistant: maybe you can use the $WORKSPACE var to have a full path for the fopen command.
