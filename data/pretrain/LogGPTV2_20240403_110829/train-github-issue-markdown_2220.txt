I found a very, very small error in pubspec.yaml.
## Steps to Reproduce
Create fresh flutter project, and
  1. Create `Image.asset` in main.dart
  2. Uncomment the `assets` section to add a sample image asset
  3. Try to run app
Then, an error occurs: `Error on line 40, column 4 of pubspec.yaml: Expected a
key while parsing a block mapping. assets: ^ Unable to reload your application
because "flutter packages get" failed to update package dependencies.
Exception: pub get failed (65)`
## Solution
All you have to do to fix it is to add one space before `uses-material-design:
true`. By default intendation is broken.
PS When you know how to fix it, it takes 3 seconds, but you still need some
time to find a solution on the Internet. But it isn't what we would call
"seamless experience". Also, as you could see, error log doesn't give usable
hint
