Assistant: Git is a popular version control system that helps you manage your code. The following are the steps to use Git for code management: 1. Install Git First you need to install Git on your computer. It can be downloaded from the official website and installed according to the instructions. 2. Create a Git repository In your project directory, use the command line tool to run the following command: ``` git init ``` to convert this directory into a Git repository. 3. Add files Add the files to be managed to the Git repository: ``` git add <file> ``` 4. Commit changes Commit changes: ``` git commit -m "commit message" ``` Enter your commit message . 5. Create a branch Use the following command to create a new branch: ``` git branch <branch_name> ``` will create a new branch named `<branch_name>`. 6. Switch branches Use the following command to switch branches: ``` git checkout <branch_name> ``` will checkout to the branch named `<branch_name>`. 7. Merge branches Use the following command to merge a branch into the current branch: ``` git merge <branch_name> ``` will merge the branch named `<branch_name>` into the current branch. 8. Push to the remote repository Use the following command to push the local branch to the remote repository: ``` git push origin <branch_name> ``` will push the local changes to the branch named `<branch_name>` in the remote repository. The above are the basic steps to use Git to manage code. Remember, Git can do a lot more, so exhaustive study is required to realize its full potential.
