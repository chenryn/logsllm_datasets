### Communities and User Distribution Across Regions

Our applications have a user base distributed across various regions, and we observed no significant relationship between the size of a community and the number of contributing countries. To further analyze this, we measured the number of users from the same country within each community (referred to as 'local users') and reported the maximum number of local users for the 51 largest communities in Figures 10g, 10h, and 10i. The results indicate that while some communities have a high proportion of local users, this proportion varies significantly across different communities, particularly for GL and Hugged. For FC, the community sizes, excluding the largest one, are much smaller, making it difficult to draw similar conclusions.

### Facebook Network Locality

We also examined the locality of Facebook networks within each community. According to Facebook's definition, users are classified into networks based on school, college, work, and regional categories. However, our findings, as shown in Figures 10j, 10k, and 10l, reveal that these network definitions do not effectively capture the community structures on social applications. This is contrary to our expectation that users within the same work-related network would have a higher degree of real-world interaction, which should translate into more online interactions, especially on Online Social Networks (OSNs). Additionally, users within the same network are expected to be mutual friends more often than those from different networks, as supported by [6].

### Scalability and Clustering Coefficient

To assess the scalability of our applications, we used the clustering coefficient, a key metric for evaluating the extent of user grouping. We sought to identify high clustering of nodes, which could facilitate segregated data processing. Table 3 presents the clustering coefficients for FC, GL, and Hugged, along with those of Erdős-Rényi random graphs for comparison. The results show that the clustering in interaction graphs for FC, GL, and Hugged is significantly higher than in random graphs. Combined with the low diameters of these graphs (as shown in Table 3), this indicates that the interaction networks on our applications are small-world networks [12]. While this suggests potential solutions to scalability issues, we do not explore this further in this paper.

### Distinguishing Gaming Applications

Social gaming is rapidly becoming a major category of applications on platforms like Facebook, driven by high user engagement. To understand the differences in community structures and other characteristics of our gaming application, FC, compared to GL and Hugged, we analyzed user behavior.

We conducted a comparative analysis of daily bandwidth, Daily Active Users (DAU), and the average time spent on the site for FC, GL, and Hugged over a 60-day period (Figure 11). For FC, significant drops in DAU did not result in a corresponding decrease in bandwidth consumption. Furthermore, as the number of unique active users declined, the average time spent on FC increased, a characteristic not observed in GL.

Another distinguishing feature of FC is the relationship between the frequency of user activity and the fraction of their friends who subscribe to the application. Figure 12 illustrates this relationship, showing that the frequency of occurrence is related to the subscribing percentage of friends only for FC, a gaming application. This highlights an important aspect of FC: the probability of a user's activity depends on the subscribing fraction of their friends. This implies that social games may require a longer "warm-up" period before achieving popularity. However, once many friends subscribe, users find it harder to reduce their involvement in the game. This is supported by the high average number of subscribing friends for FC in Figure 13.

### Comparing Social Games to Other Online Games

While social games like FC share some similarities with other online multiplayer games such as CounterStrike, there are significant differences in their deployment and traffic patterns. Social games rely on HTTP/TCP traffic, whereas games like CounterStrike use UDP to handle the bursty nature of gameplay. Additionally, social games exhibit a diurnal traffic pattern, closely tied to the geographical spread and internet activity of OSN users, unlike the non-varying 24-hour pattern seen in traditional online multiplayer games.

### Concluding Discussion

This study provides an initial look at the usage and subscription characteristics of OSN-based applications and the nature of user interactions. Our analysis of global application usage data shows that once an application becomes popular, it tends to retain its ranking. New applications face increasing difficulty in achieving similar popularity as more established ones attract more users. 

In terms of community structure, interaction graphs for FC lack the strong community structures seen in GL and Hugged. This is partly due to FC users forming friendships with "strangers" through the application, which distorts the underlying friendship graph and reduces natural community structures. Despite high clustering in interaction graphs, the communities are geographically diverse, and Facebook's network definitions do not capture these structures effectively.

Scalability issues in high-traffic web applications can potentially be addressed by segregating data into non-overlapping or minimally overlapping chunks. However, our results suggest that geographical or network-wise segregation does not help social applications. Further research is needed to explore how data segregation can be effectively implemented to address scalability.
