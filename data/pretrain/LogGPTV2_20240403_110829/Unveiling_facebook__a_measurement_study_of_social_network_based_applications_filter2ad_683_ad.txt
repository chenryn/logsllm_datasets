communities on our applications consisted of users in many
diverse regions, and that there is a lack of relationship be-
tween the community sizes and number of contributing coun-
tries. On a related note, we also measured the number of
users belonging to the same country for each community
(termed ‘local users’), and report the maximum number of
local users per community for the 51 largest communities in
Figures 10g, 10h, and 10i. Our results show that although
for some communities the proportion of users with the same
locality might be high, the proportion seems to vary consid-
erably across communities for GL and Hugged. We may not,
however, infer the same results for FC, where community
sizes excluding the largest community are much smaller.
Considering Facebook-network locality per community, we
found that Facebook’s deﬁnition of networks15, too, does not
capture community structures on social applications, as can
be seen by the large number of contributing networks per
community in Figures 10j, 10k, and 10l. This is contrary
to our expectations that users who are on the same, say,
work-related network have a relatively higher degree of real-
world interaction, which is expected to translate into online
interaction, especially on OSNs. Furthermore, more users
belonging to the same network are expected to be mutual
friends than users belonging to diﬀerent networks. This ob-
servation is supported by [6].
14Detection of community structure is an optimization prob-
lem for ﬁnding a division of vertices so that the resulting
structure coeﬃcient for the graph G is maximized.
15‘Networks’ in this context refer to Facebook’s classiﬁcation
of users into networks of school, college, work, and regional
categories.
With regards to scalability, an important metric for gaug-
ing the extent of grouping of users on our applications is
the clustering coeﬃcient.
In particular, we look for the
existence of high clustering of nodes on our applications,
which may result in possible ways for segregated processing
of data. We report the clustering coeﬃcients for FC, GL,
and Hugged in Table 3, and report clustering coeﬃcients of
Erd os-R´enyi random graphs (with same number of nodes
and edges) alongside for comparison. It can be seen that as
compared to random graphs, clustering in interaction graphs
for FC, GL, and Hugged is very high. High clustering com-
bined with the low diameters for all three graphs (Table 3)
means interaction networks on our applications are actually
small-world networks [12]. While this may hint at solutions
to scalability issues on social applications, we do not explore
this issue further in this paper.
6. DISTINGUISHING GAMING
APPLICATIONS
As mentioned before, social gaming is fast becoming a
major category of applications on social sites such as Face-
book. This is due to high user engagement resulting from
the use of gaming applications in general. In order to gauge
the reasons for diﬀerences in characteristics such as diﬀer-
ing community structures for our gaming application, FC
(as compared to GL and Hugged), we need to consider user
behavior.
We performed a comparative analysis of daily bandwidth,
DAU, and daily average time spent by users on site. Figure
11 shows a 60-day long snapshot of bandwidth consumption,
daily unique users, and average time spent on site from FC,
GL, and Hugged.
One can see that for FC, signiﬁcant drops in DAU resulted
in no signiﬁcant decrease in bandwidth consumption for the
60-day period tracked. Plotting daily average time on site
for FC shows that with a decline in the number of unique
active users, the average time users spent on FC increased.
Note that GL does not exhibit this characteristic16.
Another distinguishing characteristic of FC comes to light
if we consider the fraction of a user’s friends that subscribe
to applications. Users may appear in our trace either if they
perform activities on other users through the applications, or
other users perform activities targetting them. We plot the
frequency of occurrence of users in our 3-week trace against
the subscribing fraction of friends in Fig. 12. It can be seen
that frequency of occurrence is related to the subscribing
percentage of friends only for FC, a gaming application.
The last result highlights an important feature of FC (and
perhaps social gaming applications in general): the proba-
bility of activity for a given user depends on the subscrib-
ing fraction of friends. This has implications in that social
games may require higher ‘warm up’ time as compared to
other social applications before ‘achieving popularity’. How-
ever, since gaming activity is related to friends’ subscription
to the application, this also implies that users with many
16Data for average time spent on site for Hugged was unavail-
able for the entire 60-day snapshot and hence is not shown
in Fig. 11. However, the average time spent for Hugged is
∼2min 40s based on the data that is available. This matches
average time spent on GL (∼2min 20s). Therefore, we ex-
pect the results for GL to be representative of Hugged.
subscribing friends may ﬁnd it more diﬃcult to stop or even
lower their involvement in the game. Considering the high
average number of subscribing friends for FC in Figure 13,
this, in fact, helps explain our previous result from Fig. 11.

average number of activities for FC is much higher than that
for Hugged and GL. This makes intuitive sense since FC is
an interactive multiplayer gaming application, and playing
a game calls for multiple activites on part of a user. The
somewhat surprising result, however, is that FC users on

average have a greater number of friends overall, as well
as have a greater number of friends subscribing to the ap-
plication. Furthermore, the number of friends subscribing
to the application relative to the total number of friends is
greater for FC than for our non-gaming applications. We
discuss this further in relation to community structures in

mind that (at least with FC) we still see bursts of Inter-
net traﬃc, especially when sizable games (i.e., games with
high number of participating individuals) approach the end
of their durations. Furthermore, traﬃc on social games is
pull-based, whereas other online multiplayer games (for e.g.,
CounterStrike and Half-Life) use a push-based virtual broad-
casting approach to disseminate information to players [3].
This clearly limits social games to non-realtime gameplay.
The study in [3] has highlighted the non-varying 24-hour
pattern of traﬃc seen at gaming servers for CounterStrike,
Half-Life, etc. This is not the case with social games, in that
traﬃc is very closely determined by the OSN’s geographical
spread of users and their internet activity (i.e., we see a di-
urnal pattern, rather than a non-varying temporal pattern,
of traﬃc for online social games). Furthermore, given the
nature of social games and the wider audience of social net-
works, the geographical spread of users in social games is
higher than that for other online multiplayer games such as
CounterStrike.

6.1 Comparing Social Games to Other Online
Games
On the topic of distinguishing social gaming applications
like FC, we noted the high probabilistic activity of users and
its relation with the proportion of subscribing friends for the
application. We further remarked at how usage might per-
sist over time for individuals with a high proportion of sub-
scribing friends online. Intuitively, we imagine the same phe-
nomenon should occur for other online multiplayer games as
well. In particular, online multiplayer games such as Coun-
terStrike seem close in comparison to online gaming on social
networks. However, there are major diﬀerences in the de-
ployment of the two types of games, and these diﬀerences
provide for some limitations for gaming on social networks
given the status of developer platforms today.
One of the major diﬀerences between social games such as
FC and games in CounterStrike’s multiplayer genre is that
having been developed speciﬁcally for OSNs, social games
rely on HTTP/TCP traﬃc, whereas CounterStrike and the
like employ UDP to cater to the bursty nature of the game-
play seen in online multiplayer games. It should be kept in
This paper presents a ﬁrst look at the usage and subscrip-
tion characteristics of OSN-based applications as well as the
nature of interaction between users in the context of such
applications. The data we gathered by launching our three
indigenous applications using the Facebook Developer Plat-
form represents a valuable resource since it provided us with
ﬁrst-hand information about such applications launched on
an OSN.
Our analysis of global application usage data shows that
applications, once popular, remain strong and tend to retain
their rankings. It is natural for users to stumble upon more
popular applications more often than, say, up-and-coming
applications. This has implications for newcomers, most
important of which is that as time passes and more appli-
cations amass popularity, it becomes increasingly harder for
smaller applications to achieve similar popularity, i.e., an ap-
plication tends to attract users based on how many existing
users subscribe to/actively use it. We did, however, see ex-
ceptions where newly launched applications quickly gained
popularity to climb rankings.
In our study, we speciﬁcally looked at interaction as seen
on applications when considering formation of communities
online. We saw that interaction graphs on FC do not exhibit
community structure, while those for GL and Hugged ex-
hibit strong community structures. One reason for the lack
of community structure on FC is the tendency for FC users
to form friendships with ‘strangers’ using the application.
This has been witnessed on especially ﬁghting-oriented so-
cial gaming applications, and we believe this is the primary
reason for the high average number of subscribing friends
(for FC) seen in Fig. 13. We believe this behavior distorts
the underlying friendship graph of the social network, re-
sulting at least in loss of (natural) community structure.
We also found that even though applications’ interaction
graphs had high clustering of nodes, the community struc-
tures extracted were formed of many diverse geographical
locations. We showed that Facebook’s deﬁnition of net-
works, which attempts to capture community structures,
fails to lend meaning to communities (at least) on appli-
cations. Through anecdotal evidence, we also highlighted
the fact that with high level of activity and the traﬃc gen-
erated, especially on viral social gaming applications such
as FC, scalability issues come to light fairly early in the ap-
plication’s lifetime.
One way to alleviate scalability problems for high traf-
ﬁc web applications is to segregate information into non-
overlapping (or minimally overlapping) chunks. These chunks
can then be placed into diﬀerent locations (for example, in
a distributed database), primarily to increase speed of pro-
cessing requests. Our results show that separating data ge-
ographically or network-wise does not help social applica-
tions. However, the existence of strong clustering in on-
line activity hints at the existence of a possibility for reach-
ing scalability through data segregation. Further study is
needed to explore how exactly this can be achieved.
We believe our three applications provide a reasonably
rich set of activity data for a meaningful analysis of social
application usage. FC, GL, and Hugged are inherently dif-
ferent in the nature of their user interactions. For exam-
ple, GL and Hugged only contain friend-to-friend interac-
tions while FC involves interactions with non-friends as well.
We also expect other social gaming applications (especially
competition-based social games) to have characteristics that
are more similar to FC than GL or Hugged. Recognizing
that online social applications span a wide variety of cate-
gories, further studies are needed to investigate the degree
to which our preliminary ﬁndings hold generally, as social
networking paradigms continue to evolve. Furthermore, the
degree to which our results apply to applications on OSNs
with demographics diﬀerent from Facebook (such as MyS-
pace) also remains to be seen.
In summary, we feel this study is an important ﬁrst step
towards exploring a modern class of fast growing Internet
applications and means of communication.
