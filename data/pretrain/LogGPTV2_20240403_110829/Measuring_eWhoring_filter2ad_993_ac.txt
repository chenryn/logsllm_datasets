### Limitations of Reverse Search and Domain Classification

Our results are limited by the scope of the reverse search, as private social network profiles might not be indexed. Additionally, both TinEye and the Wayback Machine may be incomplete, meaning that an image recorded after it was posted in a forum does not necessarily imply it was not available earlier. To confirm the actual timestamps, one would need to visit the URLs, but this is impractical for automated processing and unethical or technically challenging for manual visits.

Regarding domain classification tools, we followed the same approach used in previous research (e.g., [28]) for URL categorization. However, our results may be biased due to the generally unknown accuracy of such services. Other limitations include:
1. The vagueness of some categories, which hinders a thorough analysis.
2. The lack of classification for some domains, particularly significant in the case of OpenDNS (22%).
3. Potential discrepancies between the categories provided by different services.

### Financial Profits in Underground Forums

Underground forums attract actors interested in easy money-making methods. During our analysis, we observed eWhoring actors boasting about their earnings for various purposes, often to attract new participants or compare incomes. Threads with titles like "Post your earnings" or "How much do you make?" are common. Users regularly share their earnings on a daily or weekly basis, while others provide overall figures. Some users also share earnings to promote services (e.g., mentoring or teaching) or products (e.g., e-books or image packs).

To establish credibility, most users provide proof-of-earnings in the form of images showing payments received, such as screenshots of PayPal and Amazon Gift Card (AGC) dashboards, confirmation emails, receipts, or pictures of cash. These images are typically uploaded to image-sharing sites like Imgur or Gyazo.

### Methodology and Analysis of Proof-of-Earnings Images

We analyzed 2,000 proof-of-earnings images shared in underground forums. Our methodology involved extracting posts related to earnings using heuristics. We searched for eWhoring-related threads containing keywords like "you make" or "earn" in their headings. We also included threads from the "Bragging Rights" board on Hackforums, which discusses earnings from various underground activities. This query yielded 1,084 threads, from which we extracted 725 posts containing links to image-sharing sites. Additionally, we queried the dataset for posts containing the keyword "proof" with trading-related terms, resulting in 551 more posts. In total, we extracted 2,694 unique URLs, primarily from Hackforums (89%).

Using our crawler, we downloaded 2,366 images. To ensure we only analyzed proof-of-earnings, we applied an NSFV classifier and the IWF hashlist to filter out indecent content. After filtering, we analyzed 2,067 images, of which 199 were not proof-of-earnings (e.g., chat screenshots, error images, or banners). This left us with 1,868 images (78.9% of the total) showing earnings.

We annotated the images with the following information: payment platform (e.g., PayPal, Amazon), currency (GBP, USD, EUR), number of transactions, time span, total amount, language, and any other relevant details. For images with multiple currencies, we manually converted them to the most frequently used currency and then automatically converted all rates to USD using historical exchange rates.

### Analysis of Earnings and Financial Activity

Overall, 661 actors posted proof-of-earnings, totaling over US$511k. The average reported per actor is US$774. Most actors report earnings less than US$1k, either because they made little money or did not share all their earnings. Actors reporting higher profits tend to share their earnings more frequently. For instance, more than 50% of actors reporting more than US$5k have posted 8 or more images. One actor posted 46 images, reporting earnings of US$18,097.12 between March 2017 and December 2018.

Of the 1,868 images, around 60% (1,116) show detailed information about incoming transactions (dates and amounts). The average amount per transaction is US$41.90. Most transactions range from US$5 to US$50, typically corresponding to the trading of a few image sets. Larger transactions (US$200 or more) are usually for video encounters or extended periods. Earnings shared to promote services or goods, such as mentoring or ebooks, were also observed.

### Evolution of Payment Platforms

We analyzed the threads started by eWhoring actors in the Currency Exchange board on Hackforums, which is used to convert earnings into different virtual currencies (e.g., from PayPal to BTC). This board provides an indicator of the financial activity of forum actors. Most threads follow a standard format where the currency offered follows the tag [H] and the currency wanted follows the tag [W]. We used this format to identify the currencies traded by eWhoring actors. To focus on eWhoring-related activities, we only included Currency Exchange threads from actors who have written more than 50 posts in eWhoring threads.

In summary, while our results provide an estimation of the actual profits generated by eWhoring, they must be viewed with caution due to the potential for falsified images and the selective sharing of earnings.
