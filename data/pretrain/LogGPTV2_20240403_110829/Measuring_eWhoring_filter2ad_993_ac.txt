from private social network profiles might not be indexed). Thus,
our results are also limited by the scope of the reverse search. Fi-
nally, we note that both TineEye and the Wayback machine might
470
be incomplete, so an image recorded (crawled) after it was posted
in the forum does not imply that it was not available before. It
would be needed to get actual timestamps from the pages stating
otherwise, but that seems unlikely with automated processing (and
due to ethical and technical reasons we did not manually visit the
URLs.)
As for the domain classification tools, we follow the same ap-
proach used by previous work (e.g., [28]) to perform URL categori-
sation. Despite this, our results might be biased since the accuracy
of such services is generally unknown. Other limitations include:
(i) the vagueness of some of the categories, which makes it impos-
sible to conduct a thorough analysis, (ii) the lack of classification
for some domains, which is quite large in the case of OpenDNS
(22%), and (iii) the potential discrepancies between the categories
provided by different services.
5 FINANCIAL PROFITS
Underground forums bring together actors interested in easy money
making methods.During our analysis of underground forum data,
we observed eWhoring actors boasting about their earnings for
a variety of purposes. In most cases, it appears this is aimed at
attracting new actors or for comparing incomes, with threads titles
such as ‘Post your earnings’ or ‘How much you make?’. Some users
regularly post in response to these threads, providing their earnings
on a daily or weekly basis. Others share their overall earnings.
In other cases, earnings are shared to promote a service (e.g.,
mentoring or teaching) or products (e.g., e-books or packs of im-
ages). While some users post their incomes without providing proof,
this is considered untrustworthy and is not accepted by the com-
munity. Thus, most users provide proof-of-earnings in the form of
images showing payments received, such as screenshots showing
the dashboard of the platform used (typically PayPal and Ama-
zon Gift Cards) that contain account balances and transactions;
confirmation emails; receipts; or even pictures of cash. Similar to
the previews used to promote packs of images (see ğ4), proof-of-
earnings are uploaded to image sharing sites such as imgur or
Gyazo.
We analysed 2k of these proof-of-earnings images shared in
underground forums. We first present our methodology to retrieve
and process the images. We then provide the results of our analysis,
including the types of payment platforms used and the reported
earnings over time and by actor. We recall that these images can be
falsified, e.g. to inflate earnings and brag about their capabilities,
and thus our results must be seen as an approximation to actual
earnings.
5.1 Measurement pipeline
To estimate the income generated by eWhoring, we developed a
methodology for downloading and extracting information from
proof-of-earning images. First, we extracted posts related with
the sharing of earnings using a set of heuristics. We searched for
eWhoring related threads containing the words ‘you make’ or ‘earn’
in their heading. We also included eWhoring threads from a board
in Hackforums called ‘Bragging Rights’ (used to discuss earnings
from a variety of underground activities). This query yielded 1 084
threads, from which we extracted 725 posts containing links to

image sharing sites. We also queried the dataset for posts containing
the keyword ‘proof’ with trading-related terms (see Table 2). This
way, we obtained a further 551 posts containing links to image
sharing sites. We applied regular expressions to extract the URLs.
In total, we extracted 2 694 unique URLs from 1 276 posts. Most of
these (89%) are from Hackforums.
Using our crawler described in ğ4.2, we downloaded a total of
2 366 images. While our aim was to download proof-of-earnings, the
images downloaded could also contain indecent content (e.g. pack
previews). Accordingly, we followed the same precautions taken
when downloading the packs and previews. First we applied the
NSFV classifier to avoid visualising indecent images, and the IWF
hashlist to detect child abuse material. After filtering out indecent
images (no child abuse material was found), we were able to analyse
2 067 images.
We manually analysed the images and found 199 were not proof-
of-earnings. These were, for example, screenshots of chats with
customers, error images, or banners. Thus, we found a total of 1 868
images (78.9% of the total downloaded) showing earnings.
We annotated the images with the following information: pay-
ment platform (e.g., Paypal, Amazon, etc.); currency (GBP, USD,
EUR, etc.); number of transactions; time span; total amount; lan-
guage; and any other relevant information (such as notes left by
the user).Some images included transactions in multiple currencies,
which were manually converted to the most frequently used cur-
rency included in the proof-of-earning. We then converted automat-
ically all rates to USD. In both cases, we use a historical exchange
rate list to get the corresponding rate when the transaction was
performed.
Additionally, we analysed the threads started by eWhoring actors
in the Currency Exchange board on Hackforums. This board is used
to transform earnings into different virtual currencies, e.g., from
PayPal to BTC. Thus, it is an indicator of the financial activity
of forum actors. Most of the threads in this board use a de-facto
standard format where the currency offered follows the tag [H] and
the currency wanted follows the tag [W]. We leverage this format
to automatically identify the currencies traded by eWhoring actors.
To restrict our analysis to activities related to eWhoring, we only
include Currency Exchange threads from actors who have write
more than 50 posts in eWhoring-threads.
5.2 Analysis
Overall, there are 661 actors that posted proof-of-earnings, totalling
more than US$511k. The average reported per actor is US$774. As
shown in the left chart in Figure 2, most actors report earnings
less than US$1k. Either they made little money, or they have not
shared all their earnings. Indeed, the actors reporting the highest
profits are those who share their earnings regularly. The right chart
in Figure 2 shows that, in general, actors reporting more earnings
provide more proof-of-earnings. For instance, more than 50% of
actors reporting more than US$5k have posted 8 or more images.
We observe a single actor who posted 46 images, reporting earnings
of US$18 097.12 between March 2017 and December 2018. Note that
actors sharing earnings account for around a 30% of the actors
that have made more than 50 posts, and those providing proofs
might show only a small proportion of their actual earnings. Also,
some images could be falsified to inflate earnings. Thus, our results
must be viewed as an estimation of the actual profits generated by
eWhoring.
Of the 1 868 images, around 60% (1 116) show detailed infor-
mation about the incoming transactions (i.e. dates and amounts).
From these, we calculate the average amount per transaction is
US$41.90. Some of the proof-of-earnings are accompanied with
notes indicating the source of the transactions. From these, we
observe most of the transactions are between US$5 and US$50, and
usually correspond with the trading of a few set of images. Larger
transactions (of US$200 or more) are payments for video encounters
or extended periods of time. We also observe earnings shared to
promote services or goods, such as mentoring or ebooks.
