Resolves network basic input/output system 
(NetBIOS) names to IPv4 addresses. A sample 
Lmhosts file (Lmhosts.sam) is included by default. You 
can create a different file named Lmhosts or you can 
rename or copy Lmhosts.sam to Lmhosts in this 
folder. For more information, see Chapter 11, 
"NetBIOS over TCP/IP." 
Networks 
Resolves network names to IPv4 address prefixes. 
Protocol 
Resolves protocol names to RFC-defined protocol 
numbers. A protocol number is a field in the IPv4 
header that identifies the upper-layer protocol (such as 
TCP or UDP) to which the IPv4 packet payload should 
be passed. 
Services 
Resolves service names to port numbers and protocol 
names. Port numbers correspond to fields in the TCP 
or UDP headers that identify the application using TCP 
or UDP.

Windows uses these mappings to send data on the 
local network. 
Hostname 
Displays the host name of the computer. 
Ipconfig 
Displays current TCP/IP configuration values for both 
IPv4 and IPv6. Also used to manage DHCP 
configuration and the DNS client resolver cache. 
Lpq 
Displays the status of print queues on print servers 
running Line Printer Daemon (LPD) software. 
Nbtstat 
Checks the state of current NetBIOS over TCP/IP 
connections, updates the Lmhosts cache, and 
determines the registered names and scope ID. 
Netsh 
Displays and allows you to administer settings for IPv4 
or IPv6 on either the local computer or a remote 
computer. 
Netstat 
Displays statistics and other information about current 
IPv4 and IPv6 connections. 
Nslookup 
Queries a DNS server. 
Ping 
Tests IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity to other IP nodes. 
Route 
Allows you to view the local IPv4 and IPv6 routing 
tables and to modify the local IPv4 routing table. 
Tracert 
Traces the route that an IPv4 or IPv6 packet takes to a 
destination. 
Pathping 
Traces the route that an IPv4 or IPv6 packet takes to a 
destination and displays information on packet losses 
for each router and subnet in the path. 
Table 1-5  TCP/IP diagnostic tools in Windows 
After you have configured TCP/IP, you can use the Ipconfig and Ping tools to verify and test the 
configuration and connectivity to other TCP/IP hosts and networks. 
The Ipconfig Tool 
You can use the Ipconfig tool to verify the TCP/IP configuration parameters on a host, including the 
following: 
For IPv4, the IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway. 
For IPv6, the IPv6 addresses and the default router. 
Ipconfig is useful in determining whether the configuration is initialized and whether a duplicate IP 
address is configured. To view this information, type ipconfig at a command prompt. 
Here is an example of the display of the Ipconfig tool for a computer running Windows XP that is using 
both IPv4 and IPv6: 
C:\>ipconfig

Type ipconfig /all at a command prompt to view the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of DNS servers, the IPv4 
addresses of Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) servers (which resolve NetBIOS names to IP 
addresses), the IPv4 address of the DHCP server, and lease information for DHCP-configured IPv4 
addresses. 
The Ping Tool 
After you verify the configuration with the Ipconfig tool, use the Ping tool to test connectivity. The Ping 
tool is a diagnostic tool that tests TCP/IP configurations and diagnoses connection failures. For IPv4, 
Ping uses ICMP Echo and Echo Reply messages to determine whether a particular IPv4-based host is 
available and functional. For IPv6, Ping uses ICMP for IPv6 (ICMPv6) Echo Request and Echo Reply 
messages. The basic command syntax is ping Destination, in which Destination is either an IPv4 or 
IPv6 address or a name that can be resolved to an IPv4 or IPv6 address. 
Here is an example of the display of the Ping tool for an IPv4 destination: 
C:\>ping 157.60.136.1

    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), 
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: 
    Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 1ms, Average = 0ms 
To verify a computer’s configuration and to test for router connections, do the following: 
1. Type ipconfig at a command prompt to verify whether the TCP/IP configuration has initialized. 
2. Ping the IPv4 address of the default gateway or the IPv6 address of the default router to verify 
whether they are functioning and whether you can communicate with a node on the local network. 
3. Ping the IPv4 or IPv6 address of a remote node to verify whether you can communicate through a 
router. 
If you start with step 3 and you are successful, then you can assume that you would be successful with 
steps 1 and 2. 
Note  You cannot use the Ping tool to troubleshoot connections if packet filtering routers and host-based 
firewalls are dropping ICMP and ICMPv6 traffic. For more information, see Chapter 13, "Internet Protocol 
Security (IPsec) and Packet Filtering." 
Network Monitor 
You can use Microsoft Network Monitor to simplify troubleshooting complex network problems by 
monitoring and capturing network traffic for analysis. Network Monitor works by configuring a network 
adapter to capture all incoming and outgoing packets.  
You can define capture filters so that only specific frames are saved. Filters can save frames based on 
source and destination MAC addresses, source and destination protocol addresses, and pattern 
matches. After a packet is captured, you can use display filtering to further isolate a problem. When a 
packet has been captured and filtered, Network Monitor interprets and displays the packet data in 
readable terms. 
Network Monitor 3.1 is a free download from Microsoft.  
Windows Server 2003 includes a version of Network Monitor that can capture data for the local 
computer only. To install Network Monitor in Windows Server 2003, do the following: 
Chapter 1 – Introduction to TCP/IP

1. Click Start, point to Control Panel, click Add or Remove Programs, and then click Add/Remove 
Windows Components. 
2. In the Windows Components wizard, click Management and Monitoring Tools, and then click 
Details.  
3. In Management And Monitoring Tools, select the Network Monitor Tools check box, and then 
click OK.  
4. If you are prompted for additional files, insert the product CD, or type a path to the location of the files 
on the network.  
Note  To perform this procedure, you must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group on the 
local computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority. If the computer is joined to a 
domain, members of the Domain Admins group might also be able to perform this procedure.  
To analyze network traffic with Network Monitor, you must start the capture, generate the network traffic 
you want to observe, stop the capture, and then view the data. The procedures for capturing and 
analyzing network traffic vary with the version of Network Monitor. For more information, see the 
Network Monitor help topics.

Chapter Summary 
The chapter includes the following pieces of key information: 
TCP/IP is an industry-standard suite of protocols that are designed for large-scale networks. The 
TCP/IP protocol suite includes both the IPv4 and IPv6 sets of protocols. 
The standards for TCP/IP are published in a series of documents called RFCs. 
On a TCP/IP-based network, a router can forward packets that are not addressed to the router, a host 
cannot, and a node is either a host or a router. 
On a TCP/IP-based network, a subnet is one or more LAN segments that are bounded by routers and 
that use the same IP address prefix, and a network is two or more subnets connected by routers. 
The IPv4-based TCP/IP component in Windows is the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or 
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component in Network Connections. This component is installed by default, 
and you cannot uninstall it. You configure it either automatically (by using DHCP or an alternate 
configuration) or manually (by using Network Connections or the Netsh tool). 
The IPv6-based TCP/IP component in Windows is the Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6), Microsoft 
TCP/IP Version 6, or Microsoft IPv6 Developer Edition component in the Network Connections folder. 
For Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, the Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) component is 
installed by default. For Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the IPv6-based TCP/IP component is 
not installed by default, and you can uninstall it. You configure it either automatically (with IPv6 address 
autoconfiguration) or manually (by using the Network Connections folder or the Netsh tool). 
Ipconfig and ping are the primary tools for troubleshooting basic IP configuration and connectivity. 
You can use Network Monitor to troubleshoot complex network problems by capturing and viewing 
network traffic for analysis.

Chapter Glossary 
address – An identifier that specifies the source or destination of IP packets and that is assigned at the 
IP layer to an interface or set of interfaces. 
APIPA – See Automatic Private IP Addressing. 
Automatic Private IP Addressing  – A feature in Windows that automatically configures a unique IPv4 
address from the range 169.254.0.1 through 169.254.255.254 and a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. 
APIPA is used when TCP/IP in Windows is configured for automatic addressing, no DHCP server is 
available, and the Automatic Private IP Address alternate configuration option is chosen. 
host – A node that is typically the source and a destination of IP traffic. Hosts silently discard received 
packets that are not addressed to an IP address of the host. 
interface – The representation of a physical or logical attachment of a node to a subnet. An example of 
a physical interface is a network adapter. An example of a logical interface is a tunnel interface that is 
used to send IPv6 packets across an IPv4 network. 
IP – Features or attributes that apply to both IPv4 and IPv6. For example, an IP address is either an 
IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. 
IPv4 – The Internet layer protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite as defined in RFC 791. IPv4 is in 
widespread use today. 
IPv6 – The Internet layer protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite as defined in RFC 2460. IPv6 is gaining 
acceptance today. 
LAN segment – A portion of a subnet that consists of a single medium that is bounded by bridges or 
Layer 2 switches. 
neighbor – A node that is connected to the same subnet as another node. 
network – Two or more subnets that are connected by routers. Another term for network is internetwork. 
node – Any device, including routers and hosts, which runs an implementation of IP. 
packet – The protocol data unit (PDU) that exists at the Internet layer and comprises an IP header and 
payload. 
Request for Comments (RFC) - An official document that specifies the details for protocols included in 
the TCP/IP protocol suite. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) creates and maintains RFCs for 
TCP/IP. 
RFC – See Request for Comments (RFC). 
router – A node that can be a source and destination for IP traffic and can also forward IP packets that 
are not addressed to an IP address of the router. On an IPv6 network, a router also typically advertises 
its presence and host configuration information.  
subnet – One or more LAN segments that are bounded by routers and that use the same IP address 
prefix. Other terms for subnet are network segment and link. 
TCP/IP – See Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) – A suite of networking protocols, including 
both IPv4 and IPv6, that are widely used on the Internet and that provide communication across 
interconnected networks of computers with diverse hardware architectures and various operating 
systems. 
upper-layer protocol – A protocol above IP that uses IP as its transport. Examples of upper-layer 
protocols include Internet layer protocols such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and 
Transport layer protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram 
Protocol (UDP).

Abstract 
This chapter examines the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol suite in greater detail, 
analyzing its four layers and the core protocols used within each layer. Network administrators must have an 
understanding of the core protocols in the various layers and their functions to understand how networking applications 
work, how data is sent from one application to another, and how to interpret network captures. This chapter also 
discusses the two main application programming interfaces (APIs) that networking applications for the Microsoft 
Windows operating systems use and the APIs’ naming schemes.
