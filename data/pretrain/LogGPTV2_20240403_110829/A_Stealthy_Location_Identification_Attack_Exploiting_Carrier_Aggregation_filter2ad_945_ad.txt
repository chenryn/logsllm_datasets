paths in a building when considering 1-2 minute short walks.
Walking all possible 1-2 minute paths (perhaps, multiple times
per path) in practice, therefore, would result in an extremely
labor-intensive experiment. Instead, we carefully synthesize
all possible paths in the building using the 46 short paths (or
path segments) we measure separately. The synthesized paths
represent the large number of plausible paths taken by the
victim within primary cell coverage.
For path synthesis, we construct a graph that is made of
the above forty-six short path segments as the edges. Figure 9
shows the graph for a large building we test. We superimpose
the ﬂoor plan of the building for easier interpretation. The
graph has 23 edges (46 directed edges) and 17 vertices where
every edge connecting any two vertices are collected paths.
We ﬁrst construct as many distinct paths as possible by
ﬁnding all random walks without repetition (i.e., no walk on
the same segment in a path regardless of the direction). Table 2
shows the number of synthesized paths for different path
length ranges. As expected, we can create more distinct paths
for longer path lengths. When enumerating for the path length
of [500, 550) meters, we can ﬁnd 1,307 different paths in the
building, after which the number gradually decreases for even
longer paths due to the limited building size. Then, we obtain
ﬁngerprints for the new synthesized paths. We randomly pick
the walks from ten collected ﬁngerprints for each path and
form the new synthesized ﬁngerprint by concatenating them.
7.2 Attack Evaluation
We present the main evaluation results of the SLIC, focusing
on two attack cases: (1) a SLIC adversary ﬁngerprints all
plausible paths of a victim user, and (2) a SLIC adversary
ﬁngerprints some plausible paths of a victim user.

low false positives.
7.2.1 Attack Case 1: Fingerprinting All Plausible Paths
This attack case models a resource-rich adversary where it is
feasible to ﬁngerprint all plausible paths of the victim within
primary cell coverage. This is, in fact, similar to our experi-
ment setup where we exhaustively search all possible indoor
paths in the large buildings as shown in Figure 9.
Figure 10 depicts the path-identiﬁcation accuracy of SLIC
for varying numbers of ﬁngerprinted paths (100, 200, and
300) with increasing path distance. We evaluate the path-
identiﬁcation accuracy for varying path distance (from 200
to 650 meters). We consider nine labeled ﬁngerprints per
path and 100 victim’s ﬁngerprints and perform ﬁve iterations
each time by randomly choosing both labeled and victim’s
ﬁngerprints. We consider that the victim is fully utilizing all
the available secondary cells at each location. Figure 10 in-
dicates that the accuracy increases when the victim walks
longer paths. For example, the identiﬁcation accuracy of 100
ﬁngerprinted path increases from 94% to 98.4% as the dis-
tance of the path increases from 200-250 meters to 600-650
meters. Note that we omit the data point at the path distance
of 200-250 meters for 300 ﬁngerprinted paths because only
291 paths are available; see Table 2.
7.2.2 Attack Case 2: Fingerprinting Some Plausible
Paths
In the second attack case, we model a resource-constrained
adversary whose best effort reconnaissance may ﬁngerprint
the majority of (but not all) plausible paths that could be
taken by a victim. Thus, a victim may walk a path that is not
ﬁngerprinted by an adversary (or unexplored path).
In this evaluation, we randomly select 300 ﬁngerprinted

paths from a total of 624 possible paths with a path distance
of 300-350 meters whereas the remaining 324 paths (i.e., 624-
300 = 324) are unexplored paths. We then evaluate for 100
victim’s ﬁngerprint in which 80 are ﬁngerprinted paths and
20 are unexplored paths. We perform ﬁve iterations each time
randomly choosing both labeled and victim’s ﬁngerprints. Fig-
ure 11 shows the ROC curve for 300 ﬁngerprinted paths with
the x-axis as the false positive rate (i.e., the ratio of unex-
plored paths falsely identiﬁed as ﬁngerprinted paths) and the
y-axis as the true positive rate (i.e., the ratio of ﬁngerprinted
paths correctly identiﬁed as a ﬁngerprinted path) for varying
distance thresholds. The large area under the curve indicates
a high true positive rate for a relatively low false positive rate.
Note that care must be taken in this evaluation because
some unexplored paths may share some path segments with
the ﬁngerprinted paths. For example, an unexplored path 6-7-
11-17 shares two path segments with a ﬁngerprinted path 6-7-
11-15. If we use such unexplored paths and ﬁngerprinted paths
with the shared path segments, our results can be biased due
to the artifact of path synthesis. To address this, we remove
such unexplored paths from the data set and ﬁnally obtain
only 87 unexplored paths for the experiment above.
8 How Reliable
is
the SLIC Attack? —
Additional Evaluations
One remaining question is whether the SLIC can reliably iden-
tify the path taken by a victim in various environments and
operating scenarios. In this section, we perform two additional
evaluations to answer: (1) whether the SLIC attack effective-
ness depends on different physical environments, particularly
various types of building structures (§8.1); and (2) whether
the SLIC attack can still identify the path when a victim UE
does not fully utilize its downlink bandwidth (§8.2). In addi-
tion, we also analyze the effect of minor perturbation of the
received radio signal indicator (RSSI) values due to environ-
ment changes and transmit power control (TPC) algorithms
in the modern wireless systems; refer Appendix D for details.

rectly (i.e., not going through the path synthesis) for path
identiﬁcation. The measured paths are thus longer than the
short path segments we choose for Section 7. We have walked
a total of 45 unique paths in the ﬁve buildings, collecting
10-14 ﬁngerprints per path with an average distance of 128
meters, totaling 63 km in 12 hours.
We classify the ﬁve buildings we have walked into three
types of building structures to demonstrate the effect of build-
ing structures on the uniqueness of the paths and ultimately
on SLIC’s performance. The three types are corridors (e.g.,
ofﬁces), open spaces (e.g., libraries), and shared ﬂoors (e.g.,
malls), as illustrated in Figure 12.
To evaluate the performance of SLIC for different building
types, we vary the number of labeled ﬁngerprints per path (for
all 45 distinct paths) from one to nine (yielding a range of 45
to 405 ﬁngerprints). We also select 30 victim’s ﬁngerprints
and evaluate for 100 iterations each time picking labeled and
victim’s ﬁngerprints randomly. Figure 13 depicts the overall
identiﬁcation accuracy for all building types when varying the
number of labeled ﬁngerprints per path. The overall accuracy
increases to 92.3% with nine labeled ﬁngerprints per path, as
depicted by the black solid curve. Figure 13 also depicts the
individual accuracy for corresponding labeled and victim’s
ﬁngerprints collected for speciﬁc building types.
We observe that the corridors (orange dashed line) and the
open spaces (blue dotted line) yield higher accuracy com-
pared to the shared ﬂoors (green dash-dot curve). This is most
likely because the ﬁrst two yield more unique ﬁngerprints
than the latter due to their building structure. To conﬁrm our
conjecture, we plot the probability density function for the
total number of conﬁgured cells in our dataset in Figure 14.
The plot indicates that the corridors and open spaces have
a wider distribution compared to the shared ﬂoors, meaning
the ﬁngerprints on these buildings have a wider range for
variations in their values. Moreover, we compute the average
entropy of the ﬁngerprints of paths for each of the building
types to check that open spaces and corridors indeed exhibit
more variation hence more unique ﬁngerprint. The result-

accuracy even at low data usage compared to corridors or
shared ﬂoors. The reason can be inferred from Figure 14
which indicates that the open spaces have lower values of
side-channel information, which are accurately captured by
the calibrated ﬁngerprints leading to better accuracy.

ing average entropy conﬁrms our conjecture with corridors,
open spaces, and shared ﬂoors each yielding 1.73, 1.67, and
1.00, respectively. Consequently, the identiﬁcation accuracy
of corridors and open spaces is higher than shared ﬂoors.
8.2 SLIC with Limited Downlink Activity
We evaluate the performance of SLIC when the victim has
limited downlink data usage, thereby requiring only some of
the conﬁgured secondary cells to be activated. We also evalu-
ate across different building types. To simulate varying data
usage of the victim, we limit the maximum number of conﬁg-
ured secondary cells that can be utilized at any given point in
