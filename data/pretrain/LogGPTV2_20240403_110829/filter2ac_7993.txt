**ATT&CK ID:** T1481.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** One-Way Communication

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external web service channel to send commands to a compromised system without receiving any return output. This technique involves leveraging popular websites and social media platforms to host command and control (C2) instructions. The compromised system can then execute these commands and, if necessary, send the output back through a different C2 channel, which may be another distinct web service. In some cases, adversaries may choose not to receive any output at all, particularly when they only need to issue instructions to the compromised system and do not require a response.
