### RT2WIN! How 50 Lines of Python Made Me the Luckiest Guy on Twitter

#### Introduction
- **Name:** Hunter
- **Profession:** Electrical and Computer Engineer
- **Location:** Silicon Valley
- **Current Work:** Disrupting social, local, mobile, and big data analytics with cloud-based MapReduce deployments on Docker using Rust.

#### Origin
The idea began with a simple observation: "There are numerous contests on Twitter. All you have to do to enter is retweet them." This sparked the question, "How hard could it possibly be?"

1. **Step 1:** Look for contests and retweet them.
2. **Step 2:** Profit.

Initially, I used basic search terms like "rt2win," "rt to win," "rt 2 win," and "retweet to win." I utilized the Twitter API, but encountered rate limits. To address this, I added random delays between retweets.

#### Better Solution
To improve efficiency:
- **FIFO Follow Queue:** Turned the follow queue into a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) system.
- **Unfollow Mechanism:** Unfollowed the first account when I reached the 2000th follow.
- **Time Management:** The time it takes to enter 2000 contests requiring follows is sufficient for the first contest to end, ensuring a steady flow of entries.
- **Side Effect:** Gained more real followers as people followed back out of courtesy, making my bot appear more legitimate.

#### Interesting Interactions
- **Duplicate Wins:** I forgot to change my name on one of my accounts, leading to winning the same contest twice.
- **Bots vs. Bots:** Encountered someone offering a postcard signed by me as a prize.
- **Accidental Jerkiness:** My bot sometimes inadvertently caused friction.
- **False Positives:** There were instances where my bot misidentified contests.

#### The Haul

- **Most Valuable Prize:** A $4000 trip to Fashion Week in NYC (taxes paid).

#### Stats
- **Total Contests Entered:** 165,000
- **Average Wins:** 4 wins per day, every day, for 9 months straight.

#### Other Attempts
- **Initial Landscape:** Before my project, only a few people were auto-entering Twitter contests.
- **Current Situation:** Now, many people attempt to do the same, though not all are successful.

#### How to Keep Me from Winning
- **Read the Feed:** Take a moment to review the winner's feed; it will often be obvious.
- **Stealth Measures:** Some people use stealth tactics, making it harder to catch them.
- **Programmatic Entry Barriers:** Add elements that require natural language processing.
- **Alternative Platforms:** Consider running contests on Facebook, which has stricter identity verification.

#### Conclusion
Despite no attempts at stealth, I still managed to win consistently. Accept that people will always try to game contests, but with the right measures, you can make it more challenging for them.
