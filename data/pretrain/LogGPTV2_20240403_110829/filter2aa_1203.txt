RT2WIN!
How 50 lines of Python made me the luckiest guy on Twitter
“No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want. So I am.”
Introduction
• I’m Hunter
• Electrical & Computer Engineer
• Working in Silicon Valley
• Currently disrupting social local mobile big data analytics with 
cloud based MapReduce deployments on Docker with Rust
Origin
• “Hey, there’s a ton of contests on Twitter. All you have to do to 
enter them is retweet them…”
xkcd.com
“How hard could it possibly be?”
• Step 1: Look for contests, retweet them
• Step 2: Profit
• Started with simple search terms at first
• “rt2win”, rt to win”, “rt 2 win”, “retweet to win”, etc
• Used the Twitter API
• Rate limit = 
• So, retweet slower, add random delays
+
Beautiful Soup
Better solution
• Turn the follow queue into a FIFO
• Unfollow the 1st account when I follow the 2000th account
• The amount of time it takes to enter 2000 contests that require 
following is enough that the 1st contest is almost certainly over 
by then
• Side effect: I get more real followers because people follow back 
as a courtesy.
• My bot actually looks more legit now
Interesting interactions
Forgot to change my name on one of my 
accounts that won the same contest as 
another one…
Yes, I won this.
Bots vs Bots
Someone offering a postcard signed by 
ME as a prize…
Sometimes my bot was accidentally a 
jerk 
Guess who?

Yes, I paid the taxes.
Other attempts
• Before I did this, there were at most a few people auto-entering 
twitter contests
• Couldn’t find any obvious examples 
• Did see some manual examples
• Now a lot of people do it
• Or at least, they try
Often imitated, never duplicated
How to keep me from winning
• Take two seconds and read the feed of the winner
• It will usually be pretty obvious.
• I made no attempt at stealth and still won. Some people do attempt 
stealth and are much harder to catch
• Make it hard to programmatically enter
• Add something that requires natural language processing
• Consider running the contest on Facebook
• Much harder to make a fake but convincing profile
• Tied to real identity
• Accept that people always try to game contests
