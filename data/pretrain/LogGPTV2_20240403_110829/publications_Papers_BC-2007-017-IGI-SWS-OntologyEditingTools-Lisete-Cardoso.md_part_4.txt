#### Data Storage and Access
Data is stored in a relational database, which can be accessed using the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) standard.

#### Knowledge Model in WebODE
WebODE utilizes a highly expressive knowledge model for ontologies. This model is based on the intermediate representations defined by the Methontology methodology (Laera and Tamma, 2005). The key components of WebODE’s knowledge model include:
- **Concepts and Local Attributes**: Both instance and class attributes, with types that can be any XML Schema type.
- **Concept Groups**: Represent sets of disjoint concepts.
- **Concept Taxonomies**: Include disjoint and exhaustive class partitions.
- **Ad Hoc Binary Relations**: Between concepts, characterized by properties such as symmetry and transitivity.
- **Constants**.
- **Formal Axioms**: Expressed in first-order logic.
- **Rules**.
- **Instances of Concepts and Relations**.

#### Tools and Features
WebODE includes several tools and features:
- **Ontology Editor**: Offers three user interfaces:
  - **HTML Form-Based Editor**: For editing all ontology terms except axioms and rules.
  - **Graphical User Interface (OntoDesigner)**: For a more visual approach.
  - **WAB (WebODE Axiom Builder)**: For editing formal axioms and rules.
- **Ontology-Based Knowledge Management System (ODEKM)**.
- **Automatic Semantic Web Portal Generator (ODESeW)**.
- **Web Resource Annotation Tool (ODEAnnotate)**.
- **Semantic Web Service Tool (ODESWS)**.

The ontology editor provides services such as documentation, an OKBC-based Prolog Inference engine, and ODEClean. WebODE supports automatic export and import in XML format and offers translation services to other languages and systems, including RDF(S), OIL, DAML+OIL, OWL, and F-Logic. This enhances interoperability.

#### Interoperability and Export Services
WebODE's export services allow generating ontologies in various formats, including XML, RDF(S), OIL, DAML+OIL, OWL, and F-Logic. These ontologies can be transformed and used with the Protégé ontology editor or other tools. WebODE ontologies can be integrated into applications via its Java API, either locally or remotely using RMI and Web services (Gómez-Pérez et al., 2001).

#### Transformation to Java
When transforming ontologies into Java, concepts are converted into Java beans, attributes into class variables, and ad hoc relations into associations between classes. This Java code can be used to create other Java applications and can be uploaded into rule systems like Jess.

#### Multi-User Support
WebODE supports multiple users, allowing the creation of user groups for collaborative ontology editing. Synchronization mechanisms ensure that multiple users can edit the same ontology without conflicts. Access control can be managed to restrict or grant access to specific services based on user or group permissions.

#### pOWL
pOWL is a PHP-based, open-source ontology management tool that supports parsing, storing, querying, manipulation, versioning, serving, and serialization of RDFS and OWL knowledge bases in a collaborative web environment. It follows W3C Semantic Web Standards and supports various serialization formats such as RDF/XML and N-Triple. pOWL is designed to handle ontologies of arbitrary size, loading only the necessary parts into memory to optimize performance.

#### pOWL Architecture
pOWL's architecture consists of four tiers:
1. **pOWL Store**: Stores data in a relational database, including ontology information and history.
2. **RDFAPI, RDFSAPI, OWLAPI**: APIs for handling RDF, RDFS, and OWL, with extended methods for OWL properties and Description Logic axioms.
3. **pOWLAPI**: Provides classes and functions for building web applications on top of the existing APIs.
4. **User Interface**: Based on PHP pages, offering triple, database, and Description Logic axiom views of the knowledge base.

#### SWOOP
SWOOP is a web-based OWL ontology editor and browser that supports OWL validation, reasoning, and multiple ontology environments. Users can compare, edit, and merge ontologies, and search concepts across multiple ontologies using a keyword and DL-based search algorithm. SWOOP also supports collaborative annotation with the Annotea plug-in and maintains versioning information.

#### SWOOP Features
- **Collaborative Annotation**: Using the Annotea plug-in.
- **Versioning**: Mechanisms to maintain different versions of the same ontology.
- **Ontology Partitioning**: Automatic partitioning into distinct modules.
- **Debugging/Repair**: Identification of error-causing axioms and natural language explanations.
- **Visualization**: "CropCircles" format for class hierarchy visualization.
- **MVC Paradigm**: Based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, with a plug-in system for extensibility.

#### Conclusion
Several software tools are available for ontology development, supporting various activities from domain modeling to knowledge-base system building. These tools promote interoperability and support the use of external and in-house ontologies. Key tools include:
- **Protégé**: For domain modeling and knowledge-base systems, with extensions for visualization and project management.
- **OntoEdit**: For creating, browsing, maintaining, and managing ontologies, with support for collaborative development.
- **DOE**: For building ontologies according to the Bachimont methodology, with import and export capabilities.
- **IsaViz**: For browsing and authoring RDF models as graphs, with a user-friendly interface.
- **Ontolingua**: For collaborative editing and creation of ontologies, with comparison capabilities.

These tools provide a robust set of features and functionalities to meet the diverse needs of ontology development projects.
