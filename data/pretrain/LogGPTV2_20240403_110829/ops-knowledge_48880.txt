User: I am writing a module in Python which runs a C++ Program using subprocess module. Once I get the output from C++, I need to store the that in Python List . How do I do that ?
Assistant: one dirty method:
You can use Python to read (raw_input) from stdin (if there is not input, it will wait). the C++ program writes to stdout.
