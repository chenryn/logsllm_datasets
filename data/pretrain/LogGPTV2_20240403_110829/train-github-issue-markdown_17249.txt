I am using `withRouter` HoC as described in this snippet, however, I am still
getting the error:
     utils.js:26 Warning: the 'url' property is deprecated. https://err.sh/next.js/url-deprecated
  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Code executes without the deprecation warning.
## Current Behavior
The error mentioned above appears.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Import `withRouter` to your component
  2. Refer any field from `this.props.router`
  3. Export your component wrapped in `withRouter` HoC
  4. When component is rendered, the deprecation error appears in console
## Context
I am implementing Navigation component that is aware of the current route (to
highlight the NavItem).
