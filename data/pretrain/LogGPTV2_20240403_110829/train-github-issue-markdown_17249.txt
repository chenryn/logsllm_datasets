I am currently utilizing the `withRouter` Higher-Order Component (HoC) as illustrated in my code snippet. However, I continue to encounter the following deprecation warning:

```
utils.js:26 Warning: The 'url' property is deprecated. For more information, please visit: https://err.sh/next.js/url-deprecated
```

### Checklist
- [x] I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
The code should execute without displaying any deprecation warnings.

## Current Behavior
The aforementioned deprecation warning appears in the console.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Import `withRouter` into your component.
2. Access any field from `this.props.router`.
3. Export your component wrapped with the `withRouter` HoC.
4. Upon rendering the component, the deprecation warning is displayed in the console.

## Context
I am developing a Navigation component that needs to be aware of the current route in order to highlight the active `NavItem`.
