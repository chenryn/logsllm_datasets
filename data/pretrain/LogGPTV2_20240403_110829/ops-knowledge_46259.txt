User: I'm having some trouble installing open-cv
I've tried several approaches but only succeeded in installing open-cv by downloading the wheel file from a website which I don't remember and running this command in the command prompt: pip3 install opencv_python-3.2.0-cp35-cp35m-win32.whl;
I can now import cv2 ONLY if I'm on site-packages directory. If I get out of that folder (in CMD of course) I wont be able to import cv2 (getting a "no module found" message).
If i didnt expressed myself well, these are the commands I proceed to run to be able to import cv2 inside "site-packages" directory using CMD:

python
import cv2

If I try this in another directory, it doesn't work. The same if I create a .py file and try to import cv2
Assistant: You need to update your environment variables.

In search, go to the control panel
Click the Advanced system settings link.
Click Environment Variables. In the section System Variables, find the PYTHONPATH variable. 
Click edit, and add the absolute path to your Lib directory
