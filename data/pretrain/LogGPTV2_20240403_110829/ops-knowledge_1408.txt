User: Please describe the principles and preventive measures of SQL injection attacks.
Assistant: SQL injection attack refers to the way that the attacker injects malicious code into the SQL statement through specially crafted input content to achieve the attack. The principle is to use unfiltered or insufficiently filtered user input to bypass the program's legality verification by constructing specific SQL statements, so that the application program executes malicious SQL statements to achieve the purpose of illegally controlling or stealing database information. For example, an attacker can make the application think that the user has successfully logged in by filling in specific statements in the login background, thereby bypassing the login verification and illegally entering the background management interface. Operations such as data tampering and information leakage can also be performed through SQL injection attacks. In order to avoid SQL injection attacks, you can take the following preventive measures: 1. Input filtering: Strictly verify and filter the data entered by users to ensure that the user's input data is of a legal type and prevent injection code from being embedded. 2. Parameterized query: Use SQL statements in a parameterized manner, so that the input data can be filtered to prevent SQL statements from being used by attackers. 3. Minimize privileges: The user rights of the database should be minimized, and only the corresponding rights are granted for specific functions of the database. 4. Limit error messages: During database operations, you should limit error message prompts, and do not return specific error messages to users. 5. Exception handling: handle the exceptions that occur during SQL execution to prevent attackers from obtaining system information through error prompts. In addition, using a framework such as an ORM can simplify SQL operations, thereby avoiding the risk of errors in manually writing SQL statements.
