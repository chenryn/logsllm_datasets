Open a terminal on the local computer and use the following command to connect to the Linux server: ``` ssh username@public IP address``` where username is the username on the Linux server. 3. Enter the password to log in to the Linux server. 4. Use the following command in the terminal to upload the file to the server: ``` scp /local path/filename username@public IP address:/target path/ ``` Wherein, the local path is the path of the file on the local computer, and the file The name is the name of the file to be uploaded; the target path is the target path of the file on the server, and the username and public IP address are the same as above. 5. Use the following command in the terminal to download the file from the server: ``` scp username@public IP address:/server path/filename/local path/ ``` Wherein, the server path is the path of the file on the server, and the filename is the name of the file to be downloaded; the local path is the target path of the file on the local computer, and the username and public IP address are the same as above.
