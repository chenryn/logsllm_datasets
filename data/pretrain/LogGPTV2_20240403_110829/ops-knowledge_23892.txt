User: How to implement a more secure authentication method when logging in to the server remotely?
Assistant: 1. Using key authentication: By generating a public key and a private key, the private key is used for authentication when logging in to the server remotely, thereby avoiding the risk that the password may be stolen when using password authentication. 2. Use multi-factor authentication: In addition to password authentication, add another factor for authentication, such as ID card, mobile phone verification code, fingerprint, etc., to improve the security of authentication. 3. Use a separate authentication server: Put authentication-related operations in a separate server to reduce security risks. 4. Separate users with different permissions: put users with different permissions on different servers to avoid losses caused by user misuse or malicious attacks. 5. Enhance system security configuration: In addition to the above measures, it is also necessary to strengthen system security configuration, such as restricting remote login IP, enhancing password policy, disabling unnecessary services, etc.
