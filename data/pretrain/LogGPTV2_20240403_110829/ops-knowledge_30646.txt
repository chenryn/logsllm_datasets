User: How to protect sensitive information in the database?
Assistant: The following are several ways to protect sensitive information in the database: 1. Data encryption: Sensitive data is encrypted and stored in the database, and only authorized users can decrypt and access the data. 2. Access control: Only specific users or organizations are authorized to access sensitive data. For example, authentication using username and password, role-based access control, single sign-on, etc. are required. 3. Data backup and recovery: Regularly back up sensitive information in the database and use the backup to restore when needed. Make sure backup data is also protected by physical and logical access controls. 4. Security audit: Realize related monitoring and logging of database access, and conduct security audit to prevent unauthorized access and leakage of sensitive data. 5. Data masking: Use data masking technology to protect sensitive data. For example, display only some characters of sensitive data, or substitute values for sensitive data. 6. Security Training: Conduct regular security training to increase employee knowledge and awareness to ensure they follow security best practices when using the database.
