User: I installed pythonxy (2.7.9), but when I try to run ipython from windows powershell, I get an error "failed to create process." What steps can I take to solve this problem. 
Thanks,
Assistant: Go to cmd and type where iPython. if it results in two locations, delete one and proceed with other. Usually this happens when you have installed Anaconda distribution after installing python in your local system. Deleting python version locally would be a better solution. And then go to the root folder, (Ex: C:\Users\Desktop\new_folder), by holding shift, click right button and go to open command prompt here. Type iPython. This should solve your problem.
