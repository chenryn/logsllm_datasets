**Subject: Troubleshooting "Failed to Create Process" Error with IPython**

Dear [User],

Thank you for reaching out. I understand that you are encountering an error when trying to run IPython from Windows PowerShell after installing PythonXY (2.7.9). The error message you see, "failed to create process," often indicates a conflict between different Python installations on your system.

To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Check for Multiple IPython Installations:**
   - Open the Command Prompt (cmd).
   - Type `where ipython` and press Enter.
   - If the command returns multiple paths, it means you have more than one IPython installation. This can cause conflicts.

2. **Remove Conflicting Installation:**
   - If you have both a local Python installation and an Anaconda distribution, it's generally better to remove the local Python installation to avoid conflicts.
   - Uninstall the local PythonXY (2.7.9) from your system. You can do this through the "Add or Remove Programs" section in the Control Panel.

3. **Verify the Path:**
   - After uninstalling the conflicting Python version, ensure that the correct path to the remaining IPython installation is set.
   - Navigate to the root folder where you want to run IPython (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\new_folder`).
   - Right-click while holding the Shift key, and select "Open Command Prompt here."
   - Type `ipython` and press Enter. This should now launch IPython without any errors.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide additional details about your environment, and I will be happy to assist you further.
