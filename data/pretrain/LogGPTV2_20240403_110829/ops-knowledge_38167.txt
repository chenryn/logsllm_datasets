Assistant: This log chunk is related to the system's network and Bluetooth connections. It begins with an error message regarding AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService, followed by a BSSID change and a Bluetooth controller register service notification. Networkd and QQ then report various tasks, followed by locationd and GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent checking for updates. VoipWrapper then closes a video chat, followed by the system entering sleep mode and waking up. Bluetooth is then disabled, sharingd changes to discoverable mode off, and QQ reports a failed network route. UserEventAgent authenticates, wl0 sets up a keepalive, locationd changes the location icon state, and AppleThunderboltNHIType2 retries.
