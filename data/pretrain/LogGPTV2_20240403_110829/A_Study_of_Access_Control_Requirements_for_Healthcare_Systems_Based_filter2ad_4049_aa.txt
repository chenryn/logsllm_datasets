## Abstract
In healthcare, role-based access control (RBAC) systems are often extended with exception mechanisms to ensure access to necessary information even when the needs do not follow expected patterns. These exception mechanisms, while useful, increase the risk to patient privacy and should be limited and subject to auditing. This study examines access logs from a hospital's Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system that extensively uses exception-based access control. Our findings indicate that the use of these exception mechanisms is too frequent and widespread to be considered exceptions. The large volume of log data and the use of predefined or uninformative reasons for access make it infeasible to audit the log for misuse. However, the informative reasons provided offer starting points for requirements on how to meet usage needs without relying on exception-based access. With more structured and fine-grained logging, analysis of access logs could be a valuable tool for reducing the need for exception-based access.

## 1. Introduction
Security is a critical concern for healthcare systems, particularly those containing sensitive data like the Electronic Patient Record (EPR). Access control is at the heart of this concern. While healthcare personnel need timely access to the right information to provide the best possible care, it is equally important to ensure patient privacy.

Over recent years, there has been a shift in access control research towards more dynamic, workflow-based, and user-centered models. However, existing healthcare systems still predominantly use traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) models, where roles correspond to job functions and administration is centralized. These systems struggle to handle unplanned and dynamic events, such as patients being transferred between wards, doctors seeking second opinions, or unexpected patient arrivals. Consequently, most such systems include exception mechanisms to address these situations. These mechanisms, while convenient, introduce additional complexity and necessitate regular auditing to prevent misuse. 

Studying the use of these access control mechanisms—under what circumstances and to cover what needs—can inform better design of normal access control mechanisms, thereby minimizing the reliance on exception mechanisms. Additionally, it is crucial to investigate whether the audit logs contain the necessary information to trace any misuse of these exception mechanisms, or if they lack essential details.

This paper examines access logs from an installation of DocuLive EPR, a system widely used in many of the largest hospitals in Norway. We analyze data from all eight hospitals in the Central Norway Health Region (CNHR) to determine if the audit trails can uncover real user needs that will be helpful in designing better access control mechanisms for healthcare. We also assess whether the logs contain the information needed to detect misuse and explore the potential application of recent access control research principles to create more suitable access control mechanisms for healthcare systems.

## 2. Related Work
To our knowledge, no previous work has investigated audit trails from EPR systems to extract access control requirements for healthcare systems. However, some studies have explored eliciting access control requirements for healthcare systems through other means. For example, Evered and Bögeholz (2004) conducted a detailed case study on a small aged-care facility in Australia, highlighting the complexity of access control requirements even in a small setting. Beznosov (1998) discussed requirements for access control in the US healthcare domain, suggesting that it should be based on role, affiliation, location, time, and relationship, though the basis for these conclusions is not clearly stated. Anderson (1996) presented a general security policy model for clinical information systems, including access control, based on identified threats. Blobel (2004) described a set of models for authorization and access control in healthcare systems, drawing on his experience and involvement in international EPR architecture and security standards.

## 3. The Subject of Study
Norway is divided into five health regions: North, South, East, West, and Central. Each region has a regional health authority and several health enterprises, each encompassing one or more hospitals. In the Central Norway Health Region (CNHR), which is the focus of this study, there are four health enterprises and eight hospitals, all using DocuLive EPR. Norwegian laws prohibit the sharing of medical records between health enterprises, but medical information can be transferred upon specific request. As shown in Figure 1, there are separate installations of the EPR system for each hospital, managed by a common organization, CNHR IT, responsible for daily operation and maintenance.

The EPR system for each hospital is divided into three domains: somatic, psychiatry, and child and youth psychiatry. Information in the patient record is assigned to a domain, and users working in one domain do not have access to parts of a patient’s EPR in another domain. Access decisions in DocuLive are based on a user’s role, current place of work, and the type of information being accessed. Two exception mechanisms are available: actualization and emergency access. Actualization allows a user to open the EPR of a patient they do not have access to, with a reason and time interval recorded. Emergency access allows a user to open a single document in a patient’s EPR, with a stricter requirement for providing a reason and a fixed time interval.

## 4. Methods and Materials
We collected access log data from the EPR system from all eight hospitals in CNHR for one month (March 2006). There are two separate logs: the access log, which records every document opened, and the actualization and emergency log, which records the use of these mechanisms. The IT unit in CNHR created anonymized versions of the logs, removing names of users and patients and replacing them with unique indexes. We also collected an anonymized listing of users and their assigned access permissions.

### 4.1 Research Questions
After reviewing the available information, we constructed a set of research questions to guide our work:

- Q2: [Insert Question 2]
- Q3: [Insert Question 3]

These questions aim to collect information that will help uncover access control requirements for healthcare systems.
