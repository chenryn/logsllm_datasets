Abstract
In healthcare, role-based access control systems are of-
ten extended with exception mechanisms to ensure access to
needed information even when the needs don’t follow the ex-
pected patterns. Exception mechanisms increase the threats
to patient privacy, and therefore their use should be limited
and subject to auditing. We have studied access logs from a
hospital EPR system with extensive use of exception-based
access control. We found that the uses of the exception
mechanisms were too frequent and widespread to be consid-
ered exceptions. The huge size of the log and the use of pre-
deﬁned or uninformative reasons for access make it infeasi-
ble to audit the log for misuse. The informative reasons that
were given provided starting points for requirements on how
the usage needs should be accomplished without exception-
based access. With more structured and ﬁne-grained log-
ging, analysis of access logs could be a very useful tool for
learning how to reduce the need for exception-based access.

Introduction
Security is a key concern for healthcare systems that con-
tain sensitive data, like the Electronic Patient Record (EPR).
Access control is at the heart of this concern. While health-
care personnel need access to the right information at the
right time to provide the best possible care, it is also impor-
tant to ensure patient privacy.
Over the last few years, we have seen a development in
access control research towards more dynamic, workﬂow-
based and user-centered models [1]. However, the state
of the art in existing healthcare systems appears to be the
traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model [2],
where roles correspond to job functions and administra-
tion is centralized. These systems are not well-suited for
handling unplanned and dynamic events like patients be-
ing transferred between wards, doctors asking for second
opinions from colleagues or simply unplanned patient ar-
rivals. Consequently most such systems have exception
mechanisms in place in addition to the normal role-based
access control for handling these situations. Use of these
exception mechanisms typically triggers additional logging
of the user’s actions. Including these mechanisms makes
the systems much more convenient to use. However, from
a security viewpoint the use of exceptions leads to added
complexity and a need to perform regular auditing to en-
sure that the mechanism is not misused. With an excep-
tion mechanism in place that allows the users to override
the normal access control mechanism, technical measures
alone cannot ensure privacy and security. This increases the
need for manual control mechanisms and awareness train-
ing for users to limit the use of the exception mechanisms.
However, studying how these access control mechanisms
are used - in what situations, to cover what needs - may
teach us something about how normal access control mech-
anisms should be changed to better suit the needs of the
users, thereby eliminating or at least minimizing the use of
exception mechanisms. Also, it is interesting to investigate
if the audit logs contain the necessary information to trace
any misuse of such exception mechanisms, or if not - what
information is lacking.
In this paper we will examine access logs from an instal-
lation of DocuLive EPR1, a system with extensive use of
exception-based access control. Doculive EPR is used by
many of the largest hospitals in Norway. We have pulled
information from the access logs from all eight hospitals in
the Central Norway Health Region (CNHR). The aim of this
work is to investigate if the audit trails may uncover infor-
mation about the real user needs that will be helpful in de-
signing better access control mechanisms for healthcare and
also to examine if the logs contain the information needed

of the principles set forward in access control research in
recent years may be applied to create better-suited access
control mechanisms for healthcare systems.
2 Related work
To our knowledge there has been no previous work pub-
lished on investigating audit trails from EPR systems to
extract access control requirements for healthcare systems.
However some work has been done on eliciting access con-
trol requirements for healthcare systems by other means.
Evered and B¨ogeholz in 2004 published a paper [3] describ-
ing how they performed a detailed case study on a small
aged-care facility in Australia that at the time of study only
used paper-based records. The study illustrates that even for
such a small example, the access control requirements are
very complex. In a short (one page) paper from 1998 [4]
Beznosov discusses requirements for access control in the
US healthcare domain and states that it should be based on
role, afﬁliation, location, time and relationship. It is how-
ever not clear from the one-page paper what these conclu-
sions are based on. In a classic paper [5] from 1996 R. J.
Anderson presents a general security policy model for clini-
cal information systems, which includes access control. He
bases the motivation for this policy on a number of identi-
ﬁed threats towards healthcare systems. Based on his ex-
perience and involvement in international EPR architecture
and security standards, Blobel in 2004 [6] published a pa-
per describing a set of models for authorization and access
control in healthcare systems.
3 The subject of study
Norway is divided into ﬁve health regions: north, south,
east, west, and central. Each region has a regional health
authority and several health enterprises. Each health en-
terprise encompasses one or more hospitals, and together
the health enterprises in one region encompass all hospitals
within the region.
In the Central Norway Health Region
(CNHR), which was the object of this study, there are four
health enterprises and eight hospitals. All of these hospi-
tals use DocuLive EPR. Norwegian laws prohibit sharing
of medical records between health enterprises. Medical in-
formation may be transferred based on a speciﬁc request,
but not shared in real-time, e.g.
through a common EPR-
system. As Figure 1 shows there are therefore separate in-
stallations of the EPR-system for each hospital. However,
there is one common organization, CNHR IT, which is re-
sponsible for the daily operation and maintenance of the
EPR-systems for all hospitals in the region. Because they
all use the same EPR-system, DocuLive, it is possible to
extract and compare log data across hospitals.
Figure 1 also illustrates how the EPR system for one
hospital is divided into three domains: somatic, psychiatry
and child and youth psychiatry. Information in the patient
record is assigned to a domain. Domains are used to protect
information that is considered ”extra sensitive”. This means
that a user working on a ward in the somatic domain does
not have access to parts of a patient’s EPR that belong to
any of the other two domains - even if the patient currently
is at this user’s ward. Only users working in psychiatry or
child and youth psychiatry can access parts of the EPR that
are assigned to these domains.
In DocuLive access decisions are based on a user’s role
(e.g. doctor, nurse, secretary), current place of work (ward)
and the type of information being accessed. The role de-
termines which documents in the EPR a user is allowed to
access. At any given time a user has access permissions ac-
cording to his or her role for the patients that are currently
registered at the ward where he or she works. Note that a
user may be assigned to several roles and places of work. In
addition, there are two exception mechanisms for access:
• Actualization - allows a user to open the EPR of a pa-
tient that he/she does not have access to through the
normal access control mechanism. The user is granted
access to the EPR as though the patient was registered
at the ward where he/she works. The permission to
use the actualization mechanism is not part of a user’s
role, but is granted on an individual basis. When us-
ing actualization the user has to provide a reason for
doing so, and the action is recorded in a separate log
for use of actualization and emergency access. The
EPR is then opened for a speciﬁc time period, which
depends on the reason provided. In CNHR there are
currently eight predeﬁned reasons for using actualiza-
tion which are shown in Table 1 with corresponding
time intervals. There is also the option for entering
a self-deﬁned reason and time interval. Actualization
is also used as an automatic mechanism by the sys-
tem for opening EPRs for users who are assigned an
approval-task (signing) for documents in the EPR and
for opening the EPR of patients who are scheduled to
arrive at the hospital soon, but have not been admitted
yet. The time-period for automatic actualization is set
to 7 days.
• Emergency access - allows a user to open a single doc-
ument in a patient’s EPR that he/she does not have ac-
cess to through the normal access control mechanism.
The emergency mechanism is stricter than actualiza-
tion in that it has to be used on every single document
that the user wants to open. In CNHR only some of the
hospitals use emergency access - most make due with
only actualization. However - where in use - emer-
gency access is used to access EPR documents across

domains within one hospital. That is: some use it as a
way for users in the somatic domain to access informa-
tion in the psychiatry and child and youth psychiatry
domains. As for actualization, when using emergency
access control the user has to provide a reason and the
action is recorded in the same log as use of actualiza-
tion log. Note that there are no predeﬁned reasons for
using emergency access; the user always has to man-
ually provide a reason. Also note that the time inter-
val where the document remains accessible after using
emergency access is ﬁrm. In CNHR this time inter-
val is set to 10 hours. Not all documents in the EPR
are accessible through emergency access, only those
speciﬁcally labeled so, and only some users have the
permission to use emergency access. Emergency ac-
cess is assigned to users much in the same way as roles
- meaning that the permission to use emergency access
is linked to a ward or hospital.
4 Methods and materials
In this study we collected access log data from the EPR-
system from all eight hospitals in CNHR for one month
(March 2006). There are two separate logs:
• Access log - every time a document is opened an en-
try is created in the access log containing information
about the user, the patient and the document being ac-
cessed.
• Actualization and emergency log - an entry is created
in this log whenever an EPR is opened using actualiza-
tion or a document is opened using emergency access.
This record also contains information about the pro-
vided reason and time interval.
Note that it is only the action of actualization or emergency
access that is recorded in a separate log. Any subsequent
use of the EPR within the time interval is recorded in the
normal access log. Therefore we had to extract and combine
information from the two logs to get a complete view of
use of EPRs within an actualization or emergency access
period.
The IT-unit in CNHR was very helpful in creating
anonymized versions of the logs - removing names of users
and patients and replacing with anonymous, but unique in-
dexes. In addition to the log-extracts, we also collected an
anonymized listing of users in the region including their as-
signed access permissions. The log-extracts we received
consisted of:
• All records:
– Anonymous user ID
– Users’s place of work - hospital and ward
– Anonymous patient ID
– Patient location - hospital and ward
• Only in records from access log:
– Time stamp
– Document ID
– Document type
– Document code
• Only in records from actualization/emergency log:
