## Conference
2015 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2015)

## Abstract
This paper summarizes the First International Workshop on Model-Based Design for Cyber-Physical Systems (MB4CP 2015), held in conjunction with DSN 2015 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

## General Objectives and Approach
The primary objective of the workshop is to promote discussion and broaden the common ground on the application, adaptation, and design of model-based methods, specifically addressing the unique requirements of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). The emergence of CPSs has led to the integration of intelligence into many critical infrastructure domains, such as transportation, smart grids, and telecommunication networks. For instance, in smart grids, challenges include increasing complexity in the power grid, growing demand for electric power, support for renewable energy sources, and meeting requirements for enhanced, adaptive service quality. A cohesive framework is needed to integrate communication and information technologies into a complex real-time control network, supporting key properties like self-healing, availability, and responsiveness to variability in demand and supply.

The workshop aims to bring together members of the systems and software engineering communities to discuss challenges in modeling and model-based design of CPSs, share experiences, solutions, and tools, and address software engineering challenges. Participants will be able to share perspectives and present findings from research and practice relevant to cyber-physical systems and services. The goal is to better understand and identify the unique challenges and opportunities associated with modeling and analysis of CPSs, particularly in the context of large, complex, networked systems.

## Workshop Themes
In this inaugural workshop, we seek to guide the discussion towards methods for designing highly reliable and secure CPSs, especially those that balance the integration of modeling tools. The discussion will be structured around five broad themes:

1. **Designing Frameworks for Analytical Modeling and Simulation of CPSs:**
   - These frameworks can model designs and quantify system properties such as responsiveness and availability, using predictive (analytical, numerical, and simulated) and historical data.

2. **Applying Advanced Software Engineering Approaches:**
   - Techniques to analyze and improve the properties of cyber-physical applications, including model-driven development, self-managing and adaptive software systems, and sound reasoning and evaluation frameworks.

3. **Design and Analysis of Robust and Scalable Security and Privacy Frameworks:**
   - Methods to ensure the security and privacy of CPSs.

4. **Monitoring and Modeling System-Wide Attributes:**
   - Approaches to monitor and model attributes related to performance, reliability, and scalability.

5. **Lessons Learned and Experiences:**
   - Insights from the successful application of industry standards for CPSs to software systems.

## Keynote Speakers
To attract and engage industrial participants, we have invited two keynote speakers who will discuss best practices in computer systems modeling and analysis in the cyber-physical context and highlight engineering grand challenges from an industry perspective.

### Keynote 1: Andrea Bondavalli
- **Affiliation:** Università degli Studi di Firenze, Italy
- **Title:** Dependability Modeling and Analysis Methods Integrated in Industrial Architectural Frameworks in Model-Driven Engineering
- **Abstract:** In the past decade, model-driven engineering approaches have been extensively used for analyzing extra-functional properties of complex systems, such as safety, dependability, security, predictability, and quality of service. This talk explores these research directions and describes activities within the ARTEMIS-JU CHESS and CONCERTO projects, focusing on the lessons learned and experiences gained from applying CPS industry standards to software systems.

### Keynote 2: Paulo Esteves Veríssimo
- **Affiliation:** Université du Luxembourg, Luxembourg
- **Title:** Resilience of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems: The Devil is in the Models
- **Abstract:** Electrical utility infrastructures have become increasingly computerized, remotely controlled, and interconnected. This talk will challenge the audience with reflections on whether we are using the right models to represent, design, build, and analyze cyber-physical energy systems, especially considering their susceptibility to digital faults and cyber-attacks.

## Panel Discussion
The workshop will also feature a panel discussion on "The State of the Art on Model-Based Systems." Panelists include:
- Paulo Esteves Veríssimo, Université du Luxembourg, Luxembourg
- Andrea Bondavalli, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Italy
- Sahra Sedigh Sarvestani, Missouri University of Science & Technology, USA
- Alberto Avritzer, Siemens Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA

## Final Remarks and Conclusions
The MB4CP workshop aims to advocate the use of advanced modeling tools, methods, and techniques to deliver novel and cost-effective solutions for emerging cyber-physical systems. This domain is of paramount importance to a broad range of researchers, given the disruptive and extensive technology deployments anticipated over the next few decades.
