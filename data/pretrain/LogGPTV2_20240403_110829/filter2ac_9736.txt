Abstract—This  paper  provides  a  summary  of  the  First 
International  Workshop  on  Model  Based  Design  for  Cyber-
Physical Systems (MB4CP 2015) in conjunction with DSN 2015 
conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  
I.  GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF AND APPROACH TO THE 
WORKSHOP 
As described in the call for papers, the general objective 
of  the  workshop  is  to  promote  discussion  and  widen  the 
common  ground  on  application,  adaptation,  and  design  of 
model-based  methods;  as  a  response  to  the  particular 
requirements of cyber-physical systems (CPSs).  
into  many  critical 
The  emergence of  CPSs  has led  to  the  incorporation  of 
intelligence 
infrastructure  domains, 
including transportation, smart grids, and telecommunication 
networks. For example, in smart grids, the challenges to be 
addressed  include  increasing  complexity  in  the  power  grid, 
growth  in  the  demand  for  electric  power,  support  of 
renewable energy sources and fulfillment of requirements for 
enhanced, adaptive service quality. A framework is required 
to  enable  cohesive  integration  of  communication  and 
information  technologies  into  a  complex  real-time  control 
network comprising energy and information. This framework 
must  support  the  principal  properties  of  smart  grids, 
including  self-healing,  availability,  and  responsiveness  to 
variability in demand and supply.

This  workshop  seeks  to  bring  together  members  of  the 
systems, 
engineering 
communities  to  discuss challenges  in  modeling  and  model-
based  design  of  CPSs  and  to  share  experiences,  solutions, 
tools,  and 
to  software  engineering 
challenges.  Participants  will  be  able  to  share  perspectives 
and  present  findings  from  research  and  practice  relevant  to 
cyber-physical systems and services. The desired outcome is 
to better understand and identify the unique challenges posed 
by and opportunities associated with modeling and analysis 
of  CPSs,  especially  as  related  to  the  design  of  large, 
complex, networked systems.

To  attract  and  engage  industrial  participants,  we  have

best practices in computer systems modeling and analysis in 
the  cyber-physical  context,  and  will  highlight  engineering 
grand  challenges  as  envisioned

Abstract: In the last ten years, model-driven engineering 
approaches have been extensively used for the analysis of 
extra-functional  properties  of  complex  systems,  like 
safety, dependability, security, predictability, and quality 
of  service.  To  this  end,  engineering  languages  such  as 
UML  and  AADL  have  been  extended  with  additional 
features to model the required non-functional attributes, 
and  transformations  have  been  used  to  automatically 
generate the analysis models to be solved by appropriate 
analysis  tools.  In  this  talk,  we  explore  this  research 
direction  and  describe  our  activities,  presenting 
dependability modeling and analysis methods integrated 
in  industrial-driven  architectural  frameworks  for  the 
specification,  analysis,  and  verification  of  extra-
functional  properties  of 
systems, 
developed  within  the past ARTEMIS-JU  CHESS project 
and  currently  within  the  ARTEMIS-JU  CONCERTO 
project.  We  discuss  the  lessons  learned  and  experience 
gained  from  successful  application  of  cyber-physical 
systems industry standards in software systems.

Title: Resilience of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems: the 
devil is in the models 
Abstract:  Electrical  utility  infrastructures  have  become 
largely computerized, remotely/automatically controlled, 
and  interconnected,  amongst  each  other  and  with  other 
types of critical infrastuctures, and we are witnessing the 
explosion  of  new  paradigms:  distributed  generation, 
smart grids. In this accelerated mutation of power grids 
to cyber-physical systems, may it be that some things are 
“lost  in  translation”?  Are  we  using  the  right models  to 
represent,  design,  build  and  analyze  cyber  physical 
energy  systems?  Especially  when  what  used  to  be  an 
electrical  infrastructure  became  quite  susceptible  to 
computer-borne  problems  such  as  digital  accidental 
faults  and  malicious  cyber-attacks?  This 
talk  will 
challenge the audience with some reflections and points 
for discussion along these topics. 
In addition to the two keynotes, the workshop will include a 
panel  discussion  on  “The  State  of  the  Art  on  Model-based 
Systems”.  Panel

II.  FINAL REMARKS AND CONCLUSIONS 
In  closing,  the  goal  of  the  MB4CP  workshop  is  to 
advocate the use of advanced modeling tools, methods, and 
techniques  to  deliver  novel  and  cost  effective  solutions  for 
emerging  cyber-physical  systems.  We  believe  this  is  a 
domain  of  paramount  importance  to  a  broad  range  of 
researcher,  given  the  disruptive  and  extensive  technology 
deployments anticipated to occur over the next few decades.
