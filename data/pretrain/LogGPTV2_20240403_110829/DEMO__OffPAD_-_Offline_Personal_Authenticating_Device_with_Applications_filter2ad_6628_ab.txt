### Introduction to OﬀPAD and Initial Connection

The first connection to the OﬀPAD requires a Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU) mechanism, also known as "leap-of-faith." During the initial setup, there is no cryptographic method to verify the connection between the device and the client platform. The trust must be based on the physical observation of the setup.

### OﬀPAD Design Overview

A schematic view of the OﬀPAD design is illustrated in Figure 1.

**Figure 1: OﬀPAD v.1 Design Elements**

### Hardware Components

OﬀPAD integrates the following hardware components:
1. **Secure JavaCard/Global Platform Component**: For secure application execution and storage.
2. **e-Ink Screen (2.5 inches)**: For displaying information.
3. **Multi-color LED**: For simple information transmission.
4. **NFC Transceiver**: For near-field communication.
5. **Micro-USB Port**: For communication with the client.
6. **Fingerprint Sensor**: For biometric authentication.
7. **Flash Memory (4GB to 16GB)**: For data storage.

### Security Assumptions

We assume that the sensors integrated into the OﬀPAD are secure. However, OﬀPAD still relies on the host phone for additional sensors, such as the camera. Therefore, if the host phone is compromised by malware, it can potentially communicate false information to the OﬀPAD. Additionally, OﬀPAD uses the host phone for more resource-intensive computations, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). All inputs from the phone are considered untrusted in our scenarios.

### Firmware Features

The OﬀPAD firmware supports the following features:
- **User Authentication**: Biometric authentication of the user.
- **Certificate Management**: Managing certificates in OﬀPAD’s certificate store to check signatures, such as for authenticating service provider identities.
- **Signature Verification and Generation**: Using the OﬀPAD’s holder private key, which is unlocked after successful authentication.
- **Sensitive Information Display**: Showing sensitive information on the e-Ink display or multi-color LED.
- **Biometric Enrollment**: Enrolling users according to the specified biometric modality.

### OﬀPAD Demonstrators

The following applications of OﬀPAD are demonstrated:

#### Data-US
- **Description**: Authentication of user data by the service provider using OCR, alternatively displayed on the OﬀPAD e-Ink screen.
- **Purpose**: To authenticate user data through optical character recognition.

#### SU (Server Authentication by the User)
- **Description**: Server authentication by the user, based on petname systems managed by the OﬀPAD.
- **Purpose**: To provide a user-friendly way to authenticate servers using petnames.

#### US (User authenticated by the Service Provider)
- **Description**: User authentication by the service provider, based on an extended challenge-response protocol (XDAA) between the client terminal and OﬀPAD.
- **Purpose**: To ensure strong and secure user authentication.

#### Auto-login
- **Description**: Contextual automatic login/logout based on the indoor location of the OﬀPAD, using Sonitor’s system.
- **Purpose**: To automate the login process based on the user's location.

#### Multi-login
- **Description**: Automatic access to a resource conditioned on multiple users authenticated at once, using TellU Smarttracker system.
- **Purpose**: To enable simultaneous access for multiple authenticated users.

#### Strong Auth.
- **Description**: Strong authentication required for accessing sensitive information or tasks, using biometric fingerprint authentication by the OﬀPAD.
- **Purpose**: To provide a high level of security for sensitive operations.

### Use Case: Server Authentication by the User (SU)

To support cognitive server authentication, the server domain name received in the server certificate is mapped to a user-defined petname representing the service provider. The server certificate is also validated in the traditional way, providing syntactic server authentication.

**Figure 2: Server Authentication by the User Based on Petname Systems Managed with the OﬀPAD**

**Actions/Messages:**
1. **User initiates a secure TLS connection** through the client platform.
2. **Client platform contacts the server**.
3. **Server returns a server certificate** containing the public key.
4. **Server certificate is forwarded to OﬀPAD**.
5. **Server certificate is validated** (syntactic server authentication).
6. **Server certificate is mapped to a petname**.
7. **Petname is presented to the user**.
8. **User performs cognitive server authentication**.
9. **User approves server authentication**.
10. **TLS connection established** between the client and the server.

### Application in Hospitals

Hospitals are fast-paced environments where multiple users with diverse roles interact with shared IT systems. Ensuring patient information security and privacy is crucial, but frequent logins can be time-consuming and distracting. The OﬀPAD demonstrates continuous, context-aware, and usable authentication mechanisms to alleviate the burden of frequent logins. For example, a location-based authentication mechanism automatically logs users in when they approach a terminal and logs them out when they leave.

### Additional Applications

Various other applications can be imagined using OﬀPAD:
- **Medical Prescriptions**: Signing medical prescriptions using the same method as bank transactions.
- **Patient Record Management**: Allowing nurses to make changes to patient records under the supervision of a doctor.
- **Auto-login for Patient Transfer**: Facilitating the transfer of patients between rooms, with their preferred TV channels and other settings immediately transferred to the new terminal.
- **Petnames for Sensitive Services**: Associating petnames with domain names for sensitive services like tax offices and preferred shops, allowing users to perform cognitive authentication of these websites.

### Demonstration Setup

During the demo, a poster is used to describe the OﬀPAD graphically. The demo uses two laptops placed at least 2 meters apart, along with indoor location equipment from project partners TellU and Sonitor. A smartphone application, together with the OﬀPAD hardware phone cover, is also used. The demo utilizes the SmartTracker technology from TellU, which requires an Internet connection.
