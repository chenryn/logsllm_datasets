The ﬁrst connection to the OﬀPAD requires Trust-On-
First-Use (TOFU), also known as leap-of-faith. On ﬁrst use,
there is no cryptographic way to verify the connection be-
tween the device and the client platform, the trust must
simply be based on the physically observed set-up.
A schematic view of OﬀPAD design is illustrated in Fig.1.
Figure 1: OﬀPAD v.1 design elements
OﬀPAD integrates the following hardware components:
(i) secure Javacard/Global platform component for secure
application execution and storage, (ii) e-Ink screen 2.5 inches,
(iii) multi-color LED for simple information transmission,
(iv) NFC transceiver and (v) micro-USB for communica-
tion with the client, (vi) ﬁngerprint sensor, (vii) 4GB to
16GB ﬂash memory.
We assume that the sensors integrated in the OﬀPAD are
secure. OﬀPAD still makes use of the host phone for other
sensors, like camera, thus a malware on the phone can com-
municate false information to the OﬀPAD. OﬀPAD also asks
the host phone for the more heavy computations, e.g., for
OCR. However, all these inputs from the phone are consid-
ered in our scenarios as untrusted.
The OﬀPAD ﬁrmware supports the following features:
User Authentication by performing a biometric au-
thentication of the holder.
Manage certiﬁcates in OﬀPAD’s certiﬁcate store to check
signature, s.a. for authenticating service provider identities.
Sign and check signature using the OﬀPAD’s holder
private key unlocked after successful holder’s authentication.
Show sensitive information using the e-Ink display or
the multi-color LED.
Biometric user enrolment on the OﬀPAD according
to the speciﬁed biometric modality.
3. OFFPAD DEMONSTRATORS
The following applications of OﬀPAD are demonstrated.
Data-US: Authentication of user Data by the Service provider,
based on OCR (Optical Character Recognition), alter-
natively displayed on the OﬀPAD e-Ink screen.
SU: Server authentication by the User, based on petname
systems [2] managed by the OﬀPAD.
US: User authenticated by the service provider, based on
an extended challenge-response protocol XDAA [6] be-
tween the client terminal and OﬀPAD.
Auto-login: Contextual automatic login/oﬀ based on in-
door location of the OﬀPAD, using Sonitor’s system.
1848Multi-login: Automatic access to a resource conditioned
on multiple users authenticated at once, also using
TellU Smarttracker system.
Strong auth.: Strong authentication required for accessing
sensitive information or tasks, using biometric ﬁnger-
print authentication of the user by the OﬀPAD.
We demonstrate how the OﬀPAD enables mutual user-
server entity authentication as well as data authentication.
Each use case is illustrated with a ceremony [1] which is
simply a protocol where relevant actions by users and the
context environment are included. The intention of our so-
lutions is to support trusted interaction even in the presence
of malware infected client platforms. We illustrate here only
the ceremony SU and motivate Auto-login for hospitals.
In order to support cognitive server authentication, the
server domain name, received in the server certiﬁcate, is
mapped to a user-deﬁned petname representing the service
provider. The server certiﬁcate is also validated in the tradi-
tional way, which provides syntactic server authentication.

The actions/messages of the SU demonstrator are de-
scribed at a high-level as: (1) User initiates secure TLS con-
nection through client platform (2) Client platform contacts
server (3) Server returns server certiﬁcate containing public
key (4) Server certiﬁcate is forwarded to OﬀPAD (5) Server
certiﬁcate is validated (syntactic server authentication) (6)
Server certiﬁcate is mapped to petname (7) Petname is pre-
sented to user (8) User performs cognitive server authen-
tication (9) User approves server authentication (10) TLS

Hospitals are a hectic working environment where multi-
ple users with diverse roles interact with hospital IT shared
systems for various duties like patient records, routine infor-
mation, or logging of medical tasks. However, patient infor-
mation security and privacy must still be ensured through-
out the daily work. This implies that the staﬀ must log on
to terminals and be authorised every time they interact with
IT systems. This has been found very time consuming and
distracts attention from primary tasks. The inadequacy of
standard username/password process is due to the follow-
ing observations: (i) clinical work happens in a fast pace
while login causes focus shift; (ii) medical work is nomadic
and with constant interruptions while login is ﬁxed to one
computer; (iii) medical work is collaborative using shared
material while login is intended for single user activities.
The OﬀPAD demonstrators focus on continuous, context-
aware, and usable authentication mechanisms to relieve the
user from the burden of a frequent login/logoﬀ process. We
demonstrate a location-based authentication mechanism where
the user will be automatically logged in to a terminal when
she approaches the terminal, and logged oﬀ from it when
she leaves the terminal.
4. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION
Various applications can be imagined using OﬀPAD [8].
We mention here a few other than the six demonstrated.
The method for bank transaction can be used to sign medi-
cal prescriptions. The method for loading patient record can
be used in other situations, e.g., when a nurse is allowed to
make changes to a resource only under the supervision of a
doctor (maybe a specialist). Auto-login can be used for easy
moving of patients between rooms, where the entertaining
system, like preferred TV channels, are immediately trans-
ferred to the new terminal based on the location. Petnames
can be associated to any kinds of domain names for sensitive
services, like tax oﬃce, preferred shops, etc, and the user can
do cognitive authentication of these web-sites as well.
During the demo we also use a poster to describe the
OﬀPAD graphically. The demo uses two laptops which need
to sit at least 2 meters apart, along with indoor location
equipment from the project partners TellU and Sonitor. Be-
sides, the demo also uses a smart phone application, to-
gether with the OﬀPAD hardware phone cover attached to
the phone.3 The demo also uses the SmartTracker technol-
ogy from the project partner TellU, which runs in the servers
of TellU, therefore, Internet connection is needed.

does not have the proper dimensions. Unfortunately, the
version 2 of the cover, with proper form factor, will appear
only towards the end of the year.
