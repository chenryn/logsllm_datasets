User: I often find a need to put paths in my code in order to find data or in some cases tool-specific modules.  I've so far always used autotools because of this--it's just so easy to call sed to replace a few strings at build time.  However, I'd like to find a more Pythonic way of doing this, i.e. use distutils or some other blessed way of building/installing.  I've never managed to find anything relating to this in distutils documentation though so how do other people solve this problem?
Assistant: "I often find a need to put paths in my code"  -- this isn't very Pythonic to begin with.
Ideally, your code lives in some place like site-packages and that's the end of that.
Often, we have an installed "application" that uses a fairly fixed set of directories for working files.  In linux, we get this information from environment variables and configuration files owned by the specific userid that's running the application.
I don't think that you should be putting paths in your code.  I think there's a better way.
[I just wrote our app installation tool, which does create all the config files for a fairly complex app. I used the Mako templates tool to generate all four files from templates.]
