I searched already several times but I cannot find out how to deactivate
multiple cursors or how to change/deactivate the key binding. Finally, I open
the issue here.
If there is an option for this, how could I possibly find it; or rather, how
can I find and search available configuration options in my version of the
editor?  
The compiled coffeescript may make it hard to find options by using `grep`.
