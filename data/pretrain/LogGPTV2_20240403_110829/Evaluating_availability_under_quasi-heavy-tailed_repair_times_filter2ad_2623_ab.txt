201.5 minutes, 142.0 minutes, and 493.8 minutes for each
system, respectively, the repair times of the other 25% of
the incidents vary widely. The median for the in-house sys(cid:173)
tem is slightly smaller than that of the LANL HPC system,
whereas the third quartile for the in-house system is larger.
Thus we expect that the tail distribution of the in-house sys(cid:173)
tem decays more slowly than the LANL HPC system. The
value of the first quartile, median and the third quartile for
the NERSC Seaborg system are larger than those for the in(cid:173)
house system and LANL HPC system. This means that a
relatively small number of incidents are repaired in a short
time for the NERSC Seaborg system.
There was one incident that was repaired within one
minute, so that the minimum repair time of the in-house
system equals 0.0. An example of an incident that requires
short repair times is a case when a system reboots automat(cid:173)
ically. Another example is when false alerts are displayed.
We classified the reboot as a real incident whereas false alert
was not.

2.2.2 The shape of the distributions
In Figure 1, we plot the tail distributions of repair times,
Fe (x), which is the fractions of the repair times that exceed
X, on a log-log scale. We find that Fe(x) does not appear
to decay exponentially as X becomes larger for the range of
observed repair times. We see the tail distribution of the in(cid:173)
house system decays slowly compared with the other sys(cid:173)
tems, as was pointed out in the previous section.
Note that, since only a finite number of repair times
are observed, we cannot determine whether the distribution
obeys the power law distribution or obeys other distribu(cid:173)
tions such as the log-normal distribution. As will be dis(cid:173)
cussed in the next subsection, in our study, it does not mat(cid:173)
ter whether or not the distribution follows the power law
distribution in assessing the availability of an IT system in
a given period.
2.3 Quasi-heavy-tailed Distribution
A well-known statistical property of the heavy-tailed
power law distribution,
(1)
is that the first q moments are infinite if q - 1  a
unknown and the number N, of samples, can we determine
whether or not the time series data ofsample mean {(xq) j
:
j = 1, ... , N} shows suddenjumps? Note that the distribu(cid:173)
tion needs to be heavy-tailed for {(X q
: j = 1, ... , N} to
) j
show jumps for any N, but does not have to be heavy-tailed
for a given N.
To answer this question, we now define a new class of
probability distributions named the quasi-heavy-tailed dis(cid:173)
tribution (QHTD) with parameter (n,N) consisting ofthose
distributions which meet the following two conditions:
1. The gradient of the cumulative distribution function in
a log-log plot, d log Fe (x)I d log x monotonically de(cid:173)
creases,
2. Let h be the x-axis value at which the gradient of
the cumulative distribution function in a log-log plot,
dlogFe(x)ldlogxlx=h becomes less than -n. Then
the value Fe (h) is smaller than 1IN.
The definition of QHTD relies neither on the tail distribu(cid:173)
tion beyond the cutoff nor on the exact shape of the dis(cid:173)
tribution below the cutoff. The definition is based only on
the monotonic decrease of the gradient and the point where
the gradient becomes less than -n. We will argue that the
sufficient conditions for a probability distribution function
to show representative properties of the heavy-tailed power
law distribution with parameter n in a given time scale with
N samples is that the distribution belongs the QHTD.
Here is a simple explanation to show that these two
conditions are sufficient for the time series graph to show
jumps. Let us consider cumulative distribution functions
Fsol (x) and Fdot (x) whose profiles are represented as the
solid line and the dotted line in the Figure 2. Note that
Fsol (x) ~ Fdot(x) for x :::; XI/N and Fsol (x) = Fdot(x)
for x > Xl/No For both Fsol and Fdot' a large value
(x > XI/N) is generated once in N samples in expectation.
Since Fsol ~ Fdot for x :::; XI/N, the sample mean of the
small value events (x :::; XI/N) is smaller for the solid dis(cid:173)
tribution. Therefore the large value is more likely to show
a jump for the solid distribution. This suggests that if the
dotted line distribution shows the representative property of
heavy-tailed power law distribution, the solid line distribu(cid:173)
tion also shows this property. Below, without loss of gener(cid:173)
ality, we assume that () = 1 and n = 1 so that XI/N = N.
The probability of realizing events whose repair time takes
between a and b (a  O} and ibn} such that
Pr{(Mn - bn)/an :::; x} == Fn(anx + bn)
as n ~ 00,
(3)
where G(x) is a non-degenerate distribution function, then
G is a member of the Generalized Extreme Value Distribu(cid:173)
tion (GEV) family given by
~ G(x)
GE(X)=exp {- [l+~(X~JL)rl/E}. (4)
