### 2.2.1 Analysis of Repair Time Distributions

The repair times for the in-house system, LANL HPC system, and NERSC Seaborg system are 201.5 minutes, 142.0 minutes, and 493.8 minutes, respectively. The repair times for the remaining 25% of incidents exhibit significant variability. The median repair time for the in-house system is slightly lower than that of the LANL HPC system, but its third quartile is higher. This suggests that the tail distribution of the in-house system decays more slowly compared to the LANL HPC system. For the NERSC Seaborg system, the first quartile, median, and third quartile values are all higher than those for the in-house and LANL HPC systems, indicating that a relatively small number of incidents are resolved quickly.

One incident in the in-house system was repaired within one minute, resulting in a minimum repair time of 0.0 minutes. Examples of incidents with short repair times include automatic system reboots and false alerts. In our classification, an automatic reboot is considered a real incident, while a false alert is not.

### 2.2.2 Shape of the Distributions

In Figure 1, we plot the tail distributions of repair times, \( F_e(x) \), which represent the fraction of repair times exceeding \( x \), on a log-log scale. We observe that \( F_e(x) \) does not decay exponentially as \( x \) increases within the observed range of repair times. As noted in the previous section, the tail distribution of the in-house system decays more slowly compared to the other systems.

It is important to note that, given the finite number of observed repair times, we cannot definitively determine whether the distribution follows a power law or another distribution such as the log-normal. However, as discussed in the next subsection, this distinction is not critical for assessing the availability of an IT system over a given period.

### 2.3 Quasi-Heavy-Tailed Distribution

A well-known statistical property of heavy-tailed power law distributions is that the first \( q \) moments are infinite if \( q - 1 > \alpha \). Given an unknown parameter \( \alpha \) and a known number of samples \( N \), can we determine whether the time series data of sample means \(\{ (x^q)_j : j = 1, \ldots, N \}\) shows sudden jumps? Note that the distribution must be heavy-tailed for \(\{ (x^q)_j : j = 1, \ldots, N \}\) to show jumps for any \( N \), but it does not need to be heavy-tailed for a specific \( N \).

To address this question, we define a new class of probability distributions called the quasi-heavy-tailed distribution (QHTD) with parameters \((n, N)\). A distribution belongs to QHTD if it meets the following conditions:

1. The gradient of the cumulative distribution function in a log-log plot, \( \frac{d \log F_e(x)}{d \log x} \), monotonically decreases.
2. Let \( h \) be the value on the x-axis where the gradient of the cumulative distribution function in a log-log plot, \( \frac{d \log F_e(x)}{d \log x} \bigg|_{x=h} \), becomes less than \(-n\). Then, the value \( F_e(h) \) is smaller than \( \frac{1}{N} \).

The definition of QHTD does not depend on the tail distribution beyond the cutoff or the exact shape below the cutoff. It is based solely on the monotonic decrease of the gradient and the point where the gradient becomes less than \(-n\). We argue that the sufficient conditions for a probability distribution to exhibit representative properties of a heavy-tailed power law distribution with parameter \( n \) in a given time scale with \( N \) samples are that the distribution belongs to QHTD.

Here is a simple explanation to show that these two conditions are sufficient for the time series graph to show jumps. Consider cumulative distribution functions \( F_{\text{sol}}(x) \) and \( F_{\text{dot}}(x) \) represented by the solid and dotted lines in Figure 2. Note that \( F_{\text{sol}}(x) \leq F_{\text{dot}}(x) \) for \( x \leq \frac{x_1}{N} \) and \( F_{\text{sol}}(x) = F_{\text{dot}}(x) \) for \( x > \frac{x_1}{N} \). For both \( F_{\text{sol}} \) and \( F_{\text{dot}} \), a large value (\( x > \frac{x_1}{N} \)) is generated once in \( N \) samples in expectation. Since \( F_{\text{sol}} \leq F_{\text{dot}} \) for \( x \leq \frac{x_1}{N} \), the sample mean of the small value events (\( x \leq \frac{x_1}{N} \)) is smaller for the solid distribution. Therefore, the large value is more likely to show a jump for the solid distribution. This suggests that if the dotted line distribution shows the representative property of a heavy-tailed power law distribution, the solid line distribution also shows this property. Without loss of generality, we assume that \( \theta = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \) so that \( \frac{x_1}{N} = N \).

### 2.4 Generalized Extreme Value Distribution

If there exist sequences \(\{a_n\}\) and \(\{b_n\}\) such that
\[
\Pr\left\{\frac{M_n - b_n}{a_n} \leq x\right\} = F_n(a_n x + b_n)
\]
as \( n \to \infty \), where \( G(x) \) is a non-degenerate distribution function, then \( G \) is a member of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) family given by
\[
G(x) = \exp\left\{-\left[1 + \xi \left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)\right]^{-1/\xi}\right\}.
\]
