 PDF
PDF stands for Portable Document Format, the most widely used document file format 
online, originally created by Adobe Systems. Acrobat Reader, which is available as a 
free download from the Adobe website (https://get.adobe.com/reader), allows you 
to view and print PDF files. The PDF file format has become the most widely used file 
format by governments, corporations, and educational institutions around the world.

Let’s begin our search for documents by using some Google operators to find files on 
different cloud storage providers.
To search a Google doc site, use the following query in the Google basic search 
engine: site:docs.google.com SEARCHTERM. This will search for the specified search 
term on the Google document website (docs.google.com). In the same way, you can 
search for documents hosted on Google Drive—with public access—using the following 
search query: site:drive.google.com SEARCHTERM.
To search for files hosted on Dropbox, type the following in Google: site:dl.dropbox.
com SEARCHTERM.
To search for files on Amazon AWS, type the following in Google: site:s3.
amazonaws.com SEARCHTERM.
To search for files on Microsoft OneDrive, type the following in Google: 
site:onedrive.live.com SEARCHTERM.
 File Search Engines
Some specialized search engines can query many file hosting sites.
Fagan Finder
Fagan Finder (www.faganfinder.com/filetype) is an old search engine but still works 
just fine to locate different file types online. Just enter your search term, select the file 
type you want to search for, and finally select the search engine to conduct your search 
(see Figure 4-22).
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS

General-Search
General-Search (www.general-search.com) allows you to search for different file types 
using 11 file-hosting websites. You can select the file type and set a filter to its size (see 
Figure 4-23).
ShareDir
ShareDir (https://sharedir.com) lets you specify a file type and search more than 60 
file-hosting sites simultaneously. The unique service offered by this site is that it allows 
you to download 500MB daily—without waiting—from premium file-hosting websites. 
All you need is to register for a free account to use this feature.

Note! You can search any file-hosting website using the google site search 
operator. For example, to search for files on Mediafire.com, type the following 
operator into the google search engine: site:mediafire.com SEARCHTERM.
 Custom Search Engine
We already covered different types of search engines. However, we deferred our 
discussion of custom search engines until now, so we could cover how to use this 
technique to narrow down your search for specific file types within a limited set of sites.
The term custom search can be misleading at first sight; some users may think that 
they can create a new custom search engine according to their preferences. However, 
this is not true. A custom search allows you to use an existing search engine service to 
preselect the websites you need to limit your search to, the types of results returned (for 
example, only PDF files), and how the results will be prioritized.
A major provider of custom search is Google, so we will cover how to create one in 
the following steps:
 1. Go to www.google.com/coop/cse.
 2. You must have a Google account to use this service, so sign in if 
you have not done this already.
 3. Click the “New search engine” button on the left side.
 4. On the following page, enter the sites that you want to include in 
your search in the “Sites to search” section. You can include whole 
site URLs or individual page URLs. Select the language used to 
display the GUI of your custom search engine; finally, give your 
search a name.

 6. After successfully creating your custom search engine, Google 
will display a page showing the public URL of your custom search 
engine. It will also show the HTML code snippet in case you want 
to put it on your website and a link to a custom search engine 
control panel to update its settings (see Figure 4-25).
To access the public URL of your custom search engine, go to https://cse.google.
com/cse/all, click the custom search engine name you want to access, go to Setup, and 
select Public URL (see Figure 4-26).

Google will display a search box to you. Enter your search query, and Google will 
display relevant results from only the websites that have been entered upon creating 
your custom search engine.

Many Internet users have already created their own Google custom search engines to 
locate files and FTP directories online. One of these is located at https://cse.google.
com/cse/home?cx=014863114814409449623%3Ajc-vjhl_c5g. To use this custom search, 
enter your search term (file or directory name); you can also specify the file type you 
want to restrict search results to by clicking the relevant name below the search box  
(see Figure 4-27).
Other useful Google custom search engines for locating OSINT resources online are 
as follows:

 Gray Literature
As we already said in Chapter 1, gray literature is any material produced by the world’s 
commercial publishing systems. It has mainly two types.
• 
Gray literature
• 
Gray information
Gray literature includes books, journals, magazines, and anything that can be 
obtained publicly through traditional bookstore channels or academic publications.  
A user usually pays subscription fees to gain access to such resources or buys them 
directly from bookstores (such as buying books from Amazon.com). Springer  
(https://rd.springer.com), which provides access to millions of scientific documents 
such as journals, books, series, protocols, and reference works, is a clear example of a 
gray literature channel.
Gray information, on the other hand, cannot be obtained easily using traditional 
bookstore routes. However, it has some specialized channels where you can obtain some 
of it; you need to pay for specialized subscription agencies to acquire the rest. Gray 
information includes the following—and more:
• 
Academic papers
• 
Preprints
• 
Proceedings
• 
Conference and discussion papers
• 
Research reports
• 
Marketing reports
• 
Technical specifications and standards
• 
Dissertations
• 
Theses
• 
Trade publications
• 
Memoranda
• 
Government reports and documents not published commercially
• 
Translations

 Data Leak Information
Data leaks—sometimes called data breaches—are the intentional or unintentional 
release of confidential information to the public. Leaks mainly occur because of black 
hat hacker attacks against computerized systems or by disgruntled employees who may 
uncover secret information about their organizations.
Data leaks can include credit card information, PII, health information of patients, 
financial information, e-mail/social site usernames and passwords, trade secrets, 
corporations plans and future works, intellectual property information, and military 
information belonging to governments.
There is a debate on the legal status of data leak information. For instance, some 
argue that leaked information has become part of OSINT sources and thus you can 
handle it as you do with any publicly available information. The opposite opinion 
suggests that leaked information has been obtained illegally by breaching system or legal 
rules and thus should not be used as OSINT sources.
OSINT investigations cannot omit the existence of such leaked data while 
investigating some cases (especially when dealing with leaked intelligence information). 
However, it is preferred to handle it carefully on a case-by-case basis. For instance, if 
personal information or a private corporation has secrets leaked online, it is preferable 
not to publicize the information again and to renounce it in your search. Instead, you 
can use the useful elements in your investigation while respecting the affected actor’s 
private information that has been already leaked once.
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
183
Leaked information such as personal, financial, and corporate information can be 
found on the darknet (already covered in Chapter 3), but we are not going to cover it 
because this is made up of illegal sites promoting illegal actions.
Leaked official documents are distributed online using specific websites that 
focus on different areas, mostly the military, intelligence, and surveillance arenas. The 
following are the two most popular official data leak repositories online:
• 
WikiLeaks (https://wikileaks.org)
• 
Cryptome (https://cryptome.org)
• 
Offshore Leaks (https://offshoreleaks.icij.org)
 Document Metadata
We already talked about digital file metadata and demonstrated how to view/edit it using 
different tools in Chapter 2, but bear in mind that any digital files acquired online can 
contain useful metadata that must be investigated.
 Image
Digital images, logos, and icons can be of great value in OSINT investigations. Major 
search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing provide basic image search engine 
functionality. However, there are other more specialized image search engines that can 
be used to get more precise results.
 Basic Image Search
The following sites offer image search services:
• 
Google Image Search (https://images.google.com)
• 
Bing image search (www.bing.com/images)
• 
Yahoo Images (http://images.yahoo.com)
• 
Yandex (https://yandex.com/images)
