User: am trying to develop a e-commerce plateforme using python and nosql, as framework i'm between two: tornado and flask; so my question is simple:
Which one is suited for e-commerce: WSGI-like application (using Flask) or a non-blocking application (using Tornado)? 
NB: the e-commerce will manage products, and users (without making chat system) but will include a notification system (like facebook one: someone -a friend- sold somthing...), so which is better for such situation?
Assistant: Not an answer but as an alternative way django with satchmo is very suitable for that sort of projects.
