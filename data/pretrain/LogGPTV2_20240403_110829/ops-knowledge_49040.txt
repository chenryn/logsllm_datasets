User: I  pushed my Docker image to my Bluemix registry; I ran the container on Bluemix just fine; I have also set up a skeleton OpenWhisk rule which triggers a sample Python action but wish to trigger the image in my Bluemix registry as the action.  
But, as far as I  can see from the OpenWhisk documents, it is only possible to trigger Docker actions hosted on Docker Hub. (Per the wsk idk install docker skeleton).
Can OpenWhisk trigger Docker actions in my Bluemix registry?
Assistant: This is not currently possible. 
OpenWhisk can only create Actions from Docker images stored in the external Docker Hub registry.
