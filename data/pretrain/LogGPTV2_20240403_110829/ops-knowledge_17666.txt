User: I am writing a dev ops kind of a bash script that is used for running an application in a local development environment under configuration as similar to production as possible.  To eliminate duplicating some code/data which is already in a Python script, I would like my bash script to invoke a Python call to retrieve data that is hard coded in that Python script.  The data structure in Python is a dict but I really only care about the keys so I can just return an array of keys.  The Python script is used in production and I want to use it and not duplicate the data in my shell script to avoid having to follow on any modification in the production script with parallel changes in the local environment shell script.
Is there any way I can invoke a Python function from bash and retrieve this collection of values?  If not, should I just have the Python function print to STDOUT and have the shell script parse the result?
Assistant: Yes, that is best and almost only way to pass data from python to bash.
Also your function can write to file, which would be read by bash script.
