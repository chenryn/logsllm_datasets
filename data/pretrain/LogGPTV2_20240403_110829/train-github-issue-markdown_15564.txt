Hi,
Since the children of a form are stored in an `array()` in the `FormBuilder`,
the order of fields when rendering of a form in the view **using
only`form_widget(form)`** is determined by the way you added your fields in
your `FormType`.
    add('field1', 'text')
            ->add('field2', 'text');
        // and so on...
    }
**The problem is :** when using an `EventSubscriber` (like `preSetData`) in
order to add or some fields in your form, you cannot choose where you want to
add these fields.
    getData();
        $form = $event->getForm();
        if (null !== $data) {
            $form
                ->add($this->factory->createNamed('field3', 'text'))
                ->add($this->factory->createNamed('field4', 'text'));
            // and so on
        }
    }
This example will render the form in this order :
  * field3
  * field4
  * field1
  * field2
In my case it's really annoying because I can't modify the view. The redering
of my forms is generic and done **only using`form_widget(form)`**.
So, is there any way to specify the order of the fields when using an
`EventSubscriber` ?
