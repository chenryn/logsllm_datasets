**Current behavior**  
When a route with a specified outlet has children, the activated child is put
into the main router outlet, along side the route component that is already
active inside this outlet, rather than in the named outlet.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
Routes whose (componentless) parents have a specified outlet, should go into
said outlet.
**Reproduction of the problem**
The relevant route:
      {
        path: 'session',
        outlet: 'dialog',
        children: [
          {
            path: 'login',
            component: LoginComponent,
          },
          {
            path: 'register',
            component: RegisterComponent,
          }
        ]
      }

Click the three different links and you can see the login and register routes
are put into the main outlet alongside the already activated home route,
whereas the confirmation route is correctly placed in the named outlet.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I believe this to be a bug and the use case is demonstrated in the plunkr
