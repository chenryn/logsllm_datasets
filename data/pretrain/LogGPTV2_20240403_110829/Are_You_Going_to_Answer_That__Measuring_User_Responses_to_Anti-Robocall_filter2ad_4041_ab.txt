A. Methodology
Focus groups and interviews were conducted using semi-
structured questioning in a 60-minute conversation.2 Each
participant was asked to recall their experiences with spam
2Although we only wanted to hold focus groups, scheduling conﬂicts led
to the interviews. We decided to hold interviews to make sure that everyone
had an opportunity to participate regardless of their personal circumstance.

calls, advise on how to handle spam calls and discuss the
features and abilities of an app they would use to handle spam
calls. In addition, they were asked to provide their opinion on
ﬁve of the 54 available warnings and notice design probes,
examples of which are shown in Figure 4.3 For the context
of this study, we used the phrase “spam call” interchangeably
with “robocall” to refer to all types of unwanted calls. Subjects
were recruited using an online research administration system
at a University. Our protocol was approved by the local
Institutional Review Board. Some participants were volunteers
and others received extra credit for their participation. Our
study was one of many extra credit opportunities offered to
those who participated for extra credit.
After each focus group and interview, the resulting audio
recording was transcribed. Then, open coding was performed

If the ﬁrst six to nine digits of the number match
your own, it is likely a spam call and you should not
answer.
B. Participants
A total of 18 people participated in either a focus group or
an interview, similar to the number of participants in analogous
studies on diabetes [33], Tor browser [34], and password
storage [35]. A total of six focus groups (15 people) and
three interviews (3 people) were conducted. Participants were
between the ages of 21 and 32 (¯x = 23.056, σx = 2.859).
Most (13 participants) of the participants were male, and the
remaining were female. The participants identiﬁed themselves
as being a part of ﬁve ethnic groups: African American (2
participants), Caucasian (4 participants), Latino/Hispanic (5
participants), South Asian (3 participants), and East Asian
(4 participants). Eight participants currently use their phone
provider’s app service to manage spam calls or third-party
apps, and the remaining participants use other mechanisms
(e.g., blocking or ignoring unknown calls).
C. Results
As previously mentioned in Section 4.1, the focus group
participants discussed how they handled spam calls and
warning design needs. The resulting responses have been
categorized and are used to answer our research questions in
the following subsections.
1) RQ1: How do users determine if they will accept a
phone call?: All of the participants mentioned that they look
at the Caller ID, area code, and the time to determine if they
will accept a call. They use Caller ID to determine if the call
is from a known or unknown number. They use the area code
to determine if the call is from a location they would expect
to receive a call from. Participant T06 said, “If it’s a number
from my hometown, I never take it because my family doesn’t
live there anymore.” They looked at the time to see if they had
time available to talk or to see if it matched the time in which
they were expecting a call. If busy, they were more likely to
ignore a call from an unknown number. Also, they refer to their
personal call expectations to determine if they are expecting a
call from an unknown number during that time in their life. As
many participants mentioned, they are more likely to answer
a call from an unknown number if actively on the job market.
2) RQ2: How do users detect and stop spam calls?:
Participants were asked to advise on how to detect and stop
incoming spam calls, and the majority of them reference using
Caller ID in some capacity. The full list of responses can be
found in Appendix A. The top ﬁve responses to this question
(in order of frequency) are as follows:
1)
2)
3)
Look at the area code and determine if the call is
coming from an area in which you would expect to
receive a call at that time.
Block the number of a known spam caller.
Do not answer calls from an unrecognizable number,
but you should check to see if the caller left a
voicemail.
3) RQ3: What are users’ notiﬁcation preferences? How
do they receive and react to various visual cues?: Answers
to this question were gathered by showing a random set of
ﬁve designs from the 54 total call notiﬁcation designs in
Appendix E. These were inspired by designs seen in anti-
robocall apps and the idea of Authenticated Caller ID. Each
group saw a different set of notiﬁcations, but their responses
were similar and resulted in three takeaways.
1)
2)
3)
Background Color: A background color is more
noticeable when it differs from the original incom-
ing call screen and ﬁlls the entire screen. Although
participants noticed the color when it only ﬁlled
a portion of the screen,
they stated that when a
color ﬁlls the entire screen the warning was more
noticeable. However, a full red screen was noticeable
but undesirable. In reference to Figure 4a, participant
T08 said, “looks like I have a virus on my phone.
If I saw this I would uninstall the app immediately.”
The other participants in T08’s focus group and other
groups agreed that the color was too alarming. When
participants described their ideal app, they mentioned
seeing the color green or blue for authenticated calls
and red, black, yellow, gray, or orange for spam calls.
Although the red background color was undesirable,
participants still suggested the use of that color for
the background or icons used within their ideal app.
Icons: The check and “X” mark conveyed the same
message to all participants that saw those symbols.
The use of the locks confused participants. Participant
T05 stated “the open and closed lock both mean
secure to me”. Because locks convey a mixed mes-
saged in this context, they should not be used for this
purpose. This is not surprising since browser warning
researchers have also come to this conclusion [31],
[32], [7]. The designs that used emojis (emotionally
expressive faces) were rejected immediately by the
participants that saw them. Although they were able
to come to similar conclusions on the meaning of
the emojis, they did not believe those symbols were
serious enough for indicating call type. Participant
T17 stated, “Seeing a sad face makes me think it’s
saying the [call] signal itself is bad.” In addition,
when a few participants saw a sad face, thumbs down,
or the international prohibition sign along with the
word “Mom”, they interpreted it to mean that their
relationship with their mom was not good so they
should not answer that call.
Caller ID: Participants trust Caller ID and want
authenticated Caller ID. When asked if they would
answer a call that the app declared as spam but the
Caller ID declared “Mom” is calling (Figure 4a),
many participants chose to answer the call. Some said
they would be willing to take the chance but would
more than likely not answer if the app’s warning
was always correct
in the past. Seventeen of the
5
eighteen participants saw the notiﬁcation warning
them that the call from “Mom” was possibly spam.
Of those, nine participants said they would take that
call. Participant T06 even said, “I mean it’s my mom.
I’ll always take her call.”
4) RQ4: What characteristics and features would compel
users to download an anti-spam call app?: During the
focus groups, participants were asked to express how a spam
management app would look and behave if they used one
through writing, illustration or both. The participant responses
were sorted into six categories: call blocking, call log, number
database, app design, call options, and pre- and post-spam
needs.
Call Blocking: Fifteen participants wanted the ability to
select which numbers to block automatically, either during
app installation or after receiving certain calls. Participants
addressed the need to be able to have some calls blocked
automatically, such as calls from out of state numbers, and
then block some calls individually, e.g., those from someone
they would no longer wish to receive calls from.
Incoming Calls: Ten participants discussed the handling of
incoming calls. During one focus group, the participants all
agreed that one way to handle spam calls was to simply
let the phone ring. However, some participants complained
about being unable to use their phones while waiting. All
participants in one focus group agreed that the app needed to
be able to send calls to voicemail without making the phone
inoperable and without letting the caller know the call was
forwarded. Participant T16 stated that their ideal mobile app
would “let the phone ring in back so I can still use the phone.
But let the caller think it’s still ringing.” Participants also
discussed wanting an app that would warn them that a call
was spam while the phone was ringing, the importance of
including Caller ID, and the ability to support international
calls.
Pre/Post Spam Needs: Eight participants discussed features
that could assist users before or after receiving a spam call.
They expressed interest
in receiving tips and hints about
spam calls and knowing when to give personal information
or their phone number. If they miss a spam call, and the
spammer leaves a message, they would like the app to delete
that message. If they do receive a spam call, they would
like for the app to put them on the blacklist for that speciﬁc
number. So instead of having to answer the call and select
the appropriate button to be added to the blacklist for that
particular spam call, they wanted an app to do it for them.
Unfortunately, users could be putting themselves at risk by
adding their number to a list owned by an unknown entity.
If they are continuously bothered by a speciﬁc caller, they
would like the ability to report the spammer to the proper
authorities using the app.
Call Logs: Seven participants expressed interest in being able
to ﬁlter and monitor spam calls through the call log. They
want to be able to ﬁlter this list and see a list of spam calls
they have received and how many times a particular number
has called them. Participant T15’s call log would be able to
tell them “where the call was from, like by area code and
maybe even... if possible, tell me what kind of spam it was.
Like was it insurance, banking or whatever.” 4
Number Database: Five participants discussed having an app
that would be able to detail information about a particular
phone number by using crowd-sourcing. The app would use
feedback about phone numbers from various app owners and
use that to relay information to other users. Participant T12
said, “It [the app] should say ‘so many people reported this to
be a spam number’ or something like that.” Participants also
expressed interest in being able to search for an unknown
phone number within the app and retrieve information about it.
App Design: Three participants commented on app design.
Participant T06 suggested the app design be as simple as
possible. The other two participants discussed the app’s re-
lationship with the native app. Participant T10 believed that
the app should work with the native phone calling app, while
Participant T03 believed the app should replace the native
phone calling app.
D. Discussion
The focus group results show that cell phone users have
adopted common and unique practices to manage spam calls.
Only eight participants were using or had used a third-
party app or an app provided by their telecommunications
provider to manage spam calls. Based on the responses, some
participants did not know third-party apps were an option, or
they believed that their method worked well enough without
the additional application. However, everyone mentioned using
Caller ID to make call response choices, whether they used an
app to manage their calls or not. This is problematic because
Caller ID information is never authenticated. Currently, spam
is handled using blacklists which rely on Caller ID. Caller
ID can be spoofed, which makes blacklists and other Caller
ID based methods unreliable. Although most participants dis-
cussed receiving calls from familiar numbers that were actually
spam callers, they still relied on Caller ID.
like background color,
The results also suggest that people will react and adapt
differently to warnings. Therefore, designers should choose
characteristics,
that will effectively
communicate the message and should constantly update the
design as phones update. Users should not need to adapt or be
trained on what a warning means. They should be able to see
it and use context clues to understand it.
Finally, participants disliked the use of padlocks, emo-
jis, and a completely red background but liked the use of
a completely blue background, checkmark, “X” mark, and
Authenticated Caller ID in incoming call notices. However,
besides Authenticated Caller ID, these or similar attributes
4The focus group participants suggested various app features that are not
currently or widely available. Although these features could be helpful, it is out
of scope for this paper to investigate whether or not these app features would
be used if provided. We leave this task for future research. Our focus is on the
suggested design elements and the presentation of features for incoming call
announcements that are currently being implemented and further developed
like Authenticated CallerID.

can be seen in existing robocall apps on the market like apps
A5, A7, and A10 reviewed in Section IV. Although we did
not investigate built-in robocall apps, we believe that these
warning design elements could work for both third-party and
native apps.
VI. WARNING DESIGN USER STUDY
The app analysis results show that several anti-robocall
applications follow Wogalter’s warning design guidelines and
use a similar warning layout. The focus group results suggest
that users desired a warning with easy-to-interpret icons and
a noticeable background color that ﬁlls the entire screen. The
results also show that users relied heavily on Caller ID. As a
follow-up, we test the identiﬁed warning design elements that
the users desired and current applications use against reliance
on Caller ID. This section discusses those results by answering
the following ﬁve research questions:
RQ5:
RQ6:
RQ7:
Do robocall warnings impact users’ reaction time
to incoming calls?
Do robocall warnings affect users’ responses to
incoming calls from unknown numbers?
Do robocall warnings affect users’ responses to
incoming calls from known numbers?
RQ8: Will the “Available” (Avail-CID, Avail-Spam) and
“Focus” (Focus-AID, Focus-Spam) designs have
a signiﬁcantly different effect on user response or
reaction time?
How will participants rank the various designs
shown?
RQ9:
A. Methodology
We developed a mobile application to 1) display mock
phone calls (screenshots) and 2) capture the participants’
responses to the mock calls. Five warning designs were used
in the survey, as shown in Figure 5. The Control Design
(Control) is an imitation of what users of Android-based
Samsung Galaxy S7 devices would see if they received a call
without a robocall detection application.
Available Category: The Available category (Avail) was in-
spired by the app analysis results in Section IV, which is based
7
on the top ten currently available apps in the Google Play
Store. The majority of the selected apps used a red or blue
bar in the middle of the screen for their warning. Avail-CID,
the non-spam notiﬁcation, incorporated the blue bar and Caller
ID information. The Authenticated Call label was not added
because this was not incorporated in the apps we reviewed.
Avail-Spam, the spam warning, incorporated the red bar and
some of the Caller ID information. The name was removed
from the Caller ID because most of the screenshots from the
apps reviewed also removed the name, as shown in Figure 2.
Focus Category: The Focus category (Focus) was inspired
by the focus group discussions that covered both participants’
ideal app and feedback on suggested designs. Participants
mentioned the color red when describing their ideal app.
But when later shown warning suggestions, most noted that
the color red was too alarming, especially when it was the
