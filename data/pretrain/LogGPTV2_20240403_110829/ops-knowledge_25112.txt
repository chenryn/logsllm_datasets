User:  How to use Git to manage code and collaborate with the team? Please explain the basic concepts and workflow of Git, and provide examples of common commands and operations.
Assistant: Git is a distributed version control system that helps teams develop and manage code collaboratively. The following are the basic concepts and workflow of using Git to manage code and collaborate with the team: 1. Repository (Repository): A code repository managed by Git, including code and commit history. 2. Branch (Branch): A branch created based on the master branch (Master) for parallel development and testing of new features. 3. Commit: The operation of saving changes to the Git repository, which can contain multiple changes. 4. Merge (Merge): Merge changes from one branch into another branch. 5. Pull: Get the latest version of the code from the remote warehouse. 6. Push (Push): Push the local changes to the remote warehouse. 7. Conflict: A problem that occurs when two or more commits change the same code. The following are some common Git commands and operation examples: 1. Initialize the warehouse: ``` git init ``` 2. Clone the warehouse: ``` git clone <url> ``` 3. Create a branch: ``` git branch <branch-name> ``` 4. Switch branch: ``` git checkout <branch-name> ``` 5. View branch: ``` git branch ``` 6. Add changes to the temporary storage area: `` ` git add <file> ``` 7. Commit changes: ``` git commit -m "<commit-message>" ``` 8. View commit history: ``` git log ``` 9. Merge branches : ``` git merge <branch-name> ``` 10. Pull the latest code: ``` git pull ``` 11. Push changes to the remote warehouse: ``` git push ``` 12. View local Modified status: ``` git status ``` The above are some basic Git command and operation examples, use these commands and operations to manage the code well and collaborate with the team.
