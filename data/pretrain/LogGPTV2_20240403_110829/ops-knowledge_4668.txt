"A": "Benefit: MFA could prevent unauthorized software installations. Drawback: Restricting software may limit necessary administrative functions.",
"B": "Benefit: MFA could make it easier for adversaries to gain access. Drawback: Restricting software may cause an increase in network traffic.",
"C": "Benefit: MFA could streamline the software deployment process. Drawback: Restricting software may improve the performance of the network.",
"D": "Benefit: MFA could allow for a single point of failure. Drawback: Restricting software may create a false sense of security."
