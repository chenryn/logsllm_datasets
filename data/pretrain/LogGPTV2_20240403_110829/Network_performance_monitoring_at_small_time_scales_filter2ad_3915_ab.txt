may reach the link capacity despite the fact that a 5 minute
average value hardly reaches 60%. In addition, the 99th per-
centile of the delay distribution reaches higher values when
τ is equal to 10 ms and signiﬁcantly drops for values of τ
greater than 1 sec.
Our delay measurements for set1 occasionally exceed 1
ms with a maximum value of 4 ms. As a result, when τ
is equal to 1 ms, there will be packets in our data set that
remain inside the router for multiple 1 ms intervals. Since
we report delay measurements only when the packets are
seen at the output link, delay measurements lag behind the
utilization measurements. This is the reason why the 99th
percentiles reported at τ = 1 ms are smaller than measure-
ments at τ = 10 ms. This is an artifact of our methodology
since we rely on packets exiting from the monitored output
link to measure the delay experienced through the router.
Passive measurements on the router itself could correctly
reveal the amplitude of the episode also at the 1 ms time
scale.
Given that the 99th percentile of the delay measurements
across the entire trace does not exceed 4 ms, which is cor-
rectly measured at 10 ms intervals, both time scales of 1 ms
and 10 ms could accurately reveal the magnitude of micro-
congestion episodes for set1. The 99th percentile of the de-
lay distribution reported when τ =5 minutes is 1 ms, which
is signiﬁcantly smaller than 4 ms. Thus, computing the
delay percentile for longer periods of time is likely to hide
increased delays that persist for smaller periods of time.
Based on the relationship between delay and output link
utilization, a network operator could select the “accept-
able” link utilization levels that relate to acceptable de-
lays through each node. For instance, if one considers 1
ms of delay through a single node to be prohibitive then
links should not be allowed to exceed 70% utilization at a
10 ms timescale, and 55% utilization at 100 ms timescale
(Fig. 2). In that case, 99% of the packets going through the
router will experience single-hop delays less than 1 ms.
3.2.2 Results for OC-12 links
We continue our analysis using the second data set con-
sisting of two OC-12 links. We apply our methodology on
set2 and display the relationship between experienced de-
lays and output link utilization in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.
The output link utilization for the OC-12 set is much lower

sured over 1 ms time intervals. As a consequence, and due
to the higher link rate, delay measurements for the second
data set are much lower. The maximum delay in our data
set is 500 µs. In addition, due to the increased line rate the
diﬀerences between small and large time scale output link
utilization measurements are far more signiﬁcant.

Figure 4: Output link utilization vs. 99th delay per-
centile (OC-12).
The output link utilization computed over 5 minute inter-
vals hardly exceeds 300 Mbps (i.e. 40%). Nevertheless, the
output link utilization measured over 1 ms intervals reaches
97%. The amplitude of the micro-congestion episodes is bet-
ter revealed when measurements are taken at 1 ms intervals.
The 99th percentile of the delays experienced by packets
during the “overloaded” 1 ms time intervals is 250 µs, while
the respective statistic reported over 5 minute intervals is
70 µs. The fact that the 99th delay percentile signiﬁcantly
drops for 10 ms and 100 ms time intervals indicates that the
micro-congestion episodes occur infrequently, thus aﬀecting
a small number of packets in total.
4. FREQUENCY AND DURATION
With the previous analysis we showed that micro-congestion
episodes can be better revealed when measurements are taken
at intervals of duration equal to or below 10 ms. Given spe-
ciﬁc delay values that are considered prohibitive one can
identify the link utilization levels that should not be ex-
ceeded for bounded delay performance for each set. These
thresholds are likely to be deﬁned by the network operator
in accordance to the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in
place. Nevertheless, the impact of higher output link utiliza-
tion onto the delay experienced by packets is not a function
of the amplitude of the micro-congestion episodes alone, but
also the frequency of these episodes and their duration.
4.1 Methodology
To characterize the frequency of micro-congestion episodes,
we analyze output link utilization at diﬀerent time scales
and for diﬀerent values of the “acceptable utilization lev-
els” which we call thresholds (denoted as th).
If a micro-
congestion episode is persistent, then its eﬀect should be
signiﬁcant across multiple time scales. For instance, if a
link experiences a micro-congestion episode that lasts more
than 1 ms, then its eﬀect will “leak” into the higher analyzed
time scale, in our case 10 ms. Thus, one way to identify the
way micro-congestion episodes persist in time is by analyz-
ing link utilization at multiple time scales simultaneously.
Our requirements for the description of micro-congestion
episodes are that they can be reported in a concise form
at time intervals on the order of minutes. In addition, the
statistics that network elements need to compute should be
lightweight so as to avoid overload at the network nodes.
In order to characterize the frequency of micro-congestion
episodes we introduce a new SNMP metric FrOverload de-
ﬁned as follows.
FrOverload(τ , th):
the fraction of intervals of duration
τ that report a utilization level greater than th within each
5-minute interval.
Observing the statistics collected for a speciﬁc time scale
τ across diﬀerent values of th reveals the amplitude of the
episode. Observing the statistics collected for speciﬁc values
of th across multiple time scales reveals the duration of the
episode. For instance, if the number of congested intervals
at the smallest time scale is high and the number of con-
gested intervals at the next coarser time scale is low, we can
conclude that the congested intervals at the smallest time
scale are not sequential and thus their impact on network
performance should be limited. Lastly, the number of inter-
vals exceeding speciﬁc values of th at a speciﬁc time scale
reveals the frequency of the micro-congestion episodes of the
respective amplitude (determined by th).
4.2 Results
4.2.1 OC-3 results
We analyze the output packet trace out2 and compute
link throughput at the time scales of 1 ms, 10 ms, and 100
ms (since these time scales are the ones that can better
reveal the amplitude of an episode as shown above). Then,
for diﬀerent values of th, we count the number of intervals
within each 5-minute interval in the trace, that exceed the
speciﬁed threshold values. We present our results for the
three time scales and three diﬀerent values of th in Fig. 5.
We observe that when th is set to 50%, then approxi-
mately all the 100 ms intervals until 3 pm can be charac-
terized as “congested”2. Nevertheless, not all 1 ms intervals
exceed 50%. Therefore, at 1 ms intervals utilization may be
2Given that approximately all 100 ms intervals are utilized
less than 50%. The fact that utilization measured at 10 ms
still exceeds 50% indicates that when 1 ms intervals exceed
50% utilization they exceed it signiﬁcantly.
Indeed, when
th = 70% there are still 30% of the 1 ms intervals that get
characterized as “congested”. Such a ﬁnding veriﬁes our in-
tuition that throughput measured at the ﬁnest time scale
can greatly ﬂuctuate with time.
When the threshold value is set to 60%, the highest frac-
tion of “congested” intervals is reported by the 1 ms timescale,
but does not equally aﬀect the measurements at higher time
scales. Consequently, utilization measurements collected at
1 ms intervals are likely to exceed 60% but do not persist in
time and result in lower values at coarser time scales. Once
the threshold is set to 70% the diﬀerence in the fraction of
“congested” intervals across time scales is even greater.
