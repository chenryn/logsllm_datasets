tial inter-arrivals of intensity λ, but unlike it, inter-arrivals form a
positively auto-correlated AR(1) process, with correlation structure
Corr (i, i + j) = αj ,
j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , α ∈ [0, 1).
(3)
The delay constant j∗(α) of this geometric decay (extracted by set-
ting αj = e−j/j∗
) translates to a correlation time scale of τ ∗(α) =
j∗/λ = (λ ln(1/α))−1, which rises from 0 when α = 0 (the Pois-
son case), to ∞ as α → 1.
Figure 4 shows the effect of increasing α on the estimation of
mean delay, for four different non-intrusive probe streams of iden-
tical rate. In the left plot we see, as expected, a lack of bias for each
stream (note the vertical scale and conﬁdence intervals, offset for
visibility), in agreement with the results of Figure 1, regardless of
the value of α. In contrast, the right hand plot shows that the stan-
dard deviation of the estimates separate at large α. The important
point to note is that this separation clearly exceeds the conﬁdence
intervals: the Poisson stream has higher variance than either Pe-
riodic or Uniform. This is a counter-example making the general
point that Poisson sampling does not imply minimal variance.
We now offer some insight into why Poisson probing gives rise
to higher variance than Periodic in this case. First note that as the
correlations in the cross-trafﬁc increase, so do those of the virtual
delay process W (t) itself. If we could make estimates based on
W (t), they would therefore have increased variance3. Each prob-
ing scheme samples W (t), experiences the larger correlation at
higher α, and thereby inherits the larger variance. Exactly how
much variance however depends strongly on the details of the sam-
pling scheme, not merely on the average sampling rate λP . Bear-
ing in mind that samples which are closer together will be more
correlated, periodic probing has the advantage of guaranteeing a
minimum distance between them. It can therefore ‘jump over’ cor-
relation inducing bursts, provided that 1/λP is large compared with
the correlation scale of W (t). In contrast, in a Poisson process, ar-
rivals may be much closer than 1/λP with appreciable probability,
increasing the correlation considerably between such samples. In
the example here, 1/λP ≈ 20τ ∗
even for α = 0.9, so the periodic
stream produces close to i.i.d. samples in all cases.
In Figure 5 we consider the intrusive case for a wider range of
candidate probing schemes. We ﬁx α at 0.9, and examine depen-
dence as intrusiveness is increased by increasing probe size, shown
as a function of the ratio of probing load to CT load. The left-
most plot shows that bias is now present, and increases with α,
for all schemes except for Poisson (PASTA). The variance results
of the middle plot echo those seen in Figure 4: there are schemes
3It is well known [2] that the variance of the sample mean calcu-
lated over a time window of given width is essentially the integral
of the correlation function over the corresponding range of lags.
which perform both better and worse than Poisson. The rightmost
plot in Figure 5 combines bias and variance, and we see the trade-
offs at work: the relative overall performance of different schemes
changes with x. In particular, as bias becomes stronger for its com-
petitors at load ratios above 0.12, Poisson begins to outperform
Periodic, but continues to be outdone by the Uniform renewal with
wide support.
In this section we have presented only a few illustrations of what
is a general point: PASTA is silent on estimation variance, and
the performance of Poisson probing, for general cross-trafﬁc pro-
cesses, plays no privileged role with regard to variance. The same
holds true for MSE, with one exception. Asymptotically, as the
number of samples tends to inﬁnity, the variance of any consistent
estimator will tend to zero, resulting in the asymptotic MSE being
equal to the bias squared. In the intrusive case, this clearly gives
the advantage to Poisson probing. In general however, overall sta-
tistical performance is a function of how well the probing stream
is adapted to the cross-trafﬁc, and the nature of that trafﬁc. The
optimal approach (if any) will also be strongly determined by the
choice of constraints such as measurement duration, probe budget,
and acceptable intrusiveness proﬁle.
2.3 The Need for Technical Assumptions
Thus far in this section we have passed over the issue of tech-
nical assumptions. For instance, we assumed that PASTA holds
universally. In fact, its validity is dependent on other conditions,
most importantly the lack of anticipation assumption (LAA) men-
tioned in the introduction. Similarly, while Figure 2 indicated that
non-Poisson probing schemes have zero bias, this is true only if
suitable joint ergodicity conditions on the cross-trafﬁc and probe
trafﬁc are satisﬁed. Intuitively, ergodic systems are those which are
in some sense free enough to explore, in an unbiased way and on
a single sample path, the full range of behavior which one would
ﬁnd if one could examine all sample paths. It is also important to
note that zero bias, although an important objective, is not enough.
To be useful in practice, we also need measurements to converge
to the parameter to be estimated on a single sample path, as we
witnessed in each example thus far. To ensure this, again suitable
ergodic conditions are required. We defer a rigorous description of
these issues until the next two sections, and complete this one with
an illustrative example and intuitive explanation of these issues.
Figure 6 gives the outcome of a non-intrusive experiment which
is identical to that reported in Figure 1, but with one crucial differ-
ence: the Poisson arrival times of cross-trafﬁc have been replaced
by periodic arrivals of the same average intensity (packet sizes have
not been altered). Each probing stream continues to measure the
mean delay, and even the entire delay distribution, without bias,
with the exception of the periodic probe stream, which is markedly
different. In fact, since the period of the Periodic stream is equal
to an integer multiple of the cross-trafﬁc period (equal to 10 in this
case), the two streams are effectively ‘phase locked’, and in such
a case the joint ergodicity conditions are not satisﬁed. As a result,
the probes can never sample average conditions on this sample path
alone, but only those found at a particular point in the cycle of the
cross-trafﬁc arrivals.
Despite the rigidity of the periodic cross-trafﬁc, the other probing
streams do satisfy the required joint conditions since they are each
mixing processes, which is a stronger form of ergodicity. Similarly,
the joint ergodicity assumptions were satisﬁed in the cases shown
earlier of periodic probe trafﬁc and either Poisson or EAR(1) cross-
trafﬁc, since these latter processes were mixing. In a loose sense,
they provided enough variability to overcome the rigidity of the
periodic probes. We discuss this in more detail in the next section.
3. NON-INTRUSIVE MEASUREMENT
In the previous section we discussed sampling bias, inversion
bias, variance, and contrasted the intrusive and non-intrusive cases
in parallel. In this section we focus on sampling bias in the non-
intrusive case only, leaving the intrusive case (and most of our com-
ments on inversion) to Section 4. Our aim is to expand in a rigor-
ous way on the observations of Figure 1, that many processes other
than Poisson enjoy zero sampling bias in the non-intrusive case.
Although this case may not seem to be practically useful, since real
probes must always intrude, it turns out that the design of effective
practical probing is based on a clear understanding of this case. The
basis of our treatment is the machinery of ergodic theory [16] and
Palm calculus [1], in the context of marked point processes [3, 1].
We give an overview of these areas before proving our main result,
a description of precisely when the zero bias property is true.
3.1 Setting
We adopt a setting which allows for very general probe trafﬁc,
cross trafﬁc, and network models. We make the following assump-
tions: stationarity of the probe trafﬁc, cross-trafﬁc and the network
behavior, ergodicity of the cross-trafﬁc and probe trafﬁc, and inde-
pendence of the probe trafﬁc from the cross-trafﬁc. The assump-
tions on probes are not restrictive since the experimenter controls
the probing stream.
We model probe trafﬁc as a (strictly) stationary point process P
of intensity λP . That is, a sample path of the process is simply
the set of times {Tn} at which the (zero sized) probes arrive, and
there exists a probability law PP that determines the probability
of any event concerning sample paths. For example, it governs
the probability that the ﬁrst inter-arrival time after the time origin:
T2 − T1, equals or exceeds the mean value 1/λP (this would be
1 for periodic probes or e−1 for a Poisson stream), as well as the
probability that n probes fall in a time interval I1 and m in I2, for
intervals I1 and I2. No constraints are placed on PP; we allow any
structure of probe arrivals (provided points do not coincide).
We model cross-trafﬁc as a marked stationary point process T of
intensity λT . As before this consists of the arrival times of packets,
but now also marks, random variables associated with each packet
which give additional information about the trafﬁc. This includes
the random packet size, but also anything else which characterises
the stream, for example the packet sizes may depend on the arrival
patterns, or packet sizes, of previous arrivals. The probability law
PT governs all details of T , both of arrival times and marks.
The model of an end-to-end path typically used in active probing
is essentially the tandem queueing network of queueing theory. It
consists of a set of FIFO queues and transmission links in series,
each with its own independent cross-trafﬁc stream. Packets from
a given stream are all n-hop-persistent (traversing n hops before
exiting) and frequently n is simply taken to be 1 for each stream.
Our network setting is more than general enough to cover such a
model. However, it is not explicitly deﬁned in terms of queues like
the one above, but instead operates in an abstract setting, which
allows for even greater generality. It is capable of including cross-
trafﬁc streams correlated across nodes, cross-trafﬁc with feedback
such as TCP, non-FIFO scheduling disciplines, varying over nodes,
probes which follow different paths through a network (modelling
load balancing), and more, provided the above technical assump-
tions are satisﬁed. Technically, each of these cross-trafﬁcs, and
their dependencies, are contained in a single marked point process
T , where the marks carry most of the detailed information, such as
which nodes are traversed by a given packet. In this way, much of
our general network model, in fact all of its stochastic components,
is subsumed into a rich cross-trafﬁc description.

streams, and the true delay distribution. Right: resulting mean estimates. Each probing stream is unbiased, except for periodic.
The details of the queueing itself are not contained in T but
would have to be speciﬁed separately, for example, if one wished
to simulate the network. However, provided everything that is not
in T acts deterministically on the cross-trafﬁc and probe inputs,
it does not need to be speciﬁed explicitly. For example, our re-
sults hold ‘for free’ for each of FIFO, Weighted Fair Queueing, or
processor sharing queueing disciplines, since each of these is de-
terministic given the trafﬁc inputs.
The ﬁnal components of the basic setting is to specify the observ-
able, which is the quantity related to probes that we have access to,
and the ground truth, that is the quantity we wish to estimate. In the
case of active probing the available data is simply the arrival times
of probes to the receiver, or equivalently (since the sending times
Tn are known), their end-to-end delays. Since we consider only
the non-intrusive case in this section, the underlying observable or
‘ground truth’, which we denote by Z(t), t ∈ R, will be taken to
be the virtual delay process W (t) from Section 2. Recall that this
is the delay experienced by a zero sized observer entering at time t.
Our main goal is to learn about the process Z(t). Technically,
this reduces to determining the expectation E[f (Z(t))] of some
positive function f of Z(t). The choice of f gives us great freedom
in the kind of statistic we may wish to measure. Good examples,
which we have already met in Section 2, are the identity (giving
us the mean delay) or an indicator function noting whether Z(t) is
smaller than some threshold (giving us the CDF of delay). More
will be considered below.
With the setting established, we now indicate where sampling
and inversion ﬁt in to it. Probes sent at times {Ti} literally sample
Z(t) at those times. Hence, the values f (Z(T1)), f (Z(T2)), . . .,
are what is available to estimate E[f (Z(t))]. As we send more
probes, we have more samples and expect our estimates to improve.
Speciﬁcally, we want the following almost sure convergence:

f (Z(Tn)) = E[f (Z(0))].
(4)
For instance, if f is the identity function, the right hand side is
the mean virtual delay to which the sample mean estimate on the
left hand side must converge. Note that stationarity implies that
E[f (Z(0))] = E[f (Z(t))] for any time t.
3.2 Ergodic Theory and Palm Calculus
Statements like Equation (4), where an empirical average (the
left hand side) is equivalent to an ‘ensemble mean’ or mathemati-
cal expectation (the right hand side) are known collectively as er-
godic theorems [16]. Intuitively, this equivalence arises because a
single sample path of an ergodic process will over time come to
resemble every other sample path, with more extreme paths taking
appropriately longer to emerge. In Section 3.3 we determine when
Equation (4) holds. To do so, we must ﬁrst introduce key aspects
of ergodic theory and Palm calculus.
3.2.1 The Joint Law and the Product Space
To deal with ergodicity of the whole system, we must know the
joint law governing both probe and cross-trafﬁc. Because these are
independent, the events in the combined system can be described
through the product space of P and T , denoted by F, with an
associated probability law P which is the product of PP and PT .
Intuitively, (F, P ) enumerates all sample paths of the combined
system and their associated probabilities. The following example
illustrates this. Consider a system in which probe and cross-trafﬁc
are each periodic with a period of 1 time unit (for simplicity we
ignore the marks of T ). Each probing sample path is completely
determined by its phase y ∈ [0, 1) = T1, the distance from the time
origin to the ﬁrst probe. Similarly, the cross-trafﬁc is described by
a phase z ∈ [0, 1). We take the phases to be uniformly distributed
over (0, 1], so that each stream is stationary. Thus, each sample
path of the combined system is uniquely described by (y, z), which
