Assistant: Here are the steps to set up Remote Desktop Access on a Windows Server 2016 system: 1. Open Server Manager and select Local Server. 2. Click the Disabled link under the Remote Desktop option. 3. In the Remote Desktop Properties window, select Allow remote connections to this computer. 4. If you want to limit the range of users for remote desktop access, click the Select Users button and add or remove users. 5. Click Apply and OK after confirming the settings. 6. If your server is protected by a firewall, make sure that Remote Desktop traffic is allowed through the firewall. You can view the current settings by selecting the Local Server in Server Manager and clicking the Firewall tab. 7. Finally, connect to the server from a remote computer using a remote desktop client. In the remote desktop client, enter the server's IP address or computer name, and enter the user credentials you added in step 4. This allows for convenient remote management.
