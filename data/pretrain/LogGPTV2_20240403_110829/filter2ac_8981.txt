**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Operation Dream Job

In Operation Dream Job, the Lazarus Group employed a multi-faceted approach to conduct their Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks. They created fake email accounts to correspond with fabricated LinkedIn profiles, thereby establishing a facade of legitimacy. Additionally, the group set up email accounts that mimicked those of their intended victims, further enhancing the credibility of their deception. These tactics were designed to facilitate the BEC attempts by gaining the trust of the targets and ultimately leading to financial fraud. [12]
