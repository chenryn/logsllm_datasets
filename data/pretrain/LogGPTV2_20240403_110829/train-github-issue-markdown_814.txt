In requests-2.18.1 and earlier:
`requests.get('https://testssl-expire-r2i2.disig.sk/index.en.html')`
Used to raise `SSLError: ("bad handshake: Error([('SSL routines',
'tls_process_server_certificate', 'certificate verify failed')],)",)`
But as of requests-2.18.2 (the latest version), the same URL is returning
`ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='testssl-expire-r2i2.disig.sk',
port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /index.en.html (Caused by
SSLError(SSLError("bad handshake: Error([('SSL routines',
'tls_process_server_certificate', 'certificate verify failed')],)",),))`
I just need a confirmation that this change is intentional and if it is going
to remain so (or not).
Thanks.
