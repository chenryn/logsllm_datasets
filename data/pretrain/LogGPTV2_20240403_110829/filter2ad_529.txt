**Abstract:**
Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are integral to both personal and professional life. However, these networks are vulnerable to off-premises attacks that can bypass security protocols such as WEP, WPA, and even WPA2, posing a significant security risk. To address this, we propose SecureAngle, a system designed to enhance existing wireless security protocols by adding an additional layer of defense. SecureAngle leverages multi-antenna access points (APs) to profile the angles at which a client's signal arrives, creating unique signatures for each client. These signatures enable the AP to establish a "virtual fence" that blocks frames from clients physically located outside a building and prevent malicious parties from spoofing the link-layer addresses of legitimate clients.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, wireless local area network (WLAN) connectivity has transitioned from a niche service to an essential utility. Enterprises have deployed large-scale WLANs across entire campuses, and many homes now use WiFi-enabled routers. Mobile devices also integrate wireless WiFi chipsets, facilitating easy network connectivity.

From a security perspective, however, WLANs present several challenges. Once a client is connected to a compromised AP, an attacker can eavesdrop on users' traffic and inject malicious traffic into the wired network. Despite the introduction of security protocols like WEP, WPA, LEAP, and WPA2, these protocols have been frequently compromised. For example, six years after WEP was known to be insecure, Bittau et al. reported that 76% of secured APs in London still used it [3].

We propose SecureAngle, a new approach to these security problems. With the advent of 802.11n APs equipped with multiple antennas for MIMO schemes, we observe that with appropriate signal processing, a multi-antenna AP can measure the time differences of an incoming signal's arrival at each antenna. This information can be used to determine the angles of arrival (AoA), which can then be used to construct unique and difficult-to-forge client signatures.

We will investigate two applications of SecureAngle:
1. **Virtual Fences:** Restricting WLAN use to the building containing the AP. This is particularly useful in enterprise settings where only clients within the building should have access to the WLAN. The multipath propagation indoors makes it possible to distinguish between inside and outside clients.
2. **Address Spoofing Prevention:** Detecting when a client is spoofing the link-layer address of a legitimate stationary client. Our approach involves manually certifying a legitimate client's signature and comparing all incoming packets' signatures to the certified signature. A key challenge is tracking and updating signatures as environmental obstacles change.

## 2. Related Work
Several schemes have been proposed to capture signatures that characterize wireless clients' identity and location. The most commonly used physical layer information is received signal strength (RSS) [1, 4]. However, RSS is a coarse measure and is prone to errors and subversion by attackers using directional antennas [5].

SecureAngle offers unique advantages because it is extremely difficult for an attacker to generate a signal that arrives at the AP from the same directions as another client without being co-located with the latter. While Wong et al. [9] investigate the use of AoA information for localization, they do not address the problem of indoor multipath reflections, which we will.

## 3. Experimental Results
Our experimental testbed consists of a 4-antenna WARP [6] as the AP and Soekris boxes as transmitting clients. The WARP FPGA is programmed to support 4x4 MIMO reception at 2.4GHz. The AP and four Soekris boxes (N121, N122, N123, and N124) are positioned as shown in Figure 1. The 4 antennas of the WARP are arranged in a line with 6.1 cm (half the RF wavelength) separation.

The Soekris boxes are placed in different offices and transmit one by one. The WARP AP records the transmitted signals and outputs the sampled time domain information (amplitude and phase) for further processing. We implement the Schmidl-Cox algorithm in Matlab to detect the preamble of packets and apply the MUSIC method to calculate AoA information. Figure 2 summarizes the results, showing the ground-truth angle for each client and the AoA of the strongest incoming signal.

To test simultaneous transmissions, we force two Soekris boxes to transmit simultaneously by turning off CSMA/CA. We modify the Schmidl-Cox algorithm to detect overlapping packets, even if the second packet is weaker than the first. Both packets are detected, and the AoA pseudo-spectrums for both transmitters are shown in Figure 3 (upper). The two curves in Figure 3 (upper) correspond to the two packets from different Soekris boxes. Multiple peaks on the curve indicate multipath reflections in the indoor environment for each transmission. With 4 antennas, up to 3 peaks can be captured, corresponding to one direct path and two multipaths.
