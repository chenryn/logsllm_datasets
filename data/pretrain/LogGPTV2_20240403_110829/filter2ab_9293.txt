**ATT&CK ID:** T1599  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Boundary Bridging

Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices that are responsible for network segmentation. By breaching these devices, adversaries can bypass the restrictions on traffic routing that typically separate trusted and untrusted networks. This technique allows them to move laterally within the network, potentially accessing sensitive areas that would otherwise be inaccessible.
