User: How to safely configure and manage sudo privileges in the Linux operating system?
Assistant: The following are recommendations for safely configuring and managing sudo privileges in a Linux operating system: 1. Limit the use of sudo privileges. Authorize only necessary users and commands, and ensure proper authentication when using sudo commands. 2. Check and update the sudo installation package. System packages are regularly updated to address any security gaps. 3. Log all sudo activity. Keep track of all activity happening on the system by logging each user's sudo command usage and their execution results. 4. Use two-step verification. Enables two-factor authentication functionality on the use of sudo privileges. 5. Use the necessary permissions for sudo. Even users with sudo privileges should avoid using root or other privileges beyond their responsibility. 6. Consider giving sudo permission. Their position, responsibilities, and experience should be considered when granting sudo privileges. 7. Regularly review sudo permissions. Periodically review sudo permissions to ensure they are appropriate for the account. 8. Use authorized repositories. Obtain sudo and other packages from authorized software sources. 9. Use a password policy. Use a strong password policy for superuser/administrator password management. 10. Check the system log. Check that events that occur during the use of the sudo command are logged in the syslog.
