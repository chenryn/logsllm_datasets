**Title: Botconf2022 - See Ya Sharp: A Loader’s Tale**

Simply distributing malware is no longer a viable strategy for cybercriminals, as defense mechanisms have become increasingly sophisticated. To evade detection by antivirus and anti-malware scanners, malicious actors now employ loaders to conceal the final payload. Despite their frequent use, these loaders often go unnoticed. This research focuses on the CyaX-Sharp loader (also known as ReZer0) due to its unique capabilities and the fact that it is frequently overlooked.

CyaX-Sharp is capable of loading any type of Windows executable, but it is most commonly used to deploy stealers. This presentation delves into the inner workings of the CyaX-Sharp loader, including a flaw in its payload decryption routine. Additionally, an automatic payload and configuration extraction tool will be introduced. Following the technical discussion, the talk will provide insights into the observed samples and trends within the data.
