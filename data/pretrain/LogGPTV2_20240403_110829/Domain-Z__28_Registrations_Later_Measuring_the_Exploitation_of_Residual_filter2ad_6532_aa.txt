## Abstract
When an individual re-registers an expired domain, they inherit the residual trust associated with its prior use. This paper examines how adversaries exploit changes in domain ownership to undermine user and system security. We find that many seemingly disparate security issues share a common root cause: the abuse of residual domain trust. Our study, which spans six years, identifies 27,758 domains from public blacklists and 238,279 domains resolved by malware that were re-registered maliciously after expiration. To address this problem, we propose a technical solution, Alembic, a lightweight algorithm that uses passive DNS observations to flag potential domain ownership changes. We also discuss several policy remedies.

## 1. Introduction
Domain names serve as the de facto root of trust on the Internet. However, they can also be a source of insecurity when security systems assume domain ownership remains constant. For example, authentication systems often rely on email for password resets, which can fail if the domain's ownership changes. An adversary can exploit this by maliciously re-registering the domain and hijacking the email address.

In this paper, we investigate the exploitation of domain ownership changes and find that residual trust abuse is a common underlying cause of various security issues. These include:
- Siphoning university traffic and email by exploiting expired nameserver domains.
- Hijacking Regional Internet Registry (RIR) accounts and allocating IP addresses using expired email domains.
- Distributing malicious updates for benign software, including an instance that left users of a major Linux distribution vulnerable.

Despite the serious consequences, the scope of this phenomenon has not been rigorously characterized. Our study aims to fill this gap by analyzing data collected over six years. We show that adversaries are actively exploiting residual trust, and the problem is growing rapidly. We propose both technical and non-technical remedies to address this issue.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Definition of Residual Trust
Residual trust refers to the historical reputation of a domain that is implicitly transferred with changes in ownership. When a domain expires, it can be re-registered, and the new owner inherits the trust associated with the domain's prior use.

### 2.2 Domain Expiration Process
Domains are typically registered for one or more years. As a domain approaches its expiration date, it enters the ICANN-mandated expiration process. This process includes notification attempts and a Redemption Grace Period (RGP), during which the domain can still be renewed by the previous registrant at a higher cost. After the RGP, the domain becomes available for re-registration.

### 2.3 Post-Expiration Behavior
Even after a domain expires, third-party users may still attempt to connect to it, often through automated tools. The new owner of the domain can exploit this residual trust to intercept and manipulate these connections, leading to security vulnerabilities.

## 3. Abusing Residual Trust
We present five real-world examples of residual trust abuse, demonstrating the unintended consequences of domain expiration:

### 3.1 Expired Nameserver Domains
One of the DNS nameserver domains for Benedictine University, bobbroadband.com, expired. The new owner, an SEO company, redirected all traffic destined for ben.edu to an advertising site, potentially leaking sensitive university emails.

### 3.2 Expired Email Domains
Expired email domains can be used to hijack RIR accounts and allocate IP addresses. By registering these domains, an adversary can request a password reset and gain control over the allocated CIDRs.

### 3.3 Expired Browser-Related Domains
Many browser plugins contact specific domains on startup. If these domains expire and are re-registered, the new owner can push malicious updates or take control of the developer account, leading to potential security issues.

### 3.4 Expired Open Source Software Domains
The photo editing tool Gimp failed to renew its domain, gimp.org, but was recovered before a malicious actor could offer corrupted versions of the software. In another case, the debian-multimedia.org domain was re-registered, allowing the new owner to push malicious software updates.

### 3.5 Expired Spam Domains
Domains previously used for spam can be re-registered for non-abusive purposes. However, the new owner may face automatic censorship, as seen when a domain purchased to market a Christian film, Unstoppable, was blocked by Facebookâ€™s spam detection systems.

## 4. Measuring Residual Trust Abuse
To measure the scope and growth of residual trust abuse, we analyzed data from 2009 to 2015, focusing on expired domains, public blacklists, and malware feeds.

### 4.1 Datasets
- **Expired Domains (DG):** 179,326,265 unique domains identified through zone transfers and EPP.
- **Blacklist Domains (DB):** 320,009 unique domains from eight public blacklists.
- **Malware Domains (DM):** 6,112,964 unique domains queried by malware, compiled from academic and commercial feeds.
- **Potentially Abused Expired Domains (DZ):** 385,741 domains that expired and appeared on blacklists or were resolved by malware.

### 4.2 Results
- **Scope:** 8.7% of domains on public blacklists and 3.9% of domains resolved by malware were re-registered after expiration.
- **Growth:** The number of observed blacklist instances of abuse increased from 784 between 2009 and 2012 to over 9,000 in 2014 alone.

## 5. Proposed Solutions
### 5.1 Technical Solution: Alembic
Alembic is a lightweight algorithm that uses passive DNS observations to flag potential domain ownership changes. It scales to large amounts of traffic and requires only access to historical DNS data. Using Alembic, we identified several cases of potential residual trust abuse, including an expired APT domain.

### 5.2 Policy Remedies
We discuss several potential policy changes, such as improving WHOIS data accessibility and implementing stricter domain renewal policies. These measures aim to reduce the risk of residual trust abuse and enhance overall Internet security.

## 6. Conclusion
Our study highlights the significant and growing problem of residual trust abuse in domain names. By proposing both technical and policy solutions, we aim to mitigate the risks associated with domain ownership changes and improve the security of users and systems.
