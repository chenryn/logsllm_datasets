User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Curl extension not working - PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library php_curl.dll I am using Apache 2.2 server, PHP 5.3.6 on a Windows 7 OS running on a 64-bit system.

On starting Apache server, this error appears in the apache error log- 


  PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'D:\php5\ext\php_curl.dll' - The specified module could not be found.\r\n in Unknown on line 0


Following are the other extensions mentioned in the php.ini file - 

extension=php_curl.dll
extension=php_gd2.dll
extension=php_mbstring.dll 
extension=php_mysql.dll
extension=php_xsl.dll
extension=php_memcache.dll


Echoing phpinfo() does not show the curl extension loaded, but the others are loaded.

The php_curl.dll file is however present in the correct location along with the others - 
    D:\php5\ext\php_curl.dll

phpinfo() shows that 

extension_dir = D:\php5\ext


So, that also is correct.

Some more details  

I am a new member in this team and I had setup Apache, PHP separately on this Windows 7 system and everything was working fine. 

Our project needed a lots of httpd conf changes, so I was asked to simply overwrite the httpd conf file with the team's current version. I did the same and just changed the ServerName, ServerAdmin etc. I also copied their PHP installation directory. 

Everything other than this extension is working fine.

Assistant: The reason was most probably absence of some necessary dll files. Check my other question Apache start failing after apache config modifications, showing syntax error, cannot load php5apache2_2.dll into server which I put later, after getting some similar crazy errors. I have described the solution there.
