Abstract—The security of capacitive touchscreens is crucial
since they have become the primary human-machine interface
on smart devices. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents WIGHT, the ﬁrst wired attack that creates ghost touches
on capacitive touchscreens via charging cables, and can ma-
nipulate the victim devices with undesired consequences, e.g.,
allowing malicious Bluetooth connections, accepting ﬁles with
viruses, etc. Our study calls for attention to a new threat
vector against touchscreens that only requires connecting to
a malicious charging port, which could be a public charging
station, and is effective across various power adapters and even
USB data blockers. Despite the fact that smartphones employ
abundant noise reduction and voltage management techniques,
we manage to inject carefully crafted signals that can induce
ghost touches within a chosen range. The underlying principle is
to inject common-mode noises over the power line to avoid being
effectively ﬁltered yet affect the touch measurement mechanism,
and synchronize the malicious noise with the screen measurement
scanning cycles to place the ghost touches at target locations. We
achieve three types of attacks: injection attacks that create ghost
touches without users touching the screen, alteration attacks that
change the detected legitimate touch position, and Denial-of-
Service attacks that prevent the device from identifying legitimate
touches. Our evaluation on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 standalone
touchscreen panels, 6 power adapters, and 13 charging cables
demonstrates the feasibility of all three type attacks.

I. INTRODUCTION
As capacitive touchscreens have become essential interfaces
for humans to interact with a variety of consumer electronics,
e.g., smartphones, tablets, and even vehicles [1], [2], reliable
touch operation becomes critical not only for usability but also
for security. Several recent news has reported “Ghost Touch”,
i.e., the touchscreen outputs fake touches and starts to control
the device by itself yet users impose no physical contacts
on the screen at all [3], [4], [5], [6]. In one case [6], the
ghost touches on a charging smartphone booked a presidential
suite that cost more than a thousand dollars by itself without
raising the user’s awareness. To the best of our knowledge,
this phenomenon has not been studied before and motivates
us to investigate the trustworthiness of capacitive touchscreens
as well as their security implication on the victim devices.
Particularly, we analyze the underlying causes and investigate
whether a malicious attacker can intentionally create ghost
touches for device exploitation.

his smartphone at a malicious charging station via a charging
cable, an attacker can inject elaborate signals to generate ghost
touches on the touchscreen or to disable the touch service, even
across a power adapter or a USB data blocker.
This paper discovers a new type of threat vector against
touchscreens: An attacker injects malicious touches to the
touchscreen of a smartphone via its charging cable and power
adapter as shown in Fig. 1, instead of via an electric ﬁeld [7]
or electromagnetic (EM) radiation [8]. We call such attacks
WIGHT, and we envision that the attack device can be a
malicious public charging station as shown in Fig. 1, which
is widely used in cafes, hospitals, hotels, etc. [9]. When users
charge their devices publicly, the attacker transmits a carefully
crafted malicious signal via the power lines to the victim
device such that it induces ghost touches on the touchscreen
and manipulates the device, e.g., tapping the button to accept
a malicious connection. Since such attacks only utilize the
power lines as the attack surface, they are harmful even to
those security-conscious users who may disable the USB data
connection with data blocker gadgets.
Injecting challenge. Injecting ghost touches via charging
cables is difﬁcult. Essentially, the malicious signals injected
via charging cables are noises, and modern devices are
equipped with abundant noise reduction [10] and voltage
management technique [11] to ensure stable power supply
and safe operations. Unsurprisingly, technologies ranging from
noise ﬁlters, voltage converters, and regulators,
to power
management integrated circuits (PMIC), will eliminate noise.
To inject ghost touch successfully, a naive method will be in-

creasing the noise strength large enough such that the injected
signals survive these reduction technologies, which, neverthe-
less, may damage the hardware of devices. To overcome this
challenge, we manage to inject a common-mode (CM) signal
by applying signals to the GND line of the charging cable.
We ﬁnd that the CM signal can not be ﬁltered completely
and can result in a differential-mode (DM) signal due to the
asymmetric circuits [12]. The DM signal can interfere with
the measurement of the touchscreen capacitance such that it
emulates the scenarios as if a user is touching the screen.
Controlling challenge. Controlling the positions of ghost
touches via a single charging cable is challenging since
attackers have little control over how and where the injected
malicious signals traverse over the complicated device circuits.
To overcome the challenge, we propose signal enhancement,
and synchronization strategies to fulﬁll desired and control-
lable ghost touches. Firstly, below the surface of a capacitive
touchscreen is an array of parallel electrodes, and the position
of a genuine touch is identiﬁed by exciting the electrodes
sequentially and measuring the capacitance changes. Thus,
measuring the excitation signal cycle and synchronizing the
malicious signals accordingly may induce ghost touches within
the targeted position range. Secondly, touchscreens are de-
signed to be robust against external EMI or electrostatic dis-
charge (ESD) [13], which can be exploited: Applying a strong
EMI or ESD can cause the touch service to be temporarily
disabled by the ESD-induced soft failures [14]. Thus, by
designing the strength, frequency, and timing of the malicious
signals, we achieve controllable ghost touch injection.
touches along the line that
WIGHT achieves three types of attacks: injection attacks,
alteration attacks, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Injec-
tion attacks can induce ghost touches along a chosen line on
the screen without the user touching the screen. Alteration
attacks induce ghost
the user
touches, i.e., altering the detected touch position. DoS attacks
can prevent the device from identifying the user’s normal touch
operations. The three attacks can be combined to achieve the
undesired consequences such as connecting to a malicious
Bluetooth connection, etc. We evaluated the performance of
WIGHT on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 standalone touchscreen
panels, 6 power adapters, and 13 charging cables. The results
show that WIGHT can achieve three types of attacks (injection
attacks, alteration attacks, DoS attacks) at the success rates of
93.33%, 66.67%, and 100%, respectively. We summarize our
major contributions as follows:
• We propose WIGHT, the ﬁrst ghost touch attack against
capacitive touchscreens by injecting signals via a charg-
ing cable (with or without a power adapter). WIGHT can
inject ghost touches regardless of whether the screen is
being touched or not and can disable the touch-based
input of victim devices.
• We analyze the underlying principle of successful ghost-
touch injection theoretically and experimentally. We ﬁnd
that due to the asymmetric circuits, a CM noise on the
power line can be converted into a DM noise, which

II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce the background knowledge of
capacitive touchscreen and electromagnetic interference.
A. Capacitive Touchscreen
Capacitive touchscreens sense touch by measuring the ca-
pacitance changes induced by physical contacts of a user. Since
they can detect multiple touches simultaneously, they become
the dominant screens for smartphones and tablets [2], [15],
[16]. To detect a touch, a capacitive touchscreen and its aux-
iliary sensing circuit work together to detect the capacitance
variation caused by a touch.
1) Structure of Capacitive Touchscreen: A typical mutual
capacitive touchscreen has ﬁve layers, as shown in Fig. 2(a): a
cover layer, TX electrodes (TXs), a sensor glass, RX electrodes
(RXs), and a substrate layer. The critical component of a
touchscreen is a conductive electrode matrix consisting of
TXs and RXs, forming a mesh of mutual capacitors, whereby
each crosspoint of the electrodes forms a parallel-plate mutual
capacitor [17], [18], as shown in Fig. 2(b).
To localize a touch, TXs are excited sequentially by the
excitation signal with its magnitude being Vex, where Vex =
VT X − VRX, and VT X and VRX are the potential of TXs
and RXs, respectively. The excitation signals are alternating
current (AC) signals, e.g., sine or square waves, and will drive
the outputs of the sensing circuit, Vout, which reﬂects the
capacitance changes proportionally. Since each TX electrode is
overlaid with n RX electrodes, the sensing circuit will output
n Vout with each mapping to the capacitance change at the
corresponding crosspoint. Once a user touches a crosspoint
on the screen with a ﬁnger, the mutual capacitor underneath
will change and the Vout will exceed the threshold Vth. Thus,
detecting the location of a touch is equivalent to ﬁnding the
Vout that exceeds the threshold.
2) Sensing Circuit: The main role of the sensing circuit
is to convert the capacitance change into the output Vout
proportionally, which will then be digitized by an analog-
digital converter (ADC) and processed by a CPU. A typical
