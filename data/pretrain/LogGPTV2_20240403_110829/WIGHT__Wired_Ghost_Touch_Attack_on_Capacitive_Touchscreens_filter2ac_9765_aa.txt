## Abstract
The security of capacitive touchscreens is crucial as they have become the primary human-machine interface on smart devices. This paper introduces WIGHT, the first wired attack that creates ghost touches on capacitive touchscreens via charging cables, enabling manipulation of victim devices with undesired consequences, such as allowing malicious Bluetooth connections or accepting files with viruses. Our study highlights a new threat vector against touchscreens that only requires connecting to a malicious charging port, which could be a public charging station, and is effective across various power adapters and even USB data blockers. Despite the fact that smartphones employ numerous noise reduction and voltage management techniques, we successfully inject carefully crafted signals that can induce ghost touches within a chosen range. The underlying principle is to inject common-mode noises over the power line to avoid being effectively filtered while affecting the touch measurement mechanism, and to synchronize the malicious noise with the screen measurement scanning cycles to place the ghost touches at target locations. We achieve three types of attacks: injection attacks that create ghost touches without users touching the screen, alteration attacks that change the detected legitimate touch position, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks that prevent the device from identifying legitimate touches. Our evaluation on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 standalone touchscreen panels, 6 power adapters, and 13 charging cables demonstrates the feasibility of all three types of attacks.

## I. Introduction
Capacitive touchscreens have become essential interfaces for interacting with a variety of consumer electronics, including smartphones, tablets, and even vehicles. Reliable touch operation is critical not only for usability but also for security. Recent news reports have highlighted "Ghost Touch," where the touchscreen outputs fake touches and controls the device without any physical contact from the user. In one notable case, a charging smartphone booked a presidential suite costing over a thousand dollars without the user's awareness. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been studied before, motivating us to investigate the trustworthiness of capacitive touchscreens and their security implications on victim devices. Specifically, we analyze the underlying causes and investigate whether a malicious attacker can intentionally create ghost touches for device exploitation.

### Illustration of WIGHT Attacks
When a user charges their smartphone at a malicious charging station via a charging cable, an attacker can inject elaborate signals to generate ghost touches on the touchscreen or disable the touch service, even across a power adapter or a USB data blocker. This new type of threat vector against touchscreens involves an attacker injecting malicious touches via the charging cable and power adapter, rather than through an electric field or electromagnetic (EM) radiation. We call these attacks WIGHT, envisioning the attack device as a malicious public charging station, commonly found in cafes, hospitals, hotels, etc. When users charge their devices publicly, the attacker transmits a carefully crafted malicious signal via the power lines, inducing ghost touches and manipulating the device, such as tapping the button to accept a malicious connection. These attacks are harmful even to security-conscious users who may use data blockers to disable USB data connections.

### Challenges and Solutions
#### Injecting Challenge
Injecting ghost touches via charging cables is challenging because modern devices are equipped with noise reduction and voltage management techniques to ensure stable power supply and safe operations. A naive approach would be to increase the noise strength, but this can damage the device hardware. To overcome this, we inject a common-mode (CM) signal by applying signals to the GND line of the charging cable. The CM signal cannot be completely filtered and can result in a differential-mode (DM) signal due to asymmetric circuits. The DM signal interferes with the touchscreen capacitance measurement, emulating a genuine touch.

#### Controlling Challenge
Controlling the positions of ghost touches via a single charging cable is difficult due to the complex device circuits. To address this, we propose signal enhancement and synchronization strategies. By measuring the excitation signal cycle and synchronizing the malicious signals, we can induce ghost touches within the targeted position range. Additionally, by designing the strength, frequency, and timing of the malicious signals, we can achieve controllable ghost touch injection.

### Types of Attacks
WIGHT achieves three types of attacks:
1. **Injection Attacks:** Induce ghost touches along a chosen line on the screen without the user touching the screen.
2. **Alteration Attacks:** Alter the detected touch position.
3. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Prevent the device from identifying the userâ€™s normal touch operations.

We evaluated WIGHT on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 standalone touchscreen panels, 6 power adapters, and 13 charging cables. The results show success rates of 93.33%, 66.67%, and 100% for injection, alteration, and DoS attacks, respectively.

### Major Contributions
- **Introduction of WIGHT:** The first ghost touch attack against capacitive touchscreens via charging cables, capable of injecting ghost touches regardless of whether the screen is being touched and disabling touch-based input.
- **Theoretical and Experimental Analysis:** We analyzed the underlying principles of successful ghost-touch injection, finding that a CM noise on the power line can be converted into a DM noise, interfering with the touchscreen capacitance measurement.
- **Validation and Countermeasures:** We validated the feasibility of WIGHT on 9 commercial touchscreen devices and proposed countermeasures to mitigate the threat.

## II. Background
### A. Capacitive Touchscreen
Capacitive touchscreens detect touch by measuring capacitance changes induced by physical contacts. They can detect multiple touches simultaneously, making them the dominant screens for smartphones and tablets.

#### Structure of Capacitive Touchscreen
A typical mutual capacitive touchscreen has five layers: a cover layer, TX electrodes (TXs), a sensor glass, RX electrodes (RXs), and a substrate layer. The key component is a conductive electrode matrix consisting of TXs and RXs, forming a mesh of mutual capacitors. Each crosspoint of the electrodes forms a parallel-plate mutual capacitor.

To localize a touch, TXs are excited sequentially by an excitation signal with magnitude \( V_{ex} \), where \( V_{ex} = V_{TX} - V_{RX} \). The excitation signals are alternating current (AC) signals, driving the outputs of the sensing circuit, \( V_{out} \), which reflects the capacitance changes proportionally. When a user touches a crosspoint, the mutual capacitor changes, and \( V_{out} \) exceeds the threshold \( V_{th} \), indicating a touch.

#### Sensing Circuit
The sensing circuit converts the capacitance change into the output \( V_{out} \), which is then digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and processed by a CPU. The main role of the sensing circuit is to convert the capacitance change into a proportional output.

### B. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can cause disruptions in electronic devices. Touchscreens are designed to be robust against external EMI and electrostatic discharge (ESD). However, strong EMI or ESD can temporarily disable the touch service, leading to soft failures. By designing the strength, frequency, and timing of the malicious signals, we can exploit this to achieve controllable ghost touch injection.
