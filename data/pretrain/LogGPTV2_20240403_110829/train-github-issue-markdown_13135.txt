#### Challenge Name
http://beta.freecodecamp.com/en/challenges/css-flexbox/using-the-
flexdirection-property-to-make-a-row
#### Issue Description
I guess since the default value for `flex-direction` is row, this test can
pass without doing anything at all. Maybe a reg-ex is in order to make sure
the user enters code?
