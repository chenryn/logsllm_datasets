Assistant: The steps to use Ansible to realize automatic deployment and configuration management are as follows: 1. Install Ansible: Install Ansible on all operation and maintenance hosts. 2. Configure the hosts file: define the list of hosts to be managed on all operation and maintenance hosts. 3. Write scripts: use yaml language to write ansible scripts, which include a series of tasks and variables. 4. Configure variables: Configure variables in the playbook to make changes as needed. 5. Deploy the application: Run the automated deployment process through playbooks. 6. Configuration management: Use Ansible to manage the configuration of the host, such as package installation and configuration file update. 7. Automated testing: Use Ansible to test the environment to ensure that the functions are working properly. 8. Monitoring: Use Ansible to monitor the running environment, and automate update and maintenance operations. Through the above steps, Ansible can be used to realize automated deployment and configuration management, which helps to improve efficiency and reduce the possibility of manual operation errors.
