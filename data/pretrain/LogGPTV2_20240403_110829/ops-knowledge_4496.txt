User: I cannot run any script by pressing F5 or selecting run from the menus in IDLE. It stopped working suddenly. No errors are coughed up. IDLE simply does nothing at all.
Tried reinstalling python to no effect.
Cannot run even the simplest script.
Thank you for any help or suggestions you have.
Running Python 2.6.5 on windows 7.
Could not resolve the problem with idle. I have switched to using pyDev in Aptana Studio 3.
Assistant: I am using a Dell laptop, and ran into this issue.  I found that if I pressed Function + F5, the program would run.
On my laptop keyboard, functions key items are in blue (main functions in white).  The Esc (escape) key has a blue lock with 'Fn' on it.  I pressed Esc + F5, and it unlocked my function keys.  I can now run a program in the editor by only pressing F5
Note: Running Python 3 - but I do not think this is an issue with Idle or Python - I think this is a keyboard issue.
