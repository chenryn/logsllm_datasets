To effectively implement CIS Control 14.7, which focuses on training the workforce to identify and report missing security updates, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Develop a Comprehensive Training Program:**
   - Create a detailed training curriculum that covers the importance of keeping software up-to-date, the risks associated with outdated software, and the steps to verify if enterprise assets are missing security updates.
   - Include practical examples and case studies to illustrate the impact of unpatched vulnerabilities.

2. **Educate Employees on Verification Techniques:**
   - Train employees on how to use available tools and methods to check for missing security patches and updates.
   - Provide hands-on training sessions or workshops to ensure that employees can confidently perform these checks.

3. **Establish Clear Reporting Procedures:**
   - Define a clear and straightforward process for reporting out-of-date software patches or any failures in automated patch management tools.
   - Ensure that employees know who to contact (e.g., IT personnel) and how to escalate issues if necessary.

4. **Encourage Proactive Communication:**
   - Foster a culture where employees feel comfortable and responsible for reporting any identified issues related to missing security updates.
   - Emphasize the importance of timely communication to minimize potential security risks.

5. **Regularly Update and Reinforce Training:**
   - Schedule periodic refresher courses to keep the workforce informed about the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices.
   - Conduct regular assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of the training and make necessary adjustments.

6. **Integrate Training into Onboarding and Ongoing Development:**
   - Incorporate this training into the onboarding process for new employees.
   - Ensure that it is part of the ongoing professional development plan for all staff.

**Additional Information:**
- **Asset Type:** N/A
- **Security Function:** Protect

By following these procedures, an organization can ensure that its workforce is well-equipped to identify and report missing security updates, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.
