User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题scp to remote server permission denied I try to copy files to a remote server (OSXServer) using scp. I have 2 user accounts on that server with what I thought the exact same settings. Now I tried the copying files into the respective home folder (every user has one home folder) on the server.
This works for one account but not the other.
How can I find out why this is happening and maybe change the settings so that I can copy stuff with both accounts?(I have administrative access with both accounts according to the workgroup manager)

Edit:

It is a pure permission problem as "touch" does not work either with the one user account.

Edit2:

chown -R "usrname" "folder"


also gives me permission denied.

Edit3:
To top the weirdness:
Everywhere else except of the home directory it works fine...

Edit4:
I have no idea why the server was set up in such way but now I could change the permissions logging in as root...

Assistant: Log in using your super user and set work location to your other account and give some group permission to your weird account.
