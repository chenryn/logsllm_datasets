source code does not. Therefore, devices using port 2323 as their
telnet port will continue to present an open port even after infection.
Figure 7b shows a host being infected with two variants at the same
time, XWIFZ and AKUMA, before restarting and getting infected
afterwards with other variants. In total, we observe 8.9% of the total
infected devices being infected by multiple variants at one time.
Note that this behavior is the result of a co-infection and not of two
devices behind a NAT, when the packet generation of both stop
simultaneously. In [21], we further elaborate on the issue of NATs
and show how the faulty RNG can be used to identify NATs, and
thus can be used to quantify IP churn across the Internet.
While this oversight in the Mirai source code transfers to most of
its descendants, several malware authors put in effort to understand
the inner workings and have removed this oversight from their
code base. When looking at the variants present on concurrently
infected devices, we can identify several variants that do succeed in
killing their competitors and locking them out. While MIORI and
JOSHO are present on 5680 and 3726 concurrently infected devices,
we find no rivals when MASUTA and SORA are running, showing
them to be more effective in stopping competition.
6.1.3 Compatibility of Malware. While botnet size has a significant
influence on its ability to infect new victims, we also see major
differences in infection characteristics between different countries
and autonomous systems (ASes). Figure 10a shows the duration a
particular strain has control over a given device until it reboots, for
a selection of ASes which more than 1,000 compromised devices.
While the average duration of an infection is relatively short, there
are major outliers where a large share of IoT malware can hold on
to devices for up to a week or longer. As can be seen on the box
plots, average values of infection times are not a good measure to
understand the behavior of IoT malware, given the sheer number of
these outliers and their deviation from the mean. Not only are the
distributions highly heterogeneous, but we see also the emergence
of clusters, indicating that there are groups with similar behavior.
We can clarify this behavior better if we look at infection char-
acteristics not only from the perspective of the victim device, but
in symbiosis with a particular malware strain. Figure 10b breaks
down the infection duration for one of the ASes with large out-
liers. Here, we see that the time a particular malware strain holds
a device captive is vastly different. In case of AS9121, MIORI and
MASUTA are largely unsuccessful in maintaining a foothold and
devices reboot on average after 106 and 32 minutes. The fact that
in 99% of cases neither malware runs longer than 239 minutes on
vulnerable IoT devices within this AS before the device resets and is
later infected by something else, suggests some incompatibility of
this malware or the way it is used with a particular type of host pre-
dominantly used in this network. We can rule out that this behavior
is the result of coordinated cleanup activities or some centralized
reboots due to a power outage, as devices eventually and at differ-
ent times fall victim again. As we see from the graph, it appears
that JOSHO is a more suitable IoT malware for this AS, while the
best performance is achieved by Hajime with an average infection
duration 9 times larger than the average for this AS, and even the
shorter Hajime infections outperforming the best performers of

the other IoT malware by far. We find similar heterogeneity for
many ASes and malware types. It seems that malware frequently
causes issues, and reboots of IoT devices can be attributed not just
to external influences (user reboots, power outages, updates, etc.)
but to a significant degree to the malware itself.
6.2 Customization and Evolution
Different types of malware seem to work better or worse depending
on the AS devices are located in. Once an IoT device reboots, it is
just a matter of time before it is re-discovered and reinfected. As
shown previously, the larger a botnet is, the faster it can locate
routers to potentially infect. This makes it hard for new botnets
to enter the “market” and compete successfully for vulnerable de-
vices. In response to this, it would make sense for botmasters to
customize their strategy where to look for victims, and localize
productive niches to exploit [10]. Such customization could on the
one hand be done by only targeting the address space of particular
ASes, or on the other hand be done based on curating credential
lists. Using open-source intelligence, actors could identify default
username/password combinations for devices that occur frequently
but are not so mainstream that other botmasters might target them.
6.2.1 Regional biases. One way of creating a niche in which a
botnet can thrive is by targeting devices not in demand by others.
In the case of Mirai, which sole attack vector is the use of weak
credentials, the way to target new devices would be the addition of
new username and password combinations which no other variant
uses. An effective approach would be to include credentials that
are used by a significant number of devices as their default. With
devices such as routers deployed in bulk by telecom operators to
their customers, the location of these devices can be heavily bi-
ased to a region. When a variant targets such a device, it would
therefore grow its influence in a specific geographic location. In
figure 11, the distribution per country is plotted for different Mi-
rai variants. The biggest botnets, MIORI and Mirai, occur widely.
Others however, such as AKUMA and MASUTA, are heavily biased
to Japan and Vietnam respectively. This imbalance stems from the
credentials: AKUMA includes 17 unique username and password
