User: I'm attempting to get the user's IP from inside of my upload handler, but it seems that the only IP supplied is 0.1.0.30. Is there any way around this or any way to get the user's actual IP from inside of the upload handler?
Assistant: Try checking for user IP at the point where you generate upload url via create_upload_url().
The upload handler is actually called by Blobstore upload logic after the upload is done, hence the strange IP.
