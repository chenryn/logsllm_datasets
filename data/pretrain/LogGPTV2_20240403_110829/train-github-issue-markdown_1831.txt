### Issue: Hough Circle Detection - Reporting Quality/Accumulator Count

**Transferred from:** http://code.opencv.org/issues/2318  
**Reported by:** Dmitry Ponv  
**Date:** 2012-08-27 23:52  
**Priority:** Low  
**Affected:** None  
**Category:** imgproc, video  
**Tracker:** Feature  
**Difficulty:** None  
**PR:** None  
**Platform:** None / None  

#### Description
Currently, the Hough circle and line detection algorithms in OpenCV do not report the quality or accumulator value of each detected circle. This value, `max_count`, is discarded after the function executes. The relevant code snippet is as follows:

```cpp
if (max_count > acc_threshold) {
    float c[3];
    c[0] = cx;
    c[1] = cy;
    c[2] = (float)r_best;
    cvSeqPush(circles, c);
    if (circles->total > circles_max) {
        return;
    }
}
```

This omission makes the Hough circle detection feature less useful because it does not provide any information about the relative strength or dominance of the detected circles. The only way for a programmer to determine which circles are more significant is to repeatedly run the Hough circle detection with a decreasing minimum accumulator threshold until a circle is detected.

This issue has also been discussed on the OpenCV forum:
- [Yahoo Group Discussion](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV/message/88871)

I may have already submitted this feature request, but I am not sure if it was processed. I did not find it in the list of issues.

- **Comment:** Thank you for the request, Dmitry. Please note:
  - High priority should not be used for such requests. We need more people to request the same feature to determine its importance.
  - You can propose a patch for this feature and submit it as a pull request on GitHub.
- **Actions:**
  - Priority changed from High to Low
  - Category set to imgproc, video

- **Comment:** The accumulator output would indeed be useful for both the Line and Circular Hough transforms. I had to write my own implementation of the Hough transform to get the accumulator values, but it is unfortunately quite slow.

- **Comment:** +1, this feature would be very useful.
- **Question:** Are the returned circles ordered according to their accumulator value?
