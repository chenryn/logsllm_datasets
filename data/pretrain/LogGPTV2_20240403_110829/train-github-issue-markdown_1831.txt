## Hough Circle detection to report the quality/accumulator count of each
circle detected
    Currently the Hough circle (and line) detection algorithms do not report the quality/accumulator value of each detected circle. This value "max_count" is thrown out after the function 
            if( max_count > acc_threshold )
            {
                float c[3];
                c[0] = cx;
                c[1] = cy;
                c[2] = (float)r_best;
            cvSeqPush( circles, c );
                if( circles->total > circles_max )
                    return;
            }
    This makes the Hough circle detection almost completely useless, because it reports a number of circles and the programmer doesn't know which circles are more dominant than others. The only way for the programmer to know is to run the Hough circle detection repeatedly and decrease minimum accumulator level until a circle shows up.

    I may have already submitted this feature, but I'm not sure if it went through, I didn't find it in the list,

    Dmitry, thank you for the request, but please note:
    # You shouldn't use High priority for things like this. We need more people asking for the same feature to say if it is important.
    # You can propose your patch for the feature. It can be submitted as a pull request at the github.
    -   Priority changed from High to Low
    -   Category set to imgproc, video

    Indeed, the accumulator output would be useful (for both the Line and Circular Hough). Though it forced me to write my own implementation of Hough transform to get accumulator, it is unfurtunately quite slow.

    +1 It would be useful.
    I believe the returned circles are ordered according to their accumulator value (?)
