User: I have a directory containing N subdirectories each of which contains setup.py file. I want to write a python script that iterates through all subdirectories, issues python setup.py bdist_egg --dist-dir=somedir, and finally removes build and *.egg-info from each subdirectory and I have two questions:

Can I invoke bdist_egg without using os.system? Some python interface would be nicer.
Can I tell bdist_egg not to generate build and *.egg-info or is there any complementary command for setup.py that cleans this for me?
Assistant: I would use subprocess. I believe setup.py command line arguments should be your interface.
Check setup.py clean --all
