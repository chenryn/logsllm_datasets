User: I recently attempted to install python 3.2 along with IDLE 3 on my macbook pro. I successfully installed python 3.2 (as in, I can run it from the terminal), but when I attempted to install IDLE 3.2 I must have done something wrong because now both IDLE 2.7 and IDLE 3.2 crash immediately upon opening with the message "Python quit unexpectedly", no matter whether I open it through the terminal or through finder. Does anyone know how to fix this? I have installed the correct ActiveTCL package (and reinstalled) and still nothing. I have attempted to reinstall python 3.2 and IDLE 3 but I am not sure whether I did it correctly. Through a good amount of googling I found some people say that it was most likely a path issue but all of the solutions I found were using Windows so I am not sure how to apply that to my mac.
Assistant: I had the same issue. I run OSX 10.8.5, Python 3.3.3 and IDLE 3.3.3 and reinstalling Python haven't been a solution.
I solved any problem removing the ~/.idlerc directory. My problem showed for the first time when I tried to change some Preferences (IDLE->Preferences->General->Startup Preferences->At Startup Open Edit Window), so I suppose that's why resetting my Preferences deleting ~/.idlerc  folder have been the solution.
