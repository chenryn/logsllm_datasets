3.2 Object Detection with FMCW Radar
Commercial mmWave radars typically transmit periodic frequency
modulated continuous wave (FMCW) signals [46] whose frequency
increases linearly within each frame period. The radar can localize
an object by estimating the distance and angle of arrival (AoA) of
reflected signals [57]. Distance estimation relies on counting the
time-of-flight, whereas AoA estimation relies on an array of Rx
antennas. For an object whose distance is 𝑑𝑜 and AoA is 𝜃𝑜 , the
baseband signal of the 𝑘-th Rx antenna is [46]:
𝑠 (𝑡, 𝑘) = 𝑃𝑟 𝑒−4𝜋𝑖 𝛾𝑑𝑜
𝑐 𝑡 𝑒−2𝜋𝑖 𝑘𝛿𝑎 cos 𝜃𝑜
𝜆
,
(2)
where 𝛾 and 𝑐 denote the FMCW frequency slope and light speed. 𝛿𝑎
represents the spacing between adjacent Rx antenna elements. The
first phase term is due to the propagation delay between the radar
and the object, while the second is due to the relative propagation
delay between the Rx antennas.
To estimate the distance of the object, an IFFT is applied over
the time domain 𝑡:
𝑆1 (𝑑, 𝑘) = IFFT[𝑠 (𝑡, 𝑘)] ≈ 𝑃𝑟 𝛿 (𝑑 − 𝑑𝑜 )𝑒−2𝜋𝑖 𝑘𝛿𝑎 cos 𝜃𝑜
𝜆
,
(3)
𝑆1 (𝑑, 𝑘) achieves the maximum when 𝑑 = 𝑑𝑜 . To further estimate
the AoA of the object, the pseudo spectrum 𝑆2 (𝑑𝑜, 𝜃 ) is calculated by
applying beamforming weights 𝑤𝑘 = 𝑒2𝜋𝑖 𝑘𝛿𝑎 cos 𝜃
to the frequency
samples 𝑆1 (𝑑𝑜, 𝑘):
𝜆
𝑆 (𝑑𝑜, 𝜃 ) =𝑘
𝑤𝑘𝑆 (𝑑𝑜, 𝑘) ≈ 𝑃𝑟 𝛿 (𝜃 − 𝜃𝑜 ).
(4)
When 𝜃 = 𝜃𝑜 , the RSS 𝑃𝑟 can be approximated with 𝑆 (𝑑𝑜, 𝜃𝑜 ).
In practice, by recognizing peaks at different distances in 𝑆1 (𝑑, 𝑘)
and different AoAs for each distance in 𝑆2 (𝑑𝑜, 𝜃 ), the locations and
reflected RSS of all prominent reflecting points can be estimated,
generating a radar point cloud.
The radar’s distance (range) resolution Δ𝑑 , and angle resolution
Δ𝜃 , is inversely proportional to the sampling bandwidth 𝐵 and
number of antennas 𝑁𝑎, respectively. For example, the recently
developed TI automotive radar [22] has 𝐵 = 4 GHz and 𝑁𝑎 = 8,
translating to Δ𝑑 = 3.75 cm and Δ𝜃 = 14.3◦, respectively. It might
be tempting to create a simple RF barcode by placing multiple metal
pieces at predefined spots on a road sign to encode information,
much like [28]. Unfortunately, given the coarse angle resolution, it is
infeasible for a radar to discriminate the pieces at a few meters away.
The specular reflection will also render such a barcode undetectable
168
unless the radar stays at its normal direction.
4 MMWAVE RETROREFLECTIVE TAG
DESIGN
An RoS road sign must be easily detectable by a radar within a
wide angular range, and be distinguishable from other irrelevant
objects on the road. In addition, its RCS should be large enough,
so that the reflected signals can be detected by a passing-by radar,
which can be a few lanes away from the curb. RoS innovates an
array of passive retroreflectors to meet these challenges, which will
be detailed in this section.
4.1 Retroreflection within the Azimuth Plane
A primer on Van Atta Array (VAA). RoS realizes the mmWave
retroreflector by extending the classical Van Atta Array (VAA)
structure which was invented in the 1960’s [49]. As shown in Fig. 2,
a basic VAA consists of a linear array of antenna elements with
equal spacing of 𝜆
2 . The symmetric elements (with respect to the
center of the array) are interconnected by transmission lines (TLs).
Signals received by each antenna are propagated through the TLs
and re-radiated by its connected peer on the other end. Suppose
an incident far field wavefront induces a phase offset, 𝜓 , between
adjacent antennas. The incident signal phase at the 𝑘-th antenna,
relative to that at the 0-th antenna, is −𝑘𝜓 . By setting the lengths of
each TL to differ by multiples of 𝜆𝑔 (i.e., the wavelength of the signal
guided in TLs), a constant wrapped phase offset 𝜑 is introduced for
all signals propagating through the TLs. Consequently, given the
number of antennas 𝑁 , the 𝑘-th antenna receives and re-rediates the
signal from the (𝑁 −1−𝑘)-th antenna, whose phase is 𝜑−(𝑁 −1−𝑘)𝜓 .
Its phase relative to the 0-th antenna is (𝜑 − (𝑁 − 1 − 𝑘)𝜓 ) − (𝜑 −
(𝑁 − 1)𝜓 ) = 𝑘𝜓 , which is reversed compared to the phase of the
incident signal arriving at it. In other words, the re-radiated signal is
steered back to the direction of arrival, i.e., the VAA is retroreflective.
VAA design choices for RoS. The use of multiple incident and
re-radiation antennas essentially makes the VAA a passive beam-
forming reflector which focuses towards the interrogator. Ideally,
the more antenna pairs in a VAA, the larger its RCS should be. How-
ever, the aforementioned VAA model assumes a single tone signal
whose guided wavelength is 𝜆𝑔, whereas in RoS, the interrogator
is a radar with a wide bandwidth, and hence the difference of the
guided wavelength across frequencies becomes non-negligible. Fur-
thermore, more antenna pairs means a longer TL length and more
propagation loss which limits the RCS contribution of the outer
antenna pairs. Thus, we analyze how to optimize the VAA design
in RoS to account for these factors.
Recall that the different TLs differ by multiples of 𝜆𝑔. The radar
signals at different frequencies experience phase misalignment
when propagating through variable length TLs. Consequently, the
phase misalignment becomes unavoidable as the length difference
between TLs increases. Suppose the bandwidth and center fre-
quency of the radar are 𝐵 and 𝑓𝑐 , and the maximum length differ-
ence between the shortest and longest TL is 𝛿𝑙 , the maximum phase
misalignment between the frequencies 𝑓𝑐 + 𝐵
𝛿𝑙 ,
where 𝑐𝑔 is the signal propagation speed in the TLs. To avoid de-
structive interference between antenna pairs, the maximum phase
misalignment should be smaller than 𝜋
2 and 𝑓𝑐 − 𝐵
2 , is 2𝜋 𝐵

2 , i.e., 2𝜋 𝐵

For a typical automotive radar with 𝐵 = 4 GHz, we have 𝛿𝑙 ≤
4.94𝜆𝑔. Given that the total spacing between adjacent antenna pairs
is 2 · 𝜆
= 𝜆, the length difference of adjacent TLs, denoted as Δ𝐿,
should be at least 𝜆 to avoid antenna overlap. Accordingly, since
Δ𝐿 must be an integer multiple of 𝜆𝑔 and 𝜆𝑔 < 𝜆, the minimum
Δ𝐿 needs to be 2𝜆𝑔. Therefore, for RoS to retro-reflect automotive
radar signals, the optimal number of antenna pairs on each VAA is
4.94𝜆𝑔
⌈
⌉ = 3.
2𝜆𝑔
Verifying the design choices. To verify the above design choices,
we conduct experiments in Ansys HFSS, a 3D electromagnetic (EM)
field simulator. We lay out VAAs with different number of antenna
pairs and simulate their RCS across the wide frequency band of
an automotive radar, i.e., 76-81 GHz. As shown in Fig. 3, the RCS
contribution per antenna pair is maximized with 3 antenna pairs
and marginally increases beyond that which matches the above
model. Thus, to maximize the utility in terms of RCS per antenna
pair, a VAA in RoS should have at most 3 antenna pairs.
The ideal VAA model [49] assumes perfect lossless, point-scatter
antennas and a single frequency. To verify the retroreflectivity of
the VAA in the presence of practical wideband mmWave radar
signals, we conduct another HFSS simulation and compare the 6-
element VAA with a uniform linear array (ULA) of 6 patch antenna
elements. The ULA can be considered as an ordinary reflective
object comprised of a few metal patches. Fig. 4a shows the measured
RCS when a monostatic radar passes by from different azimuth
angles. We see that the VAA has a relatively flat RCS within a
field-of-view (FoV) of approximately 120◦, which verifies its retro-
directive property. In contrast, the ULA acts like a specular reflector,
and only responds with a strong RCS when the radar faces it straight
on. Note that the FoV of the VAA or ULA cannot reach 180◦ since
each patch antenna element itself has a limited radiation angle.
A side benefit of retroreflectivity is that interogating radar signals
169
arriving from different angles do not interfere with each other. Fig. 4b
showcases a scenario where a radar interrogates the VAA at an
