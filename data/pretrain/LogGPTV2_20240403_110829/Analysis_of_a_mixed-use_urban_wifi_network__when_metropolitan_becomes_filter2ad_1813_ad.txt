101) at four distinct periods throughout the day: 5–6 am, 9–10 am,
3–4 pm, and 6–7 pm corresponding to the peaks and valleys of
Figure 4. For each time period and region, we show the number
of clients, activity time across those users, and total bytes trans-
ferred. To facilitate comparison across time periods and areas, yet
preserve the privacy of users in these select geographic areas, we
normalize the histograms for each particular value (bytes, activity,
and users) to the average for that value over all classes of clients
and time periods—in other words, the sum of all the histograms for
a particular value is thirty six.
We see signiﬁcant differences between the network use across
the geographic areas. Not only does the proportion of modem,
smartphone, and hotspot users vary across locations, but the usage
patterns within these user classes also differs substantially. For ex-
ample, we see far more smartphones in the transit area surrounding
Highway 101 than any other type of device, but the smartphones
show almost no usage. Indeed, the few hotspot users we do see
transfer more data cumulatively than the smartphones. In contrast,
smartphones are far less prevalent in the residential area, appear-
ing in similar numbers to hotspot users. However, those we do
observe are substantially more active than those in the transit area.
Not surprisingly, modem users represent a signiﬁcant fraction of
the residential usage, at least in terms of trafﬁc and activity if not
in total number. Moreover, their usage appears less time dependent
than the other devices.
The commercial area is the most active, with signiﬁcant usage
across all three classes of clients. Modem activity is similar to that
in residential areas, but the absolute number of both smartphones
and hotspot users is signiﬁcantly higher. Mobile (i.e., smartphone
and hotspot) usage peaks in the commercial area in the middle of
the afternoon (hotspot usage is off scale, with a normalized byte
count of 6.2 and user count of 5.4), yet remains strong across all
periods, unlike the other two, which show far less usage in the early
morning hours. Unsurprisingly, the number of clients in the tran-
sit area peaks during rush hours, while residential usage is highest
during the evening (not shown).
6.2 Concentration
For a metropolitan network covering an entire city, an interesting
deployment question is to what extent the full set of nodes in the
network are actively being used. Figure 16 shows the average num-
ber of simultaneous clients supported by each AP over the course
of a day. Clients are distributed widely: the busiest AP supports
just over 14 simultaneous clients and all but the least-utilized 5%

are serving at least one client on average. Obviously, by this ac-
counting, all APs contribute substantially to the network coverage.
The number of clients using the network varies by a factor of
two over the course of the day, however. Hence, one might expect
a similar variation in the number of APs in active use. Figure 17
plots the number of access points in use throughout the day for
several deﬁnitions of “in use.” The “any clients” line shows that
even in the dead of night over 80% of the APs are servicing at least
one client. The diurnal usage pattern is much more apparent if
we consider only heavily used APs, e.g., those with three or more
simultaneous clients. Of course, simply removing “lightly used”
APs might leave some clients without access. Hence, we plot a ﬁnal
line, “no oscillations,” which counts only APs that are servicing
one or more clients that have no alternative. Because we do not
have access to client-side 802.11 information, we have no way to
know deﬁnitively if a client has more than one accessible AP at its
current location. Here, we consider a client to have an alternative
AP if it is currently associated to an AP that has been (or will be)
involved in oscillatory behavior at some point that day. In other
words, if there exists some client, C, that oscillates between APs
X and Y at any point in the day, we consider any clients (not just
C) associated with either X or Y to have alternatives. The “no
oscillations” line plots the number of APs required to cover the set
of clients currently active using our deﬁnition of alternatives.
An alternative way to view network coverage is not in terms of
client connectivity but rather in terms of aggregate network activ-
ity as in Figure 3. Figure 18 replots the “any clients” line from
Figure 17, but compares it against the APs that supported at least
100 and 1000 seconds of activity in aggregate per 15-minute inter-
val, respectively. We calculate the total activity time at each AP
and sort them in order of increasing activity time, with the least
active node ﬁrst. Figure 19 shows the results of successively re-
moving nodes in sorted order. The x-axis shows the number of
access points removed (in sorted order of increasing activity time).
The y-axis shows the fraction of all activity time a given set of
nodes contribute. At each step, we calculate the fraction of activity
time contributed by all of the remaining nodes—the ﬁrst step corre-
sponds to the activity of all of the nodes, the second to all nodes mi-
nus the least active node, etc. Interestingly, we do not ﬁnd a heavy
tail to the curve, indicating that all nodes are relatively active and
contribute to useful network coverage throughout Mountain View.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we study the usage of the Google WiFi network,
a freely available outdoor wireless Internet service deployed in
Mountain View, California. We ﬁnd that the aggregate usage of the
Google WiFi network is composed of three distinct user popula-
tions, characterized by distinct trafﬁc, mobility, and usage patterns
that are characteristic of traditional wireline, wide-area, and local-
ized wireless access networks. Modem users are static and always
connected, and place the highest demand on the network. Hotspot
users are concentrated in commercial and public areas, and have
moderate mobility. Smartphone users are surprisingly numerous,
have peak activity strongly correlated with commute times and are
concentrated along travel corridors, yet place very low demands on
the network.
