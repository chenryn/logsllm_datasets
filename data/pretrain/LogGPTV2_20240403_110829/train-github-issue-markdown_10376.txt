Ubuntu 12.04, vscode 0.10.1
Currently when you run `Code` if there is an instances already running (or
shift clicking the app icon in Windows/Ubuntu) it will activate the currently
opened window. This should open a new instance, the same goes for opening a
new instance of `Code` with a folder as an argument when an instance is
already open.
It's a very common use case for many developers to have multiple editors with
the same folder open.
**Repro:**
  1. `Code` (open instance of vscode)
  2. `Code`
**Expected:**  
A new instance of vscode is opened
**Actual:**  
The current instance of vscode is activated
