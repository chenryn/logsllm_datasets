Question: "In an Android Keymaster module, a developer is attempting to export a public key using the `exportKey` method. The key was generated without providing any `Tag::APPLICATION_ID`. What will be the result of this export attempt?"
 "A": "The method will export the key successfully as `Tag::APPLICATION_ID` is not required for exporting keys."
 "B": "The method will return ErrorCode::OK because the absence of `Tag::APPLICATION_ID` does not affect key export."
 "C": "The method will return ErrorCode::INVALID_KEY_BLOB because `Tag::APPLICATION_ID` was not provided during key generation."
 "D": "The method will return ErrorCode::KEYMASTER_NOT_CONFIGURED since `Tag::APPLICATION_ID` is a mandatory field for key export."
Answer: C
