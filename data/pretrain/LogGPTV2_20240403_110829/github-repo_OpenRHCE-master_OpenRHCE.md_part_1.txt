- ISBN-10: 0071765654 | ISBN-13: 978-0071765657
- Publication Date: June 17, 2011

**Classroom Approach:**
- The textbook will not be followed closely in class but is essential for background reading, reference, and out-of-class practice.

**Course Goals:**
- **Primary Goal:** Prepare to pass the RHCE Exam (assuming passage of the RHCSA Exam)
- **Secondary Goal:** Prepare to pass the RHCSA Exam
- **Tertiary Goal:** Acquire high-level, enterprise-oriented Linux skills
- **Not a Goal:** Basic or user-oriented Linux skills (assumed as prerequisites)

#### Reasonable Expectations

- **Passing the RHCE on the First Attempt:**
  - Even seasoned professionals often fail on their first attempt (estimated at 50% or more).
  - Planning for multiple attempts is prudent.
  - Pass rates improve significantly on second attempts.

- **Maximizing Out-of-Class Preparation:**
  - Essential for success.

### Operating a System

**Boot, Reboot, Shutdown:**
- Power On
- GRUB Menu
- Display Manager Screen
- Gnome or KDE
- Terminal commands: `shutdown`, `halt`, `poweroff`, `reboot`, `init`

**Runlevels:**
- Default
- From GRUB Menu

**Single User Mode:**
- Password Recovery
- Note: SELinux bug prevents password changes while set to "Enforcing."

#### Exercise 1-2: Use Single-user mode to recover a root password
- Reboot your virtual machine.
- Activate the GRUB Menu.
- Boot the system in Single User Mode.
- Set SELinux to Permissive Mode.
- Change the root password.
- Set SELinux back to Enforcing Mode.
- Activate runlevel 5.
- Login as root with the new password.

#### Exercise 1-3: Boot into runlevel 3
- Reboot your virtual machine.
- Activate the GRUB Menu.
- Boot the system into runlevel 3.
- Login as root.
- Transition the system back to runlevel 5.

**Log Files:**
- Common log files: `/var/log/*`, `/root/install.log`, `/root/anaconda-ks.cfg`
- View with `cat`, `less`, or other tools.
- Search with `grep`.

#### Exercise 1-4: View Logs from an x-term and a virtual terminal
- Launch a gnome-terminal session and browse the `/var/log/messages` file.
- Switch to a virtual terminal, login as root, and view `/var/log/secure`.

**Start/Stop Virtual Machines:**
- Using `virt-manager`:
  - Select the desired VM. There are several approaches to these operations in the GUI.
- Using `virsh` commands:
  ```bash
  # virsh list --all
  # virsh start <vm-name>
  # virsh stop <vm-name>
  # virsh destroy <vm-name>
  ```
- **Note:**
  - `stop` requests a graceful shutdown.
  - `destroy` forces a poweroff—data loss could result.
