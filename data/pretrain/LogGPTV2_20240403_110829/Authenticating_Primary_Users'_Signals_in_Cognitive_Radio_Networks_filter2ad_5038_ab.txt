primary user. To avoid interfering with the transmission of
the primary user, the helper node transmits signals to sec-
ondary users only when the primary user is not transmitting.
Therefore, the helper node should ﬁrst sense the channel to
decide whether the primary user is transmitting.
Unfortunately, the helper node cannot simply employ
traditional primary detection approaches to determine the
presence of the primary user’s signal, since the attacker may
mimic the primary user’s signal and inject fake signals into
the target channels.
In this section, we propose a novel physical-layer authenti-
cation approach that enables the helper node to authenticate
the primary user’s signal without using any training link
signatures. Intuitively, the multipath effect exhibited by the
primary user’s signal and observed by the helper node has
some unique properties, since the primary user is very close
to the helper node. In our approach, we utilize such unique
multipath effect to enable the helper node to distinguish the
primary user’s signal from those transmitted by attackers.
In the following, we ﬁrst give our observation behind our
new technique, then describe the proposed authentication
approach, and analyze the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.
A. Observation
Ideally, signal strength decreases as the signal propagates
farther away from the transmitter. A short propagation path
results in a large received signal amplitude, whereas a long
propagation path leads to a small received signal amplitude.
Assume that there is no obstacle between the primary
user and the helper node. The primary user is close to
the helper node. This means the ﬁrst received multipath
component travels on a very short path, which is a straight
line between the primary user and the helper node. Unlike
the ﬁrst received multipath component, the second received
multipath component travels along a longer path. According
to [13],
the length of the path over which the second
received (resolvable) multipath component travels should be
R , where c is the speed of light and R is the
larger than c
transmission rate.
If the distance between the primary user and the helper
node is much smaller than c
R , then the amplitude of the ﬁrst
received multipath component is much larger than that of the
second received multipath component. In other words, the
amplitude ratio of the ﬁrst received multipath component to
that of the second received multipath component is a large
number, as illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Amplitude ratio. T , R, and B is the primary user, the helper
node, and an obstacle, respectively. The signal transmitted by T travels
along two paths: path 1 (T → R) and path 2 (T → B → R). Let P 1
and P 2 denote the amplitudes of the signal received from path 1 and path
2, respectively. The length of path 1 is much smaller than that of path 2,
resulting in a large amplitude ratio P1
P2
.
B. Authentication Method
Based on the above observation, we propose to use the
amplitude ratio r = P1
to authenticate the signal from the
P2
primary user, where P1 and P2 are the amplitude of the ﬁrst
and the second received multipath components, respectively.
For each newly received signal, the helper node computes
the amplitude ratio r, and then compares r with a threshold
w. If r > w, then the received signal is marked as the
primary user’s signal. Otherwise, the received signal is a
suspicious signal that may have been sent by an attacker,
and are discarded.
For the sake of presentation, we use ra and rp denote
the amplitude ratio of the attacker’ signal and that of the
primary user’s signal, respectively. We would like to point
out that the values of ra and rp depend on the positions
of obstacles. Due to the randomness and uncertainty of the
surroundings, ra (rp) may not always be smaller (larger)
than the pre-determined threshold w. Hence, we may have
two types of possible errors: false alarm and false negative.
With a false alarm, rp  w, and thus the attacker’s signal is
incorrectly identiﬁed as the primary user’s signal.
In Sections V-C and VII, through both theoretical analysis
and experiment evaluation, we will show that the probability
of false alarm and the probability of false negative decrease
quickly as the distance between the attacker and the helper
node increases.
1) Computing the Amplitude Ratio: A helper node can
ﬁrst measure the channel impulse response of a received
signal, and then calculate the amplitude ratio based on the
measured channel impulse response. In Lemma 1, we show
that the amplitude ratio of the ﬁrst multipath component to
the second multipath component indeed equals the amplitude
ratio of h1 to h2, where h1 and h2 are the component
responses for the ﬁrst and the second multipath components,
respectively.
Lemma 1: Let s1 and s2 denote the ﬁrst and the second
received multipath components. The amplitude ratio r of s1
to s2 equals to that of h1 to h2, where h1 and h2 are the
component responses for s1 and s2.
is h(τ ) = PL
Proof: Recall that the channel impulse response h(τ )
l=1 alejφl δ(τ − τl). Assume the ﬁrst and the
second multipath component arrives at time τ1 and τ2. Thus,
the component responses h1 and h2 for the ﬁrst and the
second multipath components are: h1 = h(τ1) = a1ejφ1 δ(0)
and h2 = h(τ2) = a2ejφ2 δ(0). According to [14], the
amplitude ratio of h1 and h2 can be transformed as follows:
= ka1k
kh1k
kh2k
ka2k
The channel gain al of the l-th multipath component is al =
sl
, where sl and st is the l-th received multipath component
st
and the transmitted signal [14]. Therefore,
= ka1(cos φ1 + i sin φ1)k
ka2(cos φ2 + i sin φ2)k
= ka1ejφ1 δ(0)k
ka2ejφ2 δ(0)k

Figure 4 shows a channel impulse responses obtained
from the CRAWDAD data set [32], which contains over
9,300 channel impulse responses measured in an indoor en-
vironment with obstacles (e.g., cubicle ofﬁces and furniture)
and scatters (e.g., windows and doors). The second multipath
component arrives at the receiver about 100 microseconds
after the arrival of the ﬁrst one. Each multipath component
leads to a triangle in shape with a peak (i.e., the component
response) [23], and the helper node can use the ﬁrst and the
second peaks as kh1k and kh2k to compute the ratio r.

a real measured channel impulse response (i.e., link signature) obtained
from CRAWDAD for a 2.4 GHz channel, and kh1k and kh2k corresponds

kh2k ≈ 0.55 × 10−3, and r = kh1k
kh2k ≈ 1.49.
2) Real-world Examples: Figures 5 and 6 show two real-
world examples of channel impulse responses obtained from
the CRAWDAD data set [32]. In Figure 5, the receiver
is positioned 13.77 meters away from the transmitter. We
can see that the corresponding amplitude ratio of the ﬁrst
multipath component to that of the second one is about
4
2 = 2. In Figure 6, the receiver is moved to a closer
location that is 1.45 meters away from the transmitter. Now
the amplitude ratio becomes 7
0.5 = 14.

C. Theoretical Analysis
In this section, we ﬁrst give the mathematical model of the
received signal amplitude, and then show the performance
of the proposed authentication approach in terms of the
probability of false negative (i.e., the attacker’s signal is
incorrectly identiﬁed as the primary user’s signal) and the
probability of false alarm (i.e., the primary user’s signal is
incorrectly identiﬁed as the attacker’s signal).
1) Signal Amplitude Model: According to the simpliﬁed
path loss model [14], the amplitude Pr of a received signal
can be modeled as
Pr =( qPtk( d0
√Ptk
d )γ
d > d0,
d ≤ d0,
(2)
where Pt is the transmit power, d is the length of the path
along which the signal propagates from the transmitter to the
receiver (d > d0), k is a scaling factor whose value depends
on the antenna characteristics and the average channel atten-
uation, d0 is a reference distance for the antenna far-ﬁeld,
and γ is the path loss exponent. The values of k, d0, and γ
can be obtained either analytically or empirically [14].
2) Mathematical Analysis: We derive the probability of
false negative and the probability of false alarm in Lemmas 2
and 3, respectively.
Lemma 2: (Probability of false negative) Given a detec-
tion threshold w, the probability pd that the attacker’s signal
is wrongly identiﬁed as the primary user’s signal is
pd =
1
2
(1 − erf (
2
γ −1)√d
T1c
10 log (w
σ√2
)),
(3)
where erf is the Error Function, d is the distance between
the attacker and the helper node, c is the propagation speed
of electromagnetic wave, and σ and T1 are parameters that
typically range between 2 − 6dB and 0.1 − 1 microsecond,
respectively.
Proof: Let da1 and da2 be the lengths of the path
along which the ﬁrst and the second received multipath
components of the attacker travels, respectively. Let Pra1
and Pra2 be the amplitudes of the ﬁrst and the second
multipath components, respectively. Assume da1 > d0 and
da2 > d0. Thus, according to Equation 2, Pra1 and Pra1
can be approximated by
Pra1 =rPtak(
d0
da1
)γ,
Pra2 =rPtak(
d0
da2
)γ,
where Pta is the transmit power of the attacker. Hence, the
ratio ra of Pra1 to Pra2 can be written as
da1
ra = qPtak( d0
qPtak( d0
da2
)γ
)γ
=r(
da2
da1
)γ .
The attacker’s signal is wrongly identiﬁed as the primary
user’s signal if ra ≥ w. Thus, pd = 1 − P(ra  d0. Let Prp1 and Prp2 be the
