When creating the npz file, each array is written to a temporary file before
adding to a zip archive:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/lib/npyio.py#L601
This means that if /tmp is close to full, npz file creation will fail even
when the actual target device has plenty of space. Even worse, it fails with a
cryptic IOError message that doesn't point to /tmp.
