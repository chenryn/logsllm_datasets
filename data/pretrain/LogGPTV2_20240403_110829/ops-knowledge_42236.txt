User: lets say i have a python programm whitch i want to run always max 10 times in parallel using celery / rabbigmq and if some of the process finish i want to know about it so i can start a new process. how can i do so? some examples would be nice
Assistant: Giving an example is difficult as messaging is a bit complex, but what you can do basically is:

rewrite your program to be a task or write a task that calls your program using subprocess
configure celery to have 10 workers
execute as many tasks as you need to get your job done, Celery will add them to its queue
Celery will do the rest for you, once a task finished, another one is started till the queue is empty

Alternatively, if your want to start a task manually after one finished, you can configure Celery to send a message after its finished (I didn't try it yet, but have a look at CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND) You can then consume these messages and start your task.
