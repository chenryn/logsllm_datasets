It is true that Python 2.7 is natively included in macOS 10.8 and above. However, you have recently installed Python 3.5 for your projects at Udacity, only to find out that the courses use Python 2.7. Instead of attempting to uninstall Python 3.5, which can be a complex process, you chose to install Python 2.7 alongside it. You now use the IDLE and Shell for Python 2.7 when working on your Udacity assignments.

This approach is generally acceptable, but it's important to ensure that you do not mix up the versions. When invoking Python from the terminal or using it in scripts, make sure to specify the correct version. For example, you can use `python2.7` for Python 2.7 and `python3.5` for Python 3.5. Additionally, creating desktop shortcuts or aliases for each version can help you keep them organized and easily accessible.

To summarize, having both versions installed is fine, but take care to use the appropriate version for your specific tasks to avoid any potential issues.
