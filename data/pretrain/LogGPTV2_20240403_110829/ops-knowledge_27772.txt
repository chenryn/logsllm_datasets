User: Supposedly Python 2.7 is included native to OSX 10.8 and above (if I remember correctly), but I recently installed Python 3.5 to use for projects while I work through UDacity. Lo and behold, the UDacity courses seem to use 2.7 - wups! So instead of trying to uninstall 3.5 (this procedure seemed to scary for neophytes such as myself), I simply installed 2.7 in addition to the recently installed 3.5 and just run the 2.7 IDLE and Shell. Is this ok, or will I run into problems down the road?
Assistant: I have the same problem and it is not necessary to uninstall on version of python. Please take care to not mix them up - When you search them up on the start menu. You can make a desktop shortcut saying 2.6 and 3.5.
