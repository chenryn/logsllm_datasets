User: How to add third party python libraries in Google App Engine, which are not provided by Google? I am trying  to use BeautifulSoup in Google App Engine and unable to do so. But my question is for any library I want to use in Google App Engine.
Assistant: pip install -t lib package_name
lib: the location for third party libraries
Then you are good to use this package like a normal library you use from ipython or terminal.
