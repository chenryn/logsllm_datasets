**How to Add Third-Party Python Libraries in Google App Engine**

If you want to use third-party Python libraries in Google App Engine that are not provided by Google, such as BeautifulSoup, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install the Library Locally:**
   - Use `pip` to install the library and specify the target directory for the installation. For example, if you want to install `BeautifulSoup`, you would run:
     ```sh
     pip install -t lib beautifulsoup4
     ```
   - Here, `lib` is the directory where the third-party libraries will be stored. You can choose any name for this directory, but it's a common convention to use `lib`.

2. **Update Your `app.yaml` File:**
   - Ensure that your `app.yaml` file includes the `lib` directory in the `skip_files` section to prevent unnecessary files from being uploaded. Additionally, include the `lib` directory in the `pythonpath` environment variable so that your application can find the installed libraries.
     ```yaml
     runtime: python39  # or the appropriate Python version

     entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app

     handlers:
     - url: /.*
       script: auto

     env_variables:
       PYTHONPATH: 'lib'

     skip_files:
     - ^(.*/)?#.*#$  # Ignore .pyc files
     - ^(.*/)?.*~$  # Ignore editor backup files
     - ^(.*/)?.*\.py[co]$  # Ignore .pyc and .pyo files
     - ^(.*/)?.*/RCS/.*  # Ignore CVS directories
     - ^(.*/)?\..*$  # Ignore dotfiles
     - ^(.*/)?tests/?$  # Ignore test directories
     ```

3. **Use the Library in Your Code:**
   - Once the library is installed and the `app.yaml` file is updated, you can import and use the library in your code as you would in a regular Python environment.
     ```python
     from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

     # Example usage
     html_doc = "<html><body><h1>My First Heading</h1><p>My first paragraph.</p></body></html>"
     soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')
     print(soup.prettify())
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to use any third-party Python library in your Google App Engine application.
