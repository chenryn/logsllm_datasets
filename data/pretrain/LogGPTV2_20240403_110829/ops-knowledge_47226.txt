User: Would like to know what is the best F/OSS IDE for Python Web development.  I've always used vim myself, but I'm increasingly interested in having a tool that integrates syntax checking/highlighting, source control, debugging, and other IDE goodies.
I use both Windows and Linux as desktops, so recommendations for either platform are welcome!
Thanks,

Assistant: I am also working with mod_wsgi, python, apache software stack.  I am using WingIDE as my environment, which gives you debugging capabilities.  If you are vi person it has a VI/VIM personality which coupled with auto-completion makes for a very productive work environment.
