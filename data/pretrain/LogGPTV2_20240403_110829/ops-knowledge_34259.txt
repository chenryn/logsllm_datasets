User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why is Uchiwa not able to monitor the datacenter on CentOS7? This post combined with Install Sensu using YUM was used in order to install, configure and start Sensu and related services:

sudo yum install -y erlang &amp;&amp; \
sudo rpm -Uvh http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/v3.5.0/rabbitmq-server-3.5.0-1.noarch.rpm &amp;&amp; \
sudo yum install -y redis &amp;&amp; \
echo '[sensu]
name=sensu
baseurl=http://sensu.global.ssl.fastly.net/yum/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/sensu.repo &amp;&amp; \
sudo yum install -y sensu &amp;&amp; \
sudo yum install -y uchiwa &amp;&amp; \
for s in rabbitmq-server redis.service sensu-server sensu-api uchiwa; do sudo systemctl restart $s; done &amp;&amp; \
sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost /sensu &amp;&amp; \
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user sensu secret &amp;&amp; \
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /sensu sensu ".*" ".*" ".*"


Analysis


Navigating to :3000 shows the uchiwa dashboard and indicates Connection error. Is the Sensu API running?
/var/log/sensu/sensu-api.log indicates




{"timestamp":"2016-07-03T22:58:58.532905+0000","level":"warn","message":"config file does not exist or is not readable","file":"/etc/sensu/config.json"}

The config.json does not seems to exist (/etc/sensu/config.json: No such file or directory)
Downloading the example config.json and restarting the sensu-api did not solve the issue




{
  "rabbitmq": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "vhost": "/sensu",
    "user": "sensu",
    "password": "secret"
  },
  "redis": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 6379,
    "password": "secret"
  }
}





the redis port is listening:




LISTEN     0      128    127.0.0.1:6379                     *:*





the rabbitmq port as well:




LISTEN     0      100          *:4567                     *:* 



Uchiwa cannot connect to the datacenters




{
  "sensu": [
    {
      "name": "Site 1",
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 4567,
      "timeout": 10
    },
    {
      "name": "Site 2",
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 4567,
      "ssl": false,
      "path": "",
      "user": "",
      "pass": "",
      "timeout": 10
    }
  ],
  "uchiwa": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 3000,
    "refresh": 10
  }
}

{"timestamp":"2016-07-03T23:34:32.991492978Z","level":"warn","message":"Connection failed to the datacenter Site 2"}





navigating to &lt;IPADDRESS&gt;:4567 results in:




{"error":"redis and transport connections not initialized"}





redis replies




sudo redis-cli ping
PONG





redis password was set, but the issue persists




sudo redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379&gt; auth secret
OK

Assistant: I first got RabbitMQ working when I set up correct SSL config in rabbitmq.json, it shows an example on the Sensu Website. 
After that it only said: "error": "not connected to redis"

I then got Redis working by changing from "localhost" in the sensu config to "127.0.0.1". 
Since Redis wasn't listening on IPv6 and "localhost" resolved both ::1 &amp; 127.0.0.1 it didn't work properly. 

This was a fresh install on Debian 8.
