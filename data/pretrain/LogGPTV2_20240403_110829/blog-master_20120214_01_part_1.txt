## 背景    
当你管理的服务器越来越多的时候, 哪个服务器才是你最需要关注的?  
通过各个监控维度的排行, 可以知道你到底需要关注或者优先关注哪些服务器.  
这个通过nagios,cacti等监控软件当然是可以做到的.  
不过不太灵活, 因为服务器的配置各不一样, 关注的维度也不一样, PostgreSQL数据库的递归调用和窗口函数可以很好的运用来输出各种各样的统计数据, 有了数据也就利于展现了。  
## 本文测试环境 :   
```  
OS : RHEL5  
DB : PostgreSQL 9.1.2  
```  
假设我这里有1000台跑了mongoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL等数据库的服务器需要将它们的SAR报告集中到一台PostgreSQL数据库中.  
集中之后对报告进行分析, 找出需要关注的服务器来.   
## 一、首先看看我们要收集什么信息 :   
我这里举了一个简单的例子, 收集前一天sar的统计报告. 如下 :   
1\. sar -b  
反映系统的每秒读写IO请求等, 详情  
```  
       -b     Report I/O and transfer rate statistics.  The following values are displayed:  
              tps  
                     Total number of transfers per second that were issued to physical devices.  A transfer is an  I/O  
                     request to a physical device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request  
                     to the device.  A transfer is of indeterminate size.  
              rtps  
                     Total number of read requests per second issued to physical devices.  
              wtps  
                     Total number of write requests per second issued to physical devices.  
              bread/s  
                     Total amount of data read from the devices in blocks per second.  Blocks are equivalent  to  sec-  
                     tors  with  2.4  kernels  and newer and therefore have a size of 512 bytes. With older kernels, a  
                     block is of indeterminate size.  
              bwrtn/s  
                     Total amount of data written to devices in blocks per second.  
```  
2\. sar -B  
反映每秒系统写入或从磁盘读出的page数, 详情  
```  
       -B     Report paging statistics. The following values are displayed:  
              pgpgin/s  
                     Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk  per  second.   Note:  With  old  kernels  
                     (2.2.x) this value is a number of blocks per second (and not kilobytes).  
              pgpgout/s  
                     Total  number  of  kilobytes  the  system  paged  out to disk per second.  Note: With old kernels  
                     (2.2.x) this value is a number of blocks per second (and not kilobytes).  
              fault/s  
                     Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per  second  (post  2.5  kernels  only).  
                     This  is  not  a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some page faults can be resolved  
                     without I/O.  
              majflt/s  
                     Number of major faults the system has made per second, those which have required loading a memory  
                     page from disk (post 2.5 kernels only).  
```  
3\. sar -c  
反映系统每秒创建的进程数, 如果这个数字很大可能是应用程序连接数据库是短连接, 并且请求数据库频繁, 而PostgreSQL采用的是客户端连接过来fork新进程然后这个新进程与客户端进行交互的模式, 因此这种情况会造成数据库服务器大量的关闭和创建进程, sar -c能反映这种情况. 使用短连接还有一个坏处就是当系统中使用到sequence, 并且这个sequence被大量的这种短连接进程请求, 那么它设置的sequence cache没有效果并且会造成大量的跳号.  
详情  
```  
       -c     Report process creation activity.  
              proc/s  
                     Total number of processes created per second.  
```  
4\. sar -q  
反映系统的负载, 详情  
```  
       -q     Report queue length and load averages. The following values are displayed:  
              runq-sz  
                     Run queue length (number of processes waiting for run time).  
              plist-sz  
                     Number of processes and threads in the process list.  
              ldavg-1  
                     System load average for the last minute.  
              ldavg-5  
                     System load average for the past 5 minutes.  
              ldavg-15  
                     System load average for the past 15 minutes.  
```  
5\. sar -r  
反映系统的内存和SWAP的使用情况, 详情  
```  
       -r     Report memory and swap space utilization statistics.  The following values are displayed:  
              kbmemfree  
                     Amount of free memory available in kilobytes.  
              kbmemused  
                     Amount  of  used  memory  in kilobytes. This does not take into account memory used by the kernel  
                     itself.  
              %memused  
                     Percentage of used memory.  
              kbbuffers  
                     Amount of memory used as buffers by the kernel in kilobytes.  
              kbcached  
                     Amount of memory used to cache data by the kernel in kilobytes.  
              kbswpfree  
                     Amount of free swap space in kilobytes.  
              kbswpused  
                     Amount of used swap space in kilobytes.  
              %swpused  
                     Percentage of used swap space.  
              kbswpcad  
                     Amount of cached swap memory in kilobytes.  This is memory that once was swapped out, is  swapped  
                     back in but still also is in the swap area (if memory is needed it doesn’t need to be swapped out  
                     again because it is already in the swap area. This saves I/O).  
```  
6\. sar -R  
反映每秒被free的内存, 新增给buffer的内存, 新增给cache的内存. 详情  
```  
       -R     Report memory statistics. The following values are displayed:  
              frmpg/s  
                     Number of memory pages freed by the system per second.  A negative value represents a  number  of  
                     pages  allocated  by  the  system.   Note that a page has a size of 4 kB or 8 kB according to the  
                     machine architecture.  
              bufpg/s  
                     Number of additional memory pages used as buffers by the system per  second.   A  negative  value  
                     means fewer pages used as buffers by the system.  
              campg/s  
                     Number  of additional memory pages cached by the system per second.  A negative value means fewer  
                     pages in the cache.  
```  
7\. sar -u  
反映系统CPU在user, nice, system, iowait, steal, idle的分配比例. 详情  
```  
       -u     Report CPU utilization. The following values are displayed:  
              %user  
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application).  
              %nice  
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority.  
              %system  
                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel).  
              %iowait  
                     Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk  
                     I/O request.  
              %steal  
                     Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hyper-  
                     visor was servicing another virtual processor.  
              %idle  
                     Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk  
                     I/O request.  
              Note: On SMP machines a processor that does not have any activity at all (0.00 for  every  field)  is  a  
              disabled (offline) processor.  
```  
8\. sar -v  
inode, file 或其他内核表的报告, 详情  
```  
       -v     Report status of inode, file and other kernel tables.  The following values are displayed:  
              dentunusd  
                     Number of unused cache entries in the directory cache.  
              file-sz  
                     Number of used file handles.  
              inode-sz
