ask, is the deployment of S*BGP path validation worth the
extra eﬀort? (That is, is the juice worth the squeeze?)
To answer this question, we must contend with the fact
that any deployment of S*BGP is likely to coexist with
legacy insecure BGP for a long time. (IPv6 and DNSSEC,
for example, have been in deployment since at least 1999 and
2007 respectively.) In a realistic partial deployment scenario,
an autonomous system (AS) that has deployed S*BGP will
sometimes need to accept insecure routes sent via legacy
BGP; otherwise, it would lose connectivity to the parts of
the Internet that have not yet deployed S*BGP [33]. Most
prior research has ignored this issue, either by assuming that
ASes will never accept insecure routes [6, 11], by studying
only the full deployment scenario where every AS has al-
ready deployed S*BGP [10, 22], or by focusing on creating
incentives for ASes to adopt S*BGP in the ﬁrst place [11,19].
We consider the security beneﬁts provided by partially-
deployed S*BGP vis-a-vis those already provided by ori-
gin authentication. Fully-deployed origin authentication is
lightweight and already does much to improve security, even
against attacks it was not designed to prevent (e.g., prop-
agation of bogus AS-level paths) [22]. We ﬁnd that, given
the routing policies that are likely to be most popular dur-
ing partial deployment, S*BGP can provide only meagre
improvements to security over what is already possible with
origin authentication; we ﬁnd that other, less popular poli-
cies can sometimes provide tangible security improvements.
(“Popular” routing policies were found using a survey of 100
network operators [18].) However, we also show that secu-
rity improvements can come at a risk; complex interactions
between BGP and S*BGP can introduce new instabilities
and vulnerabilities into the routing system.
1.1 Security with partially-deployed S*BGP.
With BGP, an AS learns AS-level paths to destination
ASes (and their IP preﬁxes) via routing announcements from
neighboring ASes; it then selects one path per destination
by applying its local routing policies. Origin authentication
ensures that the destination AS that announces a given IP
preﬁx is really authorized to do so. S*BGP ensures that the
AS-level paths learned actually exist in the network.
In S*BGP partial deployment, security will be profoundly
aﬀected by the routing policies used by individual ASes, the
AS-level topology, and the set of ASes that are secure (i.e.,
have deployed S*BGP). Suppose a secure AS has a choice
between a secure route (learned via S*BGP) and an inse-
cure route (learned via legacy BGP) to the same destina-
tion. While it seems natural that the AS should always
prefer the secure route over the insecure route, a network
operator must balance security against economic and per-
formance concerns. As such, a long secure route through a
costly provider might be less desirable than a short insecure
route through a revenue-generating customer. Indeed, the
BGPSEC standard is careful to provide maximum ﬂexibil-
ity, stating the relationship between an AS’s routing policies
and the security of a route “is a matter of local policy” [33].
While this ﬂexibility is a prerequisite for assuring opera-
tors that S*BGP will not disrupt existing traﬃc engineering
or network management polices 1, it can have dire conse-
quences on security. Attackers can exploit routing policies
that prioritize economic and/or length considerations above
security.
In a protocol downgrade attack, for example, an
attacker convinces a secure AS with a secure route to down-
grade to a bogus route sent via legacy BGP, simply because
the bogus route is shorter, or less costly (Section 3.2).
1.2 Methodology & paper roadmap.
Three routing models.
In Section 2 we develop models
for routing with partially-deployed S*BGP, based on classic
models of AS business relationships and BGP [16,17,24–26].
Our security 1st model supposes that secure ASes always
prefer secure routes over insecure ones; while this is most
natural from a security perspective, a survey of 100 network
operators [18] suggests that it is least popular in partial
In our security 2nd model, a secure route is
deployment.
