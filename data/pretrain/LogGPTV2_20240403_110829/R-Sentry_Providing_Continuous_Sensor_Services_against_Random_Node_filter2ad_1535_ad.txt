### The Impact of Failure Period and Failure Percentage on Network Performance

#### Figures and Data Presentation
- **Figure 5** illustrates the effects of failure period (fp) and failure percentage (f%) on the average coverage loss time and 90% network lifetime. 
  - **(a) and (b)**: These subfigures show the impact of varying fp with a fixed f% of 5% and a fixed \(\lambda\) of 50 seconds.
  - **(c) and (d)**: These subfigures demonstrate the impact of varying f% with a fixed fp of 5000 seconds and a fixed \(\lambda\) of 50 seconds.

- **Figure 6** evaluates the scalability and the impact of grid size on the 90% network lifetime.
  - **(a)**: Compares the 90% network lifetime for R-Sentry and PEAS as the number of nodes increases.
  - **(b)**: Examines the effect of different grid sizes (G1: 1x1m², G5: 5x5m²) on the 90% network lifetime for R-Sentry and PEAS.

#### Observations and Analysis

- **Fault Tolerance**: Sensor nodes can fail before their energy is depleted. In this experiment, we evaluated the robustness of R-Sentry and PEAS under the catastrophic failure model.
  - **Figures 5(a) and (b)**: With f% fixed at 5%, R-Sentry, which uses sentry nodes to guard active nodes and dynamically adjusts schedules, shows high resilience against random node failures. R-Sentry can replace a failed active node within about 50 seconds, whereas PEAS has a much longer service loss period. This results in a significantly better 90% network lifetime for R-Sentry across all failure rates.
  - **Figures 5(c) and (d)**: When fp is fixed at 5000 seconds and f% varies, R-Sentry consistently outperforms PEAS in terms of 90% network lifetime.

- **Energy Efficiency and Scalability**: Deploying more sensor nodes can extend the network's operational lifetime. We varied the number of sensor nodes to measure the 90% network lifetime.
  - **Figure 6(a)**: R-Sentry provides a 30% longer 90% network lifetime compared to PEAS. This is due to R-Sentry's efficient scheduling, which maintains good coverage for a longer duration. The 90% lifetime in R-Sentry scales almost linearly with the number of nodes, and the performance gap between R-Sentry and PEAS increases with the number of nodes.
  - **Figure 6(b)**: Increasing the grid size from 1x1m² (G1) to 5x5m² (G5) further extends the 90% network lifetime by 30%. However, excessively large grids can compromise connectivity due to low density of active nodes. PEAS, which does not use grids, shows no significant change in performance with different grid sizes.

- **Connectivity**: Both R-Sentry and PEAS achieve over 95% packet delivery ratio during the 90% network lifetime, confirming their reliability. Due to space limitations, these results are not shown in the figures.

### Discussion

- **Energy Overhead of R-Sentry**: R-Sentry ensures fault tolerance by timely waking up appropriate redundant nodes, but this incurs additional energy overhead due to extra message exchanges. For example, with 2000 nodes and 1x1m² grids, each node wakes up 75 times and receives 16 replies per wake-up, resulting in 1200 reply packets. The energy consumption for these operations is approximately 0.765 Joules, which is less than 2% of the initial energy level. Therefore, the energy overhead of R-Sentry is considered low.

- **Impact of Grid Size**: Larger grid sizes generally lead to longer lifetimes because fewer active nodes are needed to cover all grid points. A 5x5m² grid (G5) extends the 90% network lifetime by 30% compared to a 1x1m² grid (G1). However, excessively large grids can reduce connectivity due to low node density. PEAS, which does not use grids, is not affected by grid size changes.

### Concluding Remarks

- **Continuous, Uninterrupted Service**: Ensuring continuous sensor services requires quick recovery from coverage loss due to node failures. R-Sentry addresses this by grouping redundant nodes into "gangs" that collectively replace an active node and scheduling these gangs at fixed intervals. This approach, along with considerations for realistic network conditions, enhances resilience and prolongs network lifetime.

- **Significance of R-Sentry**: Through detailed simulations, R-Sentry has demonstrated superior fault tolerance and energy efficiency, making it a significant step towards building reliable sensor services.
