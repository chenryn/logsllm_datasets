Figure 6. Scalability and impact of grid size
sor network function for a much longer period, as shown in
Figure 4(d). The interesting phenomenon we observe from
Figure 4(d) is that the 90% network lifetime stays almost the
same as (cid:1) goes up. This can be explained by the fact that,
though a large (cid:1) can save more energy by making redun-
dant nodes sleep longer, the likelihood of the overall cov-
erage ratio falling below a certain percentage (90% in this
case) is also higher due to oversleeping. As a result, these
two effects will cancel each other.
Fault Tolerance: It’s not unusual that sensor nodes die be-
fore running out of energy [6, 16, 1].
In this set of ex-
periments, we evaluate the robustness of the two schemes
against node failures under the catastrophic failure model.
In Figures 5(a) and (b), we (cid:2)xed f% as 5%, and varied
the value of fp. Since R-Sentry has sentry nodes guarding
active nodes and can dynamically adapt an active’s node
schedule table to accommodate the failures of its redundant
nodes, it is rather robust against random node failures. Fig-
ure 5(a) shows that, regardless of the failure rate, R-Sentry
is able to replace a failed active node around 50 seconds
(which is the value of (cid:1)). On the other hand, in PEAS,
the average service loss period is much longer. As a result,
R-Sentry provides a much better 90% network lifetime than
PEAS across all the failure rates (shown in Figure 5(b)). We
also observe the similar trend from the results when we (cid:2)x
fp but vary f%, which are shown in Figures 5(c) and (d).
Energy Ef(cid:2)ciency and Scalability: Many sensor applica-
tions seek to achieve longer network lifetime by deploying
more nodes. Therefore, the ability to translate a larger num-
ber of sensor nodes into a prolonged network lifetime is
critically important to node scheduling algorithms like R-
Sentry and PEAS. In this set of experiments, we varied the
number of sensor nodes, and measured the resulting 90%
lifetime. The results, reported in Figure 6(a), show that
R-Sentry leads to longer lifetimes than PEAS by roughly
30%. This is because R-Sentry maintains a good coverage
ratio for a much longer duration than PEAS through careful
scheduling, which leads to a better 90% lifetime. In fact, we
(cid:2)nd that the 90% lifetime in R-Sentry almost scales linearly
with the number of nodes, and that the difference between
the two schemes increases with the number of nodes.
Connectivity: Our simulations also show that, both algo-
rithms achieve more than 95% packet delivery ratio during
90% lifetime, which con(cid:2)rms our claim in Section 2.1. Due
to space limitation, we didn’t include these plots.
5.6. Discussion
Energy Overheard of R-Sentry: The ability to timely
wake up appropriate redundant nodes ensures R-Sentry’s
fault-tolerance. However on the other hand, it also entails
additional energy overhead by requiring extra message ex-
changes between nodes. Assuming no packet loss, when a
redundant node wakes up, it will send out a probing mes-
sage, and will receive n reply messages, where n is smaller
than the number of active nodes at the moment. To better
understand the overhead, let us next look at one example
scenario. We assume 2000 nodes and 1 (cid:2) 1m2 grids, and
we further assume that each node on average wakes up 75
times during the 90% lifetime and receives 16 replies dur-
ing each wake up (with a total of 1200 reply packets). Ac-
cording to our simulation traces, these numbers are rather
conservative. Given the power speci(cid:2)cations in Table 4, the
amount of energy consumed in transmitting the aforemen-
tioned scheduling related packets would be:
(75 + 1200) (cid:3) (25 (cid:3) 8=20000) (cid:3) 0:06 = 0:765 Joules
which is less than 2% of the initial energy level. Therefore,
we take the viewpoint that the energy overhead of R-Sentry
is rather low.

plays a role in R-Sentry: larger size usually leads to longer
lifetime since fewer active nodes are needed to cover all
the grid points, which we con(cid:2)rmed through experiments.
Speci(cid:2)cally, we adopted two grid sizes: 1(cid:2)1m2, referred to
as G1 and 5(cid:2)5m2, referred to as G5. The results are shown
in Figure 6(b). We can see that the 90% network lifetime of
R-Sentry can be further improved by the system adopting
a larger grid size. In fact, a grid size of 5 (cid:2) 5m2 extends
the lifetime by 30%. However, excessively large grid would
compromise connectivity since the network would be dis-
connected due to low density of active nodes. On the other
hand, since PEAS does not rely on the concept of grids, its
performance is not in(cid:3)uenced by the grid size. We would
like to point out that the inconsistency between G1 and G5
in the case of PEAS is caused by artifacts of the simulations.
6. Concluding Remarks
Providing continuous, uninterrupted sensor services re-
quires the network to be able to quickly recover from cov-
erage loss due to frequent node failures. That is, if an active
node fails, its coverage should be quickly resumed by the
redundant nodes, which were sleeping to conserve energy.
Earlier node scheduling solutions, such as PEAS [16], adopt
completely random schedules among redundant nodes. A
random schedule cannot guarantee a redundant node will
wake up timely when the active node fails, nor can it guar-
antee the redundant node that happens to wake up can fully
recover the coverage hole.
R-Sentry addresses these issues by grouping redundant
nodes into (cid:147)gangs(cid:148), which collectively can fully replace
an active node, and then by scheduling gangs with (cid:2)xed
intervals. R-Sentry also takes into consideration realis-
tic network situations, such as cases where a redundant
node serves multiple active nodes, or cases where redundant
nodes may fail before the active node. Through detailed
simulations, we show that R-Sentry can provide better re-
silience against failure while prolonging network life time.
As a result, R-Sentry has made a signi(cid:2)cant step towards
building reliable sensor services.
