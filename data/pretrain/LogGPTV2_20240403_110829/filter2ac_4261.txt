**ATT&CK ID:** C0022  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Operation Dream Job

In the Operation Dream Job campaign, the Lazarus Group employed a multi-stage attack strategy. Initially, victims were induced to download malicious DOTM files, which contained a VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro. Upon execution, this macro facilitated the next phase of the attack. Additionally, the group utilized Visual Basic macro code to extract a DLL implant that was double-encoded in Base64. This sophisticated approach allowed the attackers to evade detection and establish persistence on the compromised systems.
