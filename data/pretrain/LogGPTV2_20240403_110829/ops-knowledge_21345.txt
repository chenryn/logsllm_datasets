### Summary of the System Log Chunk

The provided system log contains 20 lines, each with a timestamp, log level, process ID, relevant software component, and log content. The log entries span from 18:10:44 to 18:10:49 on October 18th. Here is a step-by-step summary of the key issues and events:

1. **Address Change Detection**:
   - Multiple `WARN` logs indicate that an address change was detected for both the HDFS NameNode (port 9000) and the ResourceManager (RM) server (port 8030). The old address (`msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170`) has been updated to the new address (`msra-sa-41`).

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process is failing to renew the lease for the `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` client. This failure persists for 346 to 351 seconds. Each failure is logged as a `WARN` message, and the system indicates that it will retry shortly.

3. **ResourceManager Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process is unable to contact the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. This is logged as an `ERROR` message.
   - The system is retrying the connection to the RM server. The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between retries. The log shows that the system has already tried 0 times.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Log Levels**:
  - The log entries are recorded every second from 18:10:44 to 18:10:49.
  - Log levels include `WARN`, `INFO`, and `ERROR`.

- **Relevant Software Components**:
  - `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`
  - `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`
  - `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`

- **Log Content**:
  - **Address Change Detection**:
    - Example: `Address change detected. Old: msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000 New: msra-sa-41:9000`
  - **Lease Renewal Failure**:
    - Example: `Failed to renew lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1] for 346 seconds. Will retry shortly ...`
  - **ResourceManager Connection Retry**:
    - Example: `Retrying connect to server: msra-sa-41:8030. Already tried 0 time(s); retry policy is RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`
  - **Error in Contacting ResourceManager**:
    - Example: `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM.`

### Conclusion

The log chunk highlights two main issues:
1. An address change for the HDFS NameNode and ResourceManager, which is causing the system to detect and log these changes.
2. Repeated failures in lease renewal and ResourceManager communication, with the system attempting to retry these operations according to the specified retry policy.

These issues may indicate network instability or configuration changes that need to be addressed to ensure the proper functioning of the Hadoop cluster.
