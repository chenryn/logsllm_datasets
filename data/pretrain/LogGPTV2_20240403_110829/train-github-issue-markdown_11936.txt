### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.7.1
  * Operating System version: mac osx
  * Java version: 1.8
### Steps to reproduce this issue
I am using the newest dubbo and nacos,but when register to the nacos the
service only show in the [public] namespace,even if I assign the namesapce
name.
Will dubbo support this feature ? Nacos >= 0.8.0 has supported the namespace
params.
Thank you
