Hello,
I faced this issue: #24829 with DNS, and it ended up being a problem with my
**ServiceAccount** `secret` token that was **invalid**.
I had 3 secrets in my `kube-system` **ServiceAccount** for some reason.
I understand that when `secrets` are deleted, a new token is generated and
associated with the **ServiceAccount**.
I just don't understand how I ended up with 3 secrets, and how one (maybe 2?)
was invalid.
  * How are secrets invalidated?
  * How are they created besides when there are none? Is it on `apiserver` start? on `kubelet` start?
  * It's obviously possible to have multiple tokens for a service account, but how can this happen automatically?
When invalidated, shouldn't these automatically generated tokens also be
automatically removed from the **ServiceAccount**?
Thanks
