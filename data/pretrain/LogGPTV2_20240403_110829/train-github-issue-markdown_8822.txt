Often I'll have Code open and then try to open a new file either through
code.bat, "Open With Code", or even from the Start Menu and nothing will
happen. I assume this has been reported several times before, but couldn't
find anything as there are lots of issues reported here.
  * VSCode Version: 1.0.0
  * OS Version: 10.14335
Steps to Reproduce:  
Not 100% sure of the steps to get this to happen every time
  1. Have code running already with some files open (1 or more instances of it)
  2. Right click on a file and select `Open with Code`
  3. Nothing starts up - no additional `code.exe`s show up in Task Manager
![Task Manager when code is not working - only 1
window](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1149244/15053789/126e454a-12b9-11e6-9382-92cf2350672c.png)
If I then close all of the active Code windows and try again, things work.  
This means that I then lose my active files :(
