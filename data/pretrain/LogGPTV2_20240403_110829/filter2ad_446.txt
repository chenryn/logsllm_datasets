1 Introduction
In speciﬁcation-based detection the correct behavior of a system is modeled for-
mally and would be later veriﬁed during system operation for detecting anoma-
lies. In this paper we argue that comparing to anomaly and signature-based
approaches, speciﬁcation-based approach is an appropriate and precise way to
build IDSes for web applications. This is due to standardized nature of web archi-
tecture including protocols (HTTP, SOAP) and data formats (HTML, XHTML,
XML), which makes the challenging task of formal speciﬁcation feasible. In this
paper we propose a novel architecture based on ICAP protocol for a speciﬁcation-
based web application IDS, in which input parameters as well as the output
content of a web application are speciﬁed formally by regular expressions and
the IDS veriﬁes the speciﬁcation when users have interactions with the
application.
A more precise and comprehensive speciﬁcation makes the IDS engine more
powerful and increase the detection rate while decrease the false alarms. A cor-
rect speciﬁcation that exactly matches the real behavior of the system is very
important. If the speciﬁcation is so strict then some normal behavior of the sys-
tem may be detected as malicious activity and false positives arise. On the other
hand, If the speciﬁcation is so loose or general, then some abnormal behavior of
the system may be considered as normal activity and it causes false negatives.
Because of the variety of systems and normal behaviors, designing a general
speciﬁcation-based IDS with formal speciﬁcations of all normal activities is gen-
erally so complicated and imprecise. So researchers mainly focus on a speciﬁc
system or network protocol and try to formalize the speciﬁcations in order to
build a speciﬁcation-based IDS[1].
2 Formal Speciﬁcation of Web Applications
The standardized nature of web application protocols and data formats makes
the challenging work of speciﬁcation feasible. For building a speciﬁcation-based
IDS for a web application we propose to create the formal speciﬁcation in the
following areas:

– Input Parameters and Values: Each web application has a number of
input parameters. These input parameters and their associated valid values
can be identiﬁed from design or implementation documents or can be possi-
bly extracted by code analysis tool. To formally specify the input parameters
we can utilize various computation models used in computability theory such
as regular expressions, ﬁnite state machines or push-down automata.
– Output Content: By formal speciﬁcation of the output content and enforcing
this speciﬁcation on our IDS it is possible to detect and prevent attacks such as
cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL Injection and information leakages(directory
traversal, error pages, etc). Similar to speciﬁcation of input parameters, the
output content can be speciﬁed using various computation models.
3 Proposed Architecture
Our idea for building a speciﬁcation-based IDS is using the Internet Content
Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) as well as a middle proxy system such as Squid to
deliver the requests and responses to the IDS analysis engine. This idea maximize
the interoperability and minimize the implementation overhead of our proposed
architecture. This architecture allows the detection ans also prevention of attacks
on web applications (Fig.1). When a web client sends a request, the middle proxy
machine receives this request, encapsulates it in an ICAP request and sends it
the IDS analysis engine. The IDS analysis engine veriﬁes the correctness of the
request and either rejects it or forward it to the target web server. The correctness
of the responses is veriﬁed in the same way.
