User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题FTP Error 530, User cannot log in, home directory inaccessible I've been tasked with setting up an FTP directory for a client of ours. I'm working from a Windows 2008 Server with IIS 7 installed.

To create the FTP user directory I've followed this eHow tutorial.

The FTP site is already set up on IIS 7, so I skipped that bit and followed the rest exactly. However, when I try to connect via FileZilla, I get the following errors:


Status: Connecting to xxx.xx.xx.xx:21...
Status: Connection established, waiting for welcome message...
Response: 220 Microsoft FTP Service
Command: USER userFTP
Response: 331 Password required for userFTP.
Command: PASS ********
Response: 530 User cannot log in, home directory inaccessible.
Error: Critical error
Error: Could not connect to server


I've double checked the permissions of the user and everything appears to be as it should. If anyone has any advice, I'd be so grateful.

Assistant: I just hit this issue and for anyone googling the error would like to add the solution that worked on Windows Server 2012 IIS 8.0. It was very simple in the end you have to create a LocalUser folder in the FTP root you specified when creating the FTP site. Then create your username folders under this folder.

For e.g. D:\ftp-root\LocalUser\user1
