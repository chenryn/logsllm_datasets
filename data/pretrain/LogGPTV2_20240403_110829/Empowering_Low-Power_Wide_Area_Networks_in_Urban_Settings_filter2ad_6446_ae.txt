### 9.3 Extending Range of LP-WANs

In this experiment, we evaluate the potential of Choir in extending the range of low-power networks in urban settings.

**Method:**
We consider two or more nodes in our testbed, physically separated from the USRP base station by a given distance and transmitting identical data. Specifically, we focus on node locations where signals cannot reach the base station, even at the minimum data rate of LoRaWAN. We then progressively increase the number of sensors situated at randomly chosen positions in the testbed that collide at any time. The observed data is grouped based on the minimum distance between the colliding nodes and the base station. We measure two key metrics:
1. **Throughput**: Achieved by teams of these sensors in transmitting the desired data sequence as the number of sensors broadcasting identical data increases across a range of distances (and SNR) between the base station and clients.
2. **Maximum Distance**: Of the closest transmitter whose collisions were decodable when it collaborates using Choir with different numbers of other transmitters to reach the base station.

**Results:**
Figure 9(a) measures the throughput of various numbers of LoRaWAN clients coordinating to transmit a given data sequence to the base station. We selected these clients such that individually, their throughput to the base station is zero even at the lowest data rate. However, collectively, their throughput increases substantially, with teams of up to 30 nodes transmitting at data rates as high as 5470 bps. This improvement is due to the increased signal power received at the base station as larger teams of clients collide, allowing these clients to transmit at higher data rates.

Next, we study the impact of this on the range of the LP-WAN network. Figure 9(b) plots the maximum distance of the closest transmitter to the base station as it collaborates with teams of other transmitters to reach the base station. We observe that while one client in the network could reach at best a distance of 1 km—partly due to the tall buildings and hilly topography of the CMU campus as well as hardware limitations of the USRP’s receive chain [35]—teams of 30 clients using Choir could reach the base station even when the closest of them was 2.65 km away, an improvement of 2.65 times.

### 9.4 Exploiting Correlated Sensor Data

In this experiment, we evaluate Choir's ability to exploit the transmission of sensor data that is spatially correlated.

**Method:**
We leverage a testbed of sensor nodes placed in four different floors across two large buildings on the CMU campus (Figure 6 shows the sensor locations). Each sensor measures both temperature and humidity values in the room in which they are placed. We co-locate 36 LP-WAN radios with these sensors and transmit periodically at a rate of 1 reading per minute. We then measure the network throughput and resolution of the sensor data from the base station.

**Results:**
Figure 11(a) plots the mean percentage error of the observed sensor data against the true values for sensors grouped together using different strategies: randomly, by floor, and by relative distance from the center of the floor. We find that grouping by relative distance from the center of the floor is an excellent method. This is because the farther these sensors are from the center of the building, the closer they are to the outside temperature (or humidity).

Next, we evaluate the end-to-end performance of our system compared to the LoRaWAN baselines. Our system schedules transmissions from groups of sensors that are beyond the range of the LP-WAN base station, while allowing nearby sensor nodes to transmit data as they collect it. We apply Choir’s algorithms described in Section 7.2 to decode potential collisions and exploit correlation in sensor data to recover overlapping bits from groups of sensors that are beyond the base station’s range. Figure 11(b) measures the network throughput of observed sensor data for Choir and the baseline systems. Our system has a gain of 29.3377× over LoRaWAN+ALOHA and 5.609× over the LoRaWAN+Oracle baseline.

Finally, we examine how the resolution of observed sensor data from sensors beyond communication range varies with their distance to the base station. Figure 10 plots the mean percentage error of the recovered sensor data across an increasingly large group of sensors as we vary their distance to the base station (relative to the closest sensor). As expected, we observe a gradual decrease in resolution with distance, with an error of 13.2% for teams of up to 30 sensors at a distance of at least 2.5 km from the base station. Despite the loss in resolution, Choir is far superior to the baseline systems, where all of these nodes would be beyond the communication range of the base station.

### 9.5 Effect of Multiple Antennas

We evaluate the performance of Choir relative to MU-MIMO for a base station with 3 antennas. Figure 12 plots the network throughput of a team of 5 sensors transmitting data to the base station using:
1. Only one receiver antenna and LoRaWAN+ALOHA.
2. Only one receiver antenna and LoRaWAN+Oracle.
3. All three antennas and uplink MU-MIMO.
4. Choir using only one receiver antenna.
5. Choir run on all three antennas and averaging results.

We observe that while MU-MIMO’s gain over standard LoRaWAN is capped at 9.994× (3.04×) vs. LoRaWAN (+Oracle), Choir, even with a single antenna, achieves a gain of 11.07× (3.37×). Further, the presence of multiple antennas can improve Choir’s gain to 13.8489× (4.217×), demonstrating that its gains are complementary to MU-MIMO.

### 10. Conclusion

This paper presents Choir, a system that improves the throughput and range of low-power wide area networks in urban environments. Choir proposes a novel approach that exploits the natural hardware offsets between low-power nodes to disentangle collisions from several LP-WAN transmitters using a single-antenna LP-WAN base station. Additionally, Choir allows teams of LP-WAN sensor nodes with correlated data to reach the base station, despite being individually beyond communication range. Our system is implemented and deployed on a large outdoor testbed spanning 10 km² around the CMU campus.
