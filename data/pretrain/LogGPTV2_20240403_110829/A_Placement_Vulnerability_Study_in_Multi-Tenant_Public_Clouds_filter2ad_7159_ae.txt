### Co-Residency Analysis in Cloud Environments

#### Figure 16: Chances of Co-Residency with Varying Delays
**Description:**
- This figure illustrates the probability of co-residency between victim and attacker instances on GCE and EC2, with varying time lags.
- Solid boxes represent simultaneous launches (zero delay), while gauze-like boxes indicate a one-hour delay.
- No co-resident instances were observed for zero-delay runs on EC2.
- The results are from a single data center region (EC2: us-east, GCE: us-central1-a, Azure: East US).
- Each run configuration was repeated at least nine times, with at least three runs per time of day.

**Results:**
- **GCE:**
  - Zero Delay: Mean = 0.6, S.D. = 1.38, Min = 0, Median = 0.92, Max = 3.57
  - One Hour Delay: Mean = 1.07, S.D. = 2.59, Min = 0, Median = 0, Max = 3.5
- **EC2:**
  - Zero Delay: No co-resident instances observed.
  - One Hour Delay: Mean = 0.30, S.D. = 0.88, Min = 0, Median = 0, Max = 0.86

#### Figure 17: Distribution of Co-Resident Pairs and Success Rate
**Description:**
- This figure shows the distribution of co-resident pairs and the success rate for shorter delays under a 20x20 run configuration on EC2.
- A delay of "0+" indicates sequential launches, where attacker instances were launched only after all victim instances were running.
- Results are averaged over nine runs, with three runs per time of day.

**Observations:**
- Non-zero delays on GCE and zero delays on Azure increase the chance of co-residency, benefiting attackers.
- On Azure, the average delay between VM launches was 3 hours, with a maximum of 10 hours due to the leap-frog experimental methodology.
- Higher delays were more common in runs with a larger number of instances, as there were more false positives requiring a separate sequential phase to resolve (see Section 4.2).

#### Figure 18: Chances of Co-Residency Over Long Periods
**Description:**
- This figure examines the probability of co-residency over extended periods, with delays up to 32 hours.
- Contrary to expectations, the chance of co-residency did not drop to zero even for high delays.
- Possible reasons include constant churn, where neighboring VMs on the victim's machine were terminated.
- The leap-frog methodology may interfere with VM placement, but an increased number of unique co-resident pairs suggests fresh co-residency over longer delays.

**Results:**
- Across nine runs over two weeks, with three runs per time of day.
- For 32-hour delays, only three runs were conducted.

#### Figure 19: Effect of Time of Day on Co-Residency
**Description:**
- This figure analyzes the effect of the time of day on the chances of co-residency when an attacker changes the launch time of their instances.
- Results are aggregated across all run configurations with a one-hour delay between victim and attacker launch times.
- All times are in Pacific Time (PT).

**Observations:**
- There is a slightly higher chance of co-residency if the attacker instances are launched in the early morning for EC2 and at night for GCE.

#### Figure 20: Median Number of Co-Resident Pairs Across Two Regions
**Description:**
- This figure compares the median number of co-resident pairs in smaller, less popular regions versus larger, more popular regions.
- Results are based on at least three runs per configuration.

**Observations:**
- Smaller, less popular regions have a higher chance of co-residency.
- At least one co-resident pair was placed in all runs in these regions.
- An anomaly was observed on EC2 in the us-west-1 region, with an unusually large number of co-resident instances, possibly due to an internal management incident.

#### Figure 21: Distribution of Co-Resident Instances per Host
**Description:**
- This figure shows the distribution of the number of co-resident instances per host on Azure.
- More than two VMs can be co-resident on the same host on both Azure and GCE, but not on EC2.
- In one run, 16 VMs were placed on a single host.

**Observations:**
- Self-co-resident instances (from the same account) were observed on GCE and Azure but not on EC2, except for the anomaly in us-west-1.

#### Other Observations
- Multiple VMs can be co-resident on the same host on Azure and GCE, but not on EC2.
- Self-co-resident instances were common on GCE and Azure but rare on EC2.
- The leap-frog methodology may affect VM placement, but it also revealed new co-resident pairs over longer delays.

This structured and detailed analysis provides insights into the factors affecting co-residency in cloud environments, which can inform security strategies and resource management practices.
