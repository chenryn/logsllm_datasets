User: Is it possible to programmatically retrieve any of the YAML parameters during run-time? Are they stored in the environment somewhere?
Good example would be to automatically find the application version and to add it as a comment in the landing HTML page.
Assistant: No, but some of the data is available from os.environ - for example, os.environ['APPLICATION_ID'], and os.environ['CURRENT_VERSION_ID'].
