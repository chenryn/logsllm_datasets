I know you can alter the darkness of the shadow cast based on the light
itself:  
light.shadowDarkness = 0.5;
but say i have objects with materials of various opacities:  
var material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial( { color : 0x000000, opacity:0.1}
);  
material.transparent = true;
all of the shadows are the same darkness. Is there any way for to make the
shadows adjust the darkness based on the shadow-casting objects opacity? (more
translucent objects cast a lighter shadow)
