User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Blocking IP addresses of obvious hack attempts I have a simple Apache webserver setup and basic IP tables (ufw) for a development server.  In my logs I see lines like this:

[Fri May 16 10:10:36.258369 2014] [:error] [pid 15926] [client 69.147.158.130:8396] script '/var/www/html/wp-login.php' not found or unable to stat


I am not running WordPress at all, and I realize this is a very minor attempt at a hack (there are much more sophisticated attacks against Apache out there).  However I would like to automatically block this IP address (temporarily) without installing an IDS/IPS such as Snort.

I am just looking for a simple way to block an address that tries to connect to wp-admin or wp-login.  Is there an Apache module that would handle something like this?

Assistant: While you are clearly asking for a solution to block IP addresses, I don't think that is a good solution.

The reason being that these attempts you see are coming from various IP addresses most likely controlled by one master system. That is simply the nature of how DDoS &amp; hacking attempts occur nowadays.

Instead, you should look into implementing ModSecurity. It's an Apache module that acts as a web service level firewall. It analyzes all web traffic coming to your site, and if it detects known aberrant behavior, access us blocked dead in it's tracks by a "403: Forbidden" response.

Now the slightly negative side is that MidSecurity has dozens of default rule sets that work well, but might cause false positives. So when you implement it you will most likely need to tweak it for the first few weeks.

But the net result is after this "getting to know you" period you will have a tool that heuristically protects your site from known bad behavior. And not just keep a list of IP addresses.
