PBX’s 
Why do people run PBX’s? 
•  Reduce Costs 
•  Cheap Calling 
•  "Apps”  
•  Voicemail 
•  IVR’s 
•  Conferencing 
•  Directories

How? 
Step 1) Figure out what you’re testing 
Testing 
Scope 
 Blackbox / Whitebox? 
Info Gathering 
Testing 
Info Gathering 
• OSINT 
• Grab Phone Numbers from Web / 
Directories.  
• Look for patterns 
• Port Scans  
• Shodan 
• Use the Web 
• Whois has information too! 
Externally Testing 
Testing Via POTS 
-  Regular Phone. Sit and press buttons 
-  Modems and AT commands 
-  Soft Phones 
-  Any of the major ones 
-  Ekiga, Twinkle ETC. 
-  Automatable / Scriptable  
-  SipCLI 
-  Sip.Js & JSSip 
-  MJSip 
-  Use a PBX

Types of Issues 2017 
A1:  Injection 
A2:  Broken Authentication and Session 
Management 
A3:  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
A4:  Broken Access Control 
A5:  Security Misconfiguration 
A6:  Sensitive Data Exposure 
A7:  Insufficient Attack Protection 
A8:  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
A9:  Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities 
A10:  Under protected APIs 
A1: Injection 
Injection Points: Web, Voice, SIP, DTMF 
Result: 
 XSS 
 SQL 
 Buffer Overflows 
 Log Contamination 
A2: Broken Authentication & Session Management 
Mostly Authentication 
Lack of SSL/TLS for SIP  
https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Secure+Calling+Tutorial 
A3: Cross-site Scripting 
Somewhat covered by injection 
A4: Broken Access Control 
http://example.com/app/accountInfo?
acct=notmyacct 
Given that example, this can be translated into a bad 
configuration. 
Either Extensions or AGI Script / App 
Related to A5 
A5: Security Misconfiguration 
•  Pretty common 
•  SIP allowguest – Default = yes 
•  4 Digit passwords for SIP Clients 
•  Conferencing 
•  Default passwords 
•  Weak Passwords 
•  Misconfigured Dial plans & AGI’s 
A6: Sensitive Data Exposure 
• Voicemail 
• Conference Calls 
• Information not available elsewhere 
• Similar to the User/Password 
combination enumeration 
• Corp Directories 
• Full Names, E-Mails 
• Schedules, out of office 
A7: Missing Function Level Access Control 
•  Caller ID Spoof 
•  User logs in, tries username / pass, fails tries 
another. 
•  Systems like voicemail that allow userid, 
password separate and prompt for username 
again is an issue 
•  Potential with misconfigurations, if put back 
into another context. 
•  Reasonable Use 
A8: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
• Vendors 
• Web portals and configuration pages are 
often vulnerable 
• In from a phone sense not directly 
applicable
