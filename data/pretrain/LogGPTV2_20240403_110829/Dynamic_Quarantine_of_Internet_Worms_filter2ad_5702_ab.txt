hosts, edge-routers, and at backbone routers. We develop a
mathematical model to reason about each deployment strat-
egy’s effectiveness, and conduct simulation experiments to
conﬁrm the model’s predictions.
5.1. Host-based rate limiting
Deploying rate limiting ﬁlters at individual hosts is sim-
ilar to rate limiting at the leaf nodes of a star topology as
described in Section 4. Again, let q be the percentage of
nodes that install the ﬁlter mechanism. x1 = I(1− q) is the
number of infected nodes that are not conﬁned by the ﬁlter
mechanism, and x2 = Iq is the number of infected nodes
with the ﬁlter mechanism. β1 is the contact rate of the in-
fected host without the ﬁlter, β2 is the contact rate allowed
by the ﬁlter, and β1 >> β2.
Similarly, we can use Equation (3) to model the time evo-
lution of infection. The solution to Equation (3) gives us
C + eλt
I/N = eλt
, where λ = qβ2 + (1 − q)β1
.= β1(1 − q). The analysis in Sec-
When β1 >> β2, λ
tion 4 on rate limiting on leaf nodes also holds here. Figure 2

Figure 2. Analytical model for rate limiting at individ-
ual hosts with β1 = 0.8 and β2 = 0.01
shows the time evolution of I with β1 = 0.8 and β2 = 0.01.
As we see in Figure 2, the deployment of host-based con-
ﬁnement mechanisms yields a linear slowdown in the infec-
tion rate of the worm. Note the difference between 80% de-
ployment and 100% deployment of rate limiting, this shows
that rate limiting has very little beneﬁt unless all end hosts
implement rate limiting.
Edge-router based deployment is similar to the host-
based rate limiting scheme. From the set of networks that
install the ﬁlter, we can calculate the effective q (percent-
age of nodes that install the ﬁlter mechanism) and the rest
of the calculation is the same.
When ﬁlters are installed at edge routers, worms propa-
gate much faster within the subnet than across the Internet.
We denote the contact rate within the subnet as β1 and the
contact rate across the Internet as β2. Clearly, β1 ≥ β2. For
a random propagation worm, the infection growth within
the subnet has the form x = eβ1 t
C1+eβ1 t , where x is the num-
ber of infected nodes within a particular subnet. The number
of subnets infected has a similar growth form y = eβ2 t
C2+eβ2t ,
where y is the number of infected subnets.
For worms that use a preferential targeting algorithm
(i.e., those that target nodes within the same subnet), the
growth formula stays the same except for that the infection
rate within the subnet, β1, could be substantially larger than
that of a random propagating worm. Consequently, the ef-
fectiveness of rate control at edge routers diminishes when
a worm employs an intelligent targeting algorithm such as
subnet preferential selection.
Figure 3 depicts the analytical models for both local pref-
erential connection and random propagation worms with
rate limiting ﬁlters at the edge routers. It shows the time
evolution of the percentage of hosts infected with β1 = 0.8
and β2 = 0.01. In the base case with no rate limiting, the in-
fection grows exponentially before it reaches its maximum
limit. With rate control there is a slight slowdown in the
rate of infection. As shown in Figure 3(a), our model indi-
cates that edge router rate limiting is more effective for the
random propagation model. To verify this, we created sim-
ulations to compare edge router rate limiting for both local
preferential and random propagation models. The results of
the simulations are shown in Section 5.4
5.3. Rate limiting at backbone routers
In this section we investigate rate limiting at the back-
bone routers of the Internet. In order for a worm to propa-
gate from one network to another, the worm packets need to
go through backbone routers on the Internet. Therefore, de-
ploying rate limiting mechanisms at the backbone routers
can help throttling worm propagation. We perform an ap-
proximate analysis of rate limiting at backbone routers be-
low.
If we deploy the rate limiting mechanism on the core
routers that cover α percent of the total IP-to-IP paths, then

Analytical Model for random and local preferential worms 
 within subnets with rate limiting (RL) on edge routers
In order to experiment with the different deployment
cases, we designate the top 5% and 10% of nodes with the
most number of connections as backbone and edge routers
respectively. The remaining nodes are end hosts. Rate lim-
iting is implemented by restricting the maximal number of
packets each link can route at each time tick and queuing
the remaining packets. In order to ensure that normal traf-
ﬁc gets routed, we assign each rate-controlled link a base
communication rate of 10 packets per second. We then com-
pute a link weight that is proportional to the number of rout-
ing table entries the link occupies. We multiply this weight
to the base rate to obtain the actual link rate simulated for
each link. We believe that this simulated routing will allow
most normal trafﬁc to be routed through since the most uti-
lized links will have a higher throughput.

where β is the contact rate of one infected host, δ =
min(Iβα, rN/232), and r is the average overall allowable
rate of the routers with the rate limiting control. When r
is relatively small, the right hand side of Equation 6 can
be approximated by only the ﬁrst term. We can thus obtain
I/N = eλt
c+eλt , where λ = β(1 − α) and c is a constant.
5.4. Simulation Results
The simulator that is used to conduct our experiments
is built on top of Network Simulator (ns-2) [4]. All exper-
iments in this section are conducted using an 1,000 node
power-law graph generated by BRITE [9]. The graph shares
similar characteristics to an AS topology such as the Ore-
gon router views. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, each simu-
lation is averaged over 10 individual runs. In addition, the
time units in all our simulations are simulation ticks as de-
ﬁned by ns-2.
We begin each simulation with a random set of initial
infections. At each time unit each infected node will at-
tempt to infect everyone else with infection probability β.
The infection packet is routed using a shortest path algo-
rithm through the network. Links that have the rate limiting
mechanism will only route packets at a rate of γ.
Figure 4. Simulation of rate limiting at end hosts, edge
routers and backbone routers.
Figure 4 shows the simulation results for random prop-
agation worms, for the cases of no rate limiting, rate lim-
iting at 5% of the end hosts, edge routers and backbone
routers. As shown, the simulation results conﬁrm our an-
alytical models in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. More speciﬁcally,
there is negligible difference between no rate limiting and
rate limiting at 5% of end hosts. While rate limiting at the
edge routers shows a slight improvement, rate limiting at the
backbone routers renders a substantial improvement. Com-
pared to the case of end host and edge router based rate lim-
iting, it takes approximately ﬁve times as long for the worm
to spread to 50% of all susceptible hosts if rate limiting is
implemented at the backbone routers.
Figure 5 shows the simulated propagations for rate lim-
iting at the edge router for both local preferential and ran-
dom propagation worms within subnets. The dotted lines
are the base cases (with no rate limiting) for local prefer-
ential and random worms respectively. As our simulations
show, there is very little perceivable beneﬁts for implement-
ing rate limiting at the edge routers if worms propagate
using a local preferential algorithm. For random propaga-
tion worms, however, rate control at the edge routers still
