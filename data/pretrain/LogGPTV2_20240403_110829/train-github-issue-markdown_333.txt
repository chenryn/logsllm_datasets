### Problem description
The `` component receives these props
    .MuiGrid-spacing-xs-16-1335 {
        width: calc(100% + 16px);
        margin: -8px;
    }
causing a horizontal scrollbar. See this question for a more accurate example
and the (unelegant) fix.
### Steps to reproduce
Create an empty project and create one `` with a single item inside.
Your page will have a horizontal scroll bar.
### Versions
  * Material-UI: beta 5
  * React: 15.6.1
  * Browser: Chrome 60
### Proposed solution
Only apply the spacing class and its variants on `` children. I suppose
this may be a little inconsistent in the case where you are nesting ``
containers, so an alternative could be to just have a prop like
`applySpacingToContainerOnly={true}` (default: `false`) or something?
