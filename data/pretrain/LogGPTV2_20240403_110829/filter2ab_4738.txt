**Technique Name:** Windshift

Windshift has employed several tactics to disguise malicious executables. One such method involves using icons that mimic Microsoft Office files, thereby misleading users into believing the files are legitimate.[45] Additionally, Windshift has attempted to conceal executables by changing their file extensions to ".scr," which is commonly associated with Windows screensavers, further obfuscating their true nature.[46]
