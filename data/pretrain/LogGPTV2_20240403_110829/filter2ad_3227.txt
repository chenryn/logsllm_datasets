Abstract
The  rapid  decrease  in  the  cost  of  computing  and  networks  has  made  fault  tolerance  much 
cheaper.  The  gradual  increase  in  the  IQ  of  system  designers  is  leading  to  a  switch  from 
programming  hacks  to  provably  fault-tolerant  algorithms.  These  developments  have  motivated 
the resumption of archaeological research on Paxos. Some lower-bound theorems have recently 
been dug up, along with algorithms that achieve them. Rigorous examination of the hypotheses 
of  these  theorems  have  led  to  more  efficient  algorithms  in  certain  interesting  cases.  Great 
excitement has been generated by a recently discovered parchment. There are indications that it 
was considered very significant by the Paxons. If it can be deciphered in time, its contents will 
be presented. 
Bio
Dr. Lamport received a doctorate in mathematics from Brandeis University, with a dissertation 
on singularities in analytic partial differential equations. This, together with a complete lack of 
education  in  computer  science,  prepared  him  for  a  career  as  a  computer  scientist  at 
Massachusetts Computer Associates, SRI, Digital, and Compaq. He claims that it is through no 
fault of his that of those four corporations, only the one that was supposed to be non-profit still 
exists.  He  joined  Microsoft  in  2001,  but  that  company  has  not  yet  succumbed.  Dr.  Lamport’s 
initial  research  in  concurrent  algorithms  made  him  well-known  as  the  author  of  LaTeX,  a 
document formatting system for the ever-diminishing class of people who write formulas instead 
of  drawing  pictures.  He  is  also  known  for  writing,  “A  distributed  system  is  one  in  which  the 
failure  of  a  computer  you  didn’t  even  know  existed  can  render  your  own  computer  unusable”, 
which established him as an expert on distributed systems. His greatest contribution to humanity 
is  Lamport’s  Law,  which  states  that,  to  a  first  approximation,  grinding  coffee  beans  does  not 
change  the  volume  that  they  occupy.  Among  his  other  contributions  is  the  TLA+  specification 
language,  which  represents  a  Quixotic  attempt  to  overcome  engineers’  antipathy  towards 
mathematics.  Dr.  Lamport  has  received  three  honorary  doctorates  from  European  universities. 
The  IEEE  is  sending  him  to  Italy  to  receive  the  Piore  Award.  He  has  not  taken  the  hint  and 
continues to return to his home in California.
