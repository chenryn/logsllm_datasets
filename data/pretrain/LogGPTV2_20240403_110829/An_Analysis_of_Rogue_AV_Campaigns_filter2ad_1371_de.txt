social network B. Again, we can identify this kind of fraudulent (or embellished)
proﬁles in an automated way by cross-correlating the information extracted during
crawling the different networks.
4 Evaluation with Real-World Experiments
We performed several experiments on different social networks. As a starting point,
we used a set of 10,427,982 e-mail addresses, which were left on a dropzone on a
compromised machine that was taken down by law enforcement ofﬁcials. Based on
the log ﬁles of this machines, we saw that these e-mail addresses had been used for
spamming, and thus, they provided a real-world test case for our system.

4.1 Results for E-Mail Queries
We used our Address Prober component on eight social networks, namely Facebook,
MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn, Friendster, Badoo, Netlog, and XING. These networks
were chosen because they provide a representative mix of different types of social net-
works (e.g., business, friendship, and dating). Furthermore, all of these sites have mil-
lions of registered users and operate in different countries. Of course, they also vary in
their popularity. Facebook, for example, is the most popular social networking site and
reports to have more than 400 million active users [15].

Table 1 shows the proﬁles that have been discovered by the e-mail queries that we
performed on these sites. Clearly, direct queries to the social networking sites yield
faster results than those that are coupled with GMail accounts. Also, while we were
able to query 5,000 e-mail addresses at once on Facebook, the best results for XING
were 500 addresses per query. The scan method and e-mail list length directly affect
the speed of the queries. In general, direct queries are about one order of magnitude
faster, and we can check several million e-mail addresses per day. For social networks
on which we need to use the GMail support, we can still probe several hundred thousand
addresses per day. Also, note that we only adopted a single machine in our tests, while
an attacker could perform such an attack in parallel using many machines. In total, we
were able to identify 1,228,644 proﬁles that are linked to one of the e-mail addresses
we probed. Most proﬁles were found on Facebook (4.96%), LinkedIn (2.36%), and
MySpace (2.01%).
Table 2 shows the number of proﬁles that were created with the same e-mail address
on different networks. For example, one can see that there are almost 200,000 users who
were registered in at least two social networks. In sum, a total of 876,941 unique e-mail
addresses we had access to were covered by one or more of the listed social networks.
Table 3 shows the top ten combinations among social networks. That is, the table
shows which combinations of networks we typically encountered when we identiﬁed
a user who is registered on different sites with the same e-mail address. The two most
popular combinations are Facebook with MySpace, and Facebook with LinkedIn. Note
that the more diverse information a social networking site offers about users as pub-
lic information, the more signiﬁcant our attack becomes. In the case of LinkedIn and

Facebook, we have two social networking sites with different goals. Whereas Face-
book aims to foster friendship, LinkedIn aims to foster business collaborations. Hence,
we can combine the business information about a user with the more personal, private
information they may provide on the friendship site (e.g., under a nickname).
These results of our experiment clearly demonstrates that a potential attacker can
easily abuse social networks to enrich his spamming list with the information retrieved
from different networks.
4.2 Extracted Information from Proﬁles
In this section, we provide statistics about the information collected when the Proﬁle
Crawler visited the user proﬁles. We present for each of the social networks an overview
of what kind of information is available, and also for what percentage of users we were
able to extract this information.
Table 4 provides an overview of general information such as proﬁle photo, location,
and friends available on the different networks. The column proﬁles are open shows the
percentage of how many proﬁles the crawler was able to access, and validate against the
name and surname already extracted from the Address Prober. Proﬁles that are closed
include proﬁles that are conﬁgured to be completely private, or that are not accessible

anymore. In Facebook, more than 99% of the proﬁles are open, but only little informa-
tion is shown by default to anonymous users and persons that are not a friend of the
user. On the contrary, the proﬁle photo and the list of friends are usually accessible.
Typically, the different pieces of information can be either private or public, and the
social network provider assigns a default value for the privacy setting of them. From
our observations, it seems that many users do not change the default privacy settings
for a speciﬁc type of information. Note that when some data is not accessible, it either
means that the user has not set such a value (it is optional) or that is not accessible due
to privacy reasons.
Table 5 shows the availability of sensitive information on the individual networks.
Depending on the purpose of the social network, different types of information are made
public by default. Dating platforms, for instance, focus on personal information such as
age, sex, or current relationship status, while business networks emphasize educational
and work-related aspects. However, all of these details are more sensitive and can be
used for the accurate proﬁling of an account. Precise values such age and sex can easily
be correlated across different social networks, essentially forming richer sets of publicly
available data than initially desired by the user. We provide a detailed overview of this
aspect in Section 4.4.

Finally, Table 6 shows what kind of additional information each social network sup-
ports. We refrain from providing a percentage for these ﬁelds, because this type of
information is only available for a minority of the sampled cases.
