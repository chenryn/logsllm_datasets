Abstract—We study moving-target defense (MTD) that ac-
tively perturbs transmission line reactances to thwart stealthy
false data injection (FDI) attacks against state estimation in
a power grid. Prior work on this topic has proposed MTD
based on randomly selected reactance perturbations, but these
perturbations cannot guarantee effective attack detection. To
address the issue, we present formal design criteria to select MTD
reactance perturbations that are truly effective. However, based
on a key optimal power ﬂow (OPF) formulation, we ﬁnd that
the effective MTD may incur a non-trivial operational cost that
has not hitherto received attention. Accordingly, we characterize
important tradeoffs between the MTD’s detection capability
and its associated required cost. Extensive simulations, using
the MATPOWER simulator and benchmark IEEE bus systems,
verify and illustrate the proposed design approach that for the
ﬁrst time addresses both key aspects of cost and effectiveness of
the MTD.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cyber attacks against critical infrastructures can lead to
severe disruptions. The December 2015 attack against the
Ukraine’s power grid was a real-world example, which caused
power outages for a large number of customers for hours [1].
These attacks were typically crafted by sophisticated attackers,
sometimes with national backing, who managed to spend
considerable time inside a system to learn its operational
details, and accordingly designed the injection of malicious
data/control to disrupt its operations [2]. It is thus imperative
to design counteracting defense approaches to defeat
the
knowledgeable attackers. Moving-target defense (MTD) [3] is
a defense approach that has received increasing attention. It
is based on dynamically changing the system parameters that
attackers need to target for customizing their attacks, in order
to invalidate the attackers’ prior knowledge of the system and
render ineffective any of their prior designed strategies. It has
the potential to make it extremely difﬁcult or impossible for
would-be attackers to keep up with the system dynamics.
In this paper, we focus on false data injection (FDI) attacks
against state estimation (SE) in power grids. SE is a key
method for grid operators to obtain a best estimate of the
system state from noisy sensor measurements collected via
a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system,

for example. Its output is used in critical applications such as
economic dispatch (for proﬁts) and contingency analysis (for
reliability). A bad data detector (BDD) associated with the
SE is often deployed for identifying bad data (e.g., sensor
anomalies and FDI attacks) to ensure trustworthy results.
However,
it has been shown [4] that FDI attacks crafted
using detailed knowledge of a power grid’s topology and the
reactance settings of its transmission lines can bypass the
BDD and remain stealthy. Such an undetected attack can have
severe consequences, e.g., trips of transmission line breakers
or unsafe frequency excursions [5], [6].
To strengthen the BDD, it has been shown that if a carefully
chosen subset of the sensors can be well protected (e.g., by
tamper-proof and encryption-enabled PLCs), or if a key subset
of the state variables can be independently and reliably veriﬁed
by phasor measurement units (PMUs) deployed at strategically
chosen locations, then a BDD-bypassing FDI attack becomes
impossible [7], [8], [9]. However, a major revamp of the basic
sensing infrastructure can be quite expensive (e.g., PMU has
high cost [10]) or infeasible for the many existing legacy
systems whose life cycles often last decades and which are not
expected to retire for the foreseeable future. Alternatively, FDI
attacks can be signiﬁcantly mitigated by MTD that invalidates
the knowledge attackers used for crafting their prior attacks,
speciﬁcally by active perturbation of the grid’s transmission
line reactance settings in our application context [11], [12],
[13]. This approach is practical because of current D-FACTS
devices capable of active impedance injection [14]. Because
of their low cost and ease and ﬂexibility of deployment, they
are being increasingly installed in existing alternating-current
(ac) transmission networks to control power ﬂows [15].
Prior work on MTD for FDI attacks against power grid
SE has two important limitations, which are related. First,
the MTD is implemented by selecting a random subset of
transmission lines and introducing similarly random pertur-
bations to their reactance settings [13]. There are no known
conditions for the MTD perturbations to be truly effective. An
important ﬁnding of this paper is that the randomly selected
perturbations do not necessarily guarantee effective detection.
Rather, a perturbation must satisfy certain design criteria that
we will make clear (in Section V), or FDI attacks crafted
using (outdated) system knowledge before the perturbation
will remain stealthy after it. Second, without an adequate
characterization of effective MTD, prior work has not been
able to address explicitly the associated cost involved. Rather,
it is assumed that the MTD can be always constrained to have
negligible or some “low enough” operational cost [13], [11].
However, MTD designed with any absolute cost constraints
will not be useful if the MTD does not perform. It is thus
critical to understand the inherent cost-beneﬁt tradeoff of the
MTD to accordingly inform system operators (SOs) in their
choice of security policies, which is a key objective of this
paper.
To achieve our goal, we analyze the problem of selecting
MTD reactance perturbations that jointly consider their effec-
tiveness (i.e., capability of attack detection) and operational
cost (i.e., economic inefﬁciency). As in prior work, we assume
that the attacker has learned the system conﬁguration initially
and uses this knowledge to craft stealthy FDI attack vectors,
but the attacker cannot track the reactance perturbations with-
out signiﬁcant delays. In this setting, large MTD perturbations
will cause the actual system to deviate signiﬁcantly from
the attacker’s prior knowledge, so that a large majority of
the previously stealthy FDI attacks will now likely become
detectable. Conversely, however, the large perturbations will
also cause the power grid to operate signiﬁcantly away from
the optimal state,
thereby incurring a signiﬁcantly higher
economic cost. On the other hand, smaller perturbations will
be less expensive, but risk more undetected attacks. The
general cost-beneﬁt tradeoff is thus interesting.
In this paper, we address the cost-beneﬁt tradeoff of the
MTD by formulating its perturbation selection as a constrained
optimization problem, namely minimization of the operational
cost subject to a given effectiveness constraint. The opera-
tional cost is quantiﬁed as the increment due to the MTD
over the cost achieved at optimal power ﬂow (OPF) of the
system without MTD. This cost is always non-negative. The
effectiveness is quantiﬁed as the fraction of prior stealthy
FDI attacks (i.e., those before the MTD perturbation) that
will become detectable by the BDD after the perturbation.
It is difﬁcult to give an exact analysis of the effectiveness.
We will instead employ a heuristic metric that effectively
invalidates the attacker’s knowledge required to bypass the
BDD. Extensive simulation results show that the heuristic
metric effectively approximates the true metric.
We use a direct-current (dc) power ﬂow model to approx-
imate power ﬂows in an alternating-current (ac) grid. This
approach is widely adopted and well justiﬁed in power system
research (e.g., [4], [7], [13]). Under the dc model, the OPF
cost corresponds mainly to the cost of generation dispatch.
Moreover, the sensor measurements are linearly related to the
system state through a measurement matrix, which in turn
depends on the power grid topology and the reactance of the
transmission lines. Naturally, perturbing a branch reactance
will alter the measurement matrix correspondingly. A key
observation in our analysis is that the MTD’s effectiveness
and operational cost are related to the separation between the
column spaces of the measurement matrices before and after
the MTD. While the effectiveness is enhanced by increasing
the separation between the two column spaces, the operational
cost increases. Therefore, different degrees of separation be-
tween the two spaces provide a spectrum of balance between
the two metrics.
We note that, in light of our deliberate cost analysis of the
MTD, the MTD can be viewed as a form of insurance against
possible FDI attacks. Such insurance requires an ongoing
payment of “premiums” irrespective of whether an attack
occurs or not. However, in the event of an attack, which may
be accumulatively extremely expensive if allowed to persist
indeﬁnitely because of lack of detection, the insurance can
provide a much needed hedge against the damage. In actual
deployments, whether to procure such insurance (i.e., turn on
the MTD or not) is likely a matter of diverse factors such
as institutional policies (including the institution’s attitude
towards risk taking), estimated vulnerability to attacks or
likelihood of attacks, and the cost-beneﬁt tradeoff speciﬁc to
the power grid in question. This paper sheds light on tradeoffs
in the key technical problem, which serves as an important
reference basis for the other questions. Nevertheless, it does
not attempt to answer all the questions, particularly policy
questions, that are also interesting.
The main contributions of the paper are summarized as
follows:
• We derive conditions for an MTD reactance perturbation
to ensure that no FDI attacks crafted based on the out-
dated (pre-perturbation) system conﬁguration will remain
stealthy after the perturbation.
• When the reactance adjustment capability of D-FACTS is
insufﬁcient for achieving the above condition, we present
heuristic design criteria for selecting MTD perturbations
that can still highly likely achieve effective attack detec-
tion.
• We characterize the tradeoff between the MTD’s effec-
tiveness and its operational cost in a constrained opti-
mization framework. Additionally, we present extensive
simulation results using the realistic MATPOWER sim-
ulator for benchmark IEEE bus systems to verify and
illustrate the tradeoff.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II reviews related work. Section III introduces the pre-
liminaries. Section IV explains the attacker and the defender
model. Sections V and VI analyze the MTD’s effectiveness
and its cost-beneﬁt tradeoff. Section VII presents simulation
results. Section VIII concludes. The technical proofs can be
found in Appendices A,B and C.
II. PRIOR WORK
Recent work [4] analyzed the condition for bypassing the
BDD of SE and proposed a technique to construct BDD-
bypassing FDI attacks using complete knowledge of the power
grid topology and the branch reactances. Subsequent research
[16] showed that such attacks can be constructed using partial
knowledge of the power grid topology. However, the knowl-
edge of power grid topology is difﬁcult to obtain in practice.
Recent work [17], [18] showed that BDD-bypassing attacks
can also be crafted using the eavesdropped measurement data
only. The impact of such stealthy FDI attacks on system
efﬁciency and safety were investigated. In particular,
the
economic impact of FDI attacks were studied in [19] and [20].
Reference [6] showed that the attacker can drive the power
system frequency to unsafe levels by injecting a sequence of
carefully-crafted FDI attacks.
To address BDD’s vulnerability, defense mechanisms based
on protecting a strategically-selected set of sensors and their
data links were proposed [7], [8], [9]. The use of generalized
likelihood ratio test was proposed to detect FDI attacks when
the adversary has access to only a few meters in [21].
Reference [22] presented a sparse optimization based approach
to separate nominal power grid states and anomalies.
The concept of MTD was originally proposed for enterprise
networks based on changing the IT features of devices such
as end hosts’ IP addresses and port numbers, the routing
paths between nodes, etc. [23], [24]. More recent work has
proposed MTD in power systems by changing its physical
characteristics [11], [12], [13]. In particular, on-going FDI
attacks can be detected by introducing reactance perturbations
that are known only to the defender (SO) [11], since the
change in sensor measurements (after the perturbations) will
be different from its predicted value based on the power
ﬂow model (due to the attack). It has also been shown that
stealthy FDI attacks can be precluded by actively perturbing
the branch reactances to invalidate the attacker’s knowledge
[13]. We similarly consider MTD for power systems in this
paper. Compared with the prior work, ours is the ﬁrst to jointly
consider the MTD’s effectiveness and its operational cost. We
provide hitherto unavailable formal design criteria for selecting
effective MTD reactance perturbations, and expose important
tradeoffs between the effectiveness and operational cost.
III. PRELIMINARIES
Power Grid Model
We consider a power network that is characterized by a set
N = {1, . . . , N} of buses, L = {1, . . . , L} of transmission
lines (an example of the 4 bus power system is shown in
Figure 3). The line l ∈ L that connects bus i and bus j is
denoted by l = {i, j}. The time of operation is denoted by
t ∈ R.
