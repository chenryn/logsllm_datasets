I used following definition to create a pod:
    {
      "id": "containermanifest",
      "kind": "Pod",
      "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
      "desiredState": {
        "manifest": {
          "version": "v1beta1",
          "id": "containermanifest",
          "containers": [{
            "name": "heapster",
            "image": "kubernetes/heapster",
          }],
          "restarPolicy": {"never": {}}
        }
      },
      "labels": {
        "name": "containermanifest"
      }
    }
The creation succeeded. But I found the restartPolicy remained to be `always`.
I was confused and look again and again into the code and template. Finally I
found I made a typo `restarPolicy`. It seems the engine ignored this line and
used the default value of `restartPolicy`.
It's a small mistake but took me a lot of time. So I think we should validate
each field of the template and warn the user about those unrecognized fields.
