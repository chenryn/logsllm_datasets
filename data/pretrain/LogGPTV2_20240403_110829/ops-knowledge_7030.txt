User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题InnoDB no longer available Recently changed servers and went from CentOS 5.8 to CentOS 6.4.  I installed MySQL 5.1.69 on my new server, and manually swapped /var/lib/mysql.  I am not sure what version of MySQL was on my old server, but would expect it to be the same.

When I try to query a table, I get the following:

ERROR 1286 (42000): Unknown table engine 'InnoDB'


Tables which don't use InnoDB work fine.  Looks like I don't have InnoDB loaded. I installed MySQL using yum install mysql mysql-server.  Why is InnoDB not loaded, and how should I load it?

EDIT:

Maybe I should manually change ib_logfile0 to have the file size the same?

Assistant: Seems like this is a good answer.  Which basically states that you should remove/rebuild the ib_logfile0 yourself.  Just move the file to someplace safe—not in the MySQL directory that is looking for it—and restart the server.

The caveat is: Do you actually have DBs that require InnoDB?  If so, you can manually do a mydump of each DB to get a backup, then drop the DBs from the MySQL database, shut down MySQL, move/delete the ib_logfile0—I also suggest moving/deleting the ibdata1 and ib_logfile1 as well—and just restarting MySQL.

Then check your logs to see if InnoDB has started.  I bet it will.  At that point recreate the DBs you go rid of &amp; reimport the data.  New ibdata1, ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1 files will be created and all should be good.
