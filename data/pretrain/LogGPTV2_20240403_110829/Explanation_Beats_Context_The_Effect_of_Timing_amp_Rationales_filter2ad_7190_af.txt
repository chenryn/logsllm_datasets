A Study Procedure
This section lists the questions of the survey in the same
order they were shown to participants. Note that Sections A.1
and A.2 are repeated four times per participant.
A.1 Pre-Questionnaire
The {ﬁrst/second/third/last} app of interest is called {app
name}. Imagine the following scenario: You have recently
installed the {app name} app on your phone. {sentence de-
scribing the major functionalities of the app}. You want to
use this app to {objective to use the app}.
[Show a screenshot of the homescreen with the app icon.]
App Familiarity (Familiarity): Have you used this app be-
fore? (i) Yes (ii) No (iii) Do not know.
Permission Predictability (PermPredict): Would you expect
this app to request access to your {permission protected re-
source}? (i) Yes (ii) No.
Permission Sensitivity (PermSens): When using mobile apps,
many people ﬁnd that there are some resource accesses (per-
missions) that they are generally comfortable granting, some
accesses that they are only comfortable granting under cer-
tain conditions, and some accesses are too sensitive that they
never or only rarely are comfortable granting. Given the infor-
mation that this app will request access to your {permission
protected resource}. Please indicate to what extent you agree
or disagree with the following statements. (i) In general, I
do not feel comfortable granting access to my {permission
protected resource} (ii) I feel that this app requires access to
a very private resource (iii) The access to my {permission
protected resource} is very sensitive to me.
Permission Clarity before app interaction (ClarityPre): (i) I
understand the reason for this app to request access to my {per-
mission protected resource} (ii) I have no idea why this app
wants access to my {permission protected resource} (iii) It
is clear to me why this app needs access to my {permission
protected resource}.
Figure 8: Sample interactive mockup app interaction
A.2 Post-Questionnaire
Now, imagine that you downloaded {app name} on your
phone to {objective to use the app}. Below this text is an
interactive mockup app of {app name}. Please interact with
the app as you would on your own phone until access to your
{permission protected resource} is requested. You can repeat
your interaction with the app by clicking the reset button.
Then answer the following questions.
[Show interactive mockup app same as in Figure 8.]
Permission Decision (Decision): Based on your interaction
with this app, would you grant this app access to your {per-
mission protected resource}? (i) Yes (ii) No.
Permission Purpose (PermPurp): In your opinion, for what
does this app need access to your {permission protected re-
source}? (i) For the main functionality of the app (app cannot
function without it) (ii) For some additional feature function-
ality (iii) Do not know (iv) For some other reason.
Permission Clarity after app interaction (ClarityPost): After
interacting with the above mockup app, please indicate to
what extent you agree or disagree with the following state-
ments. (i) I understand the reason for this app to request
access to my {permission protected resource} (ii) I have no
idea why this app wants access to my {permission protected
resource} (iii) It is clear to me why this app needs access to
my {permission protected resource}.

Only for requests with rationales: Rationale Origin
(RationaleOrigin): Who do you think provided the explana-
tory message “This app requires access to your {permission
protected resource} to...” that was displayed in a separate dia-
log immediately before requesting access to your {permission
protected resource}? (i) The mobile operating system (ii) The
app developer (iii) Do not know (iv) Some other entity.
Decision Evaluation Scales (DES): In a previous question
you chose to {allow/deny} this app access to your {permis-
sion protected resource}. We would like to know how you
feel about this decision. Please state to what extent you agree
or disagree with the following statements.
Decision Satisfaction (DesSatis): (i) I expect to stick with my
decision (ii) I am satisﬁed with my decision (iii) I am doubtful
about my choice (iv) I would make the same decision if I had
to interact with this app again.
Informed Decision (DesInform): (i) I am satisﬁed with the in-
formation I received (ii) I know the pros and cons of granting
this app access to my {permission protected resource} (iii) I
would have liked more information about how the app will
use the access to my {permission protected resource} (iv) I
made a well-informed choice.
Decision Control (DesControl): (i) I felt pressured by the app
to make this decision (ii) The app allowed me to make my
own decision (iii) I feel that the app forced me to make this
decision (iv) This was my own decision.
Only for
requests with rationales: Rationale Recall
(RationaleRecall): While interacting with the {app name} app
you saw a dialog explaining why the app needs access to your
{permission protected resource}. It started with: “This app
requires access to your {permission protected resource} to ...”
Please complete this message as far as you remember. Note:
The dialog we are asking you about is the one that immedi-
ately preceded the dialog in which you were asked to grant
or deny access to your {permission protected resource}. Free
response.

C Model ﬁt
We statistically compared all steps in the model building pro-
cess using the akaike information criterion (AIC) and the
likelihood-ratio tests. The model that described our data best
and had the lowest AIC score was selected as the ﬁnal model.
To remain consistent with the theoretical design of our study,
we included the variables of interest (step 3) for the DesControl
model even if this step was not signiﬁcant. Table 2 present
the goodness of ﬁt, marginal R2 and conditional R2 for each
step in the model building process of all outcome variables.
