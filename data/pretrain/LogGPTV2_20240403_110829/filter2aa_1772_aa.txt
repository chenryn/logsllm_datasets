Norse%W Sony
• While Norse is not involved in the Sony case, it has 
done its own investigation, and stated “We are very 
confident that this was not an attack master-minded by 
North Korea and that insiders were key to the 
implementation of one of the most devastating attacks 
in history”. Stammberger says Norse data is pointing 
towards a woman who calls herself “Lena” and claims to 
be connected with the so-called “Guardians of Peace” 
hacking group. Norse believes it’s identified this woman 
as someone who worked at Sony in Los Angeles for ten 
years until leaving the company this past May.

Who%Is%Right?%%Who%Is%Wrong?
If evidence ends up being released, and there is clear 
attribution, how will this impact companies like Norse 
and Crowdstrike that have made such bold 
statements? If a company making this statement is 
blatantly wrong, does that suggest threat intelligence 
they sell can’t be trusted or relied on by corporations?

Attribution%Is%Hard
• Cyberspace does have some unique attributes which are not 
mirrored in the real world.
– Typical CSI forensic / investigation work not possible
• Easy to “spoof” evidence
• Easy to use or embed others work (tools, exploits, malware)
– Just because it was used doesn’t mean that it was same people
– It could easily be used by different people/groups
• Nonexistence of physical “territory”
– Some attribution markers used in other areas such as warfare are 
missing.
– Hackers typically don’t need an ‘assembly zone’ that can be 
detected and watched. 
– No ground boundary needs to be crossed
– No way to track back a “missile” launch without question

So how can we actually figure out 
who is behind these “hacks”?
• No security firm typically agrees on who’s done it
• Can’t trust when people “claiming” attacks
• Easy to hide IP addresses via Proxy servers, TOR, etc.
• Correlations between certain pieces of malware isn’t 
hard evidence (debatable)
• Information (evidence) not shared to protect sources
• Using a “behavioral analysis unit” of FBI experts trained
