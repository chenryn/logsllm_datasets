Condition query: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition; 6. Join query: SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2. id; 7. Fuzzy matching: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE column1 LIKE '%keyword%'; 8. Aggregation function: SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name; 9. Subquery: SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_1 IN (SELECT column_1 FROM table_2 WHERE condition); 10. Update data: UPDATE table_name SET column1=value1 WHERE condition; 11.
