### Title: Reversing a Japanese Wireless SD Card - From Zero to Code Execution

**Abstract:**

Toshiba FlashAir wireless SD cards are popular among photographers and IoT enthusiasts. These cards integrate both a Japanese System-on-Chip (SoC) and a proprietary Japanese Operating System (OS). Prior to this project, these components had not been extensively discussed in security conferences or clearly identified.

The SoC, which is also used in embedded devices and the automotive industry, employs an instruction set architecture (ISA) that resembles MIPS but includes unique instructions, such as loop constructs. The OS adheres to a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) specification, which, according to a survey by its designers, is believed to be used in approximately 60% of currently deployed embedded systems.

This presentation will detail the investigative process that led to the discovery of the card's architecture and operating system, starting from nearly zero knowledge. The investigation was conducted using only open-source tools: miasm2 for assembly, disassembly, and emulation, and radare2 as the interface for firmware analysis. Additionally, specific tools developed during this project will be released following the talk.

The methodology and step-by-step approach that enabled code execution on the card will be thoroughly explained. This includes techniques ranging from reading assembly code to accessing online documentation in both English and Japanese. The primary objective is to share the lessons learned and the mistakes made during the project, providing valuable insights for the community.

Finally, a complete demonstration of code execution on the FlashAir card will be presented.
