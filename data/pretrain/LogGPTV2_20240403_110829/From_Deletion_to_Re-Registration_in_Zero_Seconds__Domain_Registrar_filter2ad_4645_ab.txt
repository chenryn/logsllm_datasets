from Verisign’s RDAP test deployment [3], and fell back to Whois
lookups in the rare case of errors. For example, domains sponsored
by Papaki Ltd (registrar IANA ID 1727) resulted in HTTP 500 errors
from the RDAP server, but had the expected data available using
Whois. At least 8 weeks after the deletion date, we repeated the
same lookups to collect metadata about any possible re-registration.
Of a total of 4,599,802 .com domains from the pending delete lists,
512,802 (11.2 %) were re-registered on the deletion day and form
the basis of our dataset. Because the volume of .net domains on
the pending delete list was nearly an order of magnitude smaller,
we restricted our lookups to .com domains. In light of our findings
in Section 4.1, this decision turned out to be unfortunate.

4 ANALYSIS
On the deletion day, most domain re-registrations occur during
the time of the Drop. Figure 2 shows that no .com domain is re-
registered before 7 pm UTC. One hour later, around 9.4 % of all
deleted domains have already been re-registered; this percentage
increases to 11.2 % by the end of the day. The one-hour period from
7 to 8 pm accounts for 84 % of all same-day domain re-registrations.
During the Drop, same-day re-registration rates are high at over
100 domains per minute. Towards the end, the (aggregate) rate
slowly decreases until it reaches just 3 re-registrations per minute
at 9 pm on an average day. On any individual day, re-registration
rates drop sharply immediately after the end of the Drop. The slower
decrease in Figure 2 is due to aggregation of data over 56 days.
The duration of the Drop depends on the number of domains
deleted. As shown in Figure 1, the length of Verisign’s pending
delete list for .com ranges from 66 k to almost 112 k domains during
our measurement period. The Drop may end before 8 pm on some
days, and can last much longer on other days with more deletions.
From the last observed drop-catch re-registration detected using
the methodology from Section 4.2, we estimate that the longest
Drop occurred on 18 January, the day with most domain deletions,
and lasted until at least 20:49:48 UTC. Since the domains deleted
last are not necessarily re-registered, the Drop is likely longer than
our estimate. For example, 11 February had the shortest estimated
duration (until 19:56:32 UTC), whereas the following day had fewer
domain deletions, but an estimated duration until 19:58:29 UTC.
4.1 Domain Deletion Order
Online sources suggest that the order in which expired domains
become available for re-registration during the Drop is predict-
able [1, 16]. However, we are not aware of any public source con-
taining details about such a deletion order, presumably because this
knowledge confers a competitive advantage to participants in the
drop-catch race. If we plot domains in deletion order against their
re-registration timestamp, we expect re-registrations to occur on
or above a diagonal line, where the line corresponds to the earliest
possible time, and the area above to delayed re-registrations. The
area below the line should remain blank, as no domain is expec-
ted to be re-registered before the predicted earliest possible time.
The upper part of Figure 3 shows such a plot using the order of
Verisign’s pending delete list. Since the re-registration points cover
the entire area corresponding to the Drop period from 7 to 8 pm, it
is evident that they are not in deletion order.

After similarly ruling out domain deletions ordered by domain ID,
registrar ID, creation date, expiration date or alphabetical order, we
find that deletions likely occur ordered by the domain registration’s
“last updated” time. Since timestamps in our dataset are at a second
precision and many registrars update large batches of domains
at the same time, this ordering can be ambiguous. A secondary
sorting criterion of creation timestamp or domain ID appears to
work well; we opt for domain IDs because they induce a total order.
The lower half of Figure 3 uses this order to visualise deletion day
re-registrations on 2 January 2018. Around 80 % of same-day re-
registration points appear on the highlighted diagonal, and none
below. We conclude that a deletion order exists, and that it is closely
approximated by the update time and domain ID ordering.
For each deletion day, we re-order Verisign’s pending delete
list and assign each domain a rank based on the inferred deletion
order. The heatmap in Figure 4a aggregates the result over all 56
days. Diagonal lines of different lengths correspond to days with
different quantities of domains being deleted. The diagonal lines do
not perfectly overlap, appearing to have different slopes, and they
are not entirely straight as one may expect. We hypothesise that
Verisign may have a single domain deletion process for both .com
and .net domains combined, as suggested by DNmeter [1]. We
did not collect data for .net domains, and our computed domain
ranks do not account for .net domains that may be interleaved
with the .com domains. Even though their volume is comparatively
low, they may appear in batches in the deletion order and make the
curve deviate from an ideal straight line.
Most of the domains appear to be re-registered as early as pos-
sible, as the highest density is on the diagonal lines. Delayed domain
re-registrations (above the diagonal) occur at a rate at least one
order of magnitude lower than during the deletion instant.
To observe the behaviour of services across all of the regis-
trars they control, we reuse the methodology from prior work [10]
and cluster registrars according to their contact details. For re-
registrations on the deletion day, DropCatch (not shown) and Snap-
Names (Figure 4b) are by far the most popular registrar clusters.
Both are well-known drop-catch services, and appear to focus all
their efforts during the Drop on early re-registrations, as indicated
by the dark diagonal lines and the empty area above. The horizontal
lines around 8.30 pm and later indicate domains re-registered in
batches independent of the original deletion order; the timing sug-
gests that such delayed re-registrations are held back until the end

Figure 4: Heatmaps of re-registration times by the domain’s deletion order rank, aggregated over 56 deletion days; intensity indicates number of re-registrations
per bin (log scale, different for each subplot). Domains re-registered as early as possible appear on diagonal lines, delayed re-registrations above the lines, and
re-registration batches independent of original deletion times as horizontal lines. Most re-registrations are as early as possible. Drop-catch services such as
SnapNames (b) or Pheenix (c) dominate re-registrations and exhibit behaviour distinct from regular registrars (e.g., d) or API providers (f).
of the Drop. Figure 4c shows similar trends for Pheenix, a drop-
catch service that appears to be less active.
GoDaddy, depicted in Figure 4d, does not have such a strong
focus on the diagonal; instead, re-registrations appear all over
the area above, suggesting that domains are re-registered seconds,
minutes and hours after the deletion time. This may be explained
by GoDaddy’s role as the globally most popular domain registrar.
Xinnet (Figure 4e) combines features of drop-catch and regular
registrars, with a distinguishable, though more spread out diagonal
line, suggesting re-registrations close to the earliest possible in-
stant, but not as timely as those made by SnapNames, for instance.
Re-registrations delayed by 30 minutes or more occur even during
the Drop, although not as frequent as for GoDaddy; more delayed
re-registrations start shortly after 8 pm and last well beyond 9 pm.
Some registrars such as 1API offer APIs that customers could use
for their own drop-catch scripts. Figure 4f confirms that customers
indeed use the API for same-day re-registrations, but (in this case)
not with the same scale or timeliness as drop-catch services. Precise
prediction of when domains will be deleted appears to be a well
guarded “secret” of the drop-catch trade.
4.2 Earliest Re-Registration Times
To analyse the timeliness of domain re-registrations, we need to
infer the first moment when a domain can be re-registered. We
assume that competition causes drop-catch services to attempt re-
registrations immediately upon deletion, which means that our data-
set contains many observations of earliest possible re-registrations.
Furthermore, we assume that domains are deleted in a predictable
order, which implies that the subset of domains re-registered as
4
early as possible must have monotonically increasing timestamps,
as visible in the dark diagonal in the lower half of Figure 3. To
predict the earliest possible re-registration time of a domain given
its rank in the deletion order, we need to model this diagonal.
The diagonal suggests a linear relationship between the deletion
rank and the earliest re-registration time, which could be modelled
using linear regression. Yet, the deviations from a straight line seen
in Figure 4a can cause errors in the order of minutes. Furthermore, a
priori prediction is not necessary for our purposes; it is sufficient if
we can use the observed data a posteriori. Instead of attempting to fit
a straight line, we identify the domains that have been re-registered
as early as possible by computing the “minimum envelope” curve
of the scatterplot. Specifically, we look for a sequence of domain
re-registrations in deletion order such that their re-registration
timestamps are monotonically increasing, and minimal. Iterating
over ranks from right to left, we retain any re-registration if its
delay from 7 pm is no larger than the value previously added to
the curve. This approach could lead to outliers at the right end of
the curve. For example, if the domain with the numerically highest
rank is re-registered with a large delay, it should not become part
of the curve because it does not indicate an as-early-as-possible re-
registration instant. To address this issue, we additionally truncate
the right end of the curve wherever the time delay between two
consecutive points on the curve is larger than one minute, which
has proven to be a good indicator for the end of the Drop.
We calculate this minimum envelope curve separately for each
deletion day to obtain better accuracy, given our observation of
different Drop durations, different slopes and imperfect linearity in
Figure 4a. As an illustration, the lower half of Figure 3 highlights

the minimum envelope for 2 January 2018. Each day has a median
of 7.6 k points on the envelope curve; the delay between two con-
secutive points is 3 s or less for 99 % of points on the curves, with a
maximum of 38 s. Figure 7 shows that nearly all re-registrations on
the curve come from drop-catch services, which makes us confident
that our strategy closely models the actual domain deletion curve.
To infer the earliest possible re-registration time for any domain
given its rank in the deletion order, we return the actually observed
re-registration time if the rank corresponds to a point on the de-
letion day’s minimum envelope curve, which occurs for 52 % of
the re-registered domains in our dataset. For 48 % of domains, we
apply linear interpolation between the two neighbouring points
with the closest smaller and higher ranks on the curve. Typically,
these points are no more than 3 s apart, and we round the interpol-
ated time to the closest second in order to remain consistent with
the precision of the original timestamps in the RDAP data. Only
0.02 % of re-registered domains in our data have ranks outside the
range of their minimum envelope curve, which causes us to use the
first or last re-registration time from the curve. The re-registration
delay is the time difference between the inferred earliest possible
re-registration, and the actually observed re-registration timestamp.
4.3 Re-Registration Delays
About 9.5 % of deleted .com domains are re-registered with a delay
of 0 s, that is, in the instant we predict as their deletion time. This
percentage grows to 13 % for domains re-registered with a 24 h
