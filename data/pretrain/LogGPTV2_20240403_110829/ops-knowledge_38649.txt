User: How to carry out network security prevention? Please list several network attack methods and explain the corresponding preventive measures.
Assistant: Network Security Precautions: 1. Strong Passwords: Using strong passwords and making sure that different accounts use different passwords is the number one measure of network security. 2. 2-Step Verification: Enable 2-Step Verification for added security, which means you can be identified by means other than a password, such as using your fingerprint or mobile device. 3. Anti-virus software: Use the latest anti-virus software and update the virus library in time to protect the device security. 4. Improve Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities: Keep the operating system, applications, and all plug-ins or extensions updated to the latest versions to strengthen network security. 5. Deactivate unnecessary services: To maintain a computer's suite and services, they must be turned on when deactivating unnecessary services or when services are required to ensure network and data security. 6. Restricting Privileges: Users must restrict access to their user accounts to the bare minimum they need. This helps prevent unauthorized access and malicious activity. Network attack methods: 1. DDoS attack: The attacker uses multiple computers or devices to send a large amount of traffic, causing the victim's network performance to degrade or even stop working completely. Countermeasures: Install and use anti-DDoS equipment/software, and limit the number of connections under the same IP address. 2. Malware: Attackers use malware to infect a victim's computer or device for data theft, extortion, or other illegal activities. Precautions: Install an antivirus program, only install software downloaded from trusted sources, and avoid downloading files from unknown websites. 3. Spyware: These are software designed to track or monitor a user's activities. Attackers can steal sensitive information such as passwords and credit card information. Preventative measures: Install anti-spyware software and use HTTPS/SSL protocols whenever possible to ensure that connections to the Internet are encrypted to avoid interception of sensitive data. 4. Phishing attacks: Attackers use deceptive information, such as forged emails, to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Precautions: Avoid clicking or replying to suspicious emails, and never share sensitive information. Avoid following untrustworthy links while browsing the web.
