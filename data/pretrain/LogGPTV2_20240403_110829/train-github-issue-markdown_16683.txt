I am trying to use a decorator with an anonymous class (class expression) on
TypeScript 1.8.9 and am receiving the error: "error TS1206: Decorators are not
valid here."
    const decorator: MethodDecorator = function (target: Object, propertyKey: string,
        descriptor: TypedPropertyDescriptor): TypedPropertyDescriptor {
        return descriptor;
    };
    const C = class { 
        @decorator method() {} 
    };
I didn't see anything addressing decorating anonymous classes in the roadmap,
so I am filing this issue to either provide clarification to other people in
my situation or to mark a bug.
