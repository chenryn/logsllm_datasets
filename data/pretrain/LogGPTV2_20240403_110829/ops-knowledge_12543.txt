Can someone help me?

Assistant: I think you are requesting some script from the same server, and 504
is likely due to only one PHP backend process, So when you request from browser its only one request and is getting server.
If you are using php-cgi, configuring environment variable before starting php-cgi, hope it helps.

set PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN=0
set PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS=10000`

Check that your backend can handle multiple requests simultaneously and that your script doesn't somehow create a dead-look (requesting the output of itself).
Check FCGI logs. If that doesn't help, increment the debug levels on nginx.
