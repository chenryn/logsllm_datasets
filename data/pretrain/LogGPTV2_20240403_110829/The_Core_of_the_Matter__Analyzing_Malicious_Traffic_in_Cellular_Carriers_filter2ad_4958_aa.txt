## Abstract

While much of the research on mobile malware has focused on the detailed analysis of malicious applications, these studies have not quantified the prevalence of actual infections. This paper presents the first such attempt by analyzing the hosting infrastructure used by mobile applications. Using DNS traffic collected over three months from a major US cellular provider and a major US non-cellular Internet service provider, we identify the DNS domains queried by mobile applications and analyze the associated Internet hosts. Our key findings include:
1. Mobile malware appears in a minuscule number of devices: 3,492 out of over 380 million (less than 0.0009%).
2. iOS users are as likely to communicate with known low-reputation domains as users of other platforms.
3. We observe two malware campaigns and their lifetimes and network properties, noting that one campaign ceased before the associated malware was discovered.

## 1. Introduction

The focus on mobile malware has primarily been on the in-depth analysis of malicious applications, providing valuable insights into the methods and data targeted by malware writers. However, these studies have not quantified the extent to which mobile devices are actually infected. In this paper, we present the first attempt to do so by studying the hosting infrastructure used by mobile applications. Using DNS traffic collected over three months from a major US cellular provider and a major US non-cellular ISP, we identify the DNS domains queried by mobile applications and analyze the related Internet hosts.

Our findings are significant:
- Only a very small fraction of mobile devices (3,492 out of over 380 million) appear to be infected, suggesting that current security measures in application markets are generally effective.
- iOS users are as likely to communicate with known low-reputation domains as users of other platforms, challenging the notion that iOS is inherently more secure.
- We observed two malware campaigns, noting that one ceased operations long before the associated malware was discovered, indicating the potential for network-based countermeasures.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is a critical protocol that maps domain names to IP addresses. The domain name space is hierarchical, starting with a root node, followed by top-level domains (TLDs), second-level domains, and so on. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) includes all domain levels, such as `www.example.com`. DNS uses resource records (RRs) to link domain names with IP addresses (A-type RR) or other domain names (CNAME-type RR).

### 2.2 Passive DNS Monitoring

Passive DNS (pDNS) monitoring involves collecting DNS queries at recursive DNS resolvers (RDNS). This method allows logging and analyzing malicious queries without alerting the owners of malicious domains. pDNS can also discover new malicious domains not yet listed on DNS blacklists. However, it requires a large, geographically diverse set of RDNS servers to collect comprehensive data.

## 3. Methodology

We analyze DNS data from a major US cellular carrier, focusing on Internet-based hosts contacted by mobile devices. Our monitoring point aggregates traffic from several RDNS servers across different US states. We perform two main tasks:
1. **Mobile Device Identification:** Filter out traffic from non-mobile devices and attribute requests to specific mobile devices.
2. **Reputation Analysis:** Classify DNS responses as benign, malicious, or unknown based on historical evidence of Internet abuse.

### 3.1 Mobile Device Identification Process

Identifying individual mobile devices is challenging due to IP address churn and device roaming. We use proprietary data from the carrier to attribute traffic to mobile devices within each epoch. We filter out non-mobile traffic by examining resource records for mobile-specific indicators, such as subdomains like `m.example.com` or `mobile.example.com`.

### 3.2 Reputation Analysis

We classify DNS responses using a reputation system. Each DNS query and response is represented as a tuple, and we use historical data to determine the reputation of the resolved hosts. This helps in identifying and classifying malicious traffic.

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

### 4.1 Dataset Collection

We collected DNS data from a major US cellular provider and a major US non-cellular ISP over three months. This dataset includes DNS queries and responses, allowing us to analyze the domains and hosts contacted by mobile devices.

### 4.2 Knowledge Base and Passive DNS Data

We use a knowledge base of known malicious and benign domains and passive DNS data from a large non-cellular US ISP to validate our findings. This combined approach helps in identifying and characterizing malicious behavior in cellular networks.

## 5. Findings

### 5.1 Prevalence of Mobile Malware

Our analysis shows that only a very small fraction of mobile devices (3,492 out of over 380 million) are infected with malware. This suggests that while not perfect, current security measures in application markets are generally effective.

### 5.2 Comparison of iOS and Other Platforms

Contrary to common belief, iOS users are as likely to communicate with known low-reputation domains as users of other platforms. This challenges the notion that iOS provides significantly better security.

### 5.3 Malware Campaigns

We observed two malware campaigns and analyzed their lifetimes and network properties. One campaign ceased operations long before the associated malware was discovered, indicating the potential for network-based countermeasures to identify and mitigate future threats.

## Conclusion

This study provides the first network-level analysis of mobile malware using DNS traffic from a major cellular provider. Our findings suggest that while mobile malware is a concern, the current prevalence is low, and network-based countermeasures may be effective in mitigating future threats. Further research is needed to develop and implement these countermeasures.
