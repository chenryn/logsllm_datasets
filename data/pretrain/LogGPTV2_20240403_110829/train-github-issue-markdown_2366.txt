Platform: OS X 10.10  
Atom Version: 0.201.0
Description:  
Changing tabs using the mouse button (clicking on them) steals the focus from
the editor window and requires another click into the text to continue
writing.
Expected behavior:  
Text editor regains focus after tabs are switched.
Note:  
Changing tabs using keyboard shortcuts works and won't steal the focus
