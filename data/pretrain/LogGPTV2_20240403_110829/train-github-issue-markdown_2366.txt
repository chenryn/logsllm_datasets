**Platform:** macOS 10.10  
**Atom Version:** 0.201.0

**Description:**
When switching tabs by clicking on them with the mouse, the focus is taken away from the editor window. As a result, an additional click is required to return the focus to the text, allowing the user to continue writing.

**Expected Behavior:**
After switching tabs, the text editor should automatically regain focus, enabling the user to continue typing without needing to click back into the text.

**Note:**
Switching tabs using keyboard shortcuts does not cause this issue and maintains the focus within the editor.
