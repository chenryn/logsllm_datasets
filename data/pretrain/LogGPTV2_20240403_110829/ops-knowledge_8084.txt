User: I am writing a Windows python program that needs to query WMI. I am planning to do this by using the subprocess module to call WMIC with the arguments I need.
I see a lot of examples online of using WMI via PowerShell, usually using the "commandlet" Get-WmiObject or the equivalent gwmi.
How do you do the equivalent of Get-WmiObject without using PowerShell, but rather with WMIC?
Specificially, from within CMD.EXE, I want to do powershell gwmi Win32_USBControllerDevice, but without using powershell; rather, I want to invoke WMIC directly.
Thanks, and sorry for the beginner question!
Assistant: From CMD.EXE, I think the command I need is wmic path Win32_USBControllerDevice get *
So most likely the general pattern is:

PowerShell: gwmi MYCLASSNAME 
translates into:
CMD.EXE: wmic path
MYCLASSNAME get *
