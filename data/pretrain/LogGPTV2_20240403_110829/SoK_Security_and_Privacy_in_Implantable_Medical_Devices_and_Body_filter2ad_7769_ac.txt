A typical distance-bounding protocol between a pro-
grammer and IMD, for example, involves the programmer
proving to the IMD that it is physically close (e.g., within
3 cm). Rasmussen et al. [65] use ultrasonic sound signals
to compute the distance bound of a programmer and IMD,
since it is impossible for an attacker to send audio data that
propagates faster than the speed of sound. Shi et al. [48], [54]
use received signal strength (RSS) variation to differentiate
BAN devices on the same body from external signals (i.e.,
attacker transmissions). This technique relies on the obser-
vation that the RSS variation between two BAN devices on
the same body is more stable than the RSS between an on-
body device and an external device. Jurik et al. [57] make
use of ECG signals to establish the continued proximity of
an authenticated mobile device to a user.
Distance bounds are also computed over body-coupled
communication (BCC). BCC uses the human body as a
transmission medium, requiring physical proximity to the
patient in order to communicate. Li et al. [18] introduce
wireless attacks against BCC and ﬁnd that both passive and
active attacks are mitigated for distances greater than 0.5 m.
Chang et al. [52] inject artiﬁcial signals through the patient’s
body to authenticate BAN devices on the same body. These
signals, however, only achieve an estimated 0.469 to 5.429
bits per hour, making this technique impractical.
In the related ﬁeld of RFID, system implementations
have inaccurately assumed distance-bounding guarantees as
a result of short read ranges (e.g., 10 cm). Kﬁr et al. [81]
introduce a relay attack in which two coordinated adversaries
fool an RFID reader into believing that the RFID tag is
nearby. Relay attacks can be mitigated with context-aware
communication [82], a method which requires the user to
perform an uncommon, but easily repeatable movement in
order to be authenticated. The applicability of this defense
to IMDs is debatable, however, because a patient may not
be able to authenticate in the event of a medical emergency.
Cremers et al. [83] provide a classiﬁcation of distance-
bounding attacks that assumes weak authentication, suggest-
ing additional evaluation is required before such protocols
are used in the medical setting; the adversarial capabilities
necessary to launch these attacks are included in our model.
Cremers et al. use the terminology veriﬁer and prover to
describe the participants in distance-bounding protocols; the
veriﬁer establishes physical proximity to the prover. The
attacks consider various adversarial capabilities for falsifying
physical proximity to the prover. Speciﬁcally, the adversary
may modify transmissions between a veriﬁer and prover. He
may introduce his own dishonest prover, or he may collude
with other dishonest entities. Lastly, he may also exploit
honest provers (e.g., by ﬁrst allowing the prover to establish
physical proximity, then jamming subsequent prover trans-
missions and authenticating in the prover’s stead).
3) Out-of-Band (OOB) Authentication: OOB techniques
make use of auxiliary channels, such as audio, visual, and
tactile, that are outside the established data communication
channel [12], [39], [73], [84]. Using auxiliary channels for
authentication obviates the need for trusted third parties
and key pre-distribution schemes. A common assumption
in these schemes is that the chosen out-of-band channel is
resistant to eavesdropping attacks.
Halperin et al. [12] propose an OOB authentication
scheme that uses a low-frequency audio channel. The basic
idea is that the IMD uses a zero-power RFID device to
generate a random key and transmit
it over the audio
channel. The patient is alerted when a key exchange occurs
through vibrations produced by a piezo element connected

to the RFID device. The programmer, at a distance of no
more than 0.6 m to 0.9 m [61], listens for the key and then
establishes a secure authenticated channel with the IMD.
Halevi et al. [61] examine a passive adversary with the
ability to deploy (or otherwise make use of) a general-
purpose microphone (e.g., PC microphone) in the vicinity
of the IMD/programmer communication. Halevi et al. show
that although the measured piezo sound accuracy varies
with distance, the average key retrieval correctness at 0.9 m,
computed for multiple supervised methods, is as high as
99.88 %. This contradicts Halperin et al.’s [12] earlier exper-
imental result, which indicates the audio channel is resistant
to eavesdropping.
Alternatively, Denning et al. [39] and Li et al. [73] opt for
visual OOB authentication. Denning et al. propose the use
of ultra-violet or visible tattoos to record permanent IMD
keys. This mechanism allows emergency authentication, but
does not allow for key revocation and may suffer from
usability concerns [39]. Li et al. [73] require the users to
visually inspect simultaneous LED blinking patterns in order
to achieve authentication in BANs. The usability of this
scheme is unclear and it is unlikely to be appropriate for
emergency scenarios, so its applicability to IMDs is limited.
4) External Wearable Devices: A unique approach to
securing IMD/BAN telemetry makes use of external devices
worn by the patient. The basic idea is that this external de-
