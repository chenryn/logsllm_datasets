User: When it comes to organizing python modules, my Mac OS X system is a mess. I've packages lying around everywhere on my hdd and no particular system to organize them.
How do you keep everything manageable?
Assistant: In addition to PEP8 and easy_install, you should check out virtualenv. Virtualenv allows you to have multiple different python library trees. At work, we use virtualenv with a bootstrapping environment to quickly set up a development/production environment where we are all in sync w.r.t library versions etc. We generally coordinate library upgrades.
