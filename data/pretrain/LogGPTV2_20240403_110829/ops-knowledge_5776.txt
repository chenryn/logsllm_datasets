User: I can't run my PyCharm IDE using port 80.
I need to use PayPal that requires me to use port 80.
But using Mac OS X 10.8 I can't have it working because of permission issues.
I've already tried running PyCharm with SUDO command.
Does anyone know how to run Pycharm using port 80, or any other solution?
Thanks.
