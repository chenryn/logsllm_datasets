Steps to reproduce error:
  1. Setup symfony 2.8
  2. Use the configuration setting security: firewals: main: form_login: intention:
  3. Observe that **none** of the error messages intended to help correct the deprecated setting show up, only the generic error is reported, negating the utility of the 20 lines committed to fix this setting.
    if (isset($options['intention'])) {
                if (isset($options['csrf_token_id'])) {
                    throw new \InvalidArgumentException(sprintf('You should only define an option for one of "intention" or "csrf_token_id" for the "%s". Use the "csrf_token_id" as it replaces "intention".', __CLASS__));
                }
                @trigger_error('The "intention" option for the '.__CLASS__.' is deprecated since version 2.8 and will be removed in 3.0. Use the "csrf_token_id" option instead.', E_USER_DEPRECATED);
                $options['csrf_token_id'] = $options['intention'];
            }
Lines 51 through 60 in UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener.php are
intended to notify the change of config property names but the code never
reaches this point of execution because the property fails during the
configuration build process:  
symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener.php
Line 51 in 0450865
|  if (isset($options['intention'])) {  
---|---  
Additionally, MainConfiguration is intended to report configuration errors
related to the csrf_token_id property, but it does not:  
`743e670`
When clearing the cache, only the generic error message is reported, probably
because the configuration checks are in the wrong place in the hierarchy under
the function addFirewallsSection():
    [Symfony\Component\Config\Definition\Exception\InvalidConfigurationException]
    Unrecognized option "identity" under "security.firewalls.main.form_login"
To make matters worse, contributors believe that changes are "transparent"
when they are not. And the utility of MainConfiguration error checking is
diminished by not reporting the intended correction on the command line. This
is a systemic issue because there are 20 extra committed lines of unnecessary
code that do not support their own purpose, either the lines in
UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener should be reached because
MainConfiguration does not care about the superfluous setting, or
MainConfiguration should work as designed and report errors with config,
including using the console interface.
