How can I pwn thee?
● Born out of conversations at SECTOR
● Workforce is increasingly mobile and wireless
● Mobile users are away from your watchful 
BOFH eye (and punishment)
● How do you educate them, protect your 
company, protect yourself
● By no means and exhaustive list
● Full Disclosure
Meet Bob
● Bob works for widgets 
international
● Bob sells widgets
● Bob travels to 
customer sites
● Bob is your worst 
nightmare
Bob
● Bob likes to think 
himself tech savvy
● Bob really just knows 
enough to get access 
to pr0n
● Bob is widgets 
internationals worst 
enemy
● Bob is also the worst 
case scenario
Let me count the ways

● We won't touch Bob, 
just abuse wireless 
communication

long trips to a 
conference through 
international airports 
coming from another 
international 
conference in, say, 
Norway...
WiFi Threats
● Bob has a laptop with 
tons of private 
company info
● Bob likes to connect 
to hotspots at 
airports, train 
stations, hotels
● Bob connects to 
anything – Linksys 
Global Network
WiFi Threats
● Hotspots generally do not encrypt
● Cleartext = Clear to read = Clear to inject
– Images, Scripts, DNS, etc
● No VPN = certain pwn'age
● No firewall + browsable shares = pillage!
● MiTM attacks, password snarf
● Defcon 15 Hotel net
● Attacker is on the local net
● Driver Vulns
Norway experiment
● Airpwn inject 'alternate' images
● See if other continents were observant
● First image, not so much...
First Image
Norway Experiment
● Not many noticed
● A few scratched heads
● Lets up the ante
● Second image...
Second Image
They got the hint
I didn't get punched in the face (yay!)
WiFi Threats
● Karma, Hotspotter, 
Metasploit
● Hacking the friendly 
skies
● Cafe Latte exploit, 
recover company 
WEP keys
● De-auth headaches
● If it's on, it's probably 
pwn'able
Stopping WiFi Threats
● Disable Wifi when not in use
● Connect to network but use VPN for everything
● Assume your being attacked
● Don't trust customer nets either
● Turn on Firewall
● Be cautious
● TOR solves a fair number of problems in a 
pinch

phone
● Bob loves his 
Bluetooth headset
● Uses cell phone for 
SMS One Time Pads
● Keeps the companies 
private directory in his 
phone book
Bluetooth Threats
● If Bob's phone is on discoverable with default 
PIN, anyone can connect
● Paired devices get access to whole device
● Read/Write SMS, Phonebook, notes, images
● Remote AT commands on some models
● Premium rate calls
● Bob has to explain 9 hour call to Madame 
whipsalot's fun time party line on the company 
phone
Bluetooth Threats
Apologies to Major Malfunction
Bluetooth Threats

It is god!
I Hate Headsets
Eavesdropping on Headsets
Pwn'ing Bobs Wife
● While rummaging through Bob's phone, we 
make a discovery
● Some things should not be wirelessly enabled
● 'Special' SMS messages on Bobs phone, start 
sending on his behalf to his wife
● It's not discoverable but...
● Who thought this was a good idea?
'The Toy'
'The Toy'
● Bluetooth enabled 
vibrator, 'reacts' to 
special SMS 
messages when 
paired to a compatible 
phone
● Each character has 
it's own reaction
● thetoy.co.uk
Get the Innuendo out of the way
● 'Penetration Test'
● 'Rooting the Box without a trojan'
● 'Reach out and touch someone'
● 'Can you hear me now?'
● I can't wait to find one on a site survey.....
'The Toy'
● Teledildonics really needs some lessons in 
security
● An extreme example of a generally bad idea
● Serious implications here
● If Bob is not sending the messages, is it rape?
● Could non-printable characters cause 
potentially dangerous actions of the device?
● Seems funny, but is quite serious
Stopping Bluetooth threats
● Turn off Bluetooth or just discoverability
● Change default PIN
● If possible, limit access to paired devices
● Prompt for pairing
● Turn off headsets when not in use
● Consider the security implications of your 
devices
