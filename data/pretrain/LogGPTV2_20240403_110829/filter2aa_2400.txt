#### Introduction
"How can I pwn thee? Let me count the ways." This presentation was born out of conversations at SECTOR, focusing on the increasingly mobile and wireless workforce. As employees become more mobile, they often operate outside the watchful eye of IT security (BOFH). The challenge is to educate them, protect the company, and safeguard themselves.

#### Meet Bob
- **Bob works for Widgets International.**
- **He sells widgets and frequently travels to customer sites.**
- **Bob is your worst nightmare.**

##### Bob's Profile
- **Tech-Savvy (or so he thinks):** Bob believes he is tech-savvy but only knows enough to access pr0n.
- **Worst Enemy:** Bob is a significant threat to his company.
- **Worst Case Scenario:** He represents the most vulnerable and potentially damaging employee.

#### Let Me Count the Ways
- **Targeting Bob:** We will not physically harm Bob but will exploit his wireless communications.
- **Example Scenario:** Bored hackers on long trips through international airports, coming from conferences in Norway.

#### WiFi Threats
- **Bob's Laptop:** Contains tons of private company information.
- **Hotspots:** Bob connects to unsecured hotspots at airports, train stations, and hotels.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Cleartext Communication:** Hotspots generally do not encrypt, making data readable and injectable.
  - **No VPN:** Without a Virtual Private Network, Bob's data is easily compromised.
  - **No Firewall + Browsable Shares:** This allows attackers to pillage sensitive information.
  - **MiTM Attacks:** Man-in-the-Middle attacks, password snarfing, and other exploits.
  - **Defcon 15 Hotel Net:** Attackers can be on the local network, exploiting driver vulnerabilities.

##### Norway Experiment
- **Airpwn Injection:** Injecting 'alternate' images to see if other continents were observant.
- **Results:**
  - **First Image:** Not many noticed.
  - **Second Image:** They got the hint, and no one punched the presenter.

#### Tools and Exploits
- **Karma, Hotspotter, Metasploit:** Common tools for hacking wireless networks.
- **Hacking the Friendly Skies:** Cafe Latte exploit, recovering WEP keys, de-auth headaches.
- **General Rule:** If it's on, it's probably pwn-able.

#### Stopping WiFi Threats
- **Disable WiFi When Not in Use.**
- **Use a VPN for Everything.**
- **Assume You Are Being Attacked.**
- **Don't Trust Customer Networks.**
- **Turn On Your Firewall.**
- **Be Cautious.**
- **TOR:** Solves a fair number of problems in a pinch.

#### Bob's Phone
- **Cell Phone Usage:** Bob lives on his cell phone and loves his Bluetooth headset.
- **SMS One-Time Pads:** Uses his phone for secure messages.
- **Private Directory:** Keeps the company's private directory in his phone book.

##### Bluetooth Threats
- **Discoverable Mode:** If Bob's phone is discoverable with a default PIN, anyone can connect.
- **Paired Devices:** Access to the entire device, including SMS, phonebook, notes, and images.
- **Remote AT Commands:** Some models allow remote commands.
- **Premium Rate Calls:** Bob might have to explain an unauthorized 9-hour call to a fun-time party line.

##### Headset Vulnerabilities
- **Default PIN:** Bob's headset uses a default PIN, making it easy to bluebump and re-pair.
- **Eavesdropping:** Listening to conversations and injecting audio.
- **Boardroom Bug:** Making Bob think he's crazy.

#### Pwn'ing Bob's Wife
- **Special SMS Messages:** Sending inappropriate messages on Bob's behalf to his wife.
- **Bluetooth-Enabled Vibrator:** A toy that reacts to special SMS messages, raising serious security concerns.

##### Security Implications
- **Teledildonics:** Needs better security.
- **Serious Issues:** Potential for non-consensual actions and dangerous device behavior.

#### Stopping Bluetooth Threats
- **Turn Off Bluetooth or Discoverability.**
- **Change Default PIN.**
- **Limit Access to Paired Devices.**
- **Prompt for Pairing.**
- **Turn Off Headsets When Not in Use.**
- **Consider Security Implications.**

#### Bob's Keys
- **Proximity Card Key:** For office access, worn on a lanyard with his ID badge.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Unencrypted Prox Cards:** Easily cloned.
  - **DIY Cloner:** cq.cx for DIY prox card cloner.
  - **Traditional Keys:** Also vulnerable; photos can reveal bitting and keyway.

#### Bob's Passport
- **RFID Passports:** Easily readable with weak encryption.
- **US "Tin Foil Hat":** Not very effective.

#### Bob's Other Duties
- **Trade Shows:** Bob occasionally works trade shows.
- **Demo Widgets:** What happens when widgets accept unauthenticated commands?
- **USB Switchblade:** Pwn the demo laptop.
- **Shmoocon 2007:** Example of a marketing laptop being compromised.

#### Bob is Pwn'd
- **Laptop, Data, Cellphone, Wife, Keys, Demos, and Ability to Work:** All compromised.

#### Suggestions
- **Mobile Workforce Education:** What are you doing to help them help themselves?
- **Blackberry:** A different beast but worth exploring.
- **Wireless Presentation Mics and Wideband Jamming:** Additional considerations.

#### Conclusion
- **Questions, Comments, Accusations?**
