Question: You are reviewing the network security configuration of an Android application that targets API level 28. The application's requirement is to ensure secure network communication but also needs to maintain compatibility with a legacy system that uses clear traffic. How should you configure the application's network security to meet these requirements?
"A": "Set android:usesCleartextTraffic to 'true' in the application's manifest file to allow clear traffic connections.",
"B": "Modify the res/xml/network_security_config.xml file to define a domain-specific configuration that allows clear traffic for the legacy system.",
"C": "Disable TLS by default because it is not compatible with clear traffic connections.",
"D": "Enforce DNS over TLS globally to allow clear traffic for legacy systems."
Answer: B
