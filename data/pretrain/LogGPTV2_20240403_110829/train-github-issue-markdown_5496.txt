Since v0.0.6 of package jqueryui.TypeScript.DefinitelyTyped, there're
compilations errors when referencing jqueryui.d.ts. I tried v0.0.7 and I have
the same errors.
Signature for 'position' is duplicated  
Signature for 'hide' is duplicated  
Signature for 'show' is duplicated  
Signature for 'toggle' is duplicated
This is due to the pull request #552 that redefines some jquery methods. Could
you please fix the jQuery interface in the jqueryui.d.ts file since it already
references jquery.d.ts?
