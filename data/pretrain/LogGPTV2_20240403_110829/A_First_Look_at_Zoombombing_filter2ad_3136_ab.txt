**Table I: Overview of the ten online meeting services studied in this paper.**

In October 2019, we observed that one of these platforms remains highly popular, with many meeting links posted on social media. Companies like Zoom and Starleaf specialize in online communication services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced millions to work, learn, and socialize remotely, Zoom emerged as a leader, with over 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings. However, it also became a primary target for attacks, leading to the term "zoombombing."

### User Base

Most online meeting services are designed for business users. Hangouts is the only service specifically aimed at individuals, while five others cater to both business and individual users. Based on recent data (July 2020), four services—Zoom, Meet, Skype, and Webex—have a user base exceeding 100 million. We hypothesize that the size of a service's user base influences the frequency of attacks it faces.

### User Plans

Most online meeting services offer free accounts for individuals and small companies, with five of them providing paid plans that include additional features. GotoMeeting and Bluejeans, however, exclusively target business consumers, charging hosts $12/month and do not provide free accounts. Microsoft Teams' paid plans differ, as they are based on a per-user basis rather than per-host. Google Hangouts and Skype are free but charge for phone calls to local numbers.

### Features

We analyzed the features of each online meeting platform, focusing on security measures to prevent zoombombing. Table II provides an overview of the features offered by each platform.

#### Security Features

Eight out of the ten services require an account to join a meeting, which helps prevent unauthorized access and provides accountability. Only Jitsi and Zoom do not require registration to join, though Zoom allows hosts to require participants to have an account. Authentication typically involves anyone with an account and the meeting ID being able to join. To enhance security, Zoom, Webex, GotoMeeting, and Bluejeans allow hosts to set passwords. Only Zoom and Google Meet offer a waiting room feature for vetting participants. Zoom and Webex also provide a registration system with unique one-time links.

#### Participant Limits and Meeting Duration

All services under study have participant limits in their free versions. Zoom, Google Meet, and Webex limit meetings to 100 participants, while Teams supports only four attendees in its free version. For meeting duration, Zoom, Webex, and Starleaf limit free users to between 40 and 50 minutes.

### Data Collection and Analysis

#### Datasets

We describe the datasets used in this paper and our data collection process. We first discuss how we identify social media posts containing meeting URLs and then detail the online services we collected data from.

##### Identifying Posts with Meeting URLs

To find posts containing meeting URLs, we identified the DNS domain names and used regular expressions to filter alphanumeric characters and dots. We manually examined posts and found that Zoom meetings are often shared via a message containing the meeting ID and passcode, such as:

"Date: 03/24/2020 Time: 12:00PM Meeting ID: [ZOOM ID] Passcode: [ZOOM PASSWORD]"

We accounted for these posts by searching for patterns with "id" followed by at least nine consecutive digits, and including posts with the keyword "zoom."

##### 4chan

4chan is an imageboard where users start threads anonymously. It is organized into boards covering various interests. Threads are ephemeral, with only a fixed number active at any time. Previous research has shown that 4chan is a platform for abuse, including coordinated harassment. We developed a custom crawler to collect all posts between January 1, 2020, and July 24, 2020, identifying 47,221 posts from 434 threads with meeting URLs or IDs.

##### Twitter

Twitter is a microblogging platform where users can share public or private posts. Public tweets can be retweeted, and hashtags are used to create trends. Using the Twitter streaming API, we identified 12,077 tweets containing meeting links or IDs, posted between January 1, 2020, and July 18, 2020.

#### Ethics

This study involved publicly available data and did not require interactions with participants. We adhered to ethical principles and best practices, ensuring no further de-anonymization of users.

### Identifying Zoombombing Threads

While it is straightforward to find posts with meeting links, determining the intent behind the link is challenging. We expect most links to be benign, so we need a method to separate harmless posts from those calling for zoombombing. We developed a codebook to guide the thematic annotation process for our 4chan and Twitter datasets.

#### Codebook Development

1. **Initial Screening**: The authors independently screened the dataset and produced initial codes using thematic coding.
2. **Codebook Refinement**: We discussed and iterated on the initial codes until the codebook reached stability.
3. **Agreement Testing**: Annotators rated a portion of the dataset to ensure good agreement.
4. **Final Annotation**: The rest of the dataset was split, and each annotator labeled a portion.

#### Phase I: Labeling Zoombombing Content

We first identified posts and threads containing invitations to zoombomb. We randomly selected 10 threads from 434 threads with meeting links, and the authors agreed on two bombing threads and eight non-bombing threads. We then tested each author's ability to independently identify bombing threads by labeling 20 additional threads. We found perfect agreement (κ = 1.0) among the authors.

From the full 434 threads, 123 were identified as bombing threads. Nearly half (43.96%) of Zoom links and a majority (59.72%) of Google Meet links appeared in bombing threads. Google Hangouts and Skype links were mostly posted with benign intentions.

For Twitter, we restricted our analysis to English tweets, leaving us with 3,510 candidate tweets. Given the different nature of Twitter, we were stricter in determining if a tweet was a bombing invitation.

**Figure 2: Ratio of bombing and non-bombing threads on 4chan.**

### Example Invitations

- **4chan Bombing Invitation**:
  "Ok retards, this is an id of a zoom web lessons. Do your worst [ZOOM PASSWORD]. [ZOOM ID]"
  
- **Twitter Bombing Invitation**:
  "Raid this class as fast as u can.... #zoomcodes #zoomclasscodes #zoomclass #zoom [ZOOMURL]"

By being conservative and strict, we ensured accurate identification of zoombombing content.
