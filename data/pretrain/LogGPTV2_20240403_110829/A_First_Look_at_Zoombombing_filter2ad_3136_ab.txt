Table I: Overview of the ten online meeting services studied in this paper.
in October 2019, we will later show that this platform is still
very much used and many meeting links to it are posted on
social media. There are also companies that focus on online
communication services, like Zoom and Starleaf. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, where millions of people have been
forced to work, learn, and socialize remotely, Zoom has risen
to the top, with over 300 million daily participants in virtual
meetings, and has also become the top target of attack; hence
the phrase “zoombombing.”
User base. Most of the online meeting services are aimed at
business users. While Hangouts is the only service speciﬁcally
devoted to individuals, ﬁve of them are geared towards both
business and individual users. Based on the most current
data [8, 18, 38, 43] (July 2020), four of the online meeting
services have a user base of over 100M (Zoom, Meet, Skype,
and Webex). We hypothesize that the user base of a service
plays a role in which services face the most attacks.
User plan. Most online meeting services provide free accounts
for individuals and small companies, with ﬁve of them allow-
ing paid plans that provide additional features. GotoMeeting
and Bluejeans, however, exclusively target business consumers
(charging hosts $12/month) and do not provide free accounts.
Teams paid plans are somewhat different, as they are not
based on a per-host basis, but on a per-user basis. Google
Hangouts and Skype are free, but charge for phone calls to
local numbers.
Features. We next analyze the features that are speciﬁc to
each online meeting platform, with a particular focus on the
security measures that they put in place to prevent zoom-
bombing. To this end, we compare the features offered to free
accounts. Since GotoMeeting and Bluejeans do not provide
free accounts, we list the features that they offered to paid
customers in this section. An overview of the features offered
by each platform is reported in Table II.
First, we look at the security features offered by the meeting
platforms. Eight of the ten services require an account to join a
meeting. This is done to prevent attackers from ﬂooding meet-
ing rooms and provide some accountability, e.g., suspending
misbehaving accounts. Only Jitsi and Zoom do not require a
registration to join meetings, although Zoom hosts allow hosts
to require participants to have an account in order to join.
Authentication-wise,
the security model of online meeting
services is the following: anyone with an account on the
platform and who knows the meeting ID can join the meeting.
This is not dissimilar to other security sensitive services
that have been studied by the community in the past, from
online document editing [27] to ﬁle download platforms [30].
To prevent anyone knowing the meeting ID from joining
a room, Zoom, Webex, GotoMeeting, and Bluejeans allow
hosts to specify a password participants need to provide upon
joining. Only Zoom and Google Meet allow a waiting room
for hosts to vet the identity of participants. Google Meet
automatically admits participants whose accounts are included
in the invitation list into the meeting room and puts others in a
waiting room, where the host can let them in manually. Only
Zoom and Webex provide a registration system with one-time
unique links per registrant, which can help restrict and trace
participants. Generally, other meeting services use unique links
for each meeting, with Google Hangouts and Google Meet
allowing a link to be reused within a 90 day period. Skype
does not have a one time unique link function. Due to privacy
concerns, Google Meet, Google Hangouts, and Jitsi do not
allow hosts to mute all participates [20, 25]. Google Meet
only allows educational accounts to mute participants [19].
Second, we look at whether services limit the number of
users that can join a meeting, as well as the maximum duration
of a meeting for free users. All the services under study have
a participant limit in their free version. Zoom, Google Meet,
and Webex limit meetings to 100 participants, and Teams only
supports four attendees in its free version. When looking at the
maximum duration of a meeting, we ﬁnd that three services
(Zoom, Webex, and Starleaf) limit meetings to between 40 and
50 minutes for free users.
III. DATASETS
In this section, we describe the datasets use in this paper as
well as our data collection process. We ﬁrst discuss how we
identify social media posts containing links to meeting rooms.
We then discuss the online services we collect data from.
Identifying posts containing meeting URLs. To ﬁnd posts
that contain meeting URLs on the online services we monitor,
we ﬁrst identify the their DNS domain names. To avoid simple
evasion attempts, we use regular expressions that only consider
alphanumeric characters and dots. We manually examine posts
and ﬁnd that Zoom meetings are often not shared via a URL,
but rather via a message containing the meeting ID, which
users can input in the Zoom application to join, like in the
following example:

Table II: Comparison of the features offered by the online meeting services studied in this paper to free accounts. Services marked with *
do not provide a free version and are only available to hosts who pay a subscription.
“Date: 03/24/2020 Time: 12:00PM Meeting ID:
[ZOOM ID] Passcode: [ZOOM PASSWORD]”
To account for these posts, after lowercasing and removing
non-alphanumeric characters, we search for a pattern with “id”
followed by at least nine consecutive digits by using regular
expressions. We then further ﬁlter these by only including
posts with the keyword “zoom” in them.
4chan. 4chan [36] is an imageboard where users start a
thread anonymously, and other users comment on it. 4chan is
organized in boards that cover different special interests (e.g.,
Anime & Manga, Sports) or host more generic discussions
(e.g., Politically Incorrect, Random). Unlike traditional online
services, threads on 4chan boards are ephemeral: only a ﬁxed
number of threads is alive at any given time. Once a new
thread is created, the active thread that has least recently been
used is removed from the catalog of live threads. Previous
research showed that 4chan is a popular platform used by
miscreants to carry out abuse, e.g., organizing coordinated
harassment campaigns [23, 33, 36]. We therefore hypothesize
that zoombombing is widespread on the platform.
We develop a custom crawler following the same method-
ology of previous research on 4chan [23, 37], and collect all
posts between January 1st, 2020, and July 24th, 2020. We then
identify posts containing online meeting links and invitations
following the methodology discussed in the previous section.
Every time we identify a post containing information about a
meeting, we pull the entire thread. In total, we identify 47,221
posts from 434 threads with a URL or an ID for at least one
meeting platform room.
Twitter. Twitter [29] is a microblogging social media platform
on which registered users can share posts publicly or privately.
While private accounts can only reach their followers, public
accounts can reach any user on Twitter. The posts are called
“tweets” and can be re-shared (retweeted) by other users to
share with their followers. Tweets can contain “hashtags”
where users can put the “#” symbol at the beginning of a
word. By using the same hashtags, people can create trends,
which can also be used to look up tweets on the same topic.
Leveraging the Twitter streaming API, a public service that
provides a random 1% sample of all tweets posted worldwide,
we identify 12,077 tweets containing links or IDs to online
meeting rooms. These tweets were posted between January
1st, 2020, and July 18th, 2020. Note that due to limitations
in the Twitter API we could not retrieve any replies to tweets
containing meeting IDs.
Ethics. Since this work only involved publicly available data
and did not require interactions with participants, it is not
considered human subjects research by our institution. We
however acknowledge that data from social media is sensi-
tive, as it can contain personal information. In this study,
we adopted standard best practices to ensure that our study
followed ethical principles [2, 39] In particular, we did not try
to further de-anonymize any user.
IV. IDENTIFYING ZOOMBOMBING THREADS
include links to meetings,
While it is relatively straight forward to automatically ﬁnd
posts that
the challenge is in
determining the intent behind the link being posted, and in
particular whether the post
is calling for a zoombombing
attack. We expect that most meeting links on social media
are posted for benign reasons; therefore, to carry out this
study we need a way to separate harmless posts from those
that are calls for zoombombing. Since zoombombing is a
human driven phenomenon, developing automated techniques
to identify posts calling for attacks is challenging and prone
to false positives and false negatives. To avoid these issues,
we perform manual annotation based on thematic analysis of
all posts in our dataset, with the goal of identifying a reliable
ground truth dataset.
In this section, we develop a codebook to guide the thematic
annotation process for our 4chan and Twitter datasets. We
break the development of this codebook in two phases. First,
we perform a binary labeling to determine if posts are indeed
calls for zoombombing or not. As a second step, we further
characterize the posts and threads that contain zoombombing
invitations, with the goal of understanding the behavior of
attackers and the targets that they choose.
To build our codebook and perform annotation we fol-
low the same methodology described in recent security re-
search [47], in which the authors studied posts from online
inﬁdelity forums and their relation with intimate partner
surveillance tools and tactics. More precisely, we follow these
four steps:
1) The four authors of this paper independently screened
our dataset and produced initial codes using thematic
coding [5].

2) We then discussed these initial codes and went through
multiple iterations, using a portion of the data to build a
ﬁnal codebook. The process continued until the codebook
reached stability and additional iterations would not reﬁne
it further.
3) To investigate the common agreement on the codebook
by multiple annotators, we have them rate a portion of our
dataset and discuss disagreements until a good agreement
is reached.
4) We split the rest of our dataset and each annotator labels
one portion of it.
We next describe our process and our codebook in more detail.
Phase I: labeling zoombombing content
As we mentioned, the ﬁrst phase of our annotation process
deals with identifying social media posts and threads that
contain an invitation to zoombombing. We start by labeling
4chan threads. Following the methodology from [47], we
ﬁrst randomly choose 10 threads from the 434 threads that
contain a link to a meeting room, and have each author of
the paper review and discuss them together to build a shared
understanding of what a zoombombing invitation looks like.
From this initial dataset, the authors agreed that two threads
were “bombing” threads (i.e., they were encouraging/calling
for a zoombombing) while the remaining eight were not (i.e.,
“non-bombing”).
We then aim to test each author’s ability to independently
identify bombing threads. To this end, we chose 20 additional
threads (balanced as per the overall distribution of meeting
platform links on 4chan), and had each author label them
as either bombing or non-bombing. We used the following
deﬁnition to make a decision: a zoombombing thread should
include an invitation to bomb along with a URL to a meeting
room or a meeting ID. One interesting caveat here is that
while discussing the initial set of threads we noticed that the
invitation to bomb did not necessarily appear in the same post
as the meeting link itself, and thus we added the following
additional condition where applicable: the same user posted
the link or meeting ID and the textual invitation to bomb,
even if they were not in the same post. Note that although
users on 4chan are anonymous, users are given a unique ID
that identiﬁes them within the same thread [23]. It is important
to note that invitations to bomb are not necessarily explicit.
4chan’s users are well known to use coded language and
slang [33], and thus we relied on our domain expertise when
coding posts that include phrases like “you know what to do”
and “do ya thing.” Finally, because of the overall uncertainty
of things, we decide to be conservative and label any threads
we are unsure about as non-bombing. A typical bombing
invitation looks as follows:
“[ZOOMURL] My English class, come in and
trolley for a while.”
While a typical non-bombing invitation looks as fol-
lows:

The four authors of this paper independently coded each
thread to determine whether it was bombing related or not.
From this testing phase of 20 threads, we calculated Fleiss’
agreement score between the annotators and found perfect
agreement (κ = 1.0) [13, 14]. This indicates that all authors
were able to reliably identify zoombombing threads. From
here, we expand our annotation to the full dataset of 434
threads, split evenly between the four annotators.
In the end, we ﬁnd that 123 of the 434 threads in our
4chan dataset are bombing threads. As seen in Figure 2, nearly
half (43.96%) of the Zoom meeting links in our dataset were
determined to belong to a bombing thread, and a majority
(59.72%) of Google Meet links appeared in bombing threads.
On the other hand, Google Hangouts and Skype links are
mostly posted with benign intentions.
We followed the same labeling procedure for Twitter. From
our preliminary screening of the tweets, we ﬁnd that a large
portion are non-English. Thus, we use the “language” ﬁeld
provided by the Twitter API and restrict our analysis to only
English tweets from our total 12,077 tweets, which left us with
3,510 candidate tweets.
A challenge we faced when labeling tweets is that Twitter
is a much different platform than 4chan in its user base
and general tone. 4chan is dominated by trolling and irony,

and veiled calls to join meetings can often be interpreted
as bombing invitations. Here is an example of a bombing
invitation from 4chan:
“Ok retards, this is an id of a zoom web lessons.
Do your worst
[ZOOM PASS-
WORD].”
[ZOOM ID]
On the other hand, Twitter is a general audience social
network, therefore we expect most meeting invitations to be
benign. For example, this is a bombing invitation from Twitter:
“Raid this class as fast as u can....
#zoomcodes #zoomclasscodes #zoomclass #zoom
[ZOOMURL]”
To reﬂect this difference and avoid potential false positives,
we decided to be stricter when determining if a tweet is a
