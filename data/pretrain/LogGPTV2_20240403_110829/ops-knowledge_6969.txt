User: Please describe the basic process and differences of the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, and how to debug and troubleshoot problems from the network level.
Assistant: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are two common application layer protocols, which are used to transfer data between the client and the server, and implement requests and responses for resources such as web pages and pictures. The basic process of HTTP is: 1. The client sends a request message to the server, which contains the requested URI, request method (GET, POST, etc.) and request header; 2. The server receives the request message, according to the message 3. The client receives the response message and processes it according to the returned status code and response body. HTTPS adds the SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocol on the basis of HTTP, and ensures data security through encryption and authentication. The basic process of HTTPS is basically similar to HTTP, except that SSL/TLS layer processing is added when establishing a connection and transmitting data. To debug and troubleshoot problems at the network level, the following tools can be commonly used: 1. Network packet capture tools, such as Wireshark: can capture network packets, analyze HTTP/HTTPS protocol packets, view request and response content, header information, etc. ; 2. The developer tools that come with the browser, such as Chrome DevTools: You can view HTTP request and response information, request time and content, browser performance and page rendering, etc.; 3. Server logs: You can view the server-side processing request For more information, understand the processing status of the server; 4. SSL/TLS certificate tools, such as openssl: can check whether the certificate has expired or been revoked, and whether there are security issues such as man-in-the-middle attacks.
