Chapter 1. It’s a City Under Siege
This journey begins one late Monday afternoon at . Our team needs coffee, desperately, but none of us dare open the theater doors…During the , a script-happy warlock inadvertently released a legion of Wolpertingers! To leave now would mean code dismemberment and certain death.
Behold → the horror!
Figure 1. Wolpertinger, stuffedYou may not be familiar with these . Trust us, they’ll eat your shorts and suck loops from your code. In light of this danger, we’ve searched high and wide for the security crew’s defensive operations manual. We can’t find it and the DefOps [1: a portmanteau of “defensive” and“operations”] werewolves haven’t returned from their rendezvous at Bier Central. They’ve either eaten each other or fallen victim to the Wolpertingers roaming the streets of Antwerp. Quick, hit Ctrl+Alt+Backspace or select File › Quit and let’s bail out of here! Working with werewolves leads to howling and trying to train aggressive regular expressions with Pavlovian reinforcement.
Weak light from the hallway trickled across the theater, chased by a distant scream.

Come on, Bier Central. Did you have to ask? If you beat me there, I’ll take a .

OMG! Somebody please save us now! I want my mum — and an extra-large double macchiato, please.Unfortunaly, Lazarus and I had both come to the conclusion that we weren’t going to get out of this without corrupted hardrives if we didn’t locate caffeine within the next few hours.

Steps for finding and preparing Burdockian leaves 
1. Locate dusty botany

	a. Sneeze 
	i. Sneeze some more 
2. Find section on Burdockian 
	a. Review its characteristics 
	i. Take a picture of the diagram of its leaves 
	A. Don’t rip out the picture like a troglodyte 
	I. Don’t do it, I’m watching you 
3. Put on your hiking boots 
4. Freeze your butt off on the side of a mountain at midnight

How about a list with some terms?How about a list with some terms?
• Fruits
Apple 
The round fruit of a tree of the rose family, which typically has thin red or green skin and crisp flesh. Yes, I said flesh.
Pear 
A yellowish- or brownish-green edible fruit that is typically narrow at the stalk and wider toward the base, with sweet, slightly gritty flesh. More flesh. Mmmmm.
• Vegetables
Carrot• Vegetables
Carrot 
	An orange-colored root eaten as a vegetable. Beware, it’s a favorite of the Wolpertinger.
Are You Still Here?
 Move, move, move!
The Wolpertingers can smell your procrastination. It’s not their fault you can’t find your boots.
Sigh…

Chapter 3. Dawn on the Plateau5
Chapter 3. Dawn on the Plateau 
Lazarus was hanging from the bottom limb of a Burdockian tree, licking the bark. 	On pavements and the bark of trees I have found whole worlds.
— Mark Tobey
“If there are whole worlds on that bark, he just swallowed them,” Kizmet replied. 	No bark was harmed in the making of this potion.
 We’re not so sure about a couple ants though.
 Nor those worlds…Nor those worlds…
	 Crap, I smell an injunction.
— The documentation attorneys
We’d retrieved the leaves, but we’d obviously lost our minds in the process. 	Roses are red.
Violets are blue-ish.

Chapter 4. Words Seasoned with Power
To tame the wild wolpertingers we needed to build a charm. But ultimate victory could only be won if we divined the true name of the warlock.“What kind of charm?” Lazarus asked. “An odoriferous one or a mineral one?” Kizmet shrugged.“The note from Olaf’s desk says ‘wormwood and licorice,’ but these could be normal groceries for werewolves.”
“Well the H2O written on the security whiteboard could be part of a shopping list, but I don’t think the local bodega also sells e = mc 2,” Lazarus replied.“Wait!” Indigo plucked a small vial from her desk’s top drawer and held it toward us. The vial’s label read ‘e = mc2the scent of sciencesmells like a genius’.
4.1. Can I Get Some Code?
Sure.
Have a listing block.
| This is an example of a listing block.

But I’m not giving you any highlighting shazam just yet.
What is a listing block?What is a listing block?
Like literal blocks, the content in listing blocks is displayed exactly as you entered it. Listing
block content is rendered as  text.
The listing style is applied to an element, such as a paragraph, by setting the listing
attribute on that element.
Let’s get our highlighting on!

Where could we go without some Java? Naturally, some autosizing is necessary.

Chapter 5. Keeping It Together
On this page we have nested “keep together” logic. The combined block will be shifted to the next page if there isn’t room available on this one.
First, 
we 
need 
to 
waste 
several 
lines 
using 
a 
verse 
to 
push 
the 
next 
block 
to 
its 
breaking 
point.

What happens if there is both a field and a method with the same name?Back to the previous example, suppose that we have both a field and a method with the same name, as in:
Listing 3. Java class with a field and method that share the same name
publicclassFoo { 
	public String bar;
|  | 	public String bar() { 
	return bar;
	 } 
}
Golo resolves methods first, fields last. Hence, the following Golo code will |
|---|---||---|---|
|  |	public String bar() {  	return bar; 	 }  } Golo resolves methods first, fields last. Hence, the following Golo code will |
resolve the bar() method, not the bar field:
Listing 4. Golo picks the method over the field with the same name
let foo = Foo()
foo: bar("baz") ①
println(foo: bar()) ②
① Writes the field 
② Calls the bar() method
