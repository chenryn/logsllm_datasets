**Description of the Issue:**
I have set up a monitoring system using Monit to watch the `kubelet` and `flanneld` services. The `kubelet` service is dependent on the `flanneld` service. When I intentionally stopped the `flanneld` service, `kubelet` was restarted by Monit multiple times. After fixing the `flanneld` service, `kubelet` failed to start with the following error:

```
E1123 14:47:21.372435   24479 kubelet.go:2675] Failed to check if disk space is available for the runtime: failed to get fs info for "runtime": unable to find data for container /

...
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- `kubelet` should start successfully after the `flanneld` service is fixed.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Set up Monit to monitor `kubelet` and `flanneld` services.
2. Ensure that `kubelet` depends on `flanneld`.
3. Stop the `flanneld` service.
4. Observe `kubelet` being restarted by Monit.
5. Fix the `flanneld` service.
6. Check the status of `kubelet`.

**Additional Information:**
- Logs from the `kubelet` service showing the error:
