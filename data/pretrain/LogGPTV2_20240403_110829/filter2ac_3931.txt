**ATT&CK ID:** S0182  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** FinFisher

FinFisher employs multiple layers of obfuscation to evade detection and analysis. One notable technique is the use of "spaghetti code" within its functions, which is designed to confuse disassembly tools and make reverse engineering more difficult. Additionally, FinFisher incorporates a custom XOR algorithm to further obfuscate its code, enhancing its resistance to static and dynamic analysis.
