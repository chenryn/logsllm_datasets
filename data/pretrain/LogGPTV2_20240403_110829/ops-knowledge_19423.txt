Subject: Seeking IDE with Code Completion for IronPython on Linux

Dear Support Team,

I have been searching for an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that offers code completion (IntelliSense) for IronPython on Linux systems, particularly Ubuntu. My research has led me to references suggesting that both MonoDevelop and Eclipse (with the PyDev plugin) support IronPython. However, I have not been able to get either of these IDEs to work as expected.

Could you please clarify if MonoDevelop and PyDev only provide IronPython code completion features on Windows? If this is not the case, are there any detailed installation guides or resources that I can follow to successfully set up and use these IDEs on Ubuntu or other Linux distributions?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Chris

Dear Chris,

Thank you for reaching out.

Regarding your query, while Eclipse with the PyDev plugin does offer some level of support for IronPython, it may not be fully functional or optimized for Linux environments. As for MonoDevelop, currently, there is no specific add-in available for IronPython. 

If you or anyone else is interested in contributing to the development of an IronPython add-in for MonoDevelop, we encourage you to contact the MonoDevelop mailing list. They can provide guidance and support on how to get started with such a project.

In the meantime, you might want to consider using alternative tools or IDEs that have better support for IronPython on Linux. Some options include:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: With the appropriate extensions, VS Code can provide a robust environment for IronPython development.
2. **Sublime Text**: Using plugins like SublimeCodeIntel, you can achieve some level of code completion and other helpful features.

We hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please feel free to reach out.
