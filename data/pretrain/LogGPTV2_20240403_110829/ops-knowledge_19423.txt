User: I've been searching for an IDE with code completion (intellisence) for IronPython on Linux systems (typically Ubuntu).
I've found references to MonoDevelop and Eclipse (PyDev) supporting IronPython, but I can't get any of them to work.
Is this because MonoDevelop and PyDev only support IronPython code completion on Windows? Are there any installation guides that I could follow to make these IDEs work on Ubuntu / Linux.
Many thanks for your help,
Chris
Assistant: I don't know about Eclipse, but there isn't currently an IronPython addin for MonoDevelop. If anyone's interested in developing one, please contact the MonoDevelop mailing list for advice on getting started.
