User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Kubernetes stuck on ContainerCreating A pod in my Kubernetes cluster is stuck on "ContainerCreating" after running a create. How do I see logs for this operation in order to diagnose why it is stuck? kubectl logs doesn't seem to work since the container needs to be in a non-pending state.

Assistant: kubectl describe pods will list some (probably most) of the events associated with the pod, including pulling of images, starting of containers.
