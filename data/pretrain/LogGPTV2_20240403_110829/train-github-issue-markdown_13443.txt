I encountered issues when using the `@types/requirejs` package. Below are the relevant details:

### `package.json`
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@syncfusion/ej2-build": "*",
    "@types/chai": "^3.4.28",
    "@types/jasmine": "2.8.9",
    "@types/jasmine-ajax": "^3.1.27",
    "@types/requirejs": "^2.1.31"
  }
}
```

### Compilation Error
When I attempt to compile my application, the following error is thrown:

```
[11:47:10] Starting 'scripts-gen'...
D:/workspace/components/ej2-button-components/node_modules/@types/requirejs/index.d.ts(396,13): 
error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type. Variable 'require' must be of type 'NodeRequire', but here has type 'Require'.
[11:47:23] 'scripts-gen' errored after 12 s

```

### Environment
