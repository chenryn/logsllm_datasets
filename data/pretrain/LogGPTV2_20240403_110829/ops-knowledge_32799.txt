User: I have recently taken up learning networks, and I want to install scapy.
I have downloaded the latest version (2.2.0), and have two versions of python on my computer- 2.6.1 and 3.3.2. My OS is windows 7 64 bit.
After extracting scapy and navigating to the correct folder in the terminal, I was instructed to run "python setup.py install". I get the following error-  

File "setup.py", line 35
  os.chmod(fname,0755)
  ................................^
  ......................invalid
  token

(dots for alignment)
How do I solve this problem?
Assistant: Change os.chmod(fname,0755) to os.chmod(fname,0o755) and re-run
