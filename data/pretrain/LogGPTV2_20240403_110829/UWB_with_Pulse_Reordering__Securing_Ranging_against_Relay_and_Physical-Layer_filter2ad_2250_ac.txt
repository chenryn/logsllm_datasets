B. Proof-of-concept implementation
We evaluated UWB-PR in a prototype system transmitting
OOK UWB pulses at a system bandwidth of 500MHz. The
pulses are sent at a peak pulse repetition frequency (PRF)
of 4MHz,
i.e., with a spacing of 250ns. In terms of the
regulatory transmission power constraints, this places UWB-
PR in the regime dominated by the average constraint of -
41.3dBm/MHz6 [14].
The link budget of the resulting system depends on the
number of pulses per symbol. Our implementation provides
for a UWB base pulse g.
6This corresponds to -14.3dBm over the entire system bandwidth.

for pulse detection, i.e. its success depends purely on receiver
conﬁguration. The only remaining option for an attacker to
reduce the distance measured is by advancing the signals
representing the nonces (nV E and nP R), i.e. by means of
an ED/LC attack.
Since UWB-PR relies on a distance commitment for dis-
tance measurement, the attacker has to advance both preamble
and payload data. The preamble is no secret and the attacker
can send it in advance. However, the payload is cryptograph-
ically generated. Upon locking to the preamble, the receiver
samples the payload pulses at speciﬁc times. The attack is
only successful if the pulses sent by the attacker at these very
instants yield the same correlation output at the receiver as the
legitimate pulses.
The ED/LC attack required to advance the payload bits in-
volves the attacker predicting part of the symbol. Conventional
multi-pulse UWB systems help an attacker with that due to
their predictable symbol structure.
In UWB-PR, on the other hand, the pulses representing NB
bits are reordered and their polarity is XORed with a secret
sequence. An attacker does not know the pulse-to-bit mapping
and the polarity of the pulses, but can only try to guess this
information. Guessing allows an attacker to send his pulse
before observing the corresponding legitimate pulse. As we
do not place any limit on the attacker’s reception capabilities,
we assume that he can resolve the legitimate signal at the pulse
level. As a consequence, the attacker obtains feedback on the
correctness of his pulse-guess immediately, before transmitting
the next pulse. Moreover, we assume that the decision of the
receiver only depends on the attacker signal, i.e. the effect of
the legitimate signal being negligible. This reﬂects a scenario
where the legitimate prover is not in the vicinity of the veriﬁer.
An attacker guessing a polarity sequence PA, transmitted with
a sequence of power levels A, results for the k-th bit in the
receiver statics
A = (cid:107)g(cid:107)2(cid:104)APA, ˜P (0,...,bk,0,...)(cid:105).
σk
The attack on the entire group of bits is successful iff
sign(σk
A) = sign(σk), ∀k ∈ (0, ..., NB − 1),
i.e. all bits decoded at the receiver based on the statistics
produced by the attacker signal match the legitimate bits.
Without reordering and pulse blinding, the attacker knows
the value of a bit after observing a small part of the symbol. As
will be introduced in the following, in UWB-PR, the guessing
attacker’s knowledge is only probabilistic.
A. Attacker Knowledge
Since the secret reordering and blinding sequences are
chosen randomly for each transmission, an attacker cannot
learn anything by observing multiple frames. Therefore, the
evolution of an attacker’s knowledge is conﬁned to the speciﬁc
pulse sequence within a single frame.

iments do not suggest any effect of the blinding and reordering operations on
the bit error rate.
us with an equivalent link budget7 of about 79dB if it relies
on a single pulse per bit. Within this margin, it can tolerate
additional losses due to distance and shadowing. For instance,
this conﬁguration would allow operations up to distances
of approximately 32m under LoS conditions. Robustness of
signal transmission and, in turn, the maximum operating range
can be further improved by increasing the number of pulses
per bit.
For the experimental evaluation, we relied on 16 pulses per
bit. This improves the link budget by 9dB to 88dB and results
in an almost threefold maximum operating distance of 93m.
There is no fundamental limitation to even longer symbols and
corresponding distance improvements.
We evaluated the bit error rate for both a standard 802.15.4f-
mode (i.e., without reordering) and a UWB-PR-mode relying
on blinding and reordering over groups of four bits. Figure
8 shows our experimental setup. As the reordering can be
conﬁgured in our prototypes, we were able to use the same
hardware for both runs. The results for the bit error rate as
presented in Figure 9 do not indicate any difference between
legacy and UWB-PR systems. We also note that the ranging
precision of 10cm (LoS) is not affected by the reordering
operation since the distance measurement is executed on the
preamble in both cases and is therefore independent of this
operation.
VI. SECURITY ANALYSIS
UWB-PR is designed with the goal to provide performant
ranging while guaranteeing quantiﬁable security against an
external attacker. In particular, such an attacker should not
succeed in reducing the distance between two mutually trusted
parties, be it by means of a relay or by conducting any other
physical-layer attack. A well designed ToF distance-bounding
protocol is inherently resistant to a relay attack. Moreover, a
Cicada attack can be prevented by limiting the search window

likelihood > 0.01 per attempt.

the attacker knows all his past contributions in terms of
transmission power and polarity as well as the true pulse
polarities sent by the legitimate transmitter. Therefore, the
attacker knows at each time all his past contributions to the
bit-wise decision statistics σk
A, k ∈ {1, ..., NB}, at the receiver.
We call all the time-wise contributions by the attacker to a
particular frame at time t the attack sequence and deﬁne it as
S = (s1, ..., st),
where the contribution at time k is
sk = A[k] · PA[k] · ˜P (b1,...,bNB )[k].
As the attacker proceeds through the attack (i.e, the frame),
after each pulse transmission and subsequent disclosure of the
actual pulse polarity, he is able to update his knowledge by
appending the most recent correlation contribution

to the existing attack sequence.
b) Attack State: Although the attacker sees each correla-
tion contribution during the course of the attack, he is uncertain
as to which bit each value contributes to. Therefore, what
we call the attack state; the bit-wise intermediate correlation
result, is in general not known to the attacker. However, the
attacker can model the attack state as a random variable with
a distribution based on the attack sequence. The uncertainty
stems from the random reordering, each of which is equally
likely from the attacker’s point of view. This way, the attack
state (σ1, ..., σNB ) can be modeled as the joint distribution of
all NB bit-wise correlations, each of which can be sampled
as
σk =
(cid:122)
NB bits
(...(cid:107)0, ..., 0(cid:107) 1, ..., 1

(cid:107)0, ..., 0(cid:107)...)(cid:105), π U AR← Π,
given a reordering π drawn uniformly at random and some
attack sequence S. Sampling each of the NB correlation values
for many reorderings allows the attacker to approximate the
probability distribution of the attack state.
k-th bit
If the attacker is in a state with all bit-wise correlations
strictly positive, he has won. Therefore, we call these states
winning states.
c) Current Advantage Pwin: Given some attack sequence
and the corresponding state distribution, the attacker is inter-
ested in his chances of having already won. This probability
we call the attacker’s current advantage. Having obtained the
probability distribution over all states for an attack sequence
S, we can ﬁnd the current advantage simply by summing the
probabilities of all winning states:(cid:88)

Fig. 10. The knowledge of a guessing attacker can be split into his assessment
of the past and his model of the future.
This number essentially represents the attacker’s conﬁdence
interferences. Because of the reordering being
in his past
unknown,
the attacker is in general not able to tell with
certainty whether he has already won or not.
d) Future Opportunity P win: At each time during the
attack, the attacker can try to look ahead and consider all future
progressions of the attack sequence. This involves building a
model that serves to estimate his chances of winning if he
continues playing. Evaluating this future opportunity helps
the attacker in two ways. First,
it allows the attacker to
choose his next transmission power optimally, in particular as
the argument maximizing the future opportunity conditioned
on this choice. Second, by comparing the future opportunity
against the current advantage, an attacker can make an in-
formed stopping decision during the attack. This means that,
if the expected chances in the next step are, irrespective of the
current energy level choice, worse than the current advantage,
the attacker will stop interfering. In any case, building a model
for estimating the future opportunity is very complex as it
contains uncertainty about the current state, the reordering as
well as the future pulse polarities and requires the attacker to
essentially simulate his own behavior for the entire remaining
pulse sequence. Due to the random reordering and pulse
blinding, the only information the attacker has about the future
is the number of pulses remaining as well as some partial
knowledge about the current attack state.
B. Attack Strategies
The knowledge that
informs the strategy of a guessing
attacker can be split into past observations and a model for
the future, as illustrated in Figure 10. However, as discussed
previously, the guessing attacker’s knowledge about future
pulses is very limited. We, therefore, argue that any strategy
an attacker employs to maximize his success chances is
predominantly based on his assessment of the past, i.e. the
probability of having won Pwin. This value will evolve during
the attack based on the attacker’s guessing luck and the power
levels he chooses for his pulses. In terms of strategy, we argue
that an attacker’s ‘degrees of freedom’ is given by a) his
decision when to terminate the attack and b) the power levels
chosen for the pulses. In our model, for the former, we choose
an over-approximation on the attacker’s knowledge informing

of success. This allows compensating for the detrimental effects of longer symbols (higher NP ) on security.

DEPENDING ON THE ATTACKER AND CONFIGURATION OF UWB-PR, DIFFERENT MINIMUM NONCE LENGTHS ARE REQUIRED TO DRIVE THE OVERALL

extreme strategies. A Single-Power attacker that keeps his
transmission level constant throughout the attack and a Multi-
Power attacker that is not limited in the number of power levels
to choose from. We introduce these choices in the following.
Optimal Attack Termination As the knowledge about the
future is very limited, an attacker is in particular not able to
anticipate if a certain probability of winning can be achieved
at any time in the future. As an over-approximation for the
