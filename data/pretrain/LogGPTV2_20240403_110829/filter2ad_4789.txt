Message from the PDS Program Chair 
Welcome to the 2013 Performance and Dependability Symposium (PDS) in Budapest! 
PDS is a well-recognized, major international forum for researchers and practitioners to present innovative, 
high-quality  results  in  the  analysis  and  assessment  of  computer  systems  and  networks  in  terms  of  their 
performance,  dependability,  and  security.  As  much  as  the  considered  systems  vary  from  extremely  small 
embedded devices and hardware components to large scale networked systems and infrastructures, so do the 
properties  of  interest  with  various  aspects  of  performance,  dependability,  and  security  and  the  assessment 
approaches ranging from empirical and experimental studies to refined mathematical modeling methods. This 
year,  we  received  113  submissions  (95  regular  papers,  11  practical  experience  reports,  and  7  tool 
descriptions) from 20 countries, covering various facets of research and practice on these topics. 
The review and selection process followed the tradition of thoroughness and rigor of DSN.  Every effort was 
made to ensure that submissions were solely evaluated based on their scientific merits.  
With the double-blind process, reviewers did not know authors and their affiliations throughout the selection 
process.  Each  paper  received three  to  five  reviews in  two  rounds of  reviewing where  the  first  round  with 
three  reviews  served  as  a  preselection  phase.  Authors  were  given  the  opportunity  to  provide  feedback  to 
reviews and answer questions raised by the reviewers before the PC meeting. Discussions among reviewers 
took place online ahead of the PC meeting to recognize and resolve open issues. The authors’ rebuttals and 
the  reviews  were  thoroughly  discussed  electronically  through  the  START  conference  management  system 
and  during  the  PC  meeting  at  the  University  of  Maryland,  on  February  18-19,  well  attended  by  32  PC 
members. The selection process was very competitive. We accepted 25 papers (22 regular papers, 2 practical 
experience reports, and 1 tool description). The overall acceptance rate was 22 %. 
First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  authors  who  submitted  their  work  to  PDS.  I  believe  that  the 
reviewing process provided valuable feedback to all authors regardless of the decision to accept or reject a 
particular submission. I also express my deep gratitude to the 40 PC members who devoted their time and 
provided  their  expertise  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  reviewing  and  the  selection  process.  I  am  also  very 
grateful to the external reviewers for their outstanding help and assistance in the review process. PC members 
and reviewers provide an invaluable service to our community to make this venue the forum of choice to 
present solid and strong results in our field. 
The support received from the DSN General Chair (András Pataricza), the DSN Steering Committee Chair 
and Vice-Chairs (Neeraj Suri and Rick Schlichting in 2012, Roberto Baldoni and Paulo Verissimo in 2013) is 
very  much appreciated. The cooperation with the DCCS Program Chair (George Candea) was stimulating 
and effective. Special thanks go to Michel Cukier for sharing his experiences from being PDS PC Chair in 
2012 as well as for his kind support to host the PC meeting at the University of Maryland. Several SC and 
many PC members provided their feedback and guidance, in particular Peter Buchholz, Susanna Donatelli, 
Mohamed Kaâniche, and Bill Sanders, which I thankfully acknowledge here. 
  Thank you for attending this year's DSN. I hope that you will find the program intellectually stimulating 
and that you also reserved some extra time to enjoy the historical and cultural highlights of Budapest.
