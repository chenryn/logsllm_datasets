## Abstract
Despite the growing attention to the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), there remains a significant gap in comprehending the malicious strategies, aims, and intentions of attackers. This paper uniquely leverages passive monitoring and analysis of a newly deployed network telescope IP address space to build a broad understanding of real CPS maliciousness. Specifically, we infer, investigate, characterize, and report on large-scale probing activities targeting over 20 diverse and widely used CPS protocols.

To facilitate this analysis, we first develop and evaluate a novel probabilistic model to filter out noise embedded in network telescope traffic. We then generate comprehensive statistics, inferences, and insights characterizing these scanning activities, including probe types, source distribution, and packet headers. Additionally, we propose and empirically evaluate an innovative hybrid approach combining time-series analysis and context-triggered piecewise hashing to infer, characterize, and cluster orchestrated and well-coordinated probing activities targeting CPS protocols from Internet-scale unsolicited sources.

Our analysis, based on extensive network telescope data observed over a recent one-month period, reveals approximately 33,000 probes targeting various CPS protocols. Notably, there is a lack of interest in UDP-based CPS services, with a prevalence of probes towards ICCP and Modbus protocols. We also find that 74% of CPS probes were persistent throughout the analyzed period, targeting prominent protocols such as DNP3 and BACnet. Furthermore, we uncover nearly 9,000 large-scale, stealthy, and previously undocumented orchestrated probing events targeting several CPS protocols. These findings are validated through cross-referencing with publicly available threat repositories.

We conclude that the proposed approaches, techniques, and methods provide a solid foundation for better understanding real CPS malicious objectives and intents.

## I. Introduction
Critical infrastructure systems, including those in aerospace, automotive, energy, healthcare, and manufacturing, are essential for the broader health, safety, security, and economic well-being of modern society. These systems are increasingly being transformed by the integration of "smart" cyber-based technologies to improve their efficiency and reliability. The resulting integrated systems, known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), present unique opportunities for economic growth and quality of life improvement. For example, in the transportation sector, CPS can enable zero-fatality highways through automated accident prevention and congestion reduction. In the healthcare sector, CPS can support cost-effective healthcare and timely disease diagnosis and prevention.

However, the complexity arising from the fusion of computational and physical processes in CPS poses substantial security challenges. New vulnerabilities and attack models emerge, making it difficult to infer, characterize, attribute, and analyze attacks. Historical events, such as the exploitation of control systems at Idaho National Laboratories and the Stuxnet malware, highlight the risks to critical infrastructures. Recent reports from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) indicate a rise in highly-tailored and specifically engineered CPS attacks.

While numerous research efforts have been dedicated to CPS security, a significant gap remains in understanding and characterizing the capabilities, intents, and aims of malicious attackers. This gap is largely due to the lack of real malicious empirical data from operational CPS environments. To address this, we offer a comprehensive analysis of probing activities targeting CPS communication and control protocols by passively monitoring and characterizing network traffic directed at a newly deployed network telescope IP address space. Our work is innovative in its ability to design, implement, and evaluate automated approaches to disclose real CPS attackers' strategies.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
1. **Probabilistic Model for Noise Filtering**: We propose a formal preprocessing probabilistic model to filter out misconﬁguration traffic from darknet data. This model does not rely on arbitrary cut-off thresholds, provides different likelihood models, and captures the natural behavior of misconﬁguration traffic.
2. **Multidimensional Investigation of Probing Activities**: We infer, characterize, and investigate probing activities targeting over 20 CPS protocols. We study trends, abuse per protocol, probes' co-occurrences, source countries, and employed protocols. We also propose a hybrid approach combining temporal analysis and context-triggered piecewise hashing to detect orchestrated and well-coordinated probing activities.
3. **Validation and Evaluation**: We validate our models, methods, and approaches using 50 GB of darknet data and corroborate our findings against publicly available threat repositories.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews related work in CPS security, probing analysis, and traffic measurements. Section III details our proposed approaches, methods, and techniques. Section IV presents the corresponding evaluations, inferences, and validations. Section V provides a discussion, and Section VI summarizes the paper and outlines future work.

## II. Related Work
In this section, we review the literature on CPS security approaches, probing analysis, and traffic measurement studies. We provide two distinct taxonomies: one from the physical/control perspective and another from the cybersecurity perspective. We also discuss the state-of-the-art in these areas and highlight research gaps that this paper aims to address.

### A. CPS Security: Control-Theoretic Approaches
Control-theoretic approaches to CPS security have received considerable attention. Table I provides a brief taxonomy of representative works in this area, focusing on the modeled systems, consideration of noise, attack models, and defense mechanisms.

| Type of System | Noise | Attack Models | Defense Mechanisms | Reference |
|----------------|-------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Power Grid     | ✓     | False data injection on sensors | Residue detector | [17] |
| Power Grid     | ✓     | False data injection on sensors | Residue detector | [18] |
| Control System | -     | Attacks on sensors & actuators | Detection filters | [19] |
| Control System | -     | Attacks on sensors & actuators | Optimization decoders | [6] |
| Wireless Network | ✓     | Replay attack | χ2 detector | [20] |
| Distributed Network | -     | State attacks | Output estimator | [21] |
| Sensor Network | ✓     | State attacks | Combinatorial estimator | [22] |
| Power Grid     | ✓     | Dynamic false data injection | Residue detector | [23] |

These works consider system dynamics from a physical point of view and often use mathematical models to predict and detect deviations. However, they do not provide concrete evidence that such deviations are malicious, depict attackers' models in a highly theoretical manner, and are often evaluated in emulated or simulated environments rather than real-world applications.

### B. CPS Security: Cybersecurity Approaches
Cybersecurity approaches to CPS security focus on detecting and mitigating cyber threats. These include intrusion detection systems, anomaly detection, and network traffic analysis. Table II provides a brief taxonomy of representative works in this area, focusing on the type of system, attack models, and defense mechanisms.

| Type of System | Attack Models | Defense Mechanisms | Reference |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Industrial Control Systems | Malware campaigns | Intrusion detection systems | [9] |
| SCADA Systems | Denial of service | Anomaly detection | [10] |
| Smart Grids | Data exfiltration | Network traffic analysis | [11] |
| Healthcare CPS | Ransomware | Endpoint protection | [12] |
| Automotive CPS | Remote code execution | Firewalls | [13] |

These works leverage various cybersecurity techniques to protect CPS but often lack a comprehensive understanding of real-world attack patterns and behaviors.

### C. Probing Analysis and Traffic Measurement Studies
Probing analysis and traffic measurement studies aim to understand and characterize network traffic, particularly in the context of darknet and network telescopes. These studies often involve the collection and analysis of unsolicited traffic to identify and characterize malicious activities. Table III provides a brief taxonomy of representative works in this area, focusing on the type of system, data collection method, and analysis techniques.

| Type of System | Data Collection Method | Analysis Techniques | Reference |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Darknet | Network telescope | Statistical analysis | [16] |
| Darknet | Honeypots | Behavioral analysis | [15] |
| Darknet | Passive monitoring | Time-series analysis | [14] |

These studies provide valuable insights into the nature and characteristics of malicious activities but often lack a comprehensive and holistic understanding of the underlying attack strategies and intentions.

## III. Proposed Approaches, Methods, and Techniques
In this section, we detail our proposed approaches, methods, and techniques for inferring, characterizing, and clustering orchestrated and well-coordinated probing activities targeting CPS protocols.

### A. Probabilistic Model for Noise Filtering
We propose a formal preprocessing probabilistic model to filter out misconﬁguration traffic from darknet data. The model does not rely on arbitrary cut-off thresholds and provides different likelihood models to distinguish between misconﬁguration and other darknet traffic. It captures the natural behavior of misconﬁguration traffic and is independent of the nature of the traffic source.

### B. Multidimensional Investigation of Probing Activities
We infer, characterize, and investigate probing activities targeting over 20 CPS protocols. We study trends, abuse per protocol, probes' co-occurrences, source countries, and employed protocols. We also propose a hybrid approach combining temporal analysis and context-triggered piecewise hashing to detect orchestrated and well-coordinated probing activities.

There was a lack of interest in UDP-based CPS services, with a prevalence of probes towards ICCP and Modbus protocols. We found that 74% of CPS probes were persistent throughout the analyzed period, targeting prominent protocols such as DNP3 and BACnet. Additionally, we uncovered nearly 9,000 large-scale, stealthy, and previously undocumented orchestrated probing events targeting several CPS protocols.
