Abstract—Although the security of Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPS) has been recently receiving signiﬁcant attention from the
research community, undoubtedly, there still exists a substantial
lack of a comprehensive and a holistic understanding of attackers’
malicious strategies, aims and intentions. To this end,
this
paper uniquely exploits passive monitoring and analysis of a
newly deployed network telescope IP address space in a ﬁrst
attempt ever to build broad notions of real CPS maliciousness.
Speciﬁcally, we approach this problem by inferring, investigating,
characterizing and reporting large-scale probing activities that
speciﬁcally target more than 20 diverse, heavily employed CPS
protocols. To permit such analysis, we initially devise and evaluate
a novel probabilistic model that aims at ﬁltering noise that is
embedded in network telescope trafﬁc. Subsequently, we generate
amalgamated statistics,
inferences and insights characterizing
such inferred scanning activities in terms of their probe types, the
distribution of their sources and their packets’ headers, among
numerous others, in addition to examining and visualizing the
co-occurrence patterns of such events. Further, we propose and
empirically evaluate an innovative hybrid approach rooted in
time-series analysis and context triggered piecewise hashing to
infer, characterize and cluster orchestrated and well-coordinated
probing activities targeting CPS protocols, which are generated
from Internet-scale unsolicited sources.
Our analysis and evaluations, which draw upon extensive network
telescope data observed over a recent one month period, demon-
strate a staggering 33 thousand probes towards ample of CPS
protocols, the lack of interest in UDP-based CPS services, and the
prevalence of probes towards the ICCP and Modbus protocols.
Additionally, we infer a considerable 74% of CPS probes that
were persistent throughout the entire analyzed period targeting
prominent protocols such as DNP3 and BACnet. Further, we
uncover close to 9 thousand large-scale, stealthy, previously
undocumented orchestrated probing events targeting a number
of such CPS protocols. We validate the various outcomes through
cross-validations against publicly available threat repositories. We
concur that the devised approaches, techniques, and methods
provide a solid ﬁrst step towards better comprehending real CPS
unsolicited objectives and intents.

INTRODUCTION
Critical
including, but not
tightly coupled systems that exhibit
infrastructure systems are indispensable to the
broader health, safety, security, and economic well-being of
modern society and governments. In recent years, many of
these systems have been undergoing large-scale transforma-
tions with the infusion of new “smart” cyber-based tech-
nologies to improve their efﬁciency and reliability. These
transitions are being driven by continual advances and cost-
efﬁciencies in areas such as integrated networking, informa-
tion processing, sensing, and actuation. Hence increasingly,
physical infrastructure devices and systems are being tasked to
co-exist and seamlessly operate in cyber-based environments.
Indeed,
this level of
integrated intelligence are often referred to as Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPS) [1].
Nowadays, CPS can be found in signiﬁcantly diverse indus-
tries,
limited to, aerospace, automotive,
energy, healthcare and manufacturing. Undeniably,
the de-
velopment and adoption of such CPS will generate unique
opportunities for economic growth and improvement of quality
of life [2]. For instance, in the transportation sector, CPS
would be rendered by interactive trafﬁc control systems that
aim at creating the notion of zero-fatality highways through
automated accident prevention and congestion reduction [3].
Further, in the healthcare sector, CPS would be perceived by
wearable and implantable sensors for cost-effective healthcare
as well as timely disease diagnosis and prevention [4]. While
CPS endeavor great opportunities, the complexity which arises
from the fusion of computational systems with physical pro-
cesses indeed hinders their utmost embracing [5]. Particularly,
within the context of security, these integrated systems yield
substantial challenges as new vulnerabilities manifest them-
selves, leading to attack models that are fundamentally new,
and predominantly hard to infer, characterize, attribute, and
analyze [6]. In turn, these gaps pose immense risks to the
physical integrity and operation of critical infrastructures.
Indeed, historical events conﬁrm that industrial control systems
have long been the target of disruptive cyber attacks. A few
examples include the exploitation of a security ﬂow in the
control system of Diesel Generators at Idaho National Labo-
ratories [7] and the prominent Stuxnet malware, which targeted
a critical uranium enriching facility, triggering immense plant
damage and even endangering human life [8]. Moreover, in
March 2016, the U.S. Industrial Control Systems-Computer
Emergency Response Team discovered an ongoing malware-
orchestrated campaign targeting critical
infrastructure. The
same campaign was inferred to be responsible for the massive
power outage that struck Ukraine in December 2015 [9]. In
the same context, given the rapid transformation of industrial
control systems towards CPS-based setups, attacks are indeed
anticipated to increase in frequency, sophistication and target
diversity. In fact, the latter trend was even recently conﬁrmed
by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as
they reported thousands of highly-tailored and speciﬁcally
engineered CPS attacks targeting diverse sectors [10].
While a plethora of research efforts, from both, the control and
cyber perspectives have been dedicated to tackling the security
of CPS (please refer to Section II), there still exists a signiﬁcant
gap, which is rendered by the lack of properly comprehending
and accurately characterizing malicious attackers’ capabilities,
intents and aims, when targeting such systems. This is largely
due to the lack of real malicious empirical data that can be
captured, inferred, and analyzed from within the boundaries
of operational CPS realms [11, 12]. Thus, without having
access to such critical information, it is practically infeasible to
elaborate effective security approaches which aim at inferring,
attributing or mitigating tangible CPS attacks. Indeed, the goal
which endeavors to capture notions of “true maliciousness” in
the context of CPS is signiﬁcantly challenging, due to many
factors, including, (1) the lack of complete maturity and the
scarcity of elaborative technical details related to CPS [13], (2)
the signiﬁcant diversity of such types of systems which exist
in numerous sectors, and (3) logistic and privacy constraints
which are often strictly enforced by CPS owners and operators.
Therefore, it is evident that auxiliary cyber threat intelligence
approaches are required in order to contribute to better grasp-
ing the notions of CPS maliciousness. While instrumenting
malicious payloads inferred from CPS vulnerabilities [14] and
concepts related to CPS honeypots have emerged and have
been investigated [15], this paper takes a complementary yet
a unique step towards this goal. To this end, we offer a ﬁrst
comprehensive analysis of probing activities that speciﬁcally
target ample of CPS communication and control protocols
by exclusively monitoring and characterizing network trafﬁc
targeting a newly deployed network telescope IP address space
(i.e., unsolicited Internet trafﬁc targeting routable, allocated yet
unused Internet Protocol (IP) addresses) [16]. In this context,
we study various dimensions related to such misdemeanors
and examine the occurrence and orchestration patterns of such
abused services. Indeed,
the presented work is innovative
and transformative in its capacity to design, implement and
evaluate automated approaches that aim at disclosing real CPS
attackers’ strategies, by passively inferring, characterizing, and
correlating CPS probing events. In summary, we frame the
paper’s contributions in the following three threads:
• Proposing a formal preprocessing probabilistic model that
aims at ﬁltering noise (i.e., misconﬁguration trafﬁc) that is
embedded in darknet data to prepare it for effective use. The
model is advantageous as it does not rely on arbitrary cut-off
thresholds, provides different likelihood models to distinguish
between misconﬁguration and other darknet trafﬁc, and is in-
dependent from the nature of the source of the trafﬁc. Further,
the proposed model neatly captures the natural behavior of
misconﬁguration trafﬁc as it targets the darknet. To the best
of our knowledge, the presented model presents a ﬁrst attempt
ever to systematically ﬁngerprint and thus ﬁlter-out darknet
misconﬁguration trafﬁc.
• Inferring, characterizing and executing multidimensional
investigation of probing activities targeting more than 20 CPS
protocols by passively monitoring 7 /24 network telescope
spaces. To this end, we study their overall
trends, abuse
per protocol, probes’ co-occurrences, source countries and
employed protocols, among various others. Additionally, we
propose an innovative hybrid approach rooted in temporal
analysis and context triggered piecewise hashing to infer, char-
acterize and report on previously undocumented orchestrated
and well-coordinated probing activities targeting a number of
CPS protocols.
• Validating the proposed models, methods and approaches
by experimenting with 50 GB of darknet data, in addition
to relying on corroborations against publicly available threat
repositories.
The road-map of this paper is organized as follows. In the
next section, we discuss related works in terms of CPS security
approaches, probing analysis and trafﬁc measurements. In
Section III, we elaborate on our proposed approaches, methods
and techniques. The corresponding evaluations,
inferences
and validations are presented in Section IV. We provide a
discussion in Section V, while Section VI summarizes this
paper and pinpoints an area that paves the way for future work.
II. RELATED WORK
In this section, we review the literature by providing two
distinct taxonomies in the context of CPS security approaches
from both, the physical/control perspective as well as from
the cyber security perspective. We further extend this section
by elaborating on probing analysis and trafﬁc measurement
studies. The aim is to shed the light on the state-of-the-art of
those research areas, in addition to pinpointing various research
gaps, which this paper intends to address and/or examine to
pave the way for future work.
A. CPS Security: Control-theoretic Approaches
The analysis of CPS security from a control-theoretic
perspective has undoubtedly received considerable attention.
Table I provides a brief taxonomy, due to space limitations,
highlighting some fundamental and representative works in
this area. In a nutshell, this taxonomy captures the modeled
systems, whether or not noise has been considered in the
approach, the analyzed attack model and its corresponding
detection scheme. Such research works consider the system
dynamics from a physical point of view to perform their
analysis. For instance, in the power grid context, Liu et al. [17]
investigated false data injection attacks by inserting arbitrary
errors into sensor measurements. The authors analyzed two
attack scenarios, where the attacker is either constrained to
some speciﬁc meters, or limited in the resources required to
compromise meters. For each scenario, algebraic conditions
are derived to validate the existence of stealthy attack vectors,
which do not yield any change to the residue. In an alternative
work, Pasqualetti et al. [19] analyzed attacks on sensors and
actuators by considering a generic continuous-time control
system. In particular, the authors mathematically characterized
certain conditions that provided the probability of detecting
such attacks, given a set of known vulnerabilities. The authors
further introduced the notion of attack detectability by design-
ing centralized and distributed ﬁlters rooted in arithmetic logic
of descriptor systems. In the area of distributed control systems
security, Pajic et al. [21] analyzed the impact of malicious
nodes in the context of a wireless control network. The

TABLE I: A brief taxonomy of CPS security approaches from a control-theoretic perspective
authors designed and assessed the effectiveness of a detector
based on an approach that aims at estimating sensor outputs.
Alternatively, Mo et al. [23] considered a data injection attack
on a noisy wireless sensor network. The attack was modeled
as a constrained optimal control problem in which the Kalman
ﬁlter was used to perform state estimation, while a failure
detector was leveraged to detect anomalies in the system. In
addition to the above, Teixeira et al. [24] have introduced and
modeled a combination of different attack scenarios such as
false data injections, replay, and zero-dynamics’ attacks, where
adversarial activities attempt to cause damage to the controlled
system while remaining stealthy. To this end, active detection
methods have been proposed to infer related attacks through
analyzing and manipulating the system dynamics. A few of
those methods, include, a physical watermarking scheme to
authenticate the nominal behavior of a control system [25]
and a moving target approach [26] to detect integrity attacks.
Indeed, the rationale behind the aforementioned substantial
control-theoretic CPS security contributions is based upon
existing models that precisely describe the underlying physical
phenomena, which enables the prediction of future behavior
and, more importantly, unforeseen deviations from it. To this
end, we argue that such approaches (1) do not provide any
concrete evidence that such deviations are in fact originated
from malicious entities, (2) depict attackers’ models in a
highly-theoretic manner, which do not necessarily reﬂect the
behavior of real CPS attacks and (3) provide experimentation
and evaluations that were executed in emulated or simulated
CPS environments, without much endeavors being dedicated
to real-world applications.
