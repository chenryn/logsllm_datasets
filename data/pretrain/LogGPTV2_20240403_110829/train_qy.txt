getprotoent_r.3
     mtk
        documents getprotoent_r(), getprotobyname_r(), and
        getprotobynumber_r(), the reentrant equivalents of
        getprotoent(), getprotobyname(), and getprotobynumber().
getrpcent_r.3
     mtk
        documents getrpcent_r(), getrpcbyname_r(), and
        getrpcbynumber_r(), the reentrant equivalents of
        getrpcent(), getrpcbyname(), and getrpcbynumber().
getservent_r.3
     mtk
        documents getservent_r(), getservbyname_r(), and
        getservbyport_r(), the reentrant equivalents of
        getservent(), getservbyname(), and getservbyport().
numa.7
    mtk
        a new page giving overview details for the linux numa interfaces.
        incorporates some material from mbind.2, and the description
        of /proc/pid/numa_maps from proc.5.
newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------
crypt.3
    mtk
        add description of crypt_r().
new and changed links
---------------------
crypt.3
    mtk
        new link to crypt.3.
getnetbyname_r.3
getnetbyaddr_r.3
    mtk
        new links to new getnetent_r.3.
getprotobyname_r.3
getprotobynumber_r.3
    mtk
        new links to new getprotoent_r.3.
getrpcbyname_r.3
getrpcbynumber_r.3
    mtk
        new links to new getrpcent_r.3.
getservbyname_r.3
getservbyport_r.3
    mtk
        new links to new getservent_r.3.
numa_maps.5
    mtk
        link to new numa(7) page, which incorporates the
        /proc/pid/numa_maps description.
        as part of the numactl() package, the /proc/pid/numa_maps
        documentation was in a numa_maps.5 page; this link
        ensures that "man 5 numa_maps" still works.
        (eventually, we may want to remove this link.)

get_mempolicy.2
mbind.2
move_pages.2
set_mempolicy.2
    mtk

changes to individual pages
---------------------------
eventfd.2
    vijay kumar
        when an eventfd overflows, select() indicates the file as both
        readable and writable (not as having an exceptional condition).
fcntl.2
    mtk
        f_dupfd_cloexec is specified in posix.1-2008.
getrlimit.2
    mtk
        notes: add text mentioning the shell 'ulimit' (or 'limit')
        built-in command for setting resource limits.
gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        conforming to: posix.1-2008 marks gettimeofday() as obsolete.
link.2
    mtk
        note kernel version where linux stopped following symbolic
        links in 'oldpath'; see also http://lwn.net/articles/294667.
        posix.1-2008 makes it implementation-dependent whether or not
        'oldpath' is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.
        add a reference to linkat(2) for an interface that allows
        precise control of the treatment of symbolic links.
mbind.2
    mtk
        remove material on library support and numactl; that material
        is now in numactl.7.
mmap.2
    mtk
        add kernel version numbers for map_32bit.
        add some details on map_32bit (see http://lwn.net/articles/294642).
move_pages.2
    mtk
        added versions (from kernel 2.6.18) and conforming to sections.
open.2
    mtk
        o_cloexec is specified in posix.1-2008.
socket.2
    mtk
        s/d/domain/ for name of argument.
        add reference to socket(2) for further information on
        domain, type, and protocol arguments.
utimensat.2
    mtk
        conforming to: posix.1-2008 specifies utimensat() and futimens().
dirfd.3
    mtk
        conforming to: add posix.1-2008; other minor changes.
exec.3
    mtk
        small rewording: "s/returned/failed with/ [an error]".
fmemopen.3
    mtk
        since glibc 2.7, it is possible to seek past the end of
        a stream created by open_memstream().  add a bugs section
        describing the bug in earlier glibc versions.
gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        clarify exactly which functions are obsoleted by getnameinfo()
        and getaddrinfo().
getnetent.3
    mtk
        rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        the database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/null-terminated list/
    mtk
        in glibc 2.2, the type of the 'net' argument for getnetbyaddr()
        changed from 'long' to 'uint32_t'.
    mtk
        note that the gethostbyaddr() 'net' argument is in host byte order.
    mtk
        return value: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        see also: add getnetent_r.3.
getprotoent.3
    mtk
        rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        the database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/null-terminated list/
    mtk
        return value: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        see also: add getprotoent_r.3.
getrpcent.3
    mtk
        s/rpc/rpc/.
        rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        s/zero terminated list/null-terminated list/
    mtk
        return value: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        see also: add getrpcent_r.3.
getservent.3
    mtk
        rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        the database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/null-terminated list/
    mtk
        return value: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        see also: add getservent_r.3.
mkdtemp.3
    mtk
        conforming to: this function is specified in posix.1-2008.
mq_notify.3
    venkatesh srinivas
        s/sigev_notify_function/sigev_thread_function/
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=494956.
realpath.3
    mtk
        relocate text for resolved_path==null case to description.
        posix.1-2001 leaves the resolved_path==null case as
        implementation-defined; posix.1-2008 specifies the behavior
        described in this man page.
sem_init.3
    mtk
        posix.1-2008 rectifies the posix.1-2001 omission, specifying
        that zero is returned by a successful sem_init() call.
core.5
    mike bianchi / mtk
        make the page more helpful to non-programmers by referencing
        the documentation of the shell's 'ulimit' command in the
        discussion of rlimit_core and rlimit_fsize.
        see also: add bash(1).
    mtk
        note that a core dump file can be used in a debugger.
proc.5
    mtk
        remove /proc/pid/numa_maps material (it is now in numa(7)).
cpuset.7
    mtk
        see also: add numa(7).
inotify.7
    mtk / li zefan
         explain bug that occurred in coalescing identical events in
         kernels before 2.6.25.
         (see commit 1c17d18e3775485bf1e0ce79575eb637a94494a2
         "a potential bug in inotify_user.c" in the 2.6.25 changelog.)
pthreads.7
    mtk
        update thread-safe functions list with changes in posix.1-2008.
        see also: add proc(5).
signal.7
    mtk
        update list of async-signal-safe functions for posix.1-2008.

changes to individual pages
---------------------------
fcntl.2
    mtk, after a note by mike bianchi
        more clearly and consistently describe whether
        or not the third argument to fcntl() is required,
        and what its type should be.
    mtk
        move description of negative l_len  from notes, integrating
        it into the discussion of file locking.
        minor rewrites of the text on file locking.
getrusage.2
    bernd eckenfels
        see also: add clock(3), clock_gettime(3).
        see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475
ioctl_list.2
    mtk
        remove old sentence about where to send updates for this page.
        add more detail on mount options that prevent updates to atime.
sched_setscheduler.2
    carsten emde
        update kernel version numbers relating to real-time support.
stat.2
    h. peter anvin
        note that lstat() will generally not trigger automounter
        action, whereas stat() will.
clock.3
    bernd eckenfels
        see also: add clock_gettime(3).
        see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475
clock_getres.3
    tolga dalman / mtk
        add "link with -lrt" to synopsis; remove now redundant
        sentence mentioning librt from notes.
getdate.3
    mtk
        rewrite description of getdate_r() and integrate into main text
        (rather than describing in notes).
        other parts rewritten for greater clarity.
        make it clearer in the main text that glibc does not implement %z;
        remove discussion of that point from notes.
        added an example program.
hsearch.3
    mtk
        noted that table size as specified by 'nel' is immutable.
        described differences between hsearch() and hsearch_r().
        added missing pieces to return value.
        added a number of new entries under errors.
        notes: added some basic advice on sizing the hash table;
        noted that when a table is destroyed, the caller is responsible
        for freeing the buffers pointed to by 'key' and 'data' fields.
        one of the bugs was fixed in glibc 2.3.
        rewrote and clarified various other pieces.
        rename arguments for reentrant functions, using same name as
        glibc headers: s/ret/retval/; s/tab/htab/.
    mtk, after a suggestion by timothy s. nelson
        integrate discussion of reentrant functions into main discussion
        (rather than as a short paragraph at the end).
iconv.3
    bruno haible
        describe "shift sequence" input.
ptsname.3
    sukadev
        fix return type of ptsname_r() in synopsis.
readdir.3
    h. peter anvin
        s/stat(2)/lstat(2)/ when discussing d_type (since we
        are talking about a case where we might be interested to
        whether the file itself is a symbolic link).
sigsetops.3
    chris head, signed-off-by: mike frysinger
        fix typo: s/sigdelset/sigorset/
proc.5
    mats wichmann / mtk
        s/\[number]/[pid]/ in file names for /proc/pid files.
        and similar changes for task/[tid] sub-directories.
    mtk / mats wichmann
        in the description if /proc/[pid]/environ, remove reference to
        lilo(8)/grub(8) since there seems to be nothing in those pages
        that related to this /proc file.
    michael schurter / mtk
        remove sentence wrongly saying that /proc/meminfo reports
        info in bytes;
        see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=462969
    mtk
        note that /proc/meminfo reports system-wide memory usage
        statistics.
    joe korty
        document new fields in /proc/interrupts that were added in
        linux 2.6.24.
unix.7
    marko kreen
        since glibc 2.8, _gnu_source must be defined in order to get
        the definition of the ucred structure from .

dirfd.3
readdir.3
rewinddir.3
scandir.3
seekdir.3
telldir.3
    mtk
        fix 'dir' argument name: should be 'dirp'.
        posix.1-2008 and glibc call this argument 'dirp' (consistent
        with the fact that it is a *pointer* to a dir structure).

clone.2
    mtk, after a comment by john reiser
        clarify text describing getpid() caching bug for clone() wrapper.
