By default, the link extractor calls canonicalize_url on the collected links.  
The following is not what browsers do:
    canonicalize_url('http://example.com/index.php?/a/=/o/')
    'http://example.com/index.php?%2Fa%2F=%2Fo%2F'  # encoding forward slashes
    canonicalize_url('http://example.com/index.php?a')
    'http://example.com/index.php?a='  # appending = on empty arguments
I doubt this is a problem in canonicalize_url  
because it's not meant to mimic browsers in the first place, is it?
However this is a problem for the link extractor  
because it can potentially end up extracting urls  
that are wrong from the server's perspective.  
In this example, the server doesn't recognise the extractor's url, only the
browser's:
    # http://forum.laptop.bg/index.php?/discover/
    LinkExtractor(restrict_xpaths=('//a[contains(@href, "/topic")]',)).extract_links(response)[0].url
    # Extractor: http://forum.laptop.bg/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F57339-%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF-asus-w90vp%2F=&comment=221153&do=findComment

Was this a design decision or a bug?
