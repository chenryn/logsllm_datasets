I have two projects and each of them has
https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/requirejs/require.d.ts
file included. While compiling them with TS 1.4 I got 55 errors of "Duplicate
identifier '[member_name]'".  
How I can eliminate this issue or at least switch it to a warning? Hope it is
not by design.
