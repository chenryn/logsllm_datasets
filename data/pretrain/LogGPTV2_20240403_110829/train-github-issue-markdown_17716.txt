I have two projects, and both include the following file:
```
https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/requirejs/require.d.ts
```

When I compile these projects using TypeScript 1.4, I encounter 55 errors stating "Duplicate identifier '[member_name]'."

How can I resolve this issue, or at least change the error to a warning? I hope this is not by design.
