Question: "A mobile app security tester is examining an iOS application that claims to protect user privacy while accessing protected resources. The tester notes that the app includes 'UIBackgroundModes' with 'bluetooth-peripheral' and 'bluetooth-central' in the 'Info.plist' file. Why might the tester still be concerned about the app's access to Bluetooth peripherals?"
 "A": "The 'UIBackgroundModes' values alone do not prompt the user for permission to access Bluetooth peripherals."
 "B": "The app may crash on devices that do not support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) due to the 'UIBackgroundModes' configuration."
 "C": "Including 'bluetooth-peripheral' and 'bluetooth-central' in 'UIBackgroundModes' overrides the need for 'UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities'."
 "D": "The 'UIBackgroundModes' settings are likely to be ignored by the system since they are not part of 'UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities'."
Answer: A
