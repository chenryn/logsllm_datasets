### Issue Description
When attempting to compile a React 15 project using TypeScript and Material-UI 1.0.0-beta, TypeScript encounters inconsistencies in the type definitions.

### Expected Behavior
The project should compile successfully with Material-UI, React 15, and TypeScript working together without any issues.

### Current Behavior
TypeScript is unable to compile the project due to several typing and descriptor inconsistencies. According to the package descriptor, Material-UI should be compatible with both React 15 and React 16. However, some of the type definitions, such as those for the `Table` component, seem to rely on React 16 definitions, which causes compatibility issues with React 15.

#### Example Errors:
1. **Tooltip Component:**
   ```
   .../material-ui/Tooltip/Tooltip.d.ts (4,18): error TS2430: Interface 'TooltipProps' incorrectly extends interface 'HTMLAttributes'.
   Types of property 'label' are incompatible. Type 'ReactNode' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'. Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'.
   ```

2. **TableCell Component:**
   ```
   .../material-ui/Table/TableCell.d.ts (17,11): error TS2694: Namespace 'React' has no exported member 'ThHTMLAttributes'.
   ```

3. **Table Component:**
   ```
   .../material-ui/Table/Table.d.ts (5,17): error TS2694: Namespace 'React' has no exported member 'TableHTMLAttributes'.
   ```

4. **SnackbarContent Component:**
   ```
   .../material-ui/Snackbar/SnackbarContent.d.ts (5,18): error TS2430: Interface 'SnackbarContentProps' incorrectly extends interface 'PaperProps'.
   Types of property 'action' are incompatible. Type 'ReactElement | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'. Type 'ReactElement' is not assignable to type 'string | undefined'. Type 'ReactElement' is not assignable to type 'string'.
   ```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a new React app with TypeScript support:
   ```sh
   create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
   ```
2. Add Material-UI to the project:
   ```sh
   npm install @material-ui/core@1.0.0-beta10
   ```
3. Add a component that uses Material-UI and try to compile the project.

### Context
The project fails to build due to the type definition issues described above.

### Environment
- Material-UI: 1.0.0-beta10
- React: 15.3.0
- TypeScript: 2.3.4

### Additional Notes
I have searched the repository's issues and believe this is not a duplicate.
