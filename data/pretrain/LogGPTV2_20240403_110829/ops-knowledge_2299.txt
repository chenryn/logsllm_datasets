User: I'm working by myself right now, but am looking at ways to scale my operation. 
I'd like to find an easy way to version my Python distribution, so that I can recreate it very easily. Is there a tool to do this? Or can I add /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ (or whatever) to an svn repo? This doesn't solve the problems with PATHs, but I can always write a script to alter the path. Ideally, the solution would be to build my Python env in a VM, and then hand copies of the VM out.
How have other people solved this?
Assistant: You want to use virtualenv.  It lets you create an application(s) specific directory for installed packages.  You can also use pip to generate and build a requirements.txt
