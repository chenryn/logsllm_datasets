Think this feature would be very useful
    julia> type Foo
                bar
                baz::Int
                qux::Float64
            end
    julia> foo = Foo("Hello, world.", 23, 1.5)
    Foo("Hello, world.",23,1.5)
    julia> foo.
    bar    baz    qux
press `tab` after name and dot, show its fields only.
Would this be hard to implement ? I have no idea how auto-complete is
implemented.
