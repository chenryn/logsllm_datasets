To set a default host for your Nginx installation, you need to ensure that the configuration is correctly structured. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

### 1. Understanding Nginx Configuration Structure
Nginx configurations are based on nested blocks. There should only be one `http` block, which is typically defined in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. All other included files (e.g., from `sites-available`) are included within this `http` block.

### 2. Setting Up a Default/Catch-All Host
To set up a default or catch-all host, you need to define a `server` block with the `listen` directive and a `default_server` parameter. This ensures that any requests not matching other server names will be handled by this default server.

Here is an example of how to set up a default host:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    server_name _;  # A non-matching name

    # Your default server configuration here
    root /var/www/default;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    # Logging (optional)
    access_log /var/log/nginx/default.access.log main;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/default.error.log;
}
```

### 3. Resolving Configuration Errors
Based on the errors you encountered:

- **Error 1: Unknown directive "http"**
  - Ensure that the `http` block is only defined once in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. Do not include another `http` block in your `catchall` file.

- **Error 2: Unknown log format "main"**
  - Make sure that the `log_format` named `main` is defined in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. It should look something like this:
    ```nginx
    http {
        log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                        '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                        '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

        # Other http block configurations
    }
    ```

### 4. Testing and Restarting Nginx
After making these changes, test your Nginx configuration to ensure there are no syntax errors:

```sh
sudo nginx -t
```

If the test is successful, restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```sh
sudo service nginx restart
```

### 5. Additional Notes
- If you omit the `default_server` parameter, the first `server` block in the configuration will be treated as the default.
- For more detailed information, refer to the [Nginx documentation on server names](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html).

By following these steps, you should be able to set up a default host for your Nginx installation and resolve the configuration errors you encountered.
