Number of power-off or emergency retract cycles.
The count of errors that could not be recovered using hardware ECC.
The total count of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector. A rise in
the value of this attribute indicates defects of the disk surface and/or problems
in the mechanical subsystem.
Count of ”unstable” sectors (waiting to be remapped, because of unrecoverable
read errors).
Count of reallocated sectors. The raw value represents a count of the bad
sectors that have been found and remapped. This value is primarily used as a
metric of the life expectancy of the drive.

anomaly detection. Algorithms that detect frequent episodes
in event sequences can be found in [20], [25]. Hubballi et.
al. [16] leverage the concept of n-gram in natural language
processing to model patterns in system calls, by constructing
n-gram trees for short sequences of system calls. The above
works share similarities with our method in terms of utilizing
a sliding window to cut the discrete events into many sub-
sequences. However, these works apply on event sequences of
high cardinality while here we are restricted by the fact that
all sequences are of low cardinality.
There are also works that focus on anomaly detection in
a single discrete categorical event sequence [26]. Dong et.
al. propose an efﬁcient method for mining emerging patterns
in a categorical data sequence for trend discovery [12]. A
method based on MaxCut is proposed to detect anomalous
events in activity networks [34]. Another anomaly detection
technique that focuses on categorical datasets [11] uses a
local anomaly detector to identify individual records with
anomalous attribute values and then detects patterns where
the number of anomalous records is higher than expected.
The above techniques are applied to a single discrete event
sequence without considering the time aspect of events or
without considering any inter-dependence relationship among
different sources of events or variables. Therefore, these al-
gorithms cannot discover component-wise knowledge on the
underlying system or offer anomaly detection based on system-
wide understanding and modeling. Multidimensional Hawkes
processes [22] and its variants [13], [27] have been applied
to model the inter-dependent relationship across multi-source
events. Hawkes processes are based on point processes that
model the conditions that affect the intensity of arrival events
with changing intervals.
The proposed methodology in this paper is a generic un-
supervised learning framework for discrete event sequences
collected from sensors. By leveraging language translation, we
successfully quantify pairwise relationships among sensors,
which in turn are used to build a multivariate relationship
graph. This graph is able to provide valued system information
for knowledge discovery and anomaly detection.
VI. CONCLUSION
Modern physical systems deploy large numbers of sensors
to record the system status of different components. Although
a signiﬁcant portion of those sensors report discrete event
sequences, there is a lack of effective methodologies that are
designed especially for such data. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised learning analytics framework specially designed
for discrete event sequences collected from sensors in real-
world systems for knowledge discovery, anomaly detection,
and fault diagnosis. It
leverages the concept of language
translation by considering the discrete event sequences of
sensors as their languages and then apply NMT models to
translate the language of one sensor to another. Naturally, the
translation score turns to be an effective metric to quantify
the pairwise relationships among discrete event sequences of
sensors, which are difﬁcult
to learn by most state-of-the-
art algorithms that mainly work for continuous time series.
With sensor pairwise relationships, the analytics framework
builds a multivariate relationship graph to represent system
information. The proposed framework is validated on two real-
world datasets: a proprietary dataset from a physical plant and
a public hard disk drive dataset from Backblaze, and is shown
to be effective in extracting sensor pairwise relationships for
knowledge discovery, anomaly detection, and fault diagnosis.
