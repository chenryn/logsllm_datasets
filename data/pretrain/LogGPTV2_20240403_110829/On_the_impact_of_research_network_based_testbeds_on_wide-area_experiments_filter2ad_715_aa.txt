ABSTRACT
An important stage of wide-area systems and networking
research is to prototype a system to understand its per-
formance when deployed in the real Internet. A key re-
quirement of prototyping is that results obtained from the
prototype experiments be representative of the behavior if
the system were deployed over nodes connected to commer-
cial ISPs. Recently, distributed testbeds such as PlanetLab
and RON have become increasingly popular for performing
wide-area experimentation. However, such testbeds typi-
cally consist of a signiﬁcant fraction of nodes with connec-
tivity to research and education networks which potentially
hinder their usability in prototyping systems.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of testbeds with
connectivity to research and education networks on the ap-
plications and network services so that such testbeds can
be leveraged for evaluation and prototyping. Speciﬁcally,
we investigate when the representativeness of wide-area ex-
periments deployed on such testbeds is aﬀected by studying
the routing paths that applications use over such testbeds.
We then investigate how the representativeness of wide-area
experiments is aﬀected by studying the performance prop-
erties of such paths. We further measure the impact of us-
ing such testbeds on application performance via application
case studies. Finally, we propose a technique that uses the
currently available testbeds but reduces their bias by ex-
posing applications evaluated to network conditions more
reﬂective of the conditions in the commercial Internet.

INTRODUCTION
The tremendous growth in the Internet has also seen a
signiﬁcant increase in research based on wide-area networks.
A large body of work has concentrated on developing new
distributed systems and network services for the wide area.
For example, distributed systems such as DHTs (e.g., [20]),
application-layer multicast (e.g., [9]), distributed storage (e.g.,
[21]), search (e.g., [29]), and ﬁle sharing (e.g., [35]) have been
developed. Similarly, new network services to improve reli-
ability (e.g., SOSR [7]), throughput (RON [1]), DNS perfor-
mance (e.g., CoDNS [13]), web performance (e.g., CoDeeN
[26]), and QoS (OverQoS [25]) have also been developed.
An important stage of all the above research is to pro-
totype the distributed system and evaluate its behavior us-
ing relevant metrics in an Internet testbed. The speciﬁc
metrics that are appropriate depend on the system under
evaluation. A key requirement of prototyping is that re-
sults obtained from the prototype experiments should be
representative1 of the behavior if the system were deployed
over nodes connected to commercial ISPs. This is desirable
because: (1) More than 93% of all the ASes in the Inter-
net belong to the commercial Internet and thus applications
and network services should be evaluated under conditions
prevalent in the commercial Internet. (2) The commercial
Internet represents a much wider user-base and thus most
distributed applications and network services are envisioned
to be deployed primarily in the commercial Internet. Note
that while there are applications intended for deployment in
research networks (e.g., high performance grid computing),
we are considering here research on general network services
and applications intended to be deployed in the commercial
Internet.
Ideally, more representative results can be achieved by
evaluating the system using a wide-area distributed testbed
whose nodes reside in the commercial Internet. The reality,
on the other hand, is that obtaining any testbed of nodes
can be a signiﬁcant hurdle. Initially, researchers contacted
friends and colleagues in other universities for access to ma-
chines to evaluate their systems (e.g., ESM [9]). Fortunately,
the last few years have seen the development of shared wide-
area testbeds such as RON [1, 19] and PlanetLab [15, 16]
that facilitate wide-area experimentation. These testbeds
1The term representative is used loosely to denote similarity.
provide a distributed platform with nodes at several ge-
ographically distributed locations. Researchers use these
testbed nodes as vantage points for measurements, as nodes
that host their distributed system, or as end-hosts of an
overlay network.
Although such testbeds are very popular and highly use-
ful in the initial deployment and debugging of a system, the
prototype performance/measurement results obtained from
such a testbed will be more representative if the testbeds
have nodes with commercial network connectivity. How-
ever, the common case for such testbeds is that a signiﬁ-
cant percentage of nodes have connectivity to the research
and education networks. For example, when testbeds are
formed by contacting colleagues [9], these colleagues are
fellow researchers, typically working in a university envi-
ronment. Such nodes belonging to educational institutions
are usually connected to research and education networks.
Similarly, 85% of nodes (typically hosted at educational in-
stitutions) in the popular PlanetLab testbed and 50% of
nodes in the RON testbed have connectivity to the research
and education networks. Thus, the connectivity of the cur-
rently available testbeds is not entirely commercial in na-
ture, i.e., they are “mixed” testbeds containing a mixture
of nodes with commercial and non-commercial connectivity.
This hampers the representativeness of results obtained on
the testbed if such testbeds are used for prototyping since
non-commercial ASes (around 1400 in number) are a small
fraction (less than 7%) of all ASes on the Internet.
Thus, in order to leverage these existing and available
testbeds for prototyping distributed systems, it is essential
to study the impact of such mixed testbeds on the repre-
sentativeness of application performance. Such a study is
signiﬁcant since it enables system researchers to identify the
limitations of these testbeds and hence leverage them suit-
ably for their research. This paper, thus, focuses on the
impact of mixed testbeds on the applications and network
services being evaluated and prototyped over that testbed.
Speciﬁcally, we investigate when the representativeness of
wide-area experiments deployed on a mixed testbed is af-
fected by studying the routing paths that applications use
over such testbeds. We then investigate how the represen-
tativeness of wide-area experiments is aﬀected by studying
the performance properties of the non-representative paths.
We further measure the impact of using such mixed testbeds
on metrics used in distributed systems. Finally, we propose
a simple technique that uses the currently available mixed
testbeds but reduces their bias so that applications being
evaluated are exposed to network conditions more reﬂective
of the conditions when the applications are deployed in the
commercial Internet. Another contribution of our work is
a methodology to compare and calibrate various network
performance metrics using mixed testbeds compared with
commercial testbeds which can also be used to validate fu-
ture testbeds for evaluating applications.
Our key ﬁndings are that:
• Current wide-area testbeds have a large fraction of
nodes worldwide that use paths through research and
education networks to communicate with each other,
completely bypassing the commercial Internet.
• We ﬁnd that the performance properties of these re-
search and education networks are signiﬁcantly diﬀer-
ent from the commercial Internet and this hampers the
representativeness of network conditions experienced
by applications evaluated on the testbeds. This im-
pact is quantiﬁed through application case studies.
• Encouragingly, we ﬁnd that the nodes with research
and education connectivity can still be leveraged for
experimentation since paths from these nodes to the
nodes with commercial connectivity traverse a large
fraction in commercial networks and were found to
have similar distributions of performance properties.
• A simple overlay routing based solution can be use-
ful to expose applications to network conditions more
representative of the commercial Internet.
We note that this paper is not intended as a criticism
of current testbeds such as PlanetLab and RON. In fact,
we believe that these testbeds provide a valuable and highly
useful service to the research community. Instead, our intent
is to understand how best to leverage the existing testbed re-
sources to perform representative wide-area experiments by
assessing what aspects of an application’s performance are
aﬀected by the testbed connectivity. Such an assessment has
important implications since the testbed connectivity can af-
fect the perceived performance of a wide range of distributed
systems and networking experiments. Finally, while there is
expected to be signiﬁcant diversity due to diﬀerent network
tiers and a wide range of performance properties within com-
mercial networks, this paper’s focus is to study the coarse-
grained distinction between commercial and GREN connec-
tivity and not to explore the diversity within the commercial
networks.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
discusses related work and Section 3 frames the problem by
identifying the paths that application traﬃc can take in the
current mixed testbeds. Section 4 studies the impact of us-
ing mixed testbeds on the topological properties of the rout-
ing paths taken by application traﬃc. Section 5 studies the
impact of using a mixed testbed on the performance proper-
ties of the routing paths, and Section 6 further measures the
impact on the performance of a set of applications. Finally,
Section 7 advocates a technique for improving the repre-
sentativeness of evaluation results using the current mixed
testbeds and Section 8 concludes the paper.
2. RELATED WORK
Since deploying and evaluating new systems in operational
networks is diﬃcult, researchers in networks and distributed
systems typically use discrete-event simulation, emulation,
or live network experimentation on testbeds. While sim-
ulation tools provide control and repeatability, they sacri-
ﬁce realism by abstracting many real world artifacts. Thus,
many researchers currently evaluate their systems and ser-
vices using emulation (real system on a synthetic network,
e.g., EmuLab [27]) or wide-area testbed evaluation (real
systems over real networks, e.g., PlanetLab [16], RON [19]
testbeds). Newer proposals such as VINI [4] go even further
than overlay testbeds such as PlanetLab by allowing routing
protocols themselves to be modiﬁed and importing routing
events from the real Internet into experiments. While emu-
lation provides control and repeatability with more realism
than simulators, wide-area testbeds can achieve better real-
ism speciﬁcally with regard to live network conditions. This
paper focuses on improving the realism of current wide-area
overlay testbeds that are widely used by systems researchers
to evaluate new distributed systems and network services.
Our contribution is in assessing and improving the realism of
network conditions exposed by current wide-area testbeds.
The work in [3] ﬁrst studied the interdomain connectiv-
ity of the PlanetLab testbed and argued that measurement
research carried out using PlanetLab cannot automatically
be taken as representative of the global Internet, since they
reﬂect GREN characteristics rather than those of the global
Internet; the term GREN is coined to refer to all the re-
search and education networks collectively as the Global Re-
search and Education Network. While this previous work
pointed out an important fact by studying GREN-GREN
connectivity, our paper takes this topic further and studies
exactly how a “mixed” testbed impacts the distributed sys-
tems and network services evaluated over it across all traﬃc
ﬂow scenarios. Through measurement of a wide variety of
performance properties, we quantify how GREN is diﬀer-
ent from the commercial Internet and whether it impacts
applications. Finally, apart from a cautionary perspective
on the use of such mixed testbeds, we advocate a technique
to maximally leverage the testbed to provide results more
representative of the commercial Internet where many dis-
tributed systems and network services are envisioned to be
deployed.
It is well known [14] that Internet measurements heavily
depend on measurement vantage points. Related to net-
work measurements, wide-area application performance is
also strongly inﬂuenced by the topological properties of the
deployment locations.
In our work, we focus on this lat-
ter problem, acknowledging the impact of network location
on common network performance metrics such as delay and
loss behavior. However, we attempt to quantify such impact
from application’s perspective.
3. APPLICATION TRAFFIC PATHS
IN MIXED TESTBEDS
A key requirement in prototyping a distributed system
using a testbed as an experimentation platform is to obtain
performance/measurement results that are representative of
the system when deployed on nodes that are part of the
commercial service provider, i.e., the testbed nodes have
commercial connectivity. When a testbed is composed of
nodes that are connected to commercial ISPs only, the net-
work conditions applications experience is more representa-
tive of the commercial Internet. However, popular testbeds
such as PlanetLab are mixed, i.e., they have a signiﬁcant
fraction of nodes that have connectivity to research and
education networks. GREN is a global network that con-
nects various academic and research organizations by inter-
connecting many regional and national research networks.
These include high-speed research backbones such as Abi-
lene, GEANT, CANet, and regional educational networks
such as CENIC. A schematic of many major networks part
of the GREN network is shown in Figure 1. Current testbeds
typically have a signiﬁcant fraction of nodes worldwide con-
nected to these depicted research and education networks.
The currently available mixed testbeds such as Planet-
Lab have been widely used for conducting a wide variety
of distributed systems and networking projects. When such
testbeds are leveraged to prototype a distributed system,
the distributed system is typically deployed on a set of nodes

in the testbed. Typically, the application involves commu-
nication between pairs of testbed nodes. For example, an
application-layer overlay multicast will involve communica-
tion between parent and child nodes in the multicast tree.
The typical usage of the testbed can be classiﬁed accord-
ing to the type of the networks the traﬃc ﬂows in these
distributed systems traverse. Consider a testbed with N
nodes. These nodes can be divided into set C which con-
sists of nodes with only commercial Internet connectivity
and set G which consists of nodes with GREN connectivity.
Note that nodes in set G may also have commercial Internet
connectivity in addition to GREN connectivity. Consider a
pair of nodes, A (sender) and B (receiver), that are part of
the testbed and are communicating. The four traﬃc ﬂow
scenarios that can occur are:
• Case 1 - Both A and B ∈ G: This can occur for ex-
ample in the CoDeeN [26] content distribution system
on PlanetLab when a peer CDN node fetches content
from another peer.
• Case 2 - A ∈ G and B ∈ C: This can occur for example
when an intermediate node from PlanetLab (belong-
ing to G) is used to recover from path failure to a
commercial Web server in the SOSR [7] system.
• Case 3 - A ∈ C and B ∈ G: This can occur when a
commercial Web server sends fresh content to a CDN
node deployed in PlanetLab for example in the CoDeeN
[26] system.
• Case 4 - Both A and B ∈ C: This can occur for
example if both endpoints of a logical hop in a DHT
happen to be nodes with commercial connectivity in
PlanetLab [17].
Thus, distributed applications when deployed on current
testbeds such as PlanetLab and RON can potentially use
some combination of or all four traﬃc ﬂow scenarios above
during their operation. In the next sections, we study the
impact of mixed testbeds on the representativeness of appli-
cation performance by considering each of the above possible
traﬃc ﬂow scenarios.
4.
IMPACT ON TOPOLOGICAL PROPER-
TIES OF NETWORK PATHS
In this section, we identify the traﬃc scenarios when the
representativeness of applications is aﬀected by the mixed
testbed. In particular, we measure and analyze the routing
paths used by the traﬃc scenarios to identify non-representa-
tive cases.
4.1 Methodology
To characterize the behavior in each of the four traﬃc ﬂow
scenarios mentioned in the previous section, we used the
PlanetLab [15] testbed as an example of a mixed testbed
consisting of nodes with non-commercial and commercial
connectivity. The nodes in PlanetLab were divided into two
groups: (1) nodes in G which have GREN connectivity and
(2) nodes in C which have connectivity only through com-
mercial ISPs. This breakdown is performed as follows: We
obtained the origin ASN for the IP address of each Planet-
Lab node by identifying the ASN associated with the longest
matching preﬁx to the IP. A list of preﬁx to ASN mappings
was compiled by using the routing information from the
BGP tables obtained from RIPE [18] and Route-Views [12].
We also compiled a list of GREN ASes by extracting all the
routes announced by Abilene similar to in [3]. Further, to
ensure correctness and completeness, we matched the above
GREN AS list with another GREN AS list compiled by using
the source ﬁeld from a BGP RIB ﬁle in MRT format (ob-
tained from Route-Views) and selecting out the data with
source as Abilene, Indiana (ASN 11537). All nodes whose
origin ASNs are contained in the GREN list are put in G
and the remaining nodes are put in C.
We perform this study in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage,
only nodes within North America were considered. Here,
after eliminating unresponsive nodes, the group G had 76
nodes while the group C had 11 nodes. In the second stage,
we considered nodes all over the world. In this scenario, the
group G had 155 nodes while the group C had 25 nodes.
Interestingly not all nodes belonging to commercial organi-
zations (e.g., HP Labs node pli2.pa-3.hpl.hp.com) belong in
C. On the other hand not all university nodes belong to
G (e.g., IIT Bombay, India node planetlab1.iitb.ac.in) since
some do not yet have GREN connectivity. We then studied
the routes taken by the traﬃc in Cases 1, 2, 3 and 4 described
in the previous section to characterize their behavior.
To collect the routes along which traﬃc ﬂows, we use
the NANOG traceroute tool to obtain both AS-level and
hop-by-hop traceroutes between any two nodes. The AS-
level traceroute involves performing traceroute to the des-
tination and then looking up the preﬁx of each hop in an
AS-level registry. Currently, we conﬁgured the tool to use
the ris.whois.ripe.net registry. We then classify these ASes
into GREN and non-GREN ASes using the list of GREN
ASes obtained from the BGP dumps.
Once the routes are collected, we parse the results to mea-
sure the fraction of the route in GREN (fg). We measure fg
in two ﬂavors: (1) fgH - This is the ratio of the number of
hops with in GREN to the total number of hops traversed
by the traﬃc. A hop is assumed to be within GREN if both
end points of the hop belong to a GREN AS. (2) fgRT T
- This is the ratio of the RTT experienced by the traﬃc
within GREN to the total end-to-end RTT experienced by
the traﬃc. We also measure the absolute number of hops
within GREN (AH) and the absolute value of RTT within
GREN (ARTT).
4.2 Case 1: Source and Destination in GREN
In Case 1 (both A and B ∈ G), when A communicates
with B, it could either use the research backbone alone or
the commercial backbone alone (since A may have commer-
cial connectivity also) to route to B as depicted in the Fig-
ure 2(a). In the former case, the traﬃc may potentially ﬂow

entirely over GREN and thus have 100% of its route in a
research network. In addition, A may also use a combina-
tion of research and commercial networks to route to B (as
seen in Figure 2(b)). So when A communicates with B, it
traverses a fraction (fg) of its route in the research network
and the remaining fraction fc in the commercial network or
vice-versa. Note that the values of fg and fc depend on the
routing policy and are typically diﬀerent.
For Case 1, we performed traceroutes among all source
and destination pairs in set G for both North America and
World nodes. For North America, this resulted in 5700
traceroutes out of which 531 traceroutes were unsuccess-
ful while for World this resulted in 23,870 traceroutes out
of which 4234 were unsuccessful. The traceroute failures
occurred in this and other scenarios due to failure in receiv-
ing a reply from the intermediary routers. In this scenario,
both the source A and the destination B have GREN ASes
as their origin ASes. For each traceroute, we measure fgH ,
fgRT T , AH and ARTT.
The results of these measurements are shown in Figure 3.
The results indicate that with few exceptions, A and B
communicate with each other using routes that lie entirely
within GREN, since for almost all traceroutes, 100% of the
RTT lies within GREN. Importantly, this is true for both
North American and World nodes indicating that research
networks globally have such a routing policy. Interestingly,
in a few exceptional cases, paths switch back and forth
between research and commercial networks. For example,
the paths planetlab-1.eecs.cwru.edu → planetlab2.arizona-
gigapop.net, planetlab-1.eecs.cwru.edu → planetlab1.iitr.ern
et.in and planetlabone.ccs.neu.edu → planetlab2.arizona-giga
pop.net initially used a GREN network, switched to a com-
mercial network (gblx, Sprint and Level 3 respectively) and
back again to a GREN network. We veriﬁed that this was
not due to temporary failure of the GREN network.
In summary, with a few exceptions, when source and des-
tination have GREN connectivity, their communication en-
tirely traverses research and education networks.
4.3 Case 2: Source in GREN
In Case 2 (A ∈ G and B ∈ C), the source A has GREN
connectivity and the destination B has connectivity only via
a commercial ISP. So when A communicates with B, it tra-
verses a fraction (fg) of its route in the research network be-
fore reaching B via the commercial network. However, since
a GREN AS peers with other GREN ASes such as Abilene
and regional networks (for example, California regional net-
work (cenic.net), Illinois high school network (lincon.net)),
the value of fg is not apparent. The possible values for fg
are: (1) A can route within GREN until just before reaching
B’s commercial AS resulting in fg close to 100%, (2) A exits
into the commercial network right away from the source AS
and uses its commercial connectivity to reach B, thereby
causing fg = 0, or (3) A routes for a fraction of its distance
within GREN before exiting. Note that lower the value of
fg, the lesser the impact on the application performance and
