erators, in general, are not prepared for these types of
attacks. Hence, these types of attacks are not part of
the contingency list of the power grid operators. Our
ﬁrst suggestion is for the grid operators to consider the
MadIoT attacks in their contingency list and prepare for
them. Such preparations can be directly incorporated into
their already existing day-ahead planning tools to ensure
that their systems have for example enough inertia (or
spinning reserve) and the power lines have enough ex-
tra capacity to minimize the eﬀects of a potential attacks.
Although this might initially increase the grid operating
cost, by developing more eﬃcient planning tools and ap-
plying recent advances in designing virtual inertia for
power systems [32], these costs can be reduced in the fu-
ture. Thus, our suggestion for system operators is to push
for more research in that direction in order to make their
systems more robust to potential MadIoT attacks.
To minimize costs, the grid operators should also have
an accurate estimate of the total number of high wattage
IoT devices in their system and accordingly the scale of a
potential attack, without being overprotective.
Since this is a new type of attack, enabled by the ubiq-
uity of IoT devices, our last suggestion for the systems
operators is to revisit their online data and to ﬁnd secure
ways to release their data without revealing any critical
information that can be used by an adversary to improve
the eﬀectiveness of an attack.
5.2
IoT Side
The security challenges facing IoT devices are much
more diﬃcult to deal with. There are many ways an ad-
versary can access a smart appliance. An adversary can
directly get access to the device, or get access to the mo-
bile phone, tablet, or a thermostat that controls that de-
vice, or with the ubiquity of digital home assistant de-
vices such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, an ad-
versary can control smart appliances by getting access to
these devices. Any of these devices can be a breaching
point for an adversary. Hence, coherent security mea-
sures are needed to protect almost all the devices within
a home network against an adversary.
Thus, in the IoT side, more research is required to study
the vulnerability of IoT devices and networks, and to pro-
tect them against cyber attacks.
6 Related Work
The security and vulnerability of the IoT against cyber
attacks has been widely studied [21,42,45,50,53,57,63].
In a recent study of the DDoS attack by the Mirai bot-
net [12], Antonakakis et al. showed that due to poor secu-
rity measures in the IoT devices, such as easy to guess de-
fault passwords, an attacker could get access to about 600
thousand devices from cameras to DVRs and routers in a
very short period. Similar studies had previously shown
that Honeywell home controllers (including thermostats)
could easily be compromised due to a pair of bugs in their
authentication system [6]. It was also shown by Hernan-
dez et al. that the lack of proper hardware protections
in Nest thermostats allows attackers to install malicious
software on these devices [33]. The vulnerability of Ar-
duino Yun microcontrollers–used in some IoT devices–to
cyber attacks was also revealed by Pastrana et al. [47].
In an interesting recent work [64], Zhang et al. demon-
strated that home assistant devices can be controlled by
an adversary using inaudible voice commands.
In an-
other recent work [49], Ronen et al. demonstrated that the
smart lights within a city can potentially be compromised
by creating a worm that can aﬀect all the lamps using
Zigbee. The security of mobile applications that control
IoT devices has also been studied [28, 43]. In a compre-
hensive work [28], Fernandes et al. studied security of
all Samsung-owned SmartThings apps and demonstrated
that due to the security ﬂaws in these applications, they
could perform attacks like disabling vacation mode of a
smart home. Naveed et al. also demonstrated that mali-
cious apps on Android devices can freely mis-bond with
any external IoT devices and control them [43].
Power systems’ vulnerability to failures and attacks has
been widely studied in the past few years [14, 17, 18, 23,
54]. In a recent work [29], Garcia et al. introduced Har-
USENIX Association
27th USENIX Security Symposium    27
vey, malware that aﬀects power grid control systems and
can execute malicious commands. Theoretical methods
for detecting cyber attacks on power grids and recover-
ing information after such attacks have also been devel-
oped [15, 20, 37, 39, 40, 55]. However, most of the previ-
ous work has focused on the attacks that directly target the
power grid’s physical infrastructure or its control system.
The interdependency between failures in power grids
and communication networks, and their propagation has
also been recently studied [16, 38, 46], but these works
focused on attacks and failures that target both the power
grid’s and the communication network’s physical infras-
tructure at the same time.
Load altering attacks on smart meters and large cloud
servers has been ﬁrst introduced by Mohsenian et al. [41].
Their work was mostly focused on the cost of protect-
ing the grid against such attacks at loads.
In contrast,
we have analyzed the consequence of such attacks and
introduced practical ways that they can be performed.
Amini et al. [11] have also recently studied the eﬀects
of load altering attacks on the dynamics of the system
and ways to use the system’s frequency as feed-back to
improve an attack. In two very recent papers, Dvorkin
and Sang [24], and Dabrowski et al. [19] independently
revealed the possibility of exploiting compromised IoT
devices to disrupt normal operation of the power grid.
Dvorkin and Sang [24] modeled their attack as an opti-
mization problem for the attacker–with complete knowl-
edge of the grid–to cause circuit breakers to trip in the
distribution network.
In contrast, we have focused on
black-box attacks on transmission networks. Dabrowski
et al. [19] studied the eﬀect of demand increases caused
by remotely activating CPUs, GPUs, hard disks, screen
brightness, and printers on the frequency of the European
power grid. To the best of our knowledge, however, the
work presented in this paper provides the most coherent
and complete study on the eﬀects of potential attacks on
the power grid using high wattage IoT devices.
There is another line of research that focuses on pri-
vacy of the customers in the presence of smart power me-
ters which is beyond the scope of our paper [30].
7 Limitations and Future Work
In this work, we have analyzed the potential conse-
quences of the MadIoT attacks on the operation of the
power grid. However, our study has some limitations, and
by addressing them one can provide a clearer picture of
the threats facing the grid now and in the future. First, as
mentioned in Section 4, we have only used publicly avail-
able data sets that may not exactly reﬂect the characteris-
tics of all existing power grids. Therefore, the number of
bots listed in Table 2 may not be enough to cause signiﬁ-
cant damage to all power grids. More detailed analysis of
MadIoT attacks should be performed by system operators
with access to the details of their systems.
Second, in our studies, we have not fully considered
the existing control mechanisms for minimizing the sub-
sequent eﬀects of an initial failure (e.g., preventive load-
shedding mechanisms). Hence, our cascading failures
analysis may only reﬂect the worst case scenario.
Third, some of these high wattage IoT devices like air
conditioners, have very large capacitors. Hence, it takes
these devices 10 to 15 seconds to reach their maximum
capacities. Therefore, it might be challenging to cause an
abrupt increase in the demand and subsequently sudden
drop in the frequency using these devices. Nevertheless,
other smart devices like water heaters that are resistive
loads can still be used for such purposes. Moreover, other
varieties of the MadIoT attacks that do not require syn-
chronicity on the scale of seconds (e.g., line failures) can
still be performed using air conditioners.
Finally, unlike DDoS attacks, for the MadIoT attacks,
the IoT bots should all be geographically located within
boundaries of a power system. Hence, although the num-
bers of bots in Table 2 are achievable considering recent
botnet sizes (e.g., the Mirai botnet), it might be much
more challenging to reach these numbers within a tar-
geted geographical location.
8 Conclusions
We have studied the collective eﬀects of vulnerable
high wattage IoT devices and have shown that once com-
promised, an adversary can utilize these devices to per-
form attacks on the power grid. We have revealed a new
class of attacks on the power grid using an IoT botnet
called Manipulation of demand via IoT (MadIoT) attacks.
We have demonstrated via state-of-the-art simulators that
these attacks can result in local outages as well as large-
scale blackouts in the power grid depending on the scale
of the attack as well as the operational properties of the
grid. Moreover, we have shown that the MadIoT attacks
can also be used to increase the operating cost of the grid
to beneﬁt a few utilities in the electricity market.
We hope that our work raises awareness of the signiﬁ-
cance of these attacks to grid operators, smart appliance
manufacturers, and systems security experts in order to
make the power grid (and other interdependent networks)
more secure against cyber attacks. This is especially crit-
ical in the near future when more smart appliances with
the ability to connect to the Internet are going to be man-
ufactured. In particular, our work leads to following rec-
ommendations for the research community:
Power systems’ operation: Power systems’ operators
should rigorously analyze the eﬀects of potential MadIoT
attacks on their systems and develop preventive methods
to protect their systems.
Initiating a data sharing plat-
form between academia and industry may expedite these
developments in the future.

IoT security: As shown by both presented MadIoT at-
tacks and the Mirai botnet, insecure IoT devices can have
devastating consequences that go far beyond individual
security/privacy losses. This necessitates a rigorous pur-
suit of the security of IoT devices, including regulatory
frameworks.
Interdependency: Our work demonstrates that inter-
dependency between infrastructure networks may lead to
hidden vulnerabilities. System designers and security an-
alysts should explicitly study threats introduced by in-
terdependent infrastructure networks such as water, gas,
transportation, communication, power grid, and several
other networks.
