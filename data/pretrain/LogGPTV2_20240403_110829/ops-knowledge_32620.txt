User: I have on my Fedora 20 additionally to 2.7 a python3.6 version installed.
When I run a script with the 3.6 version it's missing the requests module.
When I try to install it with the pip command it says it's already there.
So, how can I install this module in python3.6?
Any hints?
Thanks
Assistant: Check if pip36 or more likely pip3 is a function you can run. Often times the pip command corresponds to the first installed python version, so if you install one later it gets the suffix according to its version. If that is the case then you'll want to do pip36 (pip3) install moduleXYZ.
