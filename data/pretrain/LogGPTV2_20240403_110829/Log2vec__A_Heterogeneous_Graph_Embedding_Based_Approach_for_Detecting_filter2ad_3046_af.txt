### Incorporating Email Communication and Online Activity Data

The analysis includes email communication patterns, web browsing behavior, and file and machine access patterns. Within a corporate setting, features also encompass login activities, printer usage, and connection data [46]. A typical approach is to transform user behavior into sequences or graphs for analysis [12, 35, 38, 40, 41, 47]. These methods construct normal behavior patterns and then compare them with new behaviors or predict new ones to identify anomalies. Log2vec, in particular, transforms relationships among log entries into a graph and uses graph embedding to detect anomalies based on various relationships among these entries.

### Provenance Tracking Systems

Provenance tracking systems are designed to monitor and analyze system activities [17, 22, 26, 30, 55]. There are two key differences between log2vec and these systems. First, most provenance tracking systems focus on attack forensics rather than cyber threat detection. Second, these systems use causal graphs to track operations and interactions at the system-call level (e.g., IPC syscalls operating on pipes and semaphores). In contrast, log2vec analyzes logs that record user behavior in information systems (e.g., connecting a removable storage device or browsing a website) and captures multiple relationships among logs that reflect typical user behavior.

### Advanced Threat Detection: HOLMES

HOLMES is an advanced method for detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) [34]. It constructs high-level scenario graphs based on information flows, reflecting only causal and sequential relationships among log entries. Consequently, its detection results, which are scored according to the severity levels of their components, may not perform satisfactorily in all scenarios.

### Graph Embedding

Graph analysis has been extensively researched and applied across various domains [8, 19, 53]. Among these methods, graph embedding has gained significant attention [44]. Recently, deep learning has been employed in graph embedding [28, 45], likely due to its superior supervised learning capabilities. For example, Xu et al. used graph embedding to compute the similarity of binary functions from different platforms [59].

Word2vec-based graph embedding is another popular method [14, 39, 42, 54]. In cybersecurity, Backes et al. utilized this method for social relation inference attacks [3]. Inspired by graph embedding and metapath [52], Dong et al. introduced a new method for processing heterogeneous graphs that previous methods could not handle [11]. Log2vec builds upon this method, making it applicable to the heterogeneous graph in this study.

### Conclusions

We propose log2vec, a heterogeneous graph embedding-based approach for cyber threat detection. To our knowledge, log2vec is the first sophisticated and effective method for constructing such graphs in this field. We have designed an improved graph embedding technique whose output is processed by a practical detection algorithm. A prototype of log2vec has been implemented, and evaluations demonstrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in log-level granularity, effectively detecting cyber threats in various scenarios.
