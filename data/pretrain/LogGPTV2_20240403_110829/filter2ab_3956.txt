titleblackhat:eu-22 The Aftermath of a Social Engineering Pentest - Are We Being Ethically Responsible?
In 2020, GoDaddy launched a phishing exercise targeting 500 employees, using a Christmas bonus as a lure. Those who failed the test were punished with an extra workload. This caught international media attention and begged the question: Is it morally sound to target people? Over the years, pentesting humans leveraging social engineering techniques have become increasingly important to many organizations, and rightfully so. While many focus on the performance of a social engineering engagement, fewer deal with the post-engagement process. How do we deal with the results of a social engineering engagement? How does a target feel afterward knowing they have been duped, and who is helping them? Taking care of those affected by social engineering engagements is pivotal in making an engagement a positive learning experience, and avoiding negative outcomes. If the post-engagement process were poor, and it turned into a blame-game, one could argue that the pentest itself was futile, as there would be no room for creating a learning environment. A social engineering pentest puts humans (and not systems as seen in technical pentests), to the test. By doing so, the people affected can feel they have failed as humans and not just failed professionally. Distress, psychological strain, and self-blame are just some of the factors that can affect a human not being treated correctly in the aftermath of a pentest. This presentation seeks to highlight the possible pitfalls in handling the aftermath of social engineering engagements and explores various challenges and proposed solutions to problems that may arise.
