User: Is there a way to override all file operations in Python? File operations such as 'open', 'os.rename' and 'os.unlink'.
I want to create a temporary, in-memory file system without rewriting a library. Does anyone know of a script or a library that has this feature? I want to run a library on Google App Engine and it is not possible to write to the file system.
Assistant: I found this which may be close enough to do the job code.google.com/p/pyfilesystem
