User: I am using py2exe to compiling python scripts in executable files on Windows Xp/7/2000.
I am wondering if such executable scripts could freeze the operating system, and I have to reboot Windows.
I suppose such problems could occur if I try to manage driver library.
What do you think about?
Assistant: Theoretically, yes. Windows is not the most stable OS out there, and programs sometime "freeze" it even without mucking with drivers and kernel-mode code. Python programs aren't any different in this respect, whether packed with py2exe or not, since Python programs on Windows easily have access to the same Windows APIs any other program can access.
However, I have a feeling you're not "just asking" if you have a specific application freezing the system, it's something that should be addressed for the specific case in hand. Unless the application does something really crazy, it's probably a bug in it that can be solved.
