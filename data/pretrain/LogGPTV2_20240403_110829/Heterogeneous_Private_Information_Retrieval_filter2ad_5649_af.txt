(e.g., 0.2s client computation time compared to 9s server
computation time in Goldberg’s). Therefore, we believe that
HPIR improves a client’s overall experience by ofﬂoading
the bulk of computations to the resourceful server, which can
reduce the client’s overall retrieving time.
C. Communication Overhead
Recall that, in HPIR the client can control the DH pa-
rameter by splitting the q + 1 query vectors non-uniformly
among the PIR servers, e.g., q and 1 vectors to the rich and
poor servers, respectively. Figure 5 shows the download and
upload bandwidth overheads of our heterogeneous protocol
for retrieving q = 31 records from a 2 GB database, with
different degrees of heterogeneity. As can be seen, increasing
the degree of heterogeneity trades off the communication

has smaller server computation overhead compared to these
two PIR designs, despite the fact that HPIR retrieves a much
larger ﬁle (i.e., 270kB versus 4B and 288B). Also, the upload
bandwidth of HPIR is better than these two designs, and its
download bandwidth is close to them despite retrieving much
larger data.
We also compare RAID-PIR [18], which is an ITPIR
algorithm, with our IT HPIR protocol. We use the original
implementation of RAID-PIR [46]. As shown in Table V, in
retrieving a ﬁle of 540 KB, the poor HPIR server achieves
lower computation and download bandwidth overheads. In-
creasing the DH metric will further reduce the load on our
poor HPIR server.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
We introduced a new class of multi-server PIR protocols,
called heterogeneous PIR (HPIR), in which the PIR servers
running the protocol undertake different computation and com-
munication overheads. We argue that HPIR algorithms enable
new applications for PIR by allowing the participation of low-
resource parties in running private services, as well as improve
the utility of some of the existing applications of PIR.
We designed the ﬁrst HPIR protocol that is based on a
novel PIR-tailored secret sharing construction, and deployed
an efﬁcient implementation of it compatible with the Percy++
PIR library [43]. We extensively evaluated the performance of
our implemented HPIR protocol in different settings, e.g., for
different degrees of heterogeneity.

We would like to thank Christina Poepper for shepherding
our paper, Adam O’Neill and Mukul Kulkarni for extremely
helpful discussions, and anonymous reviewers for their feed-
back. This research was funded by the NSF award #1719386
and the Intel Corporation award #34627511.
Figure 5: The upload and download overheads for our HPIR
(complete version). We download a 10.95MB ﬁle from a 2GB
database with q = 31.
Figure 6: The upload and download overheads (normalized
by size of the requested ﬁle) for our HPIR. We download a
10.95MB ﬁle from a 2GB database.
PIR-PSI [19] is based on the distributed point function (DPF)
rather than secret sharing; therefore there is no trivial way to
convert them into an HPIR setting.
The two-server protocol of PIR-PSI [19] and the single-
server SealPIR [4] provide computational security, so we
compare them with our computational HPIR protocol (with
PRNG). For fair comparisons, we use the original implementa-
tion of PIR-PSI [45] and SealPIR [47], and we use the original
values for retrieved ﬁle sizes used in their implementations.

AN OVERVIEW OF PIR DESIGNS
Information-Theoretic PIR (ITPIR) protocols ITPIR proto-
cols require more than one server, and there is an assumption
that these servers are not colluding. These protocols have
two main advantages, ﬁrst they are fast since they do not
use complicated cryptography operations. Second, the query
