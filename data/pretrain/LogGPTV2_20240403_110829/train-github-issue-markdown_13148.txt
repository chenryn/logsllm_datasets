## Expected Behavior
HTML pages generated by `next export` command should render initial view as
quickly as possible.
## Current Behavior
JS is loaded before everything else:
If those `` tags are removed, the JS still loads a bit
sooner than I would prefer.
One solution is to replace these lines:
With something like:
I've cobbled together a crude / brittle approach to making both of these
modifications:
  1. `npm install --save-dev replace-in-file`
  2. Add the file in this gist to your project root.
  3. Add something like the following to `package.json`:
      "scripts": {
        "export": "next export && node export_postprocess.js",
      },
## Your Environment
Tech | Version  
---|---  
next | 4.3.0-canary.1  
node | 8.9.4  
OS | OS X 10.13.2  
## Notes
The HTML snippet shown above after "One solution is to replace these lines" is
as seen in `next.js 4.3.0-canary.1`. In `4.2.1` these lines are slightly
different (line 3 empty div, line 5 closing div):
The `export_postprocess.js` node script (see gist link above) takes this
difference into account.
## Next Steps
Should these changes be applied (in a cleaner way) to the `export` tool? As
options or as defaults?
Would be interested in hearing how these changes affect the loading sequence
for others.
