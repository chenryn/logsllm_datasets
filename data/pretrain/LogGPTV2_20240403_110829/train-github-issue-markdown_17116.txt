**System information**
  * TensorFlow version (you are using): 1.12.0
  * Are you willing to contribute it (Yes/No): Yes
**Describe the feature and the current behavior/state.**
The STFT Tensorflow function takes into consideration the Hermitian symmetry
of the generated output i.e. it only considers the positive frequency
elements. Is there a way to recover the entire pre-processed tensor that
contains all the calculated elements?
In other words, is there a way to calculate the STFT of an input tensor and
generate a spectrogram that has dimensions `fft_length * frame_length`?
**Will this change the current api? How?**
This will just add an additional feature to the existing function.
**Who will benefit with this feature?**
Anyone who is doing audio processing using Tensorflow.
**Any Other info.**
