User: I have bigs files to move to a lot of servers. For now we use rsync, but I would like to experiment with bittorent.
I'm studing the code of Deluge, a Python bittorent client but it uses twisted and is utterly complex. Do you know anything hight level?
EDIT: I just read that Facebook does code deployment using Bittorent. Maybe they published their lib for that, but I can't find it. Ever hear of it?
Assistant: The original BitTorrent client is written in Python. Have you checked that out?
