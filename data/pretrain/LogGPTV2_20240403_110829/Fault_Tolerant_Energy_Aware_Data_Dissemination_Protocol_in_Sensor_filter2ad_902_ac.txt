End-to-end  delay  at  C  is  dependent  on  whether  B 
requests the data or not.
Case  (a.a) B  also  requests  the  data.  The  entire  A-B 
sequence  is  repeated  twice  for  the  two  hops.  Here  we 
assume  that  TOutADV      is  adjusted  properly  so  that  the 
timer does not go off before B sends ADV. 
The  delay  for  C  to  get  the  packet  is  given  by

Case (a.b) B does not request the data. C does a timeout 
TOutADV  after  which  it  requests  the  data  through  B,  i.e. 
2(cid:664)R(cid:664)Ttx and  processing  delay  at  A  and  B  of  that  REQ 
packet which is 2(cid:664)Tproc. Finally A routes the data through 
B  which  takes  2(cid:664)D(cid:664)T  tx  and  a  Tproc  .  C  receives  the  data 
and  incurs  a  delay  of  Tproc.  With  each  channel  access, 
there is a CSMA/CA delay to access the channel.

Case  (a.c)  K  relay  nodes  between  A  and  C.  The  worst 
case  delay  occurs  when  the  last  relay  node  doesn’t 
request the data. For the first (k-1) nodes the data ripples 
through for a time of (k-1) Tround and then it is the same 
case as analyzed in the previous section when B doesn’t 
request the data and we calculate the delay for C.

b) Failure case 
If  B  fails  before  sending  the  ADV,  there  is  a  TOutADV
incurred  at  C  and  then  C  requests  the  data  from  A 
through  B.  If  B  fails  after  sending  out  the  ADV,  C 
requests  B  for  the  data  packet.  Since  B  has  failed,  in 
either  case  the  (cid:87)DAT  timer  runs  through  the  complete 
TOutDAT  and  finally  requests  the  data  from  A.  For  the 
case when B fails before sending out the ADV,

Figure 3. A sample scenario with k intermediate 
relay nodes 
Consider  Figure  3  where  there  is  a  chain  of  k
intermediate nodes, one intermediate node fails, which is 
not the last one, say the jth node from  the last one fails. 
There are (k-j) rounds for data to get to the (k-j)th node. 
Then there is a TOutADV as C does not hear the ADV. C 
sends  the  REQ  through  the  shortest  route  (having  the 
failed node) and in the process incurs a delay of TOutDAT
and finally it requests through the last heard node which 
is the (k-j)th node. Considering nj is the number of nodes
