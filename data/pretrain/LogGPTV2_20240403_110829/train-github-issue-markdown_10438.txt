### Issue Description
I am unable to build TensorFlow due to an error related to the `@png_archive` package. The following is the detailed error message:

```plaintext

### Error Summary
The error indicates that the `patch` command is not found, which is required to apply a patch to the `png_archive` package. This is likely due to the `patch` utility not being installed or not being available in the system's PATH.

### Steps to Resolve
1. **Install the `patch` Utility:**
   - Ensure that the `patch` utility is installed on your system. On Windows, you can use MSYS2 or Git Bash, which typically include the `patch` command.
   - If you are using MSYS2, make sure it is properly installed and the `patch` command is available in the `E:\MSYS2\usr\bin` directory.

2. **Add `patch` to the System PATH:**
   - Add the directory containing the `patch` executable to your system's PATH environment variable.

3. **Re-run the Build Command:**
   - After ensuring that the `patch` command is available, re-run the build command:
     ```sh
     bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
     ```

If the issue persists, please provide additional details about your environment and any other relevant information.
