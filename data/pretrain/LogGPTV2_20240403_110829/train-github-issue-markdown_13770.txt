    I'm trying to profile a cgo package. See the attached test case.
    When running with clang "top" looks like this:
    Total: 526 samples
          66  12.5%  12.5%       66  12.5% 000000000402483b
          57  10.8%  23.4%       57  10.8% 0000000004024761
          25   4.8%  28.1%       25   4.8% 0000000004018c22
          18   3.4%  31.6%       18   3.4% 0000000004017bf7
          11   2.1%  33.7%       11   2.1% 0000000004018c55
           8   1.5%  35.2%        8   1.5% 0000000004017b64
           8   1.5%  36.7%        8   1.5% 0000000004017c88
           8   1.5%  38.2%        8   1.5% 0000000004018c60
           7   1.3%  39.5%        7   1.3% 0000000004017b86
           7   1.3%  40.9%        7   1.3% 0000000004018c45
    When running with gcc 4.8 "top" looks like this:
    Total: 531 samples
         531 100.0% 100.0%      531 100.0% 000000000402567b
           0   0.0% 100.0%      531 100.0% 0000000004018e60
    In both cases I'm getting addresses instead of names. With gcc all the samples are
    appearing as a single address. This happens with C or C++ code. C++ is attached. Rename
    .cc to .c and comment out #ifdef in .h file to make C.
    I'm running:
    CX=g++-4.8 gotip test -c
    ./cgotest.test -test.cpuprofile=prof.out -test.bench=. -test.benchtime=3s -test.v
    gotip tool pprof cgotest.test prof.out
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    default w/ clang++
    default w/ GNU g++ 4.8
    default w/ clang
    default w/ GNU gcc 4.8
    Which operating system are you using?
