User: I have created a Google App Engine project where it's possible to upload photos. Uploading part is working fine and all the photos are uploaded in proper size. But when I try getting images.get_serving_url , it returns me serving_url appended with lh3.googleusercontent.com but according to GoogleAppEngine documentation it must return serving_url something like lh3.gghpt.com . Also, the problem which comes is that the photos on that serving_url is 4-6 times smaller than the uploaded ones and when I view in the GoogleAppEngine console, all those photos have same size as the uploaded ones. I don't know why GoogleAppEngine is not returning the actual sized images.
Assistant: Try specifying size=0 in the images.get_serving_url method call.
eg. images.get_serving_url(blob_key, size=0)
