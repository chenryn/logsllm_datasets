**Issue with Image Serving URLs in Google App Engine**

I have developed a Google App Engine project that allows users to upload photos. The photo upload functionality is working correctly, and all images are uploaded at the appropriate size. However, I am encountering an issue when using `images.get_serving_url`.

When I call `images.get_serving_url`, it returns a serving URL that includes `lh3.googleusercontent.com`. According to the Google App Engine documentation, the serving URL should include `lh3.gghpt.com` instead.

Additionally, the images served from the generated URL are 4-6 times smaller than the original uploaded images. When I check the images in the Google App Engine console, they display at the correct, original size. I am unsure why the serving URL is not providing the actual-sized images.

**Suggested Solution:**

To address this issue, try specifying `size=0` in the `images.get_serving_url` method call. This should return the image at its original size.

Example:
```python
images.get_serving_url(blob_key, size=0)
```
