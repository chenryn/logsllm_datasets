the incentive misalignment, providing guidelines for future
cryptocurrency design.

Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies secure a decentralized
consensus protocol by incentives. The protocol participants,
called miners, generate (mine) a series of blocks, each con-
taining monetary transactions created by system users. As
incentive for participation, miners receive newly minted
currency and transaction fees paid by transaction creators.
Blockchain bandwidth limits lead users to pay increasing
fees in order to prioritize their transactions. However, most
prior work focused on models where fees are negligible. In a
notable exception, Carlsten et al. [1] postulated in CCS’16
that if incentives come only from fees then a mining gap
would form — miners would avoid mining when the available
fees are insufficient.
In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realis-
tic settings, taking into account all elements of expenses and
rewards. To study when gaps form, we analyze the system
as a game we call the gap game. We analyze the game with
a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools in a
wide range of scenarios.
Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.’s postulate; indeed,
we show that gaps form well before fees are the only in-
centive, and analyze the implications on security. Perhaps
surprisingly, we show that different miners choose different
gap sizes to optimize their utility, even when their operat-
ing costs are identical. Alarmingly, we see that the system
