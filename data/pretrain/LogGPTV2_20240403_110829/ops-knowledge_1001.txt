User: How to configure Nginx reverse proxy to implement domain name-based virtual hosting? Please give a configuration example.
Assistant: To configure Nginx reverse proxy to implement domain name-based virtual hosting, the following steps are required: 1. Edit the Nginx configuration file, such as /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, and add the following content: ``` http { ... server { listen 80; # Listen to port 80, or you can change it to another port server_name example.com; # Set the domain name of the virtual host location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; # Specify the source site IP and port of the proxy} } ... } ``` 2. Restart the Nginx service for the configuration to take effect. You can use the following command to check whether the Nginx configuration is correct and reload the configuration file: ``` sudo nginx -t sudo systemctl reload nginx ``` 3. Test whether the virtual host takes effect. You can use the curl tool to simulate HTTP requests, such as: ``` curl -H "Host: example.com" http://127.0.0.1/ ``` The above command will send an HTTP request and specify the "Host" header For "example.com", so that Nginx can correctly match to the virtual host. If everything is fine, Nginx will proxy the request to http://localhost:8080.
