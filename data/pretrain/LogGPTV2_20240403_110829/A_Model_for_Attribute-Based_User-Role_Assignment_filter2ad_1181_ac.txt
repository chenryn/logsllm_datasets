5. Case II: Military Equipment Spare Parts  
A corps maintains supplies of military equipment spare 
parts  that  are  usually  stored  at  different  geographical 
locations. Maintenance of military equipment consists 
of  multiple  echelons,  with  varying  degrees  of  depth 
from  organizational  (OM),  to  intermediate  (IM),  to 
depot-level  maintenance  (DM)  [11].  Maintenance 
personnel  at  different  levels  need  access  to  logistical 
databases  to  order  spare  parts  they  need,  locate  the 
nearest warehouse of a needed spare part, or follow up 
the status of spare parts and repair orders. For security 
reasons,  the  information  displayed  to  maintenance 
personnel and the privileges they exercise depend on a 
group of factors which includes: 
a)  Unit’s geographical location 
b)  Type of equipment  
c)  Unit’s alert status  
d)  Maintenance  Level:  usually,  OM,  IM,  and  DM 
are performed by different maintenance entities. 
For simplicity, we will ignore the IM level.

In  our  discussion,  we  will  consider  the  case  of

peacetime and wartime (WT). Variations in alert status

5.1. Attributes’ Representation 
We will represent Maintenance Level and Alert Status. 
The  organization  can  specify  the  following  non-
terminal items: 
i)  Attribute ::= Maintenance Level | Alert Status 
ii)  Attribute_Value ::= OM | DM | Peacetime  
| Wartime 
iii)  Role::= r1 | r2 | r1.1 | r2.1  
Based on the above, we can use the language to define 
the following rules: 
Rule 1:: (Maintenance Level = OM AND Alert  
Status = Peacetime) (cid:198) r1 
Rule 2:: (Maintenance Level = DM AND Alert  
Status = Peacetime) (cid:198) r2 
Rule 3:: (Maintenance Level = OM AND Alert  
Status = Wartime) (cid:198) r1.1 
Rule 4:: (Maintenance Level = DM AND Alert  
Status = Wartime) (cid:198) r2.1 
5.2. Implementing MAC Using the Language

MAC is  widely used in military organizations so it is 
reasonable 
of 
implementing it using the language defined above. We 
modify  our  example  by 
introducing  a  second 
equipment type: Missile. Alert status is ignored to keep 
this  example  simple.  This  yields  the  hierarchical 
classes  and  compartments  shown  in  Figure  9,  which

2.  A “write” role hierarchy that has a partial order 
that is the inverse of dominances (≥MAC). Role OM-
W  dominates  all  other  write  roles,  which  enables 
users  to  write  data  to  levels  in  the  security  lattice 
that are higher than their own.

assigned  to  exactly  two  roles:  xR  and  OM-W, 
where x is the label assigned to the user. OM-W is 
the  write  role  corresponding  to  the  lowermost 
security level according to (≥LBAC). 
Each user is assigned a read role yR and its companion 
write  role  yW.  Table  7  shows 
the  roles  with

Read and write roles are assigned according to (Liberal 
*-Property) as shown in Table 8. Each line in the last 
column of the table shows the roles that are assigned to 
the user at any one time.  
The  organization  can  specify  the  following  non-
terminal items: 
i)  Attribute ::= Maintenance Level  
| Equipment Type 
ii) Attribute_Value ::= OM | DM | HP | Missile 
iii) Roles: {read and write roles in Table 8} 
We can use the language to specify the following rules: 
Rule 1:: (Maintenance Level = OM  AND  
Equipment Type = HP)  
(cid:198) (OM,{A}-R AND OM,{A}-W) 
Rule 2:: (Maintenance Level = DM  AND  
Equipment Type = HP)  
(cid:198) ((DM,{A}-R AND DM,{A}-W))  
XOR  
((OM,{A}-R AND OM,{A}-W)) 
Rule 3:: (Maintenance Level = OM  AND 
Equipment Type = Missile)  
(cid:198) (OM,{B}-R AND OM,{B}-W) 
Rule 4:: (Maintenance Level = DM  AND  
Equipment Type = Missile)  
(cid:198) ((DM,{B}-R AND DM,{B}-W))  
XOR 
((OM,{B}-R AND OM,{B}-W)) 
The language allows us to capture mutually exclusive 
roles as shown in the rules above.

The language we present is simple and can be used to 
express  situations beyond the study cases provided in 
this paper. For example, a user’s membership in a role 
is  an  attribute  of  paramount  importance  in  many 
applications.  Assume  that  the  security  policy  of  an 
enterprise  allows  a  client  to  be  assigned  a  “team 
leader”  role  only  if  he  is  already  a  member  in  a 
“programmer” role. This can be represented as follows:  
Attribute_Pair ::= Attribute IN Set 
where 
Attribute  ::=  required-role  {attribute’s  name  is 
specified by the enterprise} 
Set ::= {programmer} 
Similarly,  suppose  that  the  security  policy  allows  the 
client to retain the role that is currently assigned to him 
during regular working hours only. This condition can 
be captured as:  
Attribute_Pair ::= Attribute IN Range 
where 
Attribute ::= time {defined by the organization} 
Range ::= 900..1700 {from 9 am to 5 pm} 
When  time  is  not  within  this  range,  the  role  is 
automatically revoked from the client. 
However, the language needs to be extended to allow 
more expressive power. One area that we are working 
on is devising a  way for expressing constraints. Also, 
the  interaction  between  seniority  among  rules  and 
seniority  among  roles  is  yet  to  be  explored.  For 
example,  in  many  scenarios,  by  examining  seniority 
among rules, one can derive a hierarchy among roles. 
By going back to the rules derived from Table 2, one 
can deduce that role Child is junior to Juvenile.  
Our  model uses seniority levels to compare a client’s 
attributes  to  existing  assignment  rules,  or  to  compare 
two assignment rules. We will work to make seniority 
level comparisons less restricted to allow insight about 
relationships  among  rules.  We  will  also  explore  the 
usability  of  our  model 
role-to-permission 
assignment.  More  importantly,  we  will  extend  our

model  to  allow  cross-domain  dynamic  user-to-role 
assignment to reduce administrative work for security 
administrators. 
We  have  described  a  model  to  dynamically  assign 
users to roles based on a finite set of rules defined by 
authorized people in an enterprise. We believe that our 
model  will  be  useful  in  automatically—rather  than 
manually—managing  users  to  role(s)  assignment  and 
revocation in enterprises with large client bases.
