### Forum Activity and Viewership

The forums in our dataset exhibited varying levels of activity and reported viewership. Table 1 provides a detailed comparison of the five forums, including their size, user engagement, and specific metrics related to thread and post activity. Notably, Forum C does not provide viewership information, as indicated by dashes in the table.

<sup>α</sup> Calculated via qualitative analysis of random samples of 250 threads per non-spam forum, see Section 5.

In total, the forums contain 18,937 threads, with Forum C being the largest in terms of both threads and posts.

### Activity Patterns

Activity data, including the times of thread and post creation, was available for all forums. We observed that activity on Forums A and B peaked between 2010 and 2015, but has significantly declined in the past five years. In contrast, activity on Forum C has surged during this period. This trend may indicate a shift from niche forums focused on infidelity to larger social media platforms like Reddit. Despite the recent drop-offs, these forums remain valuable resources for potential abusers, containing tools and tactics that are still relevant today. Therefore, we included them in our qualitative analysis (Section 5).

While Forums A, B, and C exhibit similar seasonal and diurnal patterns, Forums D and E show greater variability, with strong peaks in posting activity in 2013 and 2014, respectively. This reflects concentrated activity by advertisers posting spam marketing for spyware products.

### Viewership and Engagement

The total number of views across all forums is approximately 30 million, which is likely an underestimate given the lack of viewership data for Reddit's Forum C. Within each forum, the distribution of views per thread is dominated by one or two highly viewed threads (typically "sticky" threads compiling forum rules or shared resources), followed by a long tail of less-viewed threads. The distributions of thread lengths follow a similar long-tail pattern, with an average thread length of six posts.

### Forum Users and Superusers

Table 1 also shows the number of unique users in each forum, identified by comparing usernames attached to each post via case-insensitive string equality. The number of unique users varies, from 264 in Forum D to 12,740 in Forum C. All forums have "superusers" who account for a disproportionate number of posts. Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the fraction of each forum’s posts made by users and a histogram of the fractions of all threads to which a user posted. For clarity, only the 50 and 25 most prolific users are shown.

Forums E and D are outliers compared to the other forums, primarily due to spammers. While the other three forums also have superusers, they do not dominate to the same extent. Some superusers are human and robot moderators, such as an automatic moderator on Forum C that posts the subreddit’s rules as the first response to each thread. Most superusers, however, appear to be highly engaged humans who drive the community's culture and activity through their posts.

We also checked for cross-forum activity by comparing usernames. Only eight users were found to be active across multiple forums, with no structural reason for connection. Of these, only one user contributed more than 1% of posts or threads in any forum. This suggests that superusers are not frequently cross-posting, though it is easy to register accounts with different usernames. Identifying users across forums remains an area for future work.

### Spyware Spam and SEO Inflation in Forums D and E

Forums D and E stand out in several dimensions. Most content in these forums can be attributed to a few users. In Forum D, the top user contributed to 95% of threads and authored 45% of posts, while the second-most-active user contributed to 95% of threads and authored 44% of posts. Forum E exhibits a similar pattern of dominance.

Inspection reveals that many threads in Forum D consist of conversations between its top two users, where one posts a spam advertisement for a spyware tool, and the other responds briefly. This strategy appears to be a form of search engine optimization (SEO) employed by the company behind the spyware tool to boost the forum’s visibility and attract attention to their product. Specifically, 94% of the posts made by the top user were identical advertisements for the spyware tool, and this user authored nearly half (45%) of the posts on the forum. The second-most-prolific user in Forum D also follows a similar pattern.
