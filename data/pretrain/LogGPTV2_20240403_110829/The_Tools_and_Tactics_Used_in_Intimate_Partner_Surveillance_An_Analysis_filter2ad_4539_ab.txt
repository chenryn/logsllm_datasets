Table 1: Comparison of the ﬁve forums in our dataset. Forum C does not provide viewership information (marked by dashes).
α Calculated via qualitative analysis of random samples of 250 threads per non-spam forum, see Section 5.
total, the forums contain 18,937 threads, with Forum C con-
taining the most threads and posts (Table 1).
Activity data in terms of thread and post times was avail-
able for all forums. We note that activity on Forums A and B
peaked between 2010 and 2015, and has signiﬁcantly dropped
off in the last ﬁve years, while activity on Forum C has ex-
ploded in that time (Figure 1). We hypothesize this may repre-
sent a shift away from niche forums focused on inﬁdelity and
towards niche subcommunities of larger social media plat-
forms like Reddit. Despite the recent drop-offs, these forums
remain publicly available resources for would-be abusers, and
contain IPS tools and tactics that are still relevant today; thus
we included them in our qualitative analysis (Section 5).
While these three forums exhibit similar seasonal and di-
urnal patterns, temporal patterns for Forums E and D exhibit
greater variability, as well as strong peaks in year-over-year
posting activity in 2013 and 2014, respectively. As we will
discuss subsequently, this reﬂects concentrated activity by
advertisers posting spam marketing spyware products.
Across all forums, the total number of views was approxi-
mately 30 M. This is likely a signiﬁcant underestimate of total
viewership given that it does not include Reddit’s Forum C,
for which we do not have viewership data. Within each fo-
rum, the distribution of views per thread was dominated by
one or two highly viewed threads (usually ‘sticky’ threads
compiling forum rules or shared resources) and then a long
tail of less-viewed threads. The distributions of thread lengths
for each forum followed similar long-tail patterns, with an
average thread length of six posts.
Forum users and “superusers”. Table 1 shows the number
of users in each forum, identiﬁed by comparing the usernames
attached to each post via case-insensitive string equality. Fo-
rums differed in the number of unique users, from 264 in
Forum D to 12,740 in Forum C, but all forums have “supe-
rusers” that account for a disproportionate number of posts.
Figure 2 gives (left chart) a CDF of the fraction of each fo-
rum’s posts made by users and (right chart) a histogram of
the fractions of all threads to which a user posted. For clarity,
we only show the 50 and 25 most proliﬁc users, respectively.
Forums E and D are clear outliers compared to the other
forums; this is due to spammers, as we discuss below. While
the other three forums also have superusers, they do not dom-
inate their forums to the same degree. Additionally, cursory
examination shows they are not spammers. Some are human
and robot moderators, including an automatic moderator on
Forum C that posts the subreddit’s rules as the ﬁrst response
to each thread-starting post. But most superusers appear to be
humans particularly engaged in the forum, driving the culture
and activity of the community with their posts.
We additionally checked whether posters were active in
multiple forums in our data. Comparing usernames via case-
insensitive string equality, we found just eight users recurring
across forums that had no structural reason to be connected.
Of these, only one user made contributions that exceeded 1%
of posts or threads in any forum. While this ﬁnding seems
to indicate superusers are not cross-posting across multiple
forums, we note it is simple to register accounts with different
usernames in these forums. We consider the identiﬁcation of
users across forums to be an area of future work.
Spyware spam and SEO inﬂation in Forums D and E. As
mentioned above, Forums D and E stood out along many di-
mensions. Most content in these two forums can be attributed
to a handful of users: notably, the top user in Forum D con-
tributed to 95% of threads and authored 45% of posts, and the
second-most-active user contributed to 95% of threads and
authored 44% of posts. Forum E exhibits a similar pattern of
dominance by a handful of users.
Inspection shows many of the threads in Forum D constitute
conversations between its top two users: one posts a spam
advertisement for a spyware tool, and another follows up with
a short response. We conclude this demonstrates a strategy of
search engine optimization (SEO) employed by the company
behind the spyware tool to boost the forum’s visibility on
Internet searches and attract attention to their spyware product.
Speciﬁcally, 94% of the posts made by the top user were
the same message: an advertisement for the spyware tool.
This user also authored nearly half (45%) of the posts on this
forum. Forum D’s second-most-proliﬁc user bears a username
