To format numbers within a template, you can use the following syntax:

- `{{123456 | number}}`
- `{{123456 | number:'4.2-2'}}`

On desktop browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer 10, the value is correctly formatted as:

- `123,456`
- `123,456.00`

However, on mobile browsers running on an iPad with iOS 9.2.1 (specifically Chrome 47, Safari, and Firefox 2.0), the formatting fails, resulting in an empty value.
