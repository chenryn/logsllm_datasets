User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of running tasks in stage 28.0. Two python runners reported times for total, boot, init, and finish. Four tasks (10.0, 11.0, 12.0, and 13.0) were finished and sent results to the driver. Three blocks (rdd_42_15, rdd_42_17, and rdd_42_16) were found locally. Lastly, two tasks (15.0 and 16.0) were assigned and running.
