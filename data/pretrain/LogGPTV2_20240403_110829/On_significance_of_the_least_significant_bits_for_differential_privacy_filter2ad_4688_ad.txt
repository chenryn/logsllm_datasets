5.2 Snapping Mechanism
′
In contrast with the ﬁrst ﬂawed method of the previous
section, where the lower bits of the Laplacian noise are sim-
ply tossed out, it turns out that doing so after adding the
noise yields a diﬀerentially private mechanism. The tech-
nique has been proposed in a diﬀerent context by Dodis et
al. [7], where it was shown to be an eﬀective defense strategy
when the mechanism is instantiated with imperfect random-
ness, modeled as a Santha-Vazirani source [40].
∗
Before we deﬁne the mechanism, which is proved to be
diﬀerentially private in Theorem 1, we introduce some no-
be the uniform distribution over D ∩ (0, 1),
tation. Let U
such that each double number is output with probability
proportional to its ulp; S be uniform over {−1, +1}. LN(·)
denotes a ﬂoating-point implementation of the natural loga-
rithm with exact rounding. Function clampB(x) outputs B
if x > B, −B if x  exp
≥ exp(−3.1Bη/λ).

To obtain an upper and lower bounds on |l − r| in terms
of |L − R|, we observe that
L ≤ l ≤ L,
R ≤ r ≤ R,
by applying Lemma 1 twice. Thus,
|L − R| ≤ |l − r| ≤ |L − R|.
(3)
For this we need L  exp(−3.1Bη/λ)R − exp(2Bη/λ)L (by Lemma 2)
= L · (exp(Λ/λ − 3.1Bη/λ) − exp(2Bη/λ))
> L · (exp(Λ/λ) − 1) exp(−7Bη/λ)
= (R − L) exp(−7Bη/λ),
and
R − L  ulp(l), which is a common
occurrence:
r − l ≤ Pr[U

= r + ulp(r) − (l + ulp(l))

when l  λ.
Since the mechanism “snaps” the output of a ﬂoating-point
computation to the nearest multiple of Λ, the error it intro-
duces relative to the underlying Laplacian mechanisms is at
most Λ/2 < λ. Before the outer clamping is applied, the
(4)
658mechanism is unbiased. Depending on the relative magni-
tude of the range of f (·), λ and B, the bias introduced by
clamping may be exceedingly small.
6. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
In this section we brieﬂy describe another vulnerability
at the intersection of diﬀerential privacy and ﬂoating-point
arithmetic.
Accurate analysis of sensitivity is essential to most meth-
ods in diﬀerential privacy. The function f may be a combi-
