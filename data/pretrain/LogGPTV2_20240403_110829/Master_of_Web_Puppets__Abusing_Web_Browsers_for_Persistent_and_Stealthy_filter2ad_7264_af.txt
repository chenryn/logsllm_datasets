resources are abused to perform malicious actions including
DDoS attacks to remote targets, cryptojacking, malicious/illegal
data hosting, and darknet deployment. Two important charac-
teristics of MarioNet, that further highlight the severity of the
aforementioned attacks, is that it provides persistence, thus
allowing an attacker to continue their malicious computation
even after the user navigates away from the malicious website.
In addition, MarioNet provides evasiveness, performing all
operations in a completely stealthy way, thus bypassing the
existing in-browser detection mechanisms.
Essentially, our work demonstrates that the trust model of
web, which considers web publishers as trusted and allows them
to execute code on the client-side without any restrictions is
ﬂawed and needs reconsideration. Furthermore, this work aims
to increase the awareness regarding the powerful capabilities
that modern browser APIs provide to attackers, and to initiate
a serious discussion about implementing restrictions while
offering such capabilities that can be easily abused.
