### An Agile DDoS Defense Framework Leveraging Programmable Switches

#### Programmable Switches
Researchers have explored the use of programmable switches to accelerate various applications in networking and distributed systems. Examples include:
- Layer-4 load balancing [51, 58]
- Network resource allocation mechanisms [69]
- Key-value stores [35, 48]
- Coordination services [34, 46, 47]
- Fair queueing [70]
- Fast connectivity recovery [32]
- Network monitoring and measurement tasks [73, 55, 74, 75, 30, 87]

These applications achieve significantly better performance and lower costs compared to their software counterparts running on commodity servers. POSEIDON is inspired by these works but focuses on DDoS defense, providing a systematic approach to integrating programmable switches into the current DDoS defense framework.

#### Policy Languages
There are numerous domain-specific languages in the networking and security communities aimed at simplifying policy expression, such as Chimera [8], NetCore/NetKAT [2, 65, 4, 25, 24], and PSI [89]. Although our key idea of software-defined programmable security is not tied to any specific language, we extend the POSEIDON policy language based on Pyretic NetCore [53] to hide underlying hardware complexity and reduce operator burden. This provides a high-level abstraction tailored for DDoS defenses.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we highlight the challenges in today's DDoS defense and identify new opportunities that programmable switches bring for mitigating volumetric DDoS attacks. We introduce POSEIDON, a performant, cost-efficient, and agile DDoS defense system that addresses the key limitations in current DDoS defense mechanisms. 

The POSEIDON language provides a simple, modular DDoS policy abstraction that supports a range of policies while shielding the low-level hardware complexity. The POSEIDON orchestration component offers an optimized, efficient resource orchestration mechanism to map high-level policy primitives to the underlying hardware resources. The POSEIDON runtime manager provides a transparent, effective scheme to adapt to attack dynamics, ensuring resource utilization efficiency and guaranteeing correctness for legitimate flows.

Our implementation and evaluation demonstrate that POSEIDON is highly effective in mitigating attacks with negligible overheads. These results show that POSEIDON is an effective system for mitigating modern, advanced DDoS attacks.
