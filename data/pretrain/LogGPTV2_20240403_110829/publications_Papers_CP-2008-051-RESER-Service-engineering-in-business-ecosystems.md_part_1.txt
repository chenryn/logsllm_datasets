Service providers are increasingly forced to cooperate to strengthen their
core competencies and to create partner networks to offer new services.
In order to facilitate the collaboration process, business ecosystems have
been building which allow service providers to offer their own as well as
combined e-services with other providers over the Internet. This paper in-
troduces the Inter-enterprise Service Engineering methodology (ISE)
which has been developed in the Texo use case1 of the Theseus project2
and provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and model-driven ap-
proach to e-service development in business ecosystems. One major aim
of ISE is to integrate business as well as technical stakeholders in the e-
service development process and support them with appropriate models,
methods, and tools.
1. Introduction
All industrial nations feature large and fast growing service sectors. In Germany, for
example, 72 percent of the labour force in 2007 earns its living within the service sec-
tor. This sector has been the fastest growing sector in Germany for more than 15
years3. In other industrial countries the situation and the trend are comparable
(Maglio et al., 2006). Due to this trend, service providers reveal a strong interest for
service innovations and their development which will enable them to achieve a com-
petitive market position and to participate in future economic growth (Rai & Samba-
murthy, 2006).
In order to reach a competitive advantage, companies should not offer a broad range
of services but rather focus on selected core competencies. Ideally, core competen-
cies will enable to offer services which their customers perceive as better than the
ones from competitors. However, customers tend to require not only individual ser-
vices, but they ask for complete and integrated solutions (Bieger & Rüegg-Stürm,
2002). This trend urges companies to collaborate with partners, even with former
competitors, to offer the appropriate and required services.

Having this background, business ecosystems have been developed where inde-
pendent companies collaborate to offer services concertedly. The ecosystems con-
sist of highly networked social and technical resources which produce an economic
value by cooperating (Kagermann & Österle, 2006). In this context, services are an
integral part of a value chain network which will take up a more important role in the
future. In order to realize this potential, services need to become tradable goods simi-
lar to products (Janiesch et al., 2008).
An appropriate infrastructure is needed to offer and provide these services via the
Internet. The ability to combine services is a central and crucial feature to develop
new and innovative services on the basis of existing ones. Services of different pro-
viders can be combined and integrated. Here, the focus lays on web-based services
(so-called e-services) which are accessible via the Internet (Janiesch et al., 2008).
2. Objective and Structure
Many methodologies exist to support the development of services. Some of the ap-
proaches are business oriented (e.g. New Service Development and Service Engi-
neering (Daun & Klein, 2004)) while others have a stronger emphasis on more tech-
nical aspects (e.g. software developing methodologies based on the OSI model or on
Service-Oriented Architectures). Depending on the orientation, most of the ap-
proaches focus either on business or on technical aspects of the service realization.
Therefore, the approaches lack an interdisciplinary perspective (Buhl et al., 2008).
Nevertheless, new interdisciplinary approaches are emerging in the context of Ser-
vice Science which aims to academically examine the field of service development
(Chesbrough & Spohrer, 2006). So far, we could not identify suitable approaches
from Service Science which address the development of e-services in business eco-
systems.
The objective of this paper is to introduce a new methodology which supports the
development process of e-services from the creation of a business model to the im-
plementation. The methodology is called Inter-enterprise Service Engineering (ISE)
and provides a basis for companies which are interested in participating in the coop-
erative e-service development process within business ecosystems.
This paper is structured as followed. In section 3, the strength and weaknesses of
current business and technical oriented approaches are shown and the need for an
interdisciplinary Service Engineering methodology which covers business as well as
technical aspects is explained. The ISE methodology is introduced in section 4 based
on selected methods of Service Engineering and Computer Science. Their integra-
tion into a broad and interdisciplinary methodology is described. Section 5 presents
our conclusions and our future work.
3. State of the Art in Service Development
Prior to participating in business ecosystems, companies need to have an under-
standing of e-service development and integration of business partners and their e-
2
services. In order to facilitate this process an appropriate methodology should be
drawn which provides guidelines for the e-service development process for compa-
nies joining business ecosystems. We have examined current approaches for their
suitability to e-service development. Depending on the different types of stakeholders
who are involved in the service development process, e.g. business developers,
business analysts, IT analysts, and IT developers, the underlying understanding of a
service differs. The involved stakeholders and their service definitions can be divided
into two main types which are influenced by a business and a technical understand-
ing of services:
A business-oriented service definition contains often the following features
(Corsten, 1997;Rai & Sambamurthy, 2006;Chesbrough & Spohrer, 2006)):
• Immateriality,
• Production and consumption happen simultaneously (Uno-actu-principle),
• Integration of the customer as an external factor in the service delivery process.
When analyzing e-services from a business perspective, the traditional service view
and features may not apply. For example, the Uno-actu-principle and the integration
of the customer might become less applicable or even obsolete if e-services can be
offered by providers and bought by customers in a similar way to products in e-
shops. In this case, e-services are already produced prior to consuming by cos-
tumers (Scheer et al., 2003).
From a technical-oriented service definition mostly the functionality of the e-
service interfaces needs to comply with certain features (Papazoglou,
2003;Papazoglou et al., 2006):
• Self descriptive: The annotation of meta-data allows the assignment of descrip-
tions or quality criteria to services.
• Platform independent: The service is independent of the underlying soft- and
hardware.
• Composition: Distributed applications and their functionality can be realized by
composition and linkage.
• Application of standards: The functionality of a service is offered via network
and standardized languages and protocols.
• Loose coupling: Neither context information nor further information of the inter-
nal functionality are needed by the service provider and consumer. Here, a dy-
namic real-time (at the time of usage) integration of the services by using ac-
cepted invocation mechanisms should be sufficient.
• Transparency of location: The service can be found and invoked independently
of the location of the service provider by registration in a service directory.
The technical-oriented service definition mainly focuses on implementational aspects
of e-services. The business context is widely neglected.

To identify the strengths and weaknesses of business- and technical-oriented ap-
proaches for service development, we have setup a set of criteria for their compari-
son. This set of criteria has been built on an aggregation of the main parts of existing
service development approaches and our understanding of the essential parts of e-
service development. Thus, the following criteria are compared for each type of ser-
vice development approach to identify its strengths and weaknesses:
• Methodology: Provides a clear procedure which guides stakeholders through the
development process.
• Service innovation: Involves understanding the market and to derive ideas for
new services.
• Business model: Builds the basis for the business-oriented service description.
• Business processes: Introduce the service delivery process.
• Architecture: Provides a set of abstraction levels, views, meta models, and pat-
terns to classify and distinguish components of services from an IT perspective,
• Service ecosystems: Indicates that services are a result of a collaboration of
several business partners and thus, the service development cannot only rely on
techniques dedicated only for service development within one organization,
• Model-driven architecture (MDA): Offers a technology to structurally develop,
integrate and support the perspectives of different stakeholders in the service de-
velopment process based on models. MDA allows the transformation from one
model to another model.
3.1. Business-oriented Service Development Approaches
When having a closer look at business-oriented service development approaches
two main streams of scientific activities exist: New Service Development (NSD) and
Service Engineering (SE) (Daun & Klein, 2004). Since the 80’s NSD has mainly been
driven by Anglo-American researchers with a strong marketing focus, whereas, SE
has been pushed by German researchers for the past 15 years. The main aim of SE
is to provide a systematic service development by applying engineering know-how
from traditional product development.
Both streams include a variety of different methodological approaches which slightly
differ in their phases. In order to compare the orientation between both streams, the
phases of each stream have been aggregated in Table 1 On the one hand, NSD ap-
.
proaches include the development of a business and/or service strategy and the test-
ing of services after development. On the other hand, some of the SE methods ex-
plicitly mention Service Provisioning and the Displacement of services which are
phased out.
The focus of the approaches is mainly on traditional services which feature a direct
customer contact and customer interaction. Here, a part of the service delivery proc-
ess takes place in interaction with the customers. Especially those process steps in
interaction with customers need to be carefully planned and implemented since they
strongly influence the customer’s perception. However, when e-services are sold
4
similarly to products, those aspects may become less relevant since the e-service is
already produced before it is requested and the interaction between provider and
customer decreases.

In conclusion, the business-oriented approaches of service development show the
following weaknesses (Daun & Klein, 2004):
• Insufficient details: In most cases only the high-level processes are described,
whereas, concrete activities and methods are missing.
• Lack of IT-centric approaches: IT-issues are discussed to develop or support
the provisioning of traditional services on the basis of a business-oriented service
definition (Buhl et al., 2008). The development of pure e-services and the consid-
eration of technical aspects as listed in the technical service definition are not in
the focus.

oriented approaches.

proach is briefly introduced with a focus on their strengths and weaknesses accord-
ing to the criteria which were mentioned above.
Service-oriented Migration and Reuse Technique
The Service-Oriented Migration and Reuse Technique (SMART) was developed by
the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University (Lewis et al.,
2005). SMART’s strengths lay in migrating legacy applications into a Service-
Oriented Architecture SOA. Enterprises can apply SMART to analyze their legacy
systems and to evaluate their feasibility to integrate a SOA. The analysis includes
stakeholder context, capability descriptions (as is), SOA description (to be), gap
analysis, and development of a migration strategy. SEI arguments that the approach
allows to adapt legacy systems to services without affecting the involved systems
while exposing functionality to a large number of client applications using standard-
based interfaces.
SMART lacks support for a more business-driven approach and neglects business
models and business processes. Moreover, the methodology is not intended to be
offered outside a company in a service ecosystem as a product nor does it embody
innovation or model transformation.
Service-Oriented Analysis and Design
The Service-Oriented Analysis and Design (SOAD) methodology was developed by
IBM (Zimmermann et al., 2004). SOAD results from an analysis of Object-oriented
Analysis and Design (OOAD), Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks, and Busi-
ness Process Modeling (BPM) for SOA deployment. SOAD’s strength lies in the
combination of the previous mentioned approaches. Additionally to the mentioned
approaches, SOAD offers ad hoc service composition, semantic brokering, service
discovery, quality factors, and reusability. It addresses the business operational level.
Though SOAD does not merely cover technical integration strategies, it offers no in-
