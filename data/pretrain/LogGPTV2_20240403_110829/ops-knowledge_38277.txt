User: When you need to deploy a highly available system, how to plan and design an architecture that meets business needs? Please give a basic system architecture diagram and description.
Assistant: In order to plan and design a highly available system architecture that meets business needs, the following points need to be considered: 1. Architecture design goals: high availability, high performance, high scalability, security, maintainability, etc. 2. Database design: use distributed database or master-slave database architecture to ensure high data availability and data consistency. 3. Load balancing: use load balancing to distribute requests, avoid single point of failure, and improve system availability and throughput. 4. Highly available container: container technology is used to improve the reliability and scalability of the system and ensure the high availability of the system. 5. Message queuing: Use message queuing to realize asynchronous processing and peak shaving and valley filling to ensure high availability and high performance of the system. On this basis, a basic high-availability system architecture diagram is as follows: ![High-availability system architecture diagram](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/1500441/1611467243774-25db9a87-52b8- 4e7a-807a-3cbffc4604d6.png) The architecture diagram includes the following components: 1. User access: users send requests through web browsers or mobile devices. 2. Load balancer: All requests will be sent to one or more load balancers, and the load balancer will distribute the requests to different network nodes. 3. Web server: The web server is the basic component for accepting and processing HTTP requests, and can handle static web pages, dynamic web pages, etc. 4. Distributed cache: Distributed cache is used to cache application and database data in memory to improve read and write speed and reduce pressure on the database. 5. Database: Distributed database is used to store and process data, supports features such as data partitioning and replication, and ensures high availability and consistency of data. 6. Message queue: Message queue is used to decouple different services, cut peaks and fill valleys, and support asynchronous processing. 7. Application service: Application service is responsible for processing business logic and data operations, and communicates with other services through message queues. 8. Highly available containers: Container technology is used to automate and failover infrastructure to ensure system reliability and scalability. In addition, the architecture diagram also includes some monitoring, log and alarm systems, which are used to implement system monitoring, diagnosis and troubleshooting to ensure high availability and maintainability of the system.
