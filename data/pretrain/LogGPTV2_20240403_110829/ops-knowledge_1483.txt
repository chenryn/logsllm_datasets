User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Does routing internet traffic via VPN through a company proxy gain any more security? There is currently an ongoing discussion in our company about what security measures to put in place regarding workstation access to the company network and the internet.

Situation:


Employees have Linux laptops with encrypted SSDs
on these SSDs is the intellectual property of the company
Employees have unrestricted root access to these machines
AntiVirus is installed and running


Goal:


Have protection against theft of the intellectual property of the company while still being able to work from anywhere in the world


Current idea:


Use VPN to tunnel all network traffic (including internet traffic) through the company
Do not allow direct internet access via VPN but rather enforce that a proxy server has to be used.


Question:

Does the additional proxy server for internet access provide more security than it (potentially) costs in the effort? (additional client configuration effort programs and services, ...)

Laptop &lt;-> VPN &lt;-> Proxy &lt;-> Internet   vs. Laptop &lt;-> VPN &lt;-> Internet

Brainstorming:

If the laptop is compromised (backdoor running). How does VPN protect the data anyway if the user has root access and can change network configuration (routes, iptables, ...) as he pleases. What additional security does a company proxy give?

Assistant: Does the additional proxy server for internet access provide more security than it (potentially) costs in effort ? 


If the proxy is just a dumb proxy then there is no additional protection. But usually the company proxy is actually a system which analyzes the traffic for malware or data leakage, blocks potentially malicious sites and might even do HTTPS interception to analyze encrypted traffic. In this case the proxy offers more protection than direct unfiltered internet access from the Laptop.


  ... If the laptop is compromised (backdoor running)....


That's not the main point of the proxy. The proxy is there to make infections harder in the first place. And it might also be used to detect and block typical C&amp;C communication done by malware.


  ...  if the user has root access and can change network configuration ...


If the user is granted full access to the configuration of the system there is nothing technical the company can do to stop the user from deliberately violating the company policy of using the proxy. But the company can easily check who uses the proxy by looking at the proxies logs and charge users who don't use the proxy with violating the policy.
