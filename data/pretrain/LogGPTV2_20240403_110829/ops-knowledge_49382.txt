Question: As a mobile application security expert, you are tasked with reviewing the cryptographic security of a new Android application. You must ensure that the application adheres to best practices for secure storage of sensitive information. Which of the following measures should you recommend to enhance the cryptographic security of the application?
"A": "Utilize a custom encryption algorithm to ensure uniqueness and prevent known vulnerabilities found in standard algorithms.",
"B": "Implement industry-standard encryption algorithms and manage keys using a secure key management process.",
"C": "Store all cryptographic keys in plain text within the application's source code to simplify key management.",
"D": "Avoid encryption altogether, relying on Android's built-in user authentication to provide sufficient security."
Answer: B
