User: I'm writing a python application that runs several subprocesses using subprocess.Popen objects.
I have a glade GUI and want to display the output of these commands (running in subprocess.Popen) in the gui in real time.
Can anyone suggest a way to do this? What glade object do I need to use and how to redirect the output?
Assistant: glade is only a program to build gui with gtk so when you ask for a glade object maybe you should ask for gtk widget and in this case textbuffer and textview chould be a solution or maybe treeview and liststore.
subprocess.Popen has stdout and stderr arguments that can accept a file-like object. you can create an adapter that writes to the textbuffer or add items in the liststore
