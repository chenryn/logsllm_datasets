I have been using TensorFlow's Poet Guide to train my own model and have generated the `retrained_graph.pb` and `retrained_labels.txt` files. However, when I try to use these in my application, I encounter the following error:

```
Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Op BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization is not available in GraphDef version 21. It has been removed in version 9. Use tf.nn.batch_normalization().
    at org.tensorflow.Graph.importGraphDef(Native Method)
    at org.tensorflow.Graph.importGraphDef(Graph.java:118)
```

To address this issue, I followed the TensorFlow for Mobile blog and retrained the model, generating three new files: `optimized_graph.pb`, `rounded_graph.pb`, and `mmapped_graph.pb`. The `optimized_graph.pb` and `rounded_graph.pb` files work without any errors in the Android application. However, when I attempt to use the `mmapped_graph.pb` file, I receive the following error:

```
Failed to initialize: java.io.IOException: Not a valid TensorFlow Graph serialization: Invalid GraphDef
```

Additionally, the performance of the application is suboptimal when using the `optimized_graph.pb` and `rounded_graph.pb` files. Specifically, the camera screen often displays random flower names with high confidence even when no flowers are present. Is there a way to configure the model to only detect flowers and leave the output blank when no flowers are detected?

Here is a screenshot for reference:
