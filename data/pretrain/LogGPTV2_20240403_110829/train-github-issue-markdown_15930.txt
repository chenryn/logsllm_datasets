### Apache Airflow version
2.5.1
### What happened
Create two files with DAGs  
Both DAGs must have the same ID  
Airflow will constantly update DAG structure/code resulting in dozens of weird
behaviors and errors:
  * wrong DAG visualization
  * wrong DAG code
  * errors about missing tasks from time to time
### What you think should happen instead
Airflow should show an error to the user and disable both DAGs.
### How to reproduce
  1. Create two files with DAGs
  2. Both DAGs should have the same ID
