 **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
This is a feature request for Normal-inverse-gamma distribution support at
`scipy.stats` subpackage.
I will implement and open a pull request if approved.
**Describe the solution you'd like**
Normal-inverse-gamma distribution distribution is the conjugate prior of a
Normal distribution with unknown mean and variance [1], which is is commonly
used in Bayesian statistics.
