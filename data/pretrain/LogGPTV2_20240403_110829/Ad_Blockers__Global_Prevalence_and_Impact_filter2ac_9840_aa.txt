### Abstract

Ad blockers pose a significant threat to the online advertising ecosystem. Understanding their prevalence and impact is challenging due to the scale and diversity of the ecosystem. This paper leverages unique data gathering assets to assess the global prevalence and impact of ad blockers. Our study is based on two primary data sources: (i) a 2 million person worldwide user panel providing ground truth for ad blocker installations, and (ii) telemetry from a large number of publisher web pages and ads served. We introduce a novel method using Mixture Proportion Estimation (MPE) to estimate ad blocker prevalence. Applying this method to nearly 2 trillion web transactions collected over one month (February 2016), we derive ad blocker prevalence estimates for desktop systems across various geographic areas and demographic groups. We also examine the impact of ad blockers on users and publishers, reporting on the reduction in ads shown to users with ad blockers installed and the continued exposure to a significant number of ads. Additionally, we characterize the impact of ad blockers across different categories of publisher sites, including those participating in whitelisting.

### 1. Introduction

An ad blocker is a tool that prevents ads from being delivered to a user's browser. The stated intent of ad blocker developers is to enable users to surf the web without annoying ads. While the definition of "annoying" is subjective, it is clear that these tools pose a significant threat to the digital media ecosystem, which has been funded by online advertisements.

Ad blockers are typically implemented as plugins or browser extensions that intercept and eliminate outgoing ad requests from a base web page. They use various mechanisms, such as comparing URLs in embedded requests to blacklists of ad server URLs. If a match is found, the blocker prevents the request from being transmitted. Some popular ad blockers are open source and free to users, but authors are now monetizing their efforts by offering to whitelist certain advertisers and publishers [9].

Despite being available for over a decade, ad blockers have recently gained significant attention in the media. This study aims to answer several key questions: What is the prevalence of ad blocker installations on the internet? How do ad blockers behave when installed? What is their impact on publishers? Addressing these questions will help clarify the broader conversation about ad blockers and inform the digital media ecosystem on how it can evolve.

There are two main challenges in addressing these questions: assembling datasets on browser configurations and ensuring unbiased population samples. In this paper, we report the results of our study on the prevalence and impact of ad blockers. Our analysis is based on unique data assets, including nearly 2 trillion web transactions and a 2 million person user panel, which provide comprehensive insights beyond standard reports on blocker downloads.

### 2. Data

This section provides an overview of the two primary data sources used in this study.

#### 2.1. User Panel

The comScore panel consists of 2 million users worldwide who voluntarily install monitoring software in exchange for various benefits, such as cloud storage, antivirus software, and cash prizes. The panel collects data on web browsing behavior and internet use. When a panelist registers, they provide their geographic location and demographic information, including age, sex, and household income.

The panel monitoring software can observe software installations on panelists' computers, enabling the enumeration of web browser configurations, including the presence of ad-blocking software. We use search queries to build a list of popular ad blockers for three major browsers (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox). The current lists include 10 ad blockers for Internet Explorer, 20 for Google Chrome, and 15 for Mozilla Firefox. While these lists may not be exhaustive, they include most widely reported blockers.

We refer to the subset of panel users with an ad blocker installed as the "panel percent ad block." As with any widely recruited panel, bias can be introduced if certain populations find the incentivized recruitment more attractive. Our intuition is that individuals who voluntarily install panel software may be less concerned with privacy, a trait that could correlate with ad blocker installation. We correct this bias using the broader census data via MPE.

#### 2.2. Census Data

The comScore census network is one of the most widely deployed internet census networks, collecting daily information on over 20 billion page views across half a million top-level domains and over 2 billion ad deliveries. This data is collected via JavaScript tags deployed on publisher pages and advertisements. The information includes a cookie identifier, a timestamp, and the type of tag (e.g., page or ad).

To estimate the prevalence of ad blocker usage, we count page and ad tags associated with individual cookies over a month. For each cookie, we tally the number of page views and ad deliveries. Cookies with fewer than 200 page views or that have not existed on the census network for at least 30 days are excluded.

The remaining cookies are categorized into three disjoint populations: (i) labeled cookies associated with ad-blocking software (Sblock), (ii) labeled cookies known not to be associated with ad-blocking software (Sads), and (iii) unlabeled cookies (S).

#### 2.3. Ad Ratio Statistic

The ad ratio statistic, defined as the number of ads delivered divided by the number of page views, is computed on a cookie-by-cookie basis:

\[ \text{ad ratio} = \frac{\text{count of ad deliveries}}{\text{count of pageviews}} \]

This statistic is closely tied to ad blocker usage, as it estimates the number of ads delivered per unit of internet browsing. However, it alone is insufficient to infer whether a user has an ad blocker installed. Users may browse pages without ads, or users with an ad blocker may still see some ads due to disabling or whitelisting.

The inherent restrictions of the data give rise to two challenges: (i) the panel is biased away from ad blocker usage, and (ii) census data is insufficient to reliably classify individual cookies. We address these challenges using the MPE approach described below.

#### 2.4. Cookies and Users

There are important nuances in defining an ad block user and the relationship between users and cookies. The panel indicates the presence of ad-blocking software at some point during the reporting period but does not imply continuous use. A user may install and disable ad-blocking software, or disable it on specific sites, yet still be considered an ad block user.

**Definition - Ad block user:** A person with one or more ad-blocking programs installed on their primary computer at some point during the reporting period.

When studying ad block prevalence in the census network, ad blocking is associated directly with browser cookies, not users. In this study, there is nearly a one-to-one correspondence between a user and a cookie, with an estimated 1.03 cookies per person, close enough to 1 to be omitted.

### 3. Mixture Proportion Estimation (MPE)

Mixture proportion estimation (MPE) is a technique for finding the proportions of classes in unlabeled datasets. [8]
