ABSTRACT
Ad blockers are a formidable threat to the vitality of the on-
line advertising eco-system. Understanding their prevalence
and impact is challenging due to the massive scale and di-
versity of the eco-system. In this paper, we utilize unique
data gathering assets to assess the prevalence and impact of
ad blockers from an Internet-wide perspective. Our study is
based on (i) a 2 million person world-wide user panel that
provides ground truth for ad blocker installations and (ii)
telemetry from large number of publisher web pages and ads
served to publishers. We describe a novel method for assess-
ing the prevalence of ad blocker installations that is based
on Mixture Proportion Estimation. We apply this method to
nearly 2 trillion web transactions collected over the period of
1 month (February 2016), to derive ad blocker prevalence es-
timates for desktop systems in diverse geographic areas and
for diverse demographic groups. Next, using deployment es-
timates we consider the impact of ad blockers on users and
on publisher sites. Speciﬁcally, we report on the reduction of
ads shown to users with ad blockers installed and show that
even though a user may have an ad blocker installed, they are
still exposed to a signiﬁcant number of ads. We also char-
acterize the impact of ad blockers across different categories
of publisher sites including those that may be participating
in whitelisting [9].

INTRODUCTION
An ad blocker, as the name suggests, offers the capability
to prevent ads from being delivered to a user’s browser. The
stated intent of entities that have developed ad blockers is to
enable users to surf the web without annoying ads. While
the deﬁnition of “annoying" is somewhat unclear, what is
clear is that these capabilities pose a signiﬁcant threat to the

digital media ecosystem, which has delivered a wide range
of transformative services that have been funded by online
ads.
Ad blockers are typically implemented as plugins or browser
extensions that when installed, attempt to intercept and elim-
inate outgoing ad requests from a base web page 1. They use
a variety of mechanisms to identify ad requests. One of the
most common and effective mechanisms is to compare the
URLs in the embedded requests to a blacklist(s) of URLs
of ad servers and advertising platforms. If there is a match,
the blocker will prevent the request from being transmitted.
While a number of the most popular ad blockers are open
source and free to users, authors of these systems are now
monetizing their efforts by offering to whitelist certain ad-
vertisers and publishers [9].
While ad blockers have been available for over a decade,
they have been receiving signiﬁcant attention in the popu-
lar media over the past year. Given this attention, we seek
answers to several simple questions: what is the prevalence
of ad blocker installs in the internet? what is the behavior
of ad blockers when installed? and what is the impact to
publishers? Answers to these questions will help to clarify
the broader conversation about ad blockers and inform the
digital media ecosystem about how it can evolve.
There are two signiﬁcant challenges in addressing ques-
tions that focus on internet-wide population estimation. First,
it is difﬁcult to assemble data sets on browser conﬁgurations
that enable such estimates. Second, since it is impossible to
have ground truth for all browser conﬁgurations deployed on
all user systems, estimates based on a smaller population of
users is required. Care must be taken in any such estimate to
remove bias from the sample population.
In this paper we report results of our study of the preva-
lence and impact of ad blockers in the internet. Our anal-
yses is based on unique data assets that enable us to as-
sess ad blocker deployment and impact in a comprehensive
fashion that goes well beyond standard reports on blocker
downloads (e.g., Ad Block Plus [5]). The data assets include
census information from nearly 2 trillion web transactions
collected over a period of a month. This is complemented
by data collected over the same period of time from a 2M
person user panel (distributed across the internet) that ex-

blockers are also available for mobile apps.
poses all details of browser conﬁgurations. This panel data,
with ground truth information about ad blocker installs, is
the starting point for our study.
We posit that users who opt-in to participate in a world-
wide user panel that is speciﬁcally designed to track web
browsing and ad consumption are less likely to install and
enable an ad blocker. We develop a novel technique based
on Mixture Proportion Estimation (MPE) to quantify this ef-
fect. In particular, MPE enables the proportions of subpopu-
lations in a mixture to be estimated from samples. Our tech-
nique is based on the assumption that users with ad blockers
will see fewer ads than those without ad blockers. We be-
gin by separating panelists into two groups – those with and
those without ad blockers – and then quantify the ad display
rates for those groups. The ad display rates allow us to infer
the prevalence of ad blocking in the census data. Theoret-
ical guarantees in the form of conﬁdence ranges and statis-
tical signiﬁcance levels are provided. The MPE technique
employed in this paper enables, to the best of our knowl-
edge, the largest scale assessment of ad blocker deployment
to date.
2. DATA
In this section we provide an overview of the two sources
of data used in this study.
Panel. The comScore panel consists of 2 million users
worldwide who voluntarily install monitoring software in
exchange for various beneﬁts, including cloud storage, anti-
virus software, tree planting, and other cash prizes 2. The
panel provides measurements on panelist’s web browsing
behavior and internet use. When a panelist registers, they
voluntary provide their geographic location and demographic
information including age, sex, household income, etc.
The panel monitoring software is also able to observe in-
stallations of software on panelist’s computer. This enables
enumeration of web browser conﬁgurations including whether
or not ad block software packages are installed. We do this
by using search queries to build a list of popular ad block-
ers (e.g., Ad Block Plus, Ad Block, etc.)
for three ma-
jor browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and
Mozilla Firefox) and then search for these names in the con-
ﬁguration data. The current lists include 10 ad blockers for
Internet Explorer, 20 ad blockers for Google Chrome, and 15
ad blockers for Mozilla Firefox. While we make no claims
that each list is complete, we argue that each include most
if not all of the widely reported blockers (which we quantify
in Section 4). We refer to the subset of panel users that have
an ad blocker installed as the panel percent ad block.
As with any widely recruited panel, bias can be intro-
duced when some populations ﬁnd the incentivized recruit-
ment more attractive than others. This is true of the com-
Score panel and the populations of internet users that do/don’t
use ad block software. Our intuition is that an individual who
voluntarily installs panel software on their machine is likely

to be less concerned with privacy – a trait that could correlate
with ad block installation. As we show, the panel is indeed
biased away from ad block usage. One of the key aspects
of our work is correcting this bias using the broader census
via MPE. For the purposes of estimating ad block usage in
the general internet population, the panel provides a data set
consisting of tuples of (i) a comScore browser cookie and (ii)
a binary label indicating the presence or absence of ad block-
ing software. Details of the MPE approach are provided in
Section 3.
Census. The comScore census network is one of the most
widely deployed internet census networks in the world. The
census network collects information daily on over 20 billion
page views across half a million top level domains. In ad-
dition, the census network collects data on over 2 billion ad
deliveries daily. This data is collected via JavaScript tags de-
ployed on publisher pages and JavaScript tags deployed with
advertisements. In both settings, a client machine executes
the tag locally and reports information directly to our data
warehouse. The information includes a cookie identiﬁer, a
timestamp, and the type of tag (e.g., page or ad).
Estimation of the prevalence of ad block usage across the
census network relies on counts of page and ad tags associ-
ated with individual cookies over the course of a month. In
particular, for each cookie present on the census network, the
count of page views and the count of ad deliveries is tallied
over the reporting period. The data gathered from the cen-
sus network are tuples consisting of (i) a comScore browser
cookie (ii) the count of tagged ads delivered to that browser
cookie and (iii) the count of tagged page views delivered
to that browser cookie. The data set under consideration is
reduced to ensure a longitudinal view of each cookie; specif-
ically, a cookie is excluded from the study if (i) it has fewer
than 200 pageviews or (ii) has not existed on the census net-
work for a minimum of 30 days.
Of the remaining cookies, a subset correspond to com-
Score panelists. This subset of cookies can be labeled as
associated or not associated with ad block software by com-
paring against the panel data set described above. Ultimately
this deﬁnes three disjoint populations of cookies: (i) the set
of labeled cookies associated with ad block software, de-
noted Sblock, (ii) the set of labeled cookies known to not be
associated with ad block software, denoted Sads, and (iii) the
set unlabeled cookies, denoted S.
Ad Ratio Statistic. The ad ratio statistic, deﬁned as the
number of ads delivered divided by the number of page views,
is computed on a cookie by cookie basis:
ad ratio =
count of ad deliveries
count of pageviews
(1)
This statistic, in aggregate, is closely tied to ad block usage
since it acts as an estimate of the number of ads delivered to
a user per unit of internet browsing. However, this statistic
alone is not sufﬁcient to infer if a user has or does not have an
ad blocker installed. First, in some cases users may browse
pages that do not deliver ads, and will have an ad statistic
equal to zero regardless of whether or not they have ad block
installed. Second, it is often the case that users with an ad
blocker installed, either through disabling of the ad blocker
or whitelisting of ads [9], are shown some number of ads and
possibly many ads.
Ultimately the inherent restrictions of the data on hand
gives rise to two challenges: (i) the panel is biased away
from ad block usage and (ii) census data is insufﬁcient to re-
liably classify individual cookies as associated with ad block-
ing software. We address both of these challenges via the
MPE approach described below.
Cookies and Users. There are a number of important de-
tails and nuances pertaining to the precise deﬁnition of an
ad block user, and the relationship between users and cook-
ies. While the panel allows association of a user with ad
blocking software, it does not imply that the user actually
employed ad blocking software for the entire reporting pe-
riod. Instead, it simply indicates the presence of ad block-
ing software at some point during the reporting period. A
user may install ad block software and immediately disable
it entirely or more commonly install ad block software and
disable it on a subset of sites; in both cases the user would
still be considered an ad block user.
Deﬁnition - Ad block user: a person with one or more ad
blocking programs installed on their primary computer at
some point during the reporting period.
Second, when studying ad block prevalence in the cen-
sus network, ad blocking is associated directly with browser
cookies, not users.
In this study, there is nearly a one to
one correspondence between a user and a cookie. Using the
subset of cookies associated with the panel, the estimated
number of cookies per person was 1.03, sufﬁciently close to
1 to be omitted.
