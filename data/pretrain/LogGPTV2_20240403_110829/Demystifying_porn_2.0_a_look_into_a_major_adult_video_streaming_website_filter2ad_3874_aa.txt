ABSTRACT
The Internet has evolved into a huge video delivery infrastructure,
with websites such as YouTube and Netﬂix appearing at the top
of most trafﬁc measurement studies. However, most trafﬁc studies
have largely kept silent about an area of the Internet that (even to-
day) is poorly understood: adult media distribution. Whereas ten
years ago, such services were provided primarily via peer-to-peer
ﬁle sharing and bespoke websites, recently these have converged
towards what is known as “Porn 2.0”. These popular web portals
allow users to upload, view, rate and comment videos for free. De-
spite this, we still lack even a basic understanding of how users
interact with these services. This paper seeks to address this gap
by performing the ﬁrst large-scale measurement study of one of
the most popular Porn 2.0 websites: YouPorn. We have repeatedly
crawled the website to collect statistics about 183k videos, witness-
ing over 60 billion views. Through this, we offer the ﬁrst character-
isation of this type of corpus, highlighting the nature of YouPorn’s
repository. We also inspect the popularity of objects and how they
relate to other features such as the categories to which they belong.
We ﬁnd evidence for a high level of ﬂexibility in the interests of its
user base, manifested in the extremely rapid decay of content pop-
ularity over time, as well as high susceptibility to browsing order.
Using a small-scale user study, we validate some of our ﬁndings
and explore the infrastructure design and management implications
of our observations.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet has evolved from a largely web-oriented infrastruc-
ture to a massively distributed content delivery system [27]. Video
content is particularly popular: by 2016, 86% of all Internet trafﬁc
is predicted to be video [5]. This transformation has led to a mul-
titude of research attempts to characterise key video portals and
the corresponding changing consumption patterns. This includes
seminal studies into user-generated content (UGC) [13], video on
demand (VoD) [40], Internet TV (IPTV) [14] and catch-up TV [6,
29]. Thanks to them, our knowledge has been expanded and, in
many cases, the infrastructures improved.
However, there is an elephant in the room: adult video distribu-
tion. Similar to other kinds of content, adult video consumption
has been undergoing dramatic shifts. Traditionally, adult videos
were distributed via pay-per-view websites and within peer-to-peer
communities (e.g., one estimate found that pornography constitutes
up to 18% of the ﬁles on eDonkey in some regions [35]). Re-
cently, however, increasing amounts of trafﬁc are being generated
by emerging YouTube-like websites that provide free on-demand
access to adult videos. These sites term themselves “Porn 2.0”, and
give users the ability to upload, view, rank and comment on videos,
as well as form online proﬁles.
Next to nothing is known about the nature of Porn 2.0, nor the
way users interact with it; little is even known (outside ISPs) about
the actual amount of trafﬁc generated by these sites. Despite this,
its prominence in the Alexa rankings [1] is undeniable, with six
adult websites listed in the top 100, more than any other genre
of video streaming. We conﬁrm the huge scale of adult content
in this paper, where we ﬁnd over 111 million requests to a single
adult website in just a three day period. Considering this scale and
prominence, we believe it crucial to gain a better understanding
of the characteristics of Porn 2.0, and derive principles that could
mitigate its impact on the network.
In this paper, we inspect one of the most popular Porn 2.0 web-
sites: YouPorn [2]. Founded in 2006, it has quickly risen to global
prominence. For the last 5 years, it has been amongst the most
highly ranked sites listed in Alexa, consistently appearing in the
top 100. Due to its large scale, YouPorn provides an ideal case
study of the Internet’s expanding adult video market.
We repeatedly crawled the YouPorn website to extract informa-
tion about the videos being created and watched. The entire corpus
consists of 183k videos, consisting of footage spanning in excess
of 3 years. Over their lifetime, these videos collected more than 60
billion views, conﬁrming YouPorn’s huge popularity. In the last 7
days of the traces alone, 912 new videos were added and viewed
over 38 million times.
Using this data, we characterise the corpus, highlighting how
users interact with various aspects of the system. Further, we make
a number of observations that provide evidence of its speciﬁc prop-
erties compared to other types of media. Because our data does not
provide information about users’ personal intentions, we further
augment our data with a small scale user study (46 participants) to
reﬂect upon the reasons behind our ﬁndings.
One running theme in many of our ﬁndings is that despite being
consciously constructed as an adult site comparable to YouTube,
YouPorn differs from traditional UGC sites (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo)
in two key ways. First, the number of user-driven content uploads
on YouPorn is comparatively low. Indeed, YouPorn itself has up-
loaded 36% of the overall corpus. Second, despite the lower num-
ber of videos, each video gets many more views, on average, than
more mainstream UGC sites. This smaller, more popular content
corpus suggests lower operating costs for such websites.
Another theme is that users appear to be ﬂexible about which
videos they consume. Whilst we verify this independently using a
small scale user study, our dataset reveals that this user ﬂexibility
manifests itself in two unexpected ways, both of which point to the
importance of helping users to locate content. First, although adult
video content is not expected to age with time, unlike temporally-
sensitive genres such as news or weather, most of the views are gar-
nered in the ﬁrst days after upload. We demonstrate that browsing
order is a strong factor that affects the number of views obtained:
easy to ﬁnd videos collect most views. Second, we ﬁnd that the
number of categories a video appears in strongly correlates with
the number of views it obtains. Videos which are not categorised
suffer severely. We also discover that no attempt is made by You-
Porn at engineering the content of individual categories: in many
cases, highly populated categories have too few videos.
A list of contributions and paper roadmap follows:
1. We offer, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst large-scale
measurement study into so-called “Porn 2.0” adult video dis-
tribution on the Internet. We present our dataset in Section 3
consisting of over 60 billion views. We will make the data
publicly available.
2. We provide a detailed analysis of key characteristics of adult
video content (Section 4), as well as the way in which users
interact with this type of corpus and its various categories
(Sections 5 and 6).
3. We explore the reasons behind our ﬁndings through discus-
sions fuelled by a user study (Section 7). Using this, we
explore potential improvements that would beneﬁt both net-
work operators and content providers.
2. RELATED WORK
Pornography is anecdotally the most searched for content on the
Internet. Many theories exist to explain this. Cooper [16] attributes
this to the Internet’s “triple-A-engine”: Accessibility, Affordabil-
ity, Anonymity. Suler [36] expands this into 6 factors, coined as
the online disinhibition effect. Whereas, much work has gone into
looking at who engages in online sexual activities and why they
do so [12, 20], little is known about about the actual engines that
underpin its distribution, especially the expanding Porn 2.0 phe-
nomenon. This has seen websites emerging (e.g., YouPorn [2]) that
allow users to upload, view, rate and comment on videos for free,
much like YouTube does.

Table 1: Overview of datasets.
A few studies have provided estimates of the demand handled
by these websites. For example, Ogas and Gaddam [30] mention
that Porn 2.0 sites such as Pornhub, RedTube, xHamster and You-
Porn can gain up to 16 million views per month. This is a very
conservative estimate compared to YouPorn’s report of 100 million
page views a day [3]. Other estimates have suggested that sites
like YouPorn have a peak trafﬁc rate of 800 Gbps [7]. Despite all
this evidence, we still have quite a rudimentary understanding of
the true scale of these services. Regardless, most experts agree that
Porn 2.0 is a huge emerging economy that is not, as of yet, fully
understood [17, 9, 21, 39, 30].
With this in mind, it is surprising to ﬁnd next to nothing re-
ported on the (systems-level) nature and operation of online adult
multimedia delivery services. Instead, various research communi-
ties have focussed on speciﬁc sub-components such as automated
recognition and classiﬁcation [28, 25]; pornographic practices, com-
munities and subcultures [9]; interest recommendations [34]; se-
curity issues [39]; and illegal content dissemination [26]. To our
knowledge, this paper presents the ﬁrst large-scale systems-perspective
study of an online adult multimedia delivery service. We believe
this work to be crucial, considering the increasing prominence of
video distribution [5], of which adult media will likely continue to
make up a signiﬁcant proportion in the future [35]. That said, there
are a multitude of studies into more traditional video streaming sys-
tems that already provide some insight. These include catch-up TV
[6, 29], user generated content [13, 41], VoD [40] and IPTV [14,
22, 24]. Studies such as these have provided a range of insights,
including content popularity models [23], optimised caching tech-
niques [6] and improved delivery schemes [8]. As of yet, however,
we are unaware as to how these principles apply to adult media
systems. The rest of this paper therefore explores this topic.
Note that we do not make a sociological statement within our
work; nor do we espouse the proliferation of pornographic media.
We are interested in such media’s impact on the network and, as
such, we believe it is important to gain a better understanding of its
characteristics.
3. YOUPORN DATASET
We crawled the YouPorn website to obtain information about its
corpus and user base. Each video offered is accompanied by meta-
data that we extract. This metadata includes the number of views,
the video rating, the number of ratings received, the upload date,
the user who uploaded the video, the number of comments, and any
categorical information. To collect this information, we performed
a number of separate crawls, embodied within three datasets, sum-
marised in Table 1.
Our ﬁrst dataset, which we term the snapshot trace, contains in-
formation about all videos in the corpus (183, 639), collected on
the 28/02/2013. We observe over 60 billion views of videos with
durations collectively spanning in excess of 3 years. To augment
this, we also collected a second dataset, which we term the 3 day
trace. To obtain it, we re-crawled the same videos 3 days later
(3/03/2013). It contained 183,591 videos, 48 having been removed.
Using the 3 day trace, we calculated the evolution of all quantitative
metadata including popularity.
The mentioned traces provide two “snapshots” of all videos on
YouPorn. This, however, does not give much insight into the tem-
poral properties of individual videos. We have therefore also per-
formed smaller-scale periodic crawlings to collect a time series of
snapshots. The third dataset, which we term daily, traced 2172
videos added between the period of 1/03/2013 – 4/05/2013. For
each video added, we retrieved all metadata on a daily basis to
study how it evolved, offering insights into the lifetime of each
video. From the full set, we ﬁltered the entries to leave only com-
plete videos in which we had in excess of 21 days recorded. This
left 1656 videos with an accumulated set of 96 million views.
4. CHARACTERISING CONTENT CORPUS
In this section, we investigate the content corpus offered by You-
Porn. We traced 183, 639 videos within the corpus dating from
September 2006. This constitutes their entire video repository, as
available at the time of writing.
4.1 Content duration
First, we inspect the duration of videos within YouPorn, pre-
sented as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) in Figure 1.1
We observe from Figure 1 that most videos are rather short. About
80% are shorter than 15 minutes, with a very small fraction of them
exceeding 45 minutes. If we divide them into 1 minute time ranges,
the largest bucket is the 5–6 minutes, which contains 25% of all
videos. This propensity could have emerged for a number of rea-
sons. An obvious one is the presence of commercial videos that are
intended to advertise content from other (e.g., pay-based) websites.
Such users tend to upload short previews of longer videos in an at-
tempt to entice users to their websites. YouPorn allows banners to
be placed below videos to better enable this. It also appears that
many other videos only contain relatively short scenes, without the
sorts of preambles seen in other media types. Practically speaking,
the corpus therefore appears very much like a convenient “pick and
mix” repository where users can select snippets of videos that suit
their interests rather than watching entire ﬁlms. Whereas the rea-
