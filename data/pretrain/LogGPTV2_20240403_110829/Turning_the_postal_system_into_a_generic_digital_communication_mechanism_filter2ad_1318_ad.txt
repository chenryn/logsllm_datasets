does not overburden either of them. The goal of a more dynamic
approach is to allow for such routing ﬂexibilities without causing
problems such as too many disks being handled by any one node
on any given day. This is, again, a routing optimization problem
unique to the Postmanet. This dynamic routing problem is made
easier by the fact that we may potentially use the LLLB Internet
to exchange trafﬁc and routing information among the Postmanet
nodes. At the same time, this problem is made more difﬁcult by the
long latencies of the postal system: for example, when a disk is sent
on Monday from A to B and is expected to arrive on Thursday, it
may be difﬁcult to accurately predict on Monday how many disks
B would receive on Thursday.
One could also construct a Postmanet where the peer-to-peer
routing infrastructure is augmented with distributed centers in order
to enhance robustness and performance. Distribution centers, with
their ability to provide two-hop connectivity between any pair of
nodes, could be used to either service only some high-priority mes-
sages, possibly generated by paying customers who require pre-
dictable quality of service, or improve the latency of all messages
by providing short-cuts in the routing infrastructure. The routing
problem, in either case, is to compute a set of source nodes and
a possibly overlapping set of destination nodes for which a given
distribution center would serve as a hub on a given day in order to
maximize the progress of the messages in the system. A distribu-
tion center would not be statically bound to a ﬁxed set of nodes,
thereby allowing it to adapt to varying trafﬁc conditions.
Another strategy that we may consider is to replicate data and
send them down multiple postal routes simultaneously. Such copies
can be had for free (in terms of postage and other costs) if these
multiple routes would have been used anyhow even in absence of
the replication strategy. Not only may this strategy improve latency
and reliability, it can also increase routing ﬂexibility as some repli-
cas can be freely discarded in the middle of some routes. We may
use the LLLB Internet to “shoot down” extra replicas, for example,
when one of the copies reaches the destination, or more generally,
when it becomes obvious that the further forwarding of these ex-
tra replicas would result in sub-optimal behavior. We have seen the
themes of exploiting the LLLB Internet and exploiting the abundant
storage capacity/bandwidth in the application and end point man-
agement sections (Sections 2 and 3); we now see the same themes
recurring in the routing section.
While not technically falling under the title of “dynamic rout-
ing,” another possible use of the Postmanet is to compose an end-
to-end communication path with a sequential concatenation of In-
ternet and Postmanet hops. For example, an isolated village may
communicate with the rest of the world using a Postmanet hop,
while the hops inside the village and the hops in the rest of the
world are conventional network hops.
5. RELATED WORK
Gray and his colleagues have shipped via the postal system en-
tire NFS servers ﬁlled with terabytes of astronomy data [8]. NFS
servers are chosen as mobile storage devices to minimize the amount
of manual conﬁguration a data recipient would need to perform.
This is a goal that we share. Our interest is in generalizing these
tailor-made solutions for specialized applications into a generic com-
munication mechanism that can beneﬁt many applications. A local
ﬁle system interface that grants application access to the mobile
storage devices may be inadequate: for example, tasks such as re-
cipients’ sending back acknowledgements over the Internet should
be automated away by a transport-level system. We also note that
the applicability of the Postmanet approach is by no means limited
to data-intensive scientiﬁc applications: we have discussed a vari-
ety of applications that can be useful for average users, especially
those who fall on the wrong side of the digital divide.
Rover is a toolkit for constructing applications targeting weak
and intermittent wireless networks [11]. A key element of the sys-
tem is an asynchronous communication mechanism that allows ap-
plications running on mobile wireless clients to continue to func-
tion as communication with a remote server occurs in the back-
ground. The need of an asynchronous communication mechanism
applies to the high-latency Postmanet. The characteristics of the
postal system, however, are different from those of a weak wireless
network: the postal system provides a high-latency high-bandwidth
datagram-like service. By simultaneously exploiting an available
low-latency low-bandwidth Internet connection and the excess ca-
pacity of movable storage media, we can provide better higher-level
services.
Recent efforts on “Delay-Tolerant Networks” (DTNs) [7, 9, 12,
20] have started to examine the use of WiFi-enabled mobile ele-
ments (such as buses equipped with storage devices) to simulate
“delayed” connectivity to places that have access to none today.
While “postal classes of service” have been mentioned, to the best
of our knowledge, the postal system has so far only been mentioned
as an analogy—no existing DTN that we are aware of literally uses
the postal system. There are several important differences between
existing DTNs and the Postmanet. First, while existing DTNs are
largely conﬁned to relatively small regions or specialized environ-
ments, the postal system is a truly global “network” that reaches
a far greater percentage of the world’s human population with-
out needing investment in exotic equipment. Ad hoc routing, fre-
quently a central focus of some DTNs, is not necessarily a top focus
of the Postmanet. Instead, we are more concerned with somewhat
less conventional routing metrics, such as the number of storage
devices handled per site per postman visit.
Second, most existing DTNs are also frequently referred to as
“challenged networks:” they may be limited by low bandwidth
among mobile ad hoc elements, brief and/or intermittent contacts
among these elements, small amounts of storage space on these
nodes, and power consumption constraints. In contrast, the mobile
storage devices in the Postmanet are “dumb” and “dormant” dur-
ing transit in the postal system. When they reach their destinations,
they are “plugged in,” quite possibly with high-bandwidth wired al-
ternatives (such as USB2 or Firewire). Once such “contacts” are es-
tablished, they may remain connected for extended periods of time.
Instead of carefully conserving resources such as storage space and
bandwidth, we may in fact strive to “waste” some of these abun-
dant resources in order to gain other advantages. Another unique
aspect of the Postmanet is the possible availability of a comple-
mentary low-latency low-bandwidth Internet connection: the tech-
niques involved in the parallel exploitation of multiple connectivity
technologies are different from those involved in the sequential for-
warding of data from one connectivity technology to another.
The PersonalRAID system leverages a single mobile storage de-
vice that always accompanies its owner to transport storage system
differences across multiple computers for a single user [21].
In
some existing mobile storage systems (such as Coda [14, 18] and
Bayou [19, 22]), mobile devices can work with partially consis-
tent data in a disconnected environment and synchronize with either
servers or peers at occasional and discrete synchronization points
when connectivity becomes available. The goal of these distributed
mobile storage systems is to provide the illusion of a coherent disk
or ﬁle system, while the goal of the Postmanet is to provide the illu-
sion of a network connection—these are very different abstractions.
The network abstraction is at a sufﬁciently low level that may allow
potentially greater degree of application ﬂexibility, while an impor-
tant goal of typical distributed storage systems is to entirely abstract
away device or machine identities. The question of how to build a
distributed storage system on top of the Postmanet, however, is still
an interesting one.

6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have described how to turn storage media trans-
ported by the postal system into a generic high-bandwidth digital
communication mechanism. The simultaneous exploitation of an
available low-latency low-bandwidth Internet connection and the
excess storage capacity allows us to improve the latency, cost and
reliability of higher-level services. We have also described a range
of routing alternatives that provide different tradeoffs of metrics
that are unique to the Postmanet system. We believe the Postmanet
can enable a variety of interesting bandwidth-intensive applica-
tions; and it presents an unconventional but promising approach
to addressing the digital divide.
