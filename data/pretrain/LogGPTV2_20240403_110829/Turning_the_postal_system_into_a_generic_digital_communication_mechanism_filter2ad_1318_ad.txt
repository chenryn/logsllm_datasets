### Optimized Text

The goal of a dynamic routing approach is to enable flexible routing without overburdening any single node, such as by handling too many disks on any given day. This is a unique routing optimization problem specific to the Postmanet. The dynamic routing challenge is simplified by the potential use of the LLLB Internet for exchanging traffic and routing information among Postmanet nodes. However, it is complicated by the long latencies inherent in the postal system. For example, if a disk is sent from Node A to Node B on Monday and is expected to arrive on Thursday, predicting the number of disks Node B will receive on Thursday can be difficult.

To enhance robustness and performance, the peer-to-peer routing infrastructure of the Postmanet could be augmented with distributed centers. These centers, which provide two-hop connectivity between any pair of nodes, can either service high-priority messages (e.g., from paying customers requiring predictable quality of service) or improve the latency of all messages by providing shortcuts in the routing infrastructure. The routing problem, in both cases, involves computing a set of source nodes and a possibly overlapping set of destination nodes for which a given distribution center would serve as a hub on a given day, maximizing the progress of messages in the system. Distribution centers should not be statically bound to a fixed set of nodes, allowing them to adapt to varying traffic conditions.

Another strategy to consider is data replication, where multiple copies of data are sent down different postal routes simultaneously. If these multiple routes would have been used anyway, this strategy incurs no additional costs. Not only can this improve latency and reliability, but it also increases routing flexibility, as some replicas can be discarded mid-route if they become unnecessary. The LLLB Internet can be used to "shoot down" extra replicas, for example, when one copy reaches its destination or when further forwarding would be suboptimal. This theme of leveraging the LLLB Internet and abundant storage capacity/bandwidth recurs throughout the application and end-point management sections (Sections 2 and 3) and now in the routing section.

While not strictly under the category of "dynamic routing," another possible use of the Postmanet is to create an end-to-end communication path that combines Internet and Postmanet hops. For instance, an isolated village might communicate with the rest of the world using a Postmanet hop, while the hops within the village and the rest of the world are conventional network hops.

Gray and his colleagues have used the postal system to ship entire NFS servers filled with terabytes of astronomy data [8]. NFS servers are chosen as mobile storage devices to minimize the manual configuration required by the data recipient, a goal we share. Our interest lies in generalizing these specialized solutions into a generic communication mechanism that benefits a wide range of applications. A local file system interface for accessing mobile storage devices may be inadequate, as tasks like sending acknowledgments over the Internet should be automated at the transport level. The Postmanet approach is not limited to data-intensive scientific applications; it can be useful for average users, especially those on the wrong side of the digital divide.

Rover is a toolkit for constructing applications targeting weak and intermittent wireless networks [11]. It includes an asynchronous communication mechanism that allows applications running on mobile wireless clients to function even as communication with a remote server occurs in the background. This need for asynchronous communication applies to the high-latency Postmanet, though the characteristics of the postal system differ from those of a weak wireless network. The postal system provides a high-latency, high-bandwidth datagram-like service. By exploiting an available low-latency, low-bandwidth Internet connection and the excess capacity of movable storage media, we can provide better higher-level services.

Recent efforts on "Delay-Tolerant Networks" (DTNs) [7, 9, 12, 20] have explored using WiFi-enabled mobile elements (e.g., buses with storage devices) to simulate delayed connectivity in areas with no current access. While "postal classes of service" have been mentioned, the postal system has so far only been used as an analogy. There are several key differences between existing DTNs and the Postmanet. First, existing DTNs are often confined to small regions or specialized environments, whereas the postal system is a global network reaching a larger percentage of the world's population without the need for exotic equipment. Ad hoc routing, a focus in some DTNs, is not a top priority for the Postmanet. Instead, we focus on less conventional routing metrics, such as the number of storage devices handled per site per postman visit.

Second, most existing DTNs are referred to as "challenged networks" due to limitations in bandwidth, brief and/or intermittent contacts, and power constraints. In contrast, the mobile storage devices in the Postmanet are "dumb" and "dormant" during transit. Upon arrival, they can be connected via high-bandwidth wired alternatives (e.g., USB2 or Firewire) and remain connected for extended periods. Instead of conserving resources, we may leverage abundant resources to gain other advantages. Another unique aspect of the Postmanet is the availability of a complementary low-latency, low-bandwidth Internet connection, enabling the parallel exploitation of multiple connectivity technologies.

The PersonalRAID system uses a single mobile storage device that always accompanies its owner to transport storage system differences across multiple computers for a single user [21]. Some existing mobile storage systems (e.g., Coda [14, 18] and Bayou [19, 22]) allow mobile devices to work with partially consistent data in a disconnected environment and synchronize with servers or peers at discrete points. The goal of these distributed mobile storage systems is to provide the illusion of a coherent disk or file system, while the Postmanet aims to provide the illusion of a network connection. The network abstraction offers greater application flexibility, while typical distributed storage systems abstract away device or machine identities. Building a distributed storage system on top of the Postmanet remains an interesting challenge.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we have described how to transform storage media transported by the postal system into a generic high-bandwidth digital communication mechanism. By simultaneously leveraging an available low-latency, low-bandwidth Internet connection and the excess storage capacity, we can improve the latency, cost, and reliability of higher-level services. We have also outlined various routing alternatives that offer different trade-offs unique to the Postmanet system. We believe the Postmanet can enable a variety of bandwidth-intensive applications and presents an unconventional but promising approach to addressing the digital divide.
