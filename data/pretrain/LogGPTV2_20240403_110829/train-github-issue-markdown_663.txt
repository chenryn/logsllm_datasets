Example:
    use std::collections::HashSet;
    fn main() {
        let mut v = Vec::new();
        foo(&mut v);
    }
    fn foo(h: &mut HashSet) {
    }
Output from playpen:

Happens for me on `rustc 1.1.0-nightly (f9e53c7f2 2015-04-24) (built
2015-04-25)`, and playpen is using beta, so it happens on that as well.
