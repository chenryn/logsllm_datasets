### Title: Reverse Engineering the Tesla Battery Management System to Increase Power Availability

In late 2014, Tesla introduced the dual-motor performance Model S, featuring "Insane Mode" with an advertised 0-60 mph acceleration time of 3.2 seconds. In July 2015, Tesla unveiled "Ludicrous Mode," which further reduced the 0-60 mph time to 2.8 seconds. This upgrade was made available both as a hardware and firmware update for existing P85D vehicles and as an option for new purchases. Subsequently, Tesla released the P90D and P100D models, each offering incremental performance improvements.

What makes the P85D upgrade particularly noteworthy is the insight it provides into how the vehicle's Battery Management System (BMS) handles power requests from the front and rear drive units. I undertook a reverse engineering project to understand this upgrade process by analyzing CAN bus messages, UDS routines, and various firmware files extracted from a rooted Tesla Model S or X. Additionally, I decrypted and decompiled Python source code used for diagnostics.

My analysis revealed that the upgrade process involved several key steps:
1. **Battery Pack Removal**: The battery pack was removed.
2. **Component Replacement**: The fuse and high-voltage contactors were replaced with components capable of handling higher amperage levels.
3. **Current Sensing Modification**: The current sensing high-voltage shunt inside the battery pack was modified to accurately respond to the increased amperage.

To validate these findings, I performed the upgrade on a donor P85D. I then modified the BMS firmware and the necessary files on the security gateway to accept the upgraded battery pack. Unfortunately, this process rendered the car inoperable, necessitating a tow to another state for troubleshooting. Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of the BMS's role in regulating the power available to the drive units. The BMS is the critical module that determines the maximum power that can be delivered to the drive units, ensuring that they do not exceed the limits set by the BMS.
