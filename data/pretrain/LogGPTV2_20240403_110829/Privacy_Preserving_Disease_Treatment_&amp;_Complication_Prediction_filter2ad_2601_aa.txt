ABSTRACT
Aﬀordable cloud computing technologies allow users to ef-
ﬁciently store, and manage their Personal Health Records
(PHRs) and share with their caregivers or physicians. This
in turn improves the quality of healthcare services, and lower
health care cost. However, serious security and privacy con-
cerns emerge because people upload their personal infor-
mation and PHRs to the public cloud. Data encryption
provides privacy protection of medical information but it
is challenging to utilize encrypted data. In this paper, we
present a privacy-preserving disease treatment, complica-
tion prediction scheme (P DT CP S), which allows autho-
rized users to conduct searches for disease diagnosis, per-
sonalized treatments, and prediction of potential complica-
tions. P DT CP S uses a tree-based structure to boost search
eﬃciency, a wildcard approach to support fuzzy keyword
search, and a Bloom-ﬁlter to improve search accuracy and
storage eﬃciency. In addition, our design also allows health
care providers and the public cloud to collectively gener-
ate aggregated training models for disease diagnosis, per-
sonalized treatments and complications prediction. More-
over, our design provides query unlinkability and hides both
search & access patterns. Finally, our evaluation results us-
ing two U CI datasets show that our scheme is more eﬃcient
and accurate than two existing schemes.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, cloud computing has emerged to be a pop-
ular technology that provides scalable and elastic storage
and computation resources for enterprises and individuals.
More and more organizations and individuals begin to em-
brace these beneﬁts by outsourcing their data into the cloud
[5]. For example: online personal health record (PHR) sys-
tems such as Microsoft HealthVaults allow patients to store

and manage their own medical records in the public cloud.
Such systems allow users easy access and sharing of their
personal health data.
Meanwhile, electronic health record systems contain vari-
ous types of patients’ information, which includes their de-
mographics, diagnosis codes, medication, allergies, and lab-
oratory test results [7],[18]. Such health related data is used
not just for primary care but also provides a promising av-
enue for improving healthcare related research. Data con-
sumers can gather large sets of health related information
including PHRs from users or healthcare providers and per-
form large scale analytic tasks, e.g., data-mining tasks to
predict disease epidemic [28] or for query and answering [1].
A number of repositories have also been set up to facili-
tate the dissemination and reuse of patient-speciﬁc data for
research advancement, e.g., the Database of Genotype and
Phenotype (dbGaP) [22]. In addition, work is currently un-
der way to construct the Nationwide Health Information
Network (NHIN) [2] to provide privacy-preserving search
over distributed, access controlled content.
Although the cloud-assisted healthcare systems oﬀer a
great opportunity to improve the quality of healthcare ser-
vices and potentially reduce healthcare costs, there are many
security and privacy concerns. For example, people have
started to realize that they would completely lose control
over their personal information once it enters the cyberspace.
In order to minimize the risk of data leakage to the cloud
service providers, sensitive data must be encrypted before
being outsourced into the cloud. By doing so, the cloud ser-
vice providers can only see data in encrypted form and never
learn any information about the encrypted data values.
However, this in turn makes data utilization challenging.
For instance, it is diﬃcult to apply machine learning tech-
niques to learn from aggregated privately encrypted data for
accurate predictions. In order to solve the problem, a set of
techniques has been developed (e.g., [6, 13, 16, 19]). While
some approaches [13, 16] demonstrated that basic machine
learning algorithms such as simple linear classiﬁers can be
performed eﬃciently to build models over a small scale en-
crypted dataset, their eﬃciency degraded rapidly as its size
grows. Though other techniques [6, 19] had utilized more
sophisticated classiﬁers (e.g., support vector machine) to ad-
dress the problem, either they lack security & privacy fea-
tures or require large computational cost. A recent work [21]
designed a scheme which provides machine learning mod-
els over encrypted dataset but their encryption scheme has
high computational and communication cost. Another re-
841cent work [10] also designed a scheme which allows data min-
ing over encrypted data but their scheme does not construct
encrypted index tree for eﬃcient search. Neither schemes
provide features to hide search and access patterns.
To overcome the above limitations, in this paper, we de-
sign a privacy-preserving disease treatment, complication
prediction scheme (P DT CP S), which allows authorized users
to conduct searches for disease diagnosis, personalized treat-
ments, and prediction of potential complications of their ill-
nesses.
In particular, we design an encrypted index tree
which supports fuzzy keyword queries. The tree-based struc-
ture is used to provide search eﬃciency. Each top level node
in our encrypted index tree contains an encrypted category
keyword that represents a speciﬁc body part, e.g., bone &
joints, kidneys, etc, and a Bloom ﬁlter which contains all the
disease keywords classiﬁed under this top level node, and
their associate fuzzy keyword sets. All relevant information,
e.g., associated diseases classiﬁed under each top-level node
will be stored in the 2nd level nodes. Each 2nd level node
(representing k diseases) has three child nodes, one for diag-
nosis, one for complication prediction and one for treatment
options. These three child nodes are leaf nodes. Each leaf
node stores relevant information about k diseases, including
a training model, its encrypted feature sets and the corre-
sponding Bloom ﬁlter containing fuzzy keyword set of each
disease. In addition, we include random components in our
design to provide query unlinkability, hide search and access
patterns. Such features strengthen further the security &
privacy capability of our design.
In addition, we present security analysis, and evaluate the
eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of our proposed scheme using two
datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Our
experimental results show that compared to two existing
schemes described in [21, 10], our scheme is more eﬃcient (in
terms of communication cost) and has higher accuracy than
both of these existing schemes. Additionally, our scheme ac-
commodates typos in users’ submitted requests, which could
not be handled by the existing schemes. In summary, our
contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We propose a Privacy-Preserving Disease Treatment,
Complication Prediction Scheme (P DT CP S), which
allows users to conduct privacy-aware searches with
high search eﬃciency and accuracy.
• P DT CP S is designed to handle typos in queries and
provide query unlinkability with minimal information
leakage.
• Our design allows healthcare providers and the pub-
lic cloud to collectively generate aggregated training
models for disease diagnosis, personalized treatments
and prediction of potential illness complications.
• We provide a formal security analysis to justify the
privacy-preserving guarantee of our proposed scheme.
• We present simulation results of our proposed scheme
using two UCI datasets, namely the PIMA Indians Di-
abetes and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Datasets.

tions of the system and threat models, our design goals,

2. RELATED WORK
2.1 Keyword Search over Encrypted Data
Searchable encryption (SE) is a cryptographic method
designed for users to securely conduct keyword search over
encrypted data.
in
[25], where their proposed scheme supports single keyword
search without an index and the server must scan the whole
document to ﬁnd the search result. After this work, many
improvements and novel schemes have been proposed.
It was ﬁrst proposed by Song et al.
Many SE schemes are either based on public key cryp-
tography (P KC) or symmetric key cryptography (SKC).
Boneh et al. [9] proposed the ﬁrst public key based search-
able encryption scheme. Then, to better protect the in-
dex and query privacy, Sahai and Waters [24] proposed the
idea of Attribute-based Encryption (ABE). In their work,
a decrypter could decrypt the message only if his attributes
are the same as what is speciﬁed by the encrypter. It was
later extended to the Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryp-
tion (KP − ABE) [15], in which a ciphertext is created
with an encryption policy involving a set of attributes. In
addition, S.Roy et al. [23] have presented an enhanced Ci-
phertext Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP − ABE)
scheme which provides the user revocation feature. In their
scheme, each client’s private key is associated with a set of
attributes and each ciphertext is encrypted with an access
policy so that the encrypted data can only be accessed by
the authorized clients.
Other works focus on enriching the search functionality,
e.g. providing ranked results, multi-keyword search or fuzzy
keyword search. For example, Cao et al.
[11] proposed
a privacy-preserving multi-keyword ranked search scheme,
which allows multi-keyword query and provides similarity
ranked results. To improve the search eﬃciency, Wenhai
Sun et al., proposed a tree-based search algorithm in [27].
In addition, Cong Wang et al. [29] proposed a symbol-based
tree-traverse searching mechanism to support fuzzy search
with constant search time independent of the size of the key-
word set. To enrich the search functionality, Chuah et al.
[12] introduced a tree structure index to support eﬃcient
keyword search and ﬂexible incremental updates.
2.2 Predictive Analysis over Encrypted Medi-
cal Data
The increasing availability of commercial options for stor-
ing and providing online access to patients’ electronic med-
ical records (EM R) has generated much interests among
researchers from various ﬁelds, e.g., data-mining or bioin-
formatics to build predictive models using data mining tech-
niques over large scale electronic healthcare data.
Most of these health data research works focus on design-
ing techniques to ensure privacy of sensitive data, or new
machine learning classiﬁcation methods, etc.
2.2.1 Privacy-preserving Health Data Protection
Privacy-preserving health data storage is studied by Sun
et al.
[26], where they design a secure healthcare system
HCP P to provide privacy protection on patients’ records.
Their scheme allows patients to store their encrypted health
data on a third-party server and conducts eﬃcient health
842information retrieval.
In addition, in [20], Li et al. have
proposed a cloud-based data-sharing framework where the
attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme was used to en-
crypt patients’ medical records. While their scheme provides
a strong guarantee that no one could mine any useful infor-
mation from the encrypted health data, it also makes data
utilization a very challenging task. For example, the public
cloud can only serve as a remote storage but it cannot con-
duct data mining over the encrypted data. Moreover, Guo
et al.
[17] proposed a veriﬁable privacy-preserving scheme
for a cloud-assisted mHealth system which can answer some
high level queries but they did not discuss how to generate
aggregated training models via machine learning techniques.
2.2.2 Privacy-preserving Health Data Mining
Many privacy-preserving data mining schemes for clini-
cal decision support can be grouped into two major cat-
egories: randomization based approaches and SMC-based
approaches.
In the randomization-based approaches, the
original data was protected by adding some random noise.
In [4], Agrawal and Srikant demonstrated that some statis-
tical properties could still be preserved when adding ran-
dom noise to the training data. As a result, a Naive Bayes
classiﬁer with comparable accuracy could still be obtained
from the sanitized data.
In [14], Evﬁmievski et al. pre-
sented a new “ampliﬁcation” method which limits privacy
breaches without the knowledge of data distribution. Using
their method, randomized data will be added to the original
data to avoid privacy breaches. While both proposed ran-
domization methods can protect the sensitive data, a trade
oﬀ needs to be made between accuracy and privacy.
Secure multiparty computation (SM C) is designed to al-
low multiple parties, each holding a private input, to collec-
tively perform a computation without disclosing information
more than the output reveals. For example, Lin et al.
in
[21] had designed a cloud-assisted mHealth monitoring sys-
tem that not only protects the data privacy, but also returns
treatment recommendations. In [10] the authors had con-
structed three major privacy-preserving classiﬁers including
hyperplane decision, Naive Bayes and decision trees to con-
duct models over encrypted data. While these schemes are
secure, they incur large computational and communication
costs.
3. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, we ﬁrst describe our system and threat
models. Then, we describe the design goals of our pro-
posed privacy-preserving disease treatments and complica-
tions prediction system (P DT CP S). Next, we provide de-
scriptions of some important building blocks used in our
solution.
3.1 System Model for PDTCPS
PDTCPS consists of four parties: the hospitals, the public
cloud server, a fully-trusted authority (TA), and individual
clients, as shown in Fig 1.
• Hospitals: Hospitals ﬁrst collect patients’ medical records,
encrypt them and store them in the private clouds
they owned. The private cloud servers may perform
data mining operations over the stored data to gener-
ate locally trained models. Based on these models, the
hospitals can later diagnose diseases, provide personal-
