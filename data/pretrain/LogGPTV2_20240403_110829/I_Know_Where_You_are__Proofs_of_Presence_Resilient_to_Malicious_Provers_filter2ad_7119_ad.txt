diﬀerent signal levels. For our scheme this is, however, not
a problem, since we are primarily interested in the changes
in the context values and not the absolute readings as such.
We therefore scale the context snapshots MV and MP by
applying a min-max scaling so that all scaled measurements
assume values between 0 and 100.
Similarly to the approach taken in Section 3, we use the
obtained distance measures calculated from the benign dat-
set to train a classiﬁcation model for co-location for making
predictions about whether a prover P ’s context measure-
ment is co-located with the veriﬁer V or not.
4.2.3 Evaluation Results
To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of using longitudinal mea-
surements of luminosity and audio as context modalities for
PoP, we added features 2 - 6 calulated based on luminos-
ity and audio to the WiFi and Bluetooth-based features we
used for the co-location classiﬁer in the basic PoP scheme.
We then evaluated the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent feature com-
binations on the benign and attack datasets. Table 3 shows
the results for the ConXPoP dataset (The ZIA dataset did
not contain luminosity nor audio measurements).
As can be seen, adding audio and luminosity as PoP fea-
tures signiﬁcantly decreases the False Positive rates for both
the benign and attack datasets’ classiﬁcation results. Espe-
cially for the attack dataset, the luminosity and audio con-
text modalities clearly outperform PoPs based on WiFi and
Bluetooth. This signiﬁcantly impacts the attacker’s ability
to succeed in context guessing attacks.
5. DISCUSSION
Our results show that in scenarios in which the prover
can not be trusted, context guessing attacks pose a serious
problem for contextual proofs-of-presence for some context
modalities like WiFi or Bluetooth observations. However,
by proﬁling the user’s contexts and using the surprisal of a
contextual PoP as a ﬁltering criterion, we can to some de-
gree mitigate this threat. The impact of the countermeasure
on the acceptance of benign PoPs is, however, dependent on
the type of context.
In contexts with only little dynamic
context information (e.g., a person’s home) it is challeng-
574ing to conduct valid PoPs with a suﬃcient surprisal. How-
ever, many contexts that are relevant for our usage scenar-
ios are typically public in nature (e.g., restaurants or shops)
and contain signiﬁcant amounts of dynamic context infor-
mation. The lack of surprisal in some context modalities
can be encountered by extending PoPs to further ambient
context modalities providing more entropy. As we showed
in Sect. 4.2, the addition of luminosity and audio to the
PoP modalities provide good performance against context
guessing attacks.
It seems therefore likely that constructing PoPs with suf-
ﬁcient surprisal in most contexts is feasible. In our future
work we intend to investigate this issue further. In situations
in which ambient context entropy is not suﬃcient (e.g., in a
dark and silent room during the night), PoPs can be still fea-
sible by combining the context-based and beaconing-based
PoP approaches. Our currently ongoing research regarding
the use of ambient context sensor modalities indicate, e.g.,
that beaconing-based PoPs using the visible light channel
are feasible. They require, however active user involvement,
which limits the applicability to such use cases, in which the
user is actively involved, e.g., making a location chek-in.
In contrast to other earlier works utilizing audio measure-
ments for co-location proofs [5, 15], our approach has con-
siderable privacy advantages since the PoP utilizes ambi-
ent noise level and not the actual ﬁne-grained audio signals.
Therefore, the prover P does not need to transmit poten-
tially sensitive audio recordings to the veriﬁer V in order
to obtain a proof-of-presence. This is important especially
in the peer-to-peer scenario, in which all users can assume
both the role of a prover P and a veriﬁer V .
5.1 Limitations
Relay attacks pose a fundamental problem for proof-of-
presence schemes, and to the best of our knowledge, only
distance-bounding based techniques (cf., e.g., [7]) are able to
provide an eﬀective protection against such attacks. How-
ever, the drawback of distance bounding is, that it requires
special high-accuracy hardware that is typically not avail-
able on regular mobile devices.
For our application scenarios, relay attacks would not
seem to pose a major problem for economic reasons. For in-
stance, in the peer-to-peer scenario, it would be prohibitively
complex and costly for a malicious prover to place an accom-
plice in all possible contexts that a targeted user visits. In
LBS scenarios it might be conceivable that some malicious
clients could be motivated to stage targeted relay attacks
against selected venues. However, also here the usage of
several diﬀerent contextual modalities for PoPs signiﬁcantly
raises the complexity and cost of the attack for a potential
attacker and especially his possible accomplices. A simple
replaying of PoP protocol messages by the attacker’s accom-
plice would not be suﬃcient, but the accomplice would need
to actively participate in sensing the context of the veriﬁer
in several diﬀerent context modalities.
6. RELATED WORK
Closely related to our work are the papers by Truong et
al. [15] and Shrestha et al. [14]. They use direct measure-
ments of elements of the ambient context for determining
the co-presence of two devices in a zero-interaction authen-
tication scenario. However, they assume both endpoints of
the scenario to be trusted. The context guessing attack is
therefore not applicable to their scenario.
The concept of using context-proﬁling for evaluating con-
texts for security enforcement has been discussed by Gupta
et al. [4]. Their work focuses on estimating the threat level in
a particular context for the purpose of making access con-
trol decisions. Our work, takes a diﬀerent viewpoint: we
estimate the occurrence probability of a particular context
measurement in view of the observation history, in order to
estimate the threat of a guessing attack.
6.1 Beaconing-based Proofs of Presence
Saroiu and Wolman [12] hypothesize six diﬀerent LBS-
based scenarios, in which users of the LBS might have an
incentive to engage in location cheating. To tackle such sce-
narios, they propose a simple protocol for providing loca-
tion proofs based on beaconing of information over the WiFi
SSID of dedicated access points (APs) installed at the tar-
get venue. The proof of presence is based on the fact that
only devices in the access point’s proximity will be able to
receive these beacon signals. Our solution, however, is not
dependent on dedicated APs.
Another approach based on beaconing of information into
the context is the SMILE framework of Manweiler et al. [9],
which allows users to establish proofs of co-location after an
encounter that took place between the users. It is based on
users’ devices beaconing cryptographic keys into the prox-
imity of their device and recording keys beaconed by other
devices. Later the devices are able to rediscover each other
with the help of a third-party server. Contrary to our ap-
proach, SMILE requires the use of a central server and re-
quires all devices to engage simultaneously in beaconing and
scanning of the context, potentially impacting the privacy
of users by making their devices traceable across diﬀerent
contexts. Carbunar et al. [3] present a scheme for privacy-
preserving Geo-Social Network logins. They utilize mix net-
works and a protocol involving blind signatures to provide
GeoBadges, i.e., anonymous proofs of repeated visits to a
speciﬁc venue. Their system relies on dedicated hardware at
the venues, like display changing QR codes used for location
veriﬁcation. Polakis et al. [11] present a similar scheme for
location proofs, which relies on the use of temporary codes
which a location-based service can verify. These codes are
transmitted over NFC to client devices. The use of NFC as a
close proximity protocol thus acts as the proof of co-location.
6.2 Context-based Proofs of Presence
Varshavsky et al. [16] describe a system for co-location
veriﬁcation. They combine Diﬃe-Hellman key agreement
with proﬁling of WiFi packets for veriﬁcation of co-location.
They compare the received signal strengths of the received
packets on a WiFi network in common for both parties. If
these are similar enough, the peers are determined to be
co-located. According to their paper, the protection of this
scheme arises from the fact that ﬂuctuations in the RF en-
vironment are unpredictable and spatially limited. Devices
located close to each other will be able to observe such ﬂuc-
tuations, whereas devices that are farther away from each
other will not be able to do so. However, due to this same
property, the prover and veriﬁer need to be located relatively
close to each other in order for their approach to work, lim-
iting its practical applicability. Most real-world scenarios,
in which peers are in the same room (e.g., Alice and Bob at
575the same restaurant), but not in immediate proximity would
not be feasible using their approach.
Narayanan et al. [10] present three alternative asymmetric
protocols for principals to test for proximity in a privacy-
preserving manner. Their solutions are based on Private
Equality Testing and Private Threshold Set Intersection.
They also utilise location tags obtained by the principals
from ambient information in the context. They discuss lo-
cation tags derived from WiFi broadcast packets, WiFi ac-
cess point IDs, Bluetooth devices, GPS signals, GSM radio
features, audio ﬁngerprinting, and, even atmospheric gases,
but present practical analysis only for the WiFi broadcast
packet-based solution. They estimated that using the ad-
dress ﬁelds, the packet sequence numbers and packet pay-
load, one could obtain roughly 10 bits of entropy from each
broadcast protocol. Their approach, however, has some
practical limitations, which they also acknowledge. Firstly,
the prover and veriﬁer need to agree on using the same WiFi
access point and both be able to connect to it. Therefore,
the method is not applicable in situations in which no access
points are available, or, access to the AP is password pro-
tected. The ability to generate location tags is also heavily
dependent on the traﬃc patterns of the WiFi access points.
On more low-traﬃc networks like residential private access
points, acquiring a suﬃcient number of packets during a
reasonable time frame might actually be challenging. The
work by Varshavsky et al. [16] suﬀers from similar limita-
tions. Also, in some jurisdictions, it is legally prohibited to
intercept packets from foreign networks without proper au-
thorisation or explicit permission of the network’s operator.
6.3 Distance-Bounding Based Approaches
Hu et al. [7] investigated the problem of proximity veriﬁ-
cation in the context of mobile ad-hoc networks as a defence
against wormhole attacks. They proposed to use a distance
bounding approach in order to verify an upper limit on the
distance to a node in the network. The distance bound-
ing approach, however, requires the ability to make tim-
ing measurements with a very high accuracy and is usually
not possible without special hardware. Distance bounding
is therefore usually not feasible on regular mobile devices.
Also Polakis et al. [11] and Carbunar et al. [2] proposed the
use of distance-bounding in their schemes in order to pro-
tect against relay attacks. This attack is feasible for our
scenario, but not very relevant, since the attacker would
need to instrument all target contexts with a relaying node.
Given the vast amount of diﬀerent contexts that an attacker
would want to target, this would be clearly uneconomical
for the vast majority of potential attackers.
7. SUMMARY
We show that context-guessing attacks can impact con-
text-based proofs-of-presence in scenarios where a veriﬁer
cannot fully trust the prover. The feasibility of such at-
tacks is shown on traces of Bluetooth and Wiﬁ mobile data.
To alleviate context guessing, a methodology based on the
surprisal related to context measurements is designed and
formalized. The eﬀectiveness of this mitigation methodol-
ogy is demonstrated on measurements collected from mobile
phones. Our work also shows that in case there is insuﬃcient
entropy to encounter the context guessing, such attacks can
be further thwarted by adding ambient context modalities
to the PoP which is experimented using measurements of
ambient luminosity and noise levels.
