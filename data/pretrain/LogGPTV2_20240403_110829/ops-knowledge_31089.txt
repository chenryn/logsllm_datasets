User: I am learning the web framework Tornado. During the study of this framework, I found the class  tornado.httpserver.HTTPserver. I know how to create a constructor of this class and create instance tornado.httpserver.HTTPserver in main() function. But this class tornado.httpserver.HTTPserver  has 4 methods. I have not found how to use these methods.
1) def close_all_connections(self):
2)  def handle_stream(self, stream, address):
3)  def start_request(self, server_conn, request_conn):
4)  def on_close(self, server_conn):
I know that 2-4 methods are inherited from the class tornado.tcpserver.TCPServer
Can someone illustrate how to use these methods of a class tornado.httpserver.HTTPserver?
Assistant: These methods are used internally; you shouldn't call them yourself.
