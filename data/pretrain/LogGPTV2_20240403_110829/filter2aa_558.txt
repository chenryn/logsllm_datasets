After 35 years of serious investigation, exploration, and reflection, engaged with the best 
researchers in the field, it was time to make as succinct and clear a statement as I could, 
within the constraints of 1200 words for the Crossroads section in the Sunday Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel.  
It was also a way for a mainstream newspaper, the winner of many awards, to implicitly 
suggest that the subject is more than tabloid fodder.

A Confession: Out of the Closet on UFOs - February 16 2014 
Let me put it to you straight. For 35 years I have been exploring and investigating UFOs 
and UFOlogy (both the serious endeavor and the silly speculative fare that fills popular 
culture) and ... well, UFOs are real: They fly, they evince technologies we don’t 
understand, and they have been around for years. 
Above all, despite voluminous and overwhelming evidence to support those assertions, to 
raise this subject as worthy of historical and scientific investigation is to invite ridicule, 
the shaking of pitying heads, derision and hostility, and embarrassed silence. 
Still, I persist in believing, as Francis Bacon said in 1620, that if something deserves to 
exist, it deserves to be known, not rejected out of hand with prejudice. The scientific 
method, principles of historical analysis, and an open mind ask that much. 
No subject has been more marginalized and maligned than this topic. By “unidentified 
flying objects” I mean not the many things commonly mistaken for them – balloons, 
Venus, sprites, ball lightning, secret craft, etc.– I mean anomalous vehicles which for 
decades have been well documented by credible observers (“Credible people have seen 
incredible things,” said General John Samford, US Air Force Chief of Intelligence, in 
1953), to which our government responded with the formulation and execution of 
policies in light of genuine national security concerns.  
I was recently privileged to be included as contributing editor and writer on a team that 
produced the book, “UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry” over five years. The 
research/writing team was led by Dr. Michael Swords, a professor of Natural Science 
(ret.) at Western Michigan University and Robert Powell, a nanotechnologist formerly 
with AMD. The book is regarded as an “exception” to the dreary field by CHOICE, the 
journal that recommends works for inclusion in university collections. CHOICE 
suggested that all university libraries should have it (to date, 45 have it in their 
collections, including 4 in the U-Wisconsin system, as well as many Wisconsin public 
libraries). The almost-600 page book is well grounded with nearly 1000 citations from 
government documents and other primary sources so it is “bullet proof.” There is 
virtually nothing speculative in it. We document the response of governments from the 
1940s forward to events they took quite seriously—and which readers, judging on the 
evidence and data, will take seriously as well. 
A short column can not do justice to the complex narrative, but I can state a few facts.  
(1) Any other domain of inquiry with hundreds of well-documented events would be 
considered worthy of scientific and historical investigation.   
(2) Well-executed policies carried out with secrecy do not constitute “a conspiracy,” 
and we are not “conspiracy theorists,” a term used to denigrate investigators of 
unpopular subjects.  Members of the military and intelligence community, from 
the early 1950s on, decided to learn as much as they could about UFOs – which 
they decided did not constitute a direct threat to national security – while at the 
same time playing down and dismissing reports from the public. The reports 
themselves were considered to be the primary threat by the CIA. 
(3)  The data illuminates phenomena that is global, persistent, and sufficiently similar 
in small details to invite taxonomic classification as to vehicle types, the physics 
of force fields which power the objects and ionize the air around it, producing 
characteristic colors in relationship to speed and power, and diverse kinds of 
robotic or sentient beings associated with the objects. 
(4) It is an astonishing sociological and psychological event that throughout the 
twentieth century, reports by credible observers, corroborated on multiple radar 
sets on the ground and in jets, resulted not in public investigation but in an 
inability to get our minds around the mere possibility. Instead the subject is 
literally “unthinkable.” 
(5) One reason it is“unthinkable” is the effective use of ridicule, the mocking of 
people who made reports or took the subject seriously, and a long silence from 
official authoritative voices in the face of credible testimony. When I delivered a 
speech and served on a panel recently at the NSA, I was reminded by a veteran 
analyst that “the three legs of cover and deception are illusion, misdirection, and 
ridicule. But the greatest of these is ridicule”—which discredits the person, not 
the testimony, and the testimony I have heard has come from military and civilian 
pilots, astronauts, even the intelligence head of a foreign military force. “This is 
what I saw, and I know what I saw” is what I am told, corroborating the statement 
in 1947 by Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining that “The phenomena is something real and 
not visionary or fictitious.” 
(6) My personal exploration began in 1978 when, as a recently ordained Episcopal 
clergyman in a parish on the edge of an Air Force base, a parishioner, a decorated 
fighter pilot with all the “right stuff” who retired as a Colonel, told me, “We chase 
them and we can’t catch them.”  
(7) “UFOs and Government” includes quotations from generals, senior intelligence 
personnel, and professionals like Hermann Oberth, the father of German rocketry, 
that affirm the exotic characteristics of the technology that no earthly power could 
then achieve. As Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell told me, “Richard, if we 
could do what they can do, they wouldn’t have sent me to the moon in a tin 
lizzie.”  
(8) We increasingly accept through our own scientific explorations that many earth-
like planets likely to harbor life fill our galaxy and galaxies beyond. When we 
hear that from authoritative voices, we accept it as a probability, but when we 
examine the evidence of decades of visitation by real explorers, we find it difficult 
to think in a concrete way that we are not alone, not the top of the food chain, and 
that others may have been voyaging for thousands of years—as if we are the gold 
standard of scientific knowledge and our current understanding of physics is the 
end of all physics. 
So I’m out of the closet on a subject. As an older man with a solid track record of 
delivering insights into likely futures that have pretty much worked out over the years, a 
man who has spoken for security conferences all over the world (including NSA, the FBI, 
the Secret Service, the US Department of the Treasury, the Pentagon, etc.), discussing the 
impact of new technologies, I can say without embarrassment that documented data 
supports the contention that many historical reports show exactly what they seem to show 
–anomalous vehicular traffic demonstrating aerodynamic capabilities and propulsion 
systems beyond the range of our own technology. 
So ... why do well-intentioned people who know more than I do persist in the pretense 
that nothing unusual has been going on? That’s a more speculative exploration, one for 
another time.
