MinEC heuristics fare the best while the Two-Hop and Degree
heuristics fare the worst. This shows that MinEC combines
the best of both worlds of the One-Hop and Two-Hop heuris-
tics by improving the network connectivity for honest nodes
under heavy churn while not compromising on the security
of random walks under strategic attacks.
Figure 6 plots the number of 2-hop honest and attack
edges created as a result of increasing 1-hop attack edges.
Increase in 1-hop attack edges has little impact on the num-
ber of 2-hop honest edges, while drastically increasing the 2-
hop attack edges. We note that the Two-Hop heuristic results
in an order of magnitude increase in 2-hop honest edges and
two-to-three orders of magnitude increase in 2-hop attack
edges. This explains high network connectivity (low discon-
nection probability) at the cost of very poor attack resilience
514(high escape probability). Also, this result validates our hy-
pothesis in Sec. 5.1. In contrast, both the Common Neigh-
bors and MinEC heuristics result in the most 2-hop honest
edges (apart from the Two-Hop heuristic), and the least 2-
hop attack edges (apart from the OneHop heuristic), which
explains their performance in terms of both disconnection
probability and escape probability. More speciﬁcally, MinEC
has a noticeably superior performance to the Common Neigh-
bors heuristic because fewer 2-hop attack edges are created
by the former compared to that of the latter while creating
similar number of 2-hop honest edges.
Unavailability. Figure 7 shows the impact of unavailability
on the robustness of the system. In terms of disconnection
probability, increasing the unavailability helps disintegrat-
ing the overlay to an extent that the fraction of all online
honest nodes belonging to the largest connected component
decreases. Even at high levels of unavailability upto c = 0.9,
our heuristic (MinEC) fares as good as the Two-Hop heuristic.
Among the three datasets, Epinions has the poorest network
connectivity which is due to its relatively low average degree
with respect to the honest region (see Table 1).
In terms of escape probability, the MinEC heuristic fares
nearly as good as the One-Hop heuristic, while the Degree
heuristic fares the worst. We note that the escape proba-
bility increases as the unavailability increases, despite the
number of 1-hop attack edges remaining the same during
the experiment. This is because of two factors: (i) strategic
placement of (1-hop) attack edges where higher degree hon-
est nodes are targeted, and (ii) the default value of γ = 0.5
indicates that mostly higher degree honest nodes are online
particularly at high unavailability, while all the Sybil nodes
are online at that instance. In essence, combining the re-
sults based on both metrics suggests the robustness of our
heuristic under signiﬁcant levels of churn.
Selective k 2-Hop Neighbors. Figure 8 shows the ef-
fect of the number of 2-hop neighbors k used by the various
heuristics except the One-Hop and Two-Hop heuristics.
In
terms of disconnection probability, each of these heuristics
increases the robustness of the social overlay network as the
number of 2-hop neighbors k used increases. We note that
the MinEC heuristic achieves the level of network connectiv-
ity similar to that of the Two-Hop heuristic with the fewest
2-hop neighbors compared to other heuristics. In the case
of AstroPhysics and Facebook, MinEC requires k = 100 (or
fewer) 2-hop neighbors to have as low a disconnection prob-
ability as the Two-Hop heuristic, while the other heuristics
need k = 500 (or more) 2-hop neighbors for similar perfor-
mance. In the case of Epinions, the MinEC heuristic requires
about k = 500 2-hop neighbors to have as good network con-
nectivity as the Two-Hop heuristic, while the other heuristics
require nearly k = 5000 for similar extent of connectivity.
In terms of escape probability, each heuristic performs
diﬀerently as the number of 2-hop neighbors k increases.
