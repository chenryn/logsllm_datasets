mains, 1,453 customer site domains, and 7,236,315 cus-
tomer search URLs from the crawling results of the total
21 spider pools.
In terms of the number of used SEO domains, we ﬁnd
it largely differs between spider pools, which varies from
100 to 1,933 and is averaged at 753. Regarding served
customers, some spider pools include a large amount of
search URLs: the maximum number for one spider pool
is 2.6M. Such result should be taken with a grain of salt,
since the URLs could be dynamically built for each visit
from our crawler. On the other hand, the maximum of
customer sites promoted by spider pool is only 710. We
ﬁnd that different spider pools tend to have big overlap
of customer sites. By looking into the popular spider
pool toolkit, we found that a lot of customer sites are
included by default. This can explain the big overlap
to some extent. Still, we ﬁnd several different types of
business (mostly illegal) leveraging spider pools for pro-
motion and we elaborate our study in Section 5.3.
We are also interested in how good the security com-
panies are at capturing the spider pool domains. To an-
swer this question, we scanned all 15,816 SEO domains
using VirusTotal in Feb 2016. Surprisingly, only 474 do-
mains (2.9%) were ﬂagged by at least one blacklist re-
cruited by VirusTotal. The reason could be that most
of SEO domains do not contain malicious content, like
drive-by-download code and phishing page, since their

5.3 Customers
We now extend our study to the customers who employ
spider pools to promote their business. We ﬁrst extract
customers’ sites referred by SEO pages and classify them
into different categories according to the business they
served. Also from the inﬁltration study on SSP, we dis-
cover that the adversary invent a new promotion tech-
nique which abuses the reputation of popular sites to
advertise her messages, and such message promotion is
also observed in other 20 spider pools as well. We are in-
terested in which sites are abused and how the messages
are composed, and we present our measurement results
below.
Customer sites characterization. We examine all the
crawled web pages from the 1,453 identiﬁed customer
sites, and cluster them through content analysis. Previous
works studying spam/scam campaigns [28, 50] looked
into the HTML DOM structure and grouped the pages
under the similar structure, on the premise that most
pages are built with a small set of templates. How-
ever, the pages we have analyzed here do not follow such
premise as the page structures are quite diverse. We ad-
dress this problem through a different way: we used the
well-established nature language processing (NLP) tech-
niques to parse the page’s abstract (including title, meta
keywords and meta description) into terms and identify
the topic model [4] based on the term frequency. We
leveraged an online document analysis service [5] to au-
tomate this process, which classiﬁes a document into one

of the topics pre-determined. Then, we manually exam-
ined the results and adjusted the topic when it is incor-
rect. The names of some topics were reﬁned to better
characterize the business as well. Through this proce-
dure, we were able to cluster 930 sites 11 into 7 topics.
Table 7 lists these topics and the number of correspond-
ing sites. We elaborate each topic in Appendix C.
Different from the results revealed by previous studies
on search poisoning [31], we do not ﬁnd any customer
site delivering malware or phishing content. Moreover,
we identiﬁed new types of business, other than stores
selling fake goods or pharmacies [28,34]. It turns out the
goals of the customers are mainly to promote their illegal
business without unveiling traces to local legal authori-
ties. As an example, surrogacy is banned in China [7] and
the agents behind cannot advertise their business through
well regulated channels like TV commercials. Therefore,
they spammed the search results using spider pool as an
alternative.
Customer message characterization. Starting from the
15K spider pool domains, we identiﬁed over 7.2M mes-
sage URLs free-riding reputable sites. The adversaries
tend to keep a pool of candidate sites and attach the mes-
sage to their search URLs randomly.
In Table 8, the
top 20 sites being abused are listed and the topmost site
serves 114K message URLs. All of these sites are listed
in Alexa top 1M, including highly reputable ones, like
amazon.com and ebay.com. For a search engine, these
message URLs should be removed, which however is not
a trivial task because valid search results about popu-
lar goods on sites like amazon.com are also included in
Google and should not be pruned.
We then look into the promoted messages. Most of
them are composed of a long-tail keyword (e.g., “where
to buy hallucinogen”) and contact (e.g., “the QQ of cus-
tomer service is: 90909090”). While the long-tail key-
word is readable, the contact number is usually obfus-
cated.
In particular, we saw “0” is replaced with “o”
(“9o9o9o9o”) and special symbol was inserted into the
number (“909-909-909”). We suspect such obfuscation
11The remaining 523 sites were not processed because their abstracts
were invalid, the sites were down when we crawled their homepages or
the clusters they belong to were small.

Impact on Search Engines
is used to evade detection of automated tools. Through
some manual efforts, we created rules which map the ob-
fuscated number to original one and were able to parse
about half of the 7.2M messages (3M). In the end, we
identiﬁed 23 QQ numbers accounting for 2.4M messages
which are all related to illegal services. The details of
these numbers are shown in Table 9 of Appendix D. We
think extracting the contact information is meaningful
for search engines or other departments. By tracing from
the contact information, the identities of the criminals
could be revealed, which can greatly facilitate criminal
investigation.
5.4
Spider pool is mainly used to increase the visiting fre-
quency from search crawlers and we evaluate its effec-
tiveness by examining the logs collected on our servers
used for inﬁltration study of SSP. In addition, we look
into how search results under long-tail keywords are ma-
nipulated.
Visit frequency from search engines. After 14 days,
the targeted search engines (Google, Baidu) began to in-
dex the homepage and other pages under our test site
(his-and-hers.xyz). To determine if the effects from
spider pool are consistent, we relaunched our testing
SEO campaign and added 2 additional sites 12 into SSP
after a pausing period. Statistics are plotted in Figure 9
for Google and Baidu respectively. As shown in both ﬁg-
ures, the effects are obvious: the average number of visits
per day jumped from 28 to 66 for Google and from 4.5
to 37.5 for Baidu during the campaign. Once the cam-
12happysky.info and ttaabb.org were purchased on Dec 6th,
2015 from Godaddy and we set up websites on them using templates
downloaded from http://www.dedecms.com/ and http://www.
emlog.net/.
