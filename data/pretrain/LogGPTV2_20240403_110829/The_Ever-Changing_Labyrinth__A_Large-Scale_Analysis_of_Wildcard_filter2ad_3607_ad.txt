### All SEO Domains and New SEO Domains
**Figure 8: The number of all SEO domains and newly recruited domains observed each day for SSP.**

The data shows the daily count of all SEO domains and newly added domains over a 25-day period.

### Spider Pool Analysis
We analyzed a total of 15,816 SEO domains, 1,453 customer site domains, and 7,236,315 customer search URLs from the crawling results of 21 spider pools.

#### SEO Domain Usage
- **Variation in SEO Domain Count**: The number of SEO domains used by each spider pool varies significantly, ranging from 100 to 1,933, with an average of 753.
- **Customer Search URLs**: Some spider pools include a large number of search URLs, with the maximum for one spider pool being 2.6 million. However, this figure should be interpreted cautiously, as the URLs may be dynamically generated for each visit from our crawler.
- **Customer Site Overlap**: The maximum number of customer sites promoted by a single spider pool is 710. We observed significant overlap in the customer sites across different spider pools. This overlap can be partly explained by the inclusion of many customer sites by default in popular spider pool toolkits.

#### Security Analysis
To assess the effectiveness of security companies in detecting spider pool domains, we scanned all 15,816 SEO domains using VirusTotal in February 2016. Surprisingly, only 474 domains (2.9%) were flagged by at least one blacklist. This low detection rate may be due to the fact that most SEO domains do not contain malicious content, such as drive-by-download code or phishing pages, as their primary purpose is SEO.

### Section 5.3: Customers
#### Customer Sites Characterization
We examined all the crawled web pages from the 1,453 identified customer sites and classified them into different categories based on the business they served. Our analysis revealed that the main goal of these customers is to promote illegal businesses without leaving traces for local legal authorities. For example, surrogacy, which is banned in China, is often advertised through spider pools.

#### Table 7: Classification of Customers' Sites
| Topic                | #Domains | Ratio  |
|----------------------|----------|--------|
| Sales and Services    | 202      | 21.72% |
| Gambling             | 190      | 20.43% |
| Surrogacy            | 156      | 16.77% |
| News                 | 156      | 16.77% |
| Sex                  | 114      | 12.26% |
| Games                | 84       | 9.03%  |
| Hospitals and Drugs  | 28       | 3.02%  |
| Total                | 930      | 100%   |

#### Customer Message Characterization
Starting from the 15,000 spider pool domains, we identified over 7.2 million message URLs free-riding reputable sites. The adversaries tend to keep a pool of candidate sites and attach messages to their search URLs randomly.

#### Impact on Search Engines
The obfuscation techniques used in the contact information (e.g., replacing "0" with "o" or inserting special symbols) are likely intended to evade automated detection tools. By manually creating rules to map the obfuscated numbers to their original forms, we were able to parse about half of the 7.2 million messages (3 million). We identified 23 QQ numbers accounting for 2.4 million messages, all related to illegal services. Extracting this contact information is valuable for search engines and law enforcement agencies, as it can help trace the identities of the criminals.

### Section 5.4: Effectiveness of Spider Pools
Spider pools are primarily used to increase the visiting frequency from search crawlers. We evaluated their effectiveness by examining the logs collected on our servers during the infiltration study of SSP. After 14 days, the targeted search engines (Google and Baidu) began to index the homepage and other pages under our test site (his-and-hers.xyz). To determine if the effects from the spider pool are consistent, we relaunched our testing SEO campaign and added two additional sites (happysky.info and ttaabb.org) after a pausing period.

**Figure 9: Google (upper) & Baidu (lower) Visit Count**
- **First Period**: The average number of visits per day jumped from 28 to 66 for Google and from 4.5 to 37.5 for Baidu during the campaign.
- **Second Period**: The effects remained consistent, indicating the effectiveness of spider pools in increasing search engine visits.

This detailed analysis provides insights into the operational and security aspects of spider pools, highlighting their use in promoting illegal activities and the challenges in detecting and mitigating their impact.
