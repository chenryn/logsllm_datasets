User: How to monitor network traffic and issue real-time alarms for abnormal traffic?
Assistant: Network traffic monitoring and abnormal alarm can be realized through the following steps: 1. Select appropriate network traffic monitoring tools, such as Wireshark, PRTG network monitoring tools, etc., and select appropriate functions and configurations according to requirements. 2. Set monitoring targets, select network devices and network traffic types to be monitored, and set monitoring parameters including bandwidth utilization, traffic distribution statistics, load balancing, etc. 3. Set thresholds, formulate traffic thresholds and alarm policies, and monitor traffic according to the set thresholds and alarm policies. 4. Set abnormal alarm conditions, such as exceeding the set threshold, sudden increase or sharp drop in traffic and other abnormal conditions. 5. Set the alarm method and select the alarm method according to the actual needs, including email, text message, phone call, WeChat and other methods. 6. Carry out real-time monitoring, through monitoring data analysis, find abnormal situations in time, and report to the police in time. 7. Execute processing measures, such as determining the type of abnormality, repairing the abnormality, and recording the abnormality log to provide support for subsequent adjustments and optimizations. It should be noted that network traffic monitoring and abnormal alarms require all-round and full-cycle monitoring, periodically analyze and summarize the monitoring data, and make appropriate adjustments and optimizations to ensure network stability and security.
