### Version
2.5.17
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/jcatfour/g6ykuwhe/
### Steps to reproduce
Try to change the dropdown value. The text displayed in the select box will
almost always stay as "Today", despite the value changing, though it SOMETIMES
will actually change to the correct value. Again, as you can see, the actual
value is indeed changing even if the select box does not show it.
### What is expected?
The options in the select are based on an array of value pairs, (text, val).
The text is what should be shown in the select, and the val is what should be
actually passed and stored in the data object. I expect the text to change as
well as the value when selecting an option.
### What is actually happening?
The value changes every time, but the text mostly stays unchanged, BUT the
text does very rarely change as expected.

If this were CONSISTENTLY showing the wrong text with the right value, I would
assume that I am just doing something wrong, but since it's infrequent, I'm
now not so sure. I would not be surprised if I was doing something wrong. I am
going insane, please be my savior.
