User: I seem to be in a never ending tail spin of Linux, or not, Windows or not. Web programming or system programming. Python or PHP.
I'am self teaching myself programming. But it seems I keep being torn about which way to go. Unfortunately it is always seemingly good reasons to get side tracked. You know the whole open source or proprietary thing. Lately I have decided after a year that Linux just doesn't cut it for me and it mostly stems from me wanting to watch videos on Channel 9 etc, and the clunkiness that is Linux. So that lead me to, "Should I learn ASP.NET, since I am more so deciding Windows IS a "necessary" evil.
I hope this made sense. The reason I settled in on Web Development as my course to learning programming is because I actually have a task to implement rather then aimlessly reading reference books etc.
Does anyone have any advice at what they may have done to stay focused and not get lead down every tangent or idea.

This is exactly the course to follow.  I think most of us get into programming the same way.  Find a problem and work out its solution in whatever technology is appropriate.  Keep looking for problems that are interesting to you, and you'll find your own answer (which is probably different than my own answer) to this question.
