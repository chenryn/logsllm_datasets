progressive ones. When looking for instance at the most compact CCA2-fully
anonymous group signatures in the standard model under standard assumptions
(SXDH and XDLIN) by Libert et al. [LPY15], signature sizes in the best case
will have 30 G1 and 14 G2 elements (≈ 15000 bit when taking the setting in Ta-
ble 1), large public keys and computation times that are far from being feasible
for resource constrained devices.
Regarding signature generation, we emphasize that our CPA-fully anony-
mous instantiation is the fastest among all schemes used for comparison (even
among the ones providing CCA− anonymity), and, to the best of our knowl-
edge, the fastest among all existing schemes. This is of particular importance
since signature generation is most likely to be executed on a constrained device.
Regarding signature veriﬁcation our CPA-fully anonymous instantiation is only
outperformed by the CCA− anonymous instantiation in [PS16].
Signature Size. Comparing schemes providing the same anonymity guar-
antees, our CPA-fully anonymous instantiation even provides shorter signature
sizes than the popular BBS scheme [BBS04] and, to the best of our knowledge,
the shortest signature sizes among all CPA-fully anonymous schemes. Regarding
CCA2-fully anonymous schemes, it seems that gained eﬃciency in the “without
explicit encryption” paradigm comes at the cost of larger signatures compared
to instantiations following the SEP paradigm.
6.2 Implementation Results
To conﬁrm the relative performance advantage of our scheme as presented in
Table 1 (where we present estimations on a smart card like device using the per-
formance ﬁgures from [UW14]), we benchmarked actual Java implementations
of the scheme in [DP06] and our CCA2-fully anonymous scheme using the JMH
benchmarking framework9 and the BN-pairing implementation of the ECCeler-
ate library.10 The benchmarks were run on an Intel Core i7-4790 CPU with 16
GB RAM running Ubuntu 17.04. Clearly, on such a powerful platform signature
generation and veriﬁcation is much faster (signature generation and veriﬁcation
are not even noticable). However, it still gives us an insight in the accuracy of our
estimations with respect to the relative computational costs of the schemes. We
compare the absolute numbers of possible signing operations per second (i.e., the
throughput) for both schemes. Our results show that our scheme allows twice as
much signature generations per second as [DP06] (34.589 ops/s vs. 17.067ops/s),
which shows that our relative performance advantage is even slightly better than
suggested by the estimations. When increasing the bitlength of p, our scheme
even gets more favorable compared to all other schemes, which is mainly due
to the fact that we do not require operations in the computationally expensive
target group GT . For example, when switching from 100 bit security (which
is the current estimate for 256 bit BN-curves [BD18]) to 128 bit security (i.e.,
9 http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/
10 https://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core_Crypto_Toolkits/ECCelerate
462 bit BN-curves [BD18]), we can even compute ≈ 2.5 times more signatures
than [DP06].
7 Conclusion
In this paper we further pushed the eﬃciency limits of CPA- as well as CCA2-fully
anonymous group signature schemes with respect to signature generation and
veriﬁcation. We also pushed the limits with respect to signature size for CPA-
fully anonymous group signature schemes. We observe that our construction is
the only one which does neither require any pairing computations nor computa-
tions in the target group GT upon signature creation, which makes it especially
suitable for constrained devices. It is also interesting to note that the dynamic
Join in [DP06] (and also for [BBS04] when turning it into a dynamic scheme)
requires an extractable commitment to a discrete logarithm, which renders their
Join procedure rather ineﬃcient. The suggestion in [DP06] is to use Paillier en-
cryption, which besides adding an additional hardness assumption (DCR) in
the hidden order group (factoring-based) setting, induces a rather signiﬁcant
performance penalty due to an additional expensive equality proof of discrete
logarithms in two diﬀerent groups (see, e.g., [CM99]). In contrast, our scheme
achieves this without any such performance penalty and without additionally
requiring the hidden-order setting. Finally, our results aﬃrmatively answer the
theoretical question whether CPA- as well as CCA2-fully anonymous schemes fol-
lowing the “without explicit encryption” paradigm are possible at all. Finally,
we want to mention that recently Fuchsbauer and Gay [FG18] have proposed a
variant of SPS-EQ with a relaxed unforgeability notion under standard assump-
tions, i.e., Matrix-Diﬃe-Hellman assumptions. They show that their scheme can
be plugged into the group signature construction in this paper. However, relying
on standard assumption comes at the cost of decreased performance, making the
resulting scheme less attractive regarding eﬃciency.

A Plausibility of co-CDHI
To justify that co-CDHI is a plausible assumption, we state the following addi-
tional assumption in the Type-3 bilinear group setting, which falls into the Uber
assumption family [Boy08] with R = (cid:104)1, 1/b(cid:105), S = (cid:104)1, b(cid:105), T = (cid:104)1(cid:105), and f = b2.
Deﬁnition 28. Relative to BGGen we have that for all PPT adversaries A there
exists a negligible function ε(·) such that:
(cid:104)
BG ← BGGen(1κ), b ←R Zp, c ← A(BG, 1/bP, b ˆP ) : c = e(P, ˆP )b2(cid:105) ≤ ε(κ).
Pr
Lemma 3. If the assumption in Deﬁnition 28 holds, then also the co-CDHI
assumption holds.
Proof. Assume a co-CDHI adversary B. We obtain a problem instance 1/bP, b ˆP
relative to BG for the problem underlying the assumption in Deﬁnition 28, start
B(BG, 1/bP, b ˆP ) to obtain c = bP , and output e(P, ˆP )b2 ← e(c, b ˆP ) with the
same probability as B outputs bP , i.e., breaks co-CDHI.
