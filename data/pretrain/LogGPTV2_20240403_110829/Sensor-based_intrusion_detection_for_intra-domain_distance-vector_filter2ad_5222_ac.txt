Figure 3: Sensor Detection Example
vertisement for attacks by matching every advertised subnet
against the list of subnets that the sensor has in its conﬁg-
uration. If the sensor does not ﬁnd a match, it declares the
routing advertisement to be malicious.
Next, a routing advertisement is analyzed to determine
whether the advertised cost is optimal, sub-optimal, or im-
possible. An optimal cost is the cost of one of the shortest
paths from a router to a destination advertised by the router.
A sub-optimal cost is the cost of one of the paths from a
router to a destination advertised by the router. This path
may not necessarily be the shortest. An impossible cost is
a cost not associated to any of the paths from a router to
a destination advertised by the router. Unreachability, i.e.,
where the advertised cost is 15, is considered sub-optimal
rather than impossible.
Consider a routing advertisement m, originating from router
vi on link eij, advertising a cost mcab for subnet msab . The
sensor conﬁguration deﬁnes the following costs for reaching
sab from vi:
mcab ∈ {co1
mcab ∈ {cs1

In the above relation, if the link-level and IP source ad-
dresses of routing advertisement m are those of router vi,
then the link-level and IP destination addresses of m should
be those of router vj, the broadcast address of link eij, or
the multicast address of RIP routers. If m has originated
from router vj , the source link-level and IP addresses should
be those of router vj and destination link-level and IP ad-
dresses should be those of router vi, the broadcast address
of link eij, or the multicast address of RIP routers. The
time-to-live ﬁeld of m should be 1. Note that link-level and
network-layer information can be spoofed. Therefore, this
veriﬁcation alone is not enough to conclude that a routing
advertisement is not malicious.
5.2 Distance-Vector Information Veriﬁcation
Routing advertisements for subnets that do not belong
to the local autonomous system indicate that the routing
advertisements are malicious.6 A sensor scans a routing ad-

In distance-vector routing protocols, routing advertisements are
meant for a router’s immediate neighbors only.

Routers running intra-domain routing protocols do not have
routes to every possible subnet. Usually, routes to subnets out-
The above relation states that in a routing advertisement
m, advertised by router vi for subnet sab, the cost mcab is
optimal if it belongs to the set of optimal costs; sub-optimal
if it belongs to the set of sub-optimal costs; impossible if it
does not belong to the set of optimal costs or sub-optimal
costs. Assuming that a sensor has the correct topological
information, an impossible-cost advertisement detected by
the sensor is considered malicious. Better-than-optimal-cost
routing advertisements can be detected by checking the rout-
ing advertisements for impossible-cost advertisements. For
example, consider Figure 3. The costs of all links are equal
to 1. The set of optimal costs that router v2 can advertise
for subnet s45, on link e12, is {3}, using path {(v2, v3, v4)}.
The set of sub-optimal costs that router v2 can advertise for
subnet s45, on link e12, is {5, 6, 6} with paths {(v2, v6, v7, v8,
v4), (v2, v6, v7, v8, v9, v5), (v2, v3, v4, v8, v9, v5)}, respec-
tively. No paths from router v1 are considered, since router
v2 will not advertise any paths that it has learned through
router v1 on link e12. Costs advertised by router v2 on link
e12 for subnet s45 that are not 3, 5, or 6 are impossible costs.
side the autonomous system are only known to the border routers.
Non-border routers use default routes to the border routers for
external subnets.
1315.3 Path Veriﬁcation
The impossible-cost-advertisement veriﬁcation cannot de-
termine the validity of an optimal-cost or sub-optimal-cost
advertisement. A malicious entity can advertise a sub-op-
timal cost to a destination even though the corresponding
optimal-cost path is available for use. For example, in Fig-
ure 3, subnet s45 can be reached at cost 3 from router v2 but
a malicious entity on link e12 can pretend to be router v2 and
advertise cost 6 for subnet s45. This will result in router v1
using router v10, instead of router v2, to send data to subnet
s45. A malicious entity can also advertise an optimal cost
when the optimal-cost path is not available. For example,
in Figure 3, a malicious entity on link e12 can pretend to be
router v2 and advertise cost 3 for subnet s45 when subnet
s45 is no longer reachable using path {(v2, v3, v4)}. In addi-
tion, a malicious entity can subvert a router and conﬁgure
it to drop data packets, or it may impersonate a router after
having disabled the router.

In all the above attacks, the advertised distance-vector
information is correct. Therefore, these attacks cannot be
detected by merely verifying the distance-vector informa-
tion. To detect such attacks, sensors use a path-veriﬁcation
algorithm. Consider sensorij on link eij between routers vi
and vj. If sensorij ﬁnds in a routing advertisement m the

sensor12 on link e12 detects a routing advertisement from
router v2 for subnet s45 at cost 3. Therefore, sensor12
searches its conﬁguration to ﬁnd all paths that have cost 3.
sensor12 ﬁnds that path {(v2, v3, v4)} has cost 3. In its con-
ﬁguration, sensor12 also has the information that for path
{(v2, v3, v4)}, links e34 and e45 have sensor34 and sensor45
on them. To validate the advertisement, sensor12 sends
messages to sensor34 and sensor45. If the advertised cost
had been 5, sensor12 would have sent messages to sensor67,
sensor89 and sensor45.

For example, consider Figure 3. sensor12 detects a rout-
ing advertisement from router v2 for subnet s45 at cost 3.

optimal cost from router v2 to subnet s45. sensor12 ﬁnds
path {(v2, v3, v4)} that has cost 3. Therefore, sensor12 sends
messages to sensors available on this path, i.e., sensor34

sensor34 and sensor45,
it concludes that the path from
router v2 to subnet s45 is unavailable.
If sensor12 gets a
reply from sensor45 but not from sensor34, sensor12 can
conclude that subnet s45 is reachable from router v2 but

sensor34 but not from sensor45, sensor12 cannot be sure if
subnet s45 is reachable from router v2 or not. If sensor12
gets a reply from both sensor34 and sensor45, sensor12 can
be sure that subnet s45 is reachable from router v2. For the
placement of sensors in Figure 3, sensor12 can never be sure
of the complete optimal path from router v2 to subnet s45,
since link e23 does not have a sensor on it.
Assume now that sensor12 detects a routing advertise-
ment from router v2 for subnet s45 at cost 5. The sensor
searches its conﬁguration and ﬁnds 5 to be a sub-optimal
cost from router v2 to subnet s45 and identiﬁes path {(v2,
v6, v7, v8, v4)} as the only path that has cost 5 from router
132v2 to subnet s45.
In addition, the sensor looks for paths
that have costs greater than or equal to the optimal cost
and less than 5. The only such path in this case is the
path having the optimal cost 3. Therefore, sensor12 sends
messages to sensors available on the path having cost 3.
If sensor12 ﬁnds this path unavailable then sensor12 sends
messages to sensors available on the path having cost 5, i.e.,
sensor67, sensor89 and sensor45.
If sensor12 gets replies
from all sensor67, sensor89 and sensor45, then the routing
advertisement for cost 5 is valid. However, it is not possible
to reliably determine if the path having cost 3 is unavailable.
In general, in a hostile environment a sensor can determine
availability of a path to a subnet but it cannot determine its
unavailability. By dropping or rerouting a message from the
requesting sensor or the replying sensor, a malicious entity
can make the requesting sensor believe that a path to a
subnet is unavailable. On the other hand, if a malicious
entity can drop or re-route packets on a path, the path is
unreliable and an unreliable path is as good as not being
available at all.
If sensor12 ﬁnds that the path having cost 3 is available
then it is possible that either the routing advertisement of
cost 5 is malicious or the routing advertisement is due to a
transitory change in the routing conﬁguration. If the routing
advertisement is transitory and the path from v2 to subnet
s45 at cost 3 is available, then v2 should eventually adver-
tise a route to subnet s45 at cost 3. If sensor12 does not
see a routing advertisement at cost 3 then the routing ad-
vertisement at cost 5 is malicious. If sensor12 sees a routing
advertisement at cost 3 then the sensor does not verify the
path having cost 5 any further.
5.4 Timing Veriﬁcation
Routers advertise routing messages at certain intervals of
time. The interval of time at which RIP messages are ad-
vertised is ripinterval. A router can send more than one RIP
message in ripinterval.7 riphigh
threshold is the maximum number
of packets that a sensor should ever see within ripinterval.
A sensor maintains a counter ripi
