## Abstract
As technology scales, the challenge of maintaining reliability in microprocessor design becomes increasingly crucial. Radiation-hardened SRAM (rSRAM) and voltage scaling are promising circuit-level techniques to enhance the soft error robustness of SRAM-based storage cells. However, applying these hardening techniques to all on-chip transistors would result in significant performance and power consumption overheads. This paper proposes a microarchitecture approach that allows for the cost-effective implementation of radiation-hardened key microarchitecture structures (e.g., issue queue and reorder buffer) in Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) processors using soft error robust circuit techniques. Our study demonstrates that the combined use of circuit and microarchitecture techniques achieves attractive trade-offs between reliability, performance, and power.

## 1. Introduction
Technology scaling, characterized by smaller feature sizes, lower supply voltages, and higher device integration, is projected to lead to a rapid increase in the soft error rate (SER) in future high-performance microprocessors. Soft errors, or single-event upsets (SEUs), are caused by high-energy neutron or alpha particle strikes in integrated circuits. These failures are called soft errors because only the data is corrupted, while the circuit itself remains undamaged.

Protection techniques such as parity or ECC have been used in memory and cache designs. However, pipeline structures like the issue queue (IQ) and reorder buffer (ROB) are latency-critical and require frequent single-cycle accesses. Adding protection mechanisms can introduce latency, severely impacting performance. For example, studies have shown that protecting the IQ with ECC can result in up to a 45% performance degradation [1].

Radiation-hardened circuit design, such as rSRAM, which adds two capacitors to a standard SRAM cell, provides increased immunity to soft errors. However, rSRAM introduces additional write latency, suggesting that while it improves soft error reliability, it also incurs a performance penalty. Similarly, increasing the supply voltage reduces the SER, but it also increases power consumption quadratically. Recent studies [6, 7, 8] indicate that a fraction of soft errors can be masked at the microarchitecture level, making such techniques cost-effective solutions.

Although both radiation-hardened circuit designs and microarchitecture techniques have been proposed, there are few studies that effectively integrate them. This paper bridges this gap by proposing a combined approach. Specifically, we focus on enhancing the soft error tolerance of key microarchitecture structures in SMT processors, such as the IQ and ROB, which are particularly susceptible to soft errors due to their role in instruction and thread-level parallelism.

The contributions of this work are:
- We propose an issue queue that combines a part implemented with standard SRAM cells (NIQ) and a part with rSRAM (RIQ). Instructions with ready operands are dispatched to NIQ, while critical instructions are dispatched to RIQ. This approach mitigates soft error vulnerability in NIQ and hides the write latency of RIQ.
- We compare our technique with existing mechanisms, such as 20P_BLOCK [11], FLUSH [12], and an IQ exclusively implemented with rSRAM. Our results show that the combined scheme achieves the most attractive reliability/performance trade-offs.
- We observe that the ROB's soft error vulnerability increases during L2 cache misses. To address this, we propose scaling up the ROB supply voltage during high vulnerability periods and switching back to nominal voltage after the miss is resolved. This scheme improves ROB reliability with minimal power overhead.
- We evaluate the aggregate effect of the proposed techniques on the entire processor core, showing a 20% reduction in core vulnerability.

## 2. Background: Circuit and Microarchitecture Level Techniques for Soft Error Robustness

### 2.1. Soft Error Robust SRAM (rSRAM)
The soft error rate (SER) of a single SRAM cell can be modeled as:
\[ \text{SER}_{\text{SRAM}} = F \cdot (A_{d,p} + A_{d,n}) \cdot K \cdot e^{-\frac{Q_{\text{crit}}}{Q_s}} \]
where \( F \) is the total neutron flux, \( A_{d,p} \) and \( A_{d,n} \) are the p-type and n-type drain diffusion areas, \( K \) is a fitting parameter, \( Q_{\text{crit}} \) is the critical charge, and \( Q_s \) is the charge collection efficiency. The critical charge \( Q_{\text{crit}} \) depends on the supply voltage \( V_{DD} \), the effective capacitance \( C \), and the charge collection waveform.

To reduce the SER, rSRAM adds two stacked capacitors to a standard six-transistor SRAM cell, increasing the critical charge required to flip the cell state. This results in a much lower SER, but at the cost of slower write operations.

### 2.2. Voltage Scaling for SRAM Soft Error Robustness
Increasing the supply voltage linearly increases the critical charge \( Q_{\text{crit}} \), thereby providing immunity to soft errors. However, this also increases dynamic and leakage power consumption. Dual-voltage techniques can selectively adjust the supply voltage to achieve a balance between power and reliability.

### 2.3. Microarchitecture Vulnerability Analysis
At the microarchitecture level, a SEU may not affect program execution if it does not alter the architecturally correct state. The overall hardware structure's soft error rate (SER) is given by:
\[ \text{SER} = \text{FIT} \cdot \text{AVF} \]
where FIT is the raw SER at the circuit level, and AVF (Architecture Vulnerability Factor) is the probability that a fault in the hardware structure will lead to incorrect program results. The AVF is determined by the average bandwidth and lifetime of the ACE (Architecturally Correct Execution) bits.

## 3. Proposed Hybrid Circuit and Microarchitecture Techniques for Soft Error Robustness

### 3.1. Issue Queue (IQ) Design
We propose an IQ that combines a part implemented with standard SRAM cells (NIQ) and a part with rSRAM (RIQ). Instructions with ready operands are dispatched to NIQ, while critical instructions are dispatched to RIQ. This approach mitigates soft error vulnerability in NIQ and hides the write latency of RIQ.

### 3.2. Reorder Buffer (ROB) Design
We observe that the ROB's soft error vulnerability increases during L2 cache misses. To address this, we propose scaling up the ROB supply voltage during high vulnerability periods and switching back to nominal voltage after the miss is resolved. This scheme improves ROB reliability with minimal power overhead.
