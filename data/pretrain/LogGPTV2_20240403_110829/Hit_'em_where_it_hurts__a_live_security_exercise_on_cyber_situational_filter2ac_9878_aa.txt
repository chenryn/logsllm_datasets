ABSTRACT
Live security exercises are a powerful educational tool to
motivate students to excel and foster research and develop-
ment of novel security solutions. Our insight is to design
a live security exercise to provide interesting datasets in a
speciﬁc area of security research. In this paper we validated
this insight, and we present the design of a novel kind of live
security competition centered on the concept of Cyber Situ-
ational Awareness. The competition was carried out in De-
cember 2010, and involved 72 teams (900 students) spread
across 16 countries, making it the largest educational live
security exercise ever performed. We present both the inno-
vative design of this competition and the novel dataset we
collected. In addition, we deﬁne Cyber Situational Aware-
ness metrics to characterize the toxicity and eﬀectiveness of
the attacks performed by the participants with respect to
the missions carried out by the targets of the attack.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, security attacks have become increasingly
wide-spread and sophisticated. These attacks are made pos-
sible by vulnerable software, poorly conﬁgured systems, and
a lack of security awareness and education of end users.
While a large portion of the security research eﬀorts are
focused on developing novel mechanisms and policies to de-
tect, block, and/or prevent security attacks, there is also
the need for the development of novel approaches to edu-
cate those who create the computer infrastructure, as well
as those who use it everyday.
This is an often-overlooked aspect of computer security,
but a critical one. Almost all sophisticated, widely deployed,
security mechanisms can be made useless by luring an unsus-
pecting user (or a developer) into performing actions that,
eventually, will compromise the security of their environ-
ment. A clear example of the popularity of these attacks
is the proliferation of fake anti-virus scams, in which users
who are not technically savvy are conned into installing a
Trojan application [17].

Security education can be performed at diﬀerent levels to
reach diﬀerent segments, from everyday Internet users, to
high school students, to undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents. Recently, competition-based educational tools have
become popular in graduate and undergraduate education,
as competition among students fosters creativity, innovation,
and the desire to excel.
Previous work has described traditional “capture the ﬂag
competitions” [19, 20], and, more recently, new designs for
this type of competition [2]. The development of new de-
signs improved the competition and forced the participants
to analyze and understand unfamiliar, complex sets of inter-
dependent components, similar to those that are part of real-
life networks and malware infrastructures.
Our novel insight is that these competitions, can, in addi-
tion to their educational value, provide interesting datasets
that can be used in research. To validate this idea we de-
signed and developed a novel security competition based on
the concept of Cyber Situational Awareness (described in
Section 2). The competition is called the iCTF (interna-
tional Capture the Flag) and was carried out on December
3rd, 2010, involving 72 teams and 900 students, making it
the largest live educational security exercise ever performed.
This paper presents the design of the competition, the
data that was collected, and the lessons learned. The data
is the ﬁrst publicly available dataset that explicitly supports
research in Cyber Situational Awareness.
In summary, this paper adds the following contributions:
• We describe the design and implementation of a novel
computer security competition, whose goal is to not
just foster computer security education, but to create
a Cyber Situational Awareness dataset.
• We analyze the collected dataset and discuss its use
in Cyber Situational Awareness research, introducing
a novel metric that characterizes the eﬀectiveness of
attacks with respect to a speciﬁc mission.
• We discuss the lessons learned from the competition,
and we provide suggestions to other educators that
might implement similar competitions.
2. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY
In this section, we provide background on two of the most
important aspects of this paper: the design and execution of
live security competitions, and the concepts associated with
Cyber Situational Awareness.
2.1 Live Security Competitions
Security challenges have been a way to attract the in-
terest of security researchers, practitioners, and students.
Live security challenges add a real-time factor that supports
deeper involvement and introduces the “crisis factor” associ-
ated with many real-life security problems: “something bad
is happening right now and has to be taken care of.”
There have been a number of live security challenges,
but the best-known competition is DefCon’s Capture The
Flag (CTF). This competition started with a simple design,
where a host with vulnerable services was made available to
the participants, who would attack the target concurrently.
Whoever was able to break a service and steal the ﬂag ﬁrst,
obtained the points associated with that service. The origi-
nal design was changed in 2002. In this edition of DefCon’s
CTF, the participating teams received an identical copy of
a virtualized system containing a number of vulnerable ser-
vices. Each team ran their virtual machine on a virtual
private network (VPN), with the goal of maintaining the
service’s availability and integrity whilst concurrently com-
promising the other teams’ services. Since each team had
exactly the same copy of the services, the participants had
to analyze the services, ﬁnd the vulnerabilities, patch their
own copies, and break into the other teams’ services and
steal the associated ﬂags. Every other DefCon CTF follow-
ing 2002 used more or less the same design [4].
Even though DefCon’s CTF was designed to test the skills
of hackers and security professionals, it was clear that the
same type of competition could be used as an educational
tool. One of the major diﬀerences between the iCTF and
DefCon’s CTF is that the iCTF involves educational insti-
tutions spread out across the world, where the DefCon CTF
allows only locally-connected teams. Therefore, DefCon re-
quires the physical co-location of the contestants thus con-
straining participation to a limited number of teams. By
providing remote access, the iCTF allows dozens of remotely
located teams to compete.
The iCTF editions from 2003 to 2007 were similar to
the DefCon CTF: the participants had to protect and at-
tack a virtualized system containing vulnerable services [20].
In 2008 and 2009, two new designs were introduced:
in
2008, the competition was designed as a “treasure hunt,”
where the participants had to sequentially break into a se-
ries of hosts; in 2009, the competition focused on drive-by-
download attacks, and the targets were a large pool of vul-
nerable browsers [2]. The iCTF inspired other educational
hacking competitions, e.g., CIPHER [12] and RuCTF [18].
Recently, a diﬀerent type of competition has received a
signiﬁcant amount of attention. In the Pwn2Own hacking
challenge [13] participants try to compromise the security
of various up-to-date computer devices such as laptops and
smart phones. Whoever successfully compromises a device,
wins the device itself as a prize. This competition is solely
focused on attack, does not have an educational focus, and
does not allow any real interaction amongst the participants
who attack a single target in parallel.
Another interesting competition is the Cyber Defense Ex-
ercise (CDX) [1,10,14], in which a number of military schools
compete in protecting their networks from external attack-
ers. This competition diﬀers from the UCSB iCTF in a
number of ways. First, the competition’s sole focus is on
defense. Second, the competition is scored in person by hu-
man evaluators who observe the activity of the participants,
and score them according to their ability to react to attacks.
This evaluation method is subjective and requires a human
judge for each team thus rendering it impractical in a large-
scale on-line security competition.
The 2010 iCTF diﬀered from the 2009 iCTF [2] in the
following way: we realized that a live security exercise could
be structured to create a dataset to enable security research.
We utilized this idea in the 2010 iCTF by creating a Cyber
Situational Awareness security competition that would gen-
erate a useful Cyber Situational Awareness dataset.
2.2 Cyber Situational Awareness
Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) is an extension of
traditional Situational Awareness (SA) to computer net-
works. The idea behind SA is that by analyzing the sur-
rounding environment and putting perceived events into the
context of the current mission,
it is possible to improve
decision-making. In the cyber-world, the concept of Situa-
tional Awareness includes the concept of mission awareness,
which is the analysis of network events with respect to the
mission being carried out by a particular organization.
One of the most important ideas behind CSA is that not
all attacks have the same impact. The relevance of an attack
is determined by the importance of the target with respect
to a speciﬁc mission and a speciﬁc moment in time. For
example, an attack against an FTP server could be harmless
if the server is not a necessary component for the currently
executing mission(s) in the next, say, eight hours, because
within that time frame the server could be ﬁxed/cleaned
and it could be available when needed.
Instead, consider
an attack against a VoIP router when a strategic meeting
must use that particular piece of infrastructure. The attack
will directly impact the mission being carried out, and might
impose delays or cause the mission to fail.
There are several challenges in CSA. First of all, it is dif-
ﬁcult to correctly model missions. In many cases, organi-
zations and companies are not even aware of their cyber-
missions. Usually, identifying cyber-missions is easier in en-
vironments where repetitive tasks are performed cyclically.
For example, banks have well-deﬁned missions with tasks
that must be carried out in speciﬁc sequences (e.g., closing
balances, reconcile balance sheets) and must be performed
within a certain time limit (e.g., midnight of the current
day). Another example is military systems, where cycles
of observation/analysis/operation phases are carefully fol-
lowed, with precise time frames and clear dependencies.
In all these cases, one must choose a particular format
to precisely describe a mission. A simple solution is to use
Gantt charts [3], which clearly represent the duration and
dependency of diﬀerent tasks. For the cyber-missions de-
scribed in this paper, we used Missionary, a Petri net [11]
based formalism we created which extends the basic Petri
net model with timing and code fragments associated with
transitions and states. In this formalism, the tasks are rep-
resented by the states of the Petri net. A token in a state
characterizes an active instance of the task. A task termi-
nates when a token is removed from the corresponding state
as a side-eﬀect of the ﬁring of a transition. Analogously, a
task starts when a token is created in a state as the side-
eﬀect of the ﬁring of a transition. Peterson [11] has a detailed
description of Petri nets and their extensions.
Another challenge in CSA is to represent the dependency
between cyber-missions and both the human actors and as-
sets involved in the missions [5]. For the sake of simplicity
we do not address the former. For the latter, we used Mis-
sionary’s service composition formalism, which allows the
association of diﬀerent types of service compositions to a
task in a mission. In a nutshell, the formalism allowed us
to specify services that were associated with a state in the
Petri net, thus creating an association between a mission
task and the services necessary to carry out the task.

2010 iCTF
The iCTF competition was held on December 3rd, 2010,
and lasted from 09:00 until 17:00, PST.
3.1 Pre-competition setup
Registration for the iCTF competition began a month be-
fore the start date. Attempting to alleviate the VPN connec-
tion problems that can occur on the day of the competition,
we distributed a VMware [21] image along with VPN con-
nection instructions to each team 11 days before the compe-
tition. The VMware image was meant as an example of the
type of VMware image that would be used for the competi-
tion. We took particular care in making sure that the teams
solved their connectivity problems well in advance, so that
they could focus on the competition.
3.2 Story
The theme of the iCTF competition was “Mission aware-
ness in state-sponsored cyberwar.” The following text was
given to the teams the day before the competition:
The country of Litya has become a major center
for illegal activities of all kinds. The country is
ruled by the ruthless dictator Lisvoy Bironulesk,
who has pioneered the use of large malware in-
frastructures in order to support Litya’s econ-
omy. Recently, he has claimed that Litya has “a
botnet in every country.”
His complete disregard for international laws,
his support of banking fraud and phishing scams,
together with his well-known taste for underage
girls has ﬁnally brought the attention of the in-
ternational community into his shady dealings.
Enough is enough. Now, the aﬀected nations
have decided to strike back. Spies who inﬁltrated
Litya’s corrupt administration have leaked plans
of the most critical missions carried out in the
country. These plans appear to describe the vari-
ous activities of each mission, their ordering and
timing, and their dependency on particular ser-
vices.
In this scenario, each team represented a country with the
common goal of dismantling Litya’s infrastructure, thus end-
ing Bironulesk’s reign. In addition to this text, the teams
were given a number of images that described the various
“missions” carried out by Litya. One of the missions is shown
in Figure 1.
3.3 Competition Description
At a high level, the competition was designed to force the
teams to exploit services at speciﬁc times, when they are
most needed by Litya, thus emulating a Cyber Situational
Awareness scenario. The teams had to access the services,
ﬁrst by bribing Litya’s administrators, then by keeping their
VMware image connected to a “mothership.” If the teams
generated an intrusion detection system alert, they were
blocked from the network for a ﬁxed amount of time.
Scoring
3.3.1
There were two types of scores: money and points. The
team with the highest points won the competition, thus
points were more important than money. Points were ac-
quired by exploiting services at the correct time. However,
if a team did not have any money, they would be shut oﬀ
from the network and not be able to score any points. In
addition to starting the competition with 1000 in money and
zero points, each team earned money by solving challenges.
3.3.2 Firewall and IDS
A substantial innovation introduced in the iCTF was cre-
ating an intrusion prevention system (IPS) by connecting the
Snort [16] intrusion detection system to the ﬁrewall. If Snort
detected an intrusion attempt (alert) from a team on traf-
ﬁc directed towards Litya’s services, the oﬀending team was
shut oﬀ from the network for ten minutes. The team would
