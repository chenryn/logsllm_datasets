Mozilla Firefox’s primary warning could reduce their
clickthrough rates even further for some errors.
8 Conclusion
We performed a ﬁeld study with Google Chrome and
Mozilla Firefox’s telemetry platforms, allowing us to col-
lect data on 25,405,944 warning impressions. We ﬁnd
that browser security warnings can be successful: users
clicked through fewer than a quarter of both browser’s
malware and phishing warnings and a third of Mozilla
Firefox’s SSL warnings. We also ﬁnd clickthrough rates
as high as 70.2% for Google Chrome SSL warnings, in-
dicating that the user experience of a warning can have a
tremendous impact on user behavior. However, warning
effectiveness varies between demographic groups. Our
ﬁndings motivate more work on browser security warn-
ings, with particular attention paid to demographics. At
Google, we have begun experimenting with new warning
designs to further improve our warnings.
7.3 Demographics
We found that clickthrough rates differ by operating sys-
tem and browser channel. Our ﬁndings suggest that higher
technical skill (as indicated by use of Linux and pre-
release channels) may predispose users to click through
some types of warnings. We recommend further inves-
tigation of user demographics and their impact on user
behavior. Large-scale demographic studies might uncover
additional demographic factors that we were unable to
study with our methodology. If so, can warning design
address and overcome those demographic differences?
Technically advanced users might feel more conﬁdent
in the security of their computers, be more curious about
blocked websites, or feel patronized by warnings. Studies
of these users could help improve their warning responses.
7.4 Number of Clicks
Our data suggests that the amount of effort (i.e., number
of clicks) required to bypass a warning does not always
have a large impact on user behavior. To bypass Google
Chrome’s malware and phishing warnings, the user must
click twice: once on a small “Advanced” link, and then
again to “proceed.” Despite the hidden button, users click
through Google Chrome’s malware/phishing warning at a
higher rate than Mozilla Firefox’s simpler warning. Fur-
thermore, 84% of users who open Mozilla Firefox’s “Add
Exception” dialog proceed through it.
We ﬁnd this result surprising. Common wisdom in
e-commerce holds that extra clicks decrease clickthrough
rates (hence, one-click shopping) [12, 32]. Google
Chrome’s warning designers introduced the extra step in
the malware/phishing warning because they expected it
to serve as a strong deterrent. One possible explanation is
that users make a single cognitive decision when faced
with a warning. The decision might be based on the URL,
warning appearance, or warning message. Once the user
has decided to proceed, additional clicks or information
is unlikely to change his or her decision.
Our data suggests that browser-warning designers
should not rely on extra clicks to deter users. However,
we did not explicitly design our study to examine the
effects of multiple clicks. Future studies on multi-click
warnings could shed light on user decision models and
impact security warning design. It is possible that extra
clicks do not serve as a deterrent until they reach some
threshold of difﬁculty.
7.5 Warning Fatigue
We observed behavior that is consistent with the theory of
warning fatigue. In Google Chrome, users click through
the most common SSL error faster and more frequently
