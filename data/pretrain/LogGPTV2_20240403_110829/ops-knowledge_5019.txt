To effectively implement CIS Control 12.6, which focuses on the use of secure network management and communication protocols, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Adopt Secure Protocols:**
   - Utilize robust network management and communication protocols such as 802.1X for port-based network access control.
   - Implement Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) Enterprise or a more advanced version (e.g., WPA3) to ensure secure wireless communication.

2. **Configuration and Management:**
   - Ensure that all network devices are configured to use these secure protocols.
   - Regularly update and patch network devices to protect against known vulnerabilities.

3. **Access Control:**
   - Enforce strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), for network management interfaces.
   - Limit access to network management functions to authorized personnel only.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Enable logging and monitoring of network management activities to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
   - Regularly review logs to identify and address any security incidents or anomalies.

5. **Policy and Documentation:**
   - Develop and maintain clear policies and procedures for the use of secure network management and communication protocols.
   - Provide training and awareness programs for staff to ensure they understand and adhere to these policies.

CIS Control 12.6 is categorized under the asset type "Network" and falls under the security function "Protect." By following these procedures, organizations can significantly enhance their network security and protect against potential threats.
