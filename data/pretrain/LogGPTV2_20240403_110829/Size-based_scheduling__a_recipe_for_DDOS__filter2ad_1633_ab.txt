### 2.1.2 Case Study 2: Ordinary Bandwidth Attacks

In ordinary bandwidth attacks, the attacker's traffic does not necessarily need to satisfy Equation 3, as the goal may be to degrade the router's performance rather than completely shutting it down. The attacker relies on the combined effect of the attack traffic and the legitimate traffic to overload the router, leading to service degradation for legitimate traffic.

Under LAS (or any SBS scheduler), during periods of overload, the lowest priority packets are dropped first. For an attacker using the Mice mechanism, all attack packets are assigned the highest priority because each attack flow uses only a few packets. Therefore, in regular bandwidth attacks conducted this way, it is the legitimate flows that experience packet losses when the link becomes overloaded, as most of their packets are considered low-priority. Even when the link is only moderately loaded, legitimate flows still see increased delays due to their low-priority packets being queued.

Since TCP adjusts its sending rate based on delays and loss events, we hypothesize that for a DDoS attack using high-priority packets, any attack traffic rate will cause more significant performance degradation under LAS compared to FIFO, where delays and losses would not be restricted to just the legitimate flows.

To validate this hypothesis, we simulated a simple dumbbell topology where 1000 UDP attack sources targeted a 155 Mbps (OC3) link, which was also traversed by 50 legitimate flows. To implement spoofing of attack packets, we designed a variant of the UDP traffic agent that set the sequence numbers of all generated packets to zero, creating the illusion that each packet was the first packet of a flow. Note that in ns2, UDP packets have sequence numbers, and the ns2 LAS implementation uses these sequence numbers to determine the age of the flow to which the packet belongs.

Figure 2(a) shows that when the DDoS attack was launched at t=500s, the studied TCP flow had its throughput reduced to zero at the LAS router, while it retained about a third of its mean throughput under FIFO scheduling (Figure 2(b)). The attack traffic rate was equal to the router line rate (155 Mbps), and the total link load before the attack was 30% of the link capacity.

Figure 3(a) illustrates the relationship between the attack traffic load and the throughput reduction for one of the legitimate flows in another set of experiments. Before the attacks were launched, the load due to the legitimate flows was 90% of the link capacity. This heavy load was chosen to simulate a busy link being attacked. The results confirmed that LAS suffered more severe throughput degradation than FIFO for all attack traffic rates.

In the experiments on HTTP traffic, the Web traffic model from [5] was used. Clients downloaded web pages from randomly selected websites, with each page containing several objects. The object sizes followed a Pareto distribution with a shape parameter of 1.2, and the inter-page and inter-object time distributions were exponential with means of 9 seconds and 1 millisecond, respectively. While the Web transfers were occurring, the access router to the servers was bombarded with Mice DDoS traffic at a rate equal to 60% of the link capacity (the same as the load before the attack). During the attack, we measured and averaged the response times for different-sized objects, normalizing them relative to the response times without DDoS. Figure 3(b) confirms the earlier observation that LAS suffers worse degradation than FIFO under DDoS.

### 3. Conclusion

We have exposed a security weakness in SBS. Our work complements the general understanding of SBS and stimulates research on the design of secure SBS schemes.
