2.1.2 Case Study 2: Ordinary Bandwidth Attacks
During ordinary bandwidth attacks, the attacker’s traﬃc
needn’t necessarily satisfy Equation 3, since the aim may be
degradation of a router’s performance, as opposed to com-
pletely shutting down the router. The attacker depends on
the combination of the attack traﬃc load, and the load of-
fered by legitimate traﬃc to cause a router overload, which
in turn causes service degradation to legitimate traﬃc.
Under LAS (or any SBS scheduler), during times of over-
load, its the lowest priority packets which are dropped. For
an attacker using the Mice mechanism, all attack packets
have the highest priority (since each attack-ﬂow uses only
a few packets). Hence for regular bandwidth attacks con-
ducted in this way, it is the legitimate ﬂows which see losses
when the link gets overloaded, since most of their packets are
seen as low priority packets. In cases when the link is only
moderately loaded, it is still the legitimate ﬂows which see
increased delays, since their low priority packets are queued.
Since TCP uses delays and loss events to set its sending rate,
we conjecture that for a DDOS attack using priority pack-
ets, any attack-traﬃc rate causes more performance degra-
dation under LAS than under FIFO where the delays and
losses would not be restricted to only the legitimate ﬂows.
To verify this argument, we simulated a simple dumbbell
topology in which 1000 UDP attack sources bombarded a
155Mbps (OC3) link which was also being traversed by 50
legitimate ﬂows. To implement spooﬁng of attack packets,
we designed a variant of the UDP traﬃc agent in which se-
quence numbers for all generated packets were always zero,
to create the illusion of each packet being the ﬁrst packet of
a ﬂow. Note that in ns2, UDP packets also have sequence
numbers, and the ns2 LAS implementation uses the packet
sequence number to determine the age of the ﬂow to which
the packet belongs. Figure 2(a) shows that when the DDOS

attack was launched at t=500s, the studied TCP ﬂow had its
throughput reduced to zero at the LAS router, yet it retained
about a third of its mean throughput when the scheduling
policy was FIFO (Figure 2(b)). The attack traﬃc rate was
equal to the router line rate (155 Mbps), and the total link
load before attack was 30 % of the link capacity. Figure 3(a)

Figure 3: Eﬀects of DDOS on TCP traﬃc
other set of experiments. Before the attacks were launched,
the load due to the legitimate ﬂows was 90% of the link
capacity. This choice of heavy load was meant to simulate
a scenario of a busy link being attacked. Results conﬁrmed
that LAS suﬀered more severe throughput degradation than
FIFO for all attack traﬃc rates.
In the experiments on HTTP traﬃc, the Web traﬃc model
in [5] was used. Clients downloaded web pages from ran-
domly selected web sites, with each page containing several
objects. The object sizes followed a Pareto distribution with
shape parameter 1.2, and the inter-page and inter-object
time distributions were exponential with means 9 seconds
and 1 milli seconds respectively. While the Web transfers
were occuring, the access router to the servers was bom-
barded with Mice DDOS traﬃc at a rate equal to 60% of
the link capacity (same as the load before attack). During
the attack, we measured and averaged the response times
for diﬀerent sized objects, before normalizing them out of
the response times seen without DDOS. Figure 3(b) shows
the results, which conﬁrm the earlier observation of LAS
suﬀering worse degradation than FIFO under DDOS.
3. CONCLUSION
We have exposed a security weakness of SBS. Our work
compliments the general understanding of SBS and stimu-
lates research on the design of secure SBS schemes.
