**Issue: Receiving HTTP 403 Error When Accessing ASP.NET Website from Remote Client**

I have developed an ASP.NET website that should be accessible from client browsers within the same domain. The site is hosted on IIS 7.5, and I have configured the following settings:

- **Authentication Settings:**
  - Disabled Anonymous Authentication
  - Enabled Windows Authentication (from the Features View under the IIS section)

- **Web.config Configuration:**
  ```xml
  <authorization>
    <allow users="group\BizTalk Application Users" />
    <deny users="?" />
  </authorization>
  ```

**Current Behavior:**
- The website can be accessed successfully from a browser running on the server that hosts the site.
- However, when attempting to access the site from a different server in the same domain using the same credentials, I receive an HTTP 403 error.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Disabling Security:**
   - I disabled Windows Authentication and enabled Anonymous Authentication, but the 403 error persists.
   - Checked the IIS logs and found that the sub-status code for the 403 error is 18.

2. **Fiddler Trace:**
   - **Request:**
     ```http
     GET http://tst-bts01/Vasanta.Int.SEOPSupportApp/Orders.aspx HTTP/1.1
     Accept: image/jpeg, image/gif, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-application, application/xaml+xml, application/x-ms-xbap, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/msword, */*
     Accept-Language: en-GB
     User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)
     Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
     Connection: Keep-Alive
     Host: tst-bts01
     ```
   - **Response:**
     ```http
     HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
     Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
     X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
     Date: Tue, 29 Jan 2013 10:24:34 GMT
     Content-Length: 0
     ```

3. **Additional Troubleshooting:**
   - Changed the application pool hosting the site.
   - Disabled the corporate proxy (ISA server).

**Questions:**
- What might be causing this issue?
- Are there any additional steps or configurations I should consider?

**Note:**
- The web server logs are located in `%SYSTEMDIR%\LogFiles\`.
- The sub-status error code 18 indicates a specific type of 403 error, which is detailed on the Microsoft support website.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Rob
