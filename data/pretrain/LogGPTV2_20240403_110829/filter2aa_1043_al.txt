### Test Setup and Procedure

To evaluate the performance of the receivers under multiple undesired signals, the following test setup and procedure were employed. Please refer to Figure 1 for the laboratory setup.

#### Test Setup
- **Desired Signal Level**: The desired DTV signal was set at -68 dBm.
- **Undesired Signals**: Two undesired DTV channels (U1 and U2) were used to create intermodulation products.
- **Interference Levels**: The level of interference (D/U) at the threshold of visibility (TOV) was measured for both single and multiple undesired signals.

#### Test Procedure
1. **Single Undesired Signal Testing**:
   - Each undesired DTV signal (U1 and U2) was tested individually.
   - The D/U ratio at TOV was recorded for each undesired signal.

2. **Multiple Undesired Signals Testing**:
   - Both undesired signals (U1 and U2) were combined with the desired signal and connected to the receiver under test.
   - The level of one of the undesired DTV signals (U1) was reduced by 3 dB based on the results from step 1.
   - The D/U ratio at TOV for the other undesired DTV signal (U2) was then recorded.

#### Scenarios Tested
- **N-1 and N+1 into DTV**
- **N-2 and N+2 into DTV**
- **N-3 and N+3 into DTV**
- **N-4 and N+3 into DTV**

#### Signal Filtering
- **Filtered Signal**: The undesired signal (U1) used in these tests was filtered according to FCC specifications.
- **Unfiltered Signal**: Testing with unfiltered signals was not conducted. Generally, using a filtered signal could reduce the measured D/U ratios and potentially increase the performance degradation observed.

### Results

The following tables summarize the D/U ratios for the different test conditions. The degradation in performance is also noted when multiple undesired signals are present.
