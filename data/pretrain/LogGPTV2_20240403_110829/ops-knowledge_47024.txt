User: I am using GAE with python and I can ask users to sign in with Google using:
loginURL = (users.create_login_url(self.request.path))
This gives me a link that lets users sign in and get redirected to my site.
However some users do not have a Google ID,
Is there any way to let them sign up for one and be redirected to my site?
I know there is no:
signupURL = (users.create_signup_url(self.request.path))
That is the kind of thing I am looking for, asking the user to sign up and have her quickly redirected when she is done.
Thank you very much for any insight.
Assistant: When your user goes to the login url, there is a red SIGN UP button on the top.  They can go sign up there.
It took me a second to find too, unfortunately you can't change the login page.
