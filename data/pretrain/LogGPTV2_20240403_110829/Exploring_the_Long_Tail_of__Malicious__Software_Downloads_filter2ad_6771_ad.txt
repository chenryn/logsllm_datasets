### Table 9: Top Signers That Exclusively Signed Benign or Malicious Files

We also investigated file packers. Our analysis revealed that both benign and malicious files were equally packed, with 54% of the benign files and 58% of the malicious files processed using known packing software. Similar to signers, many packers are used to concurrently pack both benign and malicious software. Out of the 69 unique packers in our collection, more than half (35) are used in both cases. For example, INNO, UPX, and AutoIt are commonly used for both types of files. This makes detection systems that rely solely on packing information less accurate. Among the packers exclusively used for malicious files, we observed Molebox, NSPack, and Themida. Additionally, a simple breakdown of packers per type of malicious file does not reveal any discriminating factor, as they are commonly packed by similar software.

### 5. Downloading Processes and Machines

In this section, we study the types of files downloaded by different processes. We aim to answer questions such as: What categories of processes (e.g., browsers, Windows processes, etc.) contribute more to malicious downloads? What files are typically downloaded by benign software?

#### 5.1. Analysis of Benign Processes That Download Executables

For our first measurements, we focus on different categories of file download processes. We group client processes into five broad classes: browsers, Windows processes, Java processes (i.e., Java runtime environment software), Acrobat Reader processes, and all other processes. Java and Acrobat Reader processes are considered separately because these software applications are notoriously vulnerable and have been exploited by malware distributors in the past (e.g., via exploit kits like Nuclear, Fiesta, or Angler).

To label a process, we use the name of the executable file from which the process was launched. For example, any process with the name `firefox.exe` is labeled as the Firefox web browser. We compiled a list of different file names observed for each process category. We also accounted for the fact that malware may disguise itself as a legitimate process. Therefore, our measurements focused only on the download behavior of known benign processes whose related executable file hash matched our whitelist.

**Table 10: Download Behavior of Benign Processes (Divided by Process Category)**

| Process Category | Distinct Process Versions | Machines | Executable Files Downloaded | Infected Machines | Malware Type Distribution |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Browsers         | 587                       | 429,593  | 368,925                     | 23,059            | dropper=28.05%, pup=18.55%, trojan=10.48%, adware=7.36%, fakeav=0.35%, ransomware=0.27%, banker=0.23%, bot=0.22%, worm=0.05%, spyware=0.03% (undefined=34.43%) |
| Windows Processes | 24.44%                    | 27.71%   | 173                         | 2,977             | 227                       | 25                        | 488                      | trojan=45.29%, bot=15.78%, dropper=12.30%, banker=6.97%, ransomware=4.30%, pup=1.02%, worm=0.82% (undefined=12.54%) |
| Java             | 9                         | 1,080    | 264                         | 0                 | 696                       | 78.52%                    | trojan=39.51%, dropper=23.71%, banker=15.80%, bot=8.19%, ransomware=3.74%, fakeav=1.44%, spyware=0.43%, worm=0.29% (undefined=6.89%) |
| Acrobat Reader   | 8,714                     | 112,681  | 68,334                      | 5,642             | 15,440                    | 31.24%                    | pup=22.57%, dropper=17.22%, trojan=11.34%, adware=8.38%, fakeav=5.03%, banker=1.20%, bot=0.79%, ransomware=0.44%, worm=0.30%, spyware=0.02% (undefined=32.71%) |
| All Other Processes | -                       | -        | -                           | -                 | -                         | -                         |

From Table 10, it is evident that most files downloaded by Java and Acrobat Reader are malicious and cause the downloading machines to become infected. Specifically, of the 1,080 machines that ran an instance of Acrobat Reader, 78.52% downloaded and executed at least one of the 696 malicious files, thus becoming infected. None of the executable files downloaded by Acrobat Reader processes could be labeled as benign, and 264 files remained unknown but are likely malicious.

Similarly, Java processes mostly download malicious files. The 25 benign downloads shown in Table 10 appear to be outliers, which we investigated closely. These turned out to be legitimate bundled software like Java applets for sound recording or custom calendars.

Windows system processes can also initiate the download (and execution) of new malicious files. We only consider known benign processes. The malicious downloads are likely due to these processes being exploited (either remotely or locally). The number of affected machines is significant. Of the 429,593 machines on which a Windows process initiated an executable file download, 27.71% downloaded and executed at least one of the 68,767 malicious files, suggesting that many Windows machines run unpatched processes, leading to infection.

As expected, web browsers initiated the majority of web-based executable file downloads. Table 11 reports the number and type of files downloaded by popular browsers. Surprisingly, Internet Explorer (IE) appears to be the "safest" browser based on the percentage of malicious downloads and infected machines. Of the 411,138 machines that used IE to download one or more executable files, only 18% became infected. In contrast, of the 344,994 machines using Chrome, 31.92% became infected, the highest rate among popular browsers. These results are based on known malicious files, and the large number of unknown file downloads by both Chrome and IE could affect the results if complete ground truth were available. Nonetheless, known malicious software affects more Chrome users than IE users.

**Table 11: Download Behavior of Benign Browser Processes**

| Browser  | Processes | Machines | Unknown Files | Benign Files | Malicious Files | Infected Machines | Infection Rate |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Firefox  | 378       | 86,104   | 1,762         | 4,749        | 17,623          | 534               | 26.00%         |
| Chrome   | 528       | 104,237  | 4,749         | 2,579        | 7,411           | 117               | 31.92%         |
| Opera    | 91        | 344,994  | 21,443        | 73,806       | 1,567           | 422               | 27.83%         |
| Safari   | 17        | 460,214  | 13,801        | 48,206       | 73              | 164               | 18.56%         |
| IE       | 307       | 4,337    | 411,138       | 561,769      | 13,801          | 48,206            | 18.09%         |

From Table 10, we see that droppers are the most common malicious file type (excluding undefined files) downloaded by browsers. Droppers are first-stage malware used to download additional malware once the machine is infected. This observation aligns with the results in Table 6, showing that 85.6% of droppers have a valid software signature, likely used to evade malware defenses and persuade users to run the software.

#### 5.2. Analysis of Malicious Processes

To extend our experiments, we analyzed the download behavior of malicious processes. We categorized malicious processes by their malware types and demonstrated what is typically downloaded by each type. Table 12 has a similar structure to Table 10 but explores different malware types. The "Processes" column reports the number of processes associated with each malware type.

**Table 12: Download Behavior of Malicious Processes**

| Malware Type | Processes | Machines | Downloaded Files | Unknown | Benign | Malware | Malware Type Distribution |
|--------------|-----------|----------|------------------|---------|--------|---------|---------------------------|

These findings provide insights into the behavior of different types of malicious processes and the files they typically download, helping to improve detection and mitigation strategies.
