Table 9. Top signers that exclusively signed benign or malicious files
We also investigated file packers. Interestingly, our analysis found that downloaded benign and malicious 
files were equally packed, with 54% of the benign files and 58% of the malicious files found processed 
with  a  known  packing  software.  Similar  to  the  signers,  many  packers  are  used  to  concurrently  pack 
both  benign  and  malicious  software:  out  of  69  unique  packers  adopted  by  our  collection  of  software 
downloads, more than half of them (35) are equally used in both benign and malicious cases. For example, 
we observed many benign and malicious files that are packed by INNO, UPX, AutoIt, etc. This makes 
detection  systems  that  solely  rely  on  packing  information  fall  short  in  terms  of  accuracy.  Among  the 
packers that are exclusively used on malicious files, we observed Molebox, NSPack, and Themida, for 
example.  In  addition,  a  simple  breakdown  of  packers  per  type  of  malicious  files  does  not  reveal  any 
discriminating factor among them because the files appear to be commonly packed by similar software.

5. Downloading Processes 
and Machines
In this section, we study the type of files that different processes typically download. For instance, we 
are  interested  in  answering  questions  such  as:  What  category  of  processes  (e.g.  browsers,  windows 
processes, etc.) contribute more to malicious downloads? What files are typically downloaded by benign 
software?, and etc.
5.1. Analysis of Benign Processes that Download 
Executables
For our first measurements in this section, we focus on different categories of file download processes. 
We  group  the  client  processes  into  five  broad  classes,  namely  browsers,  windows  processes,  Java 
processes (i.e., Java runtime environment software), Acrobat Reader processes, and all other processes. 
We consider Java and Acrobat Reader processes separately because these two software are notoriously 
vulnerable and have been exploited by malware distributors many times in the past (e.g., via exploit kits 
like Nuclear, Fiesta or Angler5).
To label a process according to the above labels, we leverage the name of the executable file on disk from 
which the process was launched. For instance, any process with the name of firefox.exe is labeled as 
the Firefox web browser. To this end, we compiled a list of different file names observed in the wild for 
each process category. At the same time, we had to take into account the fact that malware may, in some 
cases, disguise itself as a legitimate process. Therefore, our measurements only focused on the download 
behavior of known benign processes whose related executable file hash matched our whitelist.

Table 10. Download behavior of benign processes (divided by process category)
23 | Exploring the Long Tail of (Malicious) Software Downloads
Table 10 reports each category, the number of distinct process versions (counted as the number of distinct 
hashes for the files from which the processes are launched), the overall number of machines used to run 
these processes, the number of executable files downloaded (and executed) by those processes, the 
number of machines that became infected due to malicious file downloads initiated by the processes, and 
the distribution of malicious types for the downloaded file.
From Table 10, we can immediately notice that most files downloaded by Java and Acrobat Reader are 
in fact malicious, and cause the related downloading machines to become infected. Specifically, of the 
1,080 machines that ran an instance of Acrobat Reader that was observed to initiate an executable file 
download,  78.52%  downloaded  and  executed  at  least  one  of  the  696  malicious  files,  thus  becoming 
infected. We can also see that none of the executable files downloaded by Acrobat Reader processes 
could  be  labeled  as  benign,  and  that  264  files  could  not  be  labeled  with  existing  ground  truth,  thus 
remaining unknown. However, it is likely that the vast majority (if not all) of these files are also malicious.
Similarly, Java processes mostly download malicious files. The 25 benign downloads shown in Table 10 
appear to be outliers, which we investigated more closely. A closer look revealed that these appeared to 
be legitimate bundled software like Java applets for sound recording or custom calendars.
Windows  system  processes  can  also  initiate  the  download  (and  execution)  of  new  malicious  files.  As 
mentioned earlier, we only consider known benign processes. We suspect that the malicious downloads 
are due to these processes being exploited (either remotely or locally). The number of machines affected 
by these malicious downloads is quite significant. In fact, of the 429,593 machines on which an executable 
file download was initiated by a Windows process, 27.71% downloaded and executed at least one of the 
68,767 malicious files we observed overall. This tends to suggest that a consistent number of Windows 
machines seem to run Windows processes that weren't properly patched, representing then a primary 
form of infection.
As  expected,  web  browsers  initiated  the  vast  majority  of  web-based  executable  file  downloads  (see 
“Browsers” in Table 10). Table 11 reports the number and type of files downloaded by popular browsers. 
Somewhat surprisingly, these results revealed that Internet Explorer (IE) could be considered as the “safest” 
browser,  based  on  the  percentage  of  malicious  downloads  it  initiated  and  the  percentage  of  infected 
machines. In fact, of the 411,138 machines that used IE to download one or more executable files, only 
18% became infected due to an IE-initiated malicious file download. On the other hand, of the 344,994 
machines that were observed using Chrome to download an executable file, 31.92% became infected, 
which represents the highest rate of infection across all popular browsers. We should note, though, that 
these results are based on the known malicious files, and that the large number of unknown file downloads 
by  both  Chrome  and  IE  could  tilt  the  scale  if  complete  ground  truth  was  available.  Nonetheless,  it  is 
significant that known malicious software tends to affect more Chrome users than IE users.

Table 11. Download behavior of benign browser processes
From Table 10 we can also see that droppers is the most represented malicious file type (if we exclude 
undefined  malicious  files)  downloaded  by  browsers.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  droppers 
are first-stage malware, which are typically used to download additional malware once the machine is 
infected.  This  observation  matches  the  results  we  presented  in  Table  6,  which  shows  that  85.6%  of 
droppers have a valid software signature, which is likely used as a way to evade current malware defenses 
and persuade users into running the software.
5.2. Analysis of Malicious Processes
To extend our experiments that explore the download behavior of processes, we turned our attention 
to the download behavior of malicious processes. In particular, we categorize the malicious processes 
according to their malware types and demonstrate what is typically downloaded by each malware type. 
Table  12  has  a  similar  structure  to  Table  10,  but  instead  of  process  categories,  it  explores  different 
malware types. In this case, the “Processes” column reports the number of processes associated with 
each malware type.
