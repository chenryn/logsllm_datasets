For critical systems it is important to know whether

communicate,  review  and  debate  the  level  of  trust 
achieved.  In  the  safety  domain,  explicit  Safety  Cases 
are  increasingly  required  by  law,  regulations  and 
standards. Yet the need to understand risks is not just a 
safety  issue  and  the  type  of  argumentation  used  for 
safety cases is not specific to safety alone. 
Prior  workshops,  beginning  with  one  held  at  DSN 
2004, have identified a number of technical, policy and 
research  challenges.  The  focus  of  this  workshop  is  on 
one  of  these  challenges:  metrics  for  assurance  cases 
for security. 
1. Introduction 
is 
to  be  able 
trustworthy  and 
For critical systems it is important to know whether 
the  system 
to 
communicate,  review  and  debate  the  level  of  trust 
achieved.  In  the  safety  domain,  explicit  Safety  Cases 
are  increasingly  required  by  law,  regulations  and 
standards.  It  has  become  common  for  the  case  to  be 
made  using  a  goal-based  approach,  where  claims  (or 
goals)  are  made  about  the  system  and  arguments  and 
evidence are presented to support those claims. 
The  need  to  understand  risks  is  not  just  a  safety 
issue: more and more organizations need to know their 
risks and to be able to communicate and address them 
to  multiple  stakeholders.  The  type  of  argumentation 
used for safety cases is not specific to safety alone, but 
it  can be used to  justify the  adequacy of systems with 
respect to other attributes of interest including security, 
reliability, etc. 
An  international  community  has  begun  to  form 
around  this  issue  of  generalized  assurance  cases  and 
the challenge of moving from the rhetoric to the reality 
of being able to implement convincing and valid cases. 
In a recent article in IEEE Security and Privacy [1] we 
outline what we have been doing so far in the security 
area, what we hope to achieve and where we go next. 
Prior  workshops,  beginning  with  one  held  at  DSN 
2004, have identified a number of technical, policy and 
research  challenges.  This  workshop  will  focus  on  one 
of  these  challenges:  metrics  for  assurance  cases  for 
security. 
2. The Importance of Metrics 
Metrics  can  be  essential  for  supporting  decisions 
regarding  the  resources  provided  to  develop  the 
assurance  case,  and  the  efficacy  of  the  resulting  case. 
However,  there  is  no  commonly  accepted  approach  to 
this  topic.  The purpose of this workshop is to  identify 
the state of the practice  in metrics for assurance cases 
in  the  specific  context  of  security,  identify  promising 
ways forward and research directions. 
We  expect  that  the  workshop  will  produce  the 
following outputs: 
1. Identification of the candidate metrics for assurance 
cases  for  security  and  the  characteristics  which  those 
metrics must posses. 
2.  A  listing  of  the  major  classes  of  evidence  for 
assurance  cases  for  security  and  a  mapping  of  classes 
of evidence to metrics. 
3.  Candidate  methods  for  combining  the  various 
classes of evidence toward the desired system security 
properties. 
3. Questions to be Answered 
In  the  context  of  security  the  workshop  will  answer 
questions such as: 
1. What makes an argument compelling? 
2. Are there standard patterns for arguments? 
3.What  arguments  should  be  compelling?  What 
arguments do people actually find compelling? 
 4.  How  do  additional  arguments  or  evidence  serve  to 
increase the compelling nature of a case?

compelling,  to  what  extent  do  we  know  that  these 
accepted notions are correct or incorrect? 
6.  Is  there  a  measure  of  compellingness  that  could  be 
used to compare alternative argumentation structures? 
7. How  can  assurance cases be composed? If they are 
composed,  is  it  also  possible  to  compose  the  metrics 
associated with the individual cases? 
8. How can arguments with different compelling force 
be compounded for supporting the case claims? 
9.  What  new  types  of  evidence  are  needed  to  create 
arguments  which  are  more  sound  and  how  will  we 
measure that they are more sound? 
10. By what  metrics do we  assess  the  effectiveness of 
evidence? 
11. What is the cost/benefit justification for developing 
an assurance case? 
12. Are there different levels of effort depending on the 
motivation? Can these levels be quantified? 
13.  Can  it  be  shown  that  a  well-defined  and  executed 
assurance  case  process  will  cost  less  than  current 
assurance processes? 
14. Given two cases, one that costs more and, by some 
metric,  is  more  compelling  than  the  other,  how  does 
one make the trade? 
4. Format and Expected Output 
The one day workshop will be held on Wednesday, 
June  27,  2007.  An  invited  talk  will  be  followed  by 
brief  presentations  by  those  who  have  previously 
submitted  position  papers.  The  “toy”  example 
developed at the June 2005 workshop referenced in [1] 
will  be  presented  and  used  to  motivate  and  focus  the 
ensuing discussions. A breakout session will be formed 
if appropriate and at the  end of the day a consolidated 
report and conclusions will be presented.
