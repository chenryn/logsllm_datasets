### 802.11g Communications and Botnet Tracking Potential

#### Introduction
In the context of 802.11g communications, it is important to note that during the 7-7:30 AM period, a conservative estimate of a 1% infection rate for a botnet is feasible. Additionally, a 45-meter broadcast radius for 802.11n is also considered conservative. This implies that as we move towards ubiquitous 802.11n-equipped smartphones, the potential for malicious network (malnet) tracking becomes a significant concern.

#### Experimental Setup
Based on these assumptions, we re-conducted our full-day experiments using 1% of the population as detectors. The results are shown in Figure 7. We observed that a 1% infection rate is sufficient to monitor nearly 50% of the population in Chicago on 10% of the observations throughout the day. The small standard deviations in the time between observations suggest that such a botnet would be effective at tracking in Chicago. However, it appears that Dallas would not be as susceptible to this type of tracking.

#### Detection Accuracy and Range
Detection occurs in three dimensions, but we measure triangulation in two dimensions: latitude and longitude. The altitude location of individuals is less relevant when determining which buildings they are in or near. As the broadcasting range increases, the fraction of the population that can be continuously monitored also increases. However, this comes with a trade-off in accuracy. For example, an individual detected by the tracking network at only one location with a 15-meter broadcast diameter specifies their location to approximately 30 square meters (inner-square approximation). In contrast, detection at one location with a 45-meter diameter specifies their location to approximately 8100 square meters (inner-square approximation).

#### Trilateration and Accuracy
Increasing the broadcasting range allows for multiple detections, which can lead to trilateration of position, providing a more precise location. Table 1 shows the performance of the tracking network using trilateration by finding the minimum area contained in the overlap of all bounding detection squares. Thus, while increasing the range results in some loss of accuracy, the increased number of observations somewhat mitigates this effect. For instance, there is a similar percentage of observations by four detectors with a 30-meter radius as with two detectors at a 15-meter radius, but the mean trilateration area only slightly more than doubles from 559.39 square meters to 1335.73 square meters.

#### Simulation of Human Mobility
To simulate human mobility, we used the UDelModels simulator [4,35], which was originally designed to test the effectiveness of ad-hoc wireless routing schemes. This simulator is suitable for our needs as it provides realistic simulations of people moving through several city blocks in downtown areas. We briefly describe the key benefits of the simulator in Subsection 5.2. The need for a simulator arises from the lack of any feasible dataset and the unlikelihood and costliness of acquiring an appropriate one.

#### Need for Simulation
To determine the frequency with which people can be tracked, we would ideally have a dataset containing the precise movements of all individuals with smartphones in a given metropolitan area over a significant period. This would allow us to simulate the detection and tracking processes accurately. However, due to the constraints mentioned, we rely on the UDelModels simulator.

#### Results and Observations
Figure 4 shows simulations of Chicago from 7-7:30 AM for 15-meter and 30-meter broadcast radii, with the tracking network comprising 10% of the population. We observe that a 1% infection rate is sufficient to monitor nearly 50% of the population in Chicago on 10% of the observations throughout the day. The small standard deviations in the time between observations suggest that such a botnet would be effective at tracking in Chicago. However, Dallas does not appear to be as susceptible to this type of tracking.

#### Conclusion
The potential for malnet tracking is quite real as we move towards ubiquitous 802.11n-equipped smartphones. The trade-offs between broadcasting range and accuracy, as well as the effectiveness of trilateration, highlight the need for careful consideration in designing and implementing such systems. Further research and simulation are necessary to fully understand and mitigate the risks associated with this type of tracking.
