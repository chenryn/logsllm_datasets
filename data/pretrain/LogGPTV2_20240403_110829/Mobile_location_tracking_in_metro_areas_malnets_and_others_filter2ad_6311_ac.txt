Note that since the 7-7:30am period is quite conservative,
a 1% infection rate for a botnet is feasible, and a 45m broad-
cast radius for 802.11n is also conservative, it implies that as
we move to ubiquitous 802.11n equipped smartphones, the
potential for malnet tracking is quite real! Based on this, we
re-performed our full day experiments using 1% of the popu-

5. SIMULATING HUMAN MOBILITY
We use the UDelModels simulator [4,35] to produce some-
what realistic simulations of people moving through several
city blocks of downtown cities. The simulator was con-
structed to test the eﬀectiveness of ad-hoc wireless routing
schemes, but it suits our needs, as we are interested in the
same population and its mobility dynamics. We brieﬂy de-
scribe the simulator’s key beneﬁts in Subsection 5.2. First
we justify the need for a simulator based on the lack of any
feasible dataset and the unlikelihood and costliness of being
able to acquire an appropriate one.
5.1 The Need for Simulation
To determine the frequency with which people can be
tracked we would ultimately like a data-set that contains the
precise movements of all individuals with smartphones in
a given metropolitan area over a signiﬁcant period of time.
This would allow one to simulate the detection and tracking

lation as detectors. Results are shown in Fig. 7. We observe
that a 1% infection rate is suﬃcient to monitor nearly 50%
of the population of Chicago on 10% of the observations
throughout the day. Combined with the small standard de-
viations on lengths of time between observations, and we
suggest that such a botnet would be eﬀective at tracking in
Chicago. Noticeably, it would seem that Dallas, would not
be susceptible.

Detection occurs in three dimensions, but we measure tri-
angulation in two dimensions: The altitude location of in-
dividuals is much less interesting then their latitude and
longitude when trying to determine what buildings they are
in or near by. While the fraction of the population that
can be continuously monitored increases with an increase
in broadcasting range, a side-eﬀect is to decrease the accu-
racy to which an individual can be placed. For example,
an individual detected by the tracking network at only one
location assuming a 15m broadcast diameter speciﬁes their
for our
location to approximately 30
inner-square approx.), whereas the detection by just one lo-
cation at a 45m diameter speciﬁes their location to approx-
imately a 8100m2
for our inner-square ap-
proximation). However, since the increase in broadcasting
region allows for multiple detections, and multiple detec-
tions lead to the ability for trilateration of position, which
gives a more precise position, the trade-oﬀ in accuracy is not
immediately clear. In Table 1 we show the calculation for
the performance of the tracking network using trilateration
of position by ﬁnding the minimum area that is contained
in the overlap of all the bounding detection squares. Thus
increasing range results in some loss of accuracy, but due
to increased observations the eﬀect is somewhat mitigated.
For example, there is a similar percentage of observations by
four detectors with a 30m radius, as with two detectors at
a 15m radius, yet the mean trilateration only slightly more
than doubles from 559.39m2
region (4050m2
to 1335.73m2

ically handled, appears to be illegal. Since the feasibility of
such an attack is most likely to be encountered in a dense
metropolis, small scale experiments on suburban or campus
environments are unlikely to provide useful information, as
we are unlikely to get even minimal detection with small
scale experiments, and we could not generalize to larger and
denser populations.
