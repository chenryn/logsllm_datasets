## Abstract
Public measurement platforms, such as RIPE Atlas, which consist of low-end hardware devices, have gained significant traction in the research community. These platforms offer extensive Internet-wide measurement capabilities and a growing set of measurement tools. To be scalable, they allow for concurrent measurements by multiple users. This paper addresses a fundamental question for platform users: Do measurements launched by others impact my results? If so, what can I do about it?

We conducted experiments to measure the impact of multiple users running parallel experiments on the RIPE Atlas platform. Our findings indicate that overlapping measurements interfere with each other in at least two ways. First, we show that concurrent measurements can significantly increase the reported timings from probes. We found that upgrading the hardware CPU can help mitigate this interference. Second, we demonstrate that measurement campaigns can become desynchronized by up to one hour due to concurrent loads. Unlike precision, better hardware does not help with synchronization.

## 1. Introduction
Public measurement platforms, such as RIPE Atlas, are increasingly used by researchers and network operators. These platforms are not only used to measure network performance but also to map the Internet, detect routing attacks, identify routing anomalies, and monitor censorship. To scale and be practical, these platforms schedule measurements in parallel without providing feedback to the user. This raises concerns about measurement interferences. What is the impact of an increased load on the precision of measurements? Do the measurements performed by one participant affect the results obtained by others? If so, by how much? Can this impact previous research results? This paper empirically answers these questions for the RIPE Atlas platform.

By measuring the interference between our own experiments (§3), we show that measurements indeed interfere with each other, sometimes significantly. Specifically, we found that user-induced interferences can impact two aspects of measurements: precision and synchrony.

- **Precision**: The precision of delay measurements (e.g., using ping) can be significantly affected when other measurements are launched concurrently.
- **Synchrony**: User-induced interferences can heavily desynchronize experiments performed on multiple probes, even when launched simultaneously.

Our key findings are:

- The precision of measurements from and towards the probe is impacted when other measurements use the probe at the same time. On older hardware, delays increase by more than 1 ms in the median case and by more than 7 ms for the 95th percentile (Table 2).
- Measurements are quickly desynchronized under heavy load, with completion times delayed by up to one hour (Figure 8).
- Upgrading the probe hardware significantly improves precision levels but does not help with synchronization.
- Previous research results and the RIPE Atlas historic dataset may have been affected by interfering measurements. We highlight two techniques to mitigate interferences in the future (§6).

Overall, our results show that measurement interferences should be systematically considered when analyzing results from public platforms. To ensure reproducibility, all our measurement and analysis tools are available online [9].

## 2. The RIPE Atlas Platform
We now describe the RIPE Atlas platform and highlight its increasing popularity among the academic community.

As of April 2015, RIPE Atlas consists of over 6,700 public probes distributed across 197 countries. There are three versions of the probes, differing only by their hardware. Version 1 and version 2 are identical except for the amount of RAM: both are Lantronix XPort Pro with a 167 MHz CPU, 8 MB or 16 MB of RAM, respectively, and a 16 MB flash. Version 3 probes are TP-Link TL-MR3020 routers with a 400 MHz CPU, 32 MB of RAM, and a 4 MB NAND, making them more powerful.

Figure 1 depicts the evolution of the number of public probes per version since the platform's inception. The number of v3 probes has increased rapidly since their distribution began in 2013, while the number and proportion of v1 and v2 probes, though decreasing, remain non-negligible, accounting for 28.2% of the probes in April 2015.

RIPE Atlas uses credits to regulate platform usage and schedules users' measurements concurrently. As of 2015, RIPE Atlas offers four types of measurements: ping, traceroute, DNS, and SSL. A measurement is defined by its type, frequency, and set of probes. Users can also specify start and end dates. If no dates are provided, the measurement will start as soon as possible and must be stopped manually. One-off measurements are near real-time if no start time is defined, with results expected within 10 seconds.

RIPE Atlas regulates user load via a credit system. Users earn credits by hosting a probe and use them to perform measurements. The cost model is based on the resources each measurement requires, with traceroute being the most expensive and ping the cheapest. One-off measurements are also more expensive (twice as much) as scheduled ones due to their unpredictable arrival.

RIPE Atlas uses basic scheduling strategies on each probe to handle concurrent load. The source code of the RIPE Atlas probes is based on BusyBox and has been adapted to improve event management using the libevent library. In addition, probes control the measurement frequency with eperd, a cron-like utility. One-off measurements are managed by the utility eooqd. Probes receive measurement requests from their controller via a telnet daemon. Since several users can use a probe simultaneously, it is essential to schedule and limit user requests. In 2013, RIPE made the Atlas source code publicly available but not yet the controller’s.

Atlas probes are popular sources of measurements and are increasingly used in research. Since its inception, Atlas has performed almost 30 million individual measurements.

## 3. Quantifying Interference
We describe how we quantify interference between measurements performed on a RIPE Atlas probe. We take the perspective of one user λ and one probe ρ and measure the effects on the results reported by ρ to λ when: i) ρ originates; or ii) is the target of concurrent measurements. Specifically, we look at changes in the delay reported by ρ when concurrent one-off traceroutes are originated or when ρ is used as a ping destination. We use NL Ring nodes [25] as destinations (or sources) of the pings sourced on (or destined to) ρ. We also examine changes in the completion time of one-off traceroute experiments performed on ρ.

We measure the delay reported by a probe using ping, as delay-based measurements are the most sensitive to concurrent load. In contrast, traceroute, SSL, and DNS measurements are less sensitive to load.
