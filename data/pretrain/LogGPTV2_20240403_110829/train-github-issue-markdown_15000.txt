by **PI:EMAIL** :
    The http.ResonseWriter exposes a UsingTLS() method which is good, but the other info
    stored in the tls.Conn structure is not available. Could the interface be
    extended/changed to allow access to more of the TLS properties?
    (this is related to https://golang.org/issue/155)
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    6g
    Which operating system are you using?
    linux,x86_64
    Which revision are you using?  (hg identify)

    Please provide any additional information below.
    I can "patch in" by creating a custom Listener that mimics the
    tls.Listener and gets the information there, but I can't figure out a
    way of propagating that info up the stack to the actual handlers
    without:
    a) hacking in the http/server.go and adding an accessor there similar
    to the way UsingTLS() is implemented - which is not real nice I guess.
    or b) writing a custom equivalent of http.conn/http.response, which is
    a lot of duplicated code.
