User: My understanding of changing db.Model schemas is that it 'doesn't matter' if you add a property and then try and fetch old entities without that property.
Indeed, adding the following property to my SiteUser db.Model running on dev_server:
category_subscriptions = db.StringProperty()
Still allows me to retrieve an old SiteUser entity doesn't have this property (via a GQL query).
However, changing the property to a list property, (either StringListProperty, ListProperty):
category_subscriptions = db.StringListProperty()
results in the following error when I try and retrieve the user:
BadValueError: Property category_subscriptions is required
This is on the SDK dev server version 1.7.4. Why is that and how would I work around it?
Assistant: here's my workaround to get it working on dev_server:
1) update your model in production and deploy it
2) use appcfg.py download_data and grab all entities of the type you've updated
3) use appcfg.py upload_data and push all the entities into your local datastore
voila.. your local datastore entities can now be retrieved without generating BadValueError
