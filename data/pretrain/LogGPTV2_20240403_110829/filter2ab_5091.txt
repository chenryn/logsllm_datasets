**ATT&CK ID:** T1630.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Uninstall Malicious Application

Adversaries may incorporate functionality into malware that allows it to uninstall itself from the target device. This can be achieved through several methods, including:

- **Scheduled Tasks or Scripts:** The malware may create a scheduled task or script that runs at a specific time or under certain conditions to remove the malicious application.
- **Self-Deletion:** The malware may contain code that triggers its own deletion after completing its objectives.
- **Registry Modifications:** The malware may modify the Windows Registry to remove entries that point to its installation, effectively making the system "forget" about its presence.
- **File Deletion:** The malware may delete its own files and any associated artifacts, such as log files or temporary files, to erase traces of its activity.

By using these techniques, adversaries can make it more difficult for security teams to detect and analyze the malware, thus evading detection and prolonging their access to the compromised system.
