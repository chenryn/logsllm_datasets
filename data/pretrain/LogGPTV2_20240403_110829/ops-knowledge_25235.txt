User: In the "Memcache Viewer", is there any way to dump a list of existing keys? Just for debugging, of course, not for use in any scripts!
I ask because it doesn't seem like the GAE SDK is using a "real" memcache server, so I'm guessing it's emulated in Python (for simplicity, as it's just a development server).. This would mean there is a dict somewhere with the keys/values..
Assistant: People ask for this on the memcached list a lot, sometimes with the same type of "just in case I want to look around to debug something" sentiment.
The best way to handle this is to know how you generate your keys, and just go look stuff up when you want to know what's stored for a given value.
If you have too many things using memcached to do that within the scope of your debugging session, then start logging access.
But keep in mind -- memcached is fast because it doesn't allow for such things in general.  The community server does have limited functionality to get a subset of the keys available within a given slab class, but it's probably not what you really want, and hopefully google doesn't implement it in theirs.  :)
