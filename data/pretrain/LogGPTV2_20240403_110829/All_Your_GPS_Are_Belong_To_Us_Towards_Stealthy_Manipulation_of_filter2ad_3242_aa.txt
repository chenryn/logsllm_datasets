Abstract
Mobile navigation services are used by billions of users
around globe today. While GPS spooﬁng is a known
threat, it is not yet clear if spooﬁng attacks can truly ma-
nipulate road navigation systems. Existing works pri-
marily focus on simple attacks by randomly setting user
locations, which can easily trigger a routing instruction
that contradicts with the physical road condition (i.e.,
easily noticeable).
In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a stealthy
manipulation attack against road navigation systems.
The goal is to trigger the fake turn-by-turn navigation
to guide the victim to a wrong destination without be-
ing noticed. Our key idea is to slightly shift the GPS
location so that the fake navigation route matches the
shape of the actual roads and trigger physically pos-
sible instructions. To demonstrate the feasibility, we
ﬁrst perform controlled measurements by implementing
a portable GPS spoofer and testing on real cars. Then, we
design a searching algorithm to compute the GPS shift
and the victim routes in real time. We perform exten-
sive evaluations using a trace-driven simulation (600 taxi
traces in Manhattan and Boston), and then validate the
complete attack via real-world driving tests (attacking
our own car). Finally, we conduct deceptive user studies
using a driving simulator in both the US and China. We
show that 95% of the participants follow the navigation
to the wrong destination without recognizing the attack.
We use the results to discuss countermeasures moving
forward.

Introduction
Billions of users around globe are relying on mobile nav-
igation services today [45]. Ranging from map applica-
tions (e.g., Google Maps, Waze) to taxi sharing platforms
(e.g., Uber, Lyft), these services depend on accurate and
reliable GPS inputs. Recently, GPS systems also start
to play a major role in navigating autonomous vehicles,
with a key impact on the driving safety [11].
In the meantime, there has been a growing concern
about the security of GPS applications. GPS is vulnera-
ble to spooﬁng attacks where adversaries can inject falsi-
ﬁed GPS signals to control the victim’s GPS device [55].
Such attacks did happen in the real-world, especially tar-
geting drones and ships. For example, Humphreys et al.
demonstrated a successful GPS spooﬁng attack against
drones in 2012 [28]. In 2013, a luxury yacht was inten-
tionally diverted from Monaco to Greece by spooﬁng its
receiving GPS signals [46].
To understand the risks of GPS spooﬁng attacks, re-
searchers have explored to build GPS spoofers to spoof
drones, ships and wearable devices [25,26,61]. However,
these works mainly focus on simple attacks by setting
random locations in the target device [25, 26, 61]. Other
works have examined GPS spooﬁng attacks on systems
in the open environment (e.g., open air/water) such as
drones and ships [28, 46] where a simple GPS change
could (stealthily) steer their navigation.
So far, it is still an open question regarding whether
attackers can manipulate the road navigation systems by
spooﬁng the GPS inputs. The problem is critical con-
sidering that navigation systems are actively used by
billions of drivers on the road and play a key role in
autonomous vehicles. At the same time, the problem
is challenging given that most road navigation systems
are used (or closely monitored) by human drivers.
In
addition, naive GPS manipulations are unlikely to suc-
ceed primarily because of the physical road constraints.
For example, random GPS manipulation can easily cre-
ate “physically impossible” navigation instructions (e.g.,
turn left in the middle of a highway). Since the possi-
bility of the attack is not yet clear, most civilian systems
don’t have any defense mechanisms in place.
In this paper, we take systematic steps to explore
the feasibility of manipulating road navigation systems
stealthy by carefully crafting the spoofed GPS inputs.

The goal is to manipulate the turn-by-turn navigation and
guide a victim to a wrong destination without being no-
ticed. The key intuition is that users are more likely to
rely on GPS services when navigating in unfamiliar ar-
eas (conﬁrmed via user study). In addition, most naviga-
tion systems display the “ﬁrst-person” view which forces
users to focus on the current road and the next turn. To
these ends, if an attacker identiﬁes an attacking route that
mimics the shape of the route displayed on the map, then
it is possible to trigger navigation instructions that are
consistent with the physical environment (e.g., triggering
the “turning right” prompt only when there is an actual
right-turn ahead) to avoid alerting users.
To understand the attack feasibility, we take four key
steps1. First, we implement a GPS spoofer to per-
form empirical measurements to understand the attack-
ers’ practical constraints and capacities. Second, we de-
sign the attacking algorithms and evaluate them based
on empirical taxi driving traces. Third, we implement
the system and validated it using real-world driving tests
(the attacks are applied to the author’s car, with care-
ful protections and ethical reviews). Finally, we conduct
“deceptive” user studies to examine the feasibility of the
attack with other users (non-authors) in the loop and un-
derstand key factors to the success of the attack.
Measurements. We show that adversaries can build a
portable spoofer with low costs (about $223), which can
easily penetrate the car body to take control of the GPS
navigation system. Our measurement shows that effec-
tive spooﬁng range is 40–50 meters and the target device
can consistently latch onto the false signals without los-
ing connections. The results suggest that adversaries can
either place the spoofer inside/under the target car and
remotely control the spoofer, or tailgate the target car in
real time to perform spooﬁng.
Stealthy Attacking Algorithm.
To make attack
stealthy, we design searching algorithms that search for
attacking routes in real-time. The algorithm crafts the
GPS inputs to the target device such that the triggered
navigation instruction and displayed routes on the map
remain consistent with the physical road network.
In
the physical world, the victim who follows the instruc-
tion would be led to a wrong route (or a wrong destina-
tion). We evaluate algorithms using trace-driving simu-
lations (600 taxi trips in total) from Manhattan [5] and
Boston [1]. On average, our algorithm identiﬁed 1547
potential attacking routes for each target trip for the at-
tacker to choose from. If the attacker aims to endanger
the victim, the algorithm can successfully craft special
attack route that contains wrong-ways for 99.8% of the
trips. Finally, the algorithm also allows the attacker to
pre-deﬁne a target destination area to lead the victim to.
1Our study received the approval from our local IRB (#17-936).
Real-world Driving Test.
We implemented the al-
gorithm and tested it by attacking our own car in a real-
world driving test. We have taken careful protection to
ensure research ethics (e.g., experiments after midnight
in suburb areas, appropriate shield and power control).
We demonstrate the feasibility of the attack to trigger the
target navigation instructions in real-time while the vic-
tim (the author) is driving.
User Study.
Finally, we examine the attack feasi-
bility with users (non-authors) in the loop. Due to the
risk of attacking real cars, we instead perform a decep-
tive experiment using a driving simulator. We customize
the driving simulator to load a high-resolution 3D street
map of real-world cities. We apply deception by phras-
ing the study as a “usability test of the driving software”,
while we perform spooﬁng attacks during the experiment
(informed consent obtained afterwards). The user study
(N = 40) was conducted in both the US and China with
consistent results. We show the proposed attack is highly
effective: 38 out of 40 participants (95%) follow the nav-
igation to all the wrong destinations. Based on our re-
sults, we discuss possible solutions moving forward.
In summary, our paper makes three key contributions.
• We propose a novel attack that manipulates the road
navigation systems stealthily. The proposed algo-
rithm is extensively evaluated using real-world taxi
driving traces.
• We implement the attack algorithm and a low-cost
portable GPS spoofer. Real-world measurements and
driving tests on the road conﬁrm the attack feasibility.
• We conduct a user study to demonstrate the attack
feasibility with human drivers in the loop. The results
provide key insights into how common driving habits
make users vulnerable.
We hope the results can help to raise the attention in
the community to develop practically deployable defense
mechanisms (e.g., location veriﬁcation, signal authenti-
cation, sensor fusion) to protect the massive GPS device
users and emerging GPS-enabled autonomous systems.
2 Background and Threat Model
In this section, we start by providing the background of
GPS spooﬁng attacks and describing the unique chal-
lenges in road navigation scenarios.
Global Positioning System (GPS).
GPS is a space-
based radio navigation system that provides the geolo-
cation and time information. To date, it consists of
31 satellites in medium Earth orbit where each satel-
lite is equipped with a synchronized atomic clock. Each
satellite continuously broadcasts GPS information using

MHz and encrypted precision (P/Y) code on L2 band at
1227.60MHz with 50 bps data rate. P(Y) code is used ex-
clusively by authorized U.S. military receivers and C/A
code is not encrypted for general civilian access.
GPS Spooﬁng Attacks.
Civilian GPS is vulner-
able to spooﬁng attacks. GPS spooﬁng attacks have
two key steps: First, in the takeover step, attacker lures
the victim GPS receiver to migrate from the legitimate
signal to the spooﬁng signal. The takeover phase can
be either brute-forced or smooth.
In the former case,
a spoofer simply transmits the false signals at a high
power, causing the victim to lose track of the satellites
and lock on to the stronger spooﬁng signals. In contrast,
smooth takeover begins by transmitting signals synchro-
nized with the original ones and then gradually overpow-
ering the original signal to cause the migration. The ad-
vantage of smooth takeover is the stealthiness since it
will not generate abnormal jumps in the received sig-
nal strength. However, smooth takeover requires special-
ized hardware to real-time track and synchronize with the
original signals at the victim’s location (costly) [26, 41].
Next, in the second step, the attacker can manipulate the
GPS receiver by either shifting the signals’ arrival time
or modifying the navigation messages [41, 46].
2.1 Threat Model
In this paper, we explore a novel attack against road navi-
gation systems by spooﬁng the GPS inputs. In this attack,
the victim is a driver who uses a GPS navigation system
(e.g., a mobile app) while driving on the road. The victim
can also be a person sitting in a GPS-enabled self-driving
car. The attacker spoofs the signals of the victim’s GPS
receiver to manipulate the routing algorithm of naviga-
tion system. The attacker’s goal is to guide the victim
to take a wrong route without alerting the victim (i.e.,
stealthy). The attack can be realized for three purposes.
• Deviating Attack. The attacker aims to guide the
victim to follow a wrong route, but the attacker does
not have a speciﬁc target destination. In practice, the
attacker may detour ambulances or police cars to en-
ter a loop route.
• Targeted Deviating Attack. The attacker aims to
guide the victim to a target destination pre-deﬁned
by the attacker, for example, for ambush, robbery or
stealing a self-driving car.
• Endangering Attack. The attacker aims to guide the
victim into a dangerous situation, for example, enter-
ing the wrong way on a highway.
In our threat model, the attacker has no access to the
internal software/hardware of the target GPS device or
those of the navigation service. The attacker also can-
not modify the navigation services or algorithms (e.g.,
on Google Maps servers). In addition, we assume the at-
tacker knows the victim’s rough destination area (e.g., a
ﬁnancial district, a hotel zone) or the checkpoint that the
victim will bypass (e.g., main bridges, tunnels, highway
entrances). In later sections, we will justify why this as-
sumption is reasonable and design our attack to tolerate
the inaccurate estimation of the victim’s destination. We
focus on low-cost methods to launch the attack without
the need for expensive and specialized hardware.
Compared to spooﬁng a drone or a ship [8, 25, 28, 46,
61]., there are unique challenges to manipulate the road
navigation systems. First, road navigation attack has
strict geographical constraints. It is far more challeng-
ing to perform GPS spooﬁng attacks in real-time while
coping with road maps and vehicle speed limits. In ad-
dition, human drivers are in the loop of the attack, which
makes a stealthy attack necessary.
The scope of the attack is limited to scenarios where
users heavily rely on the GPS device for navigation. For
example, when a user drives in a very familiar area (e.g.,
commuting from home to work), the user is not necessar-
ily relying on GPS information to navigate. We primarily
target people who drive in an unfamiliar environment. In
addition, the attack will be applicable to self-driving cars
that rely on GPS and the physical-world road conditions
for navigation (instead of the human drivers).
3 Measurement-driven Feasibility Study
We start by performing real-world measurements to un-
derstand the constraints of the attacker’s capacity in prac-
tice. The results will help to design the corresponding
attacking algorithms in the later sections.
