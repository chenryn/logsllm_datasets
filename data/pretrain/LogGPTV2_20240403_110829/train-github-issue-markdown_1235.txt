Hello,

I frequently use keyboard shortcuts to access the menus in my text editor. I installed Atom yesterday and have been enjoying it so farâ€”thank you!

However, this morning I discovered that I am unable to open the "File" and "Help" menus on Windows 8.1 using the shortcuts Alt+F and Alt+H. Strangely, the other menus (such as "Find," "Edit," "Packages," and "Selection") work perfectly fine.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
