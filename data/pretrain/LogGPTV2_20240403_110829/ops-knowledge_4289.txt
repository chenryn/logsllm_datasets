User: can anybody give me advice how i process a BMP file so 
that i can check if a logo is present in that file?
E.g. I have a Foto.  My logo is supplied in another 
bmp file. I want to check if my logo is part of that
foto, if it is visible.
Bonus question: My logo can have transparencies in it. 
Does that change anything?
Assistant: Read up your favorite literature on the subject of digital watermarking.
It's not trivial if you want it to be robust to various distortions, image compression, transparency, etc. - nothing I can answer here in a few lines.
