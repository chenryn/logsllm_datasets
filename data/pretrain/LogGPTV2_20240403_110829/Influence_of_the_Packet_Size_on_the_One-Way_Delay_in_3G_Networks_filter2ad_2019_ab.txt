to be the narrowest part in the end-to-end chain. Furthermore, to minimize the
impact of daily patterns, congestion, radio problems, queueing, etc., we focus our
analysis on the minimum OWD obtained in the experiments. However, just to
give an indication on the environments, mean OWD was in the range of 140 ms
to 700 ms, while the maximum was between 200 and 3870 ms, and the standard
deviation was found between 7 ms and 480 ms.
In the ﬁrst experiment we investigated IP packet sizes starting at 60 bytes,
and incrementing 16 bytes for each run, up to 1468 bytes, at a sending rate
of one packet per second. We start by looking on the variations over time in
the OWD of individual packets (one 48 byte packet every 10 second), shown in

Figure 4. We see that all graphs look quite similar, and around 1–2 hours into
the experiment, the smallest OWD drops to a new, stable level. The peak values
are typical for mobile networks and originate from the ARQ mechanisms of the
RA.
Now, we turn our attention to the minimum OWD obtained when varying
the packet sizes, which is illustrated in Figure 5. There are two clear regions,
one from 60 to 252 bytes and the other from 252 bytes and above. From the
E220 GUI (MobilePartner), we get an indication of what service the operator

IP Packet size [bytes]
Fig. 6. Minimal OWD for packet sizes from 100 to 300 bytes
is providing the modem with. However, the GUI only reports WCDMA or HS-
DPA as the service. When the experiments were conducted, all operators started
by giving a WCDMA service. As the packet sizes increased they started to al-
ternate between WCDMA and HSDPA, and eventually changed permanently
to a HSDPA service. The point where the change was made varied a little bit
from operator to operator, but it happened around 236 to 256 bytes, matching
nicely with the drop of the OWD in Figure 4. Looking at the second region,
we clearly see a staircase pattern. The steps are 144 bytes wide, and the step
height is approximately 18 ms for all operators. This indicates that somewhere
in the end-to-end path, some entity sends the data in blocks of approximately
144 bytes. In case of operator A and B, diﬀerent behaviours were seen for two
packet sizes, 844 bytes for operator A and 1084 bytes for operator B. The reason
for this behaviour merits further investigation. It is also worth noting that both
operators exhibited a very small minimum OWD around 80 ms, which is the
smallest value in the HSDPA region.
In order to gain more insight into the behaviour of the minimal OWD at the tran-
sition between WCDMA and HSDPA regions, we conducted a second and more
detailed experiment. The packet size was incremented from 100 bytes to 300 bytes
with an increment of 4 bytes. The result is shown in Figure 6. The upper graph
holds operator A and B, while the lower holds operator C. We have separated the
graphs to highlight the patterns for operator A and B. For those operators, the
staircase pattern is present, however not as pronounced as before. The width of
the step is around 36 bytes, and the step height is approximately 60 ms. During
the evaluation of the packets, both operators started by providing WCDMA ser-
vice, then operator A changed (temporarily) to HSDPA for the 116 and 132 byte

packets, while operator B didn’t oﬀer HSDPA until we reached a packet size of
196 bytes. But subsequently, both operators tend to oﬀer HSDPA more frequently,
and after 248 bytes both only oﬀered HSDPA service. Looking at the measure-
ments taken from operator C, that pattern is much less clear, the operator had
started switching to HSDPA earlier. Due to this, the same staircase pattern for
packet sizes up to 188 bytes is not as clearly visible as for operators A and B.
5 Conclusions and Outlook
Based on quality-assured measurements from three Swedish mobile operators,
this paper provides insights into the relationship between packet sizes and one-
way delays, revealing the corresponding operator’s resource allocation policy on
the WCDMA/HSDPA uplink. Hereby, the quality of the one-way delay (OWD)
measurements has been assured by a speciﬁc set-up and cabling scheme between
Endace DAG cards that avoids common clock synchronisation problems, and by
a quantiﬁcation of the delay contribution of the gateway feeding the mobile link.
The most surprising result is that short packets might need more time to
reach the receiver than long packets. Short packets experience a rather steep
increase of OWD as their size is growing. For packet sizes in the range of 100 to
250 bytes, the minimal OWD varies heavily. For larger packets, it grows starting
from quite small values (less than 100 ms) with a quite decent gradient. In
both cases, the minimal OWD is increased approximately stepwise as a function
of the packet size, which means that the maximal packet size per step allows
for maximizing the throughput without paying for it in terms of extra delay.
Thus, our method and results deliver guidelines for application programmers
to make the best out of mobile connectivity w.r.t. delay and throughput by
choosing optimal packet sizes. In our case, packet sizes of at least 250 bytes
avoid the potentially large and strongly varying miminal OWDs associated with
smaller packets. Once again, the study shows the necessity to investigate the
characteristics of network connectivities if these are not explicitly known. The
outliers detected for operator A and B also merit further investigation.
Of course, it has to be observed that due to radio and network conditions, the
actual OWD is likely to exceed the minimal value under consideration. Never-
theless, the minimal OWD indicates the best performance that can be expected,
given the chosen packet size. The examination of further OWD statistics is left
for future work.
The results obtained so far motivate the use of the proposed measurement
method on the downlink and comparison of the results with each other and with
measured roundtrip times. The quite signiﬁcant delay for small packets might
aﬀect the eﬀective throughput of downloads using TCP, as the acknowledgements
are small packets carried on the uplink. Thus, further work will include the study
of the impact of the discovered allocation policy onto TCP performance.
