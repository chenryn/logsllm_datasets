maximizing security through automation and user engage-
ment. We propose more transparency for users, secure el-
ements/CPUs, and collaborative protocols for practical im-
provement.
As future work, further usability studies will be required
to determine these suggestions’ actual effectiveness and ef-
ﬁciency. For instance, lab studies could be conducted in
which counterfeit/modiﬁed HSTs, with and without our rec-
ommended improvements, are provided to users in order to
assess how well they can detect attacks, and how much of a
difference can be achieved through our suggestions. We fur-
thermore aim at developing a standardized procedure, includ-
ing security labels which help users to judge HST genuineness
based on the implemented authenticity checks. We will use
participatory design studies to investigate how security guar-
antees can be visualized and made transparent to users. We
also plan to examine novel attestation methods (e.g., trans-
parent molded enclosures) via user experiments. Researchers
should also study how collaborative protocols and currently
not implemented hardware tampering prevention approaches
(e.g., sensors, hardware metering) can be applied to HSTs.
We propose to include prospective users in the design
process of HSTs to determine a threshold for user engage-
ment and obfuscation. Our work strongly suggests that the re-
search community, together with token manufacturers, needs
to assess and develop secure yet comprehensible authenticity
checks for HSTs.
