Assistant: This log chunk shows the DisplayPowerController process (PID 1702) attempting to animate the brightness of the display to a target of 38 with a rate of 200. Warnings are also logged from the ActivityManager process (PID 1702) indicating that certain callers do not have the necessary permissions to access certain tasks.
