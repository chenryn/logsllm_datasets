Abstract. One of the most challenging applications of wireless network-
ing are in disaster area networks where lack of infrastructure, limited en-
ergy resources, need for common operational picture and thereby reliable
dissemination are prevalent. In this paper we address anomaly detection
in intermittently connected mobile ad hoc networks in which there is
little or no knowledge about the actors on the scene, and opportunis-
tic contacts together with a store-and-forward mechanism are used to
overcome temporary partitions. The approach uses a statistical method
for detecting anomalies when running a manycast protocol for dissemina-
tion of important messages to k receivers. Simulation of the random walk
gossip (RWG) protocol combined with detection and mitigation mecha-
nisms is used to illustrate that resilience can be built into a network in a
fully distributed and attack-agnostic manner, at a modest cost in terms
of drop in delivery ratio and additional transmissions. The approach is
evaluated with attacks by adversaries that behave in a similar manner
to fair nodes when invoking protocol actions.
1 Introduction
Disaster area networks are created through spontaneous mobilisation of ad hoc
communication when the existing infrastructure is wiped out or severely over-
loaded. In such environments, in addition to local establishments of cellular net-
works and satellite connections there is a potential for hastily formed networks
(HFN) [1] of wireless devices connecting via 802.11 or similar technologies. One
of the major needs in a disaster area is timely dissemination of information
destined for a large group of actors. However, due to the nature of the multi-
party engagements, and massive engagement of volunteers there is little room
for establishment of mutual trust infrastructures. Any dissemination protocols
destined for such environments require to function in a chaotic context where
the node identiﬁers or even the number of involved nodes cannot be assumed.
The physical aspects of above networks can be characterised by intermittent
connectivity, leading to networks in which existence of partitions is a norm. This
creates a variation of mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) with no contempo-
raneous routes among the nodes, also referred to as intermittently connected

MANET (IC-MANET). Experience from the Katrina HFN [2] shows that even
in disaster environments there are security threats – actors who try to disrupt
operations or use the information for own beneﬁt. However, the application of
security measures in these environments is far from trivial. This paper addresses
security issues that impact dissemination of messages, and thereby focuses on
the availability of the dissemination services in IC-MANET.
We study the impact of intrusions on a dissemination protocol, Random
Walk Gossip (RWG) that is designed to run in IC-MANET in a disaster area
network [3]. This algorithm is intended to disseminate important messages to
any k receivers, thereby a manycast algorithm that does not rely on knowledge
about the network nodes. Its main characteristics are that it overcomes lack of
information with opportunistic contacts and uses a store-and-forward mechanism
to overcome network partitions. Moreover, to act in an energy-eﬃcient manner
it will try to avoid excessive transmissions by decentralised control of number of
custodians for a given message.
In such a scenario the adversary has no choice other than behaving in a
way that resembles the rest of the nodes in the network, and we further assume
that the adversary too needs to be eﬃcient in its use of energy and bandwidth
resources. In fact the adversary may not act normally, but seen from a restricted
view, being the local knowledge at each mobile node, it follows fragments of the
protocol speciﬁcation.
Intrusion detection mechanisms are intended to identify malicious activity
targeted at the resources of a monitored system, broadly classiﬁed as misuse or
anomaly detection. The former requires the formulation of misuse constraints,
which are extremely complex when the adversary behaves within the boundaries
of the protocol speciﬁcations and when at the same time it must be suitable for
diﬀerent environments, i.e. dynamic load, partition sizes, varying local densities
and connectivity changes. In the IC-MANET context anomaly detection is a
suitable approach to intrusion detection while misuse detection is less appropri-
ate. First, the fact that the adversary behaves in a similar way to the fair nodes
makes formulation of misuse constraints hard if not impossible. Second, even
if we can formulate a set of rules for undesirable packet sequences, these will
hardly work in all nodes due to dynamic load and partition changes.
Our approach builds on a learning based anomaly detection technique that
uses only normal data in the learning phase. While this might be a limitation of
the approach, since there is no guarantee that attacks are not present in the early
deployment phase in the scenario, we believe that the eﬃciency of the technique
will outweigh its disadvantages. Another major problem in highly unpredictable
and partitionable networks is what to do when an attack is suspected. If the
network is generally chaotic and the goal is to maintain dissemination levels
then it is less relevant to exactly identify adversary nodes and try to isolate or
ignore them. We therefore suggest mitigation approaches that enable each node
to adjust its own behaviour thereby reducing the eﬀect of the suspected attack.
The threat model that we consider is that the adversary tries (1) to drain the
network resources, both at node level (battery life) and network level (available
bandwidth), thereby reducing the dissemination ﬂows, and (2) acts as an ab-
sorbing patch which reduces some message dissemination in its vicinity, acting
as a grey hole at certain times and locations. Clearly this threat model creates
a challenging type of adversary to detect.
Our detection and mitigation approach has been evaluated in a simulation
setting where an implementation of the RWG algorithm is running with a disas-
ter mobility model adapted from earlier work [4]. The evaluations indicate that
the approach indeed creates a resistance to attacks that match the above threat
model, and show that the network recovers from the attack when it is of a tran-
sient nature. Moreover, our approach dampens the eﬀect of the attacks on the
network resources by preserving the overall overhead in the network compared to
the non-mitigated case, whilst not losing the delivery goals signiﬁcantly. These
results are obtained despite the fact that the classical metrics used for evalua-
tion of intrusion detection do not show good results. The paper discusses why
the network performance metrics are more useful in IC-MANET clarifying the
impact of partitions, traﬃc load and the store-and-forward approach.
The contributions of the paper are as follows:
– Presentation of a scalable approach to anomaly detection and mitigation in
partitionable ad-hoc networks with scarce resources that run a given dissem-
ination protocol suitable for these environments. The detection algorithm is
scalable since it is fully distributed and eﬃcient. It is a statistical mecha-
nism reminiscent of the chi-square technique [5]. It has been adapted to the
speciﬁc RWG protocol by selection of appropriate (general) features.
– Illustration of the approach using a simulation platform, and speciﬁcally
analysing why the performance based metrics outperform the classic detec-
tion rate and false positive rate metrics in such disaster area networks.

Yang et al. [6] describe the major security challenges in MANET and some of the
existing solutions. Among the identiﬁed challenges are the lack of a well-deﬁned
place to deploy the security solutions, the vulnerability of the information con-
tained within the devices, the fact of communicating within a shared medium,
bandwidth, computation and energy resource constraints, the dynamic network
topology, and the wireless channel characteristics (e.g. interference and other
eﬀects leading to unreliability). It is also stated that a complete security solu-
tion should integrate prevention, detection and reaction components. Prevention
typically evolves around establishment of trust, often based on cryptographic
techniques. However, trust is not easy to achieve in such scenarios [1] and cryp-
tographic techniques, as studied in Prasithsangaree and Krishnamurthy [7], usu-
ally are computationally too expensive. Farrell and Cahill [8], in the context of
delay-tolerant networks, also mention the lack of cryptographic key management
schemes as an open issue.
Orthogonal to the preventive perspective we need to consider the role of
intrusion detection in IC-MANET. Several approaches to intrusion detection
have already been proposed for the MANET Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector
(AODV) and Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR) protocols. However, to our
knowledge no earlier works address multicast protocols, and speciﬁcally not those
suitable to run in a partitioned MANET. Some authors propose that specifying,
distributing and updating the signatures of the attacks is not feasible [9] in these
environments. Instead, anomaly detection is easier to apply since the normality
model can be created and updated in each node from its own observations. Hence,
abnormal behaviours in the speciﬁc context of a particular node, even if they
are within the boundaries of the protocol speciﬁcations, can be detected. Garcia-
Teodoro et al. [10] present an extensive review of the most popular techniques
used in anomaly detection, which can be roughly classiﬁed into statistical based,
knowledge based, and machine learning based. The most signiﬁcant challenges
of anomaly detection are also mentioned, namely low detection eﬃciency and
high false positive rate, low throughput and high cost, absence of appropriate
metrics and assessment methodologies for evaluating and comparing diﬀerent
techniques, protection of the intrusion detection mechanism from attacks, and
analysis of ciphered data. In our work we conﬁrm that the classic metrics used in
wired or fully connected wireless networks are not appropriate in IC-MANET.
We believe comparisons on common simulation platforms (as long as the authors
make their code accessible to other researchers) is a ﬁrst step for comparative
evaluation.
Although anomaly detection for IC-MANET has to be geared towards pro-
tocols that in fact manage the challenges of multiple partitions – what we aim to
address in this paper – we would like to name a few precursors for anomaly de-
tection in MANET. Nakayama et al. [11] propose an adaptive method to detect
attacks on the AODV routing protocol. The method is based on the calcula-
tion of projection distances using multidimensional statistics and the Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the axis that expresses the most rel-
evant data correlations. Cabrera et al. [12] propose a method to detect attacks
on AODV and OLSR protocols. The method consists of three hierarchical and
distributed intrusion detection modules based on pattern recognition and clas-
siﬁer fusion. Liu et al. [9] too present a method to detect attacks on the AODV
routing protocol. The method is based on the combination of two data mining
approaches over data obtained from the MAC and network layers. The technique
allows the identiﬁcation of the MAC address of the attacker, although it can be
easily spoofed. Later, a Bayesian method is used to correlate local and global
alerts. It also proposes a collaborative decision mechanism among nodes in the
radio transmission range. These approaches are not applicable to our problem
area. First due to the manycast nature of dissemination and secondly due to the
intermittent connectivity in disaster area networks.
Among the few works that address intrusion detection in IC-MANET, there
is work by Chuah et al. [13] proposing a rule-based misuse detection mechanism
targeted towards delay-tolerant networks. It builds on a history-based routing
protocol, detects attacker nodes, and mitigates their eﬀects by keeping them on
a black list, i.e. through isolation. Other security-related work in IC-MANET is
concerned with prevention, e.g. Scalavino et al. [14] who propose an authorisation
scheme to protect the data exchanged in disaster events.
A main challenge of anomaly detection in MANET [9] is that most of the
approaches do not succeed with localisation of the attack sources. There is no
prior trust relationship among the network nodes, and network operation relies
on altruism and cooperation of neighbour nodes. Also the fact that nodes fail to
respond, e.g. through network congestion, link failure, or topology changes, can
be confused with intrusions [15], producing high false positive rates.
The metrics used on intrusion detection in MANET are usually based on the
accounting for detection rate and false positive rate typically presented as ROC
curves. In most cases these metrics reﬂect the number of attacks detected, but
sometimes they show the number of attackers detected [13]. The detection delay
is not usually taken into account, but there are a few exceptions [16, 17, 13].
There are approaches that quantify the impact of the detectors, such as network
overhead or the CPU speed-up [18], or data delivery ratio to evaluate the impact
of attack response [13]. In this paper we also advocate the use of delivery ratio
and total transmissions (as an indicator of overhead) for evaluation purposes.
Finally, response and mitigation of attacks is one of the topics that has not
been considered much in the intrusion detection literature for wireless ad-hoc
environments. Some MANET works [16, 19] just mention it and propose certain
actions, but do not really apply it. There are a few exceptions in which mitigation
is really applied [13, 20]. In addition to the network performance metrics to
show the beneﬁts of the approaches, the work by Wang et al. [20] also proposes
metrics to decide whether it is worth to enable the mitigation or not. This is
an interesting direction that should be explored within IC-MANET too, but we
postpone it to future works.
3 Protocol description and threat model
3.1 Protocol description
The Random Walk Gossip (RWG) is a message dissemination protocol for in-
termittently connected networks that has been presented and evaluated in a
previous publication [3]. Here we will try to provide just as much information as
needed to understand the threat model that we have used.
The protocol is designed to cope with the challenges faced in disaster area
networks such as intermittent connectivity, scarcity of bandwidth and energy, as
well as unknown and unpredictable network topologies with partitions. RWG is
a manycast protocol, which means that a message is intended to reach a given
number k of nodes. When k nodes have been reached, the message is k-delivered
and does not need to be propagated anymore, thus not wasting energy. RWG is
based on a store-and-forward mechanism, i.e. each node keeps the messages to
forward in a local buﬀer until they have been delivered. This mechanism prevents
the loss of messages because of network partitions.
When a message is sent in a connected part of the network, it will perform a
random walk over the nodes, until all the nodes in the partition are informed of
this message. This walk is controlled by a three-way packet exchange shown in
Figure 1. First a Request to Forward (REQF), that includes the message payload,
is sent by the current custodian of the message (indicated as grey in the picture).
The neighbouring nodes that hear the REQF reply with an acknowledgement
packet (ACK). The custodian chooses one of these nodes randomly and sends an
OK to Forward (OKTF) to this node indicating that it will be the next custodian.
The other nodes will retain the message without actively disseminating it. They
will keep the message as inactive until it expires. Partitions can be overcome
by the movement of nodes. Thus, new uninformed nodes will be informed by
some node that keeps the message as inactive and restarts to disseminate. This
process will continue as long as no more uninformed nodes remain in the network
or the message is k-delivered.
Fig. 1: Random Walk Gossip
All the packet types share the same header structure. In order to keep track of
which nodes have seen a given message, each packet header contains a bit vector
called the informed vector. When a node receives the message it produces a hash
of its own address and puts a 1 in the bit vector in the ﬁeld corresponding to the
hash. This allows the protocol to know when a message is k-delivered, and to tell
the potential future recipients of the message how far the message has reached
towards its dissemination goal (summing the number of 1’s indicates the current
known local knowledge on this). The informed vector also indicates which nodes
have received the message. If a node A hears a new neighbour B, then A will go
through the messages stored in its buﬀer to see if B has not yet been informed of
any of the messages, in which case those messages will be reactivated and sent
to node B (and other uninformed nodes in the vicinity).
Finally, when a node realises that a message is k-delivered it sends a Be
Silent (BS) packet to its vicinity. This packet will cause all receiving nodes to
also realise that the message is k-delivered and thus remove it from their buﬀers.
No new BS packets are sent upon the reception of a BS packet.
3.2 Threat model
Routing and dissemination protocols for MANET are usually based on cooper-
ation of the network nodes and assume fair play. RWG is not an exception and
an attacker can take advantage of it. There are many ways a malicious node can
attempt to disrupt the dissemination activity in a network. This paper focuses
on the mitigation of low-cost attacks which are consistent with the protocol spec-
iﬁcation. We study how a disrupting node will try to impact the dissemination
and resource usage of the network without investing too much of its own energy
resources. Recall that the only packet type with a payload is the REQF packet.
This is also the one that claims more in terms of transmission energy and band-
width. Using forged inexpensive ACKs three aspects of the protocol operation
can be attacked:
– Discovery of new nodes: RWG discovers new nodes in the vicinity by
listening to the packets the node receives. Each time a packet is received
the messages stored in the local buﬀer are checked to see if they have been
