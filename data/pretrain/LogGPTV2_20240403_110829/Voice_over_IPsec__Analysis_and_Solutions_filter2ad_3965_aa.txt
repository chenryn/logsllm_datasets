Abstract
In this paper we present the results of the experimental
analysis  of  the  transmission  of  voice  over  secure
communication  links  implementing  IPsec.  Critical
parameters  characterizing  the  real-time  transmission  of
voice  over  an  IPsec-ured  Internet  connection,  as  well  as
techniques that could be adopted to overcome some of the
limitations of VoIPsec (Voice over IPsec), are presented.
Our  results  show  that  the  effective  bandwidth  can  be
reduced  up  to  50%  with  respect  to  VoIP  in  case  of
VoIPsec.  Furthermore,  we  show  that  the  cryptographic
engine may hurt the perfomance of voice traffic because of
the  impossibility  to  schedule  the  access  to  it  in  order  to
prioritize traffic.
We  present  an  efficient  solution  for  packet  header
compression,  which  we  call  cIPsec,  for  VoIPsec  traffic.
Simulation  results  show  that  the  proposed  compression
scheme  significantly  reduces  the  overhead  of  packet
headers,  thus  increasing  the  effective  bandwidth  used  by
the  transmission.  In  particular,  when  cIPsec  is  adopted,
the average packet size is only 2% bigger than in the plain
case  (VoIP),  which  makes  VoIPsec  and  VoIP  equivalent
from the bandwidth usage point of view.

Introduction
The  Internet  community  agrees  that  security  is  one  of
the  key  properties  that  should  characterize  any  ICT
(Information and Communication Technology) system and
application, with particular emphasis on those that rely on
the  Internet  for  their  very  nature,  e.g.,  e-commerce.
Unfortunateley,  security  does  not  come  for  free  and,  in
general,  security  and  efficiency  are  conflicting
requirements.  While  for  a  broad  class  of  Internet
applications such a fact has limited effects, there is a class
of applications whose functionality may be compromised
by  security  controls,  namely  real-time  applications,  i.e.,
applications  that  impose  time  constraints  on  packet
delivery  in  order  to  reproduce  the  original  source  of
information.  As  an  example  of  such  applications
videoconferencing,  VoIP  (Voice  over  IP),  or  real-time
video  can  be  considered.  In  all  these  applications,
introducing  a  layer  that  guarantees  packet  content
confidentiality, integrity and authentication can slow down
packet transmission, which may not be acceptable by the
application itself.
In this paper we present the results of the experimental
analys  of  the  transmission  of  voice  over  secure
communication links implementing IPsec. The goal of our
investigation  is  to  understand  whether  the  current  VoIP
applications  can  simply  be  replaced  by  VoIPsec  (Voice
over IPsec) once   IPsec has become widely deployed. We
adopted  an  experimental  approach  in  order  to  be  able  to
actually  quantify  the  critical  parameters  for  the  VoIP
application  (e.g.,  delays  introduced  by  routers  internal
computations,  queueing  delays  experienced  by  packets
when waiting to be routed). Experiments were conducted
in  order  to  estimate  such  parameters  when  voice  is
transmitted  over  an  IPsec  channel.  Based  on  these
observations, we propose a compression scheme for IPsec
packet headers.
Various  aspects  have  to  be  considered  in  order  to
address the problem of real-time transmission over secure
channels,  in  particular  VoIPsec.  The  real-time  nature  of
the  problem  poses  some  constraints.  In  the  case  of  voice
transmission,  the  maximum  acceptable  delay  in  packet
delivery for optimal voice quality is 150ms, which can be
extended  up 
in  case  of  encrypted
communications.  Thus,  in  a  standard  VoIP  application,
after the signal has been digitized, there are 150ms to code
the  signal  using  some  standard  scheme  [e.g.,  ITU
standards  G.729,  G.723,  etc.],  divide  it  into  packets  and
encapsulate  the  packets  into  IP  packets,  then  route  the
packets on the Internet, and reconstruct the original traffic
stream  at  the  destination,  where  it  usually  is  buffered  in
to  200ms

order  to  smooth  the  jitter.  Because  of  such  a  timing
constraint,  voice  packets  are  small  (10-50  bytes  long
payload) in order to guarantee that all the above mentioned
operations  can  be  performed  within  the  given  time
constraint.  When  IPsec  is  considered,  the  in  packet  size
increases due to the IPsec specific headers (ESP, AH, new
IP  header  for  tunnelling)  added  to  each  packet.  This
significantly increases the ratio of header size to payload
size,  thus  reducing  the  effective  bandwidth,  i.e.,  the
percentage  of  bandwidth  carrying  actual  data  w.r.t.  the
total  bandwidth  used.  Furthermore, the  time  necessary to
build  such  headers  and 
the  necessary
cryptographic  functions  to  the  payload  introduces
additional delay to packet trasmission.

decrease  up  to  63%  in  case  of  VoIPsec  w.r.t.  VoIP,

connections (e.g., via modem). The most interesting result
is, however, related to the cryptographic engine, or crypto-
engine. It is not surprising that for voice traffic the crypto-
engine  can  be  a  serious  bottleneck.  What  is  not
immediately  evident  is  the  actual  rational  of  such  a
behavior.  Rather  than  the  expected  constraints  on  the
crypto-engine throughput, the critical factor turned out to
be the impossibility to control and schedule access to the
crypto-engine so as to favor real-time traffic over regular
one.  This  applies  regardless  of  whether  the  scheduler  is
implemented  as  a  software  module  or  a  hardware
component.  Therefore, if  voice  traffic is  interleaved  with
other  types  of  traffic,  e.g.,  ftp  or  http  traffic,  during  a
secure  session,  it  may  happen  that  the  latter  (usually
characterized  by  big  packets)  is  scheduled  in  the  crypto-
engine before voice traffic. In this case voice traffic might
be delayed to the point that packets are discarded most of
the times.
Finally,  we  present  a  new  compression  scheme  that
allows  to  improve  the  effective  bandwidth  used  by
VoIPsec  applications.  Our  compression  scheme  reduces
the size of the internal headers of a voice packet, based on
the  observation  that  some  of  the  information  they  carry
does  not  change.  By  adopting  our  compression  scheme,
VoIPsec  packets  are  only  2%  longer  than  regular  VoIP
packets, rather than 50% longer plain VoIPsec packets.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a
quick  overview  of  VoIP.  Section  3  describes  the  testbed
used  for  our  experiments.  Section  4  presents  the
experimental  results  of  the  analysis  of  VoIP  over  IPsec.
Section 5 describes the proposed compression scheme and
the  measured  performance  when  it  is  adopted.  Section  6
concludes the paper and summarizes our findings.

 Preliminaries
In  this  section  we  describe  the  problems  occurring
when voice is transmitted on a computer network and how
they change when functions that guarantee confidentiality
and authentication of   the communication are introduced,
namely IPsec.  The technologies involved are:
•  VoIP,  the  application  for  digitizing,  compressing
and  converting  voice  into  IP  packets,  and
transmitting them over IP networks;
IPsec, the module for encryption and authentication
of information at network layer;
• 
•  QoS protocols, that ensure voice quality when it is
transmitted over IP networks.
In the following we briefly recall the basic techniques
involved in each technology.
2.1 Voice over IP
VoIP is a technique for transmitting voice data over the
Internet [2, 4]. The following steps are performed:
• 
• 
• 
• 
digitization of the analog signal, usually performed
at a frequency of 8 KHz with 8 bit per sample, thus
generating 64Kbytes per second;
packet generation of the digital signal according to
the TCP-UDP/IP protocols;
transmission of the packets on the network;
packet reception and analog signal reconstruction at
the destination.
When sending voice traffic over IP networks, a number
of factors contribute to overall voice quality as perceived
by  an  end  user.  Some  of  the  most  important  factors  are
end-to-end  delay  in  the  voice  carrier  path  and  degraded
voice  quality.  Among  the  factors  that  degrade  voice
quality  are  packet  loss,  delay  variation,  or  jitter,  voice
compression  schemes,  transducers  (microphones  and
speakers), echo cancellation algorithms, and voice activity
detection  at  voice  endpoints.  In  this  paper  we  focus  on
end-to-end delay and packet loss.
VoIP  is  a  typical  real-time  application  as  the  original
signal has to be reproduced at the destination as close as
possible to the instant when it was generated, therefore the
signal  delay  is  a  qualifiying  parameter  for  VoIP
application. Each of the steps mentioned before introduces
some  delay  in  packet  transmission.  ITU  G.  114
recommendation suggests to contain such a delay within a
limit of 150 ms for wired communication lines and within
250-300  ms  for  satellite  based  communications.  Various
factors influence signal delay during a VoIP transmission.
The  time  spent  by  the  CODEC,  the  device  that  performs
the  digitization  process,  may  vary  between  0.75-30ms,
depending on the coding schemes adopted and the quality
of the reproduced signal. The queueing delay (i.e., the time
spent  by  a  packet  in  the  router  buffers  waiting  for  being
routed) may add up to 30 ms. A further delay in the range
of 40-70ms, called jitter delay, is introduced by buffering
arriving packets so that they can be delivered at a uniform
rate.  Buffering  is  necessary  to  eliminate  the  variation  of

network load.

that  can  be  performed  with  up  to  date  technology  given
channels  with  different  bandwidth  and  different  payload

Table  2  reports  the  main  characteristic  in  terms  of  bit
rate  (in  Kbps),  compression  delay  (in  ms)  and  Mean
Opinion Score (MOS) for a set of algorithms that can be
adopted by CODECs [2]. The MOS is a parameter used to
measure  the  quality  of  the  signal  reproduced  by  such
algorithms and ranges from 1 to 5, 1 being the worst case.
As  the  table  shows,  the  best  algorithm  is  significantly
better  than  the  rest,  which  obtain  a  MOS  in  the

With  VoIP,  voice  is  sent  to  the  destination  using  an
RTP  (Real-time  Transport  Protocol)  that  operates  above
UDP [4]. A TCP connection between the two peers is used
to set up and tear down calls, to negotiate capabilities and
to set up the RTP channel, which is then used to transmit
data. To guarantee the security of the communication, both
the TCP and the RTP channels have to be encrypted and
authenticated.  A  reasonable  choice  to  implement  such
functionalities is IPsec.
2.2 IPsec
IPsec  [6]  provides  security  services  for  IP  traffic  by
allowing a host to set up a secure IP channel with any peer
it  wishes  to  connect  to.  The  host  can  choose  different
services depending  on  the  level of security required. The
services provided by IPsec are based on two protocols: an
authentication  protocol  (AH)  and  a  combined  encryption
and  authentication  protocol  (ESP).  The  first  protocol
provides  services  such  as  connectionless  integrity  and
sender  authentication,  while  the  second  protocol  is  in
charge  of  guaranteeing  confidentiality  among  other
