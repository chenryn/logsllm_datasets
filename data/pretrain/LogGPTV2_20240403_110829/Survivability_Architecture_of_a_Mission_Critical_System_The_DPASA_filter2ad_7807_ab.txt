### Zones and Operations in the Defense-Enabled JBI

#### Overview of Zones and Quads
The defense-enabled JBI (Joint Battle Information) system is organized into several zones, each with specific roles and functionalities. These zones include the Crumple Zone, Operations Zone, and Executive Zone. Each zone is further divided into four quads (Quad A, Quad B, Quad C, and Quad D), which provide redundancy and fault tolerance.

**Crumple Zone:**
- **Access Proxy (AP) Host:** The AP host serves as the entry point for all traffic between the clients and the Core. It runs proxies that perform rate limiting, size-checking, and application-level checks without compromising end-to-end authentication and encryption.

**Operations Zone:**
- **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS):** Deployed in each quad, NIDS monitors ingress and egress traffic on the LAN and sends alerts to the Correlator (CORR).
- **PSQ Host:** Runs the PSQ server, augmented by Guardians to check the size, frequency, and rate of requests and report anomalies to the System Manager (SM).
- **Policy Server (PS) Host:** Manages ADF NICs and interfaces with the SM for adaptive responses.
- **Correlator (CORR) Host:** Receives alerts, generates advice, correlates alerts, and displays them on the SM's visual interface.
- **Downstream Controller (DC) Host:** Processes heartbeat messages and acts as a proxy for the SM, ensuring the SM is not directly exposed to the Crumple Zone.

**Executive Zone:**
- **System Manager (SM) Host:** Manages Core components, presents a user interface for security operators, and controls ADF NICs.

#### Protection Domains
To enhance security and impede attack propagation, DPASA (Distributed Policy and Security Architecture) uses three protection domains:

1. **Network Protection Domain:**
   - Protects network traffic, restricts attack points, and prevents misuse.
2. **System Protection Domain:**
   - Ensures host integrity by preventing modifications to critical system files and application resources. Enforces least-privilege at the host level.
3. **Process Domain:**
   - Restricts system calls and enforces additional constraints on applications.

#### Protocols
DPASA utilizes several protocols for communication and coordination:

- **Registration Protocol:** Used by clients to join the JBI. Involves mutual authentication between the client and the SM.
- **Alert Protocols:** Clients and the Core use these to alert each other of potential issues.
- **PSQ Protocol:** Implements publish, subscribe, and query in a fault-tolerant manner, ensuring correct behavior even if one PSQ server is compromised.
- **Heartbeat Protocol:** Detects failures in survivability components. Heartbeat messages are sent to the Core and used by the SM to display system status.
- **SM Protocols:** Control ADF NICs, manage quorum groups, and gather component status.

### Network Topology of the Defense-Enabled JBI

#### Redundant Core LANs
- The defense-enabled JBI has four Core LANs (quads) instead of one, providing redundancy.
- Services are hosted on redundant hardware using different operating systems (SELinux, Windows, and Solaris).

#### Hosts in Each Zone
- **Crumple Zone:** One host per quad (QXAP).
- **Executive Zone:** One host per quad (QXSM).
- **Operations Zone:** Five hosts per quad (QXNIDS, QXDC, QXPSQ, QXCORR, QXPS).

#### Client LAN Configuration
- Clients are organized into four LANs, with a NIDS added to each LAN for monitoring.

#### Network Defense-in-Depth
- **VPN Routers:** Establish a VPN trunk from each client LAN to each Core LAN.
- **ADF NICs:** Equipped on all hosts, with crumple zone hosts having two ADF NICs (one client-facing, one Core-facing).
- **Managed Switches:** Control communication between quads and within zones. Controlled by Quadrant Isolation Switches (QIS) managed by the SMs.
- **Quadrant Isolation Switches (QIS):** Allow security operators to isolate an entire quad by cutting off power to the managed switch, requiring a quorum of three SMs.
- **Layer 3 Switch:** Simulates the public IP network, with client and core LANs implemented as VLANs.

#### Host Protection Policies
- **Host Protection Domain Policies:** Define process start-up and limit capabilities.
- **Local Controllers (LCs):** Monitor file system integrity, CPU, memory, and disk usage, and report policy violations.
- **Client LCs:** Run three instances that monitor each other and can take over if one crashes.

#### Data and Control Flows
- **Heartbeats:** Sent by each software component to the Core.
- **Alerts:** Sent by NIDS, Host Intrusion Detection Systems, LCs, and software components to the Core.
- **Coordination and Command Messages:** Sent by SMs to each other and to other components, sometimes via DCs.
- **PS-ADF NIC Communication:** For status/heartbeats, key renewal, and audit messages.

All communications between a client LAN and the Core, previously routed in the undefined JBI, are now protected and controlled through these layers of defense and protocols.
