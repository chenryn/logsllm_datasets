I am a beginner of pyTorch. I installed a non-cuda pyTorch on my machine,
which clearly has no gpu installed, and run the simplest backward() function.
But it didn't work out with the following exception:
THCudaCheck FAIL file=torch/csrc/autograd/engine.cpp line=353 error=35 : CUDA
driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version  
Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "", line 1, in  
File "/u/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/torch/autograd/variable.py", line
146, in backward  
self._execution_engine.run_backward((self,), (gradient,), retain_variables)  
RuntimeError: cuda runtime error (35) : CUDA driver version is insufficient
for CUDA runtime version at torch/csrc/autograd/engine.cpp:353
How can I fix it? Thanks!
