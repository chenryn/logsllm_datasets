User: How to use the fail2ban tool to monitor login attempts on a server and automatically block IP addresses with malicious intent?
Assistant: Here are the steps to use the fail2ban tool to monitor login attempts on your server and automatically block IP addresses with malicious intent: 1. Install the fail2ban tool On Ubuntu systems, it can be installed with the following command: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install fail2ban 2. Create a fail2ban configuration file Create a new file named jail.local in the /etc/fail2ban directory and add the following code: [DEFAULT] ignoreip = 127.0.0.1 bantime = 3600 findtime = 300 maxretry = 3 [sshd] enabled = true port = ssh filter = sshd logpath = /var/log/auth.log maxretry = 6 filter.d/sshd.conf Then, create a file named sshd.conf in the /etc/fail2ban/filter.d directory Create a new file and add the following code: [Definition] failregex = ^.*Failed (?:password|publickey) for .* from <HOST>.*$ ignoreregex = 3. Restart fail2ban service After completing the above steps, restart fail2ban Service: sudo service fail2ban restart Now fail2ban will monitor the server for ssh login attempts and automatically block IP addresses with more than 3 consecutive failed attempts within a period of time. It will block malicious IP connections for 10 minutes and automatically unblock them after that time period is over. Note: Use the fail2ban tool with caution, as users who actually try to log in to the system but have the wrong password will be blocked and thus have no chance to log in normally. The best strategy to avoid failures is to develop appropriate measures and initial installation images early and disallow the use of password-based authentication.
