When selecting "Restart and Update" from either the release notes page or the Atom menu, Atom closes but fails to restart. Additionally, when manually restarting Atom, the update is not applied. 

I have attempted to resolve this issue by clearing the `~/.atom/storage` directory, as suggested in a related post, but the problem persists.

**Platform:** macOS 10.10.3, Atom 0.201.0
