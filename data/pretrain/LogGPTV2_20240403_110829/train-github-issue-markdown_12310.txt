Clicking "Restart and Update" from the release notes page or the Atom menu
causes Atom to close and fail to restart. Moreover, upon restarting manually,
Atom is not updated.
I have tried clearing the ~/.atom/storage directory, as suggested here but it
doesn't solve the problem here.
Platform: OSX 10.10.3, Atom 0.201.0
