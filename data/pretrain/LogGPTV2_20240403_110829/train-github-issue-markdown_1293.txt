It would be cool if electron would serve as the go to platform for web devs

Native mobile is key because of the convenience of having an app sit on your
phone rather than in a browser tab somewhere. Could be popular because a lot
of the apps built on electron are already responsive.
Thoughts on implementation: Android -> Webviews, IOS -> ??
