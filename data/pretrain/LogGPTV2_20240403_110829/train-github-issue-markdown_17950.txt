When retrieving data from an API, dates are typically represented as strings rather than `Date` objects. When I attempt to use Angular's `DatePipe` on a date string, such as `"2014-11-20T05:11:03.277+00:00"`, I encounter the following error: `Invalid argument '2014-11-20T05:11:03.277+00:00' for pipe 'DatePipe'`.

It is worth noting that in AngularJS (Angular 1), the `date` filter worked seamlessly with date strings in this format.
