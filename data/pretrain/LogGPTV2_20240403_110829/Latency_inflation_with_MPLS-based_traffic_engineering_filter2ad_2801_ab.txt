#### Analysis and Discussion

To address the challenges posed by the size of the topology (resulting in a large-scale linear programming problem) and the volatility of traffic demand, we divided the time into 5-minute intervals and computed the optimal Traffic Engineering (TE) strategy for each interval using the method described above. Compared to optimal routing, we found that MPLS-based routing incurs an overall 10% to 22% increase in weighted byte latency over different snapshots spanning a one-day period.

**Figure 7** compares the latency at different traffic volume percentiles under the optimal and MPLS-TE strategies in a typical interval. There is a substantial latency gap between the two TE strategies—the relative latency difference remains above 30% at the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of traffic volume. **Figure 8** plots the 99th percentile byte latency under both TE strategies during an entire day. Except between midnight and early morning hours, the latency under MPLS-TE is consistently 20 ms (35%-40%) higher than that under the optimal TE, indicating significant room for improvement.

### Patterns in Latency Inflation

LSP latency inflation is triggered when an LSP switches from a short to a long path. We studied the patterns of LSP path changes to determine if they cluster at certain links, routers, data center (DC) pairs, or time periods. Although there are many LSP path changes, we focused only on those causing a latency spike (e.g., a latency increase of more than 20 ms and 20%) and referred to them as Large Latency Path Changes (LLPCs). We ignored the remaining path changes as they either have little impact on latency or reduce it. For an LLPC, we attribute it to the old path rather than the new one because it is triggered by insufficient bandwidth on the former.

**Correlation with Links, Routers, and DC Pairs:**
- **Figure 9(a):** The y-axis on the left shows the number of LLPCs per link sorted in increasing order, and the y-axis on the right shows the cumulative fraction of LLPCs observed by the links. The x-axis is normalized to anonymize the total number of links.
- **Figure 9(b) and 9(c):** Similar curves for routers and DC pairs, respectively.

From these figures, we find that LLPCs occur mostly at a small fraction of links and DC pairs. The top 10% of links and DC pairs account for 80% and 95% of the LLPCs, respectively. This pattern is also true for routers, although less pronounced. Our analysis suggests that the latency inflation problem could be significantly alleviated by adding capacity to a small subset of links.

**Correlation with Time:**
- **Figure 10(a):** Plots the number of LLPCs for each (link, time-bin) pair in increasing order and the cumulative fraction of LLPCs of all pairs. It shows that LLPCs are highly concentrated at certain links and times. 1% of the (link, time-bin) pairs witness 80% of the LLPCs.
- **Figure 10(b) and 10(c):** Similar patterns for (router, time-bin) and (DC-pair, time-bin) pairs, respectively.

Since bandwidth change is the primary cause of LSP path changes (§2.2), this concentration is likely due to dramatic traffic surges in those (link, time-bin) pairs.
