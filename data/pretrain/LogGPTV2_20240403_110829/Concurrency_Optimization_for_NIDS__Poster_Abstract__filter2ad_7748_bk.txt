Overall, 54 primary and 13 secondary metabolites were selected significantly discriminant (VIP > 1, p  DOM 7 > DOM 9, 11, at 96 h The grain 
milling significantly affected titratable acidity (DOM 0, 5 > DOM 7 > DOM 9, 11) and amino type nitrogen contents (DOM 5, 7 > DOM 0, 9, 11) in koji In 
conclusion, the rice substrate preprocessing between DOM 5–7 was potentially ideal, with the end product being rich in distinctive nutritional and 
functional metabolites The study rationalizes the grain preprocessing steps vital for commercial koji making

during Growth Stages
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dedi Satria, Kyushu University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Dedi Satria, Sonam Tamrakar, Hiroto Suhara, Shuhei Kaneko, Kuniyoshi Shimizu
Lingzhi (Chinese) or reishi (Japanese) is a Ganoderma mushroom species which has wide range of bioactivities Analysis of metabolites changes 
during growth stages of lingzhi are important to understand underlying mechanism of its biosynthesis as well as bioactivity It may provide valuable 
information for cultivation efficiency of lingzhi In this study, mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics was carried out to analyze the 
alteration of metabolites during subsequent growth stages of lingzhi Eight growth stages were categorized on the basis of morphological changes, 
starting from mycelium stage to post-mature stage of lingzhi GC-MS and LC-MS analyses along with multivariate analysis of lingzhi growth 
stages were performed Amino acids, organic acids, sugars, polyols, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and some small polar metabolites were extracted 
as chemical markers from GC-MS analysis; while, lanostane-type triterpenoids were annotated from LC-MS analysis of lingzhi The markers 
from untargeted analysis of lingzhi growth stages were correlated with alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity The current result shows that some 
metabolites are involved in the growth process and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of lingzhi

Comprehensive metabolomic analysis of sesame seeds
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Bo Mi Lee, Kookmin University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Eun Mi Lee, Byeung Kon Shin, Dong Jin Kang , Do Yup Lee
Sesames are enriched with amino acid, essential fatty acids, carbohydrates, and hydroxy acid The nutritional characteristics are mainly influenced 
by a range of environmental factors (eg climate and soil) as well as genetic factors In current study, we analyzed the integrated metabolic profiles 
of sesame seeds grown in 29 Korean domestic provinces, 5 Chinese provinces, and 4 other countries (Nigeria, Ethiopia, India, and Pakistan) A 
total of 243 primary and secondary metabolites were acquired using gas-chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and 
liquid-chromatography Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap MS) PLS-DA model primarily discriminated the sesames cultivated in Korea 
from Chinese one and those of 5 other countries Based on the model, variable importance in projection (VIP) analysis prioritized 7 metabolites; 
glycerol, D-raffinose, DL-carnitine, histamine, 9-oxo-10(E), 12(E)-octadecadienoic acid, glycerophospho-N-palmitoyl ethanolamine, and palmitic 
acid Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis validated the discriminant power in area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0916 – 0996 
Particularly, the Korean sesames were best featured by higher abundances in a range of amino acids relative to Chinese and other countries’ 
sesame Further detailed interrogation was performed on 29 Korean sesames to examine if metabolomic profiles can distinguish the subtle regional 
differences Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) proposed unbiased clusters of the sesames according to longitudinal coordination The pathway 
overrepresentation analysis identified region-specific chemical categories as follows: aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, alanine-
aspartate-glutamate metabolism, and pentose-glucuronate interconversions This study can be generalized under more controlled experiment, and 
applied to authentic decisions for cultivation origin of domestic agricultural products

Pigmented sorghum polyphenols as potential inhibitors of amylolytic enzymes: An in vitro study combining starch digestion 
and untargeted metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Gabriele Rocchetti, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Italy
CO-AUTHORS: Gianluca Giuberti, Marco Trevisan, Luigi Lucini
Polyphenols characterizing pigmented sorghum (PS) flours were in vitro evaluated as possible modulators of the activity of starch digestive 
enzymes Flours from five PS varieties were analyzed after cooking and compared to white sorghum (WS) flour An untargeted metabolomic 
approach comprehensively depicted the bound and free phenolic composition of each flour, highlighting a high distribution of flavonoids (ie, 
anthocyanins, flavanol and flavone equivalents) and phenolic acids, with differences across samples All PS flours were characterized by greater 
tannin and kafirin contents when compared to WS Following in vitro digestion, all cooked PS flours showed greater resistant starch (RS) (from 
42 to 214 g /100 g dry matter), as well as lower starch hydrolysis index (HI) when compared to WS Multivariate statistics following untargeted 
metabolomics showed that anthocyanins and flavanol equivalents characterizing PS were the most discriminant compounds during the in vitro 
digestion In addition, kafirin and total tannin contents (on raw ingredients) along with the anthocyanin profiles and the RS (on cooked samples) were 
negative correlated with HI Therefore, PS flours might be useful in the formulation of foods characterized by likely functional properties

Untargeted metabolomics for the investigation of fish intake biomarkers
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Xiaofei Yin, University College Dublin, Ireland
CO-AUTHORS: Helena Gibbons, Gary Frost, Lorraine Brennan
Background: Fish intake has been reported to associate with certain health benefits; however accurate assessment of fish intake is still problematic 
The objective of this study was to identify fish intake biomarkers and examine their potential for quantifying intake Materials and methods: In the 
NutriTech study, ten participants were randomized into fish group and consumed increasing quantities (88 to 412 g/day) of fish for three days/
week during three weeks Fasting and postprandial urine samples were analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and LC-MS Dietary biomarkers were 
identified by multivariate data analysis and confirmed in National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS) cohort A calibration curve was developed and 
used to determine fish intake based on urinary biomarker levels Results: Multivariate data analysis of fasting urine samples collected in NutriTech 
study revealed good discrimination between high (412 g/day) and low (88 g/day) fish intakes Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), dimethylamine and 
dimethyl sulfone were identified and displayed significant dose response with fish intake (P < 005) Furthermore fish consumption yielded greater 
increase in urinary TMAO compared to red meat In the NANS cohort, urinary TMAO levels were significantly higher in fish consumers compared 
to non-consumer (P < 001) However, the overall correlation between fish intake and TMAO (0148, P < 001) were poor LC-MS analysis revealed 
prominent increases in indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate excretion after high fish intake Conclusion: Urinary TMAO displayed strong dose-
response relationship with fish intake; however, use of TMAO alone is insufficient to determine fish intake in a free living population

Citrus unshiu is the most popular citrus in Japan There are still no study biomarkers of the consumption of citrus using Citrus unshiu, necessitating 
their further screening The present study aimed to investigate biomarkers and compare metabolites in plasma and urine following the consumption 
of several foods The subjects were eight healthy men (age: 239 ± 11 years, BMI: 211 ± 26 kg/m²) who participated in a randomized crossover trial 
The test foods were apple, Cirus unshiu, broccoli, and seaweed (100g of each) that were consumed a single time a week Metabolomic analysis was 
conducted on plasma samples from before consuming the test food and from 2 h after consumption and on urine samples from before consumption, 
2 h and 4 h after consumption using CE-TOFMS On analyzing the test foods, concentrations of Proline betaine were significantly higher in Citrus 
unshiu compared with concentrations following the consumption of the other foods in both of the plasma samples and urine samples Of these, 
concentrations of Proline betaine and trans-Aconitate were significantly increased following the consumption of Citrus unshiu compared with those 
following the consumption of the other foods at 2h and 4h in urine Candidate biomarkers of Citrus unshiu consumption were Proline betaine in 
plasma samples and urine samples We showed that Proline betaine was a biomarker of Citrus

Fermentation may enhance nutritional and functional properties of food by increase of bioactivity or bioavailability during the process, which 
may have preventive effects on human disease The study aimed to identify flavonoid metabolites of fermented soybean using an untargeted 
metabolomic approach and to investigate the effect of fermentation on bioavailability of flavonoids In the cross-over intervention study with 10 
study participants, standardized meals with fermented soybean (Cheonggukjang, fermented by Bacillus subtilis) and non-fermented soybean were 
served with a 1-week wash-out period in a randomized controlled trial Flavonoids in each freeze-dried tested meal and flavonoid metabolites 
in 24-hour urine and blood samples collected before and after the consumption of each tested meal were measured by UPLC-DAD-QTOF/MS 
Eighteen isoflavones, including genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and its glycosides, were identified in both tested meals In the fermented food, levels 
of simple glycoside forms (eg daidzin and genistin) with high bioavailability were higher than those in the non-fermented food, which might be 
explained by the degradation of malonylglucosides during the fermentation of soybean Fourteen metabolites including 7 glucuronides, 4 sulfates, 
and 3 sulfoglucuronides formed by conjugating enzymes were identified in urine and plasma, but equol and equol conjugated metabolites were 
not detected The level of genistein 4’,7-di-O-glucuronide was higher in the plasma collected after intake of fermented soybean when compared to 
non-fermented soybean The results of the study may contribute to understanding the potential health effects of fermented foods by modifying the 
bioavailability and biological activity of soybean bioactive compounds

Elicitors are agents, such as chemical compounds, that trigger defense responses in plants, including the synthesis of secondary metabolites, such 
as policosanol Policosanol consumption has various positive physiological effects in humans such as antioxidant capabilities, cholesterol-lowering 
activities, and improved liver function Oat sprouts are a natural source of policosanol, making them a popular health food The objective of this 
study was to test whether treatment of oat sprouts with organic acid salts and UV as an elicitor increases policosanol content compared with a 
control group of sprouts grown in water During the growing phase, oat sprouts were treated with 01% sodium chloride (NaCl), 01% acetic acid, and 
UV360 bulbs at a wavelength of; samples were analyzed for policosanol content 10 days after germination using GC/MS Results showed that 01% 
sodium chloride and 01% acetic acid treatments produced a policosanol concentration of 68184 mg / 100 g and 7364 mg / 100 g, respectively, 
compared with a water-grown control concentration of 5548 mg / 100 g The policosanol content in UV360-treated oat sprouts was also higher than 
that of the control sprouts at 6514 mg / 100 g In conclusion, cultivation of oat sprouts with organic acid salt supplementation and UV light treatment 
can significantly increase the levels of policosanol This protocol could be used to develop a potent functional food with increased market value

Self-reporting of dietary intake can be inaccurate and is prone to inherent bias Measurement of multiple food intake biomarkers in urine may offer 
an objective method for monitoring dietary intake when used in conjunction with self-reported measures In a randomised, controlled, crossover 
trial; participants four different diets (one per stay) over a 72 hour period, each with a stepwise variance in concordance with the World Health 
Organisation (WHO) healthy eating guidelines Spot urine samples and cumulative urine samples were collected daily for the duration of the 
intervention Urine samples were analysed using metabolite fingerprinting by both high-resolution flow infusion mass spectrometry (FIE-HRMS) 
and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) Absolute concentrations of selected dietary intake biomarkers were measured 
using liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS) and by integration of 1 H-NMR data Classification models for diet 
discrimination in spot, cumulative and 24-hour urine samples predicted dietary intake for all urine sampling time points Cross validation modelling 
using 1H NMR and FIE-HRMS data also demonstrated the power of spot and cumulative urine samples in predicting dietary patterns in 24-hour 
urines There was no significant loss of information when spot or cumulative samples were substituted for 24-hour urine samples The combination 
of high dimensional classification modelling and quantitative analysis shows that when using urinary metabolic profiles and biomarkers for 
assessment of dietary patterns, spot samples are suitable replacements for 24-hour urine samples

An integrated metabolomic and metagenomic analysis of Korean traditional alcoholic beverages using Nuruk
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jang Eun Lee, Korea Food Research Institute, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Jae Ho Kim
Nuruk is a fermentation starter used for brewing alcoholic beverages It is a kind of dough made from grains, such as wheat, barley, or rice, which 
are germinated by enzyme-releasing microorganisms Since Nuruk mainly consists of starch, microorganisms that are capable of degrading β-starch 
are prominent in Nuruk Specifically, various types of fungi, yeast and bacteria that cause alcoholic fermentation are present in Nuruk Thus, it is 
important to understand how they affect the quality of the alcoholic beverages during fermentation In this study, an integrated metabolomic and 
metagenomic approaches were used to generate the comprehensive metabolite and microbial profiles of Korean traditional alcoholic beverages 
produced by three different types of Nuruks selected from fifty-eight types of restored traditional Nuruk Different analytical techniques such as 
GC-MS and 1H NMR in combination with multivariate analyses were used to obtain the metabolomic profile of each alcoholic beverage as well as 
that of the fermentation process In addition, microbial communities were monitored to identify the correlative relationship between metabolites and 
microbes The results indicated that the volatile metabolites of Nuruk-based alcoholic beverages are likely to be affected by microbial diversity in 
Nuruk, whereas the non-volatile metabolites are affected by the ingredients of Nuruk These metabolomic profiles will be useful to identify how the 
metabolites and microorganisms of Nuruk affect the quality of alcoholic beverages Furthermore, these results will be of great significance towards 
forming the basis of further research to scientifically establish the values of fermented foods

Effects of estrogen deficiency on metabolic markers and gut microbiota in ovariectomized mice fed normal-fat diet
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Youngmin Lee, Department of Food and Nutrition, Seoul Women’s University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Jieun Jeong, Chi Young Yun
Estrogen deficiency is associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and increased insulin resistance, yet underlying mechanisms remain poorly 
understood This study was performed to investigate effects of estrogen deficiency on metabolic markers and gut microbiota in ovariectomized 
mice fed normal-fat diet C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks old) were sham operated or ovariectomized and after 3 weeks, assigned to the following 
groups: sham-operated mice fed with normal fat diet (S-NF); ovariectomized mice fed with normal fat diet (OVX-NF) Experimental diets were fed 
for 5 weeks At the end of the treatment, liver was isolated and serum was collected for biochemical analysis Total DNA from fecal samples was 
extracted Although there was no significant difference in food intake and weight gain due to ovariectomy in normal fat diet-fed mice, we observed 
a significant increase of liver weight and abdominal fat weight in OVX-NF group compared with S-NF group No significant difference was observed 
in relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Deferribacteres among group However, we observed that OVX-
NF group had increased the phylum Actinobacteria, and decreased the phylum Firmicutes compare to S-NF group (P<005) In our results, there 
is a negative correlation between adiponectin level and Firmicutes, and a positive correlation between abdominal fat weight and Actinobacteria 
(P<005) This study suggested that changes in the gut microbiota may be related to estrogen deficiency-induced metabolic disorders in 
postmenopausal women This study was carried out with the support of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea 
government (MSIT) (NRF- 2017R1C1B5018328)

Targeted phenolic metabolites of purple potatoes in plasma and urine of healthy men
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Johanna Jokioja, University of Turku, Finland
CO-AUTHORS: Johanna Jokioja, Kaisa M. Linderborg, Mark Philo, Jasmine Percival, Paul Kroon, Baoru Yang
The purple hue of the coloured potatoes is derived from natural polyphenolic colorants called anthocyanins Anthocyanins have a flavylium cation 
structure substituted with mono- or oligomeric sugars and in case of acylated anthocyanins, aliphatic or aromatic acids Interestingly, anthocyanin-
rich foods, such as berries, may be beneficial for health[1, 2] Our recent study showed that purple potatoes may decrease human postprandial blood 
glycaemia compared to yellow potatoes [3] The health effects of anthocyanin-rich foods may be contributed by their phenolic metabolites However, 
the metabolic fate of dietary anthocyanins is still relatively unknown Non-acylated anthocyanins are reported to be converted into glucuronide 
and sulphate conjugates and small phenolics[4] The metabolites of acylated anthocyanins have been scarcely studied Therefore, a cross-over 
clinical study was organized to investigate the phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine of healthy men after a meal rich in purple potato acylated 
anthocyanins The samples were cleaned using solid-phase extraction, and the targeted metabolites were detected using mass spectrometry in 
multiple reaction monitoring mode The anthocyanins were mainly of petunidin and peonidin glycosides acylated to hydroxycinnamic acids Our 
results suggest that purple potato anthocyanins are metabolized into phenolic metabolites, such as phloroglucinaldehyde, hydroxybenzoic acids 
and hydroxycinnamic acids, and to their glucuronides and sulfates [1] Li D et al (2015) J Nutr 145, 742–748 [2] Törrönen R et al (2010) Br J Nutr 103,

The gut microbiota, host organism, and diet trialogue in lactating mothers and its impact on early nutrition programming of their infants is 
spotlighted in nutrition research The analysis of the urinary metabolome provides a non-invasive means to determine a range of food intake and 
microbiome-specific biomarkers In this study, liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is proposed as a 
tool to study urinary metabolic biomarkers in lactating mothers and their term or preterm infants Urine samples were collected from 27 lactating 
mothers (M), 29 term infants (TI) (25 receiving own mother’s milk, OMM; 4 formula), and 47 preterm infants (PI) (20 receiving OMM, 20 donor human 
milk, DHM, and 7 formula) An untargeted LC-time-of-flight-MS assay was used for a comprehensive analysis of the urinary metabolome Metabolite 
annotation and integration was performed matching against an in-house library containing 41 food intake and microbiome-related biomarkers 
described in the literature Principal Component Analysis revealed characteristic patterns differentiating samples from M, PI, and TI Employing 
Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, significant differences between relative urinary biomarker concentrations of (i) M and TI, finding 
significant correlations for three food intake biomarkers, (ii) PI and TI and (iii) infants receiving OMM and formula were detected No difference was 
observed between PI fed with OMM and DHM The obtained results will be used for the development of a quantitative LC-MS-based method for 
studying the correlation between biomarkers and Food Frequency Questionnaires, as well as the composition of the gut microbiome

Metabolomic Profiling of Superfood Seeds in bakery products using a Benchtop GC Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Stefan Vinnenberg, LECO Instrumente GmbH, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Juergen Wendt
Around 20 years ago “superfood” started to be used as a marketing tool for selling specific foods, dietary supplements and food additives Although 
there is no exact definition of superfoods, one can be classified as food considered exceptionally good for one’s health and for boosting the immune 
system In the past few years chia seeds became one of the most popular superfoods As a result of the rapidly increasing demand for superfoods, 
the market is flooded with counterfeits In bakery products more expensive chia seeds are often replaced by cheaper flaxseed The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the metabolomic profile of chia, flax and sesame seeds, looking for chemical markers, which allow confirming the presence of such 
seeds in food products For sample preparation a well established derivatization protocol was applied, including a methoxymation step, followed 
by a silylation The samples were analyzed using a LECO Benchtop GC-Time-of-Flight Mass Mass Spectrometer A new TOF design has significantly 
improved the detection capability of the system, allowing for the safe identification and quantification of analytes, even at ultra-trace level Different 
strategies for data evaluation were compared Rosmarinic acid is best suited to distinguish between chia and other seeds The marker was identified 
by the usage of the Golm Metabolome Database By using this marker, alterations to bakery products can be easily uncovered

Truffle aroma characterisation of Australia grown black Périgord truffle (Tuber melanosporum) during shelf life
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Maike Bollen, Metabolomics Australia, UWA, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Kenny Choo, Gary Dykes, Joshua Ravensdale, Ranil Coorey
Truffles (Tuber melanosporum) are a high value commercial fungi traditionally produced in the northern hemisphere The unique flavour and its 
rarity is due to the short growing season and relative difficulty for mass cultivation, making the truffle one of the most highly prized, edible fungi 
Although truffles have been cultivated for decades, little is known of the ecology of truffle bacterial microbiome and the role it plays in the aroma 
development and spoilage during post-harvest storage The main objective of this study was to determine the effects on the truffle aroma profile 
after chilled storage for extended periods of time using solid-phase micro extraction (SPME), together with gas chromatograph mass spectrometry 
(GCMS) Black Périgord truffle samples (N=14) were provided by Australian Truffle Traders from Manjimup, Western Australia, during the truffle
