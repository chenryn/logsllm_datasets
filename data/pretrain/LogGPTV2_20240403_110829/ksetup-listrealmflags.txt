### ksetup listrealmflags

The `ksetup listrealmflags` command lists the available realm flags that can be reported by the `ksetup` utility.

#### Syntax
```
ksetup /listrealmflags
```

#### Remarks
The following table provides a detailed description of each realm flag and its corresponding value:

| Value | Realm Flag  | Description                                                                 |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0xF   | All         | All realm flags are set.                                                    |
| 0x00  | None        | No realm flags are set, and no additional features are enabled.             |
| 0x01  | sendaddress | The IP address will be included within the ticket-granting tickets.         |
| 0x02  | tcpsupported | Both the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are supported in this realm. |
| 0x04  | delegate    | Everyone in this realm is trusted for delegation.                           |
| 0x08  | ncsupported | This realm supports name canonicalization, which allows for DNS and Realm naming standards. |
| 0x80  | rc4         | This realm supports RC4 encryption to enable cross-realm trust, which allows for the use of TLS. |

#### Registry Key
The realm flags are stored in the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Domains\
```

#### Examples

- **To list the known realm flags on this computer:**
  ```
  ksetup /listrealmflags
  ```

- **To set the available realm flags that `ksetup` doesn't know:**
  You can specify the flags either by their names or by their hexadecimal values.
  
  - Using flag names:
    ```
    ksetup /setrealmflags CORP.CONTOSO.COM sendaddress tcpsupported delegate ncsupported
    ```
  
  - Using the hexadecimal value:
    ```
    ksetup /setrealmflags CORP.CONTOSO.COM 0xF
    ```

This command and its options help in configuring and managing Kerberos settings for specific realms.
