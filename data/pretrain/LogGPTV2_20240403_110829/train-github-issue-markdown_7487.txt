When element on which the tooltip is created is removed from the DOM. Html for
the corresponding tooltip is not remove from DOM and it remains on the page.
Possible solution (quick and dirty :) ) :  
I added the following code to init of the plugin and it worked for my
situation  
this.$element.on('remove', this, function (e) { e.data.hide(); })
