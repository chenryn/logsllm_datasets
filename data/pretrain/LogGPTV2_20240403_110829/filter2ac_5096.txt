**Title: Botconf2019 - Unveiling the Architecture Behind the Counter-Strike 1.6 Botnet: Zero-Days and Trojans**

The Belonard Botnet was specifically designed to promote servers in Counter-Strike 1.6. To achieve this, the botmaster utilized the Belonard Trojan, which was distributed through several channels:
- Malicious game servers
- An infected, pirated version of the Counter-Strike 1.6 client available online
- Exploits of multiple Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities within the Counter-Strike 1.6 client, including two zero-day vulnerabilities in the official Steam version.

The primary objective of the Belonard Botnet was to create a network of compromised CS 1.6 clients. Each infected machine would generate fake servers that redirected players to a malicious master server. This strategy allowed the Belonard Trojan to register a total of 1,951 fake servers, accounting for 39% of all game servers on Steam.

In our presentation, we will delve into the vulnerabilities exploited by the Belonard Trojan in the Counter-Strike 1.6 client. We will also uncover the architecture and inner workings of the botnet, and detail the process that led to its shutdown.
