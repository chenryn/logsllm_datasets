User: In virtualization technology, what are container technology and virtual machine technology? What's the difference?
Assistant: Container technology is a lightweight virtualization technology that runs applications in isolated containers at the operating system level and shares core resources with the host operating system. Each container can run its own operating system and applications, but they share the resources of the host operating system, such as the kernel, memory, and file system. Virtual machine technology is a full virtualization technology, which can package the entire operating system and applications into a virtual machine image, and then run it on the virtualization layer. Each virtual machine has its own operating system, applications, and system resources, isolated from other virtual machines. The biggest difference between the two is that virtual machine technology virtualizes by completely simulating hardware, so it requires a relatively large virtualization layer to simulate hardware, which will increase system overhead. Container technology does not need to simulate hardware, so its startup time and resource usage are much smaller than virtual machines. In addition, because containers share the resources of the host operating system, the isolation of containers is lower than that of virtual machines, and the virtualization environment between containers is relatively loose.
