### Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
**Definition:**
- **GIS (Geographic Information Systems):** A computer-based methodology for collecting, storing, manipulating, retrieving, displaying, and analyzing georeferenced data.
- **Examples:**
  - Google Earth
  - ESRI
  - Intergraph
  - GRASS

**Evolution:**
- Traditional GIS tools were primarily used for environmental issues.
- With the advent of Google Earth and Google Maps, the average internet user is now exposed to the power of mapping software.
  - **Applications:**
    - Tracking cell phones (using cell tower triangulation)
    - Tracking flights in real-time

### Geospatial Intrusion Detection Implementations
- Multiple security firms have integrated GIS tools into their products:
  - MeerCat (Secure Decisions)
  - VizCat (ETRI)
  - GeoSWAT

### Geospatial Intrusion Detection Methodology
**Goal:**
- Find a direct correlation between externally based network alerts by plotting their source locations on a geographic map.

**High-Level Process:**
1. **Plot Rolling Time Periods:**
   - Analyze data over a specified time frame (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks).
2. **Eliminate ‘Friendlies’ to Reduce IDS False Positives:**
   - **Step 2.1:**
     - Geographically plot remote branches, SOHO (Small Office/Home Office), and business partner locations by street address (highly accurate in Google Earth).
   - **Step 2.2:**
     - Create an IDS alert that triggers when a customer authenticates to a website.
3. **Run a Clustering Algorithm on Plotted Data:**
   - Available algorithms include Poisson, nearest-neighbor, Moran’s I Index, Ripley’s K Function, and Getis-Ord.
4. **Extract Network Alerts within Identified ‘Hot-Spots’:**
5. **Run a Weight Calculating Algorithm to Evaluate Relationships Between Alerts:**
   - Correlate elements such as alert severity, destination ports, and timestamps.

**Visualization:**
- **Plotting Rolling Time Series:**
  - Example: 14-day intervals (slow probe theory).
- **Map Legend:**
  - Source IDS Alert
  - Remote Offices or Telecommuting Residences
- **Potential False Positive Reduction:**
  - Depending on risk tolerance, this method can eliminate approximately 30% of false positives.

### Accuracy of IP to Latitude/Longitude Translation
**Vendors:**
- IP2Location
- MaxMind
- Quova (with wireless capabilities)

**Translation Calculation Methods:**
- Domain scraping
- Traceroute comparison
- Strategic partnerships with ISPs
- Strategic partnerships with FTP download sites

**Example of Less Accurate Translation:**

### How to Beat Geospatial Intrusion Detection
- **Loopholes in Defenses:**
  - **Sequential Scans:**
    - Most scanning and enumeration tools perform sequential scans of IP addresses. Avoid using sequential IPs for attacks.
  - **Mapping and Neighboring IPs:**
    - Map remote locations and use tools to extract neighboring IP addresses, which may be eliminated during the ‘friendlies’ filtering process.
  - **Random Geographic Locations and Varying Times:**
    - Conduct attacks from random geographic locations at different times to avoid detection.
