A. Fluid Model for Bandwidth Sharing
First, we study approximate lumping for the ODE system
˙x = f (x, α) given in (5) in Section II-B. We begin showing
that the vector ﬁeld f satisﬁes the Lipschitz continuity with
respect to the parameters α. As already pointed out, it sufﬁces
to bound the norm of the corresponding Jacobian ∂f
∂α. For this
example, it can be easily computed as
 .

The boundedness of its norm follows from the fact that any
element of the Jacobian matrix can be uniformly bounded by
exploiting Proposition 1, as this implies the boundedness of xi
solution to (5), for any 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Since the same approach
can be employed to show Lipschitz continuity also in the
upcoming examples, we omit to explicitly write the Jacobian
matrices in the following and we shall give major focus to the
ε-lumpability condition.
The lumping we consider for this example is the one
corresponding to the matrix M deﬁned in (6). As already
pointed out, if α2 (cid:54)= α3, this aggregation is not exact and
thus it induces a non-zero lumping error. Here we show that

The ﬁgure clearly shows that the minimum a-posteriori error
is attained at a value that is different than b = 0.50, which
instead minimizes the a-priori bound.
The analysis of this example allows us to provide some
more intuition regarding ε-lumpability and its relation to the
idea of heterogeneity of a ﬂuid model. In particular, we discuss
now that another aggregation matrix, M(cid:48), does not satisfy the
conditions of Theorem 4. The new aggregation we choose aims
at lumping one client type and the servers,
M(cid:48) =

By exploiting the results in Section II, we ﬁrstly note that the
performed aggregation is not exact, giving rise to a lumping
error. However, it is easy to see that no constant vector ε =
(ε1, . . . , ε4) can be found which satisﬁes condition (12).
Thus, not all kinds of heterogeneities can be neglected by
suitably perturbing the parameters of the system. However, the
underlying physical meaning of the variables might provide an
intuition as to which variables can likely be aggregated via ε-
lumpability, as the following sections show.
B. An Epidemics Model
We now turn our attention to the well known SIR
(Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model which was originally
developed in [12]. The SIR model studies the spread of
epidemics by considering the dynamics of three types of
individuals: susceptibles, who have not contracted the disease;
they may get infected by an encounter with another individual
who currently carries the disease; ﬁnally, infected individuals
recover after some time. The ODE system is:
˙S = −βSI,
˙I = +βSI − γI,
˙R = +γI,
where β and γ are positive reals describing the contact rate
and the recovery rate, respectively. The same dynamics of
interaction based on the product of two concentrations (the
mass-action law) has found applications to so-called epidemic
routing for computer networks (e.g., [33]).
Based on this model, Watson has studied a multi-class
extension where each class has a mix of susceptible, infected,
and recovered individuals regulated by the following dynam-

for every choice of a and b in (7), the triple (M, ¯M , f ), fulﬁlls
the condition (12) of ε-lumpability. This corresponds to ﬁnding
a vector of parameters ε = (ε1, . . . , ε4) which solves the
equations
min(x1 + x3, x5)α1 − (x2 + x3)(α2b + α3(1 − b)) =
min(x1 + x3, x5)(α1 + ε1)+
− (α2 + ε2)x2 − (α3 + ε3)x3
and
min(x1 + x3, x5)α1 − α4x6 =
min(x1 + x3, x5)(α1 + ε1) − (α4 + ε4)x6 .
The solution is given by
ε1 = 0,
ε2 = (1 − b)(α3 − α2),
ε3 = b(α2 − α3),
ε4 = 0.
Clearly, the solution is dependent upon the choice of ¯M,
although for this particular vector ﬁeld ε depends on b only.
In light of this, one could, in principle, minimize (cid:107)ε(cid:107) as a
means to minimizing the bound (16). Using the L2 norm
would give a strictly convex optimization problem that can be
easily solved. However, in general, the minimization of the a-
priori bound cannot be used to understand how the a-posteriori
error actually behaves with respect to the choice of the inverse
matrix.

where ti, with 1 ≤ i ≤ 100, is a sequence of equally spaced
time points in [0, 5], x(ti) and y(ti) are the numerical ODE
solutions at time ti of the original and the lumped model,
respectively. The solutions were computed with Matlab, using
the ode45 routine, which implements the well known Runge-
Kutta scheme. The parameters chosen for this experiment were
αi = 1.0 + (i − 1)/2, with initial conditions
x1(0) = 1.0,
x4(0) = 0.0,
x2(0) = 0.0,
x5(0) = 3.0,
x3(0) = 1.0,
x6(0) = 0.0.
where 1 ≤ k ≤ K, with K being the total number of classes.
Thus, the model has 3K ODEs and K(K + 1) parameters.

used in Section V for an extensive numerical experimentation
