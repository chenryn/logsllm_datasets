React version: 17.0.2
## Steps To Reproduce
  1. Make nested array element like this. All element have unique, fixed key.
    [Element0, [Element1, Element2]]
  2. Change the element array.
    [Element1, Element2]
  3. Key of element 1 and 2 aren't changed, but the elements are re-mounted.
This is not a problem if element 1 and 2 aren't in nested array.
    [Element0, Element1, Element2]
    -> [Element1, Element2]

Clone this repo, open dev tools and see console. In App.js, I made some
scenarios to test this behavior.
## The current behavior
The element with same key always unmount, if they are in nested array.
## The expected behavior
I have no idea whether this behavior is intended or kind of bug. But I
expected that element have same key in same array (also in nested array) do
not re-mount, just re-render. Please feedback if my expectation is not
correct. Thank you.
