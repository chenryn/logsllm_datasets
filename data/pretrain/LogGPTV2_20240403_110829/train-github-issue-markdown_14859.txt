### Description
The http header for the different authentication protocols is currently
hardcoded to "Authorization", which on itself is accurate according to the
standards ((ex. MDN definition)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization]). There are, however, reasons in
practice you would want to have a different, custom named header.
For example, in my case where the FastAPI is hosted behind a proxy which
already requires the Authorization header to be set. I would like it to be set
in the FastAPI to something else (e.g. like "x-bearer-key" or "foo").
Is it possible to define a custom http header name for authorization, instead
of the default "Authorization" header name?
### Wanted Solution
# example code of what would be great
auth_scheme = HTTPBearer(authorization_header='MY-OWN-KEY-INSTEAD-OF-
AUTHORIZATION')
