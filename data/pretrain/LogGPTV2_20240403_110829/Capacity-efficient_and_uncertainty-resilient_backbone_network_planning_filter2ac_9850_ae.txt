### Large-Scale Backbone Network Planning

The extensive scale of our backbone network makes it impractical to perform a global search for all possible fiber installation locations. A more practical approach is to narrow down the potential locations based on market availability and operational experience. We propose an optical topology \( G' + \Delta G' \), where \( \Delta G' \) represents the candidate fibers. These fibers are then mapped to potential IP links, forming the IP topology \( G + \Delta G \), with the potential IP links in \( \Delta G \) having zero initial capacity.

By doing so, we transform the long-term planning problem into a formulation similar to the short-term planning problem. The optimization objective remains minimizing the total cost, but now includes an additional term for fiber procurement and deployment costs. On the candidate optical topology \( \Delta G' \), \( \psi_l \) denotes the number of fibers to deploy on the fiber segment \( l \), and \( x(l) \) is the per-fiber procurement and deployment cost, as defined in Section 5.1. The fiber turn-up cost and capacity addition cost are similar to those in short-term planning, but need to be considered on the topologies \( G' + \Delta G' \) and \( G + \Delta G \) respectively, with candidate fibers and IP links.

The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{minimize} & & \sum_{l \in \Delta E'} x(l) \times \psi_l + \sum_{e \in E + \Delta E} z(e) \times \lambda_e + \sum_{l \in E' + \Delta E'} y(l) \times \phi_l \\
& \text{subject to} & & \text{SpectralConservation}(G + \Delta G, G' + \Delta G') \\
& & & \text{FlowConservation}(M, G), \quad \forall q \in QoS, \quad M \in T_q, G \in G_q + \Delta G_q \\
& & & \lambda_e \geq \Lambda_e, \quad \forall e \in E + \Delta E \\
& & & \phi_l \geq \Phi_l, \quad \forall l \in E' + \Delta E' \\
& & & \psi_l \geq 0, \quad \forall l \in \Delta E'
\end{aligned}
\]

The spectral conservation constraint and flow conservation constraint apply to the potential topologies \( G' + \Delta G' \) and \( G + \Delta G \). Although this approach results in a large number of possible IP links over the new fibers, the spectral conservation constraint ensures that only a subset of these links, whose capacity can be fully accommodated by the fibers, is selected. Similar to short-term planning, the variables \( \lambda_e \), \( \phi_l \), and \( \psi_l \) must increase relative to the base values, which are the existing capacity numbers in the current network and zero for the candidate topologies. Given that the fiber procurement and deployment cost is significantly higher than the fiber turn-up cost and capacity addition cost, our formulation naturally favors exhausting existing fiber resources first. If the optimization fails to produce feasible solutions, we expand the pool of candidate fibers and rerun the optimization.

### Evaluation

Our Hose-based capacity planning system has been in production for several years. It uses an optimization engine implemented on top of the Xpress solver [1] with a max-flow-based route simulator. This production-grade software has undergone substantial engineering efforts to scale up the optimization.

#### 6.1 Hose Conformance

**Hose Coverage of TM Sampling:**
Figure 9a shows the effectiveness of our TM sampling algorithm. The CDF distribution of planar coverage, as defined in Section 4.4, is presented for different sample sizes. With 105 TM samples, even the worst projection plane for the Hose polytope reaches over 97% coverage, and the mean coverage is over 99%. This indicates that 105 sample TMs can represent the Hose space with negligible loss of accuracy.

**Effect of Edge Threshold on Cut Generation:**
Figure 9b examines the performance of the sweeping algorithm in Section 4.2. It plots the number of generated network cuts with varying edge threshold parameter \( \alpha \). A larger \( \alpha \) results in more network cuts, and \( \alpha = 1 \) guarantees finding all cuts. In practice, \( \alpha \geq 0.095 \) is sufficient to reach the maximum number of cuts. The curve shows a sharp increase for \( \alpha \) between 0.065 and 0.07, indicating sensitivity to \( \alpha \).

**Effect of Flow Slack on DTM Selection:**
Figure 9c quantifies the relationship between the number of DTMs and the flow slack factor \( \epsilon \) in the DTM selection process (Section 4.3). A larger \( \epsilon \) qualifies more TMs as DTMs, reducing the minimum DTM count to cover all network cuts. Figure 9c shows this reduction, which is sharp initially and slows down as \( \epsilon \) increases. A smaller number of DTMs means less computation, but may compromise Hose coverage.

**Hose Coverage of DTMs:**
Figure 10 combines the above factors and shows their joint effect on DTM selection. For \( \alpha \) values of 8%, 9%, and 10%, the Hose coverage almost overlaps, suggesting \( \alpha = 8% \) is sufficient. Compared to Figure 9c, Hose coverage shows a smooth, near-linear reduction with increasing \( \epsilon \), confirming the design purpose of our DTM selection process.

**DTM Similarity:**
We also analyze the similarity of DTMs, defined as the cosine of the angle of alignment between two matrices. Figure 11 shows the mean DTM similarity with increasing \( \theta \). The mean DTM similarity remains close to 1, even for \( \theta \) in excess of 20Â°, indicating that DTMs are well-isolated in the Hose space.

#### 6.2 Performance Comparison with Pipe

**Planning Result vs. Actual Traffic:**
We evaluate the planning accuracy by comparing the planned capacity with actual traffic. Using the June 2020 network as the baseline, we perform demand forecasts for the next 6 months using both Hose and Pipe models. We replay 28 days of actual December 2020 traffic to evaluate the plans. Figure 12 compares the dropped traffic volume under steady state. The Hose model consistently shows lower daily dropped demand, with a 50% difference on 80% of the days.

**Resilience to Unplanned Failures:**
Figure 13 compares the traffic drop under 10 randomly selected fiber cuts. The Hose model consistently drops less traffic than the Pipe model, with a 50%-75% reduction in all scenarios.

**Yearly Capacity Growth:**
Figure 14a shows the yearly capacity growth for Hose and Pipe as a percentage of the baseline capacity. The Hose model achieves better capacity utilization, with a consistent reduction in required capacity.

| **Hose Coverage** | **40%** | **52%** | **58%** | **67%** | **83%** |
|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Reduced Time (mins)** | **48** | **312** | **342** | **412** | **1063** |
| **Time per DTM (mins)** | **2.28** | **4.87** | **3.84** | **2.67** | **1.69** |
| **Capacity (%)** | **8.62** | **8.28** | **10.52** | **9.31** | **8.45** |

This table summarizes the Hose coverage, reduced time, time per DTM, and capacity percentage for different Hose coverage levels.
