## Abstract
Recently, microcontrollers and FPGAs have become popular for controlling power conversion circuits due to their flexibility and ease of parameter resetting through software. However, as control circuits are placed closer to high-current main circuits, electromagnetic radiation from switching activities can cause transient faults. This study focuses on transient noise generated by a DC-DC converter and proposes a dependable digital power control circuit using an FPGA. The core idea is to schedule sampling times away from switching times to mitigate the effects of transient noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations.

## 1. Introduction
Energy efficiency and ecological concerns have gained global attention. Efficient power conversion, such as in DC-DC and AC-DC converters, is crucial for energy savings and miniaturization of electronic devices. Traditionally, analog control components like operational amplifiers were commonly used in these circuits. However, with the advent of digital control circuits, which offer higher flexibility and configurability, they have become more favorable. Several studies have shown significant progress in this area [1].

As power converter circuits become smaller and more integrated, control circuits and gate drivers are placed closer to high-current main circuits. This proximity leads to electromagnetic radiation, which can cause transient faults in the control and neighboring circuits [2]. Digital control circuits, particularly those based on microcontrollers and FPGAs, are more susceptible to noise because their operations rely on sampled values.

In this research, we focus on transient noise caused by switching activities in a DC-DC converter and propose a dependable digital power control circuit using an FPGA. The fault model is based on fault-injection experiments conducted in our previous work [3]. We propose a fault-tolerant method and present its implementation and evaluation through the design of a digital power control circuit and spice simulations.

## 2. Fault Model
We target a buck DC-DC converter, widely used in various electronic devices. Our goal is to propose a dependable digital power control circuit for this converter. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the buck DC-DC converter.

In switching devices, parasitic LC resonance is the primary source of noise during switching activities. When the switch is turned on or off, the energy stored in the parasitic LC components causes resonant noise. This high-frequency noise, which can be either radiative or conductive, is likely to propagate to the input line of the error amplifier, as shown in Figure 1. In this study, we assume that the sampling frequency is equivalent to the switching frequency, resulting in one sampling point per switching cycle.

## 3. Transient-Fault Tolerant Method
Our proposed method leverages the predictable timing of noise, as the current cycle's switching timing is determined in the previous cycle by the controller. We adaptively adjust the sampling times to avoid the pulse overshoots and undershoots.

The sampling time is chosen based on the duty cycle. If the duty cycle is over 50%, the sampling time is taken just before the pulse undershoot to avoid overshoot noise (Figure 3). Conversely, if the duty cycle is under 50%, the sampling point is taken just before the pulse overshoot to avoid undershoot noise (Figure 4).

This method avoids noise that lasts less than 50% of the switching cycle. Although the sampling interval is not constant, the circuit can still function correctly and avoid absolute malfunctions.

## 4. Evaluation and Future Work
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through circuit design and spice simulations. Figure 6 shows the voltage output of the DC-DC converter with the implemented fault-tolerant method, indicating successful noise avoidance.

Future work includes implementing the proposed method on an FPGA for a DC-DC converter and evaluating it in a real-world environment. Additionally, we plan to extend this method to a DC-AC converter.
