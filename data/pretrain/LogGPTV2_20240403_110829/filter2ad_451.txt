Abstract—Recently, a microcomputer and a FPGA are apt
to be used for control of the power conversion circuits because
of their capability to simplify the parameter resetting and also
their ﬂexibility on the basis of programming by software. On the
other hand, the control circuits are getting extremely close to the
high current main circuit. Thus the electro-magnetic radiation
generated nearby the high current pulse may affect the control
circuit as transient faults. In this study, we focus on transient
noise caused by switching activities of a DC-DC converter and
propose a dependable digital power control circuit by FPGA. The
basic idea is to keep the sampling times as far away from the
switching times as possible to avoid the effects of transient noise.
A control circuit, with the proposed method applied, is designed
and its effectiveness is shown by simulations.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Recently, energy saving and ecological issues have catched
attentions from people around the globe. Of all others, efﬁcient
transformation of the switch mode power supply such as DC-
DC converter, AC-DC converter and so on are playing one
of the crucial rolls for energy saving and miniaturization of
electronic devices. Conventionally, usage of analog control
parts in the control circuit of a converter such as operating
ampliﬁers is very common. However, with high ﬂexibility and
parameters’ conﬁgurability, digital control circuit has become
more favorable and several researches are showing signiﬁcant
progresses [1].
On the other hand, while the power converter circuits get
smaller and highly integrated, control circuits and gate driver
circuits are getting extremely close to the high current main
circuit. Thus the electromagnetic radiation generated nearby
the high current pulse may affect the control circuit and the
neighboring circuits as transient faults [2]. Above all, digital
control circuits are more vulnerable to noise than analog con-
trol circuits. This is because all operations in microcomputers
and FPGAs are based on sample values.
In this research, we focus on transient noise caused by
switching activities of a DC-DC converter and propose a
dependable digital power control circuit by FPGA. The fault
model is based on the fault-injection experiments on a FPGA
board, which is conducted in our previous research [3]. Ac-
cordingly, a fault-tolerant method is proposed regarding the
fault model. Furthermore, the implementation and evaluations

of the proposed method are presented by designing the digital
power control circuit and executing spice simulations.
II. FAULT MODEL
As a ﬁrst step of our study, we target on a buck DC-DC
converter which is broadly used in various electronic devices.
Speciﬁcally, we aim to propose a dependable digital power
control circuit on a FPGA for the converter. A block ﬁgure of
the buck DC-DC converter is shown on Fig.1.
Fig. 1: DC-DC converter.
In the switching device, the existence of the parasitic LC
resonance is the main cause for noise to be generated during
switching activities. During the switching activity, speciﬁ-
cally at the point where the switch is turned on/off, noise
is generated by the resonance phenomenon with the energy
stored in the components of the parasitic LC. The resonant
current will continue with a constant period of time and an
attenuation behavior as shown on Fig.2. This high frequency
noise can either be radiative noise or conductive noise and from
our previous research [3]. We can assume that it will likely
propagate to the input line of the error ampliﬁer as shown
on Fig.1. Furthermore, In this research, we suppose that the
sampling frequency is basically equivalent to the switching
frequency. Hence, there will be one sampling point in each
switching cycle.

5.5v when samplings times are taken at the 50th, 51st, 52nd,
53rd, and the 54th clock after the pulse overshoot. Therefore,
there were noise affection at the sampling times.

conventional digital power control when noises are input.
The simulation of the DC-DC converter with the proposed
dependable digital power control circuit is shown on Fig.6. The
output voltage is correctly converged to the expected voltage
5v indicating the success noise avoidance of the control circuit.

III. TRANSIENT-FAULT TOLERANT METHOD
In our proposed method, we utilize the fact that the occur-
rence timing of the noise is acquirable since the current cycle’s
switching timing is decided at the previous switching cycle by
the controller of the converter. We then adaptively tune the
sampling times to avoid the noise at the pulse overshoots and
undershoots.
The sampling time is chosen base on the duty cycles. When
the duty cycle is over 50%, the sampling time will be taken just
before the pulse undershoot to avoid overshoot noise as shown
on Fig.3. Conversely, when the duty cycle is under 50%, the
sampling point will be taken just before the pulse overshoot
to avoid undershoot noise as shown on Fig.4.
Fig. 3: Sampling time when duty cycle is over 50%.
Fig. 4: Sampling time when duty cycle is lower than 50%.
By implementing this method, we can at least avoid noise
affection that has a duration less than 50% of the switching
cycle. On the other hand, because the sampling interval is
not constant, the controller might get effected by errors of
sampling values. However, the circuit can deﬁnitely escape
from the absolute malfunction state.
IV. EVALUATION AND FUTURE WORK
Let us show the effects of out scheme by the circuit design
and spice simulations.

power control and fault-tolerant method implemented when
noises are input.
Our future work include implementation of the proposed
method on the FPGA of the digital power control on a DC-
DC converter and its evaluations at the actual environment. In
addition, implementation of the proposed method on a DC-AC
converter is also one of our next goal.
