I encountered an issue while attempting to upload to Google App Engine, as the `appcfg` tool returned the following error message:

"This application does not exist (app_id=u'xxx')."

Initially, I was only a developer on the App Engine project, so for testing purposes, I created a new App Engine application where I was the owner. However, I continued to receive the same error message even with the newly created App Engine.

To resolve this issue, I edited the `app.yaml` file to ensure it contained the correct application name. Specifically, in the `app.yaml` file, under the line `application: [insert app name here]`, I updated the `[insert app name here]` placeholder with the correct application name. I suspect that the incorrect name may have been a result of previous modifications made while addressing a different bug.

To determine the proper application name, I referred to my applications listed in the Google App Engine (GAE) admin console. This allowed me to identify and use the correct name, which resolved the issue.

I hope this solution helps others who encounter the same problem.
