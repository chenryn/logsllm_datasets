In order to have nice looking paths without hash or bang, I am using history
mode:
var router = new VueRouter({  
routes: routes,  
mode: 'history'  
})
However, when I refresh a page, I get a 404 error. If I remove mode:
'history', I can go directly to urls at a path and refresh pages in my
browser.
Can I remove hash and bang (#!) from my urls and be able to refresh pages and
use direct urls to a path?
