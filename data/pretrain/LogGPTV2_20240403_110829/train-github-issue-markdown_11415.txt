@tvyomkesh opened some issues (#9384, #9389) on errors in the examples (and
some PRs to fix this). This raised the following question to me:
Apart from fixing the examples, I think we should think for a moment what we
want to do with these examples. Why do we want them? What is their function?  
And depending on that, do we want to update/extend them? Or maybe move them to
the docs?
I personally never looked at these examples. And they are also quite outdated.
Eg using the ols from pandas is somewhat (unofficially) deprecated for the use
of statsmodels, and the finance module in matplotlib is deprecated starting
from matplotlib 1.4. And to get such data, I think pandas-datareader should be
used.
