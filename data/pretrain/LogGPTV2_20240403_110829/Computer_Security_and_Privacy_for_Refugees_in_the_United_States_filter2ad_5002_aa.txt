Abstract—In this work, we consider the computer security
and privacy practices and needs of recently resettled refugees
in the United States. We ask: How do refugees use and rely on
technology as they settle in the US? What computer security and
privacy practices do they have, and what barriers do they face
that may put them at risk? And how are their computer security
mental models and practices shaped by the advice they receive?
We study these questions through in-depth qualitative interviews
with case managers and teachers who work with refugees at
a local NGO, as well as through focus groups with refugees
themselves. We ﬁnd that refugees must rely heavily on technology
(e.g., email) as they attempt to establish their lives and ﬁnd jobs;
that they also rely heavily on their case managers and teachers
for help with those technologies; and that these pressures can
push security practices into the background or make common
security “best practices” infeasible. At the same time, we identify
fundamental challenges to computer security and privacy for
refugees, including barriers due to limited technical expertise,
language skills, and cultural knowledge — for example, we ﬁnd
that scams as a threat are a new concept for many of the
refugees we studied, and that many common security practices
(e.g., password creation techniques and security questions) rely
on US cultural knowledge. From these and other ﬁndings, we
distill recommendations for the computer security community
to better serve the computer security and privacy needs and
constraints of refugees, a potentially vulnerable population that
has not been previously studied in this context.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recent years have seen a number of crises around the world
in which individuals ﬂee their home countries in the hopes of
ultimately resettling somewhere else. As of 2016, there were
22.5 million refugees worldwide, and 84,995 were resettled
to the US in 2016 alone [1], [2]. Prior work suggests that
technologies play a critical role in the lives of these refugees
in refugee camps, in transit, and once resettled (e.g., [3]–[8]).
Our research is driven by the following questions: To what
degree must refugees, once resettled, depend on technology in
their efforts to integrate into their new societies and reestablish
their lives? On which technologies do refugees depend, and
how could they be harmed if they are unable to adequately
secure their digital footprint? What computer security and
privacy practices do refugees have, and what barriers do they
face that prevent them from implementing stronger security
and privacy practices? And, perhaps most importantly, what
could be done to empower refugees with greater capabilities
to protect their computer security and privacy?
We hypothesize that refugees — a vulnerable population
according to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) [2] — may be different from other user
populations in terms of their interactions with technology
and their computer security needs and practices. Refugees,
by deﬁnition, are ﬂeeing from real threats, and hence might
have unique perspectives on threats and adversaries. Further,
there might be a range of cultural, linguistic, and technological
challenges that refugees must overcome in order to sufﬁciently
protect their computer security and privacy.
Thus, in this work we study the computer security and
privacy needs, practices, and challenges among refugees —
speciﬁcally, refugees from East Africa and the Middle East
who resettle to the United States. While we believe that the
inquiry into this population and our results are of scientiﬁc
interest, we also believe that our work can provide a foun-
dation for helping refugees have a secure and private digital
presence.
Methodology Overview. Refugees around the world are a
large and heterogeneous population. We study speciﬁcally
Middle Eastern and East African refugees in the United
States — allowing us to both focus our efforts and dive deeply
into the concerns of these populations, while still considering
refugees from a variety of backgrounds. We conducted semi-
structured qualitative interviews and focus groups to broadly
explore the computer security and privacy challenges, needs,
and opportunities for this population. As is common for
formative studies of this type [9], [10], we focused in-depth
on a small number of participants.
Through initial contact with an NGO committed to assisting
refugees and immigrants, we learned that arriving refugees
are assigned case managers (who help their assigned refugees
ﬁnd jobs and otherwise matriculate into society) and English
teachers. Both case managers and teachers play a central role
in the lives of refugees, and they often introduce refugees to
or help them with technologies necessary for their lives in the
US (e.g., setting up an email account to communicate with
potential employers). Similar to other work studying reset-
tled refugees [11], [12], we conducted interviews with case
managers and teachers because of the broad perspective they
have across the many refugees they work with, and because
refugees themselves are a potentially vulnerable population.

We interviewed four teachers and ﬁve case managers, four of
whom were refugees themselves.
We then used the results of the interviews with case
managers and teachers to help guide our direct interactions
with refugees, which complemented and corroborated the
interviews with case managers and teachers. At the suggestion
of a case manager, rather than interview refugees individually,
we conducted several small focus groups, where each focus
group had participants who ﬂed from the same country (Syria
or Somalia), and the discussions largely took place through
an interpreter. Our use of focus groups, rather than one-on-
one interviews, enabled free-ﬂowing conversations with the
refugees, and in less intimidating settings than one-on-one
interviews. In total, we conducted three focus groups, one with
four Syrian refugees and two with ﬁve Somali refugees each.
Foundations for Refugee Computer Security. Our interview
and focus group results shed light on the computer security and
privacy needs of the refugee population we study, as well as
the unique barriers they face to protecting their digital security
and privacy. Example themes that emerged include:
it
• Consistent with our hypotheses, we ﬁnd that refugees
today are highly dependent on technology in order to
establish themselves in the US. However, we did not
anticipate just how dependent on technologies they are.
Whether to apply for jobs, or to ﬁnd housing,
is
impossible for them to escape the need to use technology.
This reliance on technology makes computer security
both critical as well as (in some cases) in tension with
other, primary goals (such as ﬁnding a job).
• When refugees enter the US, they must learn not only
how to use technology, but must also overcome language
and cultural barriers. Critically, we ﬁnd that many com-
puter security and privacy related practices include deeply
embedded US or Western cultural knowledge and norms,
including the use of birth dates as authenticators and
common techniques for creating memorable passwords.
Indeed, the very notion of a scam seems foreign to some
refugees.
• We know, from our preliminary conversations with a local
NGO focused on refugee and immigrant support, that
case managers play a central role in helping refugees
establish themselves in the US. However, we did not
anticipate the extent to which refugees must trust their
case managers, even when in some cases they do not
want to trust them. The computer security practices of
refugees are thus intimately tied to the security practices
of their case managers, and their relationships with them.
From these and other ﬁndings, we make concrete recom-
mendations to bridge gaps we observe in how refugees are
able to protect their digital security and privacy — for example,
to support more secure use of public computers or account
management solutions that explicitly support access by trusted
parties like case managers.
Ultimately, by providing a broad basis for understand-
ing how recently resettled Middle Eastern and East African
410
refugees in the US interact with technology, our work provides
a foundation for future, deep-dive investigations into speciﬁc
technical needs, which may also apply more broadly to other
groups sharing some of the same characteristics.
II. BACKGROUND ON REFUGEES
The processes surrounding how people become, and how
countries accept, refugees are complicated. We provide essen-
tial background about refugees and the refugee process here,
focused on — given the scope of our study — refugees who
resettle in the US.
Deﬁnition of a Refugee. Refugees are people who have left
their home country due to a “well-founded fear of being per-
secuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership
of a particular social group or political opinion” [13]. In 2016,
there were an estimated 22.5 million refugees worldwide, and
an additional 2.8 million asylum-seekers (people who want
refugee status but have not received it yet) [1].
Resettlement Process. Before arriving in the US, refugees
must pass extensive background checks and interviews.
Refugees will, in many cases, have also spent years in in-
termediate countries or refugee camps before arriving in the
US [2]. Before resettling, refugees attend a cultural orientation,
which provides a breadth of information about the US.
Aid after Resettlement, Case Managers, and Teachers. The
US State Department assigns each refugee to one of nine
national resettlement agencies [2]. To assist in their transition,
refugees are also paired with local NGOs, like the one we
recruited from. The NGO we recruited from, and others, as-
signs refugees case managers and offers English classes. Case
managers refer to their assigned refugees as clients, a term that
we will also use interchangeably. Case managers, who may be
refugees themselves, can have diverse responsibilities, but in
general those responsibilities include helping their assigned
refugees (clients) ﬁnd jobs and otherwise matriculate into the
US [14]. Case managers typically speak their clients’ native
language. The English classes are taught by English as a
Second Language (ESL) teachers and are intended to help
refugees communicate in their new environment.
III. MOTIVATION AND RESEARCH GOALS
There is a growing body of work considering diverse
populations in computer security literature, with recent studies
focused on speciﬁc potentially vulnerable user groups, in-
cluding low-income people in the US [15], domestic abuse
victims [16], [17], and journalists [18]. Refugees are a popu-
lation with unique backgrounds (e.g., ﬂeeing threats in other
countries) and constraints (e.g., at
lack of
familiarity with the English language, and highly dependent
on the US government and NGOs for support).

Our ultimate goal is to help refugees protect themselves
from computer security and privacy threats. To address this
goal, however, we cannot blindly set out to design and build se-
curity tools, or develop security education campaigns, intended

for refugees. First, we must deeply understand the world in
which resettled refugees operate, and how they interface with
technology. We use interviews and focus groups to form this
deep foundation (Section IV).
For our interviews and focus groups, we do not want to
presuppose that refugees should use technology, or, if they
use technologies, that the so-called security best practices for
most users are the optimal security best practices for refugees.
This perspective — both valuing security, but not wanting to
assume that our views of security will match the views
of refugees — guides us to formulate the following speciﬁc
research questions for our interviews and focus groups:
1) How do refugees use technology as they settle in the
US, if at all, and how might their relationships and life
goals inﬂuence that use?
2) What barriers inhibit the implementation of strong se-
curity and privacy practices among refugees?
3) What computer
security and privacy practices do
refugees have?
4) What do refugees learn (e.g., from case managers and
teachers) about computer security and privacy?
These research questions are intentionally broad and ex-
ploratory, enabling us to step back, ask, and answer higher-
level questions, such as: Are refugees exposing themselves
to unnecessary computer security and privacy risks? If they
are, is it due to a lack of awareness, a language barrier, a
lack of education, or something else? Is conventional wisdom
about computer security best practices sufﬁcient to enable
secure practices for refugees, or are unique solutions needed?
And, if there are any shortcomings, what could be done by
the computer security and privacy community to empower
refugees with greater computer security and privacy?
IV. METHODOLOGY
We use semi-structured interviews with case managers and
teachers and focus groups with refugees to answer the research
questions outlined in Section III. We conducted interviews
and focus groups between May and September of 2017.
All our activities were approved by our institution’s IRB,
and we discuss human subjects ethics further below. Table I
summarizes our participants.
Semi-structured interviews with case managers and teach-
ers. We conducted semi-structured interviews with four ESL
teachers (T1-4) and ﬁve case managers (CM1-5) from a local
NGO that provides support to refugees and immigrants. Each
411
interview was conducted by two interviewers, and all but
one of the interviews were audio recorded and transcribed
