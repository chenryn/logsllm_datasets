**ATT&CK ID:** M1051  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Update Software

To effectively manage and mitigate security risks, a comprehensive patch management process should be implemented. This process should include the following steps:

1. **Identify and Evaluate Dependencies:**
   - Regularly review and check for unused, unmaintained, or previously vulnerable dependencies.
   
2. **Remove Unnecessary Components:**
   - Eliminate unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation that are no longer needed or pose potential security risks.

By implementing these practices, organizations can ensure that their software remains up-to-date and secure, reducing the risk of exploitation through known vulnerabilities.
