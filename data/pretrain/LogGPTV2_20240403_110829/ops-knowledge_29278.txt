User: My goal is to be able to start shell script in separate process and inspect it by linux ptrace syscall.
The problem is that I need to get process PID before it even starts. Stuff like subprocess.Popen(['ls', '-l']) or python-sh runs command immediately, so in a time I am trying to inspect this process by its PID it is likely finished.
On the other hand I cant use os.fork + exec because bash command I start overrides python code.
Assistant: If you're using Unix, I think that you can use the preexec_fn argument in the Popen constructor.
According to the documentation of subprocess: 

If preexec_fn is set to a callable object, this object will be called in the child process just before the child is executed. (Unix only)

As it runs in the child process, you can use os.getpid() to get the child pid.
