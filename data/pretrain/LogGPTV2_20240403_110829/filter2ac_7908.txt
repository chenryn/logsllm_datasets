#### Recommendations for SID-History Management and SID Filtering

1. **Clean Up SID-History Attributes**:
   - After completing legitimate account migrations, ensure that the `SID-History` attributes are cleaned up. This step helps to prevent potential misuse of old SIDs.

2. **Apply SID Filtering to Interforest Trusts**:
   - Consider implementing SID Filtering on interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude `SID-History` from requests to access domain resources.
   - **Purpose**: SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain. This prevents the trusted domain from falsely claiming that a user has membership in groups outside of the domain.

3. **Default and Custom Configurations**:
   - **Forest Trusts**: SID Filtering is enabled by default for forest trusts. However, it may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts.
   - **External Trusts**: SID Filtering is automatically enabled on all external trusts created using domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 or later.

4. **Legacy Trusts and Deliberate Disabling**:
   - Note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts. Additionally, it may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources.

5. **Applying SID Filtering**:
   - **Disabling SIDHistory on Forest Trusts**:
     - Use the `netdom` tool with the following command:
       ```sh
       netdom trust /domain:<trusted_domain> /EnableSIDHistory:no
       ```
     - Execute this command on the domain controller.
   - **Applying SID Filter Quarantining to External Trusts**:
     - Use the `netdom` tool with the following command:
       ```sh
       netdom trust /domain:<trusted_domain> /quarantine:yes
       ```
     - Execute this command on the domain controller.

6. **SID Filtering in Single Forests**:
   - Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended. This is an unsupported configuration and can lead to breaking changes.
   - **Best Practice**: If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy, it should be removed from the forest. In such cases, split the trusted and untrusted domains into separate forests, and then apply SID Filtering to the interforest trust.

By following these recommendations, you can enhance the security of your Active Directory environment and mitigate potential risks associated with SID-History and trust relationships.
