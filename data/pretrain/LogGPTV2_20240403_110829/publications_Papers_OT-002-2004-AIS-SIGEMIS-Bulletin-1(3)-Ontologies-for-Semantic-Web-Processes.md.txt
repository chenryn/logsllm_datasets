Introduction
The emergence of e-commerce has changed the foundations of business, forcing
managers to rethink their strategies. Organizations are increasingly faced with the
challenge of managing e-business systems, e-commerce applications, Web services,
Web processes, and workflows.
Web services and Web processes promise to ease several of nowadays
infrastructure challenges, such as data, application, and process integration. With the
emergence of Web services, workflow management system become essential to
support, manage, and enact semantic Web processes, both between enterprises and
within the enterprise (Sheth, Aalst, & Arpinar, 1999).
There is a growing consensus that Web services alone will not be sufficient to
developed valuable and sophisticated Web processes due the degree of heterogeneity,
autonomy, and distribution of the Web. Several researchers agree that it is essential
for Web services to be machine understandable in order to allow the full deployment
of efficient solutions supporting all the phases of the lifecycle of Web processes.
The idea and vision of the “Semantic Web” (Berners-Lee, Hendler, & Lassila,
2001) catches on and researchers as well as companies have already realized the
benefits of this great vision. Ontologies (Uschold & Gruninger, 1996) are considered
the basic building block of the semantic Web as they allow machine supported data
interpretation reducing human involvement in data and process integration. For the
tourism industry, the development of ontologies is fundamental to allow machine
supported travel related data interpretation and integration.
Our research is dedicated to help the travel industry to take full advantage of the
near universal access to the Internet. One of the fastest-growing categories of products
in the travel industry is the creation of dynamic vacation travel packages. The
objective of dynamic packaging is to pack all the components chosen by a traveler to
create one reservation. Regardless of where the inventory originates, the package that
is created is handled seamlessly as one transaction, and requires only one payment
from the consumer.
This can be accomplished in an efficient, interoperable, and scalable manner
through the development of a commonly accepted communication technology using
Web services, Web processes and semantics. Semantics and ontologies provide an
agreed understanding of data between and among travelers and travel-related
businesses. Ontologies encourage the development of interoperable systems that can
help create and support new collections of travel services to better meet the demands
and expectations of travelers and the travel industry.

Travel Industry Trends
The travel industry, due to the long-distance interactions it requires, was one of the
earliest electronic commerce adopters (Sabre (SABRE, 2004) system start operating
in 1959). This industry is one of the most important kind of commerce through the
Web, representing almost 40% of all global electronic commerce (Filho & Ramos,
2003) and one that most reflects the impact that this technology can have in the
business process itself (Carroll, 2002).
With the Internet dissemination and the e-commerce growth there is a shift from the
traditional off-line distribution process based on operators catalogs to an on-line
promotion and reservation process. A shift that is marked by isolated initiatives
guided by the B2C (business-to-customer) promise of increased profit margins and
reduced commission values. This lead us to the present situation where we can find a
diverse and numerous group of on-line reservation systems, most of them focused in
one or in a few types of products without an integrated view of vacation planning, that
is what the consumer looks for.
For this reason, the most recent trend for the travel industry is based on dynamic
packaging. Dynamic packaging improves packaging revenues and packaging margins
per transaction while offering travelers new opportunities to save by booking flights,
hotels or rental cars together in a single transaction.
Research Objectives
Currently, the travel industry has concentrated their efforts on developing open
specifications messages, based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), to ensure
that messages can flow between industry segments as easily as within. For example,
the OpenTravel Alliance (OTA, 2004) is an organization pioneering the development
and use of specifications that support e-business among all segments of the travel
industry. The cumulative effort of various teams, individuals, associations,
companies, and international organizations, including air, car, cruise, rail, hotel, travel
agencies, tour operators and technology providers, has produced a fairly complete set
of XML-based specifications for the travel industry (more than 140 XML
specification files exist).
The Web has permanently changed the manner vacation packages can be created.
Consumers can now acquire packages from a diversity of Web sites including online
agencies and airlines. With the spread of Web travel, a new technology has surfaced
for the leisure travel industry: dynamic packaging. For the development of dynamic
packaging solutions it is necessary to look in detailed at the technology components
needed to enhance the online vacation planning experience. By transitioning from a
third-party service in most markets, dynamic packaging engines can better tailor its
package offerings, pricing and merchandising to consumer demand.
Our research objective is to help the travel industry to take full advantage of the
latest Internet technologies, such as Web services, Web processes, and semantics to
develop dynamic packaging solutions. Semantics allow rich descriptions of Web
services and Web processes that can be used by computers for automatic processing
in various tourism related applications. The deployment of ontologies help articulate a
well-defined set of common data elements or vocabulary that can support
communication across multiple channels, expedite the flow of information, and meet
travel industry and customer needs.

Semantic Web services will allow the automatic discovery, composition,
integration, orchestration, and execution of inter-organization business logic, making
the Internet become a global common platform where organizations and individuals
communicate among each other to carry out various commercial activities and to
provide value-added services. In the context of tourism, there is a great interest of
such powerful capabilities. Major airlines, hoteliers, car rental companies, leisure
suppliers, travel agencies and others are interested in creating and implementing
industry-wide, open e-business specifications, tools and Web processes involving
Web services.
Practical Results
Results from our research will lead to the spearhead and foster the cross-industry
consensus needed to establish and maintain the most effective and widely used
specifications designed to electronically exchange business data and information
among all sectors of the travel industry using ontologies.
The development of a suitable ontology for the tourism industry will serve as a
common language for travel-related terminology and a mechanism for promoting the
seamless exchange of information across all travel industry segments. The current
development of open specifications messages based on XML, such as OTA schema,
to ensure the interoperability between trading partners and working groups is not
sufficiently expressive to guaranty an automatic exchange and processing of
information.
The major result of our research will be the development of a comprehensive and
precise reference ontology named COTRIN (Comprehensive Ontology for the Travel
Industry). Major airlines, hoteliers, car rental companies, leisure suppliers, travel
agencies and others can use it to bring together autonomous and heterogeneous Web
services, Web processes, applications, data, and components residing in distributed
environments. The objective of COTRIN is to be deep and complex, implementing
rich semantic interrelationships between the nodes of its taxonomies retrieved from
the data and terminology presents in the XML-based OTA specifications (Figure 1).
COTRIN will be developed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL, 2004)
designed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

With COTRIN, semantic Web processes, managing dynamic package determine
which Web services are used, what combinations of Web services are allowed or
required and specific rules determine how the final retail price is computed (Cardoso,
Miller, Sheth, Arnold, & Kochut, 2004).
This work represents what can be achieved by the symbiotic synthesis of two of the
hottest R&D and technology application areas: Web services and the semantic Web,
as recognized at the Twelfth International World Wide Conference (2003) and in the
industry press. The intelligent combination of Web services and the semantic Web
can start off a technological revolution with the development of semantic Web
processes (Cardoso & Sheth, 2003). These technological advances can ultimately lead
to a new breed of Web-based applications.
Impact on the Portuguese Tourism Industry
Our research as a direct impact on the Portuguese tourism industry, as well as the
worldwide tourism industry. Portugal is well known for its tourism. In fact, in 2002
alone, this market has generated a revenue of more than $7200 millions (INE, 2004).
The deployment of ontologies, Web services, and Web processes for the tourism
industry will enable the construction of sophisticated infrastructures to support e-
commerce and e-business activities. These ontologies encourage the development of
interoperable systems that can help create and support new collections of travel Web
services to better meet the demands and expectations of travelers through dynamic
packaging.
The main sectors of the industry affected include airlines, car rental agencies, hotel
corporations, leisure suppliers, tour operators, railways, ferry operators, cruise
operators and any other area of travel and tourism.
Conclusions
New trends in the travel industry require the ability to dynamically compose travel
packages from the aggregation and orchestration of distributed Web services. With
the growth of demand for customized travel itineraries, agencies seek technology that
provides their clients the flexibility to build unique packages from a selection of
choices. Dynamic packages can be created and booked effortlessly with private and
published air, car hire, hotels, attractions and insurance rates.
Current approaches, using XML-based specification messages, are not sufficient to
enable the creation of dynamic travel packages. One solution is the use of ontologies
to overcome semantic problems that arise from the autonomy, heterogeneity, and
distribution of Web services. Our research targets the development of a
comprehensive and functional ontology, named COTRIN, relating the terms
commonly used by the tourism industry when exchanging data and information to
deploy and manage Web processes to dynamically compose travel packages.
