User: When I try to use the Google Speech Rec API I get this error message. Any help?

dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/Cellar/flac/1.3.1/lib/libFLAC.8.dylib
  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/speech_recognition/flac-mac
   Reason: image not found

I'm using PyCharm.
I have tried copy pasting and uninstalling and reinstalling but to no avail. HELP :) My whole project is to get the user to say something, and have google translate translate it and have it say the answer. I have the translating and speaking covered, but the Speech Recognition is what I am having trouble with now. Thanks in advance
