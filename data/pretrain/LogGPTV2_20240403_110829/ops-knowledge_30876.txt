When attempting to use the Google Speech Recognition API, I encountered the following error message and am seeking assistance:

```
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/Cellar/flac/1.3.1/lib/libFLAC.8.dylib
  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/speech_recognition/flac-mac
   Reason: image not found
```

I am using PyCharm as my development environment. I have tried copying and pasting the library, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling it, but the issue persists.

My project's goal is to capture a user's spoken input, translate it using Google Translate, and then have the system read out the translated text. While I have successfully implemented the translation and text-to-speech components, I am currently facing difficulties with the speech recognition part. 

Here are additional error messages that I received:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

    return pa.read_stream(self._stream, num_frames)
IOError: [Errno Input overflowed] -9981
```

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

**Update:** I have since resolved the issue. It turned out that I had forgotten to install Homebrew, which was necessary for the missing FLAC library.
