To search for a package or theme in the settings tab, follow these steps:

1. Enter your search query in the search bar.
2. If you are looking for a package, first click on the "Themes" button, and then click on the "Packages" button. This will prompt Atom to search for a package that matches your search query.

This process ensures that Atom accurately locates the package or theme you are seeking.
