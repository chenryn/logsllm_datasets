User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Does "late launch"/"dynamic chain of trust" allow remote attestation? One of the features support by modern processes and Trusted Platform Modules is "dynamic chain of trust" (also known under the acronym DRTM, for dynamic root of trust measurement).  This allows loading a critical piece of software in an isolated execution environment, where it can be protected from the rest of the software on the system.

The feature is initiated via the SENTER instruction (on Intel chips) or SKINIT instruction (on AMD).  On Intel, this is part of Intel's Trusted Execution Technology (TXT).  I've sometimes heard this technology under the name "late launch": e.g., if you want to start a hypervisor or other critical software while the system is already running, in a trusted way, you do a "late launch" of the hypervisor/software module.

DRTM/"late launch" provides isolation (so that other software components cannot tamper with the code or data of the trusted module that is launched in this way).  It also provides sealed storage, so that the trusted module can store data in encrypted form, where the decryption key will be released to future invocations of the trusted module but not to any other software component.

Does "dynamic chain of trust" support remote attestation?  Does it provide way to attest to the code of the trusted module that was launched in this way, to a third party?

When a dynamic launch is used on an area of memory, specific PCR indexes in the TPM are used to used to record the state of that software. If these PCR indexes are included in the attestation request by the challenger, then that software would be attested to in the response. These PCR indexes are 17-22, as specified in the TCG's PCClient inplementation for BIOS spec, see page 30.

Intel's implementation of TXT support on Linux, tboot, has missed a detail, which they will hopefully fix soon. tboot doesn't expose the event log, which would show what software was extended into TPM PCRs as part of the TXT launch. This is a requirement for a remote challeneger to attest against dynamic launch PCRs, so at the moment, support isn't fully there. You can technically find the event log, but its not available in a TCG standard format, so all the common trusted computing tools that'd be used to parse it will not work ATM.
