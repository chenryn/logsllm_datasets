User: So, it turned out i was missing a semi-colon from my PYTHONPATH definition. But this only got me so far. for some reason, my script did NOT work as a scheduled task (on WinXP) until I explicitly added a directory from PYTHONPATH to the top of my script.
Question is:
When do I need to explicitly append something to my path and when can I simply rely on the environment variables?
Assistant: If the other modules belongs to the same package you should be responsible to locate them if 
they are not stored in the conventional format (i.e. append the path with sys).
If the other modules are user-configurable then the user have to specify the installation
path trough PYTHONPATH
