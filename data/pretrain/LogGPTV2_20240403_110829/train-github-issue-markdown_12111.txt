### Minimum Working Example (MWE) in Julia

Below is a minimum working example (MWE) demonstrating the use of broadcasting with `LinearAlgebra.I` in Julia. The code also includes the output of `versioninfo()` to provide context about the environment.

```julia
# Define a 2x2 matrix
julia> x = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2
 3  4

# Load the LinearAlgebra package
julia> using LinearAlgebra

# Subtract the identity matrix from x using broadcasting
julia> x .-= LinearAlgebra.I
┌ Warning: broadcast will default to iterating over its arguments in the future. Wrap arguments of
│ type `x::UniformScaling{Bool}` with `Ref(x)` to ensure they broadcast as "scalar" elements.
│   caller = ip:0x0
└ @ Core :-1
2×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 0  1
 2  3

# Correct usage by wrapping LinearAlgebra.I with Ref
julia> x .-= Ref(LinearAlgebra.I)
2×2 Array{Int64,2}:
 -1  0
  1  2

```

In this example, the `LinearAlgebra.I` represents the identity matrix. When subtracting it from `x` using broadcasting, a warning is issued. The correct approach is to wrap `LinearAlgebra.I` with `Ref` to ensure it broadcasts as a scalar element.
