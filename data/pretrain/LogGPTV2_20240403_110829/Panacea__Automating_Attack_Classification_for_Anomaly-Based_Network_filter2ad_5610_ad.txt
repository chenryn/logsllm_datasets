**Event Occurrence and Classification Confidence**

In our benchmarks, a common occurrence is the system incorrectly classifying an attack, often after other actions taken by the attacker. Both Support Vector Machines (SVM) and RIPPER can generate a classification confidence value for each attack, which can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the classification. The confidence value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with lower values indicating a higher likelihood of misclassification (see Table 8 for average confidence values for DSC).

**Utilizing Confidence Values for Misclassification Detection**

The confidence value can be used to detect possible misclassifications. Users can set a minimum confidence threshold (e.g., 0.5). Any alert with a confidence value below this threshold is forwarded to a human operator for manual classification. This additional check increases the percentage of total attacks correctly classified to 95% for SVM and 94% for RIPPER when using the standard training set without additional training samples (Table 8).

**Table 8: Effects of Confidence Evaluation for DSC**

| Metric | SVM | RIPPER |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Average Confidence Value for Correctly Classified Attacks | 0.75 | 0.62 |
| Average Confidence Value for Misclassified Attacks | 0.37 | 0.43 |
| Percentage of Total Attacks Correctly Classified Without Confidence Evaluation | 92.0% | 89.0% |
| Percentage of Total Attacks Correctly Classified With Confidence Evaluation | 95.0% | 94.0% |
| Number of Alerts Forwarded for Manual Classification | 10/100 | 13/100 |
| Number of Forwarded Attacks That Were Actually Wrongly Classified | 3/10 | 5/13 |
| Number of Forwarded Attacks That Were Actually Correctly Classified | 7/10 | 8/13 |

**User Actions with and Without Panacea**

Table 9 outlines the actions users must take with or without Panacea for alert classification across different datasets.

**Table 9: User Actions for Alert Classification**

| Dataset | Without Panacea | With Panacea |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| DSA     | Classify any alert | No action to take |
| DSB     | Classify any alert | Classify alerts used during training |
| DSC     | Classify any alert | No action to take (alerts have been previously classified) |

**Usability in Panacea**

Panacea not only provides automatic attack classification for Anomaly-Based Systems (ABS) but also enhances usability. In automatic mode, Panacea achieves accurate classification (over 75% of correctly classified attacks). In semi-automatic and manual modes, users provide limited input (i.e., a class label). Panacea automates the extraction of relevant information and the update of the classification model, tasks that are typically error-prone and time-consuming when done manually.

**Related Work**

Despite the well-known issue of lack of attack classification in anomaly-based intrusion detection, limited research has been conducted on this topic. Robertson et al. [2] suggest using heuristics to infer the class of web-based attacks, but this approach requires users to generate and maintain heuristics, which is time-consuming. Wang and Stolfo [12] use Z-Strings for distributing attack payloads among IDSs, but this method is not systematic and requires manual classification for unmatched attacks. Panacea, in contrast, applies a systematic classification using binary-based n-gram analysis and can use alerts from both signature-based and anomaly-based systems.

**Conclusion**

Panacea is a system that automatically and systematically classifies attacks detected by a payload-based ABS. It extracts information from alerts during a training phase and predicts the attack class for new alerts. The alerts used for training can be generated by either a signature-based or an anomaly-based system. In the former case, no manual intervention is required, as Panacea automatically extracts the attack class. In the latter case, the user provides the attack class for each alert used in training.

Panacea improves usability and integrates anomaly-based and signature-based IDSs. Benchmarks show that Panacea effectively classifies attacks, even those not previously detected. Future work includes using a cascade of SVM and RIPPER to further increase overall accuracy.
