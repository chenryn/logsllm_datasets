User: I have jython jar and Pig installed on the server. Have Pig jars as well.
Can someone help me out with the proper steps to bundle them so that I can use my Python UDFs ?
Thanks
Assistant: From my short experience in Pig there are two ways of doing this: you can either place the jar in your Pig's lib folder, somewhere about /usr/share/pig/lib/, or register the jar using its specific location from grunt (Pig shell), using:
REGISTER /path/to/your/jar/jython.jar;
Once available, register your UDF from grunt using:
REGISTER '/path/to/your/udf/udf.py' USING jython as py_udf;
And you can use it like this: py_udf.my_method(*)
my_method being the name of the python method you created.
