User: How to list all subdirectories sorted by file size by recursive command line?
Assistant: One possible approach is to use the following command to recursively list all subdirectories and use the "du" command to calculate the total file size of each subdirectory: ``` find . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 du -h - s | sort -hr ``` Explanation: - `find . -type d -print0`: List all directories in the current directory, and use NULL characters as separators. - `xargs -0`: Read directory names from standard input and pass them to the next command (the "du" command in this case), using the NULL character as a delimiter. - `du -h -s`: Calculate the total size of all files in each directory and output it in a human-readable format (with the "-h" option). Here, the "-s" option means to show only the total size, not the details of each file. - `sort -hr`: Sort files in reverse order by size (use '-r' option) and use human-readable format (use '-h' option) for sorting.
