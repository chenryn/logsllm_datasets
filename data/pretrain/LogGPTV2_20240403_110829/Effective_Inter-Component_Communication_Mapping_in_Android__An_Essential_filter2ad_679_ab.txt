### Component Matching Process in Banking Applications

Let us consider the example in Figure 3, which is part of our banking application. The `startActivity(i)` instruction serves as an exit point for the application. Our analysis provides the value of `i` at this instruction and all possible targets. These targets can be components within our banking application or components from previously analyzed applications.

Figure 4 provides an overview of our component matching process, which can be divided into three main functions:
1. **Identifying Entry Points**: Finding target components that can be started by other components (entry points) and defining criteria for a target to be activated.
2. **Characterizing Exit Points**: Determining the characteristics of exit points, i.e., what kind of targets can be activated at these program points.
3. **Matching Exit Points with Possible Targets**: Matching exit points with potential entry points.

#### Detailed Analysis Steps

Given an application, we start by parsing its manifest file to extract package information, permissions used, and a list of components and associated intent filters (Step 1). These components are potential targets for Inter-Component Communication (ICC). We match these possible entry points with the pool of already computed exit points (Step 2). The newly computed entry points are then added to our database of entry points (Step 3). This database, along with the exit points database, grows as we analyze more applications.

Next, we perform string analysis to identify key API method arguments such as action strings or component names (Step 4). The main Interprocedural Distributive Environment (IDE) analysis then precisely computes the values of Intents used at ICC API calls (Step 5). This analysis also computes the values of Intent Filters that select Intents received by dynamically registered Broadcast Receivers. These exit points are matched with entry points from the existing pool of entry points (Step 6). The newly computed exit points are stored in the exit point database for later matching (Step 7). The values associated with dynamically registered Broadcast Receivers are used for matching with exit points in the database (Step 8). Finally, these values are stored in the entry point database (Step 9).

#### Input and Bytecode Conversion

One of the inputs to our analysis is a set of class files in Java bytecode format. Our analysis is built on top of Soot [34], an existing Java analysis framework. Android application code is distributed in a platform-specific Dalvik bytecode format, optimized for resource-constrained devices like smartphones and tablets. Therefore, we use Dare [29], an existing tool that efficiently and accurately retargets Dalvik bytecode to Java bytecode. While other tools such as dex2jar and ded are available, Dare is currently the only formally defined one, and the output of other tools is sometimes unreliable.

#### Manifest Parsing and Matching

The manifest parsing step is straightforward, and we use a simple string analysis (see Section 6). The matching process involves matching exit points with entry points, which can be made efficient if properly organized in a database. Thus, we focus our description on the main IDE analysis.

It is important to distinguish between what is computed by the string analysis and the IDE analysis. In the example from Figure 2, the string analysis computes the values of the arguments to the API calls `setAction()` and `addCategory()`. The IDE analysis, on the other hand, uses the results from the string analysis along with a model of the Android ICC API to determine the value of the Intent. Specifically, in Figure 2, it determines that, at the call to `startActivity()`, the Intent has action `a.b.ACTION` and category `a.b.CATEGORY`. In Figure 3, the IDE analysis tells us that `i` has two possible values at the call to `startActivity()` and determines exactly what those two possible values are.

#### Advantages of the IDE Framework

Reducing the Intent ICC problem to an IDE problem [32] offers significant advantages. Our analysis is scalable (see Section 6) and precise, generating few false positives (links between two components that may not communicate in reality). Security analyses using our ICC analysis will not be plagued by ICC-related false positives. This precision is due to the fact that the IDE framework is flow-sensitive, inter-procedural, and context-sensitive. Flow-sensitivity allows us to distinguish Intent values between different program points. Context-sensitivity means that the analysis of a method call is sensitive to the calling context, ensuring that the return value is precise and not influenced by irrelevant contexts.

#### Supergraphs and Environment Transformers

A program is represented using a supergraph \( G^* \), composed of the control flow graphs of the procedures in the program. Each procedure call site is represented by two nodes: a call node representing control right before the callee is entered and a return-site node to which control flows right after exiting the callee. Figure 5 shows the supergraph of the program in Figure 3.

The nodes of a supergraph are program statements, and there are four kinds of edges between these nodes:
- A call edge between the call node and the first statement of the callee.
- A return edge between the last statement of the callee and the return-site node.
- A call-to-return edge between the call node and the return-site node.
- Normal intraprocedural flow edges.

Environment transformers are functions that modify the environment according to the semantics of each program idiom. Let \( D \) be a finite set of symbols (e.g., program variables), and let \( L = (V, \sqcup) \) be a join semilattice with bottom element \( \bot \). An environment \( e \) is a function from \( D \) to \( L \). The set of environments from \( D \) to \( L \) is denoted by \( \text{Env}(D, L) \).

The operator \( \sqcup \) is defined over \( \text{Env}(D, L) \) as a natural extension of \( \sqcup \) in semilattice \( L \). An environment transformer \( t \) is a function from \( \text{Env}(D, L) \) to \( \text{Env}(D, L) \). The algorithms from [32] require that environment transformers be distributive. An environment transformer \( t \) is said to be distributive if for all \( e_1, e_2, \ldots \in \text{Env}(D, L) \), and \( d \in D \), \( (t(\bigsqcup_i e_i))(d) = (\bigsqcup_i t(e_i))(d) \).

An instance of an IDE problem is defined as a tuple \( (G^*, D, L, M) \), where:
- \( G^* = (N^*, E^*) \) is the supergraph of the application being studied.
- \( D \) is the set of symbols of interest.
- \( L \) is a join semilattice with least element \( \bot \).
- \( M \) assigns distributive environment transformers to the edges of \( G^* \).
