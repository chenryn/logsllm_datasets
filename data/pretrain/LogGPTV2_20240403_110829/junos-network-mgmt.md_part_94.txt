1. Enable configuration of the VLAN bridge-domain-name to which you want to apply a Layer 2 port-
mirroring firewall filter for forwarded or flooded traffic:
• For a VLAN:
[edit]
user@host# edit bridge-domains bridge-domain-name
• For a VLAN under a routing instance:
[edit]
user@host# edit routing-instances routing-instance-name bridge-domains bridge-domain-name
user@host# set instance-type virtual-switch
For more detailed configuration information, see Configuring a VPLS Routing Instance.
2. Configure the VLAN:
[edit]
user@host# set domain-type bridge
user@host# set interface interface-name
user@host# set routing-interface routing-interface-name
For more detailed configuration information, see Configuring a Bridge Domain and Configuring VLAN
Identifiers for Bridge Domains and VPLS Routing Instances.

3. Enable configuration of traffic forwarding on the VLAN:
[edit ... bridge-domains bridge-domain-name]
user@host# edit forwarding-options
4. Apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the VLAN forwarding table or flood table.
• To mirror packets being forwarded to the VLAN:
[edit ... bridge-domains bridge-domain-name forwarding-options]
user@host# set filter input pm-filter-for-bd-ingress-forwarded
• To mirror packets being flooded to the VLAN:
[edit ... bridge-domains bridge-domain-name forwarding-options]
user@host# set flood input pm-filter-for-bd-ingress-flooded
5. Verify the minimum configuration for applying a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the
forwarding table or flood table of the VLAN.
a. Navigate to the hierarchy level at which the VLAN is configured:
• [edit]
• [edit routing-instances routing-instance-name]
b. Display the VLAN configurations:
user@host# show vlans
vlans {
vlan-name {
instance-type virtual-switch; # For a bridge domain under a routing instance.
domain-type bridge;
interface interface-name;
forwarding-options {
filter { # Mirror ingress forwarded traffic
input pm-filter-for-bd-ingress-forwarded;
}
flood { # Mirror ingress flooded traffic
input pm-filter-for-bd-ingress-flooded;
}
1176
}
}
}
Example: Layer 2 Port Mirroring at a Logical Interface
The following steps describe an example in which the global port-mirroring instance and a port-
mirroring firewall filter are used to configure Layer 2 port mirroring for the input to a logical interface.
1. Configure the VLAN example-bd-with-analyzer, which contains the external packet analyzer, and the
VLAN example-bd-with-traffic, which contains the source and destination of the Layer 2 traffic being
mirrored:
[edit]
bridge-domains {
example-bd-with-analyzer { # Contains an external traffic analyzer
vlan-id 1000;
interface ge-2/0/0.0; # External analyzer
}
example-bd-with-traffic { # Contains traffic input and output interfaces
vlan-id 1000;
interface ge-2/0/6.0; # Traffic input port
interface ge-3/0/1.2; # Traffic output port
}
}
Assume that logical interface ge-2/0/0.0 is associated with an external traffic analyzer that is to
receive port-mirrored packets. Assume that logical interfaces ge-2/0/6.0 and ge-3/0/1.2 will be
traffic input and output ports, respectively.
2. Configure Layer 2 port-mirroring for the global instance, with the port-mirroring destination being
the VLAN interface associated with the external analyzer (logical interface ge-2/0/0.0 on VLAN
example-bd-with-analyzer). Be sure to enable the option that allows filters to be applied to this port-
mirroring destination:
[edit]
forwarding-options {
port-mirroring {
input {
rate 10;
run-length 5;
}
1177
family ethernet-switching {
output {
interface ge-2/0/0.0; # Mirror packets to the external analyzer
no-filter-check; # Allow filters on the mirror destination interface
}
}
}
}
The input statement at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring] hierarchy level specifies that
sampling begins every tenth packet and that each of the first five packets selected are to be mirrored.
The output statement at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring family ethernet-switching] hierarchy
level specifies the output mirror interface for Layer 2 packets in a bridging environment:
• Logical interface ge-2/0/0.0, which is associated with the external packet analyzer, is configured
as the port-mirroring destination.
• The optional no-filter-check statement allows filters to be configured on this destination interface.
3. Configure the Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter example-bridge-pm-filter:
[edit]
firewall {
family ethernet-switching {
filter example-bridge-pm-filter {
term example-filter-terms {
then {
accept;
port-mirror;
}
}
}
}
}
When this firewall filter is applied to the input or output of a logical interface for traffic in a bridging
environment, Layer 2 port mirroring is performed according to the input packet-sampling properties
and mirror destination properties configured for the Layer 2 port mirroring global instance. Because
this firewall filter is configured with the single, default filter action accept, all packets selected by the
input properties (rate = 10 and run-length = 5) match this filter.
1178
4. Configure the logical interfaces:
[edit]
interfaces {
ge-2/0/0 { # Define the interface to the external analyzer
encapsulation ethernet-bridge;
unit 0 {
family ethernet-switching;
}
}
ge-2/0/6 { # Define the traffic input port
flexible-vlan-tagging;
encapsulation extended-vlan-bridge;
unit 0 {
vlan-id 100;
family ethernet-switching {
filter {
input example-bridge-pm-filter; # Apply the port-mirroring firewall filter
}
}
}
}
ge-3/0/1 { # Define the traffic output port
flexible-vlan-tagging;
encapsulation extended-vlan-bridge;
unit 2 {
vlan-tags outer 10 inner 20;
family ethernet-switching;
}
}
}
Packets received at logical interface ge-2/0/6.0 on VLAN example-bd-with-traffic are evaluated by
the port-mirroring firewall filter example-bridge-pm-filter. The firewall filter acts on the input traffic
according to the filter actions configured in the firewall filter itself plus the input packet-sampling
properties and mirror destination properties configured in the global port-mirroring instance:
• All packets received at ge-2/0/6.0 are forwarded to their (assumed) normal destination at logical
interface ge-3/0/1.2.
• For every ten input packets, copies of the first five packets in that selection are forwarded to the
external analyzer at logical interface ge-0/0/0.0 in the other VLAN, example-bd-with-analyzer.
1179
If you configure the port-mirroring firewall filter example-bridge-pm-filter to take the discard action
instead of the accept action, all original packets are discarded while copies of the packets selected
using the global port-mirroring input properties are sent to the external analyzer.

The following example is not a complete configuration, but shows all the steps needed to configure port
mirroring on an L2VPN using family ccc.
1. Configure the VLAN port-mirror-bd, which contains the external packet analyzer:
[edit]
vlans {
port-mirror-vlan { # Contains an external traffic analyzer
interface ge-2/2/9.0; # External analyzer
}
}
2. Configure the Layer 2 VPN CCC to connect logical interface ge-2/0/1.0 and logical interface
ge-2/0/1.1:
[edit]
protocols {
mpls {
interface all;
}
connections {
interface-switch if_switch {
interface ge-2/0/1.0;
interface ge-2/0/1.1;
}
}
}
3. Configure Layer 2 port mirroring for the global instance, with the port-mirroring destination being
the VLAN interface associated with the external analyzer (logical interface ge-2/2/9.0 on VLAN

port-mirroring {
1180
input {
rate 1;
maximum-packet-length 200;
}
family ccc {
output {
interface ge-2/2/9.0; # Mirror packets to the external analyzer
}
}
instance {
inst1 {
input {
rate 1;
maximum-packet-length 300;
}
family ccc {
output {
interface ge-2/2/9.0;
}
{
}
}
}
}
4. Define the Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter pm_filter_ccc for family ccc:
[edit]
firewall {
family ccc {
filter pm_filter_ccc {
term pm {
then port-mirror;
}
}
}
}
1181
5. Apply the port mirror instance to the chassis:
[edit]
chassis {
fpc 2 {
port-mirror-instance inst1;
}
}
6. Configure interface ge-2/2/9 for the VLANs, and configure interface ge-2/0/1 for port mirroring with
the pm_filter_ccc firewall filter:
[edit]
interfaces {
ge-2/2/9 {
encapsulation ethernet-bridge;
unit 0 {
family ethernet-switching;
}
}
ge-2/0/1 {
vlan-tagging;
encapsulation extended-vlan-ccc;
unit 0 {
vlan-id 10;
family ccc {
filter {
input pm_filter_ccc;
}
}
}
unit 1 {
vlan-id 20;
family ccc {
filter {
output pm_filter_ccc;
}
}
}
1182
}
}

mirroring on an L2VPN using family ccc and aggregated Ethernet links.
1. Configure the VLAN port_mirror_bd, which contains the external packet analyzer:
[edit]
vlans {
port_mirror_vlan { # Contains an external traffic analyzer
interface ge-2/2/8.0; # External analyzer
}
}
2. Configure the Layer 2 VPN CCC to connect interface ae0.0 and interface ae0.1:
