User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to reference a Domain Controller out of the Local Network? We have multiple servers scattered over different hosting providers. For learning, experimenting and, ultimately, production purposes, I set one of them as a Domain Controller. 

That went well, most of our services are now authenticating via AD, which helps us a lot.

What I want to do now is to simplify the authentication for the multiple servers, by making each of them look at the Domain Controller. This way, our Devs can log into (Remote Desktop) the multiple servers with the same credentials from AD.

I know I have to configure each server to look at the Domain Controller. 

But when I try to add the Domain Controller to the Computer, it cannot find it, although the Domain Controller address is a valid, reachable internet sub-domain (as in "ad.ourcompany.com"). 




  This is the detailed error message:
  
  Note: This information is intended for a network administrator.  If
  you are not your network's administrator, notify the administrator
  that you received this information, which has been recorded in the
  file C:\Windows\debug\dcdiag.txt.
  
  The following error occurred when DNS was queried for the service
  location (SRV) resource record used to locate an Active Directory
  Domain Controller for domain ad.ourcompany.com:
  
  The error was: "DNS name does not exist." (error code 0x0000232B
  RCODE_NAME_ERROR)
  
  The query was for the SRV record for
  _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.ad.ourcompany.com
  
  Common causes of this error include the following:
  
  
  The DNS SRV records required to locate a AD DC for the domain are not registered in DNS. These records are registered with a DNS server
  automatically when a AD DC is added to a domain. They are updated by
  the AD DC at set intervals. This computer is configured to use DNS
  servers with the following IP addresses:
  
  109.188.207.9
  
  109.188.207.10
  One or more of the following zones do not include delegation to its child zone:
  
  ad.ourcompany.com
  
  ourcompany.com com
  
  . (the root zone)

What am I missing?

I'm an experienced Dev, but a newbie Sysdamin experimenting with new stuff. 

Disclaimer

All IP addresses and domains/subdomains were changed to preserve security. If by any chance you still can see private information, please let me know so that I can change it.

Assistant: For the love of God, don't have Domain Controllers that are accessible over the internet.  That's begging for a catastrophe.  You need to set up site-to-site VPNs between your sites, and make sure your subnet/subdomain on which AD is located is NOT accessible other the internet through anything but a VPN.

In IPv4, that means your Domain Controllers, (and your whole internal network as well) should have a privately routed address such as 10.x.x.x 192.168.x.x or 172.16-31.x.x, and not start with a publicly routed octet like 109.

DO NOT just go punching holes in your firewalls to make this work, please.
