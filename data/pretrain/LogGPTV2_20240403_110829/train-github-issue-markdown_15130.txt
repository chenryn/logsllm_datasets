Yesterday, while working on buffer geometry manipulation, I discovered a useful utility function: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16824650/#answer-54496265). 

Would it be beneficial to include this function in the `BufferGeometryUtils` library? Or is there already a more convenient method for flipping `BufferGeometries` available?
