## Abstract
Monitoring unused or dark IP addresses can significantly enhance the detection of network abuse activities without many of the challenges associated with traditional intrusion detection and firewall systems. This paper addresses the design and deployment of a system for monitoring large, unused address spaces, such as class A networks with 16 million IP addresses. We introduce the Internet Sink (iSink) system, which efficiently, extensibly, and scalably measures packet traffic on these unused IP addresses. Unlike conventional intrusion detection systems or firewalls, iSink includes an active component that generates response packets to incoming traffic, enabling it to distinguish between different types of attacks by examining the response payloads. The key feature of iSink’s design is its stateless active response component, which ensures high scalability. We present performance results from both controlled laboratory experiments and a live deployment case study, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of our implementation and the unique insights into abuse activity it provides.

## 1. Introduction
Network abuse, including intrusions by port scanning and self-propagating worms, remains a significant and ongoing threat in the Internet. New scanning methods are continually being developed to evade detection by standard firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Research by Staniford et al. [27] and Moore et al. [18] highlights the magnitude of the threat posed by new classes of worms and the difficulty of containing them, presenting serious challenges to the research and operational communities.

Improving the measurement and detection capabilities is crucial for protecting networks from malicious intrusions. One effective method is to monitor both used and unused address space in a given network. Monitoring unused addresses, which are often dropped by a network’s gateway or border router, offers two key advantages. First, packets destined for unused addresses are almost always malicious, minimizing false positives—a significant problem in NIDS. Second, a detection tool monitoring unused addresses can actively respond to connection requests, capturing data packets with attack-specific information. This approach is particularly valuable in class A and class B networks, where the number of unused addresses is substantial.

Several projects, including the DOMINO project [31], the Honeynet project [29], LaBrea tarpits [14], and backscatter analysis by Moore et al. [19], have adopted the idea of monitoring unused address space.

This paper makes two contributions:
1. **System Architecture and Implementation:** We describe the architecture and implementation of the Internet Sink (iSink), a system designed for both active and passive monitoring of abuse traffic. The key design requirements of iSink are extensibility and scalability, allowing it to monitor large IP address spaces.
2. **Performance and Evaluation:** We provide a case study and performance evaluation of our iSink implementation, demonstrating its capabilities and the unique insights it provides into abuse activity.

## 2. Related Work
The concept of monitoring unused IP addresses for intrusion detection has been explored in various forms. Terms like "Internet Sink-holes" [8], "Blackhole Routers" [9], and "Network Telescopes" [15] have been used to describe these monitors. Traditional honeypots, defined as systems with no authorized activity, are deployed to monitor intrusions. Honeynets, which are networks of honeypots, often face management and scalability challenges [29]. Moore [15] discusses the challenges of deploying honeypots in a class A network telescope.

Systems similar to our Active Sink include Honeyd [10] and LaBrea Tarpit [14]. While Honeyd simulates virtual honeypots with diverse interactive response capabilities, its stateful design limits scalability. LaBrea, designed to slow worm propagation, lacks the rich interaction needed to gather detailed response information. Our Active Sink, based on the Click modular router platform [12], is stateless and highly scalable, making it suitable for monitoring large IP address ranges.

Empirical studies, such as those by [33] and [19], provide global perspectives on intrusion and attack activity, motivating and informing our work. Intrusion detection systems (NIDS) typically operate on active IP addresses and must distinguish nefarious traffic from legitimate traffic. High-performance packet monitors, such as [4, 7, 11], scale to log packets on high-speed links but do not actively respond to incoming traffic. Our iSink complements NIDS by providing both passive and active monitoring capabilities.

## 3. Internet Sink Architecture

### 3.1 Design Requirements
The general requirements for an iSink system are:
- **Scalability:** Both passive and active monitoring capabilities must be scalable.
- **Security:** The system must be secure.
- **Passive Monitoring:** Accurate capture of packet header and payload information.
- **Active Response:** Generation of appropriate response packets at transport and application levels to gather detailed information on abuse activity.
- **Statelessness:** Minimal state maintenance in active responders to ensure high scalability.
- **Sampling Techniques:** Use of sampling to increase scalability without substantially altering measurement results.
- **Open Platform:** Open-source foundational components.

### 3.2 Active Response: Design Space
We explore the architectural alternatives for sink-hole response systems, comparing LaBrea, Honeyd, Honeynets, and our Active Sink based on the following characteristics:

| System | Configurability | Modularity | Flexibility | Interactivity | Scalability |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Active Sink | High | High | High | High | High |
| Honeyd | High | High | Medium | High | Low-Medium |
| Honeynet | Low | Low-Medium | Low-Medium | Medium | Low-Medium |
| LaBrea | Low | Low-Medium | Low-Medium | Low | High |

- **Configurability:** Ability to define the layout and components of response networks. Active Sink uses a BPF-like language for fine-grained and coarse-grained control.
- **Flexibility:** Ability to mix and match services with operating systems. Active Sink and Honeyd offer high flexibility.
- **Modularity:** Ability to compose and layer services. Active Sink’s modular design facilitates service composition.
- **Interactivity:** Scope of response capability. Active Sink and Honeyd have comparable interactivity.
- **Scalability:** Number of connections handled in a given time period. Active Sink’s stateless design provides high scalability.

### 3.3 Implementation
Our monitoring infrastructure includes:
- **Passive Monitor:** Based on Argus, a generic libpcap-based IP network auditing tool.
- **Active Sink:** Built using Click, a modular router platform. It includes elements like Poll Device, IP Classifier, and various responders (e.g., Windows Responder, HTTP Responder).
- **NAT Filter:** Routes requests to appropriate responders and filters known vulnerabilities.
- **VMware Honeynets:** Commodity operating systems running on VMware.
- **NIDS:** Used to evaluate packet logs and implement real-time filtering decisions.

### 3.4 Deployment: Campus-Enterprise Sink
The campus iSink monitors approximately 100,000 unused IPv4 addresses within 4 sparsely-to-moderately utilized class-B networks. A “black-hole” intra-campus router advertises the class B aggregate /16 routes, ensuring unsolicited traffic is routed to the iSink. This setup also allows the iSink to detect routing failures passively.

### 3.5 Deployment: Service-Provider Sink
The service-provider iSink monitors 16 million IPv4 addresses in one class A network. An ISP router, located at our campus’ service provider, serves as the gateway. The service provider advertises the class A network via BGP, and SNMP-based measurements are used to compute packet loss.

## 4. Experiences with Internet Sink
### Investigating Unique Periodic Probes
The periodicity observed in the service-provider iSink data is an excellent example of the unique perspective on intrusion traffic provided by iSink. Our analysis revealed that most of the periodicity was due to specific services. For instance, we identified strong evidence of periodic probing in our class A monitor, which we attributed to the LovGate worm [2]. Additionally, we uncovered an SMTP hotspot within the class A network, which was traced to misconfigured wireless routers from a major vendor.

These results demonstrate that our iSink architecture supports a range of capabilities while providing scalable performance. The use of Active iSinks extends basic intrusion monitoring capabilities in individual networks or in the Internet as a whole.
