# How It Works (V)
- **Restores Original Code & State**: The system restores the original code and state.
- **Continues Execution as If Nothing Happened**: The execution continues as if no interruption occurred.
- **Except You Got Pwned**: However, the system has been compromised.

## What Your Mother Warned You About
- **Hackers Are Sneaky**: Hackers are adept at hiding their activities.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Modern hackers don't just use simple tools like LRK4 and BNC; they employ more sophisticated methods.
- **Creativity and Skill**: Good hackers, much like high-quality penetration testers, display creativity and advanced skills.

## Automated Debugging
- **Human Capabilities**: A human with a debugger can perform complex and stealthy actions.
- **Automation Goals**: We aim to automate these capabilities.
- **GDB and GDB/MI**: GDB is a powerful debugger, and GDB/MI (Machine Interface) is its programmatic interface.
- **Python + GDB**: Python, combined with GDB, is an effective mix for scripting and automation due to its ubiquity and interactive shell.

### Automated Debugging (II)
- **Objective**: Achieve the sneakiness of a human with the speed and portability of a script.
- **Approach**: This involves less traditional debugging (no symbol information) and more binary analysis and virus techniques.

## Details
- **SSH-Jack Nitty Gritty**:
  - **Python GDB/MI**: Using Python to interact with GDB/MI.
  - **Finding a Safe Place**: Identifying a safe point in the program to stop and inject code.
  - **Redirecting Execution**: Deciding where to redirect the execution flow.
  - **Generating and Injecting Code**: Creating and injecting malicious code.
  - **Running the Code**: Executing the injected code.

- **General Techniques**: These techniques are discussed with reference to SSH-Jack but are generally applicable.

### GDB/MI
- **GDB Overview**: GDB is the GNU debugger.
- **GDB/MI**: GDB/MI is the machine interface for GDB.
- **gdbmi.py**: A Python interface to GDB, providing basic functionality.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  g = gdbmi()
  g.connect(pid)
  g.insertBreak(breakpoint)
  g.waitForBreak()
  oldeip = g.getRegs()["eip"]
  g.setByte(0x0ee7beef, 0x29)
  ```

### A Safe Place
- **Single-Threaded and Global Variables**: Care must be taken due to single-threaded nature and use of global variables.
- **Identifying a Safe Point**:
  - Read the source code.
  - Choose a location close to normal execution, such as the mainline.
- **Stopping and Locating**:
  - Stop the process.
  - Locate the address of the safe place.
  - Add a breakpoint and continue execution.

### Finding `select()`
- **No Debug Symbols**: Without debug symbols, additional steps are required.
- **Locating `select()`**:
  - `select()` is provided by libc.
  - Use the dynamic linker to find the address of `libc::select()`.
  - Find the entry in the ELF Global Offset Table (GOT) for `libc::select()`.
  - Find entries in the ELF Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) for the GOT entry.
  - Find calls to the PLT entry in the code.
  - In this case, a breakpoint in the ELF PLT is sufficient.

### Where We'll Do the Evil
- **Virtual Channel Setup Code**:
  - Located in `ssh.c`, specifically `ssh_session2_open()`.
  - No debug symbols, but a unique string "dup() in/out/err failed" is present.
  - Find the unique string in the ELF `.rodata` section and its reference in the `.text` section.

### The Evil Itself
- **Overwriting Function Code**:
  - Replace the first half of the virtual channel setup code.
  - Save and restore registers and flags.
  - Use "shellcode" for `socket()` and `connect()`.
  - Insert a socket where SSH expects a local file handle.
  - Ensure the register state and stack remain unchanged.
  - Use libc calls instead of syscalls.

### Generating the Evil
- **Working Backwards**:
  - Start from the unique string.
  - Learn the stack size.
  - Patch in command-line parameters.
  - Patch stack size and PLT entries for `socket()` and `connect()` into the code.

### Injecting the Evil
- **Backup and Overwrite**:
  - Backup EIP.
  - Backup old code.
  - Inject evil code that saves and restores registers/flags.
  - Overwrite the start of the function with the evil code.
  - Set a breakpoint to catch the end of the evil code.

### Running It
- **Execution and Cleanup**:
  - Save EIP.
  - Save the code to be overwritten.
  - Inject the evil code.
  - Clear and set new breakpoints.
  - Continue execution.
  - Restore the old code and clear breakpoints.
  - Detach from the process and send a SIGWINCH to wake it up.

### SCP & Remote Commands
- **Client-Side Checks**:
  - Differentiate between channel requests (CMSG_EXEC_CMD vs CMSG_EXEC_SHELL).
  - Parse `argv` to determine the remote command.
  - Patch the global buffer command.
- **Server-Side Issues**:
  - No TTY issued.
  - No `select()` busting SIGWINCH.
  - Install a custom SIGWINCH handler.

### Jack Yourself?
- **Testing the Attack**:
  - Write hijack code in C and compile it into the application.
  - Hook it up to a secret keystroke or signal.
  - Base the 'shellcode' on the compiled output.
- **Debugging with Symbols**:
  - Implement hijacking for a binary with debug symbols.
  - Build a list of necessary symbols and write code to find them.
  - Test on friends and package with a GUI for ease of use.

### Bits and Pieces
- **Considerations**:
  - Think about SCP backups, CVS, and rsync.
  - Check if the jacked connection appears in the list.
  - Determine what happens when the user logs out.

### Compatibility
- **Requirements**:
  - Recent Python (>=2.2).
  - IA32-specific.
  - Should work on OpenSSH 3.x.
  - Known to work on Debian Sarge, RHEL3, RH9, Slackware 9.1.
  - SuSE's GCC may cause issues.

### Anti-Forensic Technique
- **Principles**:
  - No code on disk: avoid tripwire and EnCase.
  - Use local tools and interpreters.
  - Reuse existing connections.
  - Encrypt everything to render packet logs useless.

### Implementation
- **Good Practices**:
  - Use general-purpose tools like Python and GDB.
  - Leverage SSH encryption.
- **Improvements Needed**:
  - Avoid leaving Python code on disk.
  - Encrypt new connections.
  - Use SSH port forwarding for encrypted sessions.

### Loading Python Directly into Memory
- **Process**:
  - Compile Python bytecode locally, compress, and base64 encode.
  - Generate a stub to unpack and run the code.
  - Send both across the shell.
  - Run a Python interpreter to execute the code.

### MAFL-Load
- **Script for Ease**:
  - `mafl-load script.py [args]`: Automates the process.
  - Use Screen for even more convenience.

### Improvements and Future Directions
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Runtime assembler with Mosdef.
  - Pure Python debugger.
  - Cross-architecture support.
  - Apply to other protocols like MSRDP and Citrix ICA.
  - Develop a programmatic debugging toolkit.

### Is This Theo de Raadt's Fault?
- **Not Theo's Fault**:
  - SSH protocol allows multiple shells.
  - Server-to-client shells and unsolicited port-forwarding are restricted.
  - Other SSH implementations may differ.

### Mitigation Techniques
- **Prevent Rooting**:
  - Restrict `ptrace()` to root.
  - Setgid your SSH client.
  - Restrict SSH trusts.
  - Treat raw sockets with caution.

### Why You Should(n't) Care
- **Awareness**:
  - Understand the risks of being rooted.
  - Rich desktops make attacking admins a viable route.
  - Protocols with virtual channel architecture are particularly vulnerable.
