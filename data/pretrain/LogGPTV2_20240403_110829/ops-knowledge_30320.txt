User:  You need to log in to a Linux server remotely. If you cannot connect directly to the terminal, please provide a solution for remote login.
Assistant: You can remotely log in to a Linux server using the SSH protocol. The following are the steps of remote login: 1. Confirm the IP address and SSH port number of the server. 2. Open an SSH client on the local terminal, such as PuTTY or SecureCRT. 3. Enter the server's IP address and SSH port number in the SSH client. 4. Enter your username and password to authenticate. 5. After the connection is successful, you will enter the terminal interface of the server, where you can execute commands and operate the server. Note: Make sure you have obtained login credentials for the server to avoid unauthorized access. Also, for security, it is recommended to use SSH keys for authentication.
