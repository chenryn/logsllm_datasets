### Description
Passing content in a slot causes the component to re-render when the parent
re-renders, even if the component's data hasn't changed.
### Steps to reproduce
  1. Create a simple component that shows the amount of times it's been rendered:
        Vue.component('times-rendered', {
        created() {
          this.timesRendered = 0
        },
        render(h) {        
          return h('div', `Times rendered: ${++this.timesRendered}`)
        }
    });
  2. Use this component twice. Once with content in the default slot, once without. After the component is mounted, trigger any update to its data:
          {{ updateTrigger }}
            Any content in the default slot causes a re-render. Why?
### What is expected?
I would expect each instance of the component to only render once.
### What is actually happening?
The component with content in the slot renders twice.

I'm not actually sure whether this is a bug or a feature request. Maybe this
is expected behavior currently. If it is, then I guess this would be better
classified as a feature request.
