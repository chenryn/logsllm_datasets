User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is there an easy way to see a log of SCP activity on a server (ala /var/log/secure for ssh login)? On Linux systems, /var/log/secure  (or similar, depending on distro) shows all SSH login activity.  Is there a similar log for SCP?  If not, what's a good approach to enabling logging of scp activity on my servers?  Is it SELinux through /var/log/audit/audit.log?

Assistant: You need to adjust your sshd logging level to DEBUG in order to see scp client connections.

Look at the /etc/ssh/sshd_config for the "LogLevel" directive.

LogLevel DEBUG


Or the scp -o LogLevel for testing.
