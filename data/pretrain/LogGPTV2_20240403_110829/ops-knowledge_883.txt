Question: "Why should an Android application developer NOT store cryptographic keys using predictable obfuscation functions or key derivation functions based on stable attributes?"
 "A": "Because it enhances the security of the keys by making them difficult to guess."
 "B": "Because it can lead to performance issues due to the complexity of the obfuscation algorithms."
 "C": "Because these methods provide strong security as they are based on stable and reliable attributes of the system."
 "D": "Because such practices are predictable and can be reverse-engineered, potentially exposing the keys to unauthorized access."
Answer: D
