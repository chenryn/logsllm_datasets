User: Your responsible application needs to process user requests quickly while keeping data safe. Please provide an architectural solution for ensuring high reliability and high performance.
Assistant: The architecture scheme is as follows: 1. Adopt a distributed architecture, split the application into multiple services, and each service is responsible for processing specific business logic. 2. Use load balancing technology to evenly distribute user requests to different service nodes to achieve high concurrent processing effects. 3. Introduce cache technology to cache hotspot data in the cache server, thereby improving data access speed. 4. Introduce a distributed database to solve the single point of failure problem and improve reliability and performance. 5. Adopt HTTPS protocol to encrypt data transmission to ensure data security. 6. The deployment of multiple computer rooms ensures the rapidity and fault tolerance of fault recovery. Even if there is a fault at the computer room level, the normal operation of the service can still be guaranteed. 7. Introduce a monitoring and alarm system to monitor the service running status in real time, and find and solve problems in time. The above solutions can meet the requirements of quickly processing user requests and ensuring data security. At the same time, the use of distributed architecture and load balancing technology has good scalability and improves the performance and reliability of the system.
