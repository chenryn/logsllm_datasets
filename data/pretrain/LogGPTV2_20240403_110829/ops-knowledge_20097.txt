User: Suppose we have a database cluster, how to achieve automatic failover and recovery when a node fails?
Assistant: The way to implement failover and recovery depends on the database cluster technology used and the specific architectural design. The following are some common implementation methods: 1. Master-slave replication: In the master-slave replication architecture, failover and recovery can be achieved by automatically electing a new slave node to replace the failed master node. Failover can be triggered by monitoring the heartbeat and sync status between the master and slave nodes. Once the switchover is complete, the system can recover by resynchronizing the data. 2. Multi-master architecture: In a multi-master architecture, failover usually requires the use of distributed locks or distributed transactions to ensure data consistency. If a master node fails, it is necessary to replace the failed node with a new master node by reassigning distributed locks or repairing distributed transactions. 3. Distributed file system: In a distributed file system, failover and recovery can be achieved by reallocating file blocks or modifying the location database. If a node fails, the failed node needs to be replaced with a new one by reallocating file blocks or modifying the location database. In summary, implementing failover and recovery requires a well-designed architecture, the use of appropriate technologies, and a combination of monitoring and automation.
