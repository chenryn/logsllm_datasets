Abstract. Even though most web users assume that only the websites
that they visit directly become aware of the visit, this belief is incorrect.
Many website display contents hosted externally by third-party websites,
which can track users and become aware of their web-surﬁng behavior.
This phenomenon is called third-party tracking, and although such activ-
ities violate no law, they raise privacy concerns because the tracking is
carried out without users’ knowledge or explicit approval. Our work pro-
vides a systematic study of the third-party tracking phenomenon. First,
we develop TrackAdvisor, arguably the ﬁrst method that utilizes Machine
Learning to identify the HTTP requests carrying sensitive information
to third-party trackers with very high accuracy (100 % Recall and 99.4
Precision). Microsoft’s Tracking Protection Lists, which is a widely-used
third-party tracking blacklist achieves only a Recall of 72.2 %. Second,
we quantify the pervasiveness of the third-party tracking phenomenon:
46 % of the home pages of the websites in Alexa Global Top 10,000 have
at least one third-party tracker, and Google, using third-party tracking,
monitors 25 % of these popular websites. Our overarching goal is to mea-
sure accurately how widespread third-party tracking is and hopefully
would raise the public awareness to its potential privacy risks.
1 Introduction
Would you feel that your privacy is violated if someone knew which websites
you visited last night? Most people would feel uneasy and want to ensure their
personal browsing information is not revealed to anyone else but the opposite is
exactly what has been happening thanks to a phenomenon called third-party
tracking. As a user visits a website of interest, third-party websites linked to
that website become aware of the user’s browsing activities and due to the ubiqui-
tous use of cookies, these third-parties can uniquely identify the user1. Although
1 In general, it is more accurate to say that third party tracking can track and identify
web-browsers and not end users. In the rest of this document, we will use the term
“tracking a user” to imply tracking the browser that is being used.

this can be appalling for privacy-sensitive users, there is no violation of laws.
The third-party tracker is legitimately contacted by the user’s browser, because
it hosts resources required by the website that the user wants to visit.
It is natural to ask why the third-party tracking phenomenon is occurring and
how. The answer to the “why” question is money, marketing, and advertising.
It is easy to see that knowing how many users watch golf scores and search for
luxury cars can help one place ads more eﬀectively. With third-party tracking,
ads on a website can be customized based on the user’s visits to other websites.
If you searched for yachts on one site, you could be shown yacht insurance ads
on another site. The answer to the “how” question is the widespread use of:
(a) embedded links on a webpage (think Facebook “Like” or Google+ “+1” but-
ton) or content being pulled from another site, and (b) cookies. Cookies turn
any browser into a silent accomplice as the browser voluntarily provides cook-
ies to the third-party websites. These cookies could have been obtained from a
tracking website at an earlier time (e.g. when we logged in to Facebook). The
obvious solution would not work: not sending cookies at all will often degrade
the user experience or even “break” the interaction with websites.
In our work, we want to answer two main questions: (a) How can we identify
cookie-based third-party tracking accurately? and (b) How widespread is the phe-
nomenon of third-party tracking? To address both questions, we need a method
that, when given a website and the HTTP interactions between users and that
website, can identify third-party trackers. The challenge lies in identifying fea-
tures of cookies and of the user interaction in general that can accurately identify
third-party trackers. This is non-trivial and there exists no such method in the
literature, as we discuss below. For the remainder of this paper, we use the term
privacy to refer to the right of a web-browsing user to not have a third-party
website become aware of websites that the user visits. We focus on cookie-based
tracking, because it is still the most prevalent form of tracking, as we discuss in
Sect. 7.
There has been very little attention on measuring the pervasiveness of third-
party tracking activities, which is our focus here. To the best of our knowledge,
the most widely-used approaches to combat the third-party tracking problem
rely on black lists of third-party trackers, which are maintained by corpora-
tions or communities. Microsoft’s Tracking Protection Lists (TPL) [7] is
one such prominent black list, which aggregates many others. As we show later,
these eﬀorts are far from perfect, as they are geared towards blocking the more
well-known third-party trackers. We discuss related and complementary research
eﬀorts in Sect. 7.
The contribution of this paper is a systematic study of the third-party track-
ing phenomenon and its extent. We also brieﬂy discuss practical countermeasures
to enable users to protect their web-browsing privacy. First, we propose TrackAd-
visor, an eﬀective method to detect third-party trackers that surpasses existing
third-party tracking lists in terms of both accuracy and detection. Second, we
use TrackAdvisor to study the prevalence of third-party tracking among Alexa’s
Global Top 10 K websites. We outline our key contributions and results below.

a. We develop TrackAdvisor, a supervised learning approach that
identiﬁes third-party trackers with high accuracy. A key novelty of our
approach is that it does not rely on a blacklist of websites; TrackAdvisor focuses
on the collective statistics of all cookies inside an outgoing third-party HTTP
request to infer whether the third-party website that receives those cookies is
tracking the user. Using Machine Learning techniques and carefully selected fea-
tures, our method exhibits a Precision of 99.4 and a Recall of 100 %.
b. We evaluate the accuracy and completeness of TPL and show
it yields a relatively low Recall of 72.2 %. Microsoft’s Tracking Protec-
tion Lists (TPL), which combines many existing blacklists, achieves a Recall of
72.2 % although with a high Precision of 96.3 %. TPL is incorporated in Inter-
net Explorer and can therefore be thought of as the protection that is readily
available to users. As a result, its low Recall is somewhat disconcerting.
c. We show that third-party tracking is prevalent: 46 % of Alexa’s
Global top 10 K sites being tracked. We ﬁnd that close to 46 % of the home
pages of the websites in Alexa’s Top 10,000 websites have at least one third-
party tracker and on average, one out of every three HTTP requests sent to
third-party websites is sent to a third-party tracker. More worrisomely, Google
is monitoring 25 % of the Alexa sites as a third party tracker through its ad and
analytics services. As expected, Facebook and Twitter are also prominent third-
party tracking, as Facebook “Like” and Twitter’s “Tweet” widgets have become
very common, especially on blogs and news-related websites. Interestingly, two
lesser known companies, Scorecard Research and QuantServe, are among the top
ﬁve third-party trackers in our dataset.
2 Background
A. Cookies. In the context of the HTTP protocol and web browsing, a cookie
is a small, local ﬁle (about 4KB in size) that helps a website identify a user and
their preferences and it is intended to quickly provide the remote website with
information such as language (for rendering the content in the correct language)
or geographic location (maybe for nearest store location). Cookies are created by
the website and stored on the device by the browser the ﬁrst time the user visits
the website. During every subsequent visit, the browser volunteers the saved
information to the website.
There are two main components to the structure of a cookie.
1. A Name and Value pair, which is explicitly set by the website. The pair can
be used to save a user’s language preference or geographic location. In the
case of a third-party tracker, the value portion will be assigned a string that
represents a user’s unique ID.
2. Attributes, which tell the browser how to handle the cookies. The most com-
mon attributes of the cookies are: (a) the domain that instructs the browser
which cookies to send to which websites upon visit and (b) the expiration,
which is a timestamp specifying to the browser when to a cookie is to be
discarded.

B. Third-party tracking. There are three parties involved in a user’s visiting
a website: the target website w (the ﬁrst party) the user wants to visit, the user
u (the second party), and the entities (the third party) hosting content external
to the website w. Third parties, in this case, are generally transparent to the
users and not all of them are third-party trackers.
As the browser needs to download third-party content, it must send an HTTP
request to each of the third parties. We call the ones that collect information
about the user at this stage third-party trackers.
Tracking mechanism: Although HTTP cookies are not the only means with
which third-party trackers keep track of users, they are the most popular. There
are three reasons to this. Firstly, all browsers can accept and send cookies. Sec-
ondly, other non-HTTP cookies exist and can be used for tracking, but they are
ineﬃcient or will create legal issues for the entities who utilize them. Finally,
even though third-party websites can track a user by their browser ﬁngerprint
[13], this method incurs a much higher overhead, thus is unlikely to adopted
widely. We will discuss browser ﬁngerprinting and other tracking mechanisms in
more details in Sect. 7.
3 Methodology
In this section we will: (1) discuss characteristics of HTTP requests going to
trackers and (2) provide an overview of our solution for the problem of detecting
third-party trackers.
A. HTTP Requests going to third-party trackers. The key question to
ask is whether there are characteristics that diﬀerentiate between: (1) HTTP
requests carrying information to third-party trackers that can uniquely identify
the user, and (2) HTTP requests that carry no such information.
We answer this question positively. The requests going to trackers contain
tracker cookies, which we deﬁne as a cookie that contains a name-value pair
that can uniquely identify a user. One such cookie, for instance, may have the
name-value pair: UID=163fkcs65bz where the value is simply a unique identiﬁer
given to the browser by the website. In contrast, there are non-tracker cookies,
which are used capture user preferences (e.g. display language, timezone), and
the browser provides to them to the website in each visit. Because tracker cookies
are meant to identify a user, they bear the following characteristics:
1. Their Lifetimes tends to be much longer than non-tracker cookies. A cookie’s
Lifetime is the time between its creation time and its expiration time.
2. The value part of the name-value pair inside each cookie (recall that each
cookie contains only one such pair) must have suﬃcient length to be able to
distinguish one user from many others.
In Fig. 1(a), we show the diﬀerence in the lifetime values between tracker
cookies and non-tracker cookies that we collected and manually labeled (see
Sect. 4 for more details on data collection). We can see that while less than 10 %
