## Abstract
The travel industry is increasingly adopting e-commerce applications to dynamically compose travel packages by aggregating and orchestrating distributed services. As the demand for customized travel itineraries grows, travel agencies are seeking technologies that offer their clients the flexibility to create unique packages from a wide array of options. This can be achieved efficiently, interoperably, and scalably through the use of Web services, Web processes, and semantic technologies. Semantics and ontologies facilitate a shared understanding of data among travelers and travel-related businesses, promoting the development of interoperable systems. This paper discusses the key issues related to the automatic or semi-automatic construction of Web processes for dynamic travel packaging, including Web services integration, the use of semantics and ontonomies, current standards, and the quality of service (QoS) of dynamic travel packaging Web processes.

## Keywords
Dynamic travel packaging, Web services, Web processes, semantics, workflows, process QoS.

## 1. Introduction
E-commerce and e-business have experienced rapid growth, driven by the ability to bridge geographical distances and connect buyers and sellers more efficiently. Consequently, organizations face the challenge of managing e-business systems, e-commerce applications, Web services, Web processes, and semantic technologies. The travel industry, in particular, stands to benefit significantly from these advancements.

One of the earliest adopters of electronic commerce was the travel industry, with systems like Sabre (operational since 1959). Today, the travel sector represents nearly 40% of all global e-commerce (Filho and Ramos, 2003). The shift from traditional offline distribution to online promotion and reservation processes has been marked by isolated B2C (business-to-customer) initiatives aimed at increasing profit margins and reducing commission costs.

However, many online reservation systems focus on individual products without an integrated view of vacation planning. To address this, the latest trend in the travel industry is dynamic packaging, which allows travelers to book flights, hotels, and rental cars in a single transaction, improving revenue and margins while offering cost savings to customers.

Our research aims to help the travel industry leverage Web services, Web processes, and semantics to develop dynamic packaging solutions. By using ontologies and semantics, we can define a common vocabulary and support communication across multiple channels, enhancing the flow of information and meeting the needs of both the travel industry and its customers.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the major issues and trends in dynamic travel packaging, Section 3 presents the current work in this field, and Section 4 provides our conclusions.

## 2. Issues of Dynamic Travel Packaging

### 2.1 Travel Industry Trends
Current trends in the travel industry include innovative technology solutions for various segments, such as dynamic packaging, travel agent tools, travel distribution, inventory management, back-office management, and web design. A significant trend is the adoption of dynamic travel packaging, which allows travelers to create a single reservation for all chosen components, regardless of their origin. Systems like Expedia, Travelocity.com, Hotels.com, and Orbitz.com are leading the way in dynamic packaging, offering travelers the ability to compare and book comprehensive travel packages.

### 2.2 Dynamic Travel Packaging Web Processes
Interoperability is a critical issue in e-commerce, as more companies establish B2C and B2B links to manage their value chains. For these links to be successful, heterogeneous systems from multiple companies must interoperate seamlessly. Web services and Web processes promise to ease infrastructure challenges, such as data, application, and process integration. Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) are essential for supporting, managing, and enacting Web processes, both within and between enterprises.

Once the Web services or applications are identified, a Web process flow model is constructed to depict the travel business process. The WfMS then automatically generates the necessary code to coordinate data and messaging between Web applications, using standards defined in the foundational level of the Web Service architecture. At runtime, the WfMS schedules Web services for execution based on the flow model specification.

### 2.3 Use of Semantics in Dynamic Travel Packaging
Web services alone are insufficient for developing sophisticated Web processes due to the heterogeneity, autonomy, and distribution of the Web. Incorporating semantics into Web services is essential for machine understandability and efficient solution deployment. The vision of the "Semantic Web" (Berners-Lee et al., 2001) is gaining traction, and ontologies are seen as the building blocks of this vision. In the context of tourism, ontologies are crucial for enabling machine-supported data interpretation and integration.

Semantic Web services will allow the automatic discovery, composition, integration, orchestration, and execution of inter-organizational business logic, making the Internet a global platform for commercial activities and value-added services. Major players in the travel industry, such as airlines, hoteliers, car rental companies, and travel agencies, are interested in creating and implementing industry-wide, open e-business specifications, tools, and Web processes involving Web services.

### 2.4 Ontology for the Travel Industry
The travel industry is focusing on developing open specifications messages based on XML to ensure interoperability between industry segments. For example, the OpenTravel Alliance (OTA, 2004) has produced over 140 XML-based specifications for the travel industry. However, these specifications are not sufficiently expressive to guarantee automatic information exchange and processing. Developing a suitable ontology for the tourism industry will provide a common language for travel-related terminology and promote seamless information exchange across all industry segments.

## 3. Current Work

## 4. Conclusions
[This section should summarize the key points discussed in the paper, highlight the importance of the research, and suggest future directions for the development of dynamic travel packaging using Web process technology.]
