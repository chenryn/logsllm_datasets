ABSTRACT
New trends in the travel industry require the ability to develop e-commerce applications to dynamically compose travel
packages from the aggregation and orchestration of distributed services. With the growth of demand for customized
travel itineraries, agencies seek technology that provides their clients the flexibility to build unique packages from a
selection of choices. Dynamic packages can be created and booked effortlessly with private and published air, car hire,
hotels, attractions and insurance rates. This can be accomplished in an efficient, interoperable, and scalable manner
through the development of a commonly accepted communication technology using Web services, Web processes and
semantics. Semantics and ontologies provide an agreed understanding of data between and among travelers and travel-
related businesses. Ontologies encourage the development of interoperable systems that can help create and support new
collections of travel services to better meet the demands and expectations of travelers and the travel industry. Our
objective in this paper is to discuss the major issues related to the automatic or semi-automatic construction of Web
processes managing dynamic travel packaging applications. Important aspects include Web services integration, the use
of semantics and ontologies, current standards, and the quality of service of dynamic travel packaging Web processes.
KEYWORDS
Dynamic travel packaging, Web services, Web processes, semantics, workflows, and process quality of service.
1. INTRODUCTION
E-commerce and e-business have been growing at a very fast pace. There is remarkable range for growth in
trade through electronic interactions, simply because it can eliminate geographical distances in bringing
buyers and sellers together. Therefore, organizations are increasingly faced with the challenge of managing e-
business systems, e-commerce applications, Web services, Web processes, workflows, and semantic. The
travel industry is one of main sectors that can find enormous benefits from the adoption of these latest
Internet technologies.
The travel industry, due to the long-distance interactions it requires, was one of the earliest electronic
commerce adopters (Sabre (SABRE 2004) system started operating in 1959). This industry is one of the most
important kind of commerce through the Web, representing almost 40% of all global electronic commerce
(Filho and Ramos 2003). With the Internet dissemination and the e-commerce growth there is a shift from the
traditional off-line distribution process based on operators’ catalogs to an on-line promotion and reservation
process. A shift that is marked by isolated initiatives guided by the B2C (business-to-customer) promise of
increased profit margins and reduced commission values.
This leads us to the present situation where we can find a diverse and numerous groups of on-line
reservation systems, most of them focused in one or in a few types of products without an integrated view of
vacation planning, that is what the consumer looks for. For this reason, the most recent trend for the travel
industry is based on dynamic packaging. Dynamic packaging improves revenues and margins per transaction
while offering travelers new opportunities to save by booking flights, hotels or rental cars together in a single
transaction.
Our research objective is to help the travel industry to take full advantage of the latest Internet
technologies, such as Web services, Web processes, and semantics to develop dynamic packaging solutions.
Semantics allow rich descriptions of Web services and Web processes that can be used by computers for
automatic or semi-automatic processing in various tourism related applications. The deployment of
ontologies and semantics help articulate a well-defined set of common data elements or vocabulary that can
support communication across multiple channels, expedite the flow of information, and meet travel industry
and customer needs.
This paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 is extent and represents the major section of this
paper. We discuss the current travel industrial trends, the issues and solutions related to the construction of
dynamic travel packaging applications. Section 3 presents the current work on this field. Finally, section 4
presents our conclusions.
2. ISSUES OF DYNAMIC TRAVEL PACKAGING
Our research is dedicated to help the travel industry to take full advantage of the near universal access to the
Internet. In this section we discuss the latest travel industry trends to motivate the reader for the importance
of dynamic travel packages. We explain the challenges and benefits of using Web processes to create and
manage dynamic travel packaging applications (workflows). Since the distributed nature of the Web creates
interoperability problems between Web services when creating Web processes, we discuss the importance of
using semantics and ontologies to develop solutions for the travel industry. Finally, we give a brief
introduction to the importance of quality of service metrics implementing Web processes dynamic travel
packaging.
2.1 Travel Industry Trends
Current trends include innovative technology solutions for various segment of the travel industry, focusing
on dynamic packaging, travel agent tools, travel distribution, inventory management, back-office
management, and Web design.
A major trend is the dissemination of dynamic travel packaging technology. The objective of dynamic
packaging is to pack all the components chosen by a traveler to create one reservation. Regardless of where
the inventory originates, the package that is created is handled seamlessly as one transaction, and requires
only one payment from the consumer. These systems allow comparison shopping of packages that can
include plane tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars, insurance, leisure tickets and other services.
Expedia has pioneered this concept allowing for the packaging of air, hotel, and car on the fly, either
during the research phase or at point-of-sale. Travelocity.com, Hotels.com, and Orbitz.com are aggressively
pursuing dynamic packaging as there are tremendous opportunities in this approach.
2.2 Dynamic Travel Packaging Web processes
Interoperability is a key issue in e-Commerce because more and more companies are creating B2C
(Business-to-Customer) and B2B (Business-to-Business) links to better manage their value chain. In order for
these B2C and B2B links to be successful, heterogeneous systems from multiple companies need to
interoperate seamlessly. Automating inter-organizational processes across supply chains presents significant
challenges (Stohr and Zhao 2001).
Web services and Web processes promise to ease several of nowadays infrastructure challenges, such as
data, application, and process integration. With the emergence of Web services, workflow management
system become essential to support, manage, and enact Web processes, both between enterprises and within
the enterprise (Sheth, Aalst et al. 1999). Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) are promoted based on
their application integration capabilities by executing Web services and orchestrating Web processes.
Several researchers have identified workflows as the computing model that enables a standard method of
building Web Services applications and processes to connect and exchange information over the Web (Chen,
Dayal et al. 2000; German Shegalov, Michael Gillmann et al. 2001; Fensel and Bussler 2002).
Once the applications or Web services are identified, a Web process flow model depicting the travel
business process is constructed. Based on this model, the WfMS automatically generates the appropriate code
to coordinate the flow of data and messaging between the Web applications using standards defined in the
foundational level of the Web Service architecture. At runtime, the WfMS reads the flow model specification
and transparently schedules Web services for execution.
2.3 Use of Semantics in Dynamic Travel Packaging
There is a growing consensus that Web services alone will not be sufficient to developed valuable and
sophisticated Web processes due the degree of heterogeneity, autonomy, and distribution of the Web. Several
researchers agree that it is essential for Web services to incorporate semantics in order to be machine
understandable to allow the full deployment of efficient solutions supporting all the phases of the lifecycle of
Web processes.
The idea and vision of the “Semantic Web” (Berners-Lee, Hendler et al. 2001) catches on and researchers
as well as companies have already realized the benefits of this great vision. Ontologies (Uschold and
Gruninger 1996) are considered the basic building block of the semantic Web as they allow machine
supported data interpretation reducing human involvement in data and process integration. For the tourism
industry, the development of ontologies is fundamental to allow machine supported travel related data
interpretation and integration.
Semantic Web services will allow the automatic discovery, composition, integration, orchestration, and
execution of inter-organization business logic, making the Internet become a global common platform where
organizations and individuals communicate among each other to carry out various commercial activities and
to provide value-added services. In the context of tourism, there is a great interest of such powerful
capabilities. Major airlines, hoteliers, car rental companies, leisure suppliers, travel agencies and others are
interested in creating and implementing industry-wide, open e-business specifications, tools and Web
processes involving Web services.
2.4 Ontology for the Travel Industry
Currently, the travel industry has concentrated their efforts on developing open specifications messages,
based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), to ensure that messages can flow between industry segments
as easily as within. For example, the OpenTravel Alliance (OTA 2004) is an organization pioneering the
development and use of specifications that support e-business among all segments of the travel industry. It
has produced more than 140 XML-based specifications for the travel industry.
The current development of open specifications messages based on XML, such as OTA schema, to ensure
the interoperability between trading partners and working groups is not sufficiently expressive to guaranty an
automatic exchange and processing of information. The development of a suitable ontology for the tourism
industry will serve as a common language for travel-related terminology and a mechanism for promoting the
seamless exchange of information across all travel industry segments.
