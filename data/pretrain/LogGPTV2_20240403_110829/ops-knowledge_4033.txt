User: whats is the current best practice for installing multiple versions of python on snow leopard?

have setup python 2.7.1 via Homebrew, very easy process, all great.
but now I need to setup python 2.5 to develop an appengine project..  Initially created a new virtualenv against system python2.5 .. but finding I have all kinds of PATH issues. Seems at this point it would be better not to use Homebrew and go with a more standard setup?

any thoughts ?
Assistant: I use the python_select utility to switch between versions (it takes care of all the paths and links).  It's easy to install with MacPorts or fink, so I would guess you can install the same utility with Homebrew.
