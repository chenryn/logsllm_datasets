What is the current best practice for installing multiple versions of Python on Snow Leopard?

I have successfully set up Python 2.7.1 using Homebrew, which was a straightforward process. However, I now need to set up Python 2.5 to work on an App Engine project. Initially, I created a new virtual environment using the system's Python 2.5, but I encountered numerous PATH issues. At this point, it seems that using Homebrew may not be the best approach, and I am considering a more standard setup.

Do you have any suggestions or thoughts on this matter?

In response to your situation, I recommend using the `python_select` utility, which allows you to easily switch between different Python versions and manages all the necessary paths and links. This utility can be installed via MacPorts or Fink. While I'm not entirely sure if it is available through Homebrew, it would be worth checking. If it is, this could provide a more streamlined solution for managing multiple Python versions on your system.
