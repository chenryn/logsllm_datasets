Abstract. The IPv6 privacy extension introduces temporary addresses
to protect against address-based correlation, i.e., the attribution of diﬀer-
ent transactions to the same origin using addresses, and is considered as
state-of-the-art mechanism for privacy protection in IPv6. In this paper,
we scrutinize the extension’s capability for protection by analyzing its
algorithm for temporary address generation in detail. We develop an
attack that is based on two insights and shows that the notion of protec-
tion is false: First, randomization is scarce and future identiﬁers can be
predicted once the algorithm’s internal state is known. Second, a victim’s
temporary addresses form a side channel and allow an adversary to syn-
chronize to this internal state. Finally, we highlight mitigation strategies,
and recommend a revision of the extension’s speciﬁcation.
1 Introduction
Snowden’s revelations on the National Security Agency’s surveillance program
startled the global public due to its sheer extent and sophistication. Practically
everbody’s Internet communication is collected. The gained data is ﬁltered, ana-
lyzed, measured and ﬁnally stored for the purpose of compounding a precise
picture of Internet users [1,2]. But other actors are also after massive amounts
of user data: Western democracies, e.g., in the European Union or Australia,
often introduce telecommunication data retention. Commercial enterprises spy
on their customers on a massive scale to increase monetary revenue [3,4], and
criminals may do so as well.
The power of such an approach lies in its capability of making sense from large
amounts of data that seem unrelated to each other by combing countless pieces
of information [5]. This means that a person’s diﬀerent activities on the Internet
can be correlated to each other, and this condensed information typically exceeds
what people believe can be found out about their lives. Addresses play a sensitive
role in this: On the one hand, an address has to accurately identify the receiver
so that traﬃc reaches its intended destination. On the other hand, address-based
correlation enables the attribution of diﬀerent transactions to the same origin
and allows to gain insights into others’ Internet behavior. General protection
strategies against correlation like an attribute’s removal or its encryption seem
inadequate for addresses as intermediate nodes require access for appropriate
data delivery.

Addressing, in turn, is heavily dependent on the protocol, and IPv6 intro-
duced new aspects in the matter of address-based correlation. Initially, all
addresses of an interface were deﬁned to include a globally unique identiﬁer
and thus allowed simplest address correlation over an interface’s full lifetime [6].
In response, temporary addresses that change by default every 24 h were intro-
duced. This mechanism is known as the privacy extension [7], and is considered
as state-of-the-art privacy protection in IPv6 [8]. It is implemented in major
desktop and mobile operating systems.
In this paper, we scrutinize the IPv6 privacy extension’s capability of protect-
ing against address-based correlation, and therefore focus on the algorithm for
temporary address generation. We ﬁnd that once the algorithm’s state is known
by an adversary, she is able to accurately predict a victim’s future addresses.
Beyond that, we develop a way that allows an adversary to synchronize to the
victim’s state by exploiting observed temporary addresses as a side channel,
and appraise the attacker’s eﬀort to perform our attack with currently available
technology. Our results yield 3.3 years of hashing but advances in technology
are going to decrease this time period. We highlight mitigation strategies; how-
ever, our most important contribution may be the impetus for a revision of the
extension’s speciﬁcation.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 provides details
on addressing in IPv6 and the privacy extension. Section 3 summarizes related
work focusing on privacy implications of competing IPv6 addressing standards
as well as known vulnerabilities of the privacy extension. Section 4 describes the
assumed attack scenario and is followed by a security analysis of the extension’s
address generation algorithm that identiﬁes four weaknesses in Sect. 5. Based on
these insights, the development of our attack is described in Sect. 6. Its feasibility
is discussed in Sect. 7, which is followed by an investigation of current operating
systems’ vulnerability in Sect. 8. Strategies for mitigation are presented in Sect. 9,
and Sect. 10 concludes the paper.
2 Background
This section provides background on IPv6 addressing in general: the address struc-
ture, address assignment and their implications for address-based correlation. In
a second step, we focus on the IPv6 privacy extension and describe its principal
idea as well as its algorithm for temporary interface identiﬁer generation.
IPv6 Addressing: IPv6 addresses have a length of 128 bit and are portioned
into two distinct parts of equal size as depicted in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst 64 bits form
the network preﬁx, and are dependent on a host’s location in the network. The
remaining 64 bits form the interface identiﬁer (IID) that enables a subscriber’s
identiﬁcation on the link. Address conﬁguration for clients is done via stateless
address autoconﬁguration [9] and does not require human intervention: Routers
advertise the network preﬁx on the network, and hosts form their global IPv6
addresses by combining the announced preﬁx with a self-generated interface
identiﬁer.

Fig. 1. IPv6 addresses using interface identiﬁers in modiﬁed EUI-64 format
The interface identiﬁer was initially intended to follow the modiﬁed EUI-
64 format [6] that infers an interface identiﬁer from the 48 bit media access
control (MAC) address, see also Fig. 1. The MAC address consists of a 24 bit
organizationally unique identiﬁer, and a network interface card (NIC)-speciﬁc
part of equal size. A ﬁxed pattern of two bytes is inserted between these parts
and a universal/local bit is set to one in order to form the identiﬁer.
The MAC address is globally unique and typically remains stable over a
host’s lifetime1. Consequently, the interface identiﬁer that is included in every
IPv6 address is globally unique and stable as well. All addresses of a certain host
have the same second half, while their network preﬁx changes according to the
visited location. An adversary is thus able to attribute various transactions to
the same origin based on the identiﬁer and trace a host’s Internet behavior even
beyond a certain sub-network. The adversary is further able to retrace a host’s
movement in the network as the included network preﬁxes allow localization.
The IPv6 Privacy Extension: The privacy extension is presented as a solu-
tion that impedes correlation “when diﬀerent addresses used in diﬀerent transac-
tions actually correspond to the same node” [7]. Its basic principle are interface
identiﬁers that change at a regular interval of typically 24 h. Hosts form tempo-
rary IPv6 addresses from the announced preﬁx in combination with the current
interface identiﬁer, and change the IPv6 address with every newly generated
identiﬁer. An expired address is considered deprecated and not used for new
connections, but still serves already active transactions.
A host’s successive interface identiﬁers have to be chosen in a way that
appears random to outsiders and hinders them in attributing diﬀerent identi-
ﬁers to the same origin. Thus the IPv6 privacy extension deﬁnes an algorithm
for a pseudo-random generation of these temporary identiﬁers as described in
the following and depicted in Fig. 2:

modiﬁed EUI-64 format.
gain a digest of 128 bit length.
1 Technically speaking the MAC remains stable over the NIC’s lifetime, but we suppose
that personal computers, laptops, tablets and mobiles keep their NIC over their whole
lifetime.

3. The digest’s leftmost 64 bits are extracted and bit 6 is set to zero in order to
form the temporary interface identiﬁer.
4. The digest’s rightmost 64 bits form the next iteration’s history value and are
stored.
5. In case the generated interface identiﬁer is found to be used by other local
devices or reserved, the process is restarted to gain another identiﬁer.
The very ﬁrst history value is initialized with a random value the ﬁrst time a
system boots. This algorithm is deﬁned for systems with present stable storage,
which is necessary to keep the history value across system restarts. Devices like
stationary PCs, laptops, tablets and smart phones are typically considered to
have such storage. However, in its absence, it is allowed to randomly re-initialize
the history value after every system restart.
Temporary IPv6 addresses are assigned in addition to stable addresses in
modiﬁed EUI-64 format, and do not replace them in order to prevent negative
impacts on addressing. Temporary addresses are used in outgoing connections
to stay private, while stable addresses make it possible to stay reachable for
incoming requests.
3 Related Work
Our research has a two-pronged foundation: First, we discuss various IPv6
address structures with respect to privacy, and highlight the IPv6 privacy exten-
sion’s outstanding positions due to its capability to protect against geographical
as well as temporal address-based correlation. This further emphasizes why the
extension’s secure standardization and implementation is an important aspect
of IPv6 privacy. Second, we summarize previously discovered vulnerabilities of
the privacy extension, and illustrate their minor importance in comparison to
the new attack that we present in this paper.
3.1 IPv6 Address Formats and Address Correlation
There are ways to form IPv6 interface identiﬁers for stateless address autoconﬁg-
uration beyond the modiﬁed EUI-64 format and the privacy extension: (1) man-
ually conﬁgured stable identiﬁers, (2) semantically opaque identiﬁers [10] and
452

(3) cryptographically generated addresses (CGAs) [11]. CGAs, however, require
authenticated messages as deﬁned by Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND) [12]
instead of plain Neighbor Discovery [13].
We discussed these alternatives with respect to an adversary’s capability for
address correlation, and consider two distinct aspects of address correlation:
– Temporal correlation refers to address-based correlation over multiple sessions
– Geographical correlation refers to address-based correlation over multiple ses-
of a stationary host.
sions of a mobile node.
The diﬀerence is the network preﬁx: A stationary host stays in the same
sub-network and includes the same network preﬁx in all its addresses. A mobile
node wanders and changes the network preﬁx when moving.
Addresses using the modiﬁed EUI-64 format include the globally unique MAC
address, and all of a host’s addresses are equivalent in their second part. This fact
allows the correlation of multiple sessions of a stationary or mobile node, i.e., this
type of address is vulnerable to both forms of address correlation and, beyond
that, also for active host tracking [14,15]. Apart from global uniqueness, the
same is valid for (manually conﬁgured) interface identiﬁers that remain static.
Semantically opaque interface identiﬁers are generated by hashing the net-
work preﬁx and a secret key among other parameters. As the hash calculation
includes the address preﬁx, the interface identiﬁer changes from subnet to subnet
and prevents geographical correlation. The identiﬁer, however, remains stable in
a certain network, even when returning from another network, and allows tem-
poral correlation over long periods of time. Due to their recent standardization
their availability in current operating systems is limited.
Cryptographically generated addresses are generated by hashing the public
key and other parameters and are bound to certain hosts. Ownership is veri-
ﬁed by signing messages that originate from this address with the corresponding
private key. The network preﬁx is included as a parameter into hashing, and a
node’s CGA changes from network to network, preventing geographical corre-
lation of traﬃc. However, their generation comes at high computational costs,
and prevents address changes as a means of protection against temporal corre-
lation in practise [16]. An approach to overcome the limitation with respect to
frequent address change has been proposed [17]. However, CGAs and SeND lack
acceptance and are neither widely implemented nor deployed.
The discussion is summarized in Table 1, and is accompanied by the capa-
bilities’ native availability in the current client operating systems Mac OS X
Yosemite, Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) and Windows 8.1, see Table 2. The
results emphasizes the unique position of the privacy extension: First, it is
the only mechanism using stateless address autoconﬁguration that is currently
deployed at a larger scale that is intended to protect against traﬃc correlation.
Second, it is the only mechanism that considers protection against temporal as
well as geographical address correlation.
In this paper, we develop an attack that overcomes the belief that the privacy
extension provides adequate protection against address correlation. The attack
