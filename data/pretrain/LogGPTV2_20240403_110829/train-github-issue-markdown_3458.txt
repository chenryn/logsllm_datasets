### Summary
The `pip` module in Ansible is designed to verify and install specific versions of Python libraries on the target host. However, it currently does not support version ranges.

### Steps to Reproduce
To demonstrate the need for this feature, consider the following task:

```yaml
- name: Verify dependencies
  pip:
    name: docker-py
    version: > 1.7.0
```

In this example, the `pip` module should be able to handle a version range (e.g., `> 1.7.0`) and ensure that the specified library is installed with a version greater than `1.7.0`.

### Expected Behavior
The `pip` module should support version ranges, allowing users to specify a range of acceptable versions for a package. This would provide more flexibility in managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility with a range of package versions.
