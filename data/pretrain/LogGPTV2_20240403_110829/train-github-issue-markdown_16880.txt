## Expected Behavior
I should be able to add a `.babelrc` with a custom plugin and the `next/babel`
preset and everything should work without having to include the `env` preset.
## Current Behavior
When doing this I'm getting the following error when running tests (with
Jest):
    ~/Developer/glamorous-with-next (pr/fix-config)
    😇  $ npm run test --silent
     FAIL  components/__tests__/toggle-button.js
      ● Test suite failed to run
        /Users/kdodds/Developer/glamorous-with-next/components/__tests__/toggle-button.js:1
        ({"Object.":function(module,exports,require,__dirname,__filename,global,jest){var _jsxFileName = '/Users/kdodds/Developer/glamorous-with-next/components/__tests__/toggle-button.js';import React from 'react';
                                                                                                                                                                                                        ^^^^^^
        SyntaxError: Unexpected token import

    Ran all test suites.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Run the following script (from a directory of your choosing):
    mkdir next-preset-issue
    cd next-preset-issue
    npm init -y
    npm install next react react-dom jest babel-preset-env --save
    echo "{\"presets\": [\"next/babel\"]}" > .babelrc
    echo "import fs from 'fs';test('works', () => {});" > index.test.js
    ./node_modules/.bin/jest
    echo "{\"presets\": [\"next/babel\", \"env\"]}" > .babelrc
    ./node_modules/.bin/jest
You'll notice that the first invocation of `jest` will fail with the error
above, but the second (after adding the `env` preset has been added) will
succeed.
## Context
I'm making a course for glamorous and I want to show how to do server
rendering and testing. Next.js is the obvious choice, but I want to make sure
I'm doing things properly and no more than necessary. If it's necessary to add
the `env` preset that's fine, but I want to make sure that I understand why
it's necessary.
