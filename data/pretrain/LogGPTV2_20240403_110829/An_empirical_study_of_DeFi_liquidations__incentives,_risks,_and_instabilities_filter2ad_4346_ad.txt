essarily leads to an accumulation of Type I bad debt. We measure
the number of unprofitable liquidation opportunities in Table 3.
Given the average transaction fee at the time of writing, we choose
a transaction cost of 100 USD for a single liquidation. Remarkably,
by block 12344944 (30th Apr 2021), we have identified 350 unprof-
itable liquidation opportunities on Compound, which corresponds
to 125,722 USD worth of collateral. Rational liquidators will not
attempt to liquidate unprofitable lending positions. Therefore, these
positions will inevitably become Type I bad debts, if their health
factor continues to fall.
Flash Loan Usages. Fixed spread liquidations can be con-
4.4.4
ducted in one transaction alone, which reduces the complexity and
risk for the liquidators. For instance, liquidators do not need to
hold any assets ready to repay debt for a liquidation. Instead, the
liquidators can resort to flash loan pools, lend the required capital
to repay debt, and pay back the flash loan interests by the end of
the liquidation call. A typical flow of a flash loan liquidation works
as follows:
(1) The liquidator borrows a flash loan in currency 𝑋 to repay
the debt.
(2) The liquidator repays the borrower’s debt with a flash loan
and receives collateral in currency 𝑌 at a premium.
(3) The liquidator exchanges parts of the purchased collateral
in exchange for currency 𝑋.
(4) To conclude the flash loan, the liquidator repays the flash
loan together with flash loan interest. The remaining profit
lies with the liquidator. If the liquidation is not profitable,
the flash loan would not succeed.
To understand to what degree liquidators engage in flash loans,
we study the flash loan pools of Aave and dYdX (which also act as
lending pools). We therefore filter the relevant events in the liqui-
dation transactions that apply to flash loans. For our observation
window, we observe a total of 623 flash loans, that are borrowed
for liquidations. The accumulative flash loan amount lent sums
up to 483.83M USD. We summarize further details in Table 4. In
the table, we include the flash loans that are borrowed before and
repaid after liquidation. We notice that in terms of accumulative
amounts, dYdX flash loans are more popular than Aave, likely due
to the low interest rate of dYdX flash loans.

4.5 Instabilities
In this section, we discuss the lending platform instabilities due to
cryptocurrency price fluctuations.
4.5.1 Liquidation Sensitivity. To understand how the lending plat-
forms respond to price declines of different currencies, we quantify
the liquidation sensitivity, i.e., the amount of collateral that would
be liquidated, if the price of the collateral would decline by up to
100%. We again capture Aave V2, Compound, MakerDAO, and dYdX
in the snapshot state at block 123449446 to provide an exhaustive
understanding of borrower risk profiles.
We detail how we measure the liquidation sensitivity in Al-
gorithm 1. Specifically, we examine whether each debt becomes
liquidatable because of the price decline of the given cryptocur-
rency. Note that when counting the liquidatable collateral value,
we consider the value decrease due to the price decline. We then
present the sensitivity results in Figure 8. We find that all of the
four lending platforms are sensitive to the price decline of ETH. For
example, an immediate 43% decline of the ETH price (analogous to
the ETH price decline on the 13th of March, 2020), would result in
up to 1.07B USD collateral to become liquidatable on MakerDAO.
To our surprise, although Aave V2 and Compound follow similar
liquidation mechanisms and have similar TVL, Aave V2 is more
stable to price declines in terms of liquidatable collateral. By manu-
ally inspecting, we find that this is because Aave V2 users prefer
adopting a multiple-cryptocurreny collateral. Hence, the positions
in Aave V2 are less likely to become liquidatable due to the price
decline of a single cryptocurrency.
Stability of Stablecoins. We observe that certain borrow-
4.5.2
ers collateralize one stablecoin and borrow another stablecoin.
Through such strategy, a borrower reduces the likelihood of liq-
uidations, because the prices of stablecoins are deemed stable (cf.
Section 2.2.3). To measure the stability of this stablecoin borrowing
strategy, we collect the prices of three popular stablecoins, DAI,
USDC, and USDT, reported by the price oracle Chainlink [33], from
block 9976964 (May-01-2020) to 12344944 (Apr-30-2021). We find
that the price differences among the three stablecoins is within 5%
in 99.97% of the measured 2,367,981 blocks (1 year). This indicates
that the aforementioned stablecoin borrowing strategy could have
been stable for most of the time in 2020. However, we remark that
6We ignore Aave V1 in the sensitivity measurement because the majority of the
liquidity of Aave V1 had been migrated to Aave V2 at block 12344944.

Figure 8: Liquidation sensitivity to price decline in four lending platforms. Liquidation sensitivity denotes the amount of
collateral that would be liquidated, if the price of the collateral would decline by up to 100%. We find that all of the four
lending platforms are sensitive to the price decline of ETH. Although Aave V2 and Compound follow similar liquidation
mechanisms and have similar TVL, Aave V2 is more stable to price declines.
liquidation risks still remain. The maximum price difference we
detect is 11.1% between USDC and DAI at block 10578280.
4.6 Remarks
Our measurements and analysis provide the following insights on
DeFi liquidation mechanisms.
(1) Existing liquidation mechanisms generate remarkable finan-
cial rewards for liquidators (cf. Section 4.3.1). Liquidators
are well incentivized to actively perform liquidations. This
is confirmed by the severe gas price competition among
liquidation transactions (cf. Section 4.3.2) and short bid inter-
vals in auction liquidations (cf. Section 4.3.3). However, the
fixed spread liquidation allows liquidators to over-liquidate
a borrowing position, which incurs unnecessary losses to
the borrowers (cf. Section 4.4.1).
(2) Excessive transaction fees necessarily lead to unprofitable
liquidation opportunities and Type II bad debt. Overdue liq-
uidations increase the likelihood of Type I bad debt (cf. Sec-
tion 4.4.2 and Section 4.4.3).
345
(3) Fixed spread liquidators can use flash loans to eliminate the
risk of holding a specific asset (cf. Section 4.4.4). Auction
liquidators are exposed to the risk of price fluctuations during
auctions, and may hence suffer a loss (cf. Appendix A).
(4) We show that at the time of writing, the studied lending
platforms in this work (Aave V2, Compound, dYdX, and
MakerDAO) are sensitive (i.e., the amount of the liquidatable
collateral due to the price decline of a cryptocurrency) to the
price decline of ETH (cf. Section 4.5.1).
(5) We evaluate the lending and borrowing practice when fo-
cussing exclusively on stablecoins. We show that such strat-
egy mitigates the risk of liquidations for most of the time,
while liquidations can still occur (cf. Section 4.5.2).

March, 2020 (cf. Section 4). Surprisingly, while Aave follows the
same liquidation mechanism of Compound, the profit-volume ratio
of Aave, especially Aave V1, remains below Compound. We infer
that this is because the number of DAI/ETH liquidations events on
Aave are rare (cf. Table 8, Appendix B) — we hence believe that the
Aave market is not sufficiently indicative to draw a representative
conclusion. Overall our results suggest that the auction mechanism
favors the borrowers more than a fixed spread liquidation with a
close factor beyond 50%.
5.2 Optimal Fixed Spread Liquidation Strategy
The configuration of a close factor (cf. Section 2.3) restricts the
profit of the liquidator (i.e., the loss of the borrower) in a single fixed
spread liquidation. We denote the strategy of liquidating up to the
close factor limit within a single liquidation as the up-to-close-factor
strategy. Intuitively, a liquidator is rational to perform the up-to-
close-factor strategy, because the profit is positively correlated to
the liquidation amount. However, we find that a liquidator can lift
the restriction of the close factor by performing two successive
liquidations. The optimal strategy leverages the rule that a position
remains liquidatable as long as it is in an unhealthy state, no matter
this position has been liquidated or not previously.
In this optimal strategy, instead of pushing to close factor limit,
the liquidator liquidates as much as possible but still keeps the
position in an unhealthy state in the first liquidation. Then, in the
second liquidation, the liquidator liquidates the remaining collateral
up to the close factor. We detail the optimal fixed spread liquidation
strategy in Algorithm 2.
5.2.1 Optimality Analysis. Given a liquidatable borrowing position
with 𝐶 collateral value and 𝐷 debt (cf. Equation 5), we proceed to
analyze the profit of our optimal strategy.

LT, LS, CR denote the liquidation threshold, liquidation spread and

Figure 9: Comparison of the monthly liquidation profit over the monthly average collateral volume for the DAI/ETH lending
markets. The lower the profit-volume ratio is, the better the liquidation protocol is for borrower.
Following Algorithm 2, the repaid debt amounts in the two suc-
cessive liquidations are given in Equation 6 and 7. Note that the
𝐷 − LT · 𝐶 > 0 because POS is liquidatable (i.e., the debt is
greater than the borrowing capacity). We show in Appendix C
that a reasonable fixed spread liquidation configuration satisfies
1 − LT(1 + LS) > 0.
