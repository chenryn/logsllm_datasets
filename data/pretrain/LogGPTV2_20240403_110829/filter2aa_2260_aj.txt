The Tampa Bay UA has integrated formal and informal SOPs for most aspects of its interoperable 
communications into its Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).  The TICP represents the first 
set of regional interoperability SOPs and has been embraced by the area.  The TICP is being regularly 
updated and disseminated to all agencies.  Adherence to the Florida Interoperability Network (FIN) policies 
were an area of difficulty during the TICP validation exercise, perhaps because FIN policies are new and had 
not been added to the TICP nor practiced by participating agencies.  Tampa Bay officials report that they are 
in the process of implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command 
System (ICS) through training.  NIMS principles appear to have been integrated into fire operations, but less 
so within the area’s law enforcement community.  Additionally, the exercise evaluators noted that 
establishing unified command among incident commands was an issue, which limited the effectiveness of the 
Communications Unit Leader in managing the two incident sites.

Multi-agency communications occur daily in the Tampa Bay UA on its two major shared 800 megahertz 
(MHz) systems, and console patches are regularly used to connect the City of Tampa Police Department’s  
disparate system.  The Tampa Bay UA adequately demonstrated the ability to interoperate during what 
evaluators noted was a complex exercise.  For example, gateways were effectively used at one of the exercise 
sites, but at the other site, participants had trouble connecting the gateway to FIN and a required tactical 
channel was not found on one of the consoles.  As noted in the post-exercise Improvement Plan, additional 
training on the use of fixed gateways (specifically the newly implemented FIN) could be pursued to address 
identified gaps (e.g., difficulty establishing communications and in using the FIN for communications).  
Additionally, the reliance on commercial services for mission-critical communication was outside the scope 
of documented procedures.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to train and exercise on available technology (e.g., gateways) to improve familiarity with and 
use of their interoperable communications capability 
• 
Consider developing policy on use and limitations of commercial services (e.g., cellular telephones) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Tampa Bay UA, designated as the RDSTF—Region 4  by the state, has many agencies operating on trunked, 800 
MHz systems.  These include both M/A-COM and Motorola systems that do not directly provide for interoperability.  
Additionally, distant counties rely on ultra high frequencies (UHF), both simplex and trunked, for their primary 
communications.  The state is building out mutual aid channels in UHF and 800 MHz bands and has implemented a 
Voice over Internet Protocol solution connecting nearly all public safety answering points. 
The Tampa Police Department has initiated a process to migrate to a Project 25-compliant system.  This will give the 
surrounding counties an opportunity to improve interoperability.  Tampa Bay also applied for a United States 
Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services grant.  Although the application was rejected, officials are 
planning to resubmit.  Furthermore, a mobile 10-channel, 800 MHz trunked Motorola system in Pinellas County is also 
available to the UA.  It has been extensively used in past years to support response and recovery operations for local and 
out-of-area hurricane damage.

Communications interoperability issues in the Atlanta UA are governed by a Steering Committee consisting 
of representatives of the core jurisdictions of the City of Atlanta, Dekalb, and Fulton counties.  The Steering 
Committee accepts recommendations directly from the All Hazards Council Area 7 Communications 
Subcommittee.  This subcommittee has become more active in communications interoperability due to its 
involvement with the development of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).  While the 
subcommittee has a broad list of participating agencies, it is not clear whether this group of state, federal, and 
support organizations are included as officials subcommittee members.  There are published and active 
agreements in place that facilitate communications interoperability with some agencies in the UA (e.g., 
mutual aid agreement in place among Cobb, Fulton, Georgia State Patrol, and City of Atlanta).  In addition, 
the documentation provided indicates that the Atlanta UA is developing an interoperable communications 
strategy that would build upon the broad goals set forth in the Urban Area Homeland Security Strategic Plan, 
which was the basis for the TICP development.  Once developed, the strategic plan will address 
interoperability beyond the operational focus of the TICP and the broader scope of the Urban Area 
Homeland Security Strategic Plan.  It appears that current funding decisions are based on individual agency 
needs as opposed to regional priorities, which limits coordinated planning to meet longer term 
interoperability goals.  The Atlanta UA leadership has been involved in the TICP process.  For example, two 
city Mayors are involved in the All Hazards Council Area 7/UA Working Group.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Encourage public support, state, and federal agency participation (e.g., utilities) in the decision-making 
group and define roles and responsibilities 
• 
Establish processes to develop and review agreements (e.g., usage agreements, memoranda of 
understanding) at least every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or upgrades   
• 
Document and implement the regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP), with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance 
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into the strategic plan, such as considering 
funding models (in addition to grants) that can leverage local, regional, and statewide strategic planning 
efforts 
• 
Continue to broaden and champion a governance structure that would more fully support regional 
communications interoperability 
• 
Given the area’s progress to date, motivate broader acceptance of interoperability as both a political and 
fiscal priority for the area and state

The Atlanta UA TICP was built on existing SOPs, including regional SOPs developed through the 
Department of Justice 25 Cities Project.  The UA has taken numerous steps to disseminate the TICP to all 
participating agencies (e.g., distribute to dispatch centers and through TICP Implementation Workshop, 
available with gateways).  The Atlanta UA has also already updated the plan since its submittal, including a 
newly implemented Project 25 (P25) system.  Use of these communications interoperability SOPs were 
successfully demonstrated during the TICP validation exercise.  The Atlanta UA has been implementing the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) within the last year.  
Although the TICP validation exercise showed that both law and fire commanders were proficient in NIMS, 
it was noted in the After Action Report that law enforcement needs additional command and control training.  
It was notable that the Communications Unit Leader (COML) showed “extensive knowledge of his 
equipment and ways to create interoperable communications.” 
Recommendation: 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance 
Usage: Advanced Implementation 
The Atlanta UA has 26 separate radio systems that provide communications to first responder and support 
agencies.  Despite this diverse infrastructure, the UA has been successful in using interoperable 
communications assets in its TICP validation exercise and real-world responses.  Shared systems are used 
daily to provide multi-agency communications.  The City of Atlanta and Fulton County operate separate 800 
megahertz (MHz) infrastructure but share system keys.  The Atlanta mobile gateway used in the exercise was 
pre-programmed, which evaluators noted as a best practice.  Shared channels in the UA are reserved for 
situations requiring the coordination of multiple public safety agencies and were successfully used during the 
TICP validation exercise.  The exercise included state and federal agencies—when the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation’s equipment failed, the Atlanta UA provided the Bureau with a cached radio to support 
communications. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Atlanta UA has 26 separate radio systems that cover 9 counties, which is inclusive of the metropolitan Atlanta area.  
The UA also relies on NEXTEL and SouthernLINC Enhanced Special Mobile Radio commercial systems to support 
wireless voice and data communications.  The City of Atlanta and Fulton County operate separate 800 MHz radio 
systems but share system keys enabling access by city and county representatives.  Atlanta operates a Motorola 800 
MHz SMARTNET™ Citywide Radio System supporting 18 separate local, state, and federal agencies.  Regional 
interoperability is provided by the Motorola P25-compliant, 800 MHz ASTRO 25 system.  The system is used 
exclusively to support interoperability among regional first responders.  The Atlanta UA is reaching beyond its 
immediate jurisdictional footprint to embrace all nine counties that make up the metropolitan Atlanta All Hazard Fulton 
County Emergency Services (Area 7) Council footprint.  It is the intent of UA planners to leverage the new systems and 
the current UA P25, Motorola ASTRO 25 800 MHz system to form the most effective interoperable communication 
strategy.  This may include connecting new systems to the UA switch or leveraging/implementing other technology 
solutions to achieve regional interoperable communications.

The Public Safety Oversight Committee (PSOC), established in 2002, provides governance on 
communications issues.  The PSOC has become more formalized with an established charter in the last year 
and a half as a result of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) mandate, and most agencies 
are now participating in the process.  The UA has informal agreements in practice that facilitate 
communications interoperability.  A memoranda of agreement has been drafted for first responders, and all 
participating agencies have agreed to sign the agreement except for Honolulu law enforcement.  
Additionally, regional memoranda of agreements (including an agreement with State Health) remain 
informal.  The Honolulu UA has not developed a regional interoperability strategic plan, but is in the process 
of developing a plan.  Local leaders have taken rapid steps to improve their interoperability through a series 
of communications tabletops.  Although funding is still largely distributed for agency needs, Honolulu’s 
long-term planning through the 5-year capital plan and the fiscal coordination laid out in the TICP have set 
the stage for regionally coordinated improvements.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Work with the State Department of Health to establish an interoperability agreement with City of 
Honolulu for emergency medical services 
• 
Clarify that published and active agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) are in place among all 
necessary first responders and work to get any needed agreements implemented 
• 
Continue to develop the strategic plan that has already been initiated 
• 
Attempt to align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that a regional strategy has been 
established; also apply this regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) interoperability funding 
and planning 
• 
Establish interoperability SOPs and associated training as a priority across the area

The Honolulu UA achieved its first regionwide communications SOPs through the development of the TICP.  
The UA did not have policies and procedures in place before the development of the TICP.  The new plan 
has been distributed to all agencies (e.g., distributed to dispatch centers and through TICP Implementation 
Workshop, available with gateways) and has been exercised.  Officials indicated that they plan to build on 
this collaborative TICP effort to address communications with the surrounding islands.  The National 
Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) was mandated more than 1 year ago 
through the adoption of a city resolution, and training is being implemented to fully familiarize all personnel.

Through the cooperation fostered by the TICP process, the Honolulu UA has increasingly used interoperable 
communications solutions (e.g., radio cache, shared channels, gateways, shared systems).  Honolulu Police 
and Fire now operate on a shared system and have implemented shared talk groups that are frequently used.  
The TICP validation exercise exposed some load issues with their shared system, as well as problems with 
gateways critical to multi-agency communications (especially with state and federal agencies) on the island.  
Despite the minor problems, local first responders were able to interoperate via City of Honolulu’s shared 
system. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Train regional communications specialists in interoperability solution capabilities (e.g., tactical use of 
talk groups) to more effectively communicate during an incident 
• 
Increase the frequency of use of the mobile and fixed gateways available to responders 
• 
Seek opportunities to incorporate mobile and fixed gateways through regular tests, planned events, and 
exercises 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Technology Overview    
The Honolulu UA’s first responders operate on a 800 megahertz (MHz) M/A-COM Enhanced Digital Access 
Communications System (EDACS™) trunked radio system.  Several public safety agencies in the UA use this system, 
including Honolulu Police Department, Honolulu Fire Department, Emergency Services Department, Department of 
Information Technology, Oahu Civil Defense Agency, and Department of Transportation Services.  However, 
interoperability is needed with other shared systems, including the ultra high frequency (UHF) system that supports the 
State Department of Health, hospitals, medical centers, and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG); the UHF Pacific Mobile 
Emergency Radio System (PACMERS) supporting Department of Defense (DoD) agencies; and two very high 
frequency (VHF) systems supporting federal and state agencies.  Interoperable communications is provided through 
shared and command-level talk groups.  City and state agencies also maintain five mobile and two fixed ACU-1000 
gateway systems.  Voice interoperability between the city and county of Honolulu (800 MHz) and state and federal 
agencies (UHF and VHF High Band) is primarily provided through these gateway solutions and/or a shared VHF 
channel.  Interoperability between city response agencies and the USCG is provided via a gateway on a Free Space 
Optic link and through a dedicated USCG talk group on the City's 800 MHz EDACS shared system.  Interoperability 
among PACMERS users and the city and county of Honolulu is provided through two fixed gateway solutions.

Through the UA Working Group, the UA is starting to take steps necessary to address long-standing technical and 
operational issues among public safety organizations in the Chicago UA.  While interoperability is presently a top 
priority in the UA and is being addressed, the area has a great deal of historical challenges to overcome.  As reported in 
the overview of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), “[t]he City of Chicago and Cook County for 
decades have been developing very extensive and expensive legacy radio communications systems independently, and 
without considering the concept of interoperable communications.”  Governance for communications within the 
Chicago UA has been assigned to a Communications Subcommittee.  The group has not been formalized and initially 
was divided between a City of Chicago Working Group and a Cook County Working Group.  The TICP Peer Review 
recommended that the group “strongly consider merging the multiple working groups into one governance organization 
or clarifying how issues of disagreement between Cook County and Chicago working groups are/will be addressed.”  
Agreements are largely informal, and the city’s process for developing and confirming the agreements differs from the 
process in Cook County.  Efforts have begun to develop a strategic plan for the UA; however, this effort is at an early 
stage and will require coordination between the city and county to be successful.  A regional approach to
