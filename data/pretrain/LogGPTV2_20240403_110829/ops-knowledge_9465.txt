User: I have a web service to which users upload python scripts that are run on a server. Those scripts process files that are on the server and I want them to be able to see only a certain hierarchy of the server's filesystem (best: a temporary folder on which I copy the files I want processed and the scripts).
The server will ultimately be a linux based one but if a solution is also possible on Windows it would be nice to know how.
What I though of is creating a user with restricted access to folders of the FS - ultimately only the folder containing the scripts and files - and launch the python interpreter using this user.
Can someone give me a better alternative? as relying only on this makes me feel insecure, I would like a real sandboxing or virtual FS feature where I could run safely untrusted code.
Assistant: You are probably best to use a virtual machine like VirtualBox or VMware (perhaps even creating one per user/session).  
That will allow you some control over other resources such as memory and network as well as disk
The only python that I know of that has such features built in is the one on Google App Engine. That may be a workable alternative for you too.
