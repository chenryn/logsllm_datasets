## Abstract
Data is a key driver of the modern economy and AI/machine learning. However, much of this data is sensitive, and its handling presents unprecedented challenges for both individuals and businesses. These challenges are likely to intensify as we progress further into the digital era.

In this talk, I will discuss the technologies essential for responsible data use, including secure computing, differential privacy, federated learning, and blockchain for data rights. I will also explore how to integrate privacy-preserving computing technologies and blockchain to build a platform for a responsible data economy. This platform aims to maximize social welfare and economic efficiency while protecting users' data rights and ensuring fair distribution of the value generated from data.

Additionally, I will cover new paradigms enabled by this approach, such as decentralized data science and data DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). I will also discuss new frameworks for data valuation.
