ABSTRACT 
Data is a key driver of modern economy and AI/machine learning, 
however, a lot of this data is sensitive and handling the sensitive 
data has caused unprecedented challenges for both individuals and 
businesses. These challenges will only get more severe as we move 
forward in the digital era. In this talk, I will talk about technologies 
needed  for  responsible  data  use  including  secure  computing, 
differential  privacy,  federated  learning,  as  well  as  blockchain 
technologies  for  data  rights,  and  how  to  combine  privacy 
computing technologies and blockchain to building a platform for 
a responsible data economy, to enable more responsible use of data 
that  maximizes  social  welfare  &  economic  efficiency  while 
protecting  users’  data  rights  and  enable  fair  distribution  of  value 
created  from  data. I  will  also  talk  about  new  paradigms  that  this 
approach  enables  including  decentralized  data  science  and  data 
DAO. I will also discuss new frameworks on data valuation.
