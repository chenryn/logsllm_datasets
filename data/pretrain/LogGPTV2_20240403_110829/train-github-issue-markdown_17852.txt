I attempted to upgrade my cluster using the `hack/dev-build-and-push.sh` script, but encountered a failure due to repeated error messages. The errors are as follows:

```
hack/../cluster/../cluster/../cluster/gce/../../cluster/common.sh: line 283: KUBE_TAR_URL: unbound variable
Failure trying to curl release .sha1
```

This error message repeats multiple times, indicating that the `KUBE_TAR_URL` variable is not set, and the script is unable to download the release `.sha1` file.

To resolve this issue, you may need to ensure that the `KUBE_TAR_URL` variable is correctly defined in your environment or in the relevant configuration files. Additionally, check if there are any network issues that might be preventing the `curl` command from successfully retrieving the `.sha1` file.
