process that transforms inputs into outputs. An input is a resource available
to production. Generally, the producers that own the production processes
provide inputs to these processes. Service processes are production processes
in which also consumers provide or make available input resources (either
themselves or information they have or their property). An output is a result
of production. Consumers select outputs from production processes to satisfy
2.3 Unified Services Theory 23
their needs. The extraction of value, which is the satisfaction of consumers’
needs, is performed in consumption processes. A concept not explicitly shown
but present in the chain of relations in the concept map is that of consumer-
producer interaction, which is bidirectional. Consumers influence producers
by providing production inputs and producers influence consumers by acting
on the consumer inputs.

2.3.3 Service Process Versus Service as Process
JoiningtheconceptmapsoftheService-DominantLogicandtheUnifiedSer-
vices Theory is not an easy operation, given their fundamentally di↵erent
view of service. While service is defined as a process in the Service-Dominant
Logic, it is not the same as the service process as intended by the Unified
Services Theory which employs a more restricted meaning and distinguishes
betweenserviceandnon-servicesituations(suchdistinctionwouldbenonsense
in Service-Dominant Logic). While service in the Service-Dominant Logic re-
quires co-creation between the producer/provider and consumer/beneficiary,
the acts of the service provider (or producer) and beneficiary (or consumer)
might overlap completely or partially but also be completely independent in
space and time; hence, the resource integration and resulting value capture
by the beneficiary might happen long after and in a di↵erent location than
the provider’s activities. This scenario is consistent with what happens in
the consumption process of the Unified Services Theory where the consumer
may extract value from outputs of non-service production processes without
24 2 Conceptual Frameworks
any interaction with the producer. However, to qualify as a service process,
the production process needs consumer inputs, which implies some degree
of overlap in time and space between producer and consumer activities. As
noted in [18], this interaction is, however, not as restrictive as requiring co-
production as the provision of the consumer’s labor is only one possible type
of consumer input into the production process.
2.3.4 From Service Process to Service Exchange
The notion of value as satisfyingneeds in the Unified Services Theory is close
tothenotionofvalue-in-useintheService-DominantLogic,hence,valueseems
acommonconceptinbothmaps.Alsoinboththeoriesitistheconsumer/ben-
eficiary that determines and captures the value. The resource integration in
the Service-Dominant Logic and the value extraction to satisfy needs in the
Unified Services Theory are, therefore, similar. To integrate both concept
maps, value can, therefore, be used an anchor point. Further we see that con-
sumer and producer in the Unified Services Theory are specializations (and
actuallyroles)ofactorintheService-DominantLogic.TheinputsintheUni-
fied Services Theory are resources in the Service-Dominant Logic.
As the purpose of the conceptual model we develop in this chapter is the

thedi↵erencesbetweenboththeories,theintegratedconceptmapshouldallow
for multiple interpretations of concepts to co-exist. Hence, we include in the
concept map of Fig. 2.3 concepts from the Service-Dominant Logic to extend
the concept map for the Unified Services Theory (Fig. 2.2), without claiming
to have integrated the theories themselves.
Additions from the Service-Dominant Logic are the concepts of service,
value co-creation and value proposition (though the latter concept is a com-
ponent of the Unified Services Theory concept of business process, not shown
here). Also, the distinction between operant and operand resources is added,

service is given in Sect. 2.5, where we introduce the Resource-Service-System

2.4 Work System Metamodel
The Work system metamodel [4] is an extension of the Work System The-
ory [1]. The Work System Theory defines a work system as a “system in

which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and ac-
tivities)usinginformation,technology,andotherresourcestoproducespecific

Services are defined as acts performed to produce outcomes for the benefit of
others.TheWorkSystemTheoryencompassesadescriptiveframeworkcalled
Work System Framework that can be used to describe and analyze work sys-
tems. Given that service systems are work systems and most work systems
are service systems (except those work systems not directed at others), the
Work System Framework can be used to describe service systems. While the
WorkSystemFrameworkisintendedtoprovidesummary-leveldescriptionsof
work systems, the Work system metamodel expresses a more detailed opera-
tionalviewonworksystems.Intheremainderwewillnotuseallthesedetails
(e.g., di↵erent types of technological, informational, and other resources used
in service systems), but focus our discussion on concepts that might provide
for interesting new additions to our current concept base (as in Fig. 2.3).
2.4.1 Work System Metamodel Concepts
The main concepts of interest of the Work system metamodel are shown in
Fig. 2.4. A service system is a work system in which work is performed for
26 2 Conceptual Frameworks
the benefit of internal or external customers to the enterprise that o↵ers the
service. The benefits for an internal customer are other than for performing
work activities within the service system itself. The service system contains
service system activities that use resources and produce products/services.
Resources can be technological entities, informational entities, (human) par-
ticipants or other resources. The term product/service refers to a bundle of
tangibleand/orintangibleactsandoutcomesthatmaybemoregoods-likeor
more services-like. Note that Work System Theory recognizes the traditional
distinction between goods and services but does not consider it important
to understand service systems. Service system activities are performed by
actor roles which can be performed by automated agents (which is a tech-
nological entity and a totally automated service system on its own right),
non-customer participants (e.g., an employee of the enterprise) or customer
participants (i.e.,incaseofco-production).Products/servicesmaybeusedas
resourcesforotheractivitieswithinthesameservicesystem,however,atleast
oneproduct/serviceproducedbyanactivityoftheservicesystemcontributes
to a product/service to the customer, meaning physical things, information,
acts and/or outcomes used or received by a customer work system in which
they facilitate the creation of value for the customer.

2.4.2 From Service Process to Service System
Comparing the Work system metamodel with the Unified Services theory, we
see that the distinction between provider service system and customer work
system is similar to that of production process and consumption process in
2.4 Work System Metamodel 27
the Unified Services Theory. Though not shown in Fig. 2.4, the Work sys-
tem metamodel includes the concept of (business) process when two or more
service system activities “are su ciently interrelated and sequential enough
to be considered a process” [4]. Hence, the production and consumption pro-
cessarepartoftheprovider,respectivelycustomerworksystemsandcontain
themselves work system activities. A work system perspective, thus, allows
describing Unified Services Theory processes in more detail, for instance by
showing that the outputs of production process activities might be used as
inputs for other activities within the same or di↵erent production process
(belonging to the same provider work system), and, thus, not all outputs are
directed at internal or external customers. Likewise, it can also show the re-
sources of di↵erent kinds that are used as inputs in individual production
process activities, whereas the Unified Services Theory focuses on di↵erent
kinds of consumer inputs into the overall service process.
2.4.3 Reconciling Value Co-Creation Definitions
The Work system metamodel is also interesting as it can help bridging the
UnifiedServicesTheoryandtheService-DominantLogic.Theservicebrought
about by the provider service system does not directly create value for the
customer, but “facilitates” value creation [7], which is done in the customer
worksystem.Theproduct/serviceforcustomeris,thus,similartotheoutput
of production processes that is selected for consumption processes in which
value is extracted to satisfy consumer needs. Although the customer always
has certain responsibilities, customer participation in service system activi-
ties (in the sense of co-production) is optional, so the absence of a distinction
betweenservicesystems(orserviceproductionprocessesasintheUnifiedSer-
vicesTheory)and“non-service”systems(ornon-serviceproductionprocesses
as in the Unified Services Theory) is similar to the Service-Dominant Logic
where all economic activity is service (i.e., Foundational Premise FP5). Also,
thedefinition ofservice isvery similartothat ofthe ServiceDominant Logic.
An apparent di↵erence with the Service-Dominant Logic is the view of
valueco-creationwhichisoptionalintheWorksystemmetamodelbutstrictly
required for service in the Service-Dominant Logic. The di↵erence is actually
more a di↵erence in definition as the value creation in the customer work
system based on the products/services of the provider service system is what
resource integrators (FP9) do and what qualifies as value co-creation in the
Service-Dominant Logic. The Work system metamodel employs a more re-
strictive notion of value co-creation as customer work system activities that
coincideintimeandlocationwithproviderservicesystemactivities,implying
that value co-creation is a more narrow form of co-production. More impor-
tant is that the service system produces a “service as a process” (as in the
Service-Dominant Logic), which facilitates value creation by customers/con-
sumers (as in the Unified Services Theory).
28 2 Conceptual Frameworks
The concept map in Fig. 2.5 shows how the Work system metamodel
can be linked to both the Unified Services Theory and the Service-Dominant
Logic. The product/service for customer is equated with the output that the
consumer selects for the consumption process in the Unified Services Theory.
Hence, the value for customer created by the customer work system is the
valuethatisextractedintheconsumptionprocessperformedbytheconsumer.
The link with the Service-Dominant Logic is that service is performed by the
service system.

2.5 Resource-Service-System model 29
2.5 Resource-Service-System model
The Resource-Service-System model [15, 14] interprets the Resource-Event-
Agent (REA) model of economic exchange [5] according to the Service-
DominantLogic.InREA,economicexchangeresultsfromtheeconomicrecip-
rocalactions(calledeconomicevents)ofindependententities(calledeconomic
agents) that provide each other the resources that they control (called eco-
nomic resources).
2.5.1 Resource-Service-System Model Concepts
Rooted in Accounting, REA employs the traditional economic classification
of products as goods and services, hence, services are a type of resource ex-
changed between economic agents. This means that a service resource (e.g.,
a consulting service) and the event that transfers this resource from a pro-
viding agent to a receiving agent (e.g., the contracting and executing of the
consultingservice)areexplicitlydistinguished,whereassuchdistinctionisnot
recognized in the Service-Dominant Logic (i.e., the consulting process is the
service).
TheResource-Service-Systemmodel,therefore,replacestheREAnotionof
economic resource by the Service-Dominant Logic notion of operant/operand
resource (seetheconceptmapinFig.2.6),theREAnotionofeconomicevent
by the Service-Dominant Logic notion of service (as operant resources acting
upon operand resources (e.g., as service target) or with operand resources
(e.g., as tools or appliances)), and the REA notion of economic agent by that
of service system entity. The latter concept is inspired by systems thinking
in Service Science [12], where service systems are seen as supra-systems com-
posed of sub-systems (i.e., service system entities) that improve their state
(and, hence, the state of the supra-system) through service exchange.
As dynamic configurations of resources, service system entities possess
the means to engage in service exchanges with other service system enti-
ties. Based on the REA axiom of economic reciprocity in economic exchange,
alsodescribedasthedualityofeconomicevents,theResource-Service-System
model posits that service exchange is the reification of the dual relationship
between economic reciprocal events as a series of actions and interactions un-
dertaken by service system entities. Fig. 2.6 shows that a service exchange is
composed of service system interactions which are described by an interac-
tion episode [11]. Such an interaction episode represents a series of activities,
separatelyorjointlyperformedbytheservicesystementities,astheyoccurin
reality and, thus, lead to a certain outcome or interaction episode type. The
