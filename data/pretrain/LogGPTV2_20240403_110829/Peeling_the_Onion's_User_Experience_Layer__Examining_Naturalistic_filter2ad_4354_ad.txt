low convenience features at lower anonymity levels.
Perhaps a reasonable solution is allowing convenience fea-
tures when the Tor Browser is set for the lowest level of
security, i.e., the security slider setting is set to ‘Standard.’
This would allow users to maintain many of the familiar
browsing conveniences while still allowing those who require
stronger protections to disable the features easily by raising
the security level via the slider settings. Since the security
slider is currently set to ‘Standard’ by default, an alterna-
tive implementation could add another setting level that
enables convenience features without affecting the currently
implemented settings.
Solution: Provide the ability to specify threats of rel-
evance to the user. The security slider settings within the
Tor Browser already address various threat models. However,
most of the differences among the different settings of the
slider pertain to user tracking and identification mechanisms
and capabilities of remote adversaries. The security slider
functionality could be extended to consider other adversaries,
such as those with physical access to the user’s computer.
In addition to being controlled via the security slider, con-
venience features could be selectively enabled based on user
input regarding threats and use cases of importance. For
instance, at the time of installation, the Tor Browser could
launch a ‘threat selection dialog’ that allows the user to
specify the threat(s) from which protection is desired, e.g.,
mass surveillance, censorship, advertiser profiling, etc. Based
on user selections, and potentially other relevant aspects,
such as country of use, features within the browser could be
activated to achieve an optimal balance between convenience
and privacy. Research is needed to determine the potential
anonymity impact of the convenience features and the criteria
for achieving the desired balance between convenience and
privacy. Further, users should be able to invoke the threat
selection dialog as needed in order to account for changes in
needs and contexts.
5.3 Differential Treatment
A notable portion of the difficulties faced by Tor users are
not technical, but political. Many Web site operators as
well as powerful corporate and government entities block
connections from the Tor network entirely. Moreover, it is not
straightforward to determine who is blocking Tor traffic and
why. Unless users are able to connect via an unpublished Tor
exit node or use a proxy after the Tor exit node, it is difficult
to avoid such blocks. Currently, the best countermeasure
is working with Web site operators and security software
vendors to create exceptions for Tor. However, such a process
could be time and resource consuming, especially for a small
entity like the Tor project.
Solution: Crowdsource the reporting of differential
treatment of Tor traffic. It might be expedient to detect
and report Tor traffic blocks by distributing the effort among
Tor users via crowdsourcing techniques. For instance, the
Tor Browser could include a ‘Report connection problem’
button that allows users to flag offending resources, thus
facilitating monitoring and prioritization based on reporting
frequency and problem severity. The crowd could perhaps
also be leveraged to monitor and maintain the database of
reports. Such reporting mechanisms could be extended to
provide lightweight features for collecting and processing
voluntary and anonymous user feedback regarding UX issues
in general.
Solution: Explore alternative ways to deliver blocked
content. When a resource cannot be reached via the Tor
Browser, it may still be possible to access the content through
the use of services that archive or cache Internet content.
For instance, the Tor Browser could incorporate mecha-
nisms that allow searching for content on Internet archives
such as the Wayback Machine [41] and within search engine
caches, thus facilitating access to the content without sacri-
ficing anonymity by accessing the blocked content in another
browser.
5.4 Geolocation
Many Web sites customize content delivery based on the
location determined by the user’s IP address. For instance,
such customization is utilized to set the appropriate language,
display prices in the local currency, enforce intellectual prop-
erty restrictions, etc. If the Tor Browser routes a user’s traffic
through an exit node in a country other than where the user
is located, the delivered content ends up being wrongly cus-
tomized from the user’s point of view. Currently, specifying
the desired country for exit nodes requires modifying the Tor
run-time configuration file, torrc. This file can be compli-
cated to handle and difficult to edit correctly, especially for
non-experts.
Solution: Allow easy specification of desired exit
node location. The ability to switch the preferred location
of the exit node could be included within the set of settings
that can be adjusted within the Tor Browser’s graphical user
interface. Such a feature must be accompanied by clear warn-
ings that choosing to limit exit nodes to a specific country
reduces the number of potential circuits, thus reducing the
level of anonymity. The ability to set exit node location could
be disabled at higher security levels as indicated by the secu-
rity slider settings or based on the threats and adversaries
selected by the user in the threat selection dialog mentioned
above.
5.5 Operational Messaging
Novices and non-experts lack sophisticated operational un-
derstanding of Tor and anonymity compromising mecha-
nisms [13]. As a result, it is important that the UX provide
operational transparency and facilitate user learning. How-
ever, our participants found messaging within the Tor Browser
to be inadequate and inaccessible, leading to confusion, frus-
tration, and lack of trust.
Solution: Deliver contextually relevant information
during user sessions. Most users lack the time or the pa-
tience to read long manuals or view tutorials. However, short
messages relevant to the user’s context delivered appropri-
ately during use could be an effective means of communica-
tion, as demonstrated by the engagement of our participants
with warnings related to screen maximization and HTML5 can-
vas data extraction and the visualization related to traffic
routing. Such mechanisms could be used for further text
messages and visual indicators that help users relate the UX
with operational detail. Useful information snippets could
also be made available when the Tor Browser is first launched
as well as on the about:tor and https://check.torproject.org
pages. The UX for the delivery of such messages should be
carefully designed to avoid unduly interrupting or distracting
the user.
Solution: Craft errors, warnings, and other user
communication in language accessible to non-experts.
Information provided to users is useful only if they can un-
derstand it and take appropriate action. Therefore, messages
should be crafted to avoid jargon and ensure understanding
without requiring in-depth technical knowledge. To this end,
evaluating message text via user studies could help improve
its readability for a general audience.
6 LIMITATIONS
A few limitations must be kept in mind when considering
the generalizability of these findings. Our sample is small
and homogenous in terms of age, education, and cultural
background. Moreover, the research was carried out in the
United States where the nature of threats to civil liberties
is different from that encountered in other places across the
world. Further research is needed to uncover additional UX
aspects that might be salient in other types of populations.
Most of our participants were not familiar with Tor prior
to the study, thus representing novice and non-expert users.
While UX considerations for experts may be somewhat differ-
ent, increasing Tor adoption and use requires a greater focus
on novices and non-experts who constitute the majority of
the population.
One participant mentioned changing browsing activities
during the study because of the monitoring of browser state
transitions by our script. In contrast, it is possible that
the privacy protection of Tor led our participants to access
resources that they might not otherwise have sought in the
course of routine “non-private” browsing. Additionally, given
the nature of our study, participants may have been more
tolerant of errors than they would be in a typical browsing
session. Although such deviations from normal browsing
practices may have slightly reduced the naturalistic aspect
of our data, we note that only one participant reported
engaging in browsing behavior during the study that differed
from typical online practices.
Since our browser monitoring script relied on various heuris-
tics to determine browser state transitions, it was prone to
the occasional false positives that led to unnecessary pre-
sentation of questionnaires, evoking pop-up fatigue in some
participants. Similarly, it is possible that the script missed
some browser transitions and failed to present a question-
naire even when warranted, thus missing the opportunity
for collecting data. Moreover, the script covered only tra-
ditional desktop or laptop computers, missing coverage of
browsing activities from mobile devices, such as smartphones
and tablets, which are increasingly becoming the dominant
mode of online access for a large proportion of the popu-
lation. A few participants reported that the study did not
capture the full extent of their Web use because they utilized
their mobile devices for most of their Web browsing activities
during the study period. As Web access via mobile devices
continues to increase at a rapid pace, our study would need
to be replicated in order to capture UX problems specific to
Tor based mobile applications.
Additional quantitative data and finer grained informa-
tion could potentially have shed more light on some of the
issues we discovered. For instance, an in-depth analysis of
broken functionality issues was infeasible due to the limited
information available in participant self-reports. A potential
solution could combine self-reports with information collec-
tion within the Tor Browser on relevant aspects such as load
times, blocked page elements, etc. It is difficult, if not impos-
sible, to collect such data privately, thus leading to a tension
between the goals of the research and the Tor Browser.
7 FUTURE WORK
Our findings point to several opportunities for future UX
research involving the Tor Browser and the Tor anonymity
network. Section 5 outlines a number of suggestions for im-
proving the Tor Browser UX. The effectiveness of these sug-
gestions needs to be validated through empirical studies
with Tor users, preferably in naturalistic settings. Many ad-
vanced aspects of Tor use, such as setting up relays, accessing
or running Onion services, etc., were not examined in our
study. Evaluating and improving the UX of these aspects
could further help Tor become more accessible to the general
population. Such investigations could also tackle specialized
uses targeted at specific populations and use cases, such as
SecureDrop for journalists and their sources.
Future work could also address some of the limitations
of our study outlined in Section 6. For instance, a mecha-
nism that allows private collection of Tor Browser teleme-
try to augment user self-reports can be particularly useful.
Such browser-collected information could include load times,
blocked page elements, JavaScript profiling, and URLs per-
taining to resources that lead to UX problems. Similarly, our
study could be replicated to cover other populations, such as
experts or users in different political climates, to surface UX
issues that our sample may not have encountered.
8 CONCLUSION
Increasing surveillance of online activities by corporate and
state actors has led to growing adoption of anonymity-preserving
tools such as Tor. As Tor expands to a mainstream user base
composed of novices and non-experts, the UX becomes an
increasingly important factor for facilitating adoption and
continued use. Our mixed-methods study is an important
first step in studying the Tor Browser UX in a naturalistic
setting. Parts of our approach could be deployed to collect
anonymous user input at scale. We offer a number of ac-
tionable suggestions to mitigate the various UX challenges
uncovered by our study. Next steps involve implementing
the proposed solutions and evaluating their effectiveness in
improving the Tor Browser UX for routine use by the general
population.
