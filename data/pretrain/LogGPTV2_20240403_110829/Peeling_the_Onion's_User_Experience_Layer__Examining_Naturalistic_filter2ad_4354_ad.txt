### Low Convenience Features at Lower Anonymity Levels

Perhaps a reasonable solution is to allow convenience features when the Tor Browser is set to the lowest level of security, i.e., when the security slider is set to 'Standard.' This approach would enable users to maintain many of the familiar browsing conveniences while still allowing those who require stronger protections to easily disable these features by raising the security level via the slider settings. Since the security slider is currently set to 'Standard' by default, an alternative implementation could introduce an additional setting level that enables convenience features without altering the existing settings.

### Solution: User-Specified Threat Models

The security slider settings within the Tor Browser already address various threat models. However, most of the differences among the different slider settings pertain to user tracking and identification mechanisms, as well as the capabilities of remote adversaries. The functionality of the security slider could be extended to consider other types of adversaries, such as those with physical access to the userâ€™s computer. In addition to being controlled via the security slider, convenience features could be selectively enabled based on user input regarding relevant threats and use cases.

For instance, during the installation process, the Tor Browser could launch a 'threat selection dialog' that allows the user to specify the types of threats from which they seek protection, such as mass surveillance, censorship, or advertiser profiling. Based on the user's selections and potentially other relevant factors, such as the country of use, the browser could activate specific features to achieve an optimal balance between convenience and privacy. Research is needed to determine the potential anonymity impact of these convenience features and to establish criteria for achieving the desired balance. Users should also be able to invoke the threat selection dialog as needed to account for changes in their needs and contexts.

### 5.3 Differential Treatment

A significant portion of the difficulties faced by Tor users are not technical but political. Many website operators, as well as powerful corporate and government entities, block connections from the Tor network. Moreover, it is often challenging to determine who is blocking Tor traffic and why. Unless users can connect via an unpublished Tor exit node or use a proxy after the Tor exit node, it is difficult to avoid such blocks. Currently, the best countermeasure is working with website operators and security software vendors to create exceptions for Tor. However, this process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for a small entity like the Tor project.

### Solution: Crowdsourced Reporting of Tor Traffic Blocks

It might be expedient to detect and report Tor traffic blocks by distributing the effort among Tor users through crowdsourcing techniques. For example, the Tor Browser could include a 'Report connection problem' button that allows users to flag offending resources, facilitating monitoring and prioritization based on reporting frequency and problem severity. The crowd could also be leveraged to monitor and maintain the database of reports. Such reporting mechanisms could be extended to provide lightweight features for collecting and processing voluntary and anonymous user feedback regarding general UX issues.

### Solution: Alternative Content Delivery

When a resource cannot be reached via the Tor Browser, it may still be possible to access the content through services that archive or cache Internet content. For instance, the Tor Browser could incorporate mechanisms that allow searching for content on Internet archives such as the Wayback Machine and within search engine caches, thus facilitating access to the content without sacrificing anonymity by accessing the blocked content in another browser.

### 5.4 Geolocation

Many websites customize content delivery based on the user's IP address, such as setting the appropriate language, displaying prices in the local currency, or enforcing intellectual property restrictions. If the Tor Browser routes a user's traffic through an exit node in a different country, the delivered content may be incorrectly customized from the user's perspective. Currently, specifying the desired country for exit nodes requires modifying the Tor run-time configuration file, `torrc`, which can be complicated and difficult to edit, especially for non-experts.

### Solution: Easy Specification of Desired Exit Node Location

The ability to switch the preferred location of the exit node could be included within the set of settings that can be adjusted via the Tor Browser's graphical user interface. This feature must be accompanied by clear warnings that limiting exit nodes to a specific country reduces the number of potential circuits, thereby reducing the level of anonymity. The ability to set exit node location could be disabled at higher security levels, as indicated by the security slider settings or based on the threats and adversaries selected by the user in the threat selection dialog mentioned above.

### 5.5 Operational Messaging

Novices and non-experts lack sophisticated operational understanding of Tor and anonymity-compromising mechanisms. As a result, it is crucial that the UX provides operational transparency and facilitates user learning. However, our participants found messaging within the Tor Browser to be inadequate and inaccessible, leading to confusion, frustration, and a lack of trust.

### Solution: Contextually Relevant Information During User Sessions

Most users do not have the time or patience to read long manuals or view tutorials. However, short, contextually relevant messages delivered appropriately during use could be an effective means of communication, as demonstrated by the engagement of our participants with warnings related to screen maximization and HTML5 canvas data extraction. Such mechanisms could be used for further text messages and visual indicators that help users relate the UX to operational details. Useful information snippets could also be made available when the Tor Browser is first launched, as well as on the `about:tor` and `https://check.torproject.org` pages. The UX for delivering such messages should be carefully designed to avoid unduly interrupting or distracting the user.

### Solution: Accessible Language for Errors, Warnings, and Other User Communication

Information provided to users is only useful if they can understand it and take appropriate action. Therefore, messages should be crafted to avoid jargon and ensure understanding without requiring in-depth technical knowledge. To this end, evaluating message text via user studies could help improve its readability for a general audience.

### 6. Limitations

Several limitations must be considered when generalizing these findings. Our sample is small and homogeneous in terms of age, education, and cultural background. Additionally, the research was conducted in the United States, where the nature of threats to civil liberties differs from other parts of the world. Further research is needed to uncover additional UX aspects that might be salient in other populations. Most of our participants were not familiar with Tor prior to the study, representing novice and non-expert users. While UX considerations for experts may differ, increasing Tor adoption and use requires a greater focus on novices and non-experts, who constitute the majority of the population.

One participant mentioned changing browsing activities during the study due to the monitoring of browser state transitions by our script. Conversely, the privacy protection of Tor may have led some participants to access resources they might not otherwise have sought during routine "non-private" browsing. Additionally, given the nature of our study, participants may have been more tolerant of errors than they would be in a typical browsing session. Although such deviations from normal browsing practices may have slightly reduced the naturalistic aspect of our data, we note that only one participant reported engaging in browsing behavior during the study that differed from typical online practices.

Since our browser monitoring script relied on various heuristics to determine browser state transitions, it was prone to occasional false positives, leading to unnecessary presentation of questionnaires and evoking pop-up fatigue in some participants. Similarly, the script may have missed some browser transitions and failed to present a questionnaire even when warranted, thus missing the opportunity to collect data. Moreover, the script covered only traditional desktop or laptop computers, missing coverage of browsing activities from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, which are increasingly becoming the dominant mode of online access for a large proportion of the population. A few participants reported that the study did not capture the full extent of their web use because they utilized their mobile devices for most of their web browsing activities during the study period. As web access via mobile devices continues to increase, our study would need to be replicated to capture UX problems specific to Tor-based mobile applications.

Additional quantitative data and finer-grained information could potentially shed more light on some of the issues we discovered. For instance, an in-depth analysis of broken functionality issues was infeasible due to the limited information available in participant self-reports. A potential solution could combine self-reports with information collection within the Tor Browser on relevant aspects such as load times, blocked page elements, etc. It is difficult, if not impossible, to collect such data privately, leading to a tension between the goals of the research and the Tor Browser.

### 7. Future Work

Our findings point to several opportunities for future UX research involving the Tor Browser and the Tor anonymity network. Section 5 outlines several suggestions for improving the Tor Browser UX. The effectiveness of these suggestions needs to be validated through empirical studies with Tor users, preferably in naturalistic settings. Many advanced aspects of Tor use, such as setting up relays, accessing or running Onion services, etc., were not examined in our study. Evaluating and improving the UX of these aspects could further help Tor become more accessible to the general population. Such investigations could also tackle specialized uses targeted at specific populations and use cases, such as SecureDrop for journalists and their sources.

Future work could also address some of the limitations of our study outlined in Section 6. For instance, a mechanism that allows private collection of Tor Browser telemetry to augment user self-reports can be particularly useful. Such browser-collected information could include load times, blocked page elements, JavaScript profiling, and URLs pertaining to resources that lead to UX problems. Similarly, our study could be replicated to cover other populations, such as experts or users in different political climates, to surface UX issues that our sample may not have encountered.

### 8. Conclusion

Increasing surveillance of online activities by corporate and state actors has led to growing adoption of anonymity-preserving tools such as Tor. As Tor expands to a mainstream user base composed of novices and non-experts, the UX becomes an increasingly important factor for facilitating adoption and continued use. Our mixed-methods study is an important first step in studying the Tor Browser UX in a naturalistic setting. Parts of our approach could be deployed to collect anonymous user input at scale. We offer several actionable suggestions to mitigate the various UX challenges uncovered by our study. Next steps involve implementing the proposed solutions and evaluating their effectiveness in improving the Tor Browser UX for routine use by the general population.
