Abstract
The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made it inevitable that their pertinence to digital
forensic investigations will increase into the foreseeable future. These devices produced by various vendors often posses
limited standard interfaces for communication, such as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces. Meanwhile, with
an increasing mainstream focus on the security and privacy of user data, built-in encryption is becoming commonplace in
consumer-level computing devices, and IoT devices are no exception. Under these circumstances, a signiﬁcant challenge
is presented to digital forensic investigations where data from IoT devices needs to be analysed.
This work explores the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis literature for the purpose of assisting digital
forensic investigations on IoT devices. EM side-channel analysis is a technique where unintentional electromagnetic
emissions are used for eavesdropping on the operations and data handling of computing devices. The non-intrusive
nature of EM side-channel approaches makes it a viable option to assist digital forensic investigations as these attacks
require, and must result in, no modiﬁcation to the target device. The literature on various EM side-channel analysis
attack techniques are discussed – selected on the basis of their applicability in IoT device investigation scenarios. The
insight gained from the background study is used to identify promising future applications of the technique for digital
forensic analysis on IoT devices – potentially progressing a wide variety of currently hindered digital investigations.

1. Introduction
Digital forensics is the ﬁeld where legal investigations
are assisted by analysing digital sources of evidence.
In
contrast, cybersecurity is the domain where the concern is
to ensure the security of digital data and the privacy of
their owners. In today’s modern world, technology is be-
coming increasingly prevalent in everyday life and many
people stay almost always connected to the Internet [1].
While various social networks facilitate their users to share
their life events to the rest of the world intentionally, every
computer-based device they interact with in everyday life
leaves unintentional traces of their activities. Such sources
of forensic information include computer hard disks, net-
work activity logs, removable media, internal storage of
mobile phones and many others [2].
Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging trend started as
a narrow research domain called wireless sensor networks,
which evolved into Internet-connected everyday objects.
IoT ecosystem includes a wide variety of devices, such as
smart-watches, smart TVs, CCTV cameras, medical im-
plants, ﬁtness wearables, etc. The increasing availability

of IoT devices across society makes it inevitable to ﬁnd
them in modern crime scenes and digital forensic investi-
gations. Most of these devices comes with limited data
processing and storage capabilities and they usually pos-
sess limited standard interfaces to the outside world, such
as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces, unlike
their PC counterparts [3].
Due to the increasing concerns regarding security and
privacy among communities, modern digital devices, such
as computer systems, mobile devices, etc., are designed
and shipped with built-in security. Popular smartphones,
such as iOS and Android based devices, encrypt their in-
ternal storage in order to protect user data from third par-
ties [4]. Each of the mainstream PC operating systems,
such as Mac OS, Windows, and Linux, provide built-in
hard disk encryption. Meanwhile, network communica-
tions, both wired and wireless, commonly employ strong
packet encryption mechanisms [5]. Modern computer hard-
ware has made the automated handling of encrypted data
an everyday possibility in consumer, industrial and mili-
tary applications [6]. Computer devices seized at a crime
scene containing encrypted data poses a signiﬁcant chal-
lenge to the investigation [7, 8]. The IoT device ecosystem
is no exception for this data encryption trend making the
challenge of digital forensic investigations on IoT devices

even more complex.
Side-channel analysis attacks have been proven to be
useful to breach security on computer systems when stan-
dard interfaces, e.g., network interfaces and data storage
devices, are suﬃciently protected [9, 10, 11, 12]. In order
for a side-channel attack to be eﬀective in practical scenar-
ios for a security breach, it has to be executable without
having physical access to the device being attacked [13].
In the case of digital investigation, the investigator has the
freedom to handle the device, and ideally, any investigative
activity must not aﬀect or change the digital information
in the device [14]. Electromagnetic (EM) Side-channel At-
tacks is one approach that has shown promising results.
It requires minimum physical manipulations to the device
being inspected [15]. EM emissions of a device can be pas-
sively observed to infer both the internal operations being
performed and the data being handled [8]. This condition
is ideal for a digital investigator who attempts to ensure
that the device does not go though any physical changes
due to its investigation. It is worth noting that hardware
manufacturers are continuously trying to circumvent EM
side-channel attack vulnerabilities through EM shielding
and operation obfuscating enabled ﬁrmware.
This paper discusses the possibility for EM side-channel
analysis as a potential case-advancing possibility for digital
forensic analysis of IoT devices. A comprehensive analy-
sis of the literature is provided identifying some promis-
ing avenues for research and their future potential. EM
side-channel attacks for the recovery of cryptographic keys
and other forms of important information are evaluated for
potentially overcoming the encryption problem in digital
forensics on IoT devices. Since the nature of EM emis-
sion phenomena is associated with the power consumption
of computing devices [16], the literature that focuses on
power analysis attacks are also discussed where appropri-
ate.
The contribution of this work can be summarised as
follows:
• A comprehensive literature review and a compara-
tive study of the research that has been carried out
in EM side-channel analysis is provided and recent
advances are summarised.
• The scenarios where diﬀerent EM side-channel at-
tacks in the literature are relevant and applicable in
digital forensic investigations are identiﬁed.
• Light is shined on several new avenues of research
that are possible to achieve in digital forensic inves-
tigations and cybersecurity through the adoption of
EM side-channel analysis techniques.
• The shortage of reliable tools and frameworks avail-
able to utilise EM side-channel analysis for digital
forensic investigations on IoT devices is identiﬁed
and the recommendations are made to overcome it.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2
presents an overview of side-channel attacks. Sections 3, 4,
and 5 explores approaches for acquisition, unique identi-
ﬁcation, and information leakage EM emissions relevant
to digital forensics.
In Section 6, the advancements in
wireless communication technologies and standardisation,
and the legal background relevant to EM side-channels are
discussed. Section 7 provides insights of possible future
ethical directions of this technique. Finally, Section 8 con-
cludes the paper.
2. Side-Channel Attacks
The topic of side-channel attacks spans a wide variety
of techniques. Each side-channel attack on a computer
system focuses on one speciﬁc unintentional leakage of in-
formation from either hardware or software [9]. Some of
such information leaking side-channels are listed below.

diﬀerent inputs.
• The memory and cache spaces shared between dif-
• The amount of time a program takes to respond to
• The sounds diﬀerent components of computer hard-
• The amount of electricity a computer system draws.
• The EM radiation a computer hardware emits.
Computer programs contain conditional branches and
loops in order to handle inputs and produce the intended
output. Depending on the input values, the execution path
of a program can diﬀer, which may result in a diﬀerent pro-
gram execution time. It has been shown that the execution
time of encryption algorithms can reveal information re-
garding the input values provided to it, which includes the
encryption key [10]. For example, the square and mul-
tiplication segment in the RivestShamirAdleman (RSA)
algorithm checks whether a key bit is 0 or 1 before moving
into multiplication operations. Therefore, the observation
of large number of execution times with the same key and
diﬀerent input data can lead to uncovering the key bits
eﬀectively [10, 17, 18].
In environments where multiple virtual machines (VMs)
run on the same hardware, such as cloud infrastructure,
cache-based side-channel attacks are possible [11]. While
each VM has its own virtual resources, many of them are
mapped into shared physical resources including shared
cache memories. It has been shown that an attacker run-
ning a VM on a virtualised environment can spy on a vic-
tim VM through the shared cache storage. This can lead
to the extraction of sensitive information, including cryp-
tographic keys [19].
It has been shown that acoustic emanations from vari-
ous components and peripherals of computer systems can
be used to exﬁltrate information [12]. Genkin et al. showed
that it is possible to distinguish between CPU operations
2
by listening to acoustic emanations resulting in an attack
on the cryptographic keys of the RSA algorithm [20].
Computer displays and their video cables have also
been identiﬁed as an eavesdroppable EM source, which can
leak the image being displayed on the display. Such leak-
ages from CRT based displays have been known for several
decades [21]. Video information provided to a computer
display has synchronisation information to recognise be-
tween diﬀerent lines of pixels and diﬀerent frames, which
are called horizontal and vertical synchronisations. By
recognising this synchronisation information in the EM
emissions, an attacker can reconstruct the images being
displayed [22, 23].
Kocher et al. were the ﬁrst to introduce power con-
sumption based side-channel attacks; simple power analy-
sis (SPA) and diﬀerential power analysis (DPA) [24]. SPA
collects power consumption variation (in mA) over time
with a high sample rate, such as twice the clock frequency
of target cryptographic device. The waveform of the power
consumption, when plotted against time, contained pat-
terns that corresponded to the instructions of the data en-
cryption standard cryptographic algorithm (DES). If SPA
can reveal the sequence of operations, it follows that this
sequence depends on the data being handled by the algo-
rithm (due to conditional branching). Designing code to
minimise data dependent branching, which does not show
characteristic power consumption patterns for speciﬁc op-
erations, can prevent attackers from recognising what is
executing on the device [25].
DPA is a technique that can be custom tailored for
speciﬁc encryption algorithms. Kocher et al. used the
DPA technique against DES [24]. The technique was able
to guess the encryption key accurately, given suﬃcient ci-
pher texts and power traces for those encryption opera-
tions. The authors claim that they have used DPA to re-
verse engineer various unknown algorithms and protocols
on devices. The authors state that it may be possible to
automate this reverse engineering process. Kocher et al.
hints that these techniques (SPA, DPA) might be usable
with EM emissions too in addition to power consumption.
While various side-channel attacks are possible on com-
puter systems, it is possible to increase the advantages
achievable by combining multiple side-channels that leak
diﬀerent kinds of information together [26]. For example,
power analysis and EM analysis can be performed together
in order to reduce the errors and improve the accuracy of
inferring the leaked information from a computer system.
3. Unintentional Electromagnetic Emissions
EM radiation is the underlying technology for numer-
ous of wireless communication. Meanwhile, it is a well
documented fact that electronic devices generate EM radi-
ation on unintended frequencies as a side eﬀect of their in-
ternal operations [27]. Such unintended EM radiation are
regulated by government agencies, such as Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC) in the USA, due to the
3
possible interference they can make on legitimate wireless
communication and the potential health issues they can
cause to the users of these devices. However, it is not pos-
sible to entirely avoid such emissions. Equipment manu-
facturers attempt to minimise it as much as possible [28].
This section discusses how EM signals are generated from
diﬀerent components of a computer system, what kind of
information they may carry, and what types of methods
and tools can be used to capture these signals.
3.1. Hardware that Causes Electromagnetic Emissions
As derived from Maxwell’s equations, EM waves can
be generated by electric currents varying over time. Char-
acteristics of the EM waves being generated, such as fre-
quency, amplitude, and phase, depends on the nature of
the time varying electric current [29]. Based on this prin-
ciple, modern communication systems generate oscillating
currents on antennas that generate EM waves that prop-
agate over free space. They can be captured by another
antenna with appropriate properties. Modern digital com-
puter systems have a large number of components that
depend on electric pulses or alternating currents for their
operations. That leaves the space for EM waves to be gen-
erated at unexpected frequencies without the intention of
the system manufacturer.
There are multiple computer components that oper-
ate in a coordinated, sequential fashion according to clock
signals. Among them, both the CPU and RAM are of
