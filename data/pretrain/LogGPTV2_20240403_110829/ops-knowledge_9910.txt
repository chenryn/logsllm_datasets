User: I am doing allot of network developing and I am starting a new research.
I need to send a packet which will then cause another SYN packet to be sent.
This is how I want it to look:
I send syn -->  --> sends another SYN before SYN/ACK packet.
How can I cause?
I am using Scapy + Python.
Assistant: I don't know if I understand you correctly. Is there any difference between your two SYN packets? If so, just create two SYN as you want and then send them together. If not, send same packets twice using scapy.send(pkt, 2).I don't remember the specific parameters, but I'm sure scapy.send can send as many packets and fast as you like.
