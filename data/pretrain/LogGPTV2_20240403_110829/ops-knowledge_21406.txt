Assistant: Docker is a containerization platform that can be used to easily execute, deploy and manage applications. Compared with traditional virtualization technology, Docker utilizes container technology to provide a faster and lighter virtualization solution. Docker has the following advantages: 1. Simplified development: Docker can quickly create and destroy various containers, which helps developers quickly test and deploy different applications. 2. Better portability: By using Docker containers, applications can be ensured to run well in different environments, making it easier for developers to deploy their applications. 3. Lighter virtualization: Compared with traditional virtualization technologies, Docker containers are lighter and faster. To install Docker on Linux, follow these steps: 1. Install Docker's dependencies: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common 2. Add Docker's official signing key: curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - 3. Add Docker's official APT repository: sudo add-apt-repository" deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" 4. Run the update command again: sudo apt-get update 5. Install Docker CE: sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io 6. Confirm whether Docker is successfully installed: sudo docker run hello-world After the installation is complete, you can use the Docker command line interface to manage containers.
