User: I'm looking at using CouchDB for one project and the GAE app engine datastore in the other.  For relational stuff I tend to use postgres, although I much prefer an ORM.  
Anyway, what use cases suit non relational datastores best?
Assistant: Consider the situation where you have many entity types but few instances of each entity. In this case you will have many tables each with a few records so a relational approach is not suitable.
