### Implementation and Performance

Since we had full access to the DSP’s capabilities, we implemented the receiver using the frequency shift keying modulation scheme (FSK), where a ‘1’ and ‘0’ were modulated by using two distinct frequencies. Creating two carrier waves was accomplished by adding a slight delay inside the memory transfer operation loop. This version of the GSMem transmitter was not implemented on a cellular device, so the rest of its details are omitted from this paper.

Using this hardware, we significantly improved the reception distance. At a distance of 2.6 meters and with \( T = 0.001 \), we achieved a bit rate of 1000 bit/s, with a BER of approximately 0.087%. Table 6 summarizes the time needed to transfer certain pieces of sensitive information at the rates of \( T = 0.5 \) (using Motorola C123) and \( T = 0.001 \) (using USRP).

### Bit Rates

The GSMem receiver, implemented using OsmocomBB on a nine-year-old mobile phone, significantly limits the channel’s quality. Although this device provides the advantage of GSM baseband programmability, it has limited real-time processing power and inadequate access to the DSP’s full capabilities. Due to these limitations, we preferred using simple ASK type modulations over more sophisticated options. Using the proposed B-ASK modulation with this device, we were able to receive binary data from the GSMem transmitter at a bit rate of 1 to 2 bit/s. This allows exfiltration of small amounts of information such as identifiers, passwords, and encryption keys within several minutes. We examined the bit error rate (BER) by transmitting a set of 256-bit encryption keys from a workstation. Figure 12 depicts the BER over varying distances between the transmitting workstation and a nearby mobile phone.

### Software Defined Radio (SDR)

Much higher bit rates, even at further distances, are achievable when more modern equipment is used and the full capabilities of the baseband component are accessible. To demonstrate this, we implemented a GSMem receiver using GNU-Radio software on an affordable SDR kit; the Ettus Research Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) B210 [54], capable of capturing data at velocities up to 32 million samples per second. The USRP was connected to the USB 3.0 interface of a Lenovo ThinkPad T530, with dedicated software suitable for capturing signals from the USRP, i.e., GNU-Radio v3.7.5.1. The OS is Linux Ubuntu 14.10 (64 bit).

**Table 6: Transmission times**

| Data Length (bit) | MD5 | GPS Coordinate | MAC Address | Plain Password | Disk Encryption Key | RSA Private Key | SHA1 Hash |
|-------------------|-----|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 48                | 30 sec | 40 sec | 1.3 sec | 1.3 sec | 1.6 min | 2.6 min | 21.3 min | 29.1 min |
| 64                | 48 ms | 64 ms | 128 ms | 128 ms | 160 ms | 256 ms | 2.04 sec | 2.8 sec |

To increase the effective distance, we used a directed printed circuit board (PCB) log periodic antenna [55], optimized for capturing signals in the range of 400 MHz – 1000 MHz. The antenna was connected to the USRP via its standard connectors.

We measured the signal levels of ‘1’ and ‘0’ emitted from a transmitting WS3 over varying distances. The transmitter resides in a regular workspace with several active desktop workstations situated within a 10-meter radius. As shown in Figure 13, the signals were received at 30 meters and beyond, a significant improvement compared to the mobile phone receiver. These results were obtained with affordable hardware using commonly available components.

### Countermeasures

Official standards concerning EMSEC countermeasures are mainly classified, despite some occasional leaks [16], [56]. With the exfiltration method described in this paper, the "zones" approach may be used as a countermeasure, defining spatial regions where mobile phones, including simple devices, are prohibited. However, the signal reception distance may grow when a dedicated hardware receiver is used. In this context, the insulation of partition walls may help. Structural building elements, such as reinforced concrete floors, seem to provide insulation by acting as a Faraday cage. However, enclosing each computer within a Faraday cage seems impractical. Shielding the transmitting component within the computer, i.e., the multi-channel memory bus, is a challenging task, particularly when compared to shielding other emanation sources, such as monitor cables. Another defensive strategy may involve behavioral (dynamic) analysis and anomaly detection to detect GSMem activities at runtime on the process level [9] [57]. However, when the baseband firmware is utilized as the GSMem receiver, it is particularly hard to detect because of the separation of the baseband component from the main operating system [49]. In this case, a meticulous forensic analysis of the device may be required.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present GSMem, a method for exfiltrating data from air-gapped networks. Our major contributions include a unique covert channel, consisting of a feasible transmitting method and a ubiquitous receiver that doesn’t arouse suspicion. The covert channel is based on electromagnetic waves emitted at frequency bands of GSM, UMTS, and LTE cellular networks. The transmitting software exploits specific memory-related CPU instructions, utilizing the multi-channel memory bus to amplify the transmission power. Subsequently, the transmitted signals are received and demodulated by a rootkit residing at the baseband level of a cellular phone. Note that, unlike some other recent work in this field, GSMem exploits components that are virtually guaranteed to be present on any desktop/server computer and cellular phone. Furthermore, elementary cellular phones, those without Wi-Fi, camera, or other nonessential instrumentation, are often allowed into classified facilities, even in security-aware organizations. We provide essential technical background information about cellular networks and an overview of baseband components in mobile phones. Next, we discuss the design considerations of the transmitter and the receiver, regarding data modulation, transmission detection, noise mitigation, and handling a moving receiver. Our GSMem transmission software—implemented on Windows and Linux—has a small computational footprint, making it hard to detect. The GSMem receiver is implemented on a mobile phone by modifying the baseband firmware of a low-end device. We present its architecture and discuss its capabilities and limitations. We go on to evaluate the method’s performance using extensive configurations, settings, and various parameters. Our current results demonstrate the overall feasibility of the method, at a distance of 1-5.5 meters when using a standard cellular baseband receiver. We also evaluated the wider boundaries of GSMem using a dedicated yet affordable hardware receiver. The associated experiments yielded an effective distance of 30 meters and beyond. We believe that exposing this new covert channel will serve to raise professional awareness and academic interest.
