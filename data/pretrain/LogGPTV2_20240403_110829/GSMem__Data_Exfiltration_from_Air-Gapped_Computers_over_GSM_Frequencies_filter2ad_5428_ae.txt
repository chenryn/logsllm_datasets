Since we had full access to the DSP‚Äôs capabilities, we 
implemented  the  receiver  using  the  frequency  shift 
keying modulation scheme (FSK) where a ‚Äò1‚Äô and ‚Äò0‚Äô 
were  modulated  by  using  two  distinct  frequencies. 
Creating  two  carrier  waves  was  accomplished  by 
adding  a  slight  delay  inside  the  memory  transfer 
operation  loop.  Since  this  version  of  the  GSMem 
transmitter  was  not implemented  on a  cellular  device, 
we  omit  the  rest  of  its  details  from  the  body  of  this 
paper.  Using  this  hardware,  we  were  able  to  improve 
the 
reception  distance 
significantly.  At  a  distance  of  2.6m  and  where ùëá=
0.001, we achieved a bit rate of 1000 bit/s, with a BER 
of approximately 0.087%. Table 6 summarizes the time

and T=0.001 (using USRP).

7.3.  Bit Rates 
The GSMem receiver implemented using OsmocomBB 
on  the  nine  year  old  mobile  phone  significantly  limit 
the channel‚Äôs quality. Although this device provides the 
advantage  of  GSM  baseband  programmability,  it  has 
limited  real-time  processing  power  and  inadequate 
access  to  the  DSP‚Äôs  full  capabilities.  Due  to  these 
limitations,  we  preferred  using  simple  ASK  type 
modulations  over  other  more  sophisticated  options. 
Using  the  proposed  B-ASK  modulation  with  this 
device,  we  were  able  to  receive  binary  data  from  the 
GSMem  transmitter  at  a  bit  rate  of  1  to  2  bit/s.  This 
allows  exfiltration  of  small  amounts  of  information 
such  as  identifiers,  passwords,  and  encryption  keys, 
within several minutes. We examined the bit error rate 
(BER) by transmitting a set of 256-bit encryption keys 
from  a  workstation.    Figure  12  depicts  the  BER  over 
varying distances between the transmitting workstation 
and a nearby mobile phone.

7.4.  Software Defined Radio (SDR) 
Much higher bit rates  -  at even further distances  -  are 
achievable  when more modern  equipment  is  used  and 
the  full  capabilities  of  the  baseband  component  are 
accessible. To demonstrate this fact, we implemented a 
GSMem  receiver  using  GNU-Radio  software  on  an 
affordable  SDR  kit;  the  Ettus  Research  Universal 
Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) B210 [54], which is 
capable of capturing data at velocities up to 32 million 
samples  per  second.  The  USRP  was  connected  to 
the  USB  3.0 
Lenovo  ThinkPad  T530 
interface),  with  dedicated  software  suitable 
for 
capturing  signals  from  the  USRP,  i.e.  GNU-Radio 
v3.7.5.1. The OS is Linux Ubuntu 14.10 (64 bit).

In  order  to  increase  the  effective  distance,  we  used  a 
directed  printed  circuit  board  (PCB)  log  periodic 
antenna  [55],  optimized  for  capturing  signals  at  the 
range of 400 MHz ‚Äì 1000 MHz. The antenna connected 
to the USRP via its standard connectors. 
We  measured  the  signal  levels  of  ‚Äò1‚Äô  and  ‚Äò0‚Äô  emitted 
from  a  transmitting  WS3  over  varying  distances.  The 
transmitter resides in a regular work space with several 
active  desktop  workstations  situated  within  a  10m 
radius.  As  can  be  seen  in  Figure  13,  the  signals  were 
received in 30 meters and beyond. This is a significant 
improvement  when  compared  to  the  mobile  phone 
receiver. Furthermore, these results were obtained with 
a rather affordable hardware receiver, using commonly 
available components.

8.  Countermeasures 
Official 
standards 
concerning  EMSEC  countermeasures  are  mainly 
classified,  despite  some  occasional  leaks  [16],  [56]. 
With the exfiltration method described in this paper, the 
"zones"  approach  may  be  used  as  a  countermeasure, 
defining spatial regions where mobile phones, including 
simple  devices,  are  prohibited.  As  discussed  earlier, 
however, the signal reception distance may grow when 
dedicated  hardware  receiver  is  being  used.  In  this 
context,  the  insulation  of  partition  walls  may  help. 
Structural  building  elements,  such  as  reinforced 
concrete floors, seem to provide insulation by acting as 
a  Faraday  cage.  However,  enclosing  each  computer 
within a Faraday cage seems impractical. Shielding the 
transmitting  component  within  the  computer,  i.e.,  the 
multi-channel  memory  bus  is  a  challenging  task, 
particularly  when  compared 
shielding  other 
emanation  sources,  such  as  monitor  cables.    Another 
defensive  strategy  may  involve  behavioral  (dynamic) 
analysis  and  anomaly  detection, 
to  detect 
GSMem  activities  at  runtime  on  the  process  level  [9] 
[57]. However, when the baseband firmware is utilized 
as the GSMem receiver, it is particularly hard to detect 
because  of  the  separation  of  the  baseband  component 
from  the  main  operating  system  [49].  In  this  case,  a 
meticulous  forensic  analysis  of  the  device  may  be 
required. 
9.  Conclusion 
In  this  paper  we  present  GSMem,  a  method  for 
exfiltrating data from air-gapped networks.  Our major 
contributions 
include  a  unique  covert  channel, 
consisting  of  a  feasible  transmitting  method,  and  a 
ubiquitous  receiver  that  doesn‚Äôt arouse  suspicion. The 
covert  channel  is  based  on  electromagnetic  waves 
trying 
to 
the 
emitted at  frequency  bands of  GSM,  UMTS and LTE 
cellular  networks.  The  transmitting  software  exploits 
specific memory-related CPU instructions, utilizing the 
multi-channel memory bus to amplify the transmission 
power.  Subsequently, 
transmitted  signals  are 
received  and  demodulated  by  a  rootkit residing at the 
baseband  level  of  a  cellular  phone.  Note  that,  unlike 
some other recent work in this field, GSMem exploits 
components that are virtually guaranteed to be present 
on  any  desktop/server  computer  and  cellular  phone. 
Furthermore, elementary cellular phones, those without 
Wi-Fi,  camera,  or  other  nonessential  instrumentation, 
are  often  allowed  into  classified  facilities,  even  in 
security-aware  organizations.  We  provide  essential 
technical  background 
information  about  cellular 
networks and an overview of baseband components in 
mobile  phones.  Next,  we  discuss 
the  design 
considerations  of  the  transmitter  and  the  receiver, 
regarding 
data  modulation, 
transmission detection, noise mitigation, and handling a 
moving receiver. Our GSMem transmission software - 
implemented  on  Windows  and  Linux  -  has  a  small 
computational footprint, which makes it hard to detect. 
The  GSMem  receiver  is  implemented  on  a  mobile 
phone, by modifying the baseband firmware of a low-
end device. We present its architecture and discuss its 
capabilities  and limitations.  We  go  on  to  evaluate  the 
method‚Äôs  using  extensive  configurations,  settings,  and 
various parameters. Our current results demonstrate the 
overall feasibility of the method, at a distance of 1-5.5 
meters  when  using  a  standard  cellular  baseband 
receiver.  We  also  evaluated  the  wider  boundaries  of 
GSMem  using  a  dedicated  yet  affordable  hardware 
receiver.  The  associated  experiments  yielded  an 
effective distance of 30 meters and beyond. We believe 
that exposing this new covert channel will serve to raise 
professional awareness and academic interest.
