User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SFTP error "Received unexpected end-of-file from SFTP server" on CentOS 6 I'm getting this SFTP error "Received unexpected end-of-file from SFTP server" on CentOS 6.

I've added a new user below

sudo adduser --shell /bin/false paul

sudo passwd paul

Then edited /etc/ssh/ssh_config to contain this and restarted the sshd service

# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.  See
# ssh_config(5) for more information.  This file provides defaults for
# users, and the values can be changed in per-user configuration files
# or on the command line.

# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# Site-wide defaults for some commonly used options.  For a comprehensive
# list of available options, their meanings and defaults, please see the
# ssh_config(5) man page.

I've searched through the similar questions and most just say add  

Subsystem sftp internal-sftp


Which I've done but hasn't helped.
What could be causing this error?

EDIT:

Here are the log content from /var/log/secure

Oct  4 16:34:45 WEBDB sshd[50124]: Accepted password for paul from *.*.*.* port 7093 ssh2
Oct  4 16:34:45 WEBDB sshd[50124]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user paul by (uid=0)
Oct  4 16:34:45 WEBDB sshd[50126]: subsystem request for sftp
Oct  4 16:34:45 WEBDB sshd[50124]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user paul

Assistant: I believe you should add the Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
to /etc/ssh/sshd_config
(and not to /etc/ssh/ssh_config)
