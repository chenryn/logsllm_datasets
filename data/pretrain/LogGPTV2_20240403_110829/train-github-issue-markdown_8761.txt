Flask's automatic redirects to add a trailing slash don't appear to work for
the root view. This isn't noticeable when the application is mounted at the
root of a domain, but mine is mounted in a subdirectory using mod-wsgi:
WSGIScriptAlias /myapp /path/to/myapp/modwsgi/stub.py
The result is that when someone visits http://mysite/myapp, none of the
application's relative urls work. (This is expected if the trailing slash is
missing, because a relative url like static/image.png means something
different depending on whether the current page is http://foo/bar or
http://foo/bar/)
