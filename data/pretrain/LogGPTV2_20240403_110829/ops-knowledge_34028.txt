User: So I do logging.config.fileConfig to setup my logging from a file config that has console and file handler. Then I do logging.getLogger(name) to get my logger and log. At certain times I want the filehandler's filename to change i.e. log rotate (I can't use time rotator because of some issues with Windows platform) so to do that I call logger.handlers - it shows an empty list, so I cant close them!! However when I step through the debugger, its clearly not empty (well of course without it I wouldn't be able to log right)
Not sure whats going on here, any gotchas that I'm missing?
Appreciate any help. Thanks.
Assistant: Maybe there is no such name as 'TimeRoatingFileHandler' because you missed 'd' in word 'Timed'. So it must be: 'TimedRoatingFileHandler'
