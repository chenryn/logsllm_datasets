# Bug report
## Describe the bug
Upgrading to Next 9.0 from 8.1 breaks any Jest tests for components that use
dynamic imports syntax (not using `next/dynamic`) :
      ● OurComponent › test
        Not supported
          78 |   public componentDidMount(): void {
          79 |     if (this.ref.current) {
        > 80 |       import('./some-other-file').then(
             |       ^
This appears to be due to `babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node` being removed
from the `next/babel` preset to fix another issue in this Spectrum post.
In my use case, I'm not importing another component, so it seemed unnecessary
to use `next/dynamic` here. However, looking at the documentation, I would
have suspected that usage like the documentation suggests should also break
Jest tests due to it using dynamic import syntax as well:
    const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello'));
## To Reproduce
  1. Use `next/babel` preset in `.babelrc`.
  2. Create a component that uses a dynamic import (e.g. in `componentDidMount`).
  3. Create a test that renders the component.
## Expected behavior
Tests should not fail.
