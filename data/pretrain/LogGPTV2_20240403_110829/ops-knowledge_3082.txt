User: How can I read the colors of an image with python using google app engine?
Example: I like to build a function to determine the most striking colors of an image to set a harmonic background color for it.
Assistant: If you are willing to put Flash or a Java applet on the page, you might be able to do it on the client. I'm not sure if anything like canvas or SVG supports pixel-level manipulation, but if they do, you might be able to get it to work in some browsers with JavaScript.
The Flash or Java Applet, can be invisible and optional -- you can use JavaScript to detect if the user has the plugin and only support this feature when they do.
