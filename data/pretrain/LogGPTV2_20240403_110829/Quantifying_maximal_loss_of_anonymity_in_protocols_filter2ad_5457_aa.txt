ABSTRACT
There is a natural intuitive match between anonymity and
information theory. In particular, the maximal anonymity
loss in anonymity protocols can be matched to the informa-
tion theoretical notion of channel capacity.
However, there is also a signiﬁcant mismatch between the
theories and reality: current theories can only characterize
channel capacity based upon certain assumptions of symme-
try, which are rarely satisﬁed in the real world.
This paper aims to resolve this mismatch by appealing to
powerful mathematical techniques. A generic methodology
using Lagrange multiplier method is proposed to character-
ize channel capacity in anonymity protocols.
This Lagrangian approach is proved to be able to gen-
eralize previous work on the channel capacity of protocols.
Further, we present analyses on three well known protocols,
namely Dining Cryptographers, Crowds and Onion Routing
to demonstrate the application of our methodology.

INTRODUCTION
Anonymity protocols are playing an increasingly impor-
tant role in many key ﬁelds, such as electronic communica-
tion, auction, payment and voting. They are designed to
enhance the information privacy of legitimate users while
performing certain activities. For example, electronic vot-
ing protocols try to protect the conﬁdentiality of individual

votes, while anonymous routing protocols (e.g. Onion Rout-
ing [24] and Crowds[25]) try to hide the information of “who
is communicating with who” when users carry out web ac-
tivities.
However, these protocols can not completely prevent the
loss of anonymity, but instead try to reduce them. For ex-
ample, if there are a number of adversaries within the onion
routing network then a substantial chance exists that the
attacker can infer something about the sender. Therefore
it is important not only to realize such information leakage,
but also to quantify the loss of anonymity.
In this paper, we analyze the anonymity loss over a covert
channel, whose input is the “anonymous” events and out-
put is the “observable” events. Then the channel capacity
represents exactly the maximal anonymity loss.
An important recent work [4] characterizes maximal loss
of anonymity using information theoretical results on binary
channels, however its applicability is limited to protocols
satisfying certain symmetry properties. Indeed, and this is
the main motivation of this paper, real world cases rarely
satisfy such properties. For example, for anonymity rout-
ing protocols the symmetry assumptions will amount to “all
nodes having the same probability of being the originator of
a message”, which is totally inaccurate.
In contrast, we present a methodology using Lagrange
multiplier method to solve the channel capacity by maximiz-
ing the anonymity loss function. This Lagrangian method-
ology introduces a generic solution which does not require
the symmetry assumptions. It also enables to reﬂect some
interesting relationships in an anonymity system, for ex-
ample, “Google is 100 times more likely to send a message
than server X, Y and 1000 times more likely than any other
server”. These kind of relationships can be easily represented
by constraints when solving the Lagrangian equations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
brieﬂy reviews the Lagrange multiplier method. Section 3
deﬁnes the quantiﬁcation of anonymity loss in protocols.
Section 4 introduces our methodology, applying Lagrange
method to the channel capacity problem; in Subsection 4.2
we prove that the characterization of channel capacity of
symmetric protocols in [4] is a special case of our method.
Section 5 and 6 apply the theory to the Dining Cryptog-
raphers and Crowds protocols respectively and present the
solution to their channel capacity in the asymmetric set-
ting. Section 7 presents a use-case study of Onion Routing,
where quantitative measurement is coupled with studies of
the impact of the connectivity and path-length settings in
the anonymous routing protocol. Section 8 concludes the
206paper and outlines our future work.
1.1 Contributions
This paper introduces a methodology for quantifying max-
imal loss of anonymity in anonymity protocols.
The idea is straightforward but not trivial. We use the
classical Lagrange multiplier method to solve a maximiza-
tion problem that obtains the channel capacity by maximiz-
ing the anonymity loss function. With this methodology we
preliminarily solved a diﬃcult problem in information the-
ory (pg. 191 from [6]): the channel capacity of asymmetric
channels.
Moreover, our approach is both generic and practical. It
works for almost any anonymity protocol to enable charac-
terization of the channel capacity between anonymous events
and public observations. Especially, in contrast to previous
studies it elegantly deals with asymmetric anonymity proto-
cols. Such asymmetric cases are, as argued above, of great
practical signiﬁcance.
Hence the techniques introduced in this paper are also an
important contribution to the ﬁeld: they are not incremen-
tal to any previous work in this area and, to the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst-ever application of this kind
of mathematical techniques to the quantitative analysis of
protocols.
Further, although the paper focuses on the general method-
ology, our case studies show insight into the solution of in-
teresting problems in the network security community, e.g.
how to optimize protocol parameters (like path length) to
enhance the anonymity in an onion routing network.
1.2 Related Works
The mainstream approach to analysis of anonymity pro-
tocols is probabilistic, as proposed by M. Reed, P. Syverson
and D. Goldschlag [24]. There are many existing works in
this topic: Guan et al.
[17] measured the probability of
a sender being discovered in an anonymous communication
system, and quantiﬁed the impact from path length, path
topology and the number of compromised nodes. Shmatikov
and Wang described anonymity in protocols with entropy,
and applied Zipﬁan distributions to estimate the average
entropy in a somehow more realistic model [29]. Wright,
Adler, Levine and Shields [28] quantitatively analyzed and
cross-compared several anonymity protocols according to
certain attacks. Recently, J.Feigenmbaum, A. Johnson and
P. Syverson in [14] proposed a probabilistic analysis of the
anonymity in Onion Routing using a black-box model. There
also have been increasing interest on the problem of sta-
tistical attacks. Danezis, Diaz and Troncoso [10] analyze
a two-sided statistical disclosure attack considering peering
and timing information of both initial messages and replies.
Pashalidis and Meyer [23] show an attack that links trans-
action history with pseudonym in pseudonym systems.
Theoretically, a probabilistic approach would be able to
work out an expectation of anonymity in certain models; in
comparison, this paper is toward ﬁnding a general method-
ology to quantify the maximal loss that may occur, which
is an even more important problem but has not yet been
satisfactorily solved.
The closest work to ours is by Chatzikokolakis, Palamidessi
and Panangaden [4]. Although the work is inspiring and
shares the same background with this paper, their method-
ology only works for “symmetric protocols” and in this sense
is a particular case of our work. Further discussions com-
paring this work with ours will be presented in Subsection
3.3 and 4.2.
Other recent information theoretical approaches to anony-
mity analysis include [12] and [27]. Also, Shmatikov applied
a probabilistic model checking tool Prism to quantitatively
analyze anonymity systems [29]. Another interesting work
is the one by Franz, Meyer and Pashalidis [15] who analyze
anonymity leakage cause by particular “hints” that an ad-
versary may obtain from the context. However, this work
is not general and again assumes a uniform distribution on
the anonymous events.
The use of conditional mutual information in the context
of information leakage has been pioneered by Gray, Denning,
McLean and Millen [16, 11, 9, 19, 20]. More recent works
using conditional mutual information to measure informa-
tion leakage have been by Clark, Hunt, Malacaria, Boreale
and Chen [7, 8, 22, 2]. These works support this paper from
the theory aspect.
In previous literature there was also a general method for
solving the problem of channel capacity, namely the Blahut-
Arimoto iterative method [6]. While our technique provides
a solution via a system of equations, the Blahut-Arimoto
method iteratively searches for an approximate solution.
Lagrange multipliers are used by Malacaria and Chen [21]
to compute the maximum leakage of deterministic programs.
Although sharing similar techniques in between, there is also
a signiﬁcant technical novelty in this paper to cope with the
nondeterministic nature of anonymity protocols.
2. LAGRANGE METHOD
We will illustrate the use of the Lagrange method by a
simple example below. For formal deﬁnitions and a tutorial,
we refer the reader to the literature [6, 18].
2.1 A simple example
Suppose we want to maximize the following function:
10 − (x − 5)2 − (y − 3)2
It is easy to see that the maximum is achieved by x = 5, y =
3.
Now a constraint x+y = 1 is added to the above problem.
Then the above solution is no longer correct. The Lagrange
multiplier method combines the original function with the
constraint together in a new function F
10 − (x − 5)2 − (y − 3)2 + λ(x + y − 1)
where λ is a number which indicates the weight associated
with the constraint, for example ignoring the constraint is
equivalent to setting λ = 0.
The term λ is the Lagrange multiplier and the Lagrange
technique consists in ﬁnding the maximum of the function
F by diﬀerentiating on x, y and λ.
In this example the derivatives generate the equations:
−2x + 10 + λ = 0, −2y + 6 + λ = 0, x + y − 1 = 0
The ﬁrst two equations imply x = y + 2 and by replacing
this in the last equation we get
y + 2 + y = 1, i.e. y = − 1
2
207It is then easy to derive the values for the other variables
i.e.
x =
, λ = −7

Now the values x = 3
2 do satisfy the constraint.
They are also the values that maximize the original function

ated on this point has value -14.5. If we take other values
satisfying x+y = 1 we can only get lower results, e.g. 0.5, 0.5
results in -16.5 and 1, 0 results in −15.
2.2 Lagrange Theorem
In a general setting let L(x, λ) be the Lagrangian of a
function f subject to a family of constraints C1≤i≤m (where
Ci ≡ gi(x) = bi), i.e.
L(x, λ) = f (x) +
λi(gi(x) − bi)
X
1≤i≤n
The basic result justifying Lagrange multipliers is the fol-
lowing theorem:
Theorem 2.1. Assume the vector x∗ = (x∗
n) max-
imizes (or minimizes) the function f (x) subject to the con-
straints (gi(x) = bi)1≤i≤m. Then either
1, . . . , x∗
1. the vectors (∇gi(x∗))1≤i≤m are linearly dependent, or
2. there exists a vector λ∗ = (λ∗
1, . . . , λ∗
m) such that
∇L(λ∗, x∗) = 0 i.e.

) = 0)1≤i≤n,

(

δλi
) = 0)1≤i≤m,
where ∇ is the gradient.
The reverse implication of the theorem is valid when some
properties are satisﬁed. Roughly speaking a maximum is ob-
tained when f is concave and a minimum when f is convex.
The previous example is obtained by the following instan-
tiations:
f (x1, x2) = 10 − (x1 − 5)2 − (x2 − 3)2, C ≡ x1 + x2 = 1
In this paper we will assume that the constraints Ci are
“statistics” or expectations , i.e.
linear expressions in the
form of
X
xjfj,i = Fi
j
More generally, non-linear constraints need to satisfy addi-
tional properties of concavity (convexity) for the theory to
work.
3. ANONYMITY PROTOCOLS
3.1 Modeling Anonymity Protocol
As presented in [4], anonymity protocols can usually be
modeled in a probabilistic setting. We consider an anony-
mity protocol as a triple
hA,O, φi
where A is a set of anonymous events, and O is a set of obser-
vations. To introduce probabilities we associate the random
variables h for A and O for O respectively. Then, φ ex-
presses the conditional probability between the two random
variables.
The “secret” in this model is the information of which
event in A (i.e. which input) caused the observed observa-
tion in O. We denote members of A as hi ∈ A.
The above triple can be represented by the protocol ma-
trix shown in Table 1. Rows describe elements of A, columns
describe elements of O and the value at position (hi, ok) is
the conditional probability φk,i. This is the chance of ob-
serving ok given hi as input.
3.2 Channel Capacity
The loss of anonymity of a protocol can be deﬁned as the
diﬀerence in anonymity before and after the observations,
i.e. in information theoretical terms this amount to the mu-
tual information1 between h and O. Formally, it is deﬁned
by the well known information theoretical equation:
Definition 3.1. The anonymity loss of a protocol
hA,O, φi is deﬁned as
I(h; O) = H(h) − H(h|O)
where H(h) is the uncertainty of anonymous events in A
and H(h|O) is the remaining uncertainty after observing O.
Consider the following simple example: n voters vote for
Clinton or Obama.
• Observations: n ballots which are split in c votes for
Clinton and o votes for Obama.
• Anonymity loss: how much information about the iden-
tity of a voter for Clinton (or for Obama) is revealed
by the observations c and o.
If O is considered as an output set, the triple hA,O, φi
can be regarded as a probabilistic channel. Diﬀerent distri-
butions on h will result in diﬀerent anonymity losses I(h; O).
What people are interested in is the worst case that can hap-
pen in the protocol: what is the maximum value of I(h; O)?
We use the deﬁnition for channel capacity to describe it.
Definition 3.2. The channel capacity of a protocol
hA,O, φi is deﬁned as
C = max I(h; O)
Up until now we assumed that we know nothing about
the anonymous events A. However as pointed out in [4] in
most cases some information about the anonymous events
is allowed to be revealed by the design of the protocol. In
this case there is some knowledge R about the anonymous

208events A, for example in a voting protocol that could be the
number of votes for a candidate. This observation leads to
an extension of the two previous deﬁnitions.
Definition 3.3. The conditional loss of anonymity of a
protocol hA,O, φi with given knowledge R is deﬁned as
I(h; O|R) = H(h|R) − H(h|O, R)
