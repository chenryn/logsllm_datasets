We presented PID-Piper, a framework that uses a Feed-
Forward Controller (FFC) for recovering Robotic Vehicles
(RVs) from attacks. The FFC in PID-Piper uses a Machine
Learning (ML) model to emulate the RV’s PID controller. The
FFC-based ML model prevents over-compensation and high
collinearity, making it resilient to attacks.
We evaluate PID-Piper on 3 real RVs and 3 simulated RVs.
We ﬁnd that PID-Piper (1) achieves 0% false positives in
the absence of attacks, (2) recovers RVs from overt attacks
and achieves mission success in over 83% of the cases, (3)
signiﬁcantly limits impacts of stealthy attacks to achieve 100%
mission success, and (4) incurs low performance overheads.
