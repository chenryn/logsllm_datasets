## 1. Introduction
Modern wireless networks, especially those designed for enterprises such as airports, universities, and corporate campuses, often feature multiple APs connected to a central controller via a high-speed wired backbone. This backbone facilitates out-of-band communication among APs, providing opportunities for advanced association control protocols beyond the traditional RSSI-based methods. Our proposal exploits the hybrid nature of these networks to improve client-AP associations by combining information from multiple APs to enhance load balancing and connection admittance.

Using the wired backbone, APs share the presence of clients within their communication ranges. Each AP aggregates this global information and categorizes the network into "exclusive" and "overlapping" zones. Exclusive zones are covered by a single AP, while overlapping zones are covered by multiple APs. Clients in exclusive zones must associate with a specific AP, while those in overlapping zones have a choice among two or more APs. The APs then collaboratively model the system as a graph-theoretic max-flow problem to generate the optimal client-AP assignment. These assignments are communicated back to the clients, resulting in improved performance as clients are distributed among different APs, even if their received signal strength is relatively weaker.

## 2. Fair Bandwidth Allocation (FBA)

### Basic Protocol
In our scheme, a client initially associates with an AP using RSSI-based association. During this process, the client also conveys the IDs of all APs it has recently overheard. The AP shares this information with other APs over the wired backbone, enabling them to learn about the distribution of clients in different zones. The FBA algorithm, which runs periodically, applies the max-flow algorithm to determine the optimal client-AP association configuration based on the current device distribution.

### Metrics
We use two metrics to evaluate the FBA algorithm: Jain's Fairness Index (JFI) and Percentage of Connection Admitted (PCA).

- **Jain's Fairness Index (JFI):**
  \[
  JFI = \frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m} F_Ri\right)^2}{m \times \sum_{i=1}^{m} (F_Ri)^2}
  \]
  where \( F_Ri \) is the fairness ratio of the \( i \)-th zone (ratio of admitted devices to total devices), and \( m \) is the total number of zones. A higher JFI indicates better fairness.

- **Percentage of Connection Admitted (PCA):**
  PCA is the percentage of devices admitted to the network, where devices are admitted only if the system can offer a minimum bandwidth, as configured by the system designer.

### Mapping the Association Problem to a Max-Flow Problem
A typical network setting can be represented as a flow graph where all APs and zones are nodes. An edge exists between an AP node and a zone node if the AP can contribute bandwidth to that zone, and the edge capacity represents the zone's bandwidth requirement. The objective is to maximize the flow (admittance) of the zone-nodes, making the max-flow problem a natural fit. The problem is reduced to a multiple-source (APs) and multiple-sink (zones) flow problem.

### Modification of Max-Flow
While the standard max-flow algorithm ensures maximum flow, it does not guarantee fairness. To address this, we adapted a four-stage max-flow approach after extensive experimentation. In each stage, every AP aims to utilize a fraction of its capacity: 50%, 75%, 92%, and 100% successively. This modification ensures both fairness and prevents overloading.

## 3. Results
We conducted simulation-based experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed association control protocol compared to traditional RSSI and LLF (Least Load First) approaches. We used the campus of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, India, as a case study.

### Traffic and Mobility Model
We assumed the total number of devices is distributed among zones according to the power law, consistent with recent studies. We also assumed that 60% of the zones would experience movement, with 10% of devices from the originating zone moving to a destination zone. The originating zone was chosen randomly, while popular zones were more likely to be chosen as destinations.

### Benchmark Algorithms
To evaluate our proposed algorithm, we compared its performance with RSSI and LLF. In the RSSI-based algorithm, clients associate with the AP from which they receive the strongest signal. In the LLF approach, clients associate with the AP with the least load.

### Jain's Fairness Index (JFI)
Figure 2 shows that FBA significantly outperforms other schemes in terms of fairness. As the load increases beyond 100%, the fairness of other schemes drops drastically, highlighting the superiority of FBA. Interestingly, JFI does not degrade and sometimes even improves with device movement, as slight movements can move the solution out of local optima.

### Percentage of Connection Admitted (PCA)
Figure 3 confirms that the FBA algorithm also performs better than RSSI and LLF in terms of PCA. Although the gain by FBA over the others is moderate (5%-10% for power law traffic and 7%-14% for uniform traffic), it is achieved in the most viable load region (50%-200%). The PCA does not degrade even when there is some movement.

## 4. Conclusion
This paper combines traditional graph theory with emerging opportunities in wireless settings to address the challenge of association control. Initial results are promising in terms of both admittance and fairness. Future work will focus on addressing issues such as cross-AP interference, channel bit-rate, and mobility/node churn.
