ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a fair association scheme between clients
and APs in WiFi network, exploiting the hybrid nature of
the recent WLAN architecture. We show that such an asso-
ciation outperforms RSSI based schemes in several scenarios,
while remaining practical and scalable for wide-scale deploy-
ment.

INTRODUCTION
Modern wireless networks, specially built for enterprises,
such as airports, universities, and corporate campuses, are
getting multiple APs connected to a central controller through
a high speed wired backbone. The backbone allows for out-
of-band communication among APs, opening up opportuni-
ties for better protocol design for association control beyond
the current method of maximum Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI). This paper focuses on exploiting the hy-
brid nature of such wireless networks for improved client-AP
association. Our proposal combines the information from
multiple APs to augment load-balancing and connection ad-
mittance. Using the wired backbone, APs mutually commu-
nicate the presence of clients within their communication
ranges. Each AP assimilates this global information and di-
vides the network into “exclusive” and “overlapping” zones
(An area covered by a speciﬁc set of APs is called a zone.
A zone is called ‘exclusive’ if it is covered by a single AP,
otherwise it is called an ‘overlapping’ zone.), where clients
located in the exclusive zones must associate to a speciﬁc AP,
while clients in the overlapping zone have a choice among
two or more APs. The APs then collaboratively model the
system as a graph-theoretic max-ﬂow problem, and gener-
ate the optimal client-AP assignment. The assignments are
communicated back to the clients and associations occur ac-
cordingly. Performance improves because the concentration
of clients at speciﬁc hot-spot regions does not overwhelm
a single AP. Instead, clients are distributed among diﬀerent
APs in the neighborhood even if the received signal strength
of their links are relatively weaker.

2. FAIR BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION (FBA)
Basic Protocol: With our scheme, a client temporarily as-
sociates to an AP using RSSI-based association. As a part
of the association process, the client also conveys the IDs
of all APs that it has recently overheard. The AP shares
this information with other APs (over the wired backbone),
thereby learning about the population of clients in diﬀerent
zones around each AP. Using the current distribution of de-
vices, FBA algorithm, which executes periodically, applying
max-ﬂow algorithm ﬁnds a particular client-AP association
conﬁguration.
Metrics: The metrics (J F I and P CA) which are used to
evaluate FBA algorithm is elaborated next.
Jain’s Fairness Index (JFI) is formally deﬁned as
m
m
JFI = (
X
F Ri)2
× (m ×
X
(F Ri)2)−1
(1)
i=1
i=1
where F Ri is the fairness ratio of ith zone (ratio of admit-
ted device and total device), m is the total number of zones.
Higher value of J F I indicates higher fairness.
Percentage of Connection Admitted (PCA) is the per-
centage of devices admitted in the network where devices are
admitted only when the system can oﬀer a minimum band-
width, conﬁgured by the system designer.
Mapping the Association Problem to a Max Flow
Problem: A typical network setting (Fig. 1(a)) can be
represented as a ﬂow graph (Fig. 1(b)) where all the APs
(Ta, Tb) and all the zones (Ea, Sab, Eb) are realized as nodes
in this graph. Edge exists between an AP node and a zone
node if that AP can contribute bandwidth to that zone, and
the edge capacity is representing the requirement of corre-
sponding zone. The objective remains in maximizing the
ﬂow (admittance) of the zone-nodes; hence max ﬂow be-
comes a natural choice. The problem then get reduced to a
multiple source (APs), multiple sink (zones) ﬂow problem.
Modiﬁcation of Max Flow: Max Flow guarantees max-
imum ﬂow (maximum number of device admittance) but
does not ensure equitable distribution of ﬂow (fairness). To
make the allocation fair as well as to restrict overﬂow, we
adapted a four-stage max ﬂow after doing several round of
experimentations. In each stage, every AP targets to utilize
a fraction of its capacity. The fractions are set to 50%, 75%,
92%, 100% successively.

the eﬀectiveness of our proposed association control protocol

over the traditional RSSI based approach and LLF (Least
Load First[1]) based approach. We take the campus of In-
dian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, India as a
case study.
Traﬃc and Mobility Model: We have assumed the
total number of devices is distributed among zones accord-
ing to the power law in line with various recent studies [2].
We have assumed that 60% of the zones will be involved in
movement. For convenience, we have divided these chosen
zones into pairs, whereby 10% of devices from the originat-
ing zone move to the destination zone. The originating zone
is chosen randomly, while a popular zone is more likely to
be chosen as destination.
Benchmark Algorithms: To evaluate the performance of
our proposed algorithm, we compare its performance with
RSSI and LLF. In RSSI based algorithm client associates
itself with AP from which it is getting the strongest signal
and in LLF approach client associates itself with the AP
with least load.
JFI: Fig. 2 shows that FBA is much superior to other
schemes in terms of fairness. When load increases beyond
100%, fairness drops drastically for other schemes, show-
ing FBA’s hence max-ﬂow’s superiority over other ad-hoc
schemes. Interestingly JFI does not degrade (It in fact in-
creases at certain places!) with movement. This happens
as we cannot ensure total optimal fairness through FBA, a
slight movement of devices moves the solution out of local
optima.
Figure 3: Shows admission diﬀerence using diﬀerent
schemes with power law traﬃc, inset (a) shows it
with uniform traﬃc. Inset (b) shows eﬀect of PCA
due to movement on FBA.
PCA: Fig. 3 conﬁrms that FBA algorithm also performs
better than RSSI and LLF in terms of P CA. Though gain
by FBA over the others is moderate (5%-10% -power law,
7%-14% -uniform), but we achieve this diﬀerence in most
viable load region (50%-200%). Inset (b) shows that P CA
does not degrade even when we have some movement.
4. CONCLUSION
This paper combines result from traditional graph theory
with the emerging opportunities in wireless setting to target
the pressing problem of association control. Initial results
are promising both in terms of admittance and fairness. Fu-
ture work is focused on addressing a number of important
issues, including cross-AP interference, channel bit-rate, and
mobility/node churn.
