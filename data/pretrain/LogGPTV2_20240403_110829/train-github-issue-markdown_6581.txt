 **Issue Type:** Bug Report, Regression from #15713
**Component Name:** handlers
**Ansible Version:** 2.2.0.0
**Environment:** OS X 10.11.6
**Summary:** Under Ansible 2.2.0.0, Jinja variables contained in a handler
`name` are no longer populated. Under Ansible 1.9.x and 2.1.1.0, they were
populated. Here's a quick example:
**Steps To Reproduce:**
  1. Write this content to `playbook.yml`:
        ---
    - hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      vars:
        appname: someapp
      handlers:
      # The following line, when the handler is executed, does not populate {{ appname }}
      - name: restart {{ appname }}
        debug:
          msg: some bogus module call in handler {{ appname }}
      tasks:
      - name: bogus task with notify for {{ appname }}
        command: ls
        notify: restart {{ appname }}
  2. Run the playbook: `ansible-playbook --connection=local playbook.yml`
**Expected Results:** In the output of the playbook run, any mention of `{{
appname }}` should not appear, but replaced with `someapp`, per the given
variables.
**Actual Results:**
      [WARNING]: Host file not found: /usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts
     [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available
    PLAY [localhost] ***************************************************************
    TASK [setup] *******************************************************************
    ok: [localhost]
    TASK [bogus task with notify for someapp] **************************************
    changed: [localhost]
    RUNNING HANDLER [restart {{ appname }}] ****************************************
    ok: [localhost] => {
        "msg": "some bogus module call in handler someapp"
    }
    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    localhost                  : ok=3    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0   
Note that in the `RUNNING HANDLER` line, the Jinja template syntax is printed
literally, rather than being populated with the variable that clearly exists,
since it's populated elsewhere. This is a regression from 1.9.x and 2.1.1.0.
