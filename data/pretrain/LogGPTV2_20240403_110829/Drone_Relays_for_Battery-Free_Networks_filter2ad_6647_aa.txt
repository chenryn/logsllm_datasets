## Abstract
Battery-free sensors, such as RFID tags, are widely used in various applications, including pharmaceuticals, clothing, and manufacturing. The primary challenge with these sensors is their limited operational range, typically a few meters. This limitation hinders the effectiveness of current systems for communication and localization.

To address this issue, we introduce RFly, a system that utilizes drones as relays for battery-free networks. RFly introduces two key innovations: the first full-duplex relay for battery-free networks and the first RF-localization algorithm that can operate through a mobile relay. The relay seamlessly integrates with existing RFID infrastructure, preserving phase and timing characteristics of forwarded packets. 

We developed a hardware prototype of RFlyâ€™s relay, integrating it into a custom PCB circuit and mounting it on a Parrot Bebop drone. Our experimental evaluation shows that RFly enables communication with commercial RFID tags at distances over 50 meters, with a median localization accuracy of 19 centimeters. These results demonstrate that RFly provides powerful tools for communication and localization in battery-free networks.

## 1. Introduction
The largest and fastest-growing market for networked devices by unit sales consists of passive RFID (Radio Frequency Identifier) tags. In 2016 alone, over 5 billion RFID tags were sold, with the market size exceeding $16 billion [33]. The primary use of RFID tags is to identify and track objects in factories, warehouses, or supply chains. Passive RFID tags are battery-free stickers attached to objects, similar to barcodes. When queried by a wireless reader, RFID tags respond with their unique IDs, allowing the reader to identify them from a distance.

However, passive RFID technology is only reliable at distances of a few meters [42, 47, 50] due to the difficulty in reliably powering RFID tags at longer distances. This range decreases further if the tag is obscured, such as under a stack of clothes in a retail store. Even with a dense infrastructure of RFID readers, 20-80% of RFID tags may remain in blind spots due to destructive interference or orientation misalignment [31]. Consequently, inventory control in warehouses often requires employees to manually scan the entire area, a process that can take up to a month [34].

Recent efforts have explored alternatives like vision-based systems, such as imaging drones tested by Walmart and Amazon Go [34, 43]. However, these systems are limited to line-of-sight operation, which is problematic for localizing items in non-line-of-sight settings.

In this paper, we present RFly, a system that combines the agility of drones with the sensing capabilities of RF signals, enabling drones to detect and localize objects in non-line-of-sight environments over a wide area. RFly introduces a new relay technology designed for battery-free networks. The relay seamlessly integrates with existing RFID infrastructure, extending the range and eliminating blind spots.

RFly's relay must satisfy three key properties:
1. **Bidirectionally Full-Duplex:** The relay must support four concurrent wireless transmissions to enable backscatter communication.
2. **Phase and Timing Preservation:** The relay must preserve the phase and timing characteristics of forwarded packets, which are essential for accurate localization.
3. **Compact Design:** The relay must be compact enough to be mounted on a drone.

To achieve these properties, RFly's relay uses a mirrored architecture with self-interference cancellation and phase offset compensation. This allows the reader to capture the phase of the RFID response through the relay, enabling localization.

RFly's solution to the phase entanglement challenge involves embedding an RFID tag into the relay itself. This allows it to isolate and process each half-link independently, enabling standard antenna array equations for localization.

We built a prototype of RFly, implementing the relay on a custom PCB circuit mounted on a Parrot Bebop2 drone. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that RFly significantly extends the read range and achieves high localization accuracy.

## 2. Primer on Passive RFID Communication
Passive RFID tags communicate with a device called a reader. The reader initiates communication by sending a query on the downlink channel, which powers up the tag and communicates messages. The powered-up tag responds with its unique identifier using ON-OFF keying modulation by switching its internal impedance between reflective and non-reflective states.

State-of-the-art localization techniques [32, 45, 46] use the phase of the received tag response to encode distance information. Specifically, after transmitting a query, the reader sends a continuous wave at frequency \( f \):

\[ x(t) = e^{j2\pi f t} \]

The RFID tag modulates this wave with a signal \( s(t) \), and the received signal at the reader is:

\[ y(t) = s(t) e^{j2\pi f (t - \frac{2d}{c})} \]

where \( 2d \) is the round-trip distance and \( c \) is the speed of light. The reader can recover the phase \( \phi = \frac{4\pi d}{c} \) and use it for localization.

The communication range is limited on the downlink channel because the reader must deliver sufficient power and modulation depth to the RFID tag, typically around -15 dBm for off-the-shelf tags [12], limiting the reliable range to 3-6 meters [12, 42].

## 3. RFly Overview
RFly is a system that leverages drones as relays for UHF RFID networks, enabling the detection and localization of RFID tags at distances much larger than the typical read range. RFly works in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight environments, making it suitable for highly cluttered areas like warehouses, stores, and factories.

To localize objects, RFly dispatches a drone that follows a predetermined flight plan. The drone carries an on-board RFID relay, which acts as a transparent intermediary between RFID readers and RFID tags. As the drone flies, the relay continuously forwards uplink and downlink traffic, preserving localization-sensitive characteristics of the signal.

The RFID reader collects responses through the relay, decodes the responses to identify the RFID tags' unique IDs, and synthesizes the measurements collected along the drone's trajectory to localize the tags. Finally, the system uses a local database to map each RFID's unique ID to the object it is attached to, typically provided by the manufacturer [1].

## Contributions
- We present the first system that leverages drones as relays for battery-free networks, enabling the detection and localization of objects in non-line-of-sight settings over a wide area.
- We design and build the first phase-preserving and bidirectionally full-duplex relay.
- We introduce a new localization algorithm that operates on RF signals obtained through a mobile relay.
- We present a prototype implementation of our system, demonstrating its accuracy and range of operation.

RFly has some limitations, such as reliance on vision-based systems for navigation and a localization range limited to tens of meters. We believe these limitations can be addressed as research evolves, and we hope RFly's design motivates new systems that synergize drone technologies with RF capabilities and battery-free networks.
