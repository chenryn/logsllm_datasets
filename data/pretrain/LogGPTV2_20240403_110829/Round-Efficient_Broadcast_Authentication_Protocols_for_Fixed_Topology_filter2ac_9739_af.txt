This reasoning is shown in Figure 9. For base cases, we note
that, for any x, T (x, 0) = 1 (a height bound of 0 does not
allow the original node to disseminate to any other node) and
T (0, x) = 1 (with 0 rounds, no dissemination takes place).
We can now consider the maximum number of nodes
reachable from a max-depth leaf vertex u within t rounds.
The argument is illustrated in Figure 8. The ﬁgure shows
is i
the nodes between u and the root r. The node ui
levels above u. It can be reached no earlier than at round
i. Thus, ui has t − i rounds remaining to disseminate into
its subtree. Since u is a node at maximum depth in the tree,
the subtree rooted at ui has a height bound of i. Hence, the
maximum number of nodes reached from ui is T (t − i, i).
A bound on the total number of nodes reachable from u in t
T (t−i, i). Using the recurrence
rounds is thus F (t) =
T (t, h) = T (t− 1, h) + T (t− 1, h− 1) we can expand F (t)
(cid:3)t
i=0
as follows:
t(cid:4)
F (t) =

By substituting F (cid:2)(t) = F (t) + 1, we can see that F (cid:2)(t) =
F (cid:2)(t − 1) + F (cid:2)(t − 2) yielding a Fibonacci series. From
the base cases F (0) = 1, F (1) = 2 we can show F (t) =
Fib(t + 3)−1 where Fib(x) is the xth number in the standard
√
Fibonacci series. From Binet’s formula, Fib(x) ≤ (cid:2)φx/

ROUND COMPLEXITY AND CONGESTION BOUNDS OF OUR PROTOCOLS.

VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
A summary of the results presented in this paper is
presented in Table I. The new protocols avoid the high
computation overhead of digital signatures and the high
communication overhead of one-time signatures and multi-
receiver MACs, as well as the time synchronization needed
by TESLA. In terms of round complexity and commu-
nication congestion, our protocols provide points in the
design space that are not achievable by previously published
protocols. In particular, for the linear topology, the hash
tree scheme achieves the fastest possible round complexity
n with only O(log n) congestion; the hash chain scheme
achieves constant congestion with only 2n round complexity.
the hash tree scheme
For the fully connected topology,
requires at most 2(cid:2)log n(cid:3) + 1 round complexity with only
O(log n) congestion; since we also show that this is the
fastest possible round complexity achievable for schemes
with polylogarithmic congestion, this also functions as an
existence proof that the 2 log n bound is asymptotically tight
on the coefﬁcient of log n for the full-duplex communication
model. Our optimizations do not signiﬁcantly increase the
per-round communication cost.
The other main contribution of this paper is in show-
ing previously uninvestigated round complexity bounds for
symmetric-key-based broadcast authentication in fully con-
nected and tree topologies. We show a tight round com-
plexity bound of 2 log n rounds for broadcast authentication
schemes with polylogarithmic congestion in any topology
and another round complexity lower bound of 2.44 log n −
2.33 rounds for trees. These lower bounds show the funda-
mental round complexity limitations of broadcast authentica-
tion protocols, and can inform the design constraints of new
authentication protocols in networks. The new bounds also
signiﬁcantly extend the relevance of the result on multicast
message authentication by Boneh, Durfee and Franklin [18].
The previous result applied only to static authentication
codes and did not address protocols involving multiple
interactions between receivers, which are in fact the primary
methods of multicast message authentication in practice. In
our proofs of round complexity lower bounds, we greatly
improve the relevance of this result by showing how it can
be extended to apply to general authentication protocols by
considering round complexity. This signiﬁcantly expands the
existing level of understanding about the fundamental limits
in signature-free multicast authentication.
