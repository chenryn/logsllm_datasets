Abstract 
Proxy networks have been proposed to protect applications from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.  However, since 
large-scale study in real networks is infeasible and most previous simulations have failed to capture detailed network 
behavior, the DoS resilience and performance implications of such use are not well understood in large networks. 
While post-mortems of actual large-scale attacks are useful, only limited dynamic behavior can be understood from
these single instances.  Our work provides the first detailed and broad study of this problem in large-scale realistic
networks.    The  key  is  that  we  use  an online  network simulator  to  simulate  a  realistic  large-scale  network
(comparable to several large ISPs).  We use a generic proxy network, and deploy it in a large simulated network
using  typical  real  applications  and DoS  tools  directly. We  study detailed  system  dynamics  under various  attack
scenarios  and  proxy  network  configurations.    Specific  results  are  as  follows.    First, rather  than  incurring  a 
performance penalty, proxy networks can improve usersí experienced performance.  Second, proxy networks can
effectively mitigate the impact of both spread and concentrated large-scale DoS attacks in large networks.  Third,
proxy networks provide scalable DoS-resilience ñ resilience can be scaled up to meet the size of the attack, enabling
application performance to be protected.  Resilience increases almost linearly with the size of a proxy network; that
is,  the  attack  traffic  that  a  given  proxy  network  can  resist,  while  preserving  a  particular  level  of  application
performance, grows almost linearly with proxy network size.  These results provide empirical evidence that proxy 
networks can be used to tolerate DoS attacks and quantitative guidelines for designing a proxy network to meet a 
resilience goal. 
1 Introduction
Denial-of-Service  (DoS)  attacks  continue  to  be  key 
threat  to  Internet  applications. 
  In  such  attacks, 
especially  distributed  DoS  attacks,  a  set  of  attackers
generates  a  huge  amount of  traffic,  saturating  the
victimís  network,  and  causing  significant  damage. 
Overlay  networks 1 have  been  proposed  to  protect
applications  against  such DoS  attacks  [1-7]  .    These
overlay networks are also known as proxy networks [6,
8].    The  key  idea  is  to  hide  the  application  behind  a
proxy network, using the proxy network to mediate all 
communication  between  users  and  the  application, 
thereby preventing direct attacks on the application.   
Realistic study of these approaches should involve large 
networks, real applications, and real attacks.  To date, 
however, studies of these approaches have been limited 
to  theoretical analysis  and small-scale  experiments  [1-
7], which cannot capture the complex system dynamics,
including  packet  drops,  router  queues,  temporal  and 
feedback behavior of network and application protocols 
during  DoS  attacks.    These  factors  are  critical  to  the 
application and proxy network performance in the face 
of DoS attacks.  Thus, we still do not have answers to 
many key questions about the viability and properties of 
these  proxy  approaches. 
  Specifically,  with  real 
complex network structures and protocol behavior, can
proxy  networks  tolerate  DoS  attacks?   If so,  what  are 
the  key  parameters  to achieve  effective  and  efficient 
resilience?    If  we  use  proxy  networks,  what  are  the 
performance implications for applications?
Our  approach  exploits  the  recent  availability  of  a 
detailed 
large-scale  online  network  simulator  ñ 
MicroGrid [9, 10] ñ to study proxy networks with real
applications and real DoS attacks.  MicroGrid supports 
detailed packet-level  simulation  of  large  networks  and
use  of  unmodified  applications. With  MicroGrid,  we
are able to make detailed performance studies in large

The intuition that indirection reduces performance turns
out to be incorrect, as the improved TCP performance 
more than compensates. 
Proxy networks can effectively mitigate the impact

of both spread and concentrated large-scale DoS attacks
in  large  network  environment.    Our  experiments  have
shown  that  a  192-node  proxy  network with  64  edge
proxies  (each  connected  by  a  100Mbps  uplink),  can 
successfully  resist  a  range  of  large-scale distributed
DoS attacks with up to 6.0Gbps aggregated traffic and 
different attack load distribution; most users (>90%) do
not  experience  significant performance  degradation
under these attack scenarios.

resilience  can  be  scaled up  to  meet  the  size  of  the

to  be

size of a proxy network; that is, the attack traffic that a 
given  proxy network  can  resist,  while  preserving  a

almost linearly with proxy network size.  
These  results  provide  empirical  evidence that  proxy
networks  can  be  used  to tolerate  DoS  attacks  and
quantitative guidelines for designing a proxy network to

Our  main  contributions  are  the  following.    First,  we 
provide the first large-scale empirical study on the DoS

applications  and  real  attacks;  this  is  a  qualitative 
advance  over  previous  studies  based on  theoretical
models  and  small  scale  experiments.    Second,  we 
provide the first set of empirical evidence on large-scale
network  environment  to  prove  that  proxy  networks
have  effective  and  scalable  resilience  against  DoS
attacks.    Third, we  provide  a  detailed  performance

the  applications
There  are  two  classes  of  DoS  attacks: infrastructure-
level and application-level attacks.  Infrastructure-level
attacks  directly  attack  the  resources  of  the  service
infrastructure,  such as  the  networks and  hosts  of the 
application services; for example, attackers send floods
of network  traffic  to saturate  the  target  network.    In 
contrast,  application-level attacks  are 
the
application  interface;  for  example,  attackers  overload
an  application  by  sending it  abusive  workload,  or 
malicious requests which crash the application. 
through 
Infrastructure-level  DoS  attacks  only  require 
the
knowledge  of  applicationsí  network  address,  i.e.  IP
address.  Meanwhile, application-level DoS attacks are 
application-specific,  and do  not  require  the  target
applicationís IP address. 
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are large-
scale  DoS  attacks  which  employ  a  large  number  of
attackers distributed across the network.  There are two 
stages  in  such  attacks.
  First,  attackers build  large 
zombie  networks  by  compromising  many  Internet
hosts,  and  installing  a  zombie  program  on  each.
Second,  attackers  activate  this  large  zombie  network,
directing  them  to  ìDoSî  a  target.    Both  infrastructure
and application-level DoS attacks can be used in stage 
two. Automated DDoS toolkits, such as Trinoo, TFN2k
and  mstream [11-13],  and  worms,  such  as CodeRed
[14,  15], provide  automation,  enabling  large  scale 
attacks to be easily constructed.
This paper  focuses  on  infrastructure-level  distributed
DoS attacks.  In the rest of the paper, DoS attacks refer
to  infrastructure-level  distributed  DoS  attacks  unless
indicated otherwise. 
2.2 Proxy Network Approach 
Proxy networks  have  been  proposed  as  a  means  to
protect applications from DoS attacks [1-4, 7].  Figure 3
illustrates a generic proxy network encompassing most 
of  the  proposed  approaches  [1-4,  7].    As  shown  in
Figure 3, an overlay network, known as proxy network, 
is used to mediate all communication between users and
the  application. As  long as  the  mediation  can  be
enforced, the proxy network is the only public interface 
for  the  application,  and  the  application  cannot  be
directly  attacked.    Meanwhile  a  large  set  of  proxies, 
known  as  edge  proxies,  publish  their  IP  addresses,
providing  application  access.    The  number  of  edge
proxies can be flexibly increased.  This allows scalable
resilience  against  DoS  attacks  on  edge proxies,  and
thereby allows a proxy network to shield the application
from  DoS  attacks.    Using  this  generic  proxy  network
model,  we  study  the  fundamental  capabilities  and
limitations of a wide range of proxy networks.

A
s discussed  above,  a  proxy  network  must  have  two 
key  capabilities  to  successfully  protect  applications 
from DoS attacks. First, a proxy network must enforce
mediation  so  that  the  application  can only be  reached
via  the  proxy  network, thereby  preventing  direct  DoS
attacks  on  the  application.    Second,  a  proxy  network 
must  provide  DoS-resilience  mediation  so  that  it  can
support continued user access to the application under 
DoS attacks.
Mechanisms to enforce proxy network mediation have
been  proposed  and  studied.    As  shown  in [6,  8],  it  is 
feasible to hide an applicationí IP address using a proxy 
network,  thereby  enforcing  proxy  network mediation. 
Additionally, some proxy network schemes [1, 3, 5, 7]
also studied slightly different mechanisms for enforcing
mediation.
For  example,  SOS  [1,  7]  uses  filters
combined with secret servlets to enforce all application
access being mediated through the SOS network.   
In  this paper, we  assume  mediation  can  be  enforced,
and  direct  DoS  attacks on 
the  application  are
impossible.  We focus on the DoS-resilience capability
of proxy networks, and study how well a proxy network
can  protect  user-experienced  application  performance
under DoS attacks on edge proxies.
