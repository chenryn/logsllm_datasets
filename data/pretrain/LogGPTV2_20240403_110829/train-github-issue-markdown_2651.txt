### Issue Report: Silent Application Exit with Electron 0.37.7

**Electron Version:** 0.37.7  
**Operating Systems:** Windows 64, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 15.10

#### Problem Description
An application packaged with Electron 0.37.7 is experiencing an issue where it silently quits before the window is displayed. This behavior has been observed on multiple operating systems, including Windows 64 and Ubuntu 14.04/15.10.

#### Cause
Using a debugger on an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine, we identified that the `app.makeSingleInstance` function in the `main.js` file returns `true` even for the first instance of the program. This issue occurs only on machines where the application has never been run or "installed" before.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Package the application with Electron 0.37.7.
2. Run the application on a machine where it has not been run before.
3. Observe that the application exits silently without displaying the window.

#### Temporary Workaround
- **Downgrade to Electron 0.37.6**: Re-packaging the application with Electron 0.37.6 resolves the issue, and the application starts up correctly.
- **Upgrade to Electron 0.37.7 Again**: After downgrading and then upgrading back to 0.37.7, the problem does not reappear. This suggests that the issue is related to the initial state of the machine and not the version itself.

#### Additional Observations
- The problem does not manifest on development machines or older machines that have previously used the application packaged with lower versions of Electron.
- The issue persists even in a very simple test application with an empty main page and almost empty `main.js`.

#### Questions
- Has anyone else encountered this issue with Electron 0.37.7?
- Are there any known changes in `app.makeSingleInstance` between Electron 0.37.6 and 0.37.7 that could explain this behavior?
- What are the best practices to ensure consistent behavior across different machines and Electron versions?

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
