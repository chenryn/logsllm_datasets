  * Electron version: 0.37.7
  * Operating system: Windows 64, Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10
One of the application of us packaged with electron 0.37.7 will quit silently
before seeing the window when run. The cause is found, using debugger on a
ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine, to be `app.makeSingleInstance` in the main.js
file returns true even for the first instance of the program. All the machines
having the problem had not run (or "installed") the program before. After down
grade to 0.37.6 and re-package, the program startup OK and the problem
disappears. Then, after upgrade to 0.37.7 again the problem also does not re-
appear (due to this reason, it never manifests on our development machine and
other old machines having used the program packaged with lower versions of
electron). It is found that the problem is still there even for a very simple
probram with empty main page and almost empty main.js.
Any ideas?
