### Title: Black Hat US-19: Rough and Ready: Frameworks to Measure Persistent Engagement and Deterrence

The United States is currently undergoing a significant policy shift, focusing on forward defense and deterrence to "intercept and halt" adversary cyber operations. Proponents of this approach argue that these measures will substantially reduce attacks against the U.S., while critics express concern that such actions may, in fact, provoke more aggressive behavior from adversaries. Currently, there is no standardized methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of these policies.

In this talk, we present recent research aimed at introducing transparent frameworks to better assess whether the new U.S. policy and actions are effectively suppressing or inadvertently encouraging cyber attacks. These frameworks provide a structured approach to measure the impact of persistent engagement and deterrence strategies, offering valuable insights for policymakers and cybersecurity professionals.
