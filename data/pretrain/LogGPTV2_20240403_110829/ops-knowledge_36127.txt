### Intermittent IIS Connection Close Issue

I am experiencing an intermittent issue with a website running on IIS. Most of the time, the site functions correctly, but occasionally, I encounter a white 404 page with the following text:

```
Not Found
HTTP Error 404. The requested resource is not found.
```

When using Fiddler to inspect the HTTP headers, I observe the following for the 404 response:

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii
Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
Date: Thu, 10 Nov 2011 21:25:01 GMT
Connection: close
Content-Length: 315
```

This suggests that a "connection close" error is occurring intermittently.

After a few refreshes, the page loads successfully, and the headers are as follows:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Last-Modified: Thu, 10 Nov 2011 15:53:56 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes
ETag: "02d1f3c09fcc1:0"
Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
mycustomheader: 01
Date: Thu, 10 Nov 2011 21:25:24 GMT
Content-Length: 16307
```

I have noticed that the 404 response does not include a custom HTTP header (`mycustomheader`) that I added as part of my debugging steps. Shouldn't this custom header be present in the 404 response if it is being served by the same web application?

Could anyone provide insights into why certain HTTP requests are intermittently closed by IIS?

Thank you,

Ed
