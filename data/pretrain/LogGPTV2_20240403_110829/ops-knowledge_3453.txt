User:  Please explain the commonly used relational databases and non-relational databases, and compare their advantages and disadvantages by category.
Assistant: Relational and non-relational databases are two different types of databases. A relational database is a database based on a relational model. Its data is organized in the form of tables, and each table has a fixed structure. Relational databases are operated using Structured Query Language (SQL), and support transaction processing and compound queries. Common relational databases include MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. Advantages: structured data, high data consistency; support transaction processing, with data integrity; support complex queries and mathematical operations; small data storage space, high data index efficiency. Disadvantages: It is difficult to expand, and the table structure needs to be designed; the scalability is poor, and it is suitable for systems that process a small amount of data; the high-concurrency read and write performance is poor. A non-relational database is a database without a fixed structure. Common models include key-value (Key-value), document (Document), column storage (Columnar), and graph (Graph). Non-relational databases store data through key-value, do not support SQL language, but use special query language or API to operate. Common non-relational databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, etc. Advantages: strong scalability, can be smoothly extended to multiple machines for data storage; high performance, suitable for high concurrency scenarios; high flexibility, supporting the processing of different data models. Disadvantages: The degree of data structure is low, and data abstraction and design are required; data consistency may be low; no transaction processing mechanism is provided; complex queries and mathematical operations are not supported. In summary, relational databases are suitable for scenarios that require strong consistency, complex queries, and support for transaction processing; non-relational databases are suitable for scenarios that require high performance, high scalability, and strong flexibility. Which database to use depends on the actual situation.
