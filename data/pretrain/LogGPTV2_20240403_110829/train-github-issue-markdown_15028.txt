At the moment compiler insists on having valid identifier on right side of
`typeof` so following code is not valid:
    var x : typeof (1+ 2);
    var y : typeof this;
even though it's possible to assign the expression to variable and then
capture the type form that:
    var x_ = 1+2;
    var x = typeof x;
    var y_ = this;
    var y = typeof y_;
I propose to allow capturing type of any valid expression. The expression
itself wouldn't be evaluated.
