Πa = ˆΠa, as deﬁned below, if a is honest, or (2) the set of all
possible programs only limited by the network conﬁguration, i.e.
Πa = Proc(In(a),Out(a),Na), if a is not assumed to be honest.
Now, we deﬁne the sets of honest programs of the participants. We
provide here only high-level description of these programs. It is,
however, straightforward (although tedious) to encode these pro-
grams formally as atomic processes, as deﬁned in the previous sec-
tion.
The scheduler: As we have mentioned, chinit is an input channel
of S and, hence, in every instance of the protocol, the processes
of the scheduler is the master (atomic) process. The role of the
scheduler, as we have also mentioned, is to to trigger every party,
so that it is given a chance to perform the actions required by the
protocol.
The set of honest programs ˆΠS of the scheduler contains all the
processes π deﬁned as follows. A process π ∈ ˆΠS sends two kind
of messages to protocol participants (using the channels chS
a, for
a ∈ Σ): the message trigger and messages t0,t1,t2, . . . (time mes-
sages). Exactly one message is sent every time π is invoked by de-
livering (chinit : init), which, by fairness, happens an inﬁnite num-
ber of times. The order of messages sent to different participants is
not restricted (different processes in ˆΠS have different order corre-
sponding to different scheduling), except for the following require-
ment: (1) for every i, the message ti is sent exactly once to every
protocol participant and (2) if i  1, have the same value c and A
(c) as required in V2.

Hence, by the deﬁnition of the judging procedure, V states ψ =
ψ∗
{A,Bi1 ,...,Bil }. To prove that ψ is true in π, it is enough to show that
if one of A,Bi1 , . . . ,Bil is honest, then the remaining ones are not
honest in π.
First, suppose that A is honest in π. Then, A does not reveal the
value of c before time T1. Therefore, every bidder in {Bi1 , . . . ,Bil}
must have either revealed her own commitment or submitted some-
body else’s commitment. In both cases the bidder is not honest.

Now, suppose that one of the bidders, say Bi1 is honest. Because
