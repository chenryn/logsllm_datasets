I have a question regarding my C# application. I need to determine the free space of a directory, and based on my research, `GetDiskFreeSpaceEx` seems to be the appropriate method. This function works well for me on Windows XP. However, I am now wondering if it will work the same way on a Linux system.

I initially wrote my C# program by referencing a Python script. In that script, the developer used two different methods depending on the operating system: 
- For Windows, `ctypes.windll.kernel32.GetDiskFreeSpaceExW` is used.
- For other systems (presumably including Linux), `os.statvfs(folder)` is used.

I have done some additional research but haven't found any information confirming whether `GetDiskFreeSpaceEx` can be used on Linux. Can anyone confirm if this is possible? If not, are there any alternative methods to get the free disk space on a Linux system using C#?

Thank you in advance!

**Assistant's Response:**

For Linux, you can use the `Statvfs` method available in the `Mono.Unix.Native` namespace, which is part of the `Mono.Posix` assembly. This method provides similar functionality to `os.statvfs` in Python and should work well for your needs.
