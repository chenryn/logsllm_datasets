User: I have a question. In my c# application I need to get the free space of a directory. According to my research, GetdiskfreespaceEx is proper and it works for me in my windows xp. Now I'm wondering if it works the same in a linux system. Since I wrote my c# program according to a python one, and for this function the developer of the python one made 2 cases: the windows os or else. For the windows case                        "ctypes.windll.kernel32.GetDiskFreeSpaceExW" is used while in else case "os.statvfs(folder)" is used.
I did some more research but haven't found anything saying if GetdiskfreespaceEx could be used for linux. Anyone could tell me that? If no, any ways to get free disk space for linux in c#? Thanks in advance!
Assistant: For Linux you will find Statvfs in Mono.Unix.Native, in the Mono.Posix assembly.
