Assistant: You can use the following methods to monitor server performance indicators: 1. Use the commands that come with the system: such as top, htop and other commands to view indicators such as CPU, memory, and disk; iostat, sar and other commands to view indicators such as disk IO and network traffic. 2. Use third-party monitoring tools: monitoring tools such as Zabbix, Nagios, and Cacti can monitor various indicators of the server in real time, and can also send alarms through emails and text messages. 3. Use the monitoring services of cloud service providers: For example, Alibaba Cloud, AWS and other cloud service providers provide monitoring services, which can easily monitor and manage various indicators of the server. 4. Use open source performance monitoring tools: For example, open source tools such as Prometheus and Grafana can monitor various indicators of the server, and provide visual reporting and alarm functions, which is convenient for managers to monitor and manage.
