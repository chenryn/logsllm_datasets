User: How to protect corporate website from DDoS attack? Please list commonly used defensive measures and tools.
Assistant: The commonly used defensive measures and tools are as follows: 1. Increase bandwidth and hardware resources: Increasing bandwidth and hardware resources is one of the most basic means of defending against DDoS attacks. It can increase the processing capacity of enterprise systems and thus resist some attacks. 2. Firewall: The firewall can identify and filter malicious data packets, but because the traffic of DDoS attacks is very large, the role of the firewall is greatly weakened. 3. CDN (Content Distribution Network): CDN is a distributed server system that can cache static and dynamic resources on CDN nodes, thereby dispersing attack traffic and mitigating the impact of attacks. 4. WAF (Web Application Firewall): WAF can monitor and filter HTTP requests and responses, and can effectively prevent some common attack methods, such as SQL injection and XSS attacks. 5. IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention System): IDS/IPS can detect and prevent attacks, but its role will also be limited by DDoS attack traffic. 6. Load balancing: Load balancing can distribute traffic to multiple servers, thereby increasing system processing capacity and mitigating the impact of attacks. 7. Third-party protection services: Some enterprises can choose to purchase third-party DDoS protection services. These service providers have strong defense capabilities and can help enterprises resist large-scale DDoS attacks.
