**User:** I'm experiencing a frustrating issue with my Python installation. Despite searching the web for solutions, the only advice I've found is to modify the PATH variable, which I have already done. My Python 2.7 (32-bit) is installed in `C:\Python27`. However, when I type `python` in the command prompt, it returns an error stating that it is not recognized as an internal or external command. My current PATH variable includes `C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\;C:\Python27\Scripts`. I am running Windows 7 (64-bit). I am at a loss and would greatly appreciate any suggestions. If nothing works, I might consider dual-booting Linux and Windows 7.

**Assistant:** A quick, though not necessarily elegant or long-term, solution to get you up and running is to copy the `python.exe` file from your Python installation directory (`C:\Python27`) into the directory where you are trying to run it. This worked for me, and it might help you bypass the PATH issue temporarily.
