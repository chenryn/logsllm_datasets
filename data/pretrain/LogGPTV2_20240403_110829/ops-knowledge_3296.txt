User: This is a really annoying problem. I've prowled the web for solutions, but all I found was tips about changing the PATH variable, which I did, of course. My Python install directory is C:\Python27. It' a 32 bit version. Whenever I type python in the command prompt, it says that it isn't recognised as an internal or external command. Currently, my PATH variable is set to C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\;C:\Python27\Scripts. Anyone has any ideas? I run Windows 7 by the way (64 bit). I'm pretty desperate. Heck, if nothing works I guess I'll try dual-booting Linux and Windows 7...
Assistant: Quick fix: May not be the most elegant or long term fix but if you are really frustrated and just want to get it to run, just copy paste the python.exe file to your current directory. This worked for me.
