User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is there any log in SuSe Linux that tells if a machine hangs due to a runaway? I have a SuSe Linux server that is hanging due to unknown issues, I'm to the point of wondering whether there is a runaway process being run every now and then that is causing it to hang.

The issue is that I don't know where to look for it after the hang happens... (I don't want to spend a whole day looking at top to find a runaway) -so my question is this: is there any log in SuSe that logs runaways? If not, is there a way to log such things?

Thanks a lot!

Assistant: More information would help. How are you defining "hang"? Assuming you have physical access to the server, you can check to see which kernel messages appear on screen following the hang. Does the server require a reboot after it stalls? 

You can trace the normal system logs up to the point of the crash in /var/log/messages. If you have an open session when the server stalls, look at the driver messages by running dmesg.

Do you have any details on the hardware? If this is server-grade hardware, you may be able to check the system's hardware logs to see if there's an issue like bad RAM, etc.
