## Abstract
With the increasing demand for higher reliability in clusters and data centers, RAID-6 has gained popularity due to its ability to tolerate the concurrent failure of any two disks. Among various implementations of erasure codes in RAID-6, Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes aim to provide optimal storage efficiency and data protection. However, these MDS codes, which use either horizontal or diagonal/anti-diagonal parities, often suffer from unbalanced I/O, leading to low performance and reliability. To address this issue, we propose a new parity called Horizontal-Diagonal Parity (HDP), which combines the advantages of both horizontal and diagonal/anti-diagonal parities. The corresponding MDS code, HDP Code, distributes parity elements uniformly across all disks, thereby balancing I/O workloads and improving recovery speed during single or double disk failures. Our analysis demonstrates that HDP Code provides better I/O load balancing and higher reliability compared to other popular MDS codes.

## I. Introduction
Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive (or Independent) Disks (RAID) have become a popular choice for providing high-reliability and high-performance storage services at an acceptable cost. With the increasing likelihood of multiple disk failures in large storage systems, RAID-6 has received significant attention due to its ability to tolerate the simultaneous failure of any two disks.

There are many implementations of RAID-6 based on various erasure coding technologies, with Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes being particularly popular. MDS codes offer protection against disk failures with a given amount of redundancy. These codes can be categorized into horizontal codes and vertical codes. Horizontal codes, such as EVENODD and RDP, typically consist of \( m + 2 \) disk drives, where the first \( m \) disks store original data and the last two are used for parity. Vertical codes, such as X-Code, Cyclic code, and P-Code, disperse the parity across all disk drives. However, most MDS codes suffer from unbalanced I/O, especially in write-intensive applications, which reduces reconstruction performance during single or double disk failures.

To address these issues, we propose a new parity called Horizontal-Diagonal Parity (HDP), which leverages both horizontal and diagonal/anti-diagonal parities to achieve balanced I/O. The corresponding code, HDP Code, distributes parity elements evenly across all disks, ensuring balanced I/O and high reliability.

## II. Problems of Existing MDS Codes and Motivations of Our Work
To improve the efficiency, performance, and reliability of RAID-6 storage systems, various MDS coding approaches have been proposed. However, these approaches often suffer from unbalanced I/O and high recovery costs for single disk failures. In this section, we discuss the problems of existing MDS codes and the motivations for our work.

### A. Load Balancing Problem in Existing MDS Codes
RAID-5 maintains good load balancing using the parity declustering approach. However, in RAID-6, load balancing is a significant challenge, especially in horizontal codes. For example, in RDP, the dedicated distribution of parities leads to unbalanced I/O. Figure 1 illustrates the load balancing problem in RDP, where the number of I/O operations in columns 6 and 7 is significantly higher than in other columns, leading to a sharp decrease in system performance and reliability.

Vertical codes like P-Code also suffer from unbalanced I/O due to unevenly distributed parities. Figure 2 shows the load balancing problem in P-Code, where column 6 has very low workload while column 0 has a very high workload, again leading to decreased performance and reliability.

Dynamic load balancing approaches, while effective in some cases, struggle to handle the high workload in parity disks and the override on data disks in RAID-6 systems. Static parity placement, as used in industrial products like EMC CLARiiON, also has additional overhead and suffers from unbalanced I/O within each stripe.

### B. Reducing I/O Cost of Single Disk Failure
In 2010, Xiang et al. proposed a hybrid recovery approach called RDOR, which uses both horizontal and diagonal parities to recover single disk failures. This method minimizes I/O cost and achieves balanced I/O on disks except for the failed one. However, RDOR is less effective for vertical codes like X-Code and cannot reduce I/O cost when a parity disk fails.

### C. Summary of Different Parities in Various Coding Methods
To understand the root cause of unbalanced I/O in MDS coding approaches, we analyze the features of different parities. We classify these approaches into four categories: horizontal parity, diagonal/anti-diagonal parity, vertical parity, and horizontal-diagonal parity (HDP).

1. **Horizontal Parity (HP)**: HP is a key feature of horizontal codes like EVENODD and RDP. The horizontal parity layout is shown in Figure 1(a) and can be calculated using XOR operations. For partial stripe writes, HP can be more efficient due to shared computations.

2. **Diagonal/Anti-diagonal Parity**: These parities are used in codes like RDP and X-Code. They help in recovering data but can lead to unbalanced I/O if not distributed evenly.

3. **Vertical Parity**: Vertical codes like X-Code, Cyclic code, and P-Code disperse parity across all disks. While they can balance I/O, they often have high recovery costs for single disk failures.

4. **Horizontal-Diagonal Parity (HDP)**: HDP combines the advantages of both horizontal and diagonal/anti-diagonal parities to achieve balanced I/O and high reliability.

## III. HDP Code Description
HDP Code is designed to distribute parity elements uniformly across all disks, ensuring balanced I/O and high reliability. The detailed structure and computation of HDP Code will be discussed in this section.

## IV. Load Balancing Analysis
We conduct a series of quantitative analyses to evaluate the load balancing performance of HDP Code. The results show that HDP Code achieves better load balancing compared to other existing coding methods.

## V. Reliability Analysis
We also perform reliability analysis to demonstrate the improved recovery speed and higher reliability of HDP Code during single and double disk failures.

## VI. Related Work
This section provides an overview of related work in the field of RAID-6 and MDS codes, highlighting the contributions and limitations of existing approaches.

## VII. Conclusion
In conclusion, we propose a novel and efficient XOR-based RAID-6 code called HDP Code, which offers optimal storage efficiency, balanced I/O, and high reliability. Our analysis shows that HDP Code outperforms other existing MDS codes in terms of load balancing and reliability. Future work will focus on further optimizing HDP Code and exploring its applications in various storage systems.
