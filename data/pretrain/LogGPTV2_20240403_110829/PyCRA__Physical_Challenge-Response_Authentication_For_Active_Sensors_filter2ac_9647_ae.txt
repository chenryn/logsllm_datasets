example, the work reported in [34] also exploits physical proper-
ties in order to provide secure localization mechanism for wireless
sensor networks without relying on redundancy.
Numerous results in the literature have described and implemented
counter-measures for passive attacks (e.g, eavesdropping), espe-
cially in the RFID literature. For example, in the work reported
in [37, 29] the eavesdropper reveals itself through power leakage
(e.g., oscillators), provided such power measurements can be ob-
tained. In contrast, PyCRA does not assume the existence of power
consumption side-channels. Rather, the experiments shown in Fig-
ure 10 demonstrate an environment with only a passive eavesdrop-

Another example is the
work reported in [11] which considers an active relay attack where
the attacker actively sends information. The detection scheme is
based on detecting the action of sending. As discussed above, our
system works for completely passive attacks. However, PyCRA is
not designed to protect against a passive eavesdropper that mea-
sures backscattered waves as discussed in [12] (compared to mag-
netic coupling eavesdropping). Typically RFID range is small and
we make the case that PyCRA creates security for short-range op-
eration. Indeed, some of the ideas in literature can serve to comple-
ment the contributions in PyCRA.
8.2 Physics, Randomness, & Security
The underlying ideas behind PyCRA utilize accurate mathemati-
cal models that capture the physics and dynamics of active sensors.
With these models in hand, PyCRA is able to isolate the response of
the attacker from the response of the environment when challenged
by the proposed secure sensor. The success of the system presented
in this paper lends credence to the notion of physical challenge-
response authentication as a whole. Section 1 made brief mention
of several additional sensing modalities where PyCRA can provide
improved security. In fact, adaptation of the methods described in
this work to these sensors is not difﬁcult—one need only revisit the
physical models involved in order to derive a method of probing the
physical environment and measuring the environmental response.
The results presented in the previous sections demonstrate the
key strengths of PyCRA—namely that it uses fundamental proper-
ties of physics (physical delays and noise) along with mathemat-
ical models to provided the following security aids (i) timely and
accurate detection of external, potentially malicious sources of sig-
nal interference, (ii) resilience via accurate estimation of malicious
spectra, and (iii) accurate detection of passive eavesdropping at-
tacks. The success of these security mechanisms are bolstered by
physical limitations such as delays (τattack) and change point detec-
tion, for which we have derived theoretical guarantees.
Another major factor in the security provided by PyCRA is the
amount of randomness used in generating the physical challenges.
The relationship between randomness and security guarantees is
a classical relationship that appears in most cryptographic security
protocols. However, a fundamental difference in this scheme is that
PyCRA relies only on private randomness compared to shared ran-
domness in classical cryptographic authentication schemes. This is
a consequence of the “passivity” property of the measured entity
exploited by PyCRA. This in turn eliminates the classical prob-
lem of random data distribution (e.g., key distribution) and thus
increases the security provided by the proposed system.
8.3 Overcoming Negative Effects of PyCRA
A PyCRA-secured sensor will occasionally cease measurement
of the physical phenomena it is measuring. This can negatively
affect the overall sensor performance. However, measuring any
physical phenomenon requires a sampling rate dictated by its band-
width—e.g., magnetic encoders require 50Hz sampling-rate—while
electronics can operate much faster (e.g., 10kHz in our experi-
ments), and we exploit this by performing authentication using
oversampling, thereby performing multiple authentications within
a single physics-dictated sampling-period. Once the sensor is au-
thenticated, we can select any of the authenticated measurements
collected within the sampling-period and provide this as the ‘se-
cure’ sensor measurement without affecting performance.
If the
sensor detects an attack, then attack-resilient estimation/computa-
tion (shown in Section 7) needs to be carried out. Again, these
computations operate at a higher sampling rate. Higher sampling
rate comes at the cost of increased power consumption, but this is
perhaps a reasonable price to pay for security.
9. CONCLUSION
We have presented PyCRA, a physical challenge-response au-
thentication method for active sensors. The driving concept be-
hind PyCRA is that, through random physical stimulation and sub-
sequent behavior analyses, we are able to determine whether or
not a sensor is under attack and, in some cases, remain resilient
to attacks. This work further describes ways in which the Py-
CRA scheme can be applied to (1) passive eavesdropping attacks,
(2) simple spooﬁng attacks, and (3) more advanced spooﬁng at-
tacks. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of PyCRA for more
than 90 experiments on physical hardware focusing on three case
studies: magnetic encoder attack detection, magnetic encoder at-
tack resilience, and RFID eavesdropping detection. Our results
from these case studies indicate that physical challenge-response
authentication can accurately and reliably detect and mitigate ma-
licious attacks at the analog sensor level. Finally, we believe the
results discussed in this work lend credence to the notion of physi-
cal challenge-response systems in general, advocating its adoption
for active sensors in general where secure operation is a critical
component. More broadly, PyCRA offers security to a wide array
of systems (not just sensors) where inputs are mapped to outputs
by well-understood models.
