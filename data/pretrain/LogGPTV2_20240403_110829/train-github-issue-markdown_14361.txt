For applications with a large number of components (exceeding 500), the `dart2js` build step is encountering out-of-memory errors. To alleviate this issue, it is recommended to refactor and abstract any duplicated or boilerplate code from the generated change detectors into utility functions or the `AbstractChangeDetector` class. This approach will reduce the amount of code that `dart2js` needs to process, thereby mitigating memory pressure during the build process.
