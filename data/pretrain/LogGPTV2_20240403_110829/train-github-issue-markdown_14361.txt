The `dart2js` build step for apps with large numbers of components (>500) is
running out of memory.
Abstracting duplicated and boilerplate code out of generated change detectors
and into utilities and/or `AbstractChangeDetector` will give `dart2js` less
code to process and should help with memory pressure.
