User: I'm searching for a single function to convert RGB tuple (255, 255, 255) or HTML hex (#FFFFFF) to X11 color (0...255 int) to manage colors in Unix terminal. I've looked over the internet but I didn't find anything like that, so I'm asking for code or link to a website that contains code or information about how I can do this in Python.
Assistant: If I understand your question properly, I don't think you can do this. The RGB tuple (and its representation as a 6-digit hex number for HTML) represents a specific color in the RGB colorspace. The single integer in the range 0 to 255 you mention for the Unix terminal isn't a specific color, but rather an index into a color table. As an example, color 15 on one terminal may be #ff0000, but #33ff33 on another. There really isn't a conversion between the two.
