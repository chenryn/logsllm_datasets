User: Do subprocess calls in Python hang? That is, do subprocess calls operate in the same thread as the rest of the Python code, or is it a non-blocking model? I couldn't find anything in the docs or on SO on the matter. Thanks!
Assistant: subprocesses run in the background. In the subprocess module, there is a class called Popen that starts a process in the background. It has a wait() method you can use to wait for the process to finish. It also has a communicate() helper method that will handle stdin/stdout/stderr plus wait for the process to complete. It also has convenience functions like call() and check_call() that create a Popen object and then wait for it to complete.
So, subprocess implements a non-blocking model but also gives you blocking helper functions.
