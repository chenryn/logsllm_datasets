Question: Why should all registers holding security-critical information be set to a specific value on reset, and what are the potential drawbacks of this approach?
"A": "To ensure a deterministic state and prevent attackers from exploiting indeterminate states; however, it may lead to predictability that can be leveraged by attackers.",
"B": "To reduce power consumption on reset; however, it may increase the overall complexity of the system.",
"C": "To speed up the system initialization process; however, it could lead to synchronization issues across different components.",
"D": "To comply with industry coding standards; however, it may not be necessary for non-security-critical registers."
Answer: A
