User: How to safely enable remote SSH login on Linux system?
Assistant: To enable remote SSH login on the Linux system, you can refer to the following steps: 1. Confirm whether the SSH service of the system has been installed. Use the following command to check whether it is installed: ``` $ which sshd ``` If it is already installed, the absolute path of ssh will appear, for example: /usr/sbin/sshd; if it is not installed, you need to install it first. 2. Select an appropriate SSH port based on actual needs. The default SSH port is 22, but in order to prevent network attacks, you can set the SSH port to a larger number, such as 2233. 3. Configure the SSH service to ensure security. Modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, and add the following configurations as needed: ``` Port 2233 # Set the SSH port to 2233 PermitRootLogin no # Root users are not allowed to log in directly to SSH PasswordAuthentication no # Disable password login, only allow SSH Key login X11Forwarding no # Disable X11 graphical window ``` 4. Close unnecessary ports and services. If not necessary, it is recommended to close some unused ports and services to increase system security. 5. Modify the firewall configuration to allow SSH access. By default, the firewall may block SSH access, so you need to modify the firewall configuration and add the SSH port to the list of ports allowed to access. 6. Restart the SSH service to make the settings take effect: ``` $ systemctl restart sshd ``` 7. Remote login test. Use the SSH key to log in, test whether the new SSH port takes effect, and whether the login is successful. The above are the steps and methods for safely enabling remote SSH login on the Linux system. Users can change and optimize it according to actual needs.
