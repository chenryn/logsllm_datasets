User: I am getting an 'access is denied' error when I attempt to delete a folder that is not empty. I used the following command in my attempt: os.remove("/folder_name"). 
What is the most effective way of removing/deleting a folder/directory that is not empty?
Assistant: For Windows, if directory is not empty, and you have read-only files or you get errors like 

Access is denied
The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process

Try this, os.system('rmdir /S /Q "{}"'.format(directory))
It's equivalent for rm -rf in Linux/Mac.
