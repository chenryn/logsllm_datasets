User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题One Time Passwords. Using OTP at Windows, Ubuntu and internet sites Is there a way (software, hardware/token or web-ware) to use One Time Passwords in the following scenarios:

Logon to my pc/laptop (windows or ubuntu)
Logon to sites with OTP (without having out-of-the-box support for OTP, which AFAIK none of them have).

Do you use any OTP solution? Experiences so far?
I'm interested in both freeware/opensource and commercial (paid) solutions.

Assistant: OPIE Authentication System ("One time Passwords In Everything") works on most any BSD/Linux/Unix system - e.g. opie-server and opie-client packages under Ubuntu.  It can be used e.g. in PAM authentication or for web servers.  There are clients (at least) for Windows and MacOS also.

If a site is a "relying party" for some sort of federated authentication (e.g. OAuth, OpenID, Shibboleth, SAML) you can use OTP once to log in to an identity provider that supports it, and use what are essentially one-time credentials from them to log in to the site.
