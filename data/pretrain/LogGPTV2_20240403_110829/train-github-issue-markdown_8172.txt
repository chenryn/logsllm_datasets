**Current behavior**  
Having a component with a ngClass, where the clauses have two or more of the
same css classes, will be getting the css classes set wrongly, when using the
component twice in a view.
**Expected behavior**  
All components used multiple times in a view should.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
For better understanding I'll start with the _Tour of Heroes: Part 3_ Exmaple
available on Plnkr and modify it.
To reproduce it you will have to give `my-hero-detail` a ngClass, like
`[ngClass]="{'main' : isMain, 'main second': !isMain}"` and set `isMain` as a
input variable of the component. When using the component `my-hero-detail`
twice in a view, where the first component is set to `(isMain)=true` and the
second is one is set to `(isMain)=false`, you will have a class missing in the
first component. The second component will have the correct class set, being
`class="main second"`, while the first component will have an empty class
field `class=""`.

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Basically setting the right classes, when needed, without loosing a class.
