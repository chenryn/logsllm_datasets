1 Context, Motivation and Focus 
Unprecedented  levels  of  information  processing,  novel 
architectural  solutions  and  a  new  realm  of  unprecedented 
applications  promise  to  be  reached  thanks  to  the  advances 
in  semiconductor  technologies  for  integrating  extremely 
large  numbers  of  scaled  down  transistors  or  processing 
elements  into  a  chip.  Towards  this  ends,  two  main  tracks  
— evolutionary and revolutionary — are considered [1]:  
1.  Top-down  “More  Moore”:  this  track  is  pushing  further 
the  long  standing  Moore’s  Law-based  trend  in  chip 
development  that  aims  at  reducing  the  dimensions  of 
silicon  microelectronics  and  is  progressively  reaching 
nanometric scale elementary devices. 
2.  Bottom-up  “Beyond  Moore”:  this  track  departs  from 
features  atomic 
classical  silicon  technologies  and 
assemblies  of  nanoscale 
include 
fabrics; 
nanowires, carbon nanotubes or organic molecules, etc., 
and  extend  also  to  quantum  computing,  optical 
computing and micro/nanofluidics. 
these 
Due  to  the  differences  in  relative  advances  and  current  in-
dustrial concerns attached to each track, this second edition 
of the Workshop will still emphasize the top-down track for 
which it is now widely recognized to pose serious challenges 
both from the Dependability and Security viewpoints.  
long  standing  Moore’s  Law-based  trend 
The 
in  IC 
development  is  aiming  at  nanometric  scale  elementary 
devices.  The  emerging  downsized  technologies  are  already 
impaired  by  significant  variations  affecting  process 
parameters  and  thus  become  a  nightmare  to  reliability 
engineers for reaching an acceptable manufacturing yield at 
viable  cost.  Indeed,  the  dramatic  reduction  of  digital 
devices  is  accompanied  by  a  decrease  in  power  supply  and 
threshold  levels  which  in  turn  result  in  lower  noise 
immunity  and  greater  sensitivity  to  radiation  particles. 
Moreover,  additional  instabilities  may  affect  circuits  in 
operation, e.g., in CMOS devices negative bias temperature 
instability (NBTI) has a strong impact on threshold voltage 
over time.  
Beyond  concerns  attached  to  the  impact  of  accidental 
defects  and  disturbances,  one  has  also  to  consider 
vulnerabilities  and  malicious  threats  related  to  hardware 
chips.  These  include  information  leakages  due  to  side 
channels  attacks  or  differential  fault  analysis  based  on 
applying  environmental  disturbances  or  even 
fault 
injection. Device downsizing and increased chip complexity 
are  commonly  understood  as  positive  factors  in  reducing 
hardware  vulnerabilities  with  respect  to  security  issues 
(especially for  what concerns cryptochips or  IC intellectual 
property). Nevertheless, one should not neglect the  related 
problems  attached  to  the  observability  and  controllability 
facilities  provided  by 
testing  devices 
incorporated into the chips. 
scan-based 
to 
Considerations  attached 
the  emerging  nanoscale 
technologies  are  also  part  of  the  scope  of  the  Workshop. 
Indeed,  such  technologies  are  intrinsically  exposed  to  a 
significant  rate  of  residual  defects  and  fault  occurrence. 
While  rapidly  evolving  [2],  the  manufacturing  processes 
are  still  impaired  by  significant  statistical  variability  of 
each  device’s  key  physical,  chemical,  and  electrical 
properties.  Moreover,  due  to  their  very  small  scale,  these 
devices  are  prone  to  various  kinds  of  noise,  including 
energy  coupling,  temperature  variations,  and  single-event 
upsets.  Finally,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that,  at  that  scale, 
there  is  limited  ability  to  monitor  what’s  happening, 
which  make  failure  analysis  extraordinarily  difficult. 
Planning  and  developing  tools  suitable  for  nanoscale 
devices  and  circuit  fabrics  will  be  a  new  frontier  for  the 
digital  circuit  and  system  design  process  in  the  years  to 
come.  Recent  advances  in  hybrid  chips  design  pave  the 
way towards such significant achievements [3]. 
2 Towards Resilient Nanocomputing  
For  both  tracks,  the  key  challenge  is  how  to  build  resilient 
systems  from  imperfect  devices.  Such  a  question  reminds 
the early days of digital computers and somewhat  relates to 
the  seminal  work  on  improving  reliability,  by  Moore  & 
Shannon and Von Neuman, and revisited in [4]. 
Several  recent  advances  are  been  made  to  tackle  the 
underlying  problems  (e.g.,  see  [5]).  To  help  mitigate  these 
issues and possibly extend the applicability of Moore's Law, 
original design paradigms are being considered that depart 
from  the  classical  frequency,  power  and  correctness 
framework.  Among  them  lies  the  concept  of  “probabilistic 
chips”,  that  are  relaxing  the  correctness  requirement  to 
produce  significant  savings 
for 
processor chips, high degrees of parallelization relying on a 
very  large  number  of  computing  nodes  [7]  are  being 
thought  as  fitting  alternatives  to  most  common  scalar  or 
in  energy  [6].  Also,

There  is  still  a  strong  demand  for  solutions  to  improve 
dependability  and  security.  Issues  at  stake  include  threats 
ranging  from  managing  complexity  and  manufacturing 
defects 
to 
environment  disturbances.  These  solutions  extend  beyond 
hardware,  microelectronics  or  physics;  major  computing-
related  issues  spanning  various  aspects  are  also  essential: 
architecture,  networks,  communication,  synchronization, 
task parallelization, etc. 
susceptibility 
The  Workshop  is  aimed  at  further  characterizing  these 
impairments and threats, as well as distinguishing possible 
alternative  design  approaches  and  operation  control 
paradigms that have to be enforced and/or favored in order 
to  keep  achieving  dependable  and  secure  computing. 
Finally,  it  is  worth  pointing  out  that  besides  design 
techniques  aimed  at  providing  dependable  and  secure 
computing,  assessment 
(risk  evaluation, 
validation,  testing,  etc.)  should  also  play  a  fundamental 
role!  For all these  reasons,  we believe that DSN is an ideal 
forum  to  address  all  these  issues  and  foster  fruitful 
exchanges  on  a  long  term  basis.  Accordingly,  the  main 
topics of interest span the following: 
• Failure modes specific to nanocomputing technologies, 
• Soft errors in nanocomputing devices, 
• Yield and mitigation techniques in nanocomputing, 
• On-line  monitoring  of  physical  parameters  as  reliability 
techniques 
indicators, 
• Fault tolerance mechanisms for nanoscale chips, 
• On-line adaptive and reconfigurable nanoarchitectures, 
• Scalable verification, testing and diagnosis methods, 
• Failure modes assessment and risk analysis, 
• Malicious threats and security issues, 
• Resilience  issues  in  emerging  nanoscale  fabrics  and 
technologies. 
Three main goals are identified for the Workshop: 
1.  Review  the  state-of-knowledge  concerning  the  threats 
at stake in nanocomputing technologies: manufacturing 
defects,  accidental operational faults, malicious attacks. 
2.  Identify  existing  solutions  and  propose  new  solutions 
attached  to  various  design  options  for  mitigating  faults 
and 
implementing  secure  and  resilient  computing 
devices and systems. 
3.  Forecast  the  risks  associated  to  emerging  technologies 
and  foster  new  trends  for  cooperative  work,  possibly 
combining various alternatives to help increase the pace 
of advances and solutions. 
To  tackle  these  multiple  goals,  the  planned  program  is 
featuring  varied  forms  of  contributions:  invited  talks, 
submitted papers, and a panel. We hope that you will enjoy 
the  Workshop  and  actively  participate  by  interacting  with 
the various contributors. We also  very much welcome your 
comments and suggestions for future plans of this event.
