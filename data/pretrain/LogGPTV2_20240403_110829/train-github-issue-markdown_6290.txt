Shouldn't there be a white-space between inline DOM elements separated by a
line break [1]?
I think this example describes the situation pretty well:

Right now the workarounds are pretty ugly -- either CSS (don't get me
started!) or manual white-space inside the inline elements (as in
`foobar `), both of which are quite non-semantic.
Hope it's not a duplicate of an earlier issue -- I did my research!  
Cheers!
