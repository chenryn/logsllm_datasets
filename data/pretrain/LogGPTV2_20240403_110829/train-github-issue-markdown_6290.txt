Should there be a white space between inline DOM elements that are separated by a line break [1]?

I believe this example accurately illustrates the situation: 
<http://jsfiddle.net/bstst/kb3gN/2847/>

Currently, the workarounds for this issue are less than ideal. They either involve using CSS (which can be problematic) or manually adding white space within the inline elements (such as `foobar `). Both of these solutions lack semantic clarity.

I hope this is not a duplicate of an earlier issue; I have done my due diligence in researching this matter.

Best regards,
M.
