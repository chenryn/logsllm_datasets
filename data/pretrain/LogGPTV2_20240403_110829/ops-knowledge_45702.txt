It seems like you're encountering issues while trying to install Apache Mesos on CentOS due to Python version incompatibilities. Hereâ€™s a more structured and professional approach to resolve the problem:

### Problem Summary
- You are attempting to install Apache Mesos on CentOS.
- The `./configure` command fails because the installed Python version (2.4) is not compatible with Mesos, which requires Python 2.6.
- Upgrading Python using the package manager only upgrades to version 2.4.
- Manually installing Python 2.6 and creating a symbolic link to `/usr/bin/python` breaks the `yum` command and still does not resolve the issue.

### Solution

1. **Install Python 2.6 Development Libraries:**
   - First, ensure that the Python 2.6 development libraries are installed. This can be done using the `yum` package manager.

     ```sh
     sudo yum install python26-devel
     ```

2. **Set Up Alternatives for Python:**
   - Use the `alternatives` system to manage multiple versions of Python. This will allow you to switch between different Python versions without breaking system tools like `yum`.

     ```sh
     sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/local/bin/python2.6 100
     sudo alternatives --config python
     ```

     Select the appropriate Python version when prompted.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Set the `LDFLAGS` environment variable to point to the correct Python library path. This ensures that the `./configure` script can find the necessary libraries.

     ```sh
     export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
     export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/python2.6"
     ```

4. **Re-run the Configuration Script:**
   - Now, try running the `./configure` script again.

     ```sh
     ./configure
     ```

5. **Compile and Install Mesos:**
   - If the `./configure` script completes successfully, proceed to compile and install Mesos.

     ```sh
     make
     sudo make install
     ```

### Additional Tips

- **Verify Python Version:**
  - Ensure that the correct Python version is being used by checking the version.

    ```sh
    python --version
    ```

- **Backup and Restore Yum:**
  - If `yum` stops working after changing the Python version, you can restore it by re-linking the original Python binary.

    ```sh
    sudo mv /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python.bak
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python2.4 /usr/bin/python
    ```

- **Check for Dependencies:**
  - Ensure all other dependencies required by Mesos are installed. Refer to the [official Mesos documentation](http://mesos.apache.org/getting-started/) for a complete list of dependencies.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install Apache Mesos on your CentOS system.
