User: I am trying to install mesos on CentOs. I downloaded it and run ./configure command. But couldn't be completed due to installed version of python as mesos requires development version 2.6. I tried to upgrade python but it upgrades to 2.4 only. Then I manually download python 2.6 and install, which is located under /usr/local/bin/ and the old one is located under /usr/bin. When I run the python command in terminal it displays python 2.6, but again when I configure mesos it again gives same error. 

configure: error: in `/root/mesos-0.14.1':
  configure: error:
    Could not link test program to Python. Maybe the main Python library has been
    installed in some non-standard library path. If so, pass it to configure,
    via the LDFLAGS environment variable.
    Example: ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/non-standard-path/python/lib"

     ERROR!
     You probably have to install the development version of the Python package
     for your distribution.  The exact name of this package varies among them.

I then create symbolic link of /usr/local/bin/python to /usr/bin/python but now 'yum' command doesn't work also configuring mesos again gives same error. I also tried ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/python/lib" .What should I do to install mesos cluster in Cent Os ? What is the solution ?
Assistant: you need to have python dev version (headers etc.)
try 
yum install python-devel
