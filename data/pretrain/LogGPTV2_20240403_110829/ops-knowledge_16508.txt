Open source software is not for profit, but was born based on the values of sharing and collaboration. The advantages of open source software include: 1. Transparency: The code of open source software is open, so that users can study the functions of the software in depth and modify and customize it. 2. Flexibility: Open source software is highly customizable and can meet various needs of users. 3. Sharing: Open source software provides a platform for developers in various fields to share technology and experience, facilitating collaboration and innovation. 4.

Portability: Open source software can usually run across platforms, which is very beneficial for users who need to run on different operating systems. But open source software also has its disadvantages: 1. Maintainability: Since open source software is maintained and supported by the community, its update and maintenance may not be as good as professional commercial software. 2. Technical barriers: The customization function of open source software is very strong, but for some users with low technical quality, it may take extra time and effort to study its usage. 3.
