ﬁciently strong signal on the modern network. Fig. 11
plots the baseline latencies of Tor routers as well as the
latencies of routers subjected to Murdoch and Danezis’s
congestion attack in the style we used in Fig. 6. There are
hardly any noticeable differences between routers under
Murdoch and Danezis’s congestion attack and the base-
line. Fig. 12 shows the latency histograms for the same
data; in contrast to the histograms in Fig. 6 there is little
difference between the histograms for the baseline and
the attack.
In conclusion, due to the large amount of trafﬁc on the
modern Tor network, Murdoch and Danezis’s analysis is
unable to differentiate between normal congestion and
congestion caused by the attacker; the small amount of
congestion caused by Murdoch and Danezis is lost in the
noise of the network. As a result, their analysis produces
many false positives and false negatives. While these ex-
periments only represent a limited case-study and while
Murdoch and Danezis’s analysis may still work in some
cases, we never got reasonable results on the modern Tor
network.

Table 3: This table shows the correlation values calculated using the Murdoch and Danezis’s attack on the Tor network
in Spring of 2008. False positives and false negatives are both abundant; many naturally congested routers show a
strong correlation suggesting they are part of the circuit when they are not.
Figure 11: These graphs correspond to Fig. 10, showing the same attack in the style we used in Fig. 5. Note that during
the attack phase the congestion circuit is turned on and off just as illustrated in Fig. 10. For all four routers the latency
measurements are almost identical whether the attack was present or not.

use in Fig. 6. The overlap between the control run and the attack run is difﬁcult to see due to the similarity of latency
distributions.
7 Conclusion
The possibility of constructing circuits of arbitrary length
was previously seen as a minor problem that could lead
to a DoS attack on Tor. This work shows that the prob-
lem is more serious, in that an adversary could use such
circuits to improve methods for determining the path that
packets take through the Tor network. Furthermore, Tor’s
minimalistic default choice to use circuits of length three
is questionable, given that an adversary controlling an
exit node would only need to recover a tiny amount of
information to learn the entire circuit. We have made
some minimal changes to the Tor protocol that make it
more difﬁcult (but not impossible) for an adversary to
construct long circuits.
