User: How to use Ansible to perform batch configuration on multiple servers?
Assistant: You can manage multiple servers through Ansible's inventory file, and then use playbooks for batch configuration. The steps are as follows: 1. Create an inventory file, the content format is as follows: ``` [webservers] web01 ansible_host=192.168.1.101 web02 ansible_host=192.168.1.102 [dbservers] db01 ansible_host=192.168.1.201 db02 ansible_host=192.168. 1.202 ``` 2 . Specify the target host to be configured in playbooks, such as: ``` - hosts: webservers tasks: - name: Install Apache yum: name: httpd state: latest ``` The function of this playbook code is in the webservers group Install the latest version of Apache on the host. 3. Run playbooks, such as: ``` ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml ``` This command will automatically execute the tasks specified in the playbook on the target host according to the host configuration in the inventory file to achieve batch configuration.
