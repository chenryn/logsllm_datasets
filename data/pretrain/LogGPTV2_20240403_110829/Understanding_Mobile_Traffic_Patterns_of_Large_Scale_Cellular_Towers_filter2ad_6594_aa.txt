ABSTRACT
Understanding mobile traﬃc patterns of large scale cellular
towers in urban environment is extremely valuable for In-
ternet service providers, mobile users, and government man-
agers of modern metropolis. This paper aims at extracting
and modeling the traﬃc patterns of large scale towers de-
ployed in a metropolitan city. To achieve this goal, we need
to address several challenges, including lack of appropriate
tools for processing large scale traﬃc measurement data,
unknown traﬃc patterns, as well as handling complicated
factors of urban ecology and human behaviors that aﬀect
traﬃc patterns. Our core contribution is a powerful model
which combines three dimensional information (time, loca-
tions of towers, and traﬃc frequency spectrum) to extract
and model the traﬃc patterns of thousands of cellular tow-
ers. Our empirical analysis reveals the following important
observations. First, only ﬁve basic time-domain traﬃc pat-
terns exist among the 9,600 cellular towers. Second, each of
the extracted traﬃc pattern maps to one type of geograph-
ical locations related to urban ecology, including residential
area, business district, transport, entertainment, and com-
prehensive area. Third, our frequency-domain traﬃc spec-
trum analysis suggests that the traﬃc of any tower among
the 9,600 can be constructed using a linear combination of
four primary components corresponding to human activi-
ty behaviors. We believe that the proposed traﬃc patterns
extraction and modeling methodology, combined with the
empirical analysis on the mobile traﬃc, pave the way to-
ward a deep understanding of the traﬃc patterns of large
scale cellular towers in modern metropolis.

INTRODUCTION
The past few years have seen a dramatic growth in cellu-
lar network traﬃc, contributed by billions of mobile devices
as the ﬁrst-class citizens of the Internet. The global cellular
network traﬃc from mobile devices is expected to surpass
24 exabytes (1018) per month by 2019 [1], 9× larger than
the traﬃc served by existing cellular network. While we
are embracing a world with ambient cellular connectivity,
however, we are facing a critical and challenging problem —
we have limited understanding about the patterns of traf-
ﬁc experienced by cellular towers deployed in urban areas,
especially when 3G and LTE networks are widely available
in current modern metropolis[1, 2, 5]. We do not complete-
ly understand how urban functional regions and ecologies,
such as business district, aﬀect the mobile traﬃc of cellular
towers[2]. In addition, the dominant factors that aﬀect their
traﬃc variations are still unknown. Such limited knowledge
signiﬁcantly increases the cost of operating thousands of cel-
lular towers in big cities.
Despite of the aforementioned lack of knowledge, under-
standing the traﬃc patterns of cellular towers in the large
scale urban environment is extremely valuable for Internet
service providers (ISP), mobile users, and government man-
agers of modern cites[6, 16, 21]. If we can identify and model
the patterns of cellular towers, instead of using the same s-
trategy to provide services, such as using the same load bal-
ancing and data pricing algorithms on each tower, an ISP
can exploit the modeled traﬃc patterns and customize the s-
trategies for individual cellular towers. For example, an ISP
can potentially have diﬀerent pricing on individual cellular
tower based on the traﬃc it experiences. In addition, mobile
users will beneﬁt from the traﬃc modeling as well because
they can choose towers with predicted lower traﬃc and en-
joy better services. Surprisingly, management departments
of government will beneﬁt from the traﬃc modeling as well
because they may infer the land usage and human economy
activities by looking at the patterns of cellular traﬃc[14].
On the other hand, understanding the traﬃc patterns of
cellular towers is challenging for three reasons. First, the
traﬃc experienced by thousands of cellular towers deployed
225in large scale modern cities is complicated and hard to ana-
lyze. For example, our dataset includes 9,600 cellular towers
and 150,000 subscribers, where lots of redundant and con-
ﬂict logs are observed. To identify traﬃc patterns embedded
in the thousands of towers, we need to design a system that
is able to clean and handle the data of large scale cellular
traﬃc. Second, we do not have the priori about the existence
of patterns that can be used for representing the behavior
of thousands of cellular towers. To make matters worse,
even if such patterns exist, we do not know their proﬁles.
Without these proﬁles, it is challenging to group thousands
of cellular towers into a small number of patterns. Third,
the traﬃc of a cellular tower is aﬀected by many factors,
such as time and locations, etc. These factors, sometimes,
compound with each other and further complicate our anal-
ysis. For example, signiﬁcant traﬃc variation is observed
at both ﬁne-grained (hours) and coarse-grained (days) time
scale, and across towers deployed in diﬀerent locations[25,
16]. By addressing these challenges, in this paper, we inves-
tigate how to extract and model the mobile traﬃc patterns
of thousands of cellular towers in a large scale urban envi-
ronment via credible dataset collected by one of the largest
commercial mobile operators.
Our core contribution is a powerful model which combines
three dimensional information, including time, locations of
towers, and traﬃc frequency spectrum, for extracting and
modeling the traﬃc patterns of thousands of cellular tow-
ers. A breakdown of the core contribution comprises three
parts. First, we design a system which leverages machine
learning to identify and extract ﬁve patterns from the traf-
ﬁc of thousands of cellular towers. Our system is built with
processing large scale data in mind and is able to process the
traﬃc of thousands of towers with granularity of 10 minutes.
Second, we identify the geographical context of traﬃc expe-
rienced by cellular towers by investigating the correlation
between time-domain traﬃc characteristics and geographi-
cal locations of towers. Therefore, by looking at the traﬃc
pattern of a tower, we can infer the type of location where
it is deployed and the type of users it serves. Third, our
frequency-domain traﬃc spectrum analysis reveals that any
traﬃc of the 9,600 cellular towers can be constructed us-
ing a linear combination of four primary components cor-
responding to human activity behaviors. This observation
provides an unique angle (frequency) for analyzing cellular
traﬃc and signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the process of analysis by
a linear model.
Through investigating the traﬃc of 9,600 cellular towers,
we ﬁnd following interesting observations. First, the 9,600
cellular towers can be classiﬁed into ﬁve groups using fea-
tures extracted from time-domain traﬃc. This experimental
result conﬁrms our motivation that a small number of pat-
terns do exist among thousands of cellular towers. Second,
each of the traﬃc pattern maps to one type of geographi-
cal locations, including resident, oﬃce, transport, entertain-
ment, and comprehensive area. Therefore, the traﬃc pat-
tern of a cellular tower does suggest the urban ecology and
geographical location context where it is deployed as well
as the type of users it serves. Third, our frequency-domain
analysis reveals that the transition between the ﬁve traﬃc
patterns encodes the mobility of human. For example, when
the phase of residential pattern moves toward the phase of
transport pattern, people start their commute from home to
work. In summary, we believe that the proposed traﬃc pat-
terns extraction and modeling, combined with the empirical
study on large scale cellular towers, pave the way toward
a deep understanding of the traﬃc patterns of large scale
cellular towers.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we pro-
vide details about the utilized dataset, and present some ba-
sic observations of traﬃc spatio-temporal distributions. In
Section 3, we design our traﬃc processing system and iden-
tify the key traﬃc patterns of the large scale cellular towers.
Based on the discovered ﬁve traﬃc patterns, in Section 4 and
5, we conduct a deep analysis and reveal the correlation a-
mong data traﬃc, urban ecology and human behaviors in the
time and frequency domain respectively. After discussing re-
lated work in Section 6, we summarize our discoveries and
discuss potential investigations in Section 7.
2. DATASET AND VISUALIZATION
In this section, we provide details about the dataset we
investigate as well as the needed preprocessing. In addition,
we visualize the spatial-temporal distribution of cellular traf-
ﬁc.
2.1 Dataset Description
The dataset is an anonymized cellular trace collected by
an ISP from Shanghai, a big city in China, between Aug
1st and Aug 31st 2014. Each entry of the trace contains de-
tailed mobile data usage of 150,000 users, including the ID
of devices (anonymized), start-end time of data connection,
base station ID, address of base station, and the amount of
3G or LTE data used in each connection. The trace logs
1.96 billion tuples of the described information, contribut-
ed by approximately 9,600 base stations all over Shanghai.
The trace contains 2.4 petabytes (1015) logs, 77 terabytes
(1012) per day and 8 gigabytes (109) per base station on av-
erage. This large scale and ﬁne-grained dataset guarantees
the credibility of our traﬃc pattern analysis and modeling.
2.2 Preprocessing
The trace collected by the ISP needs to be preprocessed
because of the existence of redundant and conﬂict traﬃc
logs as well as the incomplete information of base stations’
locations. The preprocessing includes three steps. First, we
eliminate the redundant and conﬂict logs, such as the iden-
tical traﬃc logs, introduced by technical issues. Second, to
solve the problem of incomplete information, we convert the
addresses of base stations to their geographical longitudes
and latitudes through APIs provided by Baidu Map, the
most popular online map service provider in China. This
conversion gives us the precise geographical location of a
base station, which is important for analyzing the ground
truth of urban functional regions. The last step of prepro-
cessing is computing the traﬃc density (byte/km2) across
the city. The obtained traﬃc density allows us to under-
stand the spatial distribution of cellular traﬃc.
2.3 Data Visualization
Before diving into a deep analysis of mobile data traﬃc,
we ﬁrst visualize the spatial-temporal traﬃc distribution of
the 9,600 base stations, where we ﬁnd two interesting obser-
vations.
First, the data embeds fundamental temporal patterns of
mobile data traﬃc. Figure 1 shows the aggregated traf-
ﬁc of the 9,600 towers at diﬀerent time scales. Figure 1(a)

shows the traﬃc distribution of a day (Aug 7th 2014, Thurs-
day) where we observe that the aggregated network traﬃc
is tightly coupled with the sleep pattern of humans. High
cellular traﬃc is observed during the day and low traﬃc is
experienced during midnight. There are two traﬃc peaks in
each day: one around 12PM and the other around 10PM.
Similar patterns are observed in Figure 1(b). The timing of
the two peaks suggests that most people tend to consume
data traﬃc heavily after lunch and before sleep. Figure 1(b)
shows the traﬃc distribution of a week (from Aug 4 to Aug
10 2014) and Figure 1(c) shows the traﬃc distribution of
a month (from Aug 3 to Aug 31 2014). Both ﬁgures show
that the traﬃc exhibits a periodical pattern on the scale of
a week, where weekend’s traﬃc is less than weekday’s traf-
ﬁc. Such traﬃc variation comes from people’s weekly work
schedule.
On the other hand, our trace also records the spatial distri-
bution of mobile data traﬃc. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that the
spatial and temporal characteristics of traﬃc are correlated.
Figure 2 shows the geographical traﬃc density (bytes trans-
mitted per hour per km2) at 4AM, 10AM, 4PM and 10PM.
As shown in the color bar, the red one indicates higher traﬃc
and the blue one stands for lower traﬃc. We ﬁnd the fol-
lowing observations. First, towers deployed at the center of
the city experience high traﬃc despite of the time of a day.
Second, at 4AM, most areas of the city are covered by dark
color, which suggests that traﬃc demand is small because of
human sleep. In contrast, at 10AM, most areas of the city
are covered by light color, suggesting that traﬃc demand
becomes high because people start working. Therefore, the
areas of peak traﬃc map to areas occupied by human, such
as residential housing or central business district (CBD).

IDENTIFYING TRAFFIC PATTERNS OF
CELLULAR TOWERS
Now, we investigate the data traﬃc of the thousands of
3G/LTE cellular towers and design a system that is able
to identify key traﬃc patterns of large scale cellular towers.
We start from understanding the traﬃc patterns of a few
cellular towers to motivate our study.
3.1 Motivation and Problem Statement
Our cellular network traﬃc measurement and analysis are
motivated by a key observation — the traﬃc pattern of one
cellular tower is vastly diﬀerent from another. Through on-
line map service, we randomly select four towers from the
positions of residential areas and four towers from business

districts, and plot their normalized traﬃc proﬁle in the left
and right column of Figure 3, respectively. We can clearly
observe the diﬀerence of traﬃc between these two types of
cellular towers, where the traﬃc proﬁles of residential tow-
ers have two peaks within a day and remain high across
night, while the traﬃc proﬁles of towers in business distric-
t experience only one peak within a day and get close to
zero across night. This comparison clearly reveals the dif-
ference of traﬃc patterns between the two speciﬁc types of
cellular towers. However, from the perspective of an ISP,
which manages thousands of cellular towers, is the traﬃc
pattern of one cellular tower vastly diﬀerent from another?
To understand this problem, we conduct a large scale mea-
surement and investigate the recorded 9600 cellular towers
in our dataset of Shanghai.
Figure 4 shows the normalized traﬃc variations within
one day with 40 randomly selected cellular towers for each
0.01 degree latitudes or longitudes respectively. The x-axis
shows the time in hours and y-axis shows the logical po-
sitions of the selected cellular towers in terms of latitude
(a) or longitude (b). For example, the ﬁrst row of pixels
in Figure 4(a) represent the traﬃc variations of one cellular
towers, of which the latitude is around 121.60 and the longi-
tude is randomly selected. Traﬃc measured on each cellular
