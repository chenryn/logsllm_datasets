Any updates?
I got a lot of ts errors when I used `@deno-types` to include type definitions
for the ky libarry.
    // @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/ky@v0.23.0/index.d.ts"
    export { default as ky } from "https://deno.land/x/ky@v0.23.0/index.js
From the error message, it is the `lib.dom.d.ts` which causes conflicts with
other definitions.
    TS2300 [ERROR]: Duplicate identifier 'Event'.
    declare class Event {
                  ~~~~~
        at asset:///lib.deno.web.d.ts:21:15
        'Event' was also declared here.
        interface Event {
                  ~~~~~
            at asset:///lib.dom.d.ts:5285:11    and here.
        declare var Event: {
                    ~~~~~
            at asset:///lib.dom.d.ts:5353:13
    ...
