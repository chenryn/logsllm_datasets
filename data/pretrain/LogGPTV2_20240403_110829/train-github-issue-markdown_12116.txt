### Update Request

I encountered numerous TypeScript (TS) errors when attempting to include type definitions for the `ky` library using the `@deno-types` directive. 

Here is the code snippet that caused the issues:

```typescript
// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/ky@v0.23.0/index.d.ts"
export { default as ky } from "https://deno.land/x/ky@v0.23.0/index.js";
```

The error messages indicate that there are conflicts with the `lib.dom.d.ts` file, specifically with the `Event` interface and class. The duplicate identifier `Event` is causing the following errors:

```plaintext
TS2300 [ERROR]: Duplicate identifier 'Event'.
declare class Event {
    ~~~~~
at asset:///lib.deno.web.d.ts:21:15
'Event' was also declared here.
interface Event {
    ~~~~~
at asset:///lib.dom.d.ts:5285:11
and here.
declare var Event: {
    ~~~~~
at asset:///lib.dom.d.ts:5353:13
...
```

This issue seems to be related to overlapping declarations in the `lib.dom.d.ts` and `lib.deno.web.d.ts` files.
