User: I need to restart the celery daemon but I need it to tell the current workers to shutdown as their tasks complete and then spin up a new set of workers while the old ones are still shutting down.
The current graceful option on the daemon waits for all tasks to complete before restarting which is not useful when you have long running jobs. 
Please do not suggest autoreload as it is currently undocumented in 4.0.2.
Assistant: We have tasks that may run up to 48 hours. Graceful restart you talk about is very common when we have a new release and we deploy the new version to production. What we do is simply send the SIGTERM (shutdown) signal to the running workers, and then spin up completely new set of workers in parallel.
