User: I just downloaded and installed Python 2.7.2 to my laptop and I am trying to run some sample programs. My laptop is running Windows XP.
When I open a cmd window and type python I get:

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

I am not a Windows person (mostly mainframes). However I am guessing that there is some command that I need to execute to define python as a command. Can anyone tell me what that command is?
The installer placed Python at C:\Python27\.
Assistant: I had the same problem for a long time. 
I just managed to resolve it. 
So, you need to select your Path, like the others said above.
What I did:
Open a command window. Write set path=C:\Python24 (put the location and the version for your python). Now type python, It should work.
The annoying part with this is that you have to type it every time you open the CMD.
I tried to do the permanent one (with the changes in the Environmental variables) but for me its not working.
