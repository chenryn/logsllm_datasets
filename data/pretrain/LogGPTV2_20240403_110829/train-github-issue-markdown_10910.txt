**Current behavior**  
When processing data I ran into error originating from accessing a variable
with undefined as its value. However this error does not make it to the
console. The rendering of the view stops and nothing happens. There is nothing
on the console.  
Debugging the issue with the Developer Tools in chrome I could see that the
error is thrown and it goes to core.es5.js in
@angular/core/@angular/core.es5.js => callWithDebugContext() @ Line number
13054.  
Whenever the errors are not propagating to the console I can debug that the
state of the view is 2 in the variable _currentView.
Note:  
The project was initially created from the Angular Seed Project which was
running Angular 2.4.x. Recently I ported the entire application to Angular CLI
1.0.0 running Angular 4.0.0. Earlier the same issue happened where there was
no issue in the console but the page was not loading (in Angular 4 / Angular-
CLI 1). When investigating it was some old code present in the previous
version running on Angular 2.4.x that was causing the issue and I found this
out when trying to run the application on the previous versions and that
caused errors on the console which I fixed in the new version (Running Angular
4)
**Expected behavior**  
For any such TypeErrors the message has to propagate to the console ( when no
user written catch block is specified ).
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
I am finding it hard to reproduce in a new project since my current project is
fairly large.
