reports, and then compare it with our detected outbound attacks.
Since these incident reports come from Internet users’ complaints,
there is a large number of short-term transient attacks that are not
covered by these reports. Therefore, we focus on the false negatives
of those attacks that we missed in our approach when we compare
with incident reports, rather than those attacks that we detect but
are missed in these reports. For those attacks that are not covered
by the incident reports, we randomly picked a few attacks for each
type and investigated them. The attacks for which the packet traces
got logged were veriﬁed as being mitigated by the security team.
Table 2 shows the number of incident reports (labeled as “at-
tacks”) and those that are also detected by our approach. We detect
most of the attacks reported in the incident reports (83.7%). There
are only two exceptions: (1) There are some incident reports about
application-level attacks such as phishing and malware hosting that
we cannot detect with network signatures. (2) We only investigate
brute-force attacks on three remote communication protocols (SSH,
RDP, VNC). Therefore we miss brute-force attacks on other proto-
cols such as FTP.3 There are four incident reports labeled as “no
attacks” that are also covered by our detected attacks. We investi-
gated these attacks manually and conﬁrmed with the security team
that they are real attacks (on TCP SYN ﬂoods, SSH and RDP brute-
force attacks) but mislabeled. Our analysis has been leveraged by
the cloud security team towards improving attack detection, reduc-
ing time to detect, and identifying correlations across attack types.
Limitations of NetFlow. Due to coarse-grained sampling in the
NetFlow data collected for our study and the fact that NetFlow lacks
application-level information, we do not aim at identifying all the
attacks in the cloud. We may miss application-level attacks with-
out network-level signatures and those attacks that do not appear

volved in the brute-force attacks.
173in sampled NetFlow (e.g., HTTP Slowloris [24]). Instead, our goal
is to understand what we can learn about cloud attacks with low
overhead network-level information.
Although we just detect a subset of attacks due to the conser-
vative approach, it is still useful to understand the key characteris-
tics of these attacks to shed light on the effectiveness of commer-
cial attack-protection appliances, and the implications on designing
future attack detection and protection solutions. Studies [12, 22,
34] have shown that sampled NetFlow does not affect the detection
accuracy of ﬂood attacks but it may underestimate the number of
ﬂows. Therefore, the number of ﬂows we report should be viewed
as a lower bound on the number in the original trafﬁc.
4. ANALYSIS OF ATTACKS BY VIP
In our three-month trace data, there are on average 0.08% of VIPs
per day under inbound attacks and 0.11% of VIPs per day generat-
ing outbound attacks. In this section we investigate these VIPs to
understand the attack frequency per VIP, multi-vector attacks on
the same VIP, inbound and outbound attacks on the same VIP, and
attacks that involve multiple VIPs.
4.1 Attack frequency per VIP
Attack frequency per VIP: We count the number of attacks per
VIP per day (Figure 3a). Most VIPs experiencing attacks only in-
cur one attack incident during a day. Out of the 13K (VIP, day) pairs
experiencing inbound attacks, 53% of pairs experience only one at-
tack in a day. Out of 18K (VIP, day) pairs experiencing outbound
attacks, 44% generate only one attack in a day because the misbe-
having instances are aggressively shut down by the cloud security
team.
At the tail, a VIP can get 39 inbound attacks in a day. This is
a VIP hosting Media and HTTP services receiving frequent ﬂood
attacks (i.e., SYN, UDP, ICMP) with a median duration of 6 min-
utes and a median inter-arrival time of 64 minutes. For outbound
attacks, there are 0.05% of outbound (VIP, day) pairs generating
more than 100 attacks. We observed one VIP that generated more
than 144 outbound TCP SYN ﬂood attacks in a day to many web
servers in the Internet with a median duration of 1 minute and a me-
dian inter-arrival time of 10 minutes. This VIP did not receive any
inbound trafﬁc during a whole month in the NetFlow data indicat-
ing that this VIP does not likely host any legitimate cloud service
but it is only being used for malicious behavior.
VIPs with frequent and occasional attacks: We observed that
there are only a few VIPs getting more than 10 attacks (2% of the
inbound pairs and 5% of the outbound pairs). Therefore, we classify
the VIPs into two classes: those VIPs with no more than 10 attacks
per day and those with more than 10 attacks per day. Understanding
the VIPs under frequent attacks is important for operators to extract
the right attack signatures (e.g., popular attack sources) to protect
these VIPs from future attacks.
Figure 3 shows that for inbound attacks, there are more TDS,
port scan, and brute-force attacks for those VIPs with occasional
attacks than those with frequent attacks (26.6% vs. 0% for TDS,
20.1% vs. 1.84% for port scan, and 15.7% vs. 0.359% for brute-
force). It is natural for port scan and brute-force attacks to target
VIPs with occasional attacks because these attacks search widely
for vulnerabilities (e.g., open ports, weak passwords). TDS attacks
also interact more with VIPs with occasional attacks, which makes
TDS attacks harder to detect. Our further investigation shows that
these occasional attacks mainly target applications running proto-
cols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMTP, and SSH.

(b) Inbound attacks for VIPs with occasional/frequent attacks.
(c) Outbound attacks for VIPs with occasional/frequent attacks.
Figure 3: Attack characterization for VIPs with inbound and out-
bound attacks; the x-axis is on log-scale in the top ﬁgure.
VIPs under frequent attacks often experience relatively more TCP
SYN ﬂood attacks than those VIPs under occasional attacks (5.3%
vs. 1.4%). Our investigation shows that these frequent ﬂood attacks
often target several popular cloud services on these VIPs including
streaming applications, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.
Similarly, for outbound attacks, the VIPs with occasional attacks
experience more brute-force, TDS, and spam attacks than the VIPs
with frequent attacks (19.4% vs. 1.97% for brute-force, 12.8% vs.
0% for TDS, and 4.7% vs. 0.119% for spam). While attackers

may try to use free-trials or create fake accounts to launch them,
the attack activity is only short-lived because the anomalous VMs
are aggressively shut down by the cloud operators. It is challenging
to detect these attacks because they come from multiple VIPs in
the case of occasional attacks (e.g., spam) and they typically last
only a short time.
In contrast, those VIPs with frequent attacks
are often the sources for TCP SYN and UDP ﬂood attacks. For a
few cases, we manually veriﬁed that these VIPs have compromised
VMs, which may be sold in the underground economy [23, 49].
Fraction of VIP’s lifetime involved in inbound attacks: We in-
vestigated the fraction of the time a VIP is under inbound attacks or
generating outbound attacks compared to its total active time (i.e.,
the time that the VIP has active trafﬁc). Figure 4 shows that 50%
of VIPs experience inbound attacks for 0.2% of their active times.
These are occasional attacks that do not likely affect much of their
service. However, 3% of the VIPs receive inbound attack more than
50% of their operating time. Further investigation reveals that these
VIPs run media, web, mail, and database services. Cloud operators
need to effectively block these attacks to eliminate their impact on
cloud services.
Compromised VIPs vs. malicious VIPs for outbound attacks:
We also study the fraction of time a VIP generates outbound attacks
compared to its active time. Note that most of these compromised
VMs had weak passwords highlighting the need to enforce security
best practices such as conﬁguring cryptographically strong pass-
words. Figure 4 shows that 50% of VIPs generate outbound attacks
for 1.2% of their active times. These VIPs are likely legitimate
tenants that may have been compromised by attackers to generate
outbound attacks occasionally (see Section 4.2 for one such exam-
ple). In contrast, 8% of attack VIPs generate outbound attack for
more than 50% of their active times. These VIPs are likely to be
recruited mainly for attacks e.g., attackers may buy compromised
VMs in the cloud or leverage free trial accounts.
4.2 Attacks on the same VIP
Multi-vector attacks: We observe multiple types of attacks attack-
ing the same VIP or coming from the same VIP at the same time.
This is likely because a single malicious program tries to launch
multiple types of attacks to exploit the vulnerabilities of targets or
to exhaust target resources in different ways. We identify these at-
tacks if their start times to/from the same VIP differ less than ﬁve
minutes. We ﬁnd that 106 VIPs experience more than one type of
inbound attacks simultaneously, which accounts for 6.1% of the to-
tal inbound attacks. There are 74 VIPs that experience more than

timate the UDP throughput and the upper bound of the number of
RDP connections based on the 1 in 4096 sampling rate.
one type of outbound attacks simultaneously, which accounts for
0.83% of the total outbound attacks. Among these VIPs, 46 VIPs
are targets of multi-vector volume-based attacks (i.e., TCP SYN,
UDP, ICMP ﬂoods, and DNS reﬂection). There are 11 VIPs that
launch multi-vector outbound volume-based attacks.
A new observation we make about outbound attacks is that there
are 35 VIPs which launch brute-force attacks together with TCP
SYN and ICMP ﬂood attacks (which account for 22.3% of the out-
bound multi-vector attacks). This is likely a new attack pattern that
attackers ﬁnd effective in breaking Internet hosts.
Inbound and outbound attacks on the same VIP. There are also
several cases of simultaneous inbound and outbound attacks. Fig-
ure 5 shows one such case. A VIP from a partner subscription was
inactive (i.e., no trafﬁc) for a long time. Starting the second day,
the VIP started to receive inbound RDP brute-force attack for more
than a week. These brute-force attacks originated from 85 Internet
hosts, where 70.3% of attack packets are from three IP addresses
within a single resident AS in Asia. These brute-force attack had a
peak of estimated around 70 K ﬂows per minute with a few packets
sampled in each ﬂow. On the eighth day, the VIP started to gener-
ate outbound UDP ﬂoods against 491 external sites. The outbound
UDP attack had a peak volume at 23 Kpps, lasting for more than
two days. Detecting such attacks requires ﬁrst jointly analyzing the
inbound and outbound trafﬁc to identify the attack patterns of com-
promised VIPs, and then blocking their outbound trafﬁc.
4.3 Attacks on multiple VIPs
If attacks of the same type start on multiple VIPs simultaneously,
it is likely that these attacks are controlled by the same attacker.
We identify attacks on multiple VIPs if the difference of their start
times on different VIPs is less than ﬁve minutes.4
Figure 6 shows that most types of attacks are targeted by fewer
than 10 VIPs in the 99th percentile. We also observe that most types
of attacks are targeted at only one VIP in the median (not shown in
the ﬁgure). Inbound brute-force attacks have simultaneous attacks
on 53 VIPs in the 99th percentile and 66 VIPs in the peak. We
investigated the attacks at the tail and ﬁnd that there are two Internet
hosts from small cloud providers that start attacking 66 VIPs at the
same time, and move to other VIPs. During a single day, these two
4We choose ﬁve minutes because the ramp-up time is 1-3 minutes
for ﬂood attacks and the inactive time TI (deﬁned in Section 2) for
other attacks is larger than 10 minutes.

Figure 7: Median and maximum aggregate throughput by attack
type; the y-axis is on log-scale.
Internet hosts attack more than 500 VIPs. These VIPs are located in
ﬁve data centers in the cloud, and they belong to 8 IP subnets with
different sizes (/17 to /21). The attacker scans through the entire
IP subnet with up to 114.5 Kpps attack trafﬁc per VIP. To prevent
such attacks, we need to correlate the trafﬁc to different VIPs and
coordinate their attack detection and mitigation.
For outbound attacks, UDP ﬂood, spam, brute-force, and SQL at-
tacks involve around 20 VIPs simultaneously in the 99th percentile.
In the peak, UDP ﬂood and brute-force attacks involve more than
40 VIPs simultaneously.
4.4 Cloud services under inbound attack
We now investigate the major types of cloud services under in-
bound attacks. We capture the NetFlow records for VIPs receiving
inbound attacks. We then ﬁlter all the attack trafﬁc from the trafﬁc
on the VIPs, and the remaining trafﬁc on the VIPs is mostly legiti-
mate trafﬁc. We use the destination port of inbound trafﬁc to infer
what type of applications and services are hosted on the VIPs. We
count the application type if the trafﬁc on the application port ex-
ceeds ten percent of its total trafﬁc. Table 3 shows the percentage of
VIPs with different types of cloud services that experience different
types of inbound attacks.
Web services (HTTP/HTTPS) are major services in the cloud
with 99% of the total trafﬁc. VIPs hosting these web services re-
ceive a wide range of attacks such as SYN ﬂoods, ICMP ﬂoods,
brute-force attacks, port scan, and TDS attacks. Web services re-
ceive the largest number of SYN attacks which aim to consume all
the available connections of application servers. 1.2% of the SYN
ﬂoods use source port 1024 and 3072, which are likely caused by
a bug from an old SYN ﬂood tool juno [9]. Blacklisting or rate-
limiting these ports can help mitigate SYN ﬂoods.
We also observe other non-ﬂood attacks targeting speciﬁc types
of services. For instance, there are 35.06% VIPs hosting RDP
servers with standard RDP port. The attackers often detect ac-
tive RDP ports and then generate brute-force attacks against the
server. TDS attacks mostly target VIPs running web services and
mail services for spam, malware spreading, and malicious advertis-
ing. There are 6.94% of VIPs under attack running web services
and 1.75% of VIPs running mail services.
5. ATTACK CHARACTERIZATION
We next investigate the characteristics of attacks to derive impli-
cations for the design of attack detection and prevention systems.
First, to quantify the cloud bandwidth capacity needed to defend
against attacks, we study the throughput of different types of at-
tacks. Second, to understand how fast the attack detection system
needs to react to attacks, we study the duration, ramp-up rate, and
inter-arrival times of different types of attacks.
5.1 Attack throughput
Throughput by attack type: Figure 7 shows the median and peak
aggregate throughput over the entire cloud for each type of attack
and all the attacks overall. We measure the attack throughput using
packets per second (pps) because the resources (CPU and memory)
used to prevent these attacks are often correlated to the trafﬁc rate.
The overall inbound attack throughput has a median of 595 Kpps
and a peak of 9.4 Mpps. The overall outbound attack throughput is
lower with a median of 662 Kpps and a peak of 2.25 Mpps. Com-
pared to the average throughput of legitimate trafﬁc (54.3 Mpps for
inbound and 49.7 Mpps for outbound), the median attack through-
put is about 1% of the total trafﬁc. These attacks can have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on both the cloud infrastructure (ﬁrewalls, load bal-
ancers) and services hosted in the cloud if we do not ﬁlter them at
the network edge.
We now study the peak volumes of individual attacks to under-
stand the resources we need to protect against them. TCP SYN
ﬂoods have a peak throughput of 1.7 Mpps for inbound and 184
Kpps for outbound. It is important to prevent these attacks timely
(e.g., using SYN cookies) before they exhaust many resources in
the cloud infrastructure such as load balancers and ﬁrewalls.
The peak throughput for inbound UDP ﬂoods is 9.2 Mpps while
that of outbound UDP ﬂoods is 1.6 Mpps. While these ﬂood attacks
aim to consume the cloud bandwidth or cause congestion to de-
grade service performance, the cloud networks are provisioned with
a high network capacity to defend against them [7, 14]. Given that
a software load balancer (SLB) can handle 300 Kpps per core [42]
for simple Layer 4 packet processing, in the worst case handling
inbound UDP ﬂoods may waste 31 extra cores in the data center
infrastructure. If we fail to do in-network ﬁltering of these UDP
ﬂoods, they would cost even more resources per packet in the VMs
which have more complex packet processing. However, detecting
some application-level attacks (e.g., brute-force, spam), endpoint
based approaches can leverage application semantics to better han-
dle them compared to in-network defense approaches.
We also observe large variations in attack volumes over time. For
inbound attacks, port scan has 1000x difference between the peak
