Certainly! Here is a more professional and clear version of the text:

---

**Log Entry:**
- **Source:** qa.sockets.stackexchange.com:443
- **Error Message:** Could not connect to proxy `proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070`
- **Error Code:** 10061

**Template:**
- **Source:** <*Host*>:*<Port>*
- **Error Message:** Could not connect to proxy <*Proxy Host*>:*<Proxy Port>*
- **Error Code:** <*Error Code>*

---

This format clearly separates the specific log entry from the template, making it easier to understand and use.
