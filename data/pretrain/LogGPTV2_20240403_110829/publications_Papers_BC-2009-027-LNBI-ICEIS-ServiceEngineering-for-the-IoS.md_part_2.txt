Fig. 2. Relationships between Business Service, e-Service and Web Service
2.3 Atomic vs. Composite Services
The vision of marketplaces for services was previously described by [11]. They de-
scribe two steps in the evolution of marketplaces for offering services. As a first step
basic services are offered on an electronic marketplace. The focus is on making ser-
vices available via a new medium – the Internet – as opposed to the real world.
Advanced mechanisms for searching and finding suitable services based on their
properties were created and support for automatic negotiation of provisioning terms
between the service provider and the service consumer was established. Consumers
were able to create a one-to-one relationship with a provider. As a second step more
complex relationships between consumers and providers are to be formed. Basic
services can, in many cases, only provide basic functionality. To provide more com-
plex functionality, composite services may be created from basic services or other

composite services and offered on the marketplace. This might mean that there is a
need for interaction of the different services with each other.
In the scope of our work we are striving for the second step. There will not only be
service providers and service consumers involved in business interactions. A further
role often called service aggregator will be performed by entities that specialize on
combining services into more complex service compositions or bundles which are
then offered on the marketplace to be found and used by service consumers. While the
aggregated services are sold to the service consumers by the aggregator, the individ-
ual parts they consist of (atomic services or other service compositions) will be pro-
vided by their original providers who will receive a payment from the aggregator. The
added value created by the service aggregator stems from the selection and composi-
tion of available services into more complex services or bundles which constitute an
advantage for the consumer.
Aspects of service supply and demand such as service discovery, monitoring,
charging and payment as well as publishing, composition, and re-provisioning (leas-
ing, licensing) that are important for the different stakeholders (service providers,
aggregators and clients) need to be regulated by the service marketplace [2]. In order
to do so, service marketplaces need to provide a broad range of functionality which
we will describe in more detail in the next section of this paper.
3 Requirements for the IoS and Marketplaces
Marketplaces, as enabler of the IoS vision, need to offer complex functionality for
bringing together a large number of consumers, aggregators, and providers and enable
the means for business interactions among them. Service providers offer their services
on the marketplace. Consumers select services from different providers based on
functionality, best pricing, offered quality of service, or rating. After the service has
been selected, it is delivered by the provider. Finally, the client will have to pay a due
amount for the service consumption. In order to pave the path for the IoS there is a
need for identifying and understanding the underlying challenges that need to be ad-
dress to provide solutions realizing the vision. The IoS bridges business and IT infra-
structures perspectives. As a result, IoS requirements need to have a strong emphasis
on the business and IT sides. Therefore, the following topics need to be analyzed,
studied and framed within the IoS:
Legal and Community Aspects, and Business Models. The implications of business
value networks need to be studied from a legal perspective. The combination and
integration of world-wide regulations is fundamental. A special emphasis has to be
given to the generation of new business models for all stakeholders (i.e., service pro-
viders, aggregators, and consumers) and corresponding incentive mechanisms. Com-
munity aspects encourage cooperation and boost innovations through the extensive
exchange of knowledge.
Service Search based on Advanced Service Description. Marketplaces need to
offer search mechanisms that allow for heterogeneous search criteria. At the base for
such search mechanisms, a framework for describing different aspects of services is
needed. A suitable service description framework covers not only the functional de-
scription of a service but also aspects such as pricing, quality of service, user rating,
Service Engineering for the Internet of Services 21
and legal aspects among others. Consumers will be able to search for service func-
tionality based on functional classifications such as UN/SPSC or eCl@ss [5] or natu-
ral language based descriptions. The search results may then be further refined taking
into consideration a large variety of non-functional properties, thus leading to im-
proved search results [8].
Negotiation of Service Level Agreements (SLA). Prior to interacting with a service,
the consumer needs to create an agreement with the service provider stating the terms
under which the service need to be provided. Rights as well as obligations of both
parties regarding the service consumption will be described. The aspects specified in
an SLA (e.g. QoS and pricing) will be derived from the service description as it pro-
vides the base for negotiation.
Service Monitoring. In order to enable trust among the participants of a business
interaction, there is a need for monitoring the interaction. The goal is to make sure
that service providers deliver the service under the terms promised to the consumer.
The monitoring of functionality may be provided by the marketplace itself or by a
trusted third party (e.g. a monitoring service). The base for the monitoring is the SLA
negotiated between the provider and the consumer.
Billing and Payment. Consumers need to pay for the services they have consumed.
The marketplace needs to provide the means to assure that clients pay the correct
amount of money. An invoice will be created based on the usage information gathered
during the interaction with services. During the payment process, a consumer will
need to transfer the amount due according to a predefined payment method. Billing
and payment functionality may be provided either by the marketplace or by a third
party service.
Service Governance. Governance addresses the strategic alignment between business
services and business requirements thereby reducing risks and assuring compliance
with rules and regulations. The ability to freely compose and orchestrate business func-
tions which are available as services on a diversity of marketplaces bears overwhelm-
ing opportunities. Trust and trustworthiness of service offerings must be facilitated by
the platform, balancing individual requirements, policies, and must be capable of
adapting to the given business context.
Service Delivery Platform. An infrastructure for service delivery has to be provided
for technically enabling businesses to engage in business transactions. This infrastruc-
ture has to be scalable with respect to complexity, i.e., its consumers must be able to
counter the intricacies of distributed systems. Platform services need to be provided
directly by the platform. These fundamental services include brokering, mediation,
billing, security and trust services.
Service Engineering. Service engineering (SE) is a new approach to the analysis,
design and implementation of service-based ecosystems in which organizations and
IT provide value for others in the form of services. SE not only provides methodolo-
gies to handle the increased complexity of numerous business actors and their value
exchanges, but also provides tools for constructing and deploying services that merge
the IT and business perspectives.

These requirements are a basis for the TEXO project [14] which main goal is to
develop new business models for the Web. It targets the development of an (open)
platform for the development, distribution and provision of (business) services. While
all these topics are important to support the vision of the IoS, in this paper we will
concentrate our study on the emerging research discipline termed Service Engineer-
ing. The ISE methodology, which we describe in the next section, provides the means
for suppliers of services to create new services.
4 Service Engineering
One recent development that is believed to allow organizations to support the notion
of IoS is the adoption of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). The OASIS SOA
Reference Model defines SOA as “a paradigm for organizing and utilizing distributed
capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership domains” [9]. With
SOA, designers of services are facing the challenge of gaining a deep understanding
of the business for which they are developing solutions with the right scope and
granularity. Designing services is not only a technical undertaking; it is the job of
analyzing the business environment and business processes, and identifying business
functions that could be implemented as a service. It should be noticed that it is fre-
quently impossible to implement an innovative business model without, eventually,
rely on the underlying IT infrastructure. This constitutes a major problem since there
is a considerable gap between these two complementary worlds. Therefore, one chal-
lenge lies on bridging the gap between business and IT. This challenge requires a set
of design principles, patterns, and techniques that has not been precisely identified
yet. Therefore, the IoS cannot be realized without giving a strong emphasis on the
business side of services.
4.1 Definition
The set of activities involved in the development of service-based solutions in a sys-
tematic and disciplined way that span, and take into account, business and technical
perspectives can be referred to as service engineering.
“Service Engineering is an approach that provides a discipline for using models and
techniques to guide the understanding, structure, design, implementation, deployment,
documentation, operation, maintenance and modification of electronic services
(e-services).”
Service Engineering is a structured approach for describing a part of an organization
from a service perspective that expresses the way the organization works. The ap-
proach should systematically translate an initial description from a natural language
that expresses the way stakeholders think and communicate about the organization
through a sequence of representations using various models to a representation that is
accepted and understood. Developing and implementing services is a major chore for
organizations. Dealing with hundreds of services may be seen, from a management
point-of-view, as difficult as managing hundreds of human resources inside an or-
ganization, requiring a dedicated department, specialized staff, and adequate
methodologies.

4.2 The ISE Methodology
Compared to other approaches, the methodology which we are developing (the ISE
methodology), not only focuses on a technical perspective, but also focuses on a deep
and prominent business perspective when developing services for the IoS. Since the
notions of abstraction (perspective) and dimensions (entities) were important for our
approach, we have followed an solution based on the Zachman framework [16] to
support service engineering.
