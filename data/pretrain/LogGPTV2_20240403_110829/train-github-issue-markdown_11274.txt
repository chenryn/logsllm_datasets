# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
My use for PowerToys run would be primarily as an app switcher, secondarily as
an app launcher. Since the options to launch new instances also have the two
context buttons, I have to press tab 3 times to get to the option to switch to
the running instance.
There should be a setting that allows you to always prioritize the results
which switch to already-running applications.
