User: So for some reason, my computer refuses to see the environment PATH variable. In the path variable, I have:
C:\Python32;
listed, along with all of the other programs, but it doesn't work if I type, "python" into the command window. However, I can type "python" into the run window, and have it run the correct interpreter (I assume because I have an environment variable for that separately...? As you can see, I don't quite understand how to customize this stuff. Any help would be appreciated!
Assistant: I know it's been a while, but I hope this could help someone else.
I had the same problem and the only way to making it work was running cmd or powershell as administrator.
