**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `makecab` command is used to package existing files into a cabinet (.cab) file. This command is functionally equivalent to the `diantz` command.

**Syntax:**
```sh
makecab [/v[n]] [/d var=value] [/l directory] [source_file] [destination_file]
makecab [/v[n]] [/d var=value] /f directive_file [...]
```

**Parameters:**

- **`source_file`**:
  - Description: The file to be compressed.
  
- **`destination_file`** (optional):
  - Description: The name to give the compressed file. If this parameter is omitted, the last character of the source file name will be replaced with an underscore (`_`) and used as the destination file name.
  
- **`/f directive_file`**:
  - Description: A file containing makecab directives. This parameter can be repeated to include multiple directive files.
  
- **`/d var=value`**:
  - Description: Defines a variable with the specified value.
  
- **`/l directory`**:
  - Description: Specifies the location where the destination file should be placed. The default is the current directory.
  
- **`/v[n]`**:
  - Description: Sets the debugging verbosity level. The levels are as follows:
    - `0`: No debugging output.
    - `1`: Minimal debugging output.
    - `2`: Moderate debugging output.
    - `3`: Full debugging output.
  
- **`/?`**:
  - Description: Displays help information for the `makecab` command at the command prompt.

**Example:**
```sh
makecab /v3 /d MyVar=MyValue /l C:\Output my_source_file.txt my_destination_file.cab
```

This example sets the verbosity level to 3, defines a variable `MyVar` with the value `MyValue`, specifies the output directory as `C:\Output`, and compresses `my_source_file.txt` into `my_destination_file.cab`.

By using `makecab`, you can efficiently create .cab files for various purposes, such as software distribution or data archiving.
