  1. Run Gallery -> Text fields
  2. Rotate into landscape mode
  3. Enter some text into the Name field and dismiss the keyboard
  4. Scroll to the bottom of the form, and then scroll back to the top. The Name field will now be blank.
I noticed that the framework is disposing the EditableTextState when the field
scrolls out of view. Is that a new behavior and is it intentional?
EditableTextState.dispose() also hides the keyboard, so the dispose might be
causing other bugs related to showing/hiding the keyboard during scrolling and
relayout (#9221, #9231)
