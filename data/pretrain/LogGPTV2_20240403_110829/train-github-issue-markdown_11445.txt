All input types get set to 210px wide and 18px high, which means image buttons
get squashed ridiculously. Adding the radiused box-shadow border doesn't make
much sense for image buttons either.
It may be too much to set those values for the individual input types since
there are a number of nonstandard ones that different browsers and platforms
support, but Bootstrap could at least reset height and width to auto on
input[type="image"], and the fancy border stuff to none.
