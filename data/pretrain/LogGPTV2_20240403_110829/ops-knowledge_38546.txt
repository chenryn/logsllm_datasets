User: How to execute multiple commands on the Linux command line?
Assistant: The following methods can be used to execute multiple commands at the same time on the Linux command line: 1. Use a semicolon `;` to connect multiple commands. For example: ``` command1 ; command2 ; command3 ``` This will execute three commands in sequence. 2. Use double vertical bars `||` to connect multiple commands. If the execution of the previous command fails, the next command will be executed. For example: ``` command1 || command2 || command3 ``` If `command1` fails, execute `command2`, and if `command2` also fails, execute `command3`. 3. Use the double ampersand `&&` to connect multiple commands. If the previous command is executed successfully, the next command will be executed. For example: ``` command1 && command2 && command3 ``` If `command1` executes successfully, execute `command2`, if `command2` also executes successfully, execute `command3`.
