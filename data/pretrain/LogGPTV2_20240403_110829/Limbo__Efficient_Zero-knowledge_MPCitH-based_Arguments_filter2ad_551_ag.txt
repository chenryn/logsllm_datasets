Table 6: Performance for proving matrix multiplication with sound-
ness 2−40 with 𝑛 = 8
7.4 Comparison with related works
We compare the performance of our scheme with the most ef-
ficient MPCitH schemes for circuit satisfiability, namely Ligero
(shortest communication), and KKW (fastest run times). Ligero [2]
uses soundness error 2−40, so we compare it with our interactive
argument. Table 3 gives performance figures of our interactive
system for different parameters achieving 40-bit of security. Com-
paring these with Ligero, our system gives both better run times
and proof size for circuit up to roughly 218 multiplication gates.
For 220 AND gates, Ligero requires more than 10 sec, whereas for
the same circuit, Limbo only needs 3 sec; Ligero++, which supports
R1CS, reported prover’s running times about 2x slower than Ligero.
For larger circuits the communication complexity of Ligero and
Ligero++ is smaller than that of our protocol.
We also compare with KKW [30], which has better computa-
tional performance than Ligero. For the parameters given in [30],
we observe (Table 3) that our protocol offers shorter proofs (up
to 2x shorter for large circuits), and faster computation (up to 2x)
assuming the same number of parties and security parameter. A
recent optimized implementation, Reverie, can handle the verifica-
tion of 100 SHA-256 circuits (i.e. 2227200 multiplication gates) in
4.76s. Our current implementation is incomparable with Reverie as
it can be potentially optimised in many ways, however NILimbo
can already prove 221 AND gates in 9.49s (Table 5) with 4 threads.
This is only 2.2 times slower than reported times for Reverie on a
32-core machine, which also has a proof size of 22MB compared to
14MB for NILimbo. We plan to further optimise our implementation
in future works.
We also stress that our system is, in theory, more efficient when
used for arithmetic circuits, and that we could further improve
our run times by choosing different values for the compression
parameter 𝑘, for example larger for larger circuits. We also plan to
perform more tests in these directions.
