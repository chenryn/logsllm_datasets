cryptographically signed enrollment records. We’ve demon-
strated the approach to work on a large population of two
different chips, have used different models of low-cost micro-
scope cameras, and have evaluated resiliency of ﬁngerprints.
Crucially, we’ve shown that even an adversary possessing an
exact duplicate of the mold used to produce a chip’s package
will not easily be able to create a high-quality counterfeit of
the chip.
