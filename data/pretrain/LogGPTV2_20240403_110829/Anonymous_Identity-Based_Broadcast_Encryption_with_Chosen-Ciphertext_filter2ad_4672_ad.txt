with a non-negligible advantage, then C also have a non-negligible advantage
to break the ANO-CCA security or WROB-CCA security of the IBE scheme.
However, the IBE scheme is ANO-CCA secure and WROB-CCA secure. Hence,
Game2 and Game3 are computationally indistinguishable.
Lemma 4. Suppose that DBDH assumption holds, then Game3 and Game4 are
computationally indistinguishable.
Proof. The case for distinguishing Game3 from Game4 is symmetric with the
case for distinguishing Game1 from Game2.
Lemma 5. Suppose that the signature scheme Σ is a strong one-time signature
scheme, then Game4 and Game5 are computationally indistinguishable.
Proof. The case for distinguishing Game4 from Game5 is symmetric with the
case for distinguishing Game0 from Game1.
4 Comparisons
In this section, we compare the security and performance among the existing
anonymous IBBE schemes and our concrete instantiation from our generic IBBE
construction which is presented in Appendix A. The results of comparisons are
presented in Table 1.
In Table 1, it shows that the constructions [14,29] and the ﬁrst construction
[39] have some security ﬂaws in their security proofs. As constructions [11,29]
both pointed out construction [14] does not achieve anonymity. Constructions
[22,35] both pointed out construction [29] does not achieve anonymity. Con-
struction [36] gave an insider attack about anonymity for the ﬁrst scheme of
[39]. Construction [11] and the second construction [39] do not have security
proofs. Construction [32] is only an outsider-anonymous IBBE with adaptive
CPA security in standard model. Constructions [20,26,38] are all CPA, while
our construction can simultaneously ensure the conﬁdentiality and anonymity
under chosen-ciphertext attacks. In particular, our scheme is not less eﬃcient
than these existing IBBE schemes, although all of them cannot obtain the same
security as ours. Thus, the comparison results indicate that our concrete IBBE
scheme has a better overall security and performance. The symbol “×” means
there exists some security ﬂaws or problems in their security proofs and “−”
means there is no security proof in the scheme.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a generic IBBE scheme from a generic anonymous
IBE construction. The generic IBBE scheme obtains the conﬁdentiality and
anonymity against chosen-ciphertext attacks simultaneously. In addition, the
scheme has a desirable property, that is the public parameters size, the private
key size and the decryption cost are constant and independent of the number
of receivers. However, our construction is proved in the random oracle model.
So our future work is to construct a generic anonymous IBBE construction with
chosen-ciphertext security in the standard model.

A A Concrete Instantiation
We shall present a concrete instantiation based on the generic IBBE construc-
tion, employing Boneh-Franklin IBE scheme [8], which is IND-CCA secure and
ANO-CCA secure as noticed in [1] and WROB-CCA secure as noticed in [2]
and a concrete signature scheme, e.g. [27] which is a strong one-time signature
scheme Σ = (Gen, Sig, Ver).
Setup(1λ): On input of a security parameter λ, it ﬁrst chooses a bilinear group
G, GT of prime order p with bilinear map e : G × G → GT and a generator
g←RG, and then picks α, β←RZp, computes g1 = gα and g2 = gβ, chooses hash
functions H1 : {0, 1}∗ → G, H2 : {0, 1}(cid:6) × {0, 1}n → Zp, H3 : GT → {0, 1}(cid:6),
: {0, 1}(cid:6) × {0, 1}λ+(cid:6)+n → Zp which

(G, GT , Zp, p, e, g, g1, g2, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5) and the master secret key is msk
= (α, β).
Extract(msk, ID): On input of the master secret key msk and an identity
ID = H1(ID)β. The private key is
ID, it computes sk0
skID = (sk0
ID).
Enc(params, S, M): On input of the public parameters params, a receiver
set S = {ID1, ID2,··· , IDt} and a message M ∈ {0, 1}n,
it ﬁrst runs
(svk, ssk) ← Gen(1λ), chooses δ1, δ2 ←R {0, 1}(cid:6), lets r1 = H2(δ1||M) and
r2 = H5(δ2||svk||δ1 ||M), and then computes T1 = gr1 and T2 = gr2.
For each ID ∈ S,
ID =
ID) = (H3(e(g2, H1(ID))r) ⊕ δ2, H4(δ2) ⊕ (svk||δ1 ||M)). Let C1 =

Dec(skID, CT ): On input of a private key skID and a ciphertext CT , it parses
CT as (svk, σ, T, C1), where C1 = (c0
IDt). If Ver(svk,
ID1 , c1
T1||T2||C1, σ)=0, returns ⊥; else computes c0
