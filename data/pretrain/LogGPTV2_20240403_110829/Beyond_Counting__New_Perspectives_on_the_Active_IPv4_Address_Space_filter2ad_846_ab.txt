### 4. Visibility and Classification of IPv4 Addresses

#### 4.1 Visibility of IPv4 Addresses, Blocks, and Networks
Figure 2(a) illustrates the visibility of IPv4 addresses, /24 blocks, and BGP prefixes in the CDN dataset compared to active measurements (October 2015). The visibility is categorized into unknown, server/router, server, and router IP addresses. The number of IPs (N=77m), /24s (N=495k), BGP prefixes (N=55k), and ASes (N=2k) are shown.

- **Visibility Comparison:**
  - **IPs (N=77m):** Many IPs are not visible in the CDN but are detected via ICMP.
  - **/24s (N=495k):** Aggregating to /24 blocks reduces the discrepancy.
  - **BGP Prefixes (N=55k):** Similar visibility in both methods, with ICMP slightly outperforming the CDN.
  - **ASes (N=2k):** Comparable visibility for both methods.

#### 4.2 Classification of IP Addresses Visible Only in ICMP
Figure 2(b) classifies IP addresses that are visible only in ICMP scans. These IPs are further classified into server, router, and other categories using additional data from ZMap and Ark datasets.

- **Server Identification:** IPs that replied to HTTP(S), SMTP, IMAP(S), or POP3(S) requests.
- **Router Identification:** IPs that appeared in traceroutes and responded with an ICMP TTL Exceeded error.

- **Classification Results:**
  - **Servers and Routers:** Approximately half of the IPs not connected to the CDN can be attributed to servers or infrastructure.
  - **Other IPs:** The remaining half did not show any server or infrastructure activity, suggesting they might be unused, serving other protocols, or simply not connecting to the CDN.

#### 4.3 Geographical View
To understand the geographic coverage of the dataset, we analyzed the visibility of IP addresses by region and country using allocation data from RIRs [25].

- **Regional Visibility (Figure 3(a)):**
  - **CDN and ICMP:** The number of IPs visible in both datasets, only in the CDN, and only in ICMP.
  - **Regional Impact:** The CDN logs provide substantial additional visibility, especially in Africa, where the number of visible active IPs increases by over 150%.

- **Country-Specific Analysis (Figure 3(b)):**
  - **Top Countries:** Ranked by the number of addresses seen in the CDN and ICMP scans, annotated with their rank in broadband and cellular subscribers (ITU, 2015).
  - **ICMP Response Rates:** Varies significantly by country, e.g., 80% in China vs. 25% in Japan.

#### 4.4 Macroscope View of Activity
This section provides a broad-scale analysis of IPv4 address activity, focusing on the number of active IPs and their consistency over time.

- **Daily Activity (Figure 4(a)):**
  - **Active IPs:** Approximately 650M unique active IPv4 addresses daily, with fewer on weekends.
  - **Up/Down Events:** Average of 55M up events and 55M down events per day, indicating significant churn in the active IP population.

- **Volatility Over Time (Figure 4(b)):**
  - **Aggregation Windows:** Non-overlapping windows of different sizes (e.g., 7 days, 26 weeks, 52 weeks).
  - **Churn Analysis:** The percentage of addresses showing up/down events between subsequent windows, indicating that churn persists even at longer timescales.

- **Long-Term Changes (Figure 4(c)):**
  - **Weekly Comparison:** Difference in active IPv4 addresses compared to the first snapshot, highlighting the dynamic nature of the address space over time.

### Conclusion
The analysis reveals significant differences in the visibility of IPv4 addresses between CDN logs and active measurements, with the CDN providing substantial additional coverage, especially in certain regions. The classification of IPs and the geographical distribution provide insights into the nature and location of these addresses, while the volatility analysis underscores the dynamic and transient nature of IP address activity.
