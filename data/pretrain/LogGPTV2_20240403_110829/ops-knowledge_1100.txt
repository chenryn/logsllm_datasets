User:  How to use Nginx to reverse proxy Tomcat server?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use Nginx to reverse proxy Tomcat server: 1. Install Nginx and Tomcat server. Make sure the Tomcat server is running and accessible via the server IP address and port. 2. Edit the Nginx configuration file. Add the following to the Nginx configuration file (usually "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"): ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` 3. Restart the Nginx server. After editing the Nginx configuration file, execute the following command to restart the Nginx server: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` 4. Test whether the reverse proxy works normally. Use a browser to access the IP address or domain name of the server, and you should be able to see the welcome page of the Tomcat server. If you do not see the page, please check whether the Nginx configuration is correct. This completes the steps to use Nginx to reverse proxy the Tomcat server. Reverse proxy can improve the performance and security of Tomcat server, because Nginx can cache requests and filter malicious requests.
