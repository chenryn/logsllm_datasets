### Deep Learning for Networking and Systems
Deep learning is an emerging tool for solving networking and systems problems. Several notable works in this area include:

- **NeuroCuts [34]**: Uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to generate packet classification trees with smaller depth and reduced memory footprint.
- **AuTO [9]**: Scales DRL for datacenter-scale automatic traffic optimization.
- **Pensieve [38]**: Learns adaptive bitrate algorithms for improved video quality.
- **Metis [41]**: Provides interpretability for deep learning-based networking systems.
- **Valadarsky et al. [62]**: Uses DRL for better routing configurations.
- **Yeo et al. [62]**: Utilizes deep learning to reduce dependency on high-quality video delivery.

Other applications of deep learning in networking and systems include congestion control [24], data layouts in big data systems [72], cache admission policy in content delivery networks [30], network resource management [57, 75, 76], scheduling algorithms [17, 39], concurrency control [67], and verification of distributed protocols [73].

**NeuroPlan** applies DRL and combines it with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve the network planning problem.

### Conclusion
We present NeuroPlan, a deep RL approach to solve the network planning problem. NeuroPlan uses a GNN and a domain-specific node-link transformation for state encoding, and leverages a two-stage hybrid approach to find the optimal solution. Evaluation results show that NeuroPlan can reduce the network planning cost by up to 17% compared to hand-tuned heuristics. It also avoids the heavy human effort required to balance optimality and tractability, and is easy to integrate with other heuristics.

Self-driving networks are an emerging trend, and NeuroPlan takes a significant step towards this goal by applying AI techniques to an important network management task—network planning. We hope that NeuroPlan will inspire more work on applying AI techniques to network automation.

This work does not raise any ethical issues.
