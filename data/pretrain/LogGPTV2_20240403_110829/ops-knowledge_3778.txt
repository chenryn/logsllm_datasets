User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the ambient temperature readings from two different software components, node and gige, over a period of 20 days. The temperature readings range from 24 to 34 degrees. There was one warning and one critical log from the gige component.
