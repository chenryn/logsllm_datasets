use. This is probably due to the fact that patients are not ad-
mitted to these wards, they are just there for a short time in
the day, and as such it would make sense to have an access
mechanism in place to handle this.
5.5 Q4: What reasons are provided for us-
ing actualization/emergency access?
Table 7 shows that out of all uses of the actualization
functionality, a self-deﬁned reason was only entered in 1.76
% of the cases. We investigated this number further and
found that out of all the users who had used actualization
functionality in the period only 8% had, at least one time,
provided a self-deﬁned reason for doing so. Actualization
was used a total of 133 918 times, and a self-deﬁned reason
was only provided in 2 357 of these actualization occur-
rences. Several reasons were provided multiple times, so
these 2 357 reasons again map to 730 unique reasons.
These numbers tell us a couple of interesting things. First
of all: the availability of predeﬁned reasons means less spe-
ciﬁc information about why actualization was used. The
predeﬁned reasons are so broadly deﬁned that they convey
very little information about the user’s needs. What we can

see is that signing information in the EPR is a common task,
that should be included in the normal access control regime.
Although the 730 unique reasons provided are too few to
base any quantitative conclusions on, we nevertheless de-
cided to take a closer look, working from the hypotheses
that when users took the trouble to manually enter a reason
they felt that the predeﬁned reasons did not apply to their
situation or did not describe their need accurately. If some
of these manually entered reasons are recurring then this
implies a need shared by several users. 730 entries are so
few that it was possible to examine them one by one and
attempt manual classiﬁcation to see if we could create cat-
egories of recurring reasons or types of reasons. We found
that the most commonly provided reasons are:
• Out-patient clinic patient encounters.
• Physician referrals.
• Hand over patient information to other hospital/health
personnel on request.
• Request for information from a patient or next of kin.
• Release information to other external entity:
insur-
ance, legal, complaints.
• Patient not registered correctly in admin system (re-
sults in access denied, even though patient is physi-
cally present at ward).
As such, these should be considered as candidates for in-
clusion in the normal access control regime and constitute
access control requirements that are not fulﬁlled.
5.6 Q5: What kind of
information is
most often accessed using actualiza-
tion/emergency access?
Table 8 shows how the rate of actualization usage varies
with the document category. The high rate of the top entry
might be explained by the fact that it includes second opin-
ions, where the provider of the opinion might often need
access to the patient record across ward boundaries. The
same type of need could also explain the high rate of the
second entry, which covers reports from physiotherapists,
psychologists and other non-physician specialists. The rel-
atively low rate of the nursing-related entries might be due
to the fact that nurses mostly work with the patients admit-
ted to their working ward.
We also see that image-related lab results have almost
twice the actualization rate of tissue and ﬂuid-related lab re-
sults, perhaps because specialists from other wards are often
called upon to interpret images.
With a more ﬁne-grained and well-structured category
hierarchy, we might have been able to construct a more

5.7 Q6: What
information should be
recorded in access logs to be able to
investigate misuse?
Exception access in some form will always have to be
present in healthcare systems to handle emergencies. There-
fore it is important to have sufﬁcient and usable mechanisms
to trace any misuse.
It is clear from the work presented here that the Do-
cuLive logs do not present sufﬁcient information to effec-
tively investigate suspicions of misuse. We had to combine
data from two separate logs and the user database to be able
to do this work, and still we believe that more information
is required. The main shortcoming is the predeﬁned reasons
for using actualization that mask the real intent.
For an audit trail to be usable it should:
• be available through a usable interface for the admin-
istrators, and
• contain sufﬁciently detailed information to get a pic-
ture of what has happened.
6 Discussion
The system under study here in many ways conforms to
the ideas of optimistic security put forward in [8]. How-
ever, this study illustrates how difﬁcult it is to trace events
in such a system. Being able to trace events is essential to
provide adequate security for systems containing sensitive
health information. Therefore we believe that healthcare
systems require a stricter form of access control, where the
usage of exceptions is minimized. Having examined the au-
dit logs we have found some recurring events fulﬁlled with
actualization, that should be candidates for inclusion in re-
quirements for an access control model that is better suited
for the real needs of the users. Thus this should aid in min-
imizing the use of actualization.
We would also like to point out that when exception
mechanisms are introduced, it is important to have regu-
lations on who should be assigned this permission and to
ensure that these regulations are followed. It should be easy
to obtain an overview over which users, or roles, have the
permission to use exception mechanisms. Minimizing risk
includes minimizing the user base that has the potential for
exploiting exception mechanisms.
Based on this study, we have not been able to conclude
on a ﬁrm set of requirements for access control in healthcare
systems. However, we have identiﬁed some initial require-
ments that we intend to explore further. Most of what we
have seen indicates the need for a more dynamic and user-
controlled access control solution. We believe that RBAC
should be the foundation, but with added ability for han-
dling dynamic events, workﬂow and collaboration. Sev-
eral papers, including [9] [10] [11] have been written on the
concept of role delegation which allows a user to delegate
his/her role to another user. This may be used as a mecha-
nism to handle referrals, second opinions and transfer of pa-
tients. To be able to do this we should introduce the notion
of health personnel-patient relationship, meaning that they
are linked by something more than just a common ward.
We also think the notion of Team-Access Control [12]
centered around a cooperating team seems promising.
Based on our ﬁndings of provided reason, we believe that
the notion of tasks and related responsibilities and duties
provides a promising platform for access control decisions
in healthcare systems.
7 Conclusion and future work
Although we have been able to identify some require-
ments, or initial requirements, in this study, more work
needs to be done. We intend to continue our investigation by
supplementing with data from other systems from the same
period (including admission/discharge dates) to see when
actualization is primarily used. In addition we hope also to
be able to observe healthcare personnel’s information needs
in situations where common tasks need to be performed.
For that purpose, interviews are another possibility we hope
to explore.
