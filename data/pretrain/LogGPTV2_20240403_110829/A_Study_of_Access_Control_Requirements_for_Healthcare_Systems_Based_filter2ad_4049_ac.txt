### 5.5 Q4: Reasons for Using Actualization/Emergency Access

Table 7 indicates that, of all the instances where actualization functionality was used, a self-defined reason was provided in only 1.76% of cases. Further investigation revealed that out of all users who utilized the actualization feature during the study period, only 8% provided a self-defined reason at least once. The total number of actualizations was 133,918, with self-defined reasons given in just 2,357 instances. These 2,357 reasons correspond to 730 unique reasons.

These findings highlight several key points:
- **Predefined Reasons**: The availability of broadly defined, predefined reasons means that specific information about the user's needs is often lacking.
- **Common Tasks**: Signing information in the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) is a frequent task that should be included in the standard access control regime.
- **Manual Entry**: When users took the time to manually enter a reason, it suggests that the predefined reasons did not adequately describe their situation or needs.

The most frequently provided self-defined reasons include:
- Encounters with out-patient clinic patients
- Physician referrals
- Handing over patient information to other hospital/health personnel on request
- Requests for information from patients or next of kin
- Releasing information to external entities such as insurance, legal, or for complaints
- Patients not correctly registered in the administrative system, leading to access denials even when the patient is physically present

These reasons should be considered for inclusion in the normal access control regime, as they represent unmet access control requirements.

### 5.6 Q5: Types of Information Accessed via Actualization/Emergency Access

Table 8 shows the variation in actualization usage across different document categories. The high rate of actualization for the top entry, which includes second opinions, can be attributed to the need for providers to access patient records across ward boundaries. Similarly, the high rate for reports from non-physician specialists, such as physiotherapists and psychologists, reflects the same cross-ward access requirement. The lower rate for nursing-related entries may be due to nurses primarily working with patients admitted to their own wards.

Additionally, image-related lab results have almost twice the actualization rate of tissue and fluid-related lab results, likely because specialists from other wards are often called upon to interpret images.

A more detailed and well-structured category hierarchy could provide a clearer picture of actualization rates. If a decision is made to reduce the use of actualization, such a chart could help identify the best opportunities for reduction.

### 5.7 Q6: Information Required in Access Logs for Misuse Investigation

Exceptional access will always be necessary in healthcare systems to handle emergencies. Therefore, it is crucial to have effective mechanisms to trace any misuse.

The current DocuLive logs do not provide sufficient information to effectively investigate suspected misuse. We had to combine data from two separate logs and the user database to conduct this study, and we believe that more detailed information is still required. The main issue is that the predefined reasons for using actualization often mask the true intent.

For an audit trail to be effective, it should:
- Be accessible through a user-friendly interface for administrators.
- Contain sufficiently detailed information to provide a clear picture of what has happened.

### 6. Discussion

The system under study aligns with the concept of optimistic security [8]. However, this study highlights the challenges in tracing events within such a system. Tracing is essential for ensuring adequate security in systems containing sensitive health information. We believe that healthcare systems require a stricter form of access control, minimizing the use of exceptions.

Our analysis of the audit logs has identified recurring events that should be candidates for inclusion in a more suitable access control model. This would help minimize the use of actualization.

We also emphasize the importance of regulations governing who is assigned permission to use exception mechanisms and ensuring these regulations are followed. It should be easy to obtain an overview of which users or roles have this permission. Minimizing risk involves limiting the user base with the potential to exploit exception mechanisms.

Based on this study, we have not concluded on a definitive set of access control requirements for healthcare systems. However, we have identified some initial requirements that warrant further exploration. Our findings suggest the need for a more dynamic and user-controlled access control solution, with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as the foundation, enhanced with capabilities for handling dynamic events, workflows, and collaboration. Concepts such as role delegation and team-based access control show promise in addressing the identified needs.

### 7. Conclusion and Future Work

While we have identified some initial requirements, more work is needed. We plan to continue our investigation by incorporating data from other systems, including admission and discharge dates, to better understand when actualization is primarily used. Additionally, we aim to observe healthcare personnel's information needs in common tasks, possibly through interviews.
