User: I need to create ZIP archives on demand, using either Python zipfile module or unix command line utilities. 
Resources to be zipped are often > 1GB and not necessarily compression-friendly.
How do I efficiently estimate its creation time / size?
Assistant: I suggest you measure the average time it takes to produce a zip of a certain size. Then you calculate the estimate from that measure. However I think the estimate will be very rough in any case if you don't know how well the data compresses. If the data you want to compress had a very similar "profile" each time you could probably make better predictions.
