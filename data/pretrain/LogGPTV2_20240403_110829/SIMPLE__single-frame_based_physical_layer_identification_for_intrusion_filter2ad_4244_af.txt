networks that is immune to this type of attack. Our detection sys-
tem uses physical layer features within a single frame to fingerprint
the ECUs on a CAN bus. In addition to the reliability and perfectly
distinguishing a legit device from a non-legit one (the average EER
is close to 0 % in in-lab, and 0.8985 % in in-vehicle experiments),
what makes SIMPLE unique is its practicality. It requires a rela-
tively low sampling rate, a single-frame for detection, and incurs
low timing complexity and overhead. It is also able to account for
the variations in the ambient conditions such as temperature and
the supply voltage values. In future, we are interested in how differ-
ent versions of firmware change the voltage output characteristics
of an ECU. Chilenski et al. [6] discuss how the side-channel analysis
of RF emissions relate to the firmware’s execution.

A PRELIMINARIES OF VIDEN AND CIDS
In this section of the appendix, we will re-state the details of CIDS
and Viden.
A.1 CIDS
In order to detect the intrusion and identify the attacker ECU, Cho
et al. proposed Clock-based IDS (CIDS) where the clock skews are
used as the fingerprints of ECUs. This is based on the fact that the
clock in every ECU advances differently. The clock skew is defined
as the difference between the advancing rate of the estimated clock
and the true clock. For example, after t seconds, a clock reports
the elapsed time as t′ seconds. The skew of this clock is then t′−t
.
t
However, since a CAN frame does not contain a timestamp, CIDS
updates the clock skew by evaluating the arrival timestamps of a
batch of n messages, i.e., the moments when these messages arrive
at the receiver.
Specifically, at k-th step (during t[k − 1] to t[k]), n arrival times-
tamps (ai, for n = 1 . . . n) are recorded. The interval between i-th
and i − 1-th arrival timestamps is Ti = ai − ai−1. CIDS calculates
the upper and lower control limits L+[k] and L−[k] as follows:
n
i =1
k
k
(cid:20)
(cid:20)
ai − (a1 + (i − 1)µT [k − 1]),
µT [k] ← 1

Oacc[k] ← Oacc[k − 1] + |O[k]|,

.
If either of the control limits L+[k] or L−[k] exceeds ΓL = 5, CIDS
declares a detection of intrusion. If the adversary wants to defeat
the intrusion detection, it can simply add the following constraints
to Equation 6:
+[k] < ΓL,
−[k] < ΓL .
L
L
With the accumulated clock offset Oacc, the identification error
e[k] and the elapsed time t[k], a linear parameter identification
problem can be formulated as:
Oacc[k] = S[k] · t[k] + e[k],
(15)
where the clock skew S[k] (i.e., the slope) can be learnt using the
Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. The slope S[k] is viewed
as the norm clock behavior that CIDS uses to determine the ex-
pected timing behavior of the legitimate ECU. See Figure 12 for an
illustration of these terms.
A.2 Viden
Since CIDS can deal with only the case when the messages are sent
periodically, Cho et al. proposed the Voltage-based attacker identifi-
