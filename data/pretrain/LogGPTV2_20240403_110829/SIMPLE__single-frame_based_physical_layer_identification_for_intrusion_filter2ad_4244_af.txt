### Proposed Detection System

Our detection system is designed to be immune to hill-climbing-style attacks by using physical layer features within a single frame to fingerprint ECUs on a CAN bus. The system's reliability and ability to distinguish legitimate devices from non-legitimate ones are notable, with an average Equal Error Rate (EER) close to 0% in laboratory settings and 0.8985% in in-vehicle experiments. 

What makes our system, SIMPLE, unique is its practicality:
- **Low Sampling Rate:** Requires a relatively low sampling rate.
- **Single-Frame Detection:** Utilizes a single frame for detection.
- **Low Timing Complexity and Overhead:** Incurs minimal timing complexity and overhead.
- **Adaptability:** Can account for variations in ambient conditions such as temperature and supply voltage values.

Future work will explore how different versions of firmware affect the voltage output characteristics of an ECU. Chilenski et al. [6] discuss the side-channel analysis of RF emissions related to firmware execution.

### Preliminaries of Viden and CIDS

#### A.1 CIDS
Cho et al. proposed Clock-based IDS (CIDS) to detect intrusions and identify attacker ECUs by using clock skews as fingerprints. The clock skew is defined as the difference between the advancing rate of the estimated clock and the true clock. For example, if a clock reports the elapsed time as \( t' \) seconds after \( t \) seconds, the skew is \( \frac{t' - t}{t} \).

Since CAN frames do not contain timestamps, CIDS updates the clock skew by evaluating the arrival timestamps of a batch of \( n \) messages. At the \( k \)-th step (during \( t[k-1] \) to \( t[k] \)), \( n \) arrival timestamps \( a_i \) (for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \)) are recorded. The interval between the \( i \)-th and \( (i-1) \)-th arrival timestamps is \( T_i = a_i - a_{i-1} \).

CIDS calculates the upper and lower control limits \( L^+[k] \) and \( L^-[k] \) as follows:
\[
\mu_T[k] \leftarrow \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i,
\]
\[
O[k] \leftarrow \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=2}^{n} (T_i - \mu_T[k]),
\]
\[
O_{acc}[k] \leftarrow O_{acc}[k-1] + |O[k]|,
\]
\[
e[k] \leftarrow O_{acc}[k] - S[k-1] \cdot t[k],
\]
\[
\mu_e[k] \leftarrow \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} e[i],
\]
\[
\sigma_e^2[k] \leftarrow \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} (e[i] - \mu_e[k])^2,
\]
\[
L^+[k] \leftarrow \max \left( 0, L^+[k-1] + \frac{e[k] - \mu_e[k]}{\sigma_e[k]} - \kappa \right),
\]
\[
L^-[k] \leftarrow \max \left( 0, L^-[k-1] - \frac{e[k] - \mu_e[k]}{\sigma_e[k]} - \kappa \right).
\]

If either \( L^+[k] \) or \( L^-[k] \) exceeds \( \Gamma_L = 5 \), CIDS declares an intrusion. To defeat the intrusion detection, an adversary can add the following constraints:
\[
L^+[k] < \Gamma_L,
\]
\[
L^-[k] < \Gamma_L.
\]

With the accumulated clock offset \( O_{acc} \), the identification error \( e[k] \), and the elapsed time \( t[k] \), a linear parameter identification problem can be formulated as:
\[
O_{acc}[k] = S[k] \cdot t[k] + e[k],
\]
where the clock skew \( S[k] \) (i.e., the slope) can be learned using the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. The slope \( S[k] \) represents the normal clock behavior that CIDS uses to determine the expected timing behavior of the legitimate ECU. See Figure 12 for an illustration of these terms.

#### A.2 Viden
Since CIDS can only handle periodic message transmission, Cho et al. proposed the Voltage-based attacker identification (Viden) to address non-periodic message transmission. [Further details on Viden would follow here.]
