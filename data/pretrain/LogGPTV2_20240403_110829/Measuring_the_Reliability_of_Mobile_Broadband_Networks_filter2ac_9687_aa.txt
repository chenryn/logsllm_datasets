ABSTRACT
Mobile broadband networks play an increasingly important
role in society, and there is a strong need for independent
assessments of their robustness and performance. A promis-
ing source of such information is active end-to-end measure-
ments. It is, however, a challenging task to go from individ-
ual measurements to an assessment of network reliability,
which is a complex notion encompassing many stability and
performance related metrics. This paper presents a frame-
work for measuring the user-experienced reliability in mo-
bile broadband networks. We argue that reliability must be
assessed at several levels, from the availability of the net-
work connection to the stability of application performance.
Based on the proposed framework, we conduct a large-scale
measurement study of reliability in 5 mobile broadband net-
works. The study builds on active measurements from hun-
dreds of measurement nodes over a period of 10 months.
The results show that the reliability of mobile broadband
networks is lower than one could hope: more than 20% of
connections from stationary nodes are unavailable more than
10 minutes per day. There is, however, a signiﬁcant poten-
tial for improving robustness if a device can connect simul-
taneously to several networks. We ﬁnd that in most cases,
our devices can achieve 99.999% (”ﬁve nines”) connection
availability by combining two operators. We further show
how both radio conditions and network conﬁguration play
important roles in determining reliability, and how external
measurements can reveal weaknesses and incidents that are
not always captured by the operators’ existing monitoring
tools.

INTRODUCTION
Cellular Mobile Broadband (MBB) networks are arguably
becoming the most important component in the modern
communications infrastructure. The immense popularity of
mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, combined with
the availability of high-capacity 3G and 4G mobile networks,
have radically changed the way we access and use the Inter-
net. Global mobile traﬃc in 2012 was nearly 12 times the
total Internet traﬃc in 2000 [4]. MBB traﬃc is estimated
to keep growing at a compound annual rate of 66% towards
2017. An increasing number of people rely on their MBB
connection as their only network connection, replacing both
a ﬁxed broadband connection and the traditional telephone
line.
The popularity of MBB networks has given them a role
as critical infrastructure. The reliability of MBB networks
is important for the daily routines of people and business,
and network downtime or degradations can potentially im-
pact millions of users and disrupt important services. More
importantly, failures can also aﬀect emergency services and
people’s ability to get help when they need it.
Given the importance of MBB networks, there is a strong
need for a better understanding of their robustness and sta-
bility. Regulators need data in order to make informed pol-
icy decisions and determine where extra eﬀorts are needed
to improve robustness. Today, regulators are often left with
a posteriori incident reports from the operators, and lack a
true understanding of the many smaller events that aﬀect
the reliability of services. Providers of mobile services that
run on top of MBB networks need reliable data on reliabil-
ity in order to predict the performance of their own services.
End users can use such information to compare diﬀerent op-
erators and choose the provider that best ﬁlls their needs.
The ambition of this work is to measure the experienced
reliability in MBB networks, and to compare reliability be-
tween networks. We believe that reliability in MBB net-
works is too complex to be understood only through static
analysis of the components involved, and that the most
promising approach for assessing and predicting the relia-
bility of the oﬀered service is through long-term end-to-end
measurements. We argue that reliability must be character-
45ized at several levels, including the basic connection between
the user equipment and the base station, the stability of the
data plane, and the reliability of application level perfor-
mance. In this work, these aspects of reliability are assessed
through long-term active measurements from a large number
of geographically distributed measurement nodes. By look-
ing at measurements from individual connections, we are
able to identify important diﬀerences between networks and
to characterize the reliability of each network as a whole. In
summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
1. We propose a framework for measuring robustness in
MBB networks. The framework captures aspects of reliabil-
ity on several layers, from a basic registration in the network
to a stable application performance over time. Within this
framework, we deﬁne metrics and measurement experiments
that describe reliability on the connection level, the data
plane level, and the application level.
2. We present the ﬁrst large-scale measurement study of
MBB reliability, from a dedicated measurement infrastruc-
ture. The measurement experiments are performed on Nor-
net Edge (NNE) [15]. NNE is the largest infrastructure of its
kind, with dedicated measurement nodes distributed in over
100 Norwegian municipalities. The data used in this work
is captured from a total of 938 MBB connections from 341
distinct nodes and 5 diﬀerent operators over a period of 10
months. Through long-term monitoring of a large number
of connections, we ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant fraction of connec-
tions (15-38% depending on the operator) lose their network
attachment more than 10 minute per day. We also observe
clear diﬀerences in reliability characteristics between net-
works. While one network experiences frequent but short-
lived connection failures, other networks have a longer time
between failures but a higher overall downtime.
3. By capturing a rich set of metadata that describes the
context of the measurements, this study increases the value
of end-user measurement data. The metadata allows us to
explain measurement results by looking at factors such as
signal quality, radio state, network attachment, connection
mode, etc. In many cases, we are also able to distinguish
between problems in the radio access network and the mobile
core network. We ﬁnd a clear correlation between signal
conditions, connection failures and loss, but we also discover
that many failures can not be explained by signal quality.
We further ﬁnd that the inability to obtain dedicated radio
resources is a common cause of application failures in some
networks.
4. Thanks to the multi-connected nature of NNE measure-
ment nodes, we can directly compare the performance and
reliability of diﬀerent networks at the same location, and
thereby quantify the potential gain in robustness from end-
device multi-homing. We ﬁnd that there is mostly good
diversity in radio conditions between operators, and that
downtime can be reduced signiﬁcantly if multiple networks
can be used in parallel. In fact, most measurement nodes can
achieve 99.999% (”ﬁve nines”) connection availability when
combining two operators.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces our framework for measuring reliability in MBB
networks. Section 3 presents the measurement infrastruc-
ture and data that forms the basis for our analysis. Sections
4 - 6 analyses reliability at the connection-, data- and ap-
plication layers respectively. Section 7 looks at correlations

gain in robustness through multi-homing in light of this.

2. A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING
MOBILE BROADBAND RELIABILITY
Reliability is a complex notion, which relates to several
stability and performance related metrics. Here, we propose
a model where the reliability of a network is measured at
diﬀerent levels, reﬂecting increasing value for the user. A
high level picture of the framework is shown in Fig. 1. The
proposed model is a generic framework for describing the
experienced reliability in MBB networks. In this work, we
select a few relevant metrics at each level, and use these
to characterize reliability of the measured networks. Other
metrics can later be added to give an even more complete
picture.
UMTS basics. Fig. 2 shows the main components of
a UMTS network, divided into the Radio Access Network
(RAN) and the Core Network (CN). Before any data can be
transmitted, the User Equipment (UE), which can be a mo-
dem or a smartphone, must attach itself to the network and
establish a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context towards
Gateway GPRS Service Node (GGSN). The PDP context is
a data structure that contains the IP address and other infor-
mation about the user session. This state is a prerequisite
for any communication between the UE and the Internet.
Once a PDP context is established, the Radio Network Con-
troller (RNC) controls the Radio Resource Control (RRC)
state of a user. Depending on the traﬃc pattern, RNC allo-
cates a shared or dedicated radio channel for a user. If the
user is not sending any data, RRC sets the state to IDLE or
CELL PCH. Otherwise, based on the bit rate, a user can be
assigned a CELL FACH state (shared channel, low bit rate,
low power usage) or a CELL DCH state (dedicated channel,
high bit rate, high power usage). The principles are similar
in networks based on the CDMA2000 architecture.

At the very basic level,
the UE should have a reliable connection to the MBB net-
work. By ”connection” in this context, we mean that there
is an established PDP context in the CN. The stability of
the PDP context depends on both the RAN and the CN;
the PDP context can be broken by loss of coverage, failures
in base stations or transmission, or by failures or capacity
problems in the central components such as SGSN or GGSN.
From the UE side, having a PDP context maps to having
an assigned IP address from the mobile network. In Sec. 4,
we measure reliability at the connection level by looking at
the stability of the IP address assignment as a proxy for the
PDP context. The metrics we look at are how often the
connection is lost, and how long it takes before the node can
successfully re-establish the PDP context. We also analyze
how these metrics are related to underlying characteristics
of the connections, such as signal strength and connection
mode. The selected metric describes the stability of connec-
tions over time.
Data plane reliability. Having an established PDP
context does not necessarily mean that the UE has well-
functioning end-to-end connectivity to the Internet. Inter-
ference, drop in signal quality or congestion in either the
wireless access or elsewhere in the mobile network may dis-
rupt packet forwarding. This can cause periods of excessive
packet loss, or ”gaps” where no data comes through.
In Sec. 5, we measure data plane reliability by looking
at loss patterns in long-lasting continuous probing streams.
We describe loss patterns in each network, and discuss how
loss must be seen in relation with the radio condition of
the MBB connection. We also use packet loss to identify
abnormal events where packet loss is higher than normal for
a signiﬁcant number of connections.
Application layer reliability. Reliability also involves
a notion of stability and predictability in the performance an
application achieves over the MBB network. This stability
depends of course on both the connection level reliability and
the data plane reliability. Application layer performance
varies depending on the speciﬁc application requirements.
Some applications will perform well under a wide range of
network conditions, while others have stronger requirements
on available bandwidth or delay.
In MBB networks, the
experienced network performance depends on the state of
the connection, since radio resources are assigned depending
on the traﬃc load.
It is therefore diﬃcult to predict the
performance of an application based on generic measurement
probes. Instead, application performance should be assessed
through experiments with actual application traﬃc.
In Sec. 6, we report on measurements with two typical
applications: HTTP download using curl and Voice over IP
(VoIP) using SIP/RTP. These applications have been se-
lected because they are popular in MBB networks, and be-
cause they represent two quite diﬀerent application classes
in terms of traﬃc load. We measure the success rate, i.e.,
how often the download or VoIP call can be successfully
completed. We also report on the stability of the achieved
download rate.
