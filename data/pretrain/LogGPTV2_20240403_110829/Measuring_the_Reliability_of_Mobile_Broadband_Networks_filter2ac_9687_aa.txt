## Abstract

Mobile broadband (MBB) networks are increasingly vital to modern society, necessitating independent assessments of their robustness and performance. Active end-to-end measurements offer a promising source of such information, but translating individual measurements into a comprehensive assessment of network reliability is challenging. This paper introduces a framework for measuring user-experienced reliability in MBB networks. We argue that reliability should be evaluated at multiple levels, from network connection availability to application performance stability. Using this framework, we conducted a large-scale measurement study across five MBB networks, leveraging active measurements from hundreds of nodes over ten months. Our results indicate that the reliability of MBB networks is lower than expected, with more than 20% of stationary nodes experiencing unavailability for over 10 minutes daily. However, significant improvements can be achieved by enabling devices to connect to multiple networks simultaneously. We found that combining two operators can achieve 99.999% ("five nines") connection availability. Additionally, we highlight the roles of radio conditions and network configuration in determining reliability, and how external measurements can reveal weaknesses not captured by existing operator tools.

## 1. Introduction

Cellular mobile broadband (MBB) networks are becoming the most critical component of modern communication infrastructure. The widespread use of smartphones and tablets, combined with high-capacity 3G and 4G networks, has transformed how we access and use the Internet. Global mobile traffic in 2012 was nearly 12 times the total Internet traffic in 2000 [4]. MBB traffic is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 66% towards 2017. Many people now rely on MBB as their primary network connection, replacing fixed broadband and traditional telephone lines.

The importance of MBB networks as critical infrastructure means that their reliability is crucial for daily life and business operations. Network downtime or degradation can impact millions of users and disrupt essential services, including emergency services. Therefore, there is a strong need for a better understanding of MBB network robustness and stability. Regulators require data to make informed policy decisions, while service providers and end-users need reliable information to predict and compare network performance.

This work aims to measure the experienced reliability in MBB networks and compare it across different networks. We believe that long-term, end-to-end measurements are the most effective way to assess and predict MBB network reliability. Our framework evaluates reliability at multiple levels, including the basic connection between user equipment and the base station, the stability of the data plane, and the reliability of application performance. Key contributions of this paper include:

1. **Proposed Framework:** We introduce a framework for measuring MBB network robustness, covering aspects of reliability from basic network registration to stable application performance. Within this framework, we define metrics and measurement experiments for connection, data plane, and application levels.
   
2. **Large-Scale Measurement Study:** We present the first large-scale MBB reliability study using a dedicated measurement infrastructure, Nornet Edge (NNE). The study involves 938 MBB connections from 341 distinct nodes and five different operators over ten months. Our findings show that a significant fraction of connections (15-38% depending on the operator) experience unavailability for more than 10 minutes per day. We also observe clear differences in reliability characteristics between networks.

3. **Contextual Metadata:** By capturing rich metadata, we enhance the value of end-user measurement data. This metadata allows us to explain measurement results by considering factors such as signal quality, radio state, and network attachment. We find a correlation between signal conditions and connection failures, but also identify that many failures are not solely due to signal quality. In some networks, the inability to obtain dedicated radio resources is a common cause of application failures.

4. **Multi-Connected Nodes:** The multi-connected nature of NNE measurement nodes enables direct comparison of different networks' performance and reliability at the same location. We find that using multiple networks in parallel can significantly reduce downtime, with most nodes achieving 99.999% ("five nines") connection availability when combining two operators.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces our framework for measuring MBB network reliability. Section 3 describes the measurement infrastructure and data. Sections 4, 5, and 6 analyze reliability at the connection, data, and application layers, respectively. Section 7 discusses correlations between different networks and the potential gains from multi-homing. Section 8 reviews related work, and Section 9 summarizes the lessons learned from this study.

## 2. A Framework for Measuring Mobile Broadband Reliability

Reliability is a multifaceted concept, encompassing several stability and performance metrics. We propose a model where MBB network reliability is measured at different levels, reflecting increasing value for the user. Figure 1 provides an overview of our framework, which is a generic model for describing experienced MBB network reliability. In this work, we select relevant metrics at each level to characterize the measured networks, with the potential to add more metrics for a more comprehensive picture.

### UMTS Basics

Figure 2 illustrates the main components of a UMTS network, divided into the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network (CN). Before any data transmission, the User Equipment (UE), such as a modem or smartphone, must attach to the network and establish a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context towards the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN). The PDP context contains the IP address and other session information, and is essential for communication between the UE and the Internet. Once established, the Radio Network Controller (RNC) manages the Radio Resource Control (RRC) state, allocating shared or dedicated radio channels based on traffic patterns. Similar principles apply in CDMA2000-based networks.

### Connection Level Reliability

At the most basic level, the UE should have a reliable connection to the MBB network, meaning an established PDP context in the CN. The stability of the PDP context depends on both the RAN and CN, and can be disrupted by loss of coverage, base station failures, or issues in central components like SGSN or GGSN. From the UE's perspective, having a PDP context translates to having an assigned IP address from the mobile network. In Section 4, we measure connection-level reliability by examining the stability of IP address assignment as a proxy for the PDP context. We analyze how often the connection is lost and how long it takes to re-establish, and relate these metrics to underlying characteristics such as signal strength and connection mode.

### Data Plane Reliability

Having an established PDP context does not guarantee well-functioning end-to-end connectivity to the Internet. Interference, signal quality drops, or congestion in the wireless access or elsewhere in the mobile network can disrupt packet forwarding, causing excessive packet loss or "gaps" where no data comes through. In Section 5, we measure data plane reliability by analyzing loss patterns in long-lasting continuous probing streams. We describe loss patterns in each network and discuss their relationship with radio conditions. We also use packet loss to identify abnormal events where loss is higher than normal for a significant number of connections.

### Application Layer Reliability

Reliability also encompasses the stability and predictability of application performance over the MBB network. This stability depends on both connection-level and data plane reliability. Application performance varies based on specific requirements, with some applications performing well under a wide range of conditions, while others have stricter bandwidth or delay requirements. In MBB networks, experienced performance depends on the connection state, as radio resources are allocated based on traffic load. Predicting application performance based on generic measurements is difficult; instead, it should be assessed through experiments with actual application traffic.

In Section 6, we report on measurements with two typical applications: HTTP download using curl and Voice over IP (VoIP) using SIP/RTP. These applications were chosen for their popularity and because they represent different traffic classes. We measure the success rate, i.e., how often the download or VoIP call can be successfully completed, and report on the stability of the achieved download rate.

This paper represents an important first step towards measuring and understanding the reliability of MBB networks.
