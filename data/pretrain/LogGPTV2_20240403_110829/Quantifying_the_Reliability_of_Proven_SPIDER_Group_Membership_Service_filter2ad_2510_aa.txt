## Abstract
This paper investigates the reliability of the assumptions underlying the SPIDER group membership service with respect to both transient and permanent faults. By modeling 12,600 possible system configurations, we find that the probability of the SPIDER's Maximum Fault Assumption (MFA) not holding for a one-hour mission ranges from less than \(10^{-11}\) to more than \(10^{-3}\). In most cases, a transient fault tolerance strategy outperforms the previously used permanent fault tolerance strategy for the expected range of transient fault arrival rates in aerospace systems. The reliability of the MFA varies significantly under asymmetric, symmetric, and benign faults. This case study highlights the importance of quantifying the reliability of assumptions for proven properties.

## 1. Introduction
Formal proofs are an attractive method for developing safety-critical network protocols. These protocols, especially those for aerospace or automotive applications, must exhibit fewer than \(10^{-9}\) failures per hour [12]. Exhaustive testing is impractical due to the enormous time required, often on the order of \(10^9\) hours. Additionally, exhaustive testing provides no feedback during the design phase, when changes are easiest to implement. Formally proven protocols guarantee their services if all assumptions hold, but these assumptions may not be valid for all possible fault cases. For safety-critical systems, it is insufficient to argue that the assumptions are "reasonable"; they must be shown to be reliable.

It is crucial to investigate assumption reliability across a wide design space and explore policy trade-offs at the design stage. Current techniques like Failure Mode Effects Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis predict the reliability of specific instantiations but rely on high-precision failure rate data, which may not be available for novel systems. We present a methodology based on Markov modeling to evaluate assumption reliability over a broad range of parameters. Our case study reveals that systems with identical formal proof bases can have vastly different assumption reliabilities depending on the instantiated system parameters. We analyze the SPIDER group membership service developed by NASA Langley Research Center, focusing on three policies for removing faulty nodes and the impact of transient and permanent faults. The results show the value of testing assumptions under expected fault conditions, covering 12,600 parameter combinations.

## 2. SPIDER
The Scalable Processor-Independent Design for Electromagnetic Resilience (SPIDER) is a family of general-purpose fault-tolerant architectures designed at NASA Langley Research Center to support recovery strategies from transient electromagnetic effects [10]. At its core is the Reliable Optical Bus (ROBUS), which processes elements use to transmit data reliably in a fully-connected, broadcast manner. Formal proofs define the ROBUS's fault tolerance capabilities, applicable to any transmission medium. The ROBUS consists of Bus Interface Units (BIUs) and Redundancy Management Units (RMUs), with BIUs connected to Processing Elements (PEs). Asymmetric faults in PEs, BIUs, and RMUs are handled internally by the ROBUS, provided the proof assumptions hold. Figure 1 from Geser and Miner [9] illustrates the SPIDER architecture.

### 2.1. SPIDER Maximum Fault Assumption
SPIDER is designed to tolerate multiple faulty nodes while providing firm guarantees. The Diagnosis protocol classifies nodes as good, benign faulty, symmetric faulty, or asymmetric faulty. The SPIDER protocols make guarantees contingent upon the Maximum Fault Assumption (MFA), which specifies the maximum number and type of faults SPIDER can handle. If the MFA is satisfied, the guarantees hold; otherwise, they may not. The MFA includes:
- **MFA.1:** Number of Good BIUs > (Number of Symmetric BIUs + Number of Asymmetric BIUs)
- **MFA.2:** Number of Good RMUs > (Number of Symmetric RMUs + Number of Asymmetric RMUs)
- **MFA.3:** (Number of Asymmetric BIUs = 0) or (Number of Asymmetric RMUs = 0)

Reliability analysis determines the probability that these conditions will not hold under a given fault model.

### 2.2. SPIDER Guarantees and Policy Choices
SPIDER provides guarantees through the Interactive Consistency (IC) protocol and the Diagnosis protocol. The IC protocol ensures validity and agreement, while the Diagnosis protocol ensures conviction agreement and correctness. SPIDER uses group membership to enable good nodes to ignore faulty nodes, turning asymmetric and symmetric faulty nodes into benign faulty nodes. Conviction policies balance the risk of inadequate redundancy against the risk of too many faulty nodes in the set of eligible voters.

## 3. Conviction Policies
The SPIDER Diagnosis protocol can remove suspected faulty nodes from membership. We define three conviction policies:
- **All Permanent (Treat All Faults as Permanent):** All faulty nodes are convicted, regardless of whether the fault is permanent or transient.
- **All Transient (No Action):** No action is taken, and faulty nodes are never convicted.
- **Perfect:** Only permanently faulty nodes are convicted, and transient faults are ignored.

These policies represent extreme points in the space of possible conviction policies and require only a single error for conviction. The 'All Transient' strategy is straightforward to implement, while the 'All Permanent' and 'Perfect' strategies face challenges in diagnosing the source of faults and distinguishing between transient and permanent faults.

## 4. Modeling Process
We use Markov modeling to evaluate the reliability of the SPIDER MFA. The model includes static parameters and six parameters that vary over bounded ranges. We cover 12,600 combinations of parameters, demonstrating the feasibility of covering a wide design space.

## 5. Fault Model
Our fault model considers both transient and permanent faults. Transient faults persist for a finite duration, while permanent faults have infinite duration or lasting effects. The relationship between transient fault duration and the execution period of the Diagnosis protocol is discussed in Section 5.2.

## 6. Results
Our results show that the reliability of the SPIDER MFA varies significantly under different types of faults. The 'All Transient' strategy generally outperforms the 'All Permanent' strategy for the expected range of transient fault arrival rates in aerospace systems. The assumptions are less reliable overall for asymmetric faults compared to symmetric or benign faults, as asymmetric faults require additional redundancy.

## 7. Related Work
This paper complements work on assumption coverage, illustrating that 'reasonable' assumptions are not always 'reliable' assumptions. We discuss related work in Section 7.

## Conclusion
Quantifying the reliability of assumptions for proven properties is essential for safety-critical systems. Our case study demonstrates the value of testing assumptions under expected fault conditions, covering a wide range of design space. The results highlight the need for careful consideration of fault models and conviction policies in the design of fault-tolerant systems.
