ABSTRACT
QR-code mobile payment becomes increasingly popular, being of-
fered by major banks (e.g., ICBC) and payment service providers
(e.g., PayPal). Unlike mobile payment solutions provided by hard-
ware vendors (e.g., Apple Pay and Samsung Pay), QR code payment
schemes do not rely on any hardware support and can therefore
be easily deployed. However, the security guarantee of the new
scheme is less clear: in the absence of hardware protection, users’
digital wallet can be vulnerable to an OS-level adversary, who could
steal her secret for generating payment tokens.
We nd that the physical features of a phone’s screen can en-
hance the security protection of this QR-code payment, serving as a
second-factor authentication. Due to manufacturing imperfections,
the luminance levels of the pixels on the screen vary across the
screen’s display area, which can be used to uniquely characterize
the screen. This physical ngerprint cannot be stolen even when
the OS is fully compromised, since the adversary cannot observe
the physical features of the screen.
However, screen ngerprinting could also undermine the mo-
bile payer’s privacy, as less trusted merchants could use it to track
customers and infer their purchase history and preferences. In this
paper, we propose a new authentication solution that anonymously
ngerprints mobile screens. The approach, called AnonPrint obfus-
cates a screen, which hides its ngerprint from the merchants. In
the meantime, the payment provider, who shares a secret with the
payer, is able to reconstruct the mask and authenticate the payer
through her obfuscated ngerprint.

1 INTRODUCTION
Major payment service providers, including PayPal, Alipay, WeChat
Pay (Chinese providers with hundreds of millions users) and ICBC
(the largest bank in the world), have started to allow their customers
to generate QR code on their phones using the secret of their digital
wallet to do payment (Section 2), even in the absence of communi-
cation with the services. This kind of payment is extremely popular
now and is carrying transactions worth trillions of US dollar last
year [4]. Such an o-line mobile payment scheme features a design
oriented towards ease to use. A problem here, however, comes from
the limited understanding of its security guarantee: unlike other
payment solutions, like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, the QR-code
payment does not have hardware protection and therefore is vul-
nerable to an attack on the mobile OS. What’s worse, a recent work
discovered that an adversary can sni a QR code from one mobile
device using a malicious app, without breaking the OS, and use it
at another place, causing monetary loss to buyer or merchant [8].
Mobile display identication. Our study shows that this emerg-
ing payment solution can actually be better protected by leveraging
the physical features that characterize the screen of the payer’s
smartphone. More specically, previous works gured out that
each screen has its unique physical features that can be detected
by specialized devices. Specically, its back light that produces lu-
minance, which cannot be made uniform across all pixels on the
screen during the manufacturing process [23]. Such features can
also be picked up by a close-in camera in lower accuracy, as the one
used in a commercial POS scanner, during code scanning1. Iden-
tication of such a ngerprint, however, is nontrivial, due largely
to the presence of the projective distortions resulted from random
scanning angles, which may cause the same screen look dierently
in dierent scans. We developed a new approach that corrects such
distortions by projecting the image of a screen to a xed observing
plane and then reliably extracting the identifying features from the
projection in a highly ecient way (Section 3).
Convenient and reliable screen ngerprinting has signicant
security and privacy implications, particularly for the o-line pay-
ment. The unique physical features of the screen can serve as a
natural means for a second-factor authentication: even when the
user’s secret (e.g., the secret key for generating QR codes) is stolen,
even when her phone has been fully compromised by the adversary,

to shoot the code.

still no one can perform an o-line payment transaction success-
fully without accessing her physical device or synthesizing the
features of her screen, which we found is hard in the absence of
a high-resolution picture of the screen. On the other hand, the
screen ngerprint of the payer’s phone makes her harder to stay
anonymous during her purchases, because the vendor could take
advantage of the opportunity when scanning the QR code displayed
on her phone to capture the ngerprint from the screen. This in-
formation, once exposed to a third party, such as an advertising
(ad) company, can be used to link the same device’s transactions
across dierent stores, enabling the party to track the customer’s
purchase activities.
Anonymous screen ngerprinting. An intriguing challenge
here is how to enable service provider to utilize the screen to en-
hance security protection while preserve the privacy at the same
time. This is by no means trivial: again, in the payment scenario,
we need to hide the physical features of one’s display to the POS
scanner, which is under the control of the vendor, but somehow
communicate them to the payment service provider in a reliable
way; also the operating system is considered to be untrusted and
any protection working here needs to be built on top of the screen’s
physical properties. In our research, we found that all these aims
can actually be achieved, through a carefully designed technique
called AnonPrint.
AnonPrint is designed to use randomly generated visual one-
time masks (a pixel pattern with dots set to various brightness
levels) to obfuscate the distinguishable features of a user’s screen.
Such a mask is designed to hide the physical properties of a screen,
and meant to be indistinguishable from a real ngerprint. In the
meantime, for the party that knows the mask, such as the payment
service provider, it can still verify whether the features collected
from the protected screen are indeed related to the authorized
device. More specically, our approach randomly creates a smooth
textured pattern for each transaction (which is also known to the
provider), and displays such a pattern as the background of QR code
to disarrange the brightness of a screen, in line with its real-world
physical properties: neighboring dots are correlated and the levels
of brightness change smoothly. Leveraging our feature extraction
technique, such an obfuscated feature can still be reliably captured
by the scanner and delivered to the provider. The provider can then
re-obfuscate the ngerprint of the authorized device with the same
mask, and run a correlation test on both the synthesized ngerprint
and the one reported (by the vendor) to determine whether it comes
from the authorized party.
We implemented this technique and evaluated it over up to 100
smartphones. Our experiment results show that these devices can
be reliably dierentiated from each other with or without random
masks. Also, once the masks were applied, we found that the cor-
relations between the ngerprints extracted from the same device
(under dierent masks) dropped to the level of those between two
dierent devices, indicating that the attempt to establish a link
between dierent payment transactions, as mentioned earlier, will
fail.
Contributions. The contributions of the paper are outlined as
follows:
• New discovery. We found that screen luminance unevenness
can be used to uniquely ngerprint a device and developed
a new technique that reliably and eciently extracts such
features from each screen.
• New technique. We analyzed the security and privacy im-
plications of the screen ngerprinting, under the settings
of o-line mobile payment, and highlight the privacy risk
of correlating dierent payment transactions and the secu-
rity opportunity of using the features as a reliable means
for a second factor authentication. Further, we developed
an innovative technique to anonymously recover the nger-
print from each device, protecting the user from the curious
vendor, as well as the OS-level adversary.
• Implementation and evaluation. We implemented our design
and evaluated it over a large number of real-world smart-
phones. Our experiment results show that the new technique
can eectively protect the user from both untrusted vendors
and the untrusted OS during an o-line payment.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce the background about the uneven
brightness property of screen and o-line QR payment, and then
present the adversary model of our research.
2.1 Screen
Brightness unevenness. Key to our screen ngerprinting tech-
nique is the observation that there are subtle dierences in the max-
imum luminance of the pixels at dierent locations of the screen.
Taking LCD screens as an example (see Figure 1), the light emitted
by the back light unit has to come across many layers to get adjusted
and nally perceived by human. Due to the imperfection in the
screen manufacturing, which could bring defects to its components,
the light from the back light unit can be spread unevenly over the
screen, making the border darker than the center and causing the
Mura eect. The transparency of the polarizer varies at dierent
parts of the screen, and therefore the default angle for bending the
polarized lights can be varied as well when no voltage is applied.
Although on a qualied product, all such subtle defects are barely
observable to human eyes, they can however be reliably identied
by a camera, as observed in our study.

panels that have no back-end light source, and instead, they are
built upon organic light emitting diode, with every pixel emitting
lights of dierent strengthes. Those panels also have luminance
unevenness, which can be picked up by the same technique we
developed for analyzing screens, as shown by our evaluations.
2.2 O-line QR Payment
Figure 2: A POS supporting QR code payment.
QR-code payment is gaining popularity in recent years mainly
because of its ease of use. When a buyer checks out her purchases,
she only needs to run a wallet app and clicks on its “pay” button to
show a one-time QR code on the screen , and presents the screen
close to the camera of the vendor’s POS machine for scanning.
After the vendor enters the right amount the buyer needs to pay,
the scan starts and the POS machine will notify both parties if
the transaction is approved by the payment service provider (see
Figure 2 for POS and [2] for more details).
Payment transaction. To use the payment scheme, the payer
needs to set up an account with the payment provider (e.g., Alipay),
install its wallet app and log in her account through the app when
she is ready to pay. The app contains a piece of secret downloaded
from the provider for generating one-time tokens.
When the payer initiates a payment transaction (by pressing the
payment button of the wallet app), the app proceeds as illustrated
in Figure 3 to complete the transaction. Specically, it uses the
current time, the user ID and the stored secret as inputs to generate
a random token (usually using HMAC), which is then encoded into
a QR code to be shown on the payer’s screen. After being scanned
into the POS system, the token is extracted from the scanned image,
together with other transaction information like the total amount
and currency type, and sent to the payment provider.
The provider, upon receiving the token and transaction informa-
tion, recovers from the token the user ID and uses the information
to retrieve the stored secret of the payer, in order to verify the token.
When the token is valid and still fresh (within a given time frame),
the provider checks whether payer’s fund is sucient, and noties
the vendor of the acceptance of the payment.
Threat of OS-level and app-level attack. Compared with other
mobile payment schemes, however, the QR code payment is limited
