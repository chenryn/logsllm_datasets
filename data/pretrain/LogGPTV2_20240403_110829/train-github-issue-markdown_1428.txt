This is a proposition to deprecate `logistic_regression_path` and make it
private.
Context: #11476 (comment)
Making it private would make it much easier to refactor the code in
`LogisticRegression` and especially in `LogisticRegerssionCV`, where a lot of
case-by-case logic has to be implemented due to non-homogeneous array shapes.
The deprecation should not affect users. Quoting a mail from @amueller who has
looked for occurences of the use of `logistic_regression_path` on GitHub
repositories:
> Can confirm it's not used anywhere. I get 12 hits in the 46081 files using
