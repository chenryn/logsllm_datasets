Abstract 
The continuous decrease in CMOS technology feature 
size increases the susceptibility of such circuits to single 
event  upsets  (SEU)  caused  by  the  impact  of  particle 
strikes  on  system  flip  flops.  This  paper  presents  a  novel 
SEU-tolerant  latch  where  redundant  feedback  lines  are 
used to mask the effects of SEUs. The power dissipation, 
area, reliability, and propagation delay of the presented 
SEU-tolerant  latch  are  analyzed  by  SPICE  simulations. 
The results show that this latch consumes about 50% less 
power  and  occupies  42%  less  area  than  a  TMR-latch. 
However, the reliability and the propagation delay of the 
proposed  latch  are  still  the  same  as  the  TMR-latch.the 
reliability  of  the  proposed  latch  is  also  compared  with 
other SEU-tolerant latches. 
1. Introduction 
When  a  high  energy  neutron  or  an  alpha  particle 
strikes  a  sensitive  region  in  a  semiconductor  device,  a 
single event upset (SEU) occurs that can alter the state of 
the  system  resulting  in  a  soft  error.  Traditionally,  single 
event  upsets  were  only  the  main  concern  for  space 
applications [17].  Currently,  smaller  feature  size,  lower 
voltage levels and higher frequencies of deep sub-micron 
integrated  circuits,  make  the  circuits  susceptible  to  the 
SEUs even at the ground level  [2]  [3]  [4]. 
Since the chip and the packaging materials themselves 
emit alpha particles, packaging cannot be effectively used 
to  shield  circuits  against  SEUs   [14].  In  addition,  SEUs 
can also be caused by neutrons which can easily penetrate 
through packages [13]. These two above facts address the 
importance of incorporating SEU-tolerance techniques to 
increase the reliability requirements of digital circuits. 
SEU-tolerant techniques can be applied to three levels 
 [14]   [15]:  1)  Device  level:  an  example  of  device  level 
techniques  is  the  extra  doping  layer   [5]  which  can  be 
applied  in  fabrication  process  to  suppress  the  effects  of 
particle strikes and to reduce the probability of SEUs. 2) 
System  level:  techniques  such  as  error  detection  and 
correction codes  [12], and control flow checking [7] use 
information,  hardware  or  time  redundancy    at  system 
level  to  reduce  the  SEU  effects.  3)  Circuit  level:  here, 
robust circuit design techniques are employed to mitigate 
or eliminate the sensitivity of the circuit to SEUs. These 
techniques  are  based  on 
level 
redundancies to provide SEU-tolerance   [8]  [9]  [10]  [11] 
 [15]  [16]  [27]  [28]. 
the  use  of  circuit 
One  effective  way  to  overcome  the  SEU  effects  at 
circuit  level  is  to  triplicate  each  latch  of  the  system  i.e. 
TMR-latch.  Although  the  TMR-latch  is  highly  reliable 
and  widely  used  latch   [21]   [22]   [23]   [24]   [25],  but  it 
suffers  from  high  area  overhead  and  power  dissipation 
which are not acceptable for applications where cost and 
power consumption are the primary concerns. To reduce 
the  cost  and  the  power  consumption,  some  techniques 
such  as   [9]   [15]   [16]   [27]   [28],  employ  redundant 
components inside the latch. Unlike the TMR-latch, these 
latches  cannot  tolerate  all  the  SEUs  and  they  can  only 
mitigate  the  effects  of  relatively  low  energy  particles. 
This  means  that  these  techniques  cannot  be  used  in 
applications where high reliability is the main concern. 
The contributions of this paper are twofold: 
i. A circuit level technique for protecting latches against 
SEUs  is  proposed.  This  latch  provides  the  same 
reliability as a TMR-latch and occupies 42% less area 
and  consumes  about  50%  less  power  than  the  TMR-
latch. In the proposed technique, a redundant feedback 
line is added to the latch and also a filtering circuit is 
utilized 
the  redundant  and  original 
feedback lines in a way that the occurrence of an SEU 
in  a  line  has  no  effect  on  the  other  line.  In  fact,  the 
filtering  circuit  prevents  the  propagation  of  SEU 
effects  through  the  latch  output  regardless  of  the 
amount of the particle energy (section 3). 
to  combine 
ii. Detailed  SPICE-based  fault  injection  experiments 
have  been  performed  for  analyzing  the  SEU-tolerant 
as well as SEU-hardened latches presented in [9]  [15] 
 [16]  [27]  [28]. This analysis shows that: 
a. In most of the previous SEU-tolerant latches, except 
for  the  TMR-latch,  there  are  still  some  parts  in  a 
latch which are not protected and are very vulnerable 
to SEUs (section 3).  
b. Most  of  the  previous  SEU-tolerant  latches,  except 
for the TMR-latch, cannot tolerate the SEUs caused 
by relatively high energy particles (section 3).  
The  analysis  shows  that  the  proposed  SEU-tolerant 
latch  has  no  one  of  the  two  above  limitations.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents an SEU-tolerant latch. In section 3, the reliability 
of the previous latches is investigated and compared with 
the  proposed  latch.  The  Propagation  delay  and  power 
analysis are presented for the proposed latch in section 4. 
Finally section 5 concludes the paper.  
2. The Proposed SEU-Tolerant Latch 
A conventional latch (Figure 1.b) employs a feedback 
path which includes an inverter and a transmission gate to 
hold  the  data  during  the  keeping  phase.  Suppose  that  a 
transient  voltage  pulse  due  to  a  SEU  occurs  in  the 
feedback path (nodes N1 or N2 in Figure 1.b) during the 
keeping  phase.  This  may  change  the  output  of  the  latch 
depending on the amount of deposited charge. 
In  this  paper,  a  redundant  feedback  along  with  a 
filtering  circuit  is  used  to  prevent  the  SEU  effect 
propagation  through  the  output.    The  filtering  circuit 
called  C-element  is  a  modified  inverter  and  is  shown  in 
Figure 1.a  [29]. The C-element is a state holding element, 
and it has the basic property that inverts its inputs only if 
both of its inputs are of identical logic value. If the two 
inputs  of  this  circuit  have  different  values,  the  previous 
output value will be retained. Figure 1.c shows the output 
of the C-element for some sample input values. As it can 
be seen, during the time interval (t0, t1) since the inputs A 
and B have the same values equal to "1", the output value 
becomes "0" i.e., the C-element acts as an inverter. When 
the  inputs  A  and  B  have  different  values  in  the  time 
interval (t1, t2), the C-element retains its output and enters 
to its filtering mode. It should be considered that the time 
interval  (t1,  t2)  must  be  relatively  short  because  in  this 
situation  the  output  node  is  connected  neither  to  the 
supply source nor to the ground and the stray capacitance 
may be discharged by the saturated current. 
latch.  Three  C-elements  are  used 
Figure  2  shows  the  block  diagram  of  the  proposed 
SEU-tolerant 
to 
construct the redundant feedback. The C-elements 1 and 2 
are used to prevent the propagation of a transient occurred 
in  node  N1  or  N2  to  the  output  and  the  C-element  3 
protects  the  output  from  the  transient  occurred  in  nodes 
N3 or N4. Suppose that the initial values of nodes N1 and 
N2  are  "1",  and  consequently  nodes  N3  and  N4  will  be 
"0". In this case, if a transient occurs in the node N1, the 
value  of  this  node  will  be  changed  to  "0"  and  will  be 
propagated to both C-elements 1 and 2. Since the node N2 
is not affected by the transient, the C-elements 1 and 2 fall 
into their filtering mode and retain their previous values, 
"0" i.e., the values of nodes N3 and N4 are not affected by 
the transient. Therefore the output will not be erroneous. 
As the values of nodes N3 and N4 are not affected by the 
transient, the value of node N1 or N2 will be corrected by 
the node N3 or N4 through the feedback line. 
The  C-element  3  is  responsible  for  preventing  the 
propagation  of  the  transient  occurred  in  the  node  N3  or 
N4. Again suppose that the initial values of nodes N1 and 
N2 are "1". If the transient occurs in the node N3 or N4, 
the  two  inputs  of  the  C-element  3  take  different  values. 
This  deference  makes  the  C-element  3  enters  to  its 
filtering  mode  so  that  the  transient  is  not  propagated 
toward the output. Since a change in value of the node N3 
or N4 appears in the node N1 or N2, the C-elements 1 and 
2 also act as a filtering circuit. Consequently, all of the C-
elements are in the filtering mode (keeping their previous 
values)  until  the  next  level  of  the  clock  signal  in  which 
the new data must be written. As it was mentioned earlier 
in this situation the output node is not connected to any 
supply source and becomes float. But it should be noted 
that the SEU can only cause a soft error in a latch in the 
keeping phase so that this condition lasts less than half a 
cycle and does not affect the functionality of the proposed 
latch.

3. Comparative Analysis 
As  the  main  focus  of  this  paper  is  on  SEU-tolerant 
latch design in circuit level, a TMR-latch along with some 
other SEU-tolerant latches proposed in  [9] [15]  [16]  [27] 
 [28] are chosen and analyzed by the use of HSPICE tool 
to compare with the proposed latch in terms of reliability. 
3.1. SEU-Injection Method 
latch, 
To  investigate  the  SEU-tolerance  capability  of  the 
the  SPICE  based  SEU-injection 
proposed 
experiments were used. The simulations were carried out 
for  the  proposed  and  previously  presented  latches  using 
CMOS  predictive  transistor  models  presented  in   [8]. 
SEUs were injected using the current source, which  can 
accurately  represent  the  electrical  impact  of  a  particle 
strike. Similar approaches have been used in prior works 
 [13]  [17]  [20]. Figure 3 shows the injected current caused 
by a particle strike using the following model  [13]:

3.2. Reliability Analysis of the Previous Work 
As  shown  in  Figure  4,  a  TMR-latch  includes  three 
identical  latches  with  a  voting  circuit.  Due  to  a  large 
amount  of  redundancy  used  in  TMR-latch,  its  area 
overhead  and  power  dissipation  are  rather  high.  In 
contrast, since the SEU can affect only one of the latches 
at a time, the TMR-latch can tolerate the soft error caused 
by the SEU. Therefore this technique is extremely robust 
against  soft  errors  and  even  high  energetic  SEUs  are 
tolerated.
