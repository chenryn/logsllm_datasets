Click Fraud - Definition
From Wikipedia -
“When a person, script or computer program 
imitates a legitimate user to generate a “charge 
per click” of an advertised product”
Is Click Fraud relatively unknown?  Poll
Google Adsense Model
• www.google.com/adsense
• Click fraud risk
Botnets
• From Wikipedia-
“a collection of compromised computers 
(“zombies”) running… under a common 
command-and-control infrastructure”

Dawkins Meme Theory
• Dawkins coined the term “meme” in 1976
• An idea like “I want a tattoo”
• Wikipedia definition -
“a unit of cultural information that propagates from 
one mind to another as a theoretical unit of 
cultural evolution”
Ideosphere
• The sum of all memes in circulation
• The “Global Human Consciousness”
• The Internet has a subset of the Ideosphere
Empirical Meme Theory (Me!)
• Original Meme Theory
• Keywords As Proxy For A Meme
• Electron Flow  ( E = I x R )  (Networks)
• S-Curve
• Meme Miner ( Dejanews.com )
• Google Trends tool
• Blogpulse.com
Example: Delphi
Example: Easter Bunny
Example: Sex & Terrorism
Meme Assumptions
• Memes propagate as an S-Curve
• Memes propagate to most sites but at 
different amplitudes and latencies

• Single source
• Dejanews.com indexing revised by Google
• Older technology losing favor
Expanded Mining Model
First tested on “MySpace” meme…
MySpace Meme (Dejanews)
MySpace Meme (Alexa)
MySpace Meme (Google)
The New Model Worked…
For the “MySpace” meme, so I tested it against 
another case, a new site with a high growth rate…
“IAmFacingForeclosure.com” (IAFF.com)
But the results were different…
IAFF Meme (Alexa)
IAFF Meme  (Dejanews)
IAFF Meme (Google)
Meme Seepage Theory
Remember our Meme assumptions?  Memes propagate as an 
S-curve and across most sites but with varying amplitudes and 
latencies.
If traffic increases to a primary site, then traffic to linked sites 
should increase proportionally (more or less)
If traffic increases to a primary site, then traffic to reference 
sites like Google should increase proportionally… and other 
sites in the top 10 result list should experience a lesser but 
measurable increase in traffic…
Primary Meme Seepage
So I Experimented..
I posted a link directly to IAFF.com, to tap off a 
slice of IAFF.com’s traffic via meme seepage.  
Theoretically, a doubling of IAFF traffic should 
produce an equal ratio of redirected traffic to my 
own site, RealMeme.com
But the results were wrong again…
And I Experimented Again…
Alexa showed IAFF.com with a 25% increase in 
traffic but my site experienced no concurrent 
increase.   
I was surprised and I posted the results to 
IAFF.com.
And a few days later, I did experience an 
anomalous increase in traffic but it didn’t match 
IAFF.com’s Alexa traffic delta.  Here’s what hit 
my site…
Botnet Proof
• Too many simultaneous operating systems per IP. 
• The traffic is too dense and changeover too abrupt. 
• Too many 2-page hits (my traffic is 90% 1-page)
• The page hits don't follow a human click flow. 
• All hits are bookmarks, no blog entry points
• Most bookmarks are older
The following page hits are logs from my website.  
It’s clear that they were artifically produced…
Botnet Logs (Same IP)
Botnet Logs (Density)
Botnet Logs (Pages)
Botnet Logs (Entry Points)
Botnet Epiphany
Okay, I’m not the smartest guy in the world 
but I eventually figured out that this new traffic 
was generated by bots.
But why?
So I tried another experiment…
Secondary Seepage Failure
I have a confession. My website was designed 
specifically for Google rankings and it’s been 
surprisingly successful (my Defcon 16 presentation! 
Ho!)  So I decided…
to induce a secondary seepage from IAFF.com to my 
site via Google…
Binding
I bound my site to IAFF.com by posting an 
IAFF.com analysis which was indexed by 
Google. At one point, I was  the #7 Google result 
for 
“IAmFacingForeclosure.com”
So now I’m getting a slice of traffic directly from 
IAFF.com AND from Google’s search results for 
IAFF.com
Binding Results
Once again, I saw major anomalies between 
IAFF.com’s claimed traffic and the induced 
seepage to my site during “a major television 
event”.
Can I prove fraud?  No.
But I don’t need to. I’m not Google or a Google 
advertiser.
My Theory
The botnets are mimicking meme seepage by generating 
traffic to linked secondary sites.  
At first, I couldn’t figure out why.  But as I worked out 
a methodology to expose botnet manipulation, I realized 
that LACK OF SEEPAGE is a major red flag.  After all, 
that’s how I found these anomalies to begin with.

Humans versus Bots
Needed: a pervasive, immutable quality which is 
detectable in humans but which bots can never 
duplicate.
What is it?
Humans actually buy advertised products.
Conclusion
• Click fraud is more pervasive than reported
• It can be detected with memetic analysis…
• Botnets are a serious problem
• It will eventually become almost impossible to 
detect sophisticated bots.
• What will Google do?
