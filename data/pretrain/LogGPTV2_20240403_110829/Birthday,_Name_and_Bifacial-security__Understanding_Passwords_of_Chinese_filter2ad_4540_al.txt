Note that, among all Chinese datasets, Duowan has
the least inversion number (i.e., 9 in dark gray) with the
dataset “All Chinese PWs”. This indicates that Duowan
passwords are likely to best represent general Chinese
web passwords, and thus Duowan will be selected as the
training set for attacking other Chinese datasets (see Sec
5). For a similar reason, Rockyou will be selected as the
training set when attacking English passwords.
Length distribution. Fig. 2 depicts the length distri-
butions of passwords.
Irrespective of the web service,
language and culture differences, the most common pass-
word lengths of every dataset are between 6 and 10,
among which length-6 and 8 take the lead. Merely
passwords with lengths of 6 to 10 can account for more
than 75% of every entire dataset, and this value will rise
to 90% if we consider passwords with lengths of 5 to
12. Very few users prefer passwords longer than 15
characters. Notably, people seem to prefer even lengths
