bounded by the droplet request rate from a particular en-
try server. The latency can be decreases signiﬁcantly by
adding a peer to peer communications between all the
participants. Such peer to peer network allows the feed
data transferred between participants hence decrease the
load of the CoverUp and in particular the mix server. Ef-
fectively CoverUp will behave like a bit torrent network
enhancing the bandwidth multiple fold.
Mix-server as a full HTTP proxy. CoverUp can be
easily extended to make the mix server acts like a full
HTTP proxy server. Such modiﬁcation will allow a
voluntary participants to browse through arbitrary web
pages. This can be an immediate extension of CoverUp.
Custom browser. Our evaluation of the timing leakage
of CoverUp (Section 7) shows that the browser exten-
sion, used for the bi-directional channel, has some tim-
ing leakages. After many careful observations and ex-
periments, we conjecture that the timing leakages arises
from the browser’s internal scheduler. The extension op-
erates through several layers of heavy abstractions which
makes it non trivial to develop extensions which are such
timing sensitive in nature. We think that a set modiﬁca-
tions in the browser code will solve such problem where
all the modiﬁcations can be implemented on native code
rather than high level abstraction (such as the JavaScript
based API). Such modiﬁcation is nontrivial and requires
a high amount of engineering effort, making it out of
scope for our current research. But such modiﬁcation
can be an immediate followup of this work and would be
a major contribution towards privacy preserving brows-
ing applications.

We discussed how “forced” participation can improve the
privacy of anonymous communication network (ACNs).
By adding involuntary participants to the anonymity set,
we achieve not only an increased anonymity set but also
a plausible deniability: an attacker cannot tell whether an
observed communication stream originates from a volun-
tary or an involuntary participant. We developed a sys-

13 Preliminaries
In this section we describe existing tools and techniques
that have been used in our proposed system CoverUp.

13.1 Fountain Code
Fountain codes [49, 56] are a class of forward error cor-
rection (FEC) codes with the following properties
• Arbitrary sequence of encoding symbols can be
generated form a given set of source symbols i.e.,
input data.
• Original source symbols can be recovered from any
subset of encoding symbols with size more than a
threshold value T .
• Encoding symbols can be delivered regardless of
speciﬁc order.
• Fountain codes does not show ﬁxed code rate.
In this paper, we have used a bit-wise XOR (⊕) based
fountain code with error detection mechanism.
In a simple analogy, one can consider an empty glass
for water. A fountain emits the input data encoded in a
large amount of droplets in a steady stream. Anyone can
collect them in a glass alternately and if one thinks the
glass is ﬁlled enough, one may try to assemble the data
from the water (data stored in the glass). If the amount
of droplets is insufﬁcient to reassemble the data, one has
to wait longer to collect more droplets and retries later.
Our speciﬁc fountain code implementation is not opti-
mal. There exists efﬁcient fountain codes such as Raptor
[54] in the literature but most of them are protected by
intellectual property rights.
13.2 All-or-nothing transformation
All-or-nothing transformation is an encryption mode in
which the data only can be decrypted if all the encrypted
data is known. More precisely: “An AONT is an un-
keyed, invertible, randomized transformation, with the
property that it is hard to invert unless all of the output is
known.”[27].
We modiﬁed the all-or-nothing scheme proposed by
Rivest [53] which encrypts all data with a symmetric key
cryptography algorithm (in our implementation, we use
AES-128 [33]) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode
and appends a new block in which the encryption key is
XOR’ed (⊕) with the 128 bit truncated SHA-256 hashes
of all the encrypted blocks. This guarantees that one
needs all encrypted data (or at least its hash) to extract
the decryption key from last block.
