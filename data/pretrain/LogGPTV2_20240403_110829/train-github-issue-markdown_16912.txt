### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### Current Behavior
I have `prettier-plugin-packagejson` installed (which has `sort-package-
json@1.51.0` as a dependency)
And trying to run `npx PI:EMAIL` because I want to use version
1.48, before this tragic PR was merged
But npx picks up version 1.51.0 which is in my local deps, and in PATH. But
it's the wrong version.
### Expected Behavior
npx should make sure that it's running version `1.48`, as requested.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. Make sure `sort-package-json` is not installed globally (`npm rm sort-package-json`)
  2. Make sure it's not in PATH: `which sort-package-json` should not return anything
  3. Do `npm init`
  4. Add these two scripts in `package.json`: 
        "z": "should be last",
    "a": "should be first"
  5. Do `npm i prettier-plugin-packagejson`
  6. Run `npx PI:EMAIL`
  7. Observe scripts still not sorted, because 1.51 was used (`cat package.json`, see "z" will be still before "a")
Optional:
  8. Remove local deps: `rm -rf ./node_modules/`
  9. Run `npx PI:EMAIL` again
  10. Observe scripts are now sorted because 1.48 was used (`cat package.json`, see "a" will be before "z")
### Environment
  * OS: Ubuntu 20 (WSL)
