 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
I think its a bug not sure
**What is the current behavior?**  
I am using a function which creates a component which lazy loads the
underlying component using React.lazy. My idea for creating this method was to
prevent code duplication. I have a child component which has some text, and
its wrapped by a layout. I am trying to dynamically load the child component
using suspense and react lazy
    import React, { lazy, Suspense } from "react";
    import Layout from "./components/layout";
    function generateLazy(importCompnent) {
      const Content = lazy(importCompnent());
      return props => (
          Loading...}>
      );
    }
    // Usage in App.js
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import createLazy from "./createLazy";
    import "./styles.css";
    const LazyComponent = createLazy(() => import("./components/text"));
    function App() {
      return (
      );
    }
When i do the above i get an error saying **ctor is not a function**

It's likely i'm doing something wrong. I've also attached a working demo below
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce  
Working demo https://codesandbox.io/s/nn5ozqpz5j
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Ideally this should lazy load the component, i.e the suspense fallback prop,
should say loading first and then the text should be loaded in the parent
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
OS: OSX El capitan 10.11.16  
React Version: 16.8.6
