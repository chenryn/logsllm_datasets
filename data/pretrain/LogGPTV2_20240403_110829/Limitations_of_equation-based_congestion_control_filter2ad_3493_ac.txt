ﬁnding in [5]. Even if they all have the same packet loss rates,
we observe their loss event rates to be quite different. Fig. 2
shows the loss event rates of each ﬂow and Fig. 3 shows the
sending rates of TCP, TFRC, and CBR in each run. The sending
rate of CBR ﬂuctuates a little because of the randomized arrival
process. Evidently, the lower the sending rate of a CBR ﬂow is,
the larger its loss event rate is, which conﬁrms Corollary 4.2 .
In all experiments, the CBR ﬂows with smaller sending rates
than TCP always have a higher loss event rate than TCP—con-

we observe the effects of R1, R4, and R5 altogether to cause the loss event rate

sistent with Corollary 4.1. The ﬂows with a signiﬁcantly higher
sending rate than TCP (in particular, 1-Mbps and 500-Kbps
CBR ﬂows) have a lower loss event rate than TCP. Note that
Theorem 4.1 requires, in order for TFRC (and CBR) to see a
lower loss event rate than TCP, the maximum TCP congestion
to be always less
window size during an observation period
than the average number of packets per RTT by a TFRC con-
nection. Because of this restriction, unless CBR ﬂows have a
signiﬁcantly higher sending rate than TCP, this behavior is not
observed. On the other hand, the 195-Kbps CBR ﬂow gets ap-
proximately the same loss event rate as TCP whose sending
rate varies from 200 to 30 Kbps. This phenomenon occurs most
likely because the effect of R1 cancels out the effect of R5
(if there is any), and these forces somehow maintain a balance
around 195 Kbps. We do not know why this particular sending
rate creates such a balance. Below we analyze the experiment
data further to relate the CBR result to the loss event rate differ-
ence between TCP and TFRC.
In Fig. 2, TFRC shows a consistently higher loss event rate,
and the difference is increasing as the network load increases.
By examining only Fig. 2, it is hard to discern whether the lower
sending rates of TFRC than TCP (as shown in Fig. 3) contribute
to causing the lower loss event rates for TFRC because the ef-
fects of R1 and R4 are mixed. To gather more evidence, we
conduct the following two measurements. (M1) We measure the
loss event rates of CBR ﬂows whose average sending rates are

event rate difference, and the effect of different responsiveness to congestion on
the loss event rate difference. We can see the effects of R1 and R4. It also shows

that between the loss event rate difference and the throughput difference.
approximately the same as TCP (in Fig. 3, those CBR ﬂows in-
tersect with TCP) and also measure the loss event rates of TCP
and TFRC (here note that while CBR and TCP have approx-
imately the same sending rate, TFRC does not have the same
rate). (M2) We measure the loss event rates of CBR ﬂows whose
average sending rates are approximately the same as TFRC (in
Fig. 3, those CBR ﬂows intersect with TFRC). The top of Fig. 4
shows the result in which each data point is obtained from an
average from 30 runs; error bars correspond to one standard de-
viation. For instance, in Fig. 3, under the run with 35 long-lived
background TCP ﬂows, the sending rates of TCP and the CBR
ﬂow (with 165-Kbps rate) are approximately the same. We run
this same environment (with different random seeds) for 30
of 0.038 and the data
times. These runs have an average
point for 0.038 in the top of Fig. 4 is obtained from the average
values from these 30 runs.
1) Effect of Responsiveness: Let us analyze the effect of R1
from the results of M1 and M2. The top of Fig. 4 shows the loss
event difference ratios of CBR and TCP from M1, of CBR and
TFRC from M2. In the ﬁgure, we ﬁnd that the CBR ﬂows in M1
experience a higher loss event rate than TCP, and the CBR ﬂows
in M2 get a higher loss event rate than TFRC. Note that CBR is
less responsive to congestion than TCP and TFRC. These loss
event rate differences are likely caused by R1 because there is
little effect of differing sending rates (due to the ways M1 and
M2 are set up) and the other factors (R2 and R3) are effectively
eliminated in the experiment. We note that the loss event rate
difference ratio of CBR and TCP is much larger than that of
CBR and TFRC. This implies that the degree of responsiveness
signiﬁcantly affects the amount of loss event rate difference be-
cause TFRC is less responsive than TCP. That is, the more re-
sponsive a ﬂow is, the higher loss rate it gets, which conﬁrms
the results from [3] and [24].
2) Effect of Different Sending Rates: If there is no effect of
R4 and R5, then irrespective of sending rates, the loss event
rates of CBR, TCP, and TFRC must be in the following order:
CBR TFRC TCP. However, we ﬁnd in Fig. 4 that the loss
858

thus would have a higher loss event rate than TCP. Yet, in our
measurement, they have a lower loss event rate than TCP (es-
pecially, the ﬂow with scale factor 4 under a less than 8% loss
event rate). This strongly suggests that the sending rate differ-
ence is one of the main causes that TFRC can have a lower loss
event rate than TCP in the experiment.
In the following sections, we study why TCP and TFRC can
have different sending rates, from the ﬁrst place, although run-
ning in the same environment, and provide empirical evidence
suggesting that the loss event difference ampliﬁes the initial
sending rate differences.
V. IMPACT OF TCP-FRIENDLY EQUATION
In Section IV, we showed some theoretical and empirical ev-
idence that the difference in average sending rates causes TFRC
and TCP to experience different loss event rates. A natural ques-
tion is why TCP and TFRC would have different sending rates
from the ﬁrst place. [24] provides one answer for the question;
makes TFRC conser-

tiveness of TFRC with respect to the target throughput deﬁnes
only an upper bound on TFRC throughput. An important open
problem lies in a lower bound: if conservative, how conserva-
tive can TFRC be? A lower bound in combination with an upper
bound provides information on how well TFRC tracks the target
throughput, and whether the throughput difference is a funda-
mental property of TFRC.

event difference ratio of TFRC and TCP is signiﬁcantly larger
than that of CBR and TCP when measured under M1, so we get
TCP instead. This implies that there exist
TFRC
other forces in place than R1. In M1, TFRC has a signiﬁcantly
lower sending rate than TCP and CBR (see bottom of Fig. 4
where TFRC has from 2 to 4 times less throughput than TCP).
This “inversion” in the loss event difference ratios can be ex-
plained by Theorem 4.1, which states the lower sending rate of
TFRC can force TFRC to have a higher loss event rate than TCP.
Another interesting observation we make from Fig. 4 is that
the loss event rate difference ratio of TFRC and TCP and that
of CBR and TCP in M1 are positively correlated to the loss
event rates and also to the throughput difference ratio of TCP
and TFRC (see bottom of Fig. 4). In other words, the effects of
R1 and R4 also tend to increase as the loss rate increases, which
is shown by the increasing loss event rate difference ratios of
CBR and TFRC, and of TFRC and TCP in M1. We believe that
these correlations are why TFRC has a signiﬁcantly bigger drop
in throughput under high loss rates. We need further study to
provide a theoretical reason for these correlations.
We have not yet shown the case for R5 where TFRC has a
higher sending rate but a lower loss event rate than TCP although
the experiments with CBR ﬂows indicate a strong likelihood for
R5. In Section VI, we observe this case indeed arises from the
practice, but we ﬁnd that the phenomenon is highly correlated
with the RTO estimation of TFRC. Since it requires further ex-
planation about the behavior of TFRC, we defer that discussion
to a later section. Instead, we conduct the following simple ex-
periments. To the earlier experimental setup with CBR, we add
another type of TFRC ﬂows in which the output of (1) is multi-
plied by a constant factor at each time a feedback throughput is
given to the TFRC sender for rate adjustment; it effectively (and
also artiﬁcially) increases the sending rate of TFRC. According
to R5, these ﬂows must have a lower loss event rate than TCP
which is indeed shown in Fig. 5. In the ﬁgure, the TFRC ﬂow
with scale factor 4 has a distinctively lower loss event rate than
TCP as its sending rate gets almost four times larger than TCP.
Also we observe that the loss event rates of the TFRC ﬂows tend
to increase faster than TCP as the network load increases. It is
because the effect of R1 also increases along with loss event
rates, as shown in the bottom of Fig. 4. It can be viewed that the
“scaled” versions of TFRC will be less responsive to conges-
tion than the original TFRC since it sends at a higher rate and
