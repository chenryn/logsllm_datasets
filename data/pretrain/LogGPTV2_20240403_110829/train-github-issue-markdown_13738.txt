I use the Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down feature very often, so I can scroll a limited
amount of distance without losing my place. This has the advantage of allowing
me to use the mouse less for view adjustment.
I've noticed that there is a difference between how this behaves in the full
Visual Studio and in Code. In Visual Studio, when you use Ctrl-Up/Down and the
view moves such that the cursor is at the limit of the screen, then the editor
will advance the cursor such that it remains on the last line visible. Code,
however, does not do this, so the next time you hit a key (e.g. a cursor key
without pressing Ctrl) then the view resets back to the line you were
originally on which is quite jarring.
