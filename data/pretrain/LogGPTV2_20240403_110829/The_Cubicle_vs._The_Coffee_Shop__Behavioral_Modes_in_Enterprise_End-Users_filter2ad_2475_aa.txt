**Abstract:**
Traditionally, user traffic profiling is performed by analyzing traffic traces collected at aggregation points within the network. However, modern enterprise networks have a highly mobile workforce that frequently moves in and out of the physical perimeter of the enterprise. As a result, an in-network monitor is unlikely to capture complete user activity traces when users are outside the enterprise perimeter. Different environments, such as the cubicle and the coffee shop, may impose different constraints and lead to varied behavioral modes. This raises the question: is the profile of a user constructed in one environment representative of the same user in another environment?

In this paper, we address this question for the mobile population of an enterprise. Using real corporate traffic traces collected from nearly 400 end-hosts over approximately 5 weeks, we study how end-host usage differs across three environments: inside the enterprise, outside the enterprise but using a VPN, and entirely outside the enterprise network. We examine three types of features: (i) environment lifetimes, (ii) relative usage statistics of network services, and (iii) outlier detection thresholds used for anomaly detection. Our findings indicate significant diversity in end-host behavior across these environments, suggesting that profiles computed for a user in one environment yield inaccurate representations of the same user in a different environment.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional studies of end-user behavior in a network typically rely on traffic traces collected from network aggregation points such as routers, switches, and firewalls. In modern enterprise networks, a large sub-population is mobile, with laptop users moving seamlessly in and out of the corporate office daily. When outside, end-hosts are used in various locations such as homes, airport lounges, and coffee shops. The enterprise's VPN infrastructure ensures that users remain connected to corporate resources. With the growing trend towards flexible telecommuting policies and the ubiquity of network connectivity, users spend fewer hours physically within the office cubicle or a single work locale.

Usage models differ significantly inside and outside the office due to various factors. Infrastructure services like email, directory, and print services may be unavailable when users are outside the enterprise. Additionally, external locations often have resource limitations, such as less bandwidth and security, which can affect activities like streaming music or checking bank accounts. Conversely, the corporate acceptable usage policy may prohibit peer-to-peer file sharing applications on the corporate LAN, while it may be a common application at home.

Previous work on building user-based profiles, such as in [1,2,3,4,5], does not consider the modality of the end-host when it is outside the enterprise. We argue that the increasing trend of working outside the office and the distinct "usage-models" across different environments render the single-view profile of the end-host (generated from enterprise measurements alone) incomplete. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that a single static profile for an end-host is inconsistent and/or incomplete, with important implications for enterprise security, network design, capacity planning, and provisioning.

We analyze detailed traffic traces from a real corporate enterprise, collected directly on the end-hosts themselves. This approach contrasts with previous studies based on aggregate traffic, such as in [6,7]. By collecting traces in-situ, we can accurately track a host's traffic even when its address, location, or network interface changes, avoiding the difficulties posed by DHCP address changes and host mobility.

In this initial exploration of the "environment diversity" hypothesis, we focus on three distinct types of features: (i) the median duration of a user's presence in each environment, (ii) the relative usage of network services (destination IP ports) per environment, and (iii) outlier detection thresholds (the 95th percentile) for TCP/UDP/ICMP connection counts used for anomaly detection.

Our contributions improve and clarify our understanding of end-host user profiles. Although our central hypothesis—that profiles need to change across environments—seems intuitive, there has been no previous research quantifying this. This paper aims to fill this gap in end-host traffic characterization.

## 2. Data Description

Our dataset consists of packet traces collected from nearly 400 enterprise end-hosts (5% desktops and 95% laptops) over approximately 5 weeks. A novel aspect of these traces is that they were collected directly on the individual end-hosts, providing visibility into the end-host's traffic even when it leaves the office environment. Participants in our data collection were geographically distributed: 73% from the United States, 13% from Asia, 11% from Europe, and less than 1% from Israel, Ireland, and Latin America. All but a few users were based in large offices in metropolitan areas. All hosts ran a corporate standard build of Windows XP.

We solicited employees to participate in the trace collection through organizational mailing lists, newsletters, and other communication channels. Cash prizes were offered as an incentive. Participants explicitly downloaded and installed the data collection software on their personal machines, thereby giving consent. Approximately 4,000 employees were solicited, and about 1 in 10 installed the software. Overall, the data collection effort yielded approximately 400 GB of traces.

The collection software was a wrapper around the windump tool, logging packets in the well-known pcap format. The wrapper tracked changes in IP address, interface, or environment, and upon such a change, windump was restarted, and a new trace file was created. Each trace file was annotated with flags indicating the active network interface, the environment, and if the logical VPN interface was active. Once installed, the software ran continuously (when the machine was on) for 5 weeks, with some users running it for a few days less due to delayed installation. Corporate policy strongly discourages the use of P2P applications, so our set of users is unlikely to be using such software, even when outside the corporate environment.

To mitigate privacy concerns, we only collected the first 150 bytes of each packet, sufficient to infer the actual external destination when packets went through the corporate proxy server. After identifying the destination, the payloads were discarded, and only the packet headers were retained. Post-processing was carried out on a central server where traces were periodically uploaded. All naming information regarding user or machine identity was discarded upon upload. Solicitation emails contained a complete description of the data to be collected, anonymizing procedures, and disclosure of how the data would be used. Due to this anonymization, we cannot determine which traces came from engineers, managers, executives, etc.

Importantly, all end-hosts in the study were personally issued, meaning a single user per host. In our corporation, each employee is given one laptop as their primary computer. Some employees, as needed, are additionally issued desktops, primarily for running tests and simulations. Most employees take their laptops home in the evening. Anecdotal evidence suggests that employees generally avoid allowing family members or others to use their computers. Therefore, we expect that the majority of our end-hosts have a single user, even when outside the corporate environment.

Although a single user may use multiple machines, our focus is on how a user uses a particular machine, which impacts whether a single machine should switch profiles as it, together with the user, moves between environments. It does not matter what the user does with other machines.

## 3. Diversity Across Environments

Users move between three different environments: inside, vpn, and outside. In the "inside" environment (the corporate network), the end-host is typically connected to the office LAN via a wired Ethernet connection, though occasionally via wireless. In our enterprise, employees use laptops as their primary computer system, moving between docking stations, meeting rooms, and corporate cafeterias. In the "vpn" environment, users launch a VPN client that logically connects them to the office LAN. Users in this environment could be outside the office (the common case) or inside, using an unsecured wireless network as a gateway to the VPN. Finally, in the "outside" environment, the user is physically outside the enterprise network and does not have access to any enterprise infrastructure services (email, file & print servers, etc.).

As an initial glimpse into our data, we show the movements of two users between these environments over a three-week timeline. The width of contiguous blocks denotes occupancy in that environment. First, we observe that both users use all three distinct environments, which is true for the vast majority of users. Second, we note that these two users have very different behaviors in terms of the time spent in each environment and how frequently they switch between environments. The user on the right is primarily in the "vpn" environment, indicating frequent travel or remote work. This user also tends to leave the VPN connection open during much of the weekend, possibly to respond quickly to emails or for perceived security. In contrast, the user on the left follows a more traditional pattern, using the "inside" mode during weekdays, the "vpn" mode in the evenings, and the "outside" mode on weekends. The "outside" mode likely captures non-office-related activities for this user.

It is clear that different users have different needs and patterns of accessing enterprise resources. Besides diversity across users, a single user may engage in different activities in different environments. We now explore such behavior for a variety of measures.

### 3.1 Environment Lifetimes

Motivated by the observations in Figure 1, we first examine how much time a user spends in each environment. We define "environment lifetime" as the duration of contiguous time a user spends in a particular environment before changing it, restarting the machine, or making it hibernate. Studying this statistic is crucial for network design and planning. For instance, modeling the time users spend logged onto the VPN can help network operators provision the VPN lines efficiently.

Figure 2 shows scatter plots comparing the median environment lifetimes for individual users across different environments. Figure 2(a) compares the "inside" and "outside" environments, Figure 2(b) compares the "outside" and "vpn" environments, and Figure 2(c) compares the "vpn" and "inside" environments. These figures clearly show a marked difference in how long, in a single session, a user stays in each environment. Unsurprisingly, users generally spend more time in the "inside" environment compared to the other two. The "outside" environment typically has shorter lifetimes, ranging from half to ten times less than the typical lifetimes in the "inside" or "vpn" environments. This can be attributed to the natural workday structure and the partitioning of time outside work due to domestic activities.

When comparing the environment lifetimes of the "inside" and "vpn" modes, we observe...
