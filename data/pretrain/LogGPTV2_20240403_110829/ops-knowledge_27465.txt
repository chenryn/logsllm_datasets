User: We have a query which returns 0 records sometimes when called. When you call the getQueryResults on the jobId it returns with a valid pageToken with 0 rows. This is a bit unexpected since technically there is no data. Whats worst is if you keep supplying the pageToken for subsequent data-pulls it keeps giving zero rows with valid tokens at each page.
If the query does return data initially with a pageToken and you keep using the pageToken for subsequent data pulls it returns pageToken as None after the last page giving a termination condition. 
The behavior here seems inconsistent?Is this a bug?
Here is a sample jobresponse I see:

I am using python and running queries on GAE using the BQ api
Assistant: This is a known issue that has lingered for far far too long. It is fixed in this week's release, which should go live this afternoon or tomorrow.
