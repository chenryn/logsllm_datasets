the plant as a whole. The environment includes the ground, the raw water supply, 
trees, the air we breathe and everything in-between. Initially, one might ask how such 
factors can be controlled, but the goal will become clear. Environment hardening is 
inherently more difficult on a plant that is already constructed, as opposed to a plant in

the design phase of its life. This is because the environment around a constructed plant 
has already been defined, often 50 years ago or more, and modification costs would 
simply be higher compared to hardening on an unconstructed site. 
Lighting is an important part of environmental hardening. The entire area contained 
in the DMZ, the barb wired fence encompassing the plant, should be effectively 
illuminated. Any internal or external areas monitored by cameras will, of course, require 
lighting. All PSP access points require effective lighting, whether primary, secondary or 
tertiary, whether an enclosure or a room. 
One environmental hardening technique is designing the plant in such a way that, if 
there is a release of toxic chemicals, there is little to no danger of those chemicals 
being released into a water way. Another technique would be to level the ground within 
the DMZ and remove all vegetation to increase observation range. Consider 
strategically placing vegetation as either obstacles to overcome or as obvious hiding 
points for an attack (obvious being the keyword, so that area is protected the most). 
Design roads that are lined with large trees that wind while approaching the plant to 
give the plant more time to respond to a suspiciously approaching vehicle. 
Environmental hardening serves its purpose well. 
Security personnel policies 
Policies relating to security personnel are also important. These policies dictate how 
a plant is monitored, patrolled and access controlled. They dictate how security 
recordings and records are handled, maintained and stored. Patrol schedules should 
be adhered to, but they should change on a regular basis. The gatehouse, obviously, 
should not be left unguarded. 
Social engineering mitigation  
Mitigating social engineering attacks on an industrial scale is difficult and the 
consequences of failing to do so are high. Too many people are involved in 
constructing, operating and maintaining these colossal constructs. The best that can be 
hoped for is effective and evolving training and qualified and intelligent employees. 
Communication control is an effective strategy, but can only be applied sparingly. One 
of the best ways to mitigate social engineering is to have an inherent security culture 
where everyone is aware of the threat and is held accountable if unauthorized 
information is disclosed.  Accountability also encourages erring on the side of safety, 
and verifying what information employees are allowed to disclose prior to disclosing it. 
4.4.4. Security Reviews/Audits 
Security reviews and penetration testing should be performed annually, at a minimum.  
The process of penetration testing will include a simulation of attacks on all ESPs and 
the DMZ using known hardware and software vulnerabilities, testing for incorrect

Presented at DEFCON 18, July 29th through August 1st 2010, Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas NV 
configuration or inadequate hardening, and any other potential weaknesses in existing 
processes. 
In addition to the periodic security review cycle, vulnerability databases should be 
monitored continuously for newly discovered security flaws.  Publicly available resources 
like the National Vulnerability Database operated by the NIST (http://nvd.nist.gov) and 
the Open Source Vulnerability Database (http://odvdb.org) are valuable resources for 
keeping up to date with emerging security threats. Tools to assist in vulnerability 
assessments were discussed in section  4.4.2.3 B. 
The review should include the following steps at a minimum the results of which 
should be documented and preserved indefinitely for future audits. 
• Evaluate all existing physical and electronic access points and verify that no new 
unauthorized or undocumented access points have been added.  Confirm that all 
ESPs and PSPs are still in place and operating as intended. 
• Review all physical, electronic and informational user accounts for unauthorized 
changes to account information, access rights and account passwords.  Verify all 
account information is current, and no obsolete or unused accounts exist.  Ensure 
levels of access for all users are still appropriate for user responsibilities. 
• Confirm hardening policies remain in place and are effective.  This can be 
accomplished through the use of scanning software like Nmap, Zenmap or Nessus 
which can identify information about networks or devices, open ports, running 
services, and firewall status.  As previously discussed, care must be taken when 
using software of this type on a live system to ensure that it will not interfere with 
running processes. 
• Ensure the master list of cyber devices is up to date. 
• Verify that all procedures of the cyber security plan are being followed as intended 
and the no modification to procedures or policies is required. 
In the case that a vulnerability is discovered in the course of an audit, remediation of 
the vulnerability should take place immediately.  All vulnerabilities should be treated as 
SC process vulnerability = (confidentiality, high), (integrity, high), (availability, high).  If a 
vulnerability cannot be remediated an exception should be created and potential effects 
of the vulnerability should be mitigated to the best extend possible.  Remediation should 
include the following considerations. 
• Temporary measures should be taken to secure the system until permanent 
remediation is available. 
• Patches are often available from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and 
should be considered if feasible. 
• Patches should be obtained as soon as possible and documented including the 
procedure for installing the updates.  The entire patching process and the patch 
itself should be tested in a lab environment before installation into the live 
environment to test for effectiveness and any possible interferences or side effects.

• Update any existing documentation and procedures to incorporate changes made 
by the remediation.  Ensure all system users are aware of these changes. Rescan 
for configuration data and backups and ensure all active ports, programs and 
services have a valid justification. 
4.4.5. Incident Response Planning 
Incidence response plan, also known as an emergency response plan, should be 
developed and should include a list of all level 1, 2 and 3 devices and associated 
validated recovery plans and additional response action plans. Details and contact 
information for whom to report the incident to and the conditions for considering an 
incident reportable should be defined. All data associated with an incident should be 
considered SC industrial incident = (confidentiality, high), (integrity, high), (availability, 
high). All data pertaining to an incident should be kept indefinitely. 
 Roles and responsibilities of key response personnel need to be clearly defined and 
personnel need to understand and be prepared for their role; they will not have time to 
consult a procedure to determine where they are supposed to be if there is an 
emergency. This is why technical and specialized cyber security training and drills are 
required. Drills should occur at least once during every outage. If the control system is 
robust enough, live simulations may be appropriate. Drills should include, but are by no 
means limited to, incident response, immediate analysis followed by mitigation, backup 
restoration and perhaps even partial evacuation.  
“Awareness” training needs to occur regularly within the entire organization; this 
usually takes the form of monthly emails, posters, appropriate use banners and perhaps 
“lunch and learns” on the subject. Additionally, employees are required to annually train 
on policies, which is usually followed by a simple test. This can have a positive effect on 
security, but often policies are not enforced so the training can be a moot point. Ideally, 
all employees on the site should be trained in the organizations security objectives, 
common attack methodologies, common signs of attack and how to respond. The 
following guides are recommended to assist in developing response plans: 
• NIST SP800-61, “Computer Security Incident Handling Guide” 
• NIST SP800-86, “Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident 
Response” 
5. Case Study: Security Flaws and Mitigation of a PLC 
An additional topic discussed during the presentation of this paper at DEFCON 18 was a 
physical example of the security flaws of a discrete PLC from an undisclosed manufacturer, 
and the consequences therein. A generic Ethernet capable model frequently found on the plant 
floor was selected; various attack scenarios were demonstrated for the systems commonly run 
by the device. The demonstration was not intended to expose any single vulnerability on the 
selected device; the demonstration was intended to convey a sense of urgency in remediating

security flaws and replacing devices with inherently lax security because there is currently an 
opportunity to prevent a disaster before it occurs. For additional information, check the

6. Conclusions 
Although focused mainly on the power industry, the same techniques are valid for nearly 
any type of large industrial plant. Many sectors are beginning to leisurely become acquainted 
with a world where cyber security is truly a necessary field; this includes government, utilities, 
industry, manufacturing, food production, and other large scale operations. The current languid 
and often idle pace is understandable; risks and threats are increasing, vulnerabilities are often 
dealt with ineffectively, yet there haven’t been any major incidences so the perceived danger 
is low. This misperception was hopefully alleviated for the reader by seeing security flaws 
inherent in process control networks and devices, by seeing both theoretical and real world 
examples of vulnerabilities and attack scenarios that could be exploited locally or remotely 
(intentionally or unintentionally) and by examining a generally bleak security situation. It should 
be clear to the reader that a modern power plant needs to be built with security as a primary 
goal, with security inherent in the design. 
Policies required to meet these demands are currently often weak, unenforced or 
predictable and may need significant modification by subject matter experts. Distinct 
procedures and processes for managing both the electronic and the physical security of a 
large industrial facility were presented as well as how to manage associated change, working 
policies into existing procedures whenever possible. Governances were briefly discussed; the 
reader should take away an understanding of the complexity of compliance and an 
understanding of the need to simplify and quantify overlapping requirements by creating 
effective and distinct policies and procedures, automating whenever possible. 
The defense-in-depth military tactic & strategy should be applied liberally to systems via 
projects, operations and maintenance using some form of every electronic and physical 
security hardening subject previously discussed on all levels of security. The reader should 
now have an understanding of the importance of designing a coherent, comprehensive, open 
ended and easily automatable method for the classification of sites, systems and devices 
based on severity of attack, likeliness of attack and ease of attack as well as the categorization 
of information. The reader should fully understand how classifications can be used to their 
advantage to provide cost savings and mitigate highest risk first. The methods, techniques and 
tools for mitigation of risk on all levels were presented, and the importance of varying these 
tactics should be clear. Due to the high risk to the plant and the bulk electric system, and large 
scope of any compliance effort, it is far better to set a goal of exceeding compliance using 
automated systems rather than meeting compliance using manual labor intensive methods; 
this is the only real approach to guarantee compliance and effectively maintain a coherent 
security strategy.  
The challenge is great, the risks are great, and choices need to be made. In order to 
effectively secure our grid, we will need leadership and continuity from the top down of the

government’s chain of command as well as from the top down of the power sector’s chain of 
command. We need to close the divide between the IT world and the industrial world. The risks 
are increasing continuously, as they always do as technology progresses. The paper was not 
intended to expose any single vulnerability on any given site; the paper was intended to 
convey a sense of urgency in remediating systemic security flaws and replacing devices with 
inherently lax security because there is currently an opportunity to prevent a disaster before it 
occurs. With a concentrated effort and increased awareness, the security of the control 
systems in an industrial plant can be brought to up to the standard deserving of the nation’s 
most important infrastructure, and it’s time we do so.
