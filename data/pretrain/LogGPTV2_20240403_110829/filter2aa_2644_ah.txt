### Environmental Hardening in Power Plants

The environment of a power plant encompasses the ground, water supply, trees, air, and everything in between. Initially, one might question how these factors can be controlled, but the goal will become clear. Environmental hardening is inherently more challenging for an already-constructed plant compared to one in the design phase. This is because the environment around a constructed plant has been defined, often 50 years ago or more, and modification costs are higher.

#### Lighting
Effective lighting is a crucial aspect of environmental hardening. The entire area within the DMZ, including the barbed-wire fence surrounding the plant, should be well-illuminated. Any internal or external areas monitored by cameras require adequate lighting. All PSP access points, whether primary, secondary, or tertiary, and whether an enclosure or a room, must be effectively lit.

#### Design Considerations
One technique for environmental hardening is designing the plant to minimize the risk of toxic chemical release into waterways. Another approach is to level the ground within the DMZ and remove vegetation to increase observation range. Strategically placing vegetation as obstacles or hiding points (with the key being that they are obvious) can enhance security. Roads leading to the plant can be designed with winding paths lined with large trees to provide more time for response to suspicious vehicles.

### Security Personnel Policies
Policies related to security personnel are essential. These policies dictate how the plant is monitored, patrolled, and access-controlled. They also cover the handling, maintenance, and storage of security recordings and records. Patrol schedules should be adhered to but changed regularly. The gatehouse should never be left unguarded.

### Social Engineering Mitigation
Mitigating social engineering attacks on an industrial scale is challenging, and the consequences of failure are severe. Effective and evolving training, along with qualified and intelligent employees, is crucial. Communication control can be effective but must be used sparingly. An inherent security culture, where everyone is aware of the threat and held accountable for unauthorized information disclosure, is one of the best ways to mitigate social engineering. Accountability encourages safety and verifies what information employees are allowed to disclose.

### Security Reviews and Audits
Security reviews and penetration testing should be conducted at least annually. Penetration testing includes simulating attacks on all ESPs and the DMZ using known hardware and software vulnerabilities, testing for incorrect configurations or inadequate hardening, and identifying other potential weaknesses. Continuous monitoring of vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NIST) and the Open Source Vulnerability Database, is essential.

#### Review Steps
1. **Access Points:** Evaluate all existing physical and electronic access points and verify that no new unauthorized or undocumented access points have been added. Confirm that all ESPs and PSPs are still in place and operating as intended.
2. **User Accounts:** Review all physical, electronic, and informational user accounts for unauthorized changes. Ensure account information is current, and no obsolete or unused accounts exist. Verify that levels of access are appropriate for user responsibilities.
3. **Hardening Policies:** Confirm that hardening policies remain in place and are effective. Use scanning software like Nmap, Zenmap, or Nessus to identify network and device information, open ports, running services, and firewall status.
4. **Cyber Devices List:** Ensure the master list of cyber devices is up to date.
5. **Procedure Adherence:** Verify that all procedures of the cybersecurity plan are being followed as intended and that no modifications to procedures or policies are required.

If a vulnerability is discovered, immediate remediation is necessary. Temporary measures should secure the system until permanent remediation is available. Patches from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) should be considered if feasible. The patching process should be tested in a lab environment before live installation.

### Incident Response Planning
An incident response plan, also known as an emergency response plan, should include a list of all level 1, 2, and 3 devices and associated validated recovery plans. Contact information and conditions for reporting incidents should be defined. All data related to an incident should be treated as highly confidential, with integrity and availability being high priorities. Data should be kept indefinitely.

Key response personnel roles and responsibilities must be clearly defined, and personnel should be prepared for their roles. Regular technical and specialized cybersecurity training and drills are required. Drills should occur at least once during every outage and may include incident response, analysis, mitigation, backup restoration, and partial evacuation.

Regular "awareness" training, such as monthly emails, posters, and lunch-and-learn sessions, should be conducted. Employees should also undergo annual policy training followed by a simple test. Ideally, all employees should be trained in the organization's security objectives, common attack methodologies, signs of attack, and response procedures.

### Case Study: Security Flaws and Mitigation of a PLC
During the presentation at DEFCON 18, a physical example of the security flaws of a discrete PLC from an undisclosed manufacturer was discussed. A generic Ethernet-capable model frequently found on the plant floor was selected, and various attack scenarios were demonstrated. The demonstration aimed to convey the urgency of remediating security flaws and replacing devices with inherently lax security to prevent disasters.

### Conclusions
Although focused on the power industry, the techniques discussed are applicable to any large industrial plant. Many sectors are beginning to recognize the necessity of cybersecurity, including government, utilities, manufacturing, and food production. Risks and threats are increasing, yet there haven't been major incidents, leading to a low perceived danger. This paper aims to highlight the importance of building modern power plants with security as a primary goal.

Policies need to be strengthened, enforced, and made less predictable. Procedures for managing both electronic and physical security should be integrated into existing processes. The defense-in-depth strategy should be applied liberally, and a coherent, comprehensive, and easily automatable method for classifying sites, systems, and devices based on attack severity, likelihood, and ease should be developed.

The challenge is significant, and leadership and continuity from both the government and the power sector are needed. We must close the divide between the IT and industrial worlds. With a concentrated effort and increased awareness, the security of control systems in industrial plants can be brought to the standard deserving of the nation's most important infrastructure.
