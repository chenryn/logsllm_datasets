• Contributor to Mobile Radio Technology 
(www.mrtmag.com) since January 2003.
• Hearing policy wonks talk about 700 MHz, 
unlicensed spectrum in D.C. for years.
• Day job: Editor-in-Chief, VON Magazine

Unlicensed TV White Spaces
• What is “White Spaces”?
• How did the concept get created?
• Technical proposals - History
• Tech Specifics as of July 31, 2006
• Final Word in October
What is White Spaces?
• “Analog”/NTSC TV uses VHF and UHF
– Today we have TV channels 2-69
– As of Feb 18, 2009, channels 2-51 will be for TV, and 
all digital
• (Assuming no last minute political panic)
• In any given geographic area, one can receive 
only a handful of stations due to geography, 
careful licensing
• 51 channels -handful = LOTS of open unused, 
“white spaces” channels
• Each DTV channel = 6 MHz, 27 Mbps broadcast 
bandwidth using existing DTV spec
Why is the 700 MHz RF band loved 
and coveted by all?
• Propagation characteristics
– Go through walls, obstacles
– In a licensed use mode, one can cover a city with 1 or 
2 base stations vs. lots of cells/transmitters in Wi-Fi 
and higher frequencies.
• There’s a lot of white spaces space available, 
the farther away from cities you go.
– Policy wonks see this as a savior for the “Digital 
Divide” in Rural America
FYI: There’s a lot of lurking 
LICENSED 700 MHz space
• First auction 
– Lot of speculators sitting on it
• Largest Aloha Networks, Vulcan Ventures
• Second auction coming up
– Speculation cable, Google, others may raise 
money
– Lot of political in-fighting on how it should be 
conducted
• Google pushing for liberalized auction rules
• CTIA (the cell guys) like current model
How did White Spaces created?
• Review of spectrum policy by wonks
– Hey, there’s all this bandwidth…
• New America Foundation (www.newamerica.net)
• Success of Wi-Fi
• Demand for more unlicensed bandwidth
– FCC, Congress both recognize needs
• Cognitive/smart radio
– Enabling technology to “look”
– DARPA has done work on cognitive radio
The Recent History of White 
Spaces Maneuvers
• FCC Notice – May 04
• It won’t be Part 15 (WiFi) 
• First round of comments
– “White Spaces” Alliance
– Motorola
– Association for Maximum Service Television
• FCC addresses comments July 2007 
– (Not before DEFCON materials deadline )
FCC Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking
• Released on May 13, 2004. 
• Written in part by Ed Thomas, FCC, Office of 
Engineering and Technology
• Statement to open up white spaces channels, 
solicited comments
• Suggested approaches to avoid interference
– “Guard signal” to indicate open freqs
– Geolocation (Where am I? Look at database)
– Spectrum sensing (Sense before send)
NAB (of course) not happy
• Response by Association for Maximum 
Television 
• Generated worst-case scenarios for white space
– 154 pages in initial response
• Tried to convince FCC that it would Never Work.
White Spaces Devices won’t be 
Part 15 (Wi-Fi)
• Part 15 
– Up to 1 watt power
– Must take interference
– Not cause interference
• Comments from White Spaces Alliance, Moto 
indicate Part 15 not workable.
• Typical White Spaces Device
– Under 1 watt (To avoid interference)
– Need a cognitive/smart radio
• “Look before broadcast” and/or geolocation
Cognitive/smart radio
• Smart radio should be able to:
– Sense environment
– Avoid broadcasting on channels in use
• TV most obvious, also some first responders, and licensed 
wireless microphones.
– Find the unused bandwidth
– Adjust power accordingly
– Sounds like Electronic Warfare, without the War…
– Can be used for TV white spaces (700 MHz), other 
bands
“White Spaces” Alliance comments
• Dell, Google, HP, Intel, Microsoft, Philips
– Contributor – Edmond J. Thomas
• Block off channels 2-20 (and 37)
– Avoid interference with existing licensed users (LMR)
– Reserve lower end for potential public safety white 
spaces use
• Geolocation too cumbersome
• Doesn’t even talk about “guard” channel
• Spectrum sensing “smart” radio only way to go.
• “And here’s a toy Microsoft built…”
The Toy That Microsoft Built
The Toy That Microsoft Built
• “Microsoft TV White Spaces Development 
Platform Version 1”
• (Ignorant) Press made it sound like a 
finished consumer device
• Prototyping platform to “explore, develop 
and evaluate technologies required to 
create a commercially viable cognitive 
radio-based communications network 
product”
Why White Spaces gave FCC the 
Device
• Enable FCC test division to work with 
spectrum scanning, gain confidence
– Test sensitivity of process
– Turn knobs up (more power) and down (less 
power)
– Test interference with existing devices
– Test waveforms to ID DTV, NTSC, wireless 
mics
Functions of MS-TV-WS-DP-V1
• Enable developers to:
– Create spectrum scanning and signal recognition 
software & hardware used to co-exist and avoid 
interfering with incumbent (TV) operators
– Develop & refine transmit power control algorithms
– Explore & test waveforms & modulation techniques 
– Perform on-air propagation & coverage 
measurements
• VERY important in FCC test lab environment
Under the hood of MS…DP-V1
• Two system assemblies
– Windows-based PC using IE browser as 
interface
– Three boxes containing wide-band spectrum 
scanner and network processor and a tunable 
UHF half-duplex transceiver controlled by the 
network processor
MS…DP-V1 : How it works
• Spectrum scanner goes through UHF 21- 
51, does 2048 FFT
• Signature feature templates for DTV and 
NTSC applied to FFT 
• Non-occupied channels are declared 
potential white space, scanned for narrow- 
band incumbents such as wireless mics.
• Display scanner control and discovery info 
using (whatelse?) MS IE.
Motorola comments
• Much more conservative approach
– Block off 2-21, also throw in two other channels for 
public safety use
• Geolocation initially used, with spectrum sensing 
maybe later
• Spectrum sensing deemed too “immature”
– Hmm, compared to…?
• No discussion on guard band
• In interview, reluctant to talk about potential 
demo device/prototype lurking about
New America Comments
• Want all TV white spaces, no technical 
excuse not to grab ‘em
• Whitespaces Coalition
– Picked block of 2-20 because they didn’t want 
big antennas (Mobile device use)
• Motorola
– Business model geared to fixed broadband, 
so geolocation works better; i.e. dealer 
installed Canopy-type devices
FCC addresses comments in July 
2007
• Not announced as of July 6, 2007
• This slide to be updated for DEFCON 
presentation
What is expected to be finalized
• Technical specifications
• Final Report and Order Issued in October 
2007
Real World Implementation by 
???
• Consumer electronics vendors hot to go
• Intel, Philips always needs to sell more chips, 
devices
• Google wants Yet Another Way Around The 
Man (In this case, Telcos & Cable)
• Software is relatively straight-forward
– After all, Microsoft did it with one engineer and IE…
– Maybe by late 2008 or early 2008, if we don’t get into 
“standards”
• 802.11n still isn’t finalized
