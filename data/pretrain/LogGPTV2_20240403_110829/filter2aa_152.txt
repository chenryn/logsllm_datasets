### Unlicensed TV White Spaces
- **Definition of "White Spaces"**
- **Origin and Development of the Concept**
- **Technical Proposals and History**
- **Technical Details as of July 31, 2006**
- **Final Decision Expected in October**

#### What are White Spaces?
- **Analog/NTSC TV Channels**: Use VHF and UHF frequencies.
- **Current Channels**: 2-69.
- **Post-Transition Channels (by Feb 18, 2009)**: 2-51, all digital.
- **Geographic Limitations**: Only a few stations can be received in any given area due to geography and licensing.
- **Unused Channels**: Many channels will be left unused, creating "white spaces."
- **Bandwidth Potential**: Each DTV channel provides 6 MHz, supporting up to 27 Mbps.

#### Why is the 700 MHz Band So Valuable?
- **Propagation Characteristics**: Can penetrate walls and obstacles.
- **Coverage Efficiency**: A single or two base stations can cover a city, compared to multiple cells in Wi-Fi.
- **Rural Connectivity**: Significant potential for bridging the "Digital Divide" in rural areas.

#### Licensed 700 MHz Spectrum
- **First Auction**: Many speculators acquired licenses but have not utilized them.
- **Key Players**: Aloha Networks, Vulcan Ventures.
- **Second Auction**: Anticipated participation from cable companies, Google, and others.
- **Political Debates**: Ongoing discussions about auction rules and regulations.
- **Google's Stance**: Advocating for more liberalized auction rules.
- **CTIA's Position**: Prefers the current model.

#### How Were White Spaces Created?
- **Spectrum Policy Review**: Recognized the abundance of unused bandwidth.
- **New America Foundation**: Promoted the concept.
- **Wi-Fi Success**: Demonstrated the demand for unlicensed bandwidth.
- **FCC and Congressional Recognition**: Acknowledged the need for more unlicensed spectrum.
- **Cognitive/Smart Radio**: Enabling technology for dynamic spectrum use.

#### Recent Developments in White Spaces
- **FCC Notice (May 2004)**: Initial proposal to open white spaces.
- **Initial Comments**: From the "White Spaces" Alliance, Motorola, and the Association for Maximum Service Television.
- **FCC Response (July 2007)**: Addressed the comments, though details were not finalized by the DEFCON materials deadline.

#### FCC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
- **Released on May 13, 2004**.
- **Drafted by Ed Thomas, FCC, Office of Engineering and Technology**.
- **Proposal to Open White Spaces**: Solicited public comments.
- **Suggested Interference Mitigation Techniques**:
  - Guard signals to indicate open frequencies.
  - Geolocation (determining location via a database).
  - Spectrum sensing (detecting and avoiding active frequencies).

#### NAB's Opposition
- **Response by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)**: Submitted a 154-page document detailing worst-case scenarios.
- **Position**: Argued that white spaces would never work and cause significant interference.

#### White Spaces Devices and Part 15
- **Part 15 Regulations**:
  - Up to 1 watt power.
  - Must accept interference.
  - Must not cause interference.
- **Industry Feedback**: Indicated that Part 15 regulations are not suitable for white spaces devices.
- **Proposed Device Specifications**:
  - Power under 1 watt to avoid interference.
  - Cognitive/smart radio capabilities to detect and avoid active channels.

#### Cognitive/Smart Radio
- **Capabilities**:
  - Sense the environment.
  - Avoid broadcasting on used channels (e.g., TV, first responders, wireless microphones).
  - Find and use unused bandwidth.
  - Adjust power levels accordingly.
  - Similar to electronic warfare techniques, but for peaceful purposes.

#### "White Spaces" Alliance Comments
- **Members**: Dell, Google, HP, Intel, Microsoft, Philips.
- **Contributor**: Edmond J. Thomas.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Block off channels 2-20 and 37 to avoid interference with licensed users.
  - Reserve lower channels for potential public safety use.
  - Geolocation deemed cumbersome.
  - Spectrum sensing as the preferred method.
  - Demonstration of a prototype device by Microsoft.

#### Microsoft's Prototype
- **Microsoft TV White Spaces Development Platform Version 1**.
- **Misunderstood by Media**: Often reported as a finished consumer product.
- **Purpose**: To explore, develop, and evaluate technologies for a commercially viable cognitive radio network.
- **Functions**:
  - Spectrum scanning and signal recognition.
  - Transmit power control algorithms.
  - Waveform and modulation testing.
  - On-air propagation and coverage measurements.

#### Motorola's Approach
- **Conservative Proposal**:
  - Block off channels 2-21 and additional channels for public safety.
  - Initial use of geolocation, with potential future integration of spectrum sensing.
  - Reluctant to discuss specific prototype devices.

#### New America Foundation's Stance
- **Advocacy**: For full utilization of TV white spaces.
- **Whitespaces Coalition**: Focused on mobile device compatibility.
- **Motorola's Business Model**: Geared towards fixed broadband, favoring geolocation.

#### FCC's Final Decision
- **Expected in October 2007**.
- **Technical Specifications and Final Report and Order**.

#### Real-World Implementation
- **Consumer Electronics Industry**: Eager to develop new products.
- **Intel and Philips**: Motivated to sell more chips and devices.
- **Google's Interest**: To provide an alternative to traditional telcos and cable providers.
- **Software Development**: Relatively straightforward, with potential for rapid deployment.
- **Standards Consideration**: Need to avoid getting bogged down in standardization processes, similar to the ongoing 802.11n finalization.
