### About Me:
- **Background**: 
  - Civil Engineering (MS, PE)
  - Passion for computers and wireless technology
  - Licensed HAM (Amateur Radio Operator)
- **Interests**:
  - Automation (e.g., chicken coop, sprinklers)
  - DEF CON and Wireless CTFs
- **Current Role**:
  - Security Engineer at Barracuda Networks
  - Specializations: Incident Response, Penetration Testing, Red/Blue Team Operations, Social Engineering, Phishing Campaigns, Bug Bounties, Infrastructure Scanning, Product Team Relations, 2FA, IPAM

### Agenda:
1. What is a rogue cell tower?
2. Why should you care about rogue cell towers?
3. How can you detect a rogue cell tower?
4. How do you find a rogue cell tower?
5. How do you build a detector at home?
6. You’ve detected a rogue tower… now what?

### What is a Rogue Cell Tower?
- **Definition**: A device that mimics a legitimate cell phone tower to intercept and collect data from mobile devices.
- **Aliases**: IMSI catchers, interceptors, cell-site simulators, Stingrays.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Collect metadata (call length, dialed numbers).
  - In some cases, intercept the content of messages, calls, and data.

### Usage of Cell Simulators Today:
- **United States**:
  - Used by law enforcement for surveillance.
  - ACLU has identified 66 agencies and 24 states with Stingrays.
  - Deployed in monitoring demonstrations and political protests.
  - DIY IMSI-catchers are possible (e.g., DEFCON 18: Practical Cellphone Spying by Chris Paget).
- **Abroad**:
  - Reported use in Ireland, UK, China, Germany, Norway, South Africa.
  - Chinese spammers have used them for spam and phishing.
  - Utilized by governments and corporations.

### Understanding IMSI:
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)**:
  - A unique identifier for a device on the cell network.
  - Typically 15 digits long.
  - Composed of:
    - MCC (Mobile Country Code)
    - MNC (Mobile Network Code)
    - MSIN (Mobile Subscription Identification Number)

### Why Should You Care?
- **Risks**:
  - Automatic connection to cell site simulators.
  - Potential theft of personal information.
  - Tracking and data interception by hackers.
  - Corporate espionage and privacy risks.
  - Low-cost hardware makes it accessible to many.

### Building a Detector:
- **Reasons**:
  - Existing apps for Android phones require specific models and root access.
  - Desired features:
    - Cost-effective (~$50/device).
    - Set-and-forget operation.
    - Anomaly alerts.
    - Networkable with multiple devices.

### Detecting a Rogue Cell Tower:
- **Cell Tower Information**:
  - ARFCN (Absolute radio frequency channel number)
  - MCC (Mobile Country Code)
  - MNC (Mobile Network Code)
  - Cell ID (Unique identifier within a large area)
  - LAC (Location area code)
  - Txp (Transmit power maximum)
  - Neighboring cells
- **Detection Method**:
  - Monitor these values over time to establish a baseline.
  - Deviations may indicate maintenance, network changes, or a rogue tower.

### Locating a Tower:
- **Techniques**:
  - Combine unique cell tower data, receive power, and GPS coordinates.
  - Use trilateration with multiple detectors to approximate the location.
  - Regression formulas and open-source GIS software for more accurate results.
  - TDOA (Time difference of arrival) for even better accuracy.

### Building Your Own Detector:
- **Components**:
  - Raspberry Pi 3
  - SIM900 GSM Module
  - Serial GPS module
  - Software-defined radio (SDR)
  - Scrap wood and hot glue
- **Cost**:
  - Total: ~$52
- **Setup**:
  - Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian OS
  - SIM900 GSM Module for cellular data
  - Adafruit Ultimate GPS module for positioning
  - SDR for raw GSM traffic (optional)

### Data Collection and Visualization:
- **Data Storage**:
  - SQLite database for later analysis.
- **Visualization**:
  - QGIS for map generation.
  - Python automation for dynamic updates.
- **Alerts**:
  - Email, SMS (via Twilio), Push notifications (via PushOver).

### Next Steps:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Turn off your phone if a rogue tower is detected.
  - Analyze the collected data.
  - Conduct further investigation.
