Question: In which of the following scenarios would the use of cryptographic hash functions NOT be suitable for ensuring the integrity of a downloaded file? Select all that apply.
"A": "The adversary is capable of tampering with the hash value provided by the file's creators along with the file itself.",
"B": "The file's creators have only published the hash value on their secure official website, which is known to be free from adversarial control.",
"C": "The hash function used by the file's creators is known to be fast and efficient, making it easy to compute hashes for large files.",
"D": "The adversary has a realistic amount of computing power, which is insufficient to break the properties of the cryptographic hash function in use."
Answer: A
