Question: "Consider the consensus mechanism in Bitcoin, which assumes the majority of users are honest. Which of the following statements are true about this assumption? Select all that apply."
 "A": "The assumption is based on the belief that it is highly improbable for a majority of users to act maliciously due to the economic incentives of maintaining a reliable system."
 "B": "The assumption is necessary because, without it, any user could unilaterally alter the blockchain without consensus."
 "C": "The assumption implies that the system is fault-tolerant and can withstand up to 50% of users being malicious without breaking consensus."
 "D": "The assumption is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility of a 51% attack, where a majority of mining power is controlled by a malicious entity."
