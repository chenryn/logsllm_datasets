User: I have project that creates dlls. These dlls are invoked from python later by special plugin system blue-sky. So in this project it's very hard to build executable file, but I need profiling. Are there any profilers that can work with pure dlls? 
I've tried Intel Amplifier, Microsoft VS2008 profiler they don't work. I've also tried Very Sleepy but its features are limited.
Assistant: You can't profile code that isn't running- that's the definition of profiling. You will need to build something that can run (an executable file) that links to the DLL and use that.
