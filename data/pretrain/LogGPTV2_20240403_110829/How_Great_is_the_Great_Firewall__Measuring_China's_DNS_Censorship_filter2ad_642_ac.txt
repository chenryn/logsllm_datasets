committed to keeping GFWatch running as long as possible,
rather than just creating it as a one-off effort.
Prior reports [38, 52, 85] and our detection of the same
censored domains via two different network paths (§3) have
conﬁrmed the centralized blocking policy of the GFW in
terms of the domains being censored. Nevertheless, we are
also interested in investigating whether the forged IPs are
consistent at different network locations, because our ulti-

of all censored responses. Similarly, even after the remarkable
increase to more than 1.7K forged IPs at the end of August,
only 600 of them are frequently injected from September to
December, occupying 99% of the censored responses. Finally,
when looking at all the censored responses and forged IPs
discovered over the whole period, the 200 most frequently
injected forged IPs discovered in April are still responsible
for more than 50% of all censored responses, whereas only
600 (33.6%) out of 1,781 forged IPs are responsible for 99%
of all censored responses, the remaining 1.1K forged IPs in
the long tail are used in only 1% of censored responses.
5.3 Static and Dynamic Injections
One of the GFW behaviors is injecting different sets of forged
IPs for different groups of censored domains. This behavior
was ﬁrst reported in [21], where the authors identify a total of
six groups of censored domains that are poisoned with differ-
ent sets of forged IPs. From data collected by GFWatch, we
have discovered a total of 11 groups shown in Table 1. Com-
paring these groups with those reported in [21], we ﬁnd ﬁve
similar groups that have the same set of forged IPs/CNAMEs,
including Groups 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Understandably, we dis-
cover more groups because our test list covers far more do-
mains compared to [21], where a ﬁxed Alexa top list of only
1M domains was used for the whole measurement period.
An instance of forged response containing a CNAME was
reported in [21] but excluded from the analysis since it did not
seem to be prevalent. However, with a larger dataset, we ﬁnd
that the injection of CNAME in forged responses can happen
in three different groups of censored domains, triggering the
GFW to inject six different CNAME answers. As depicted in
Table 1, there are 41 censored domains that can trigger the
injection of either one of the four CNAMEs listed. Domains in
Groups 1 and 2 can trigger a CNAME injection, accompanied

mate goal is to collect as many forged IPs as possible and
demystify their injection pattern to assist us in developing ef-
fective strategies for censorship detection and circumvention.
Therefore, we have also conducted an extra measurement by
probing across different network locations in China to con-
ﬁrm that the pool of forged IPs discovered by GFWatch is
representative enough. More details of this measurement are
provided in Appendix B.
Injection Frequency of Forged IPs
5.2
Due to the erratic changes in the number of forged IPs over
time, prior studies have often concluded that forged IPs are
injected randomly. Through the longitudinal measurement
conducted at scale, GFWatch has tested and detected a large
enough number of censored domains and forged IPs that al-
lows us to provide more insights into this aspect. Analyzing
the injection frequency of each forged IP, we ﬁnd that not
all forged IPs are equally injected in censored responses, i.e.,
their injection pattern is not entirely random.
Figure 8 shows the CDF of censored responses with respect
to the injection frequency of forged IPs observed in these
responses. The x-axis (in log scale) indicates the number
of forged IPs, sorted by their injection frequency. There are
three periods during which the cumulative number of forged
IPs shows different patterns (i.e., April, May to August, and
September to December, as shown in Figure 7). Thus, we
analyze the injection frequency of these three periods inde-
pendently and compare them with the injection frequency
of all forged IPs discovered over the whole period of our
measurement.
We can see that the forged IPs’ injection frequencies are
similar (almost overlapping) between the April and May–
August lines. In other words, although the number of forged
IPs increases from about 200 at the end of April to more than
1.5K over the May–August period, the initial 200 forged IPs
are still responsible for 99% of censored responses. On the
other hand, the additional 1.3K new forged IPs discovered
from May to August are in the long tail and only used in 1%

not the actual IPs of the two CNAMEs. Similarly, there are
eight distinct subgroups of domains within Group 3 that can
constantly trigger either one of the eight forged IP listed. For
example, qcc.com.tw will always trigger a forged response
of 89.31.55.106. The same pattern applies in other Groups
from 4 to 9, i.e., resolving domains within these groups will
always trigger the GFW to inject one of the forged IPs listed
on the 4th column. The remaining of about 300K censored
domains are grouped together since they trigger the GFW to
dynamically inject a much larger number of more than 560
different forged IPs.
Revealing these injection patterns for different groups of
censored domains is crucial for developing an effective strat-
egy to detect and circumvent the GFW’s DNS censorship (§6).
Especially, knowing whether a censored domain belongs to
one of the static groups (Groups 0 to 9) or the dynamic group
(Group 10) is necessary to avoid misclassifying consistent
forged responses as “legitimate” (§7).
6 Censorship Leakage and Detection
The GFW’s bidirectional DNS ﬁltering behavior has been re-
ported as the cause of poisoned DNS responses being cached
by public DNS resolvers outside China, when DNS resolution
paths unavoidably have to transit via China’s network [57, 87].
However, in this section, we show that DNS poisoning against
many domains whose authoritative name servers are located in
China is another primary reason why poisoned DNS records
have tainted many public DNS resolvers around the world.
We then show how the datasets of censored domains and
forged IPs discovered by GFWatch can help with detecting
and sanitizing poisoned resource records from public DNS
resolvers’ cache.
6.1 Geoblocking of China-based Domains
On August 8th, 2020, GFWatch detected the blockage of
www.beian.gov.cn, which is managed by the Chinese Min-
istry of Industry and Information Technology. This ser-
vice allows website owners to obtain and verify their web-
site’s Internet Content Provider (ICP) license, which is ob-
ligated to legally operate their site in China. This domain
has two authoritative name servers, dns7.hichina.com and
dns8.hichina.com, which are hosted on 16 different IPs.
However, checking against the latest MaxMind dataset [7],
we ﬁnd that all of these IPs are located inside China. Con-
sequently, the DNS censorship against this domain by the
GFW will cause DNS queries issued from outside China to
be poisoned since all resolution paths from outside China will
have to cross the GFW.
We initially attributed this blockage to an error or a miscon-
ﬁguration because previous works have sometimes noticed in-
termittent failures in the GFW [21, 45]. Furthermore, no prior
Figure 9: Visit to a domain geoblocked by the GFW ends up

studies have ever found such a strange blocking behavior—
the GFW of China censors a Chinese government website.
However, at the time of composing this paper, we are still
observing www.beian.gov.cn being censored by the GFW,
almost half a year since its ﬁrst detection. Hence, this is a
clear case of geoblocking because we can still visit this do-
main normally from our controlled machines located inside
China. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst academic
research to document this geoblocking behavior of the GFW.
Note that this geoblocking is a result of the GFW’s DNS
censorship, which is not the same as geoblocking enforced
at the server side [69]. Geoblocking of China-based websites
has been noticed previously but is enforced by their website
owners. For instance, political researchers have been using
https://www.tianyancha.com/ to investigate the owner-
ship of Chinese companies, but since 2019, this website blocks
visitors from non-Chinese IPs and shows a clear message for
the reason of denying access.
The GFW’s blocking of China-based domains using bidi-
rectional DNS ﬁltering in combination with the use of forged
IPs owned by non-Chinese entities impacts not only Internet
users in China, but also users from around the world. For in-
stance, upon visiting the aforementioned geoblocked domain
from a non-censored network outside China, we end up with
an error page served from Facebook, as shown in Figure 9.
Most ordinary Internet users would not know the under-
lying reason why their visit to a given China-based domain
(e.g., www.beian.gov.cn) that is clearly unrelated to Face-
book would end up with an error page from Facebook. The
fact that the GFW frequently changes the forged IPs used in
fake DNS responses (§5) would cause even more confusion
to the affected users. Depending on which fake IP is injected
in the spoofed response, users may encounter a different error
page from Figure 9. Even more confusing, the visit to this do-
main from outside China will intermittently succeed because
the poisoned responses injected by the GFW sometimes fail
to arrive ahead of the legitimate one (§7).
At the server side of the forged IPs being used for injecting
poisoned responses, their operators would also be puzzled as
to why many HTTP requests are sent to their servers, asking
for hostnames they do not serve. For the above example, an
error log at a Facebook server will show that someone was

trying to visit www.beian.gov.cn on a Facebook IP, which
obviously does not serve any content for that domain, thus
the returned error page. As we do not have access to the er-
ror logs of Facebook and other organizations whose IPs are
used for injecting poisoned DNS responses by the GFW, we
cannot quantify the actual cost (e.g., the overhead of serv-
ing unsolicited connections, error pages) of such an abusive
DNS redirection behavior. However, given the large number
of more than 311K censored domains discovered (§4) and
only a small pool of forged IPs being used (§5), we believe
that the GFW’s injection policy would cost these affected
organizations a non-negligible overhead on their servers. Past
