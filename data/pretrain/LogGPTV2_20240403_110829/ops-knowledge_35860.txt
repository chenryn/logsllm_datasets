User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题ssh client problem: Connection reset by peer I'm having a really annoying problem on my Ubuntu laptop.

I noticed it today, after upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04, although I'm not entirely sure this is the cause as I played with my ssh keys a few days ago.

The problem is, whenever I try to ssh to ANY host I get the following error:

Read from socket failed: Connection reset by peer


running with -vvv gives the following output:

OpenSSH_5.8p1 Debian-1ubuntu3, OpenSSL 0.9.8o 01 Jun 2010

My /etc/ssh/ssh_config:

Host *
    SendEnv LANG LC_*
    HashKnownHosts yes
    GSSAPIAuthentication no
    GSSAPIDelegateCredentials no


I can connect to my laptop from any other server via ssh, and I can also ssh localhost from my laptop successfully.

I can connect to all these other server from other laptops, and I don't see anything in the logs of the other servers regarding my failed attempt.

I tried to stop iptables, didn't help.

I tried several tricks I could find online with my /etc/ssh/ssh_config, but I was unsuccessful in solving the problem...

Any ideas?



Edit:
This is the log from one of the hosts I try to connect to:

Assistant: That's a tough-to-debug one in openssh, It seems to happen only from particular clients to particular servers. 


Cause?
I didn't get to the root cause. My best finding is that the connection packets are too big for the server to handle, and the connection is reset.
Workarounds: limit the packet size. Two alternatives:


Limit cipher list length by using '-c ' in the ssh command line, e.g. '-c aes256-ctr'
Limit HostKeyAlgorithms list by adding to ~/.ssh/config:


  HostKeyAlgorithms       ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-dss-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-rsa-cert-v00@openssh.com,ssh-dss-cert-v00@openssh.com,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-rsa,ssh-dss

Affected versions:
AFAIK it started with 5.7p1. Downgrading to 5.5p1 solves the problem. However, on machines that do NOT have this problem, 5.7p1, 5.8p1 work perfectly.
Thus my assumption is that it has to do with an innocent library call that was added on 5.7p1 to a 3rd party lib, which is broken only on certain environments. Crazy assumption to a crazy bug.
