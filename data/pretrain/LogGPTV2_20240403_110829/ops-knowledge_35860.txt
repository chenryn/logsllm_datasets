### SSH Client Problem: Connection Reset by Peer

I'm experiencing a frustrating issue on my Ubuntu laptop, which I first noticed after upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04. However, I'm not entirely sure if the upgrade is the cause, as I also modified my SSH keys a few days ago.

#### Issue Description
Whenever I attempt to SSH into any host, I receive the following error:

```
Read from socket failed: Connection reset by peer
```

Running `ssh` with `-vvv` provides the following detailed output:

```
OpenSSH_5.8p1 Debian-1ubuntu3, OpenSSL 0.9.8o 01 Jun 2010

debug3: load_hostkeys: loaded 0 keys

```

#### Configuration
My `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file contains the following settings:

```
Host *
    SendEnv LANG LC_*
    HashKnownHosts yes
    GSSAPIAuthentication no
    GSSAPIDelegateCredentials no
```

#### Troubleshooting Steps
- I can successfully connect to my laptop from other servers via SSH.
- I can also SSH into `localhost` from my laptop without issues.
- I can connect to all these servers from other laptops.
- There are no relevant logs on the target servers regarding my failed attempts.
- Disabling `iptables` did not resolve the issue.
- I have tried various configurations and tricks found online, but none have solved the problem.

#### Server Log
Here is the log from one of the hosts I am trying to connect to:

```

### Potential Cause and Workarounds
This issue seems to occur only between specific clients and servers. My best guess is that the connection packets are too large for the server to handle, leading to a connection reset.

#### Workarounds:
1. **Limit Cipher List Length**:
   Use the `-c` option in the `ssh` command to limit the cipher list. For example:
   ```sh
   ssh -c aes256-ctr user@hostname
   ```

2. **Limit HostKeyAlgorithms List**:
   Add the following to your `~/.ssh/config` file:
   ```sh
   HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-dss-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-rsa-cert-v00@openssh.com,ssh-dss-cert-v00@openssh.com,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
   ```

#### Affected Versions
- The issue appears to have started with OpenSSH 5.7p1. Downgrading to 5.5p1 resolves the problem.
- On machines that do not experience this issue, versions 5.7p1 and 5.8p1 work perfectly.
- This suggests that the problem might be related to an innocuous library call added in 5.7p1, which is broken in certain environments.
