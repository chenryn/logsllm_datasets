ATT&CK ID:T1036.008
ATT&CK Technique Name:Masquerade File Type
Adversaries may masquerade malicious payloads as legitimate files through changes to the payload's formatting, including the file’s signature, extension, and contents. Various file types have a typical standard format, including how they are encoded and organized. For example, a file’s signature (also known as header or magic bytes) is the beginning bytes of a file and is often used to identify the file’s type. For example, the header of a JPEG file,  is  0xFF 0xD8 and the file extension is either .JPE, .JPEG or .JPG.
