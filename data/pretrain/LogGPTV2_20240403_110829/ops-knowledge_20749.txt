User: I am running a Python script which downloads PDF files from the FTP. The script when run manually works perfectly but when i put it in crontab in my ubuntu machine and execute it i get a an error [Errno 32] Broken pipe. Any idea why this happens and how do i handle this?
Assistant: Hi I dnt know y the error occurs but when i directed the print statements from my script to another file this error did not come and my script ran successfully 
Example: Myscript.py > test.log
