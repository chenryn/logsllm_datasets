Pull Request #20983 includes the porting of CUDA Blas functions `gemm` and `gemv` to ATen native. However, there are several other Blas functions in `THCBlas.{h,cu}` that still need to be ported.

Additionally, the duplication of the following functions needs to be addressed:
- `adjustLdLevel2`
- `adjustLdLevel3`
- `convertTransToCublasOperation`
- `THCublasCheck`

These duplicated functions should be removed once all the functions in `THCBlas.cu` have been updated to use the Blas functions from `at::cuda::blas`.

This will ensure a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
