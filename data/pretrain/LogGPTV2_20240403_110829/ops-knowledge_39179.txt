Question: "Why does the implementation of file-based encryption (FBE) in Android devices use hardware-wrapped keys instead of solely relying on the keyslots of an inline crypto engine?"
 "A": "The number of keyslots in an inline crypto engine is limited, and it cannot be used for tasks such as filenames encryption or deriving key identifiers."
 "B": "Inline crypto engines are not capable of encrypting/decrypting full blocks of data on-disk."
 "C": "Hardware-wrapped keys are less secure than keyslots in inline crypto engines but are easier to implement."
 "D": "The inline crypto engine requires the raw encryption keys to be saved on the disk, which is a security risk."
Answer: A
