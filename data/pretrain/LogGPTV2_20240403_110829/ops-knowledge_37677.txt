User:  user has successfully installed a specific version of Python on their computer, but is having trouble using a virtual environment. Please provide a simple solution.
Assistant: Make sure the virtual environment is installed and activated. Then use the command-line tools in the virtual environment to run the Python script instead of running it directly in the computer environment. For example, if you are using a Windows operating system and the virtual environment name is env, you can activate the virtual environment with the following command in a command line window: C:\Users\username\project> env\Scripts\activate.bat Then, You can use the "python" command to start the Python interpreter in the virtual environment: (env) C:\Users\username\project> python Now you can run your Python scripts in the virtual environment without interfering with the computer environment Python installation. To exit the virtual environment, use the following command: (env) C:\Users\username\project> deactivate
