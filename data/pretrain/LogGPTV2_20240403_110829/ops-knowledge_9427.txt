The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: mod_jk child workerEnv in error state <*> 和 jk2_init() Found child <*> in scoreboard slot <*>
B: jk2_init() Found child <*> in scoreboard slot <*> 和 jk2_init() Can't find child <*> in scoreboard
C: [client <*>] Directory index forbidden by rule: <*> 和 workerEnv.init() ok <*>
D: jk2_init() Found child <*> in scoreboard slot <*> 和 mod_jk child init <*> <*>

Assistant: Answer: C
