When the while loop is infinite (say by not incrementing the iterator), the
error is not surfaced, and the last test does not appear.The current behavior
does not indicate that there is a problem with the code; the experience just
breaks silently.
This may be expected behavior, as the infinite evaluation will preclude the
second test running, but there may be a more elegant way to surface this
issue. Let me know how best to follow up on this, or if it is duplicated
elsewhere.

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    var myArray = [];
    var i = 0;
    // Only change code below this line.
    while (i < 5){
      myArray.push(i);
    }
    // Only change code above this line.
    if(typeof(myArray) !== "undefined"){(function(){return myArray;})();}
