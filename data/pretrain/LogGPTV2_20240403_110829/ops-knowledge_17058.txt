User: How do i find out the intersection of 2 files in windows? 
TextFile A: 100GB
TextFile B: 10MB
All i can think of is using python
I would read the lines in textfile B into memory in python and compare with each line in text file A.
I was wondering if there is any way to do it via the command prompt in linux/windows.
Assistant: If repetition doesn't matter, then this command will do it:
sort <(sort file1 | uniq) <(sort file2 | uniq) | uniq -d
