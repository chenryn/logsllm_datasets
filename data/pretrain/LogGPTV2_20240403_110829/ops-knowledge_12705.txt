It seems like you are encountering an issue with installing and running Orbited. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the problem:

1. **Download Orbited**: You have already downloaded Orbited from [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/orbited/0.7.10).

2. **Navigate to the Download Directory**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Orbited files. For example:
     ```sh
     cd /path/to/downloaded/files
     ```

3. **Install Orbited**:
   - Ensure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system.
   - Run the following command to install Orbited:
     ```sh
     pip install .
     ```
   - This command installs the package from the current directory.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - After installation, you can verify that Orbited is installed correctly by checking if it is available in your Python environment:
     ```sh
     pip show orbited
     ```

5. **Run Orbited**:
   - If the installation was successful, you should be able to run Orbited using the following command:
     ```sh
     orbited
     ```
   - If you still encounter the "command not found" error, it might be due to the executable not being in your system's PATH. You can add the path to the executable manually or use the full path to the `orbited` script.

6. **Check for Errors**:
   - If you continue to experience issues, please provide any error messages you receive, and I can assist you further.
