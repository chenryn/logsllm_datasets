## Abstract
Botnets are frequently employed in attacks on financial services. Banks and security firms invest significant resources in detecting and mitigating malware-assisted account takeovers. A critical component of these botnets is their command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure, which attackers often rent or compromise. Hosting providers regularly take down C&C servers, but the effectiveness of this strategy depends on understanding how attackers choose their hosting providers. For instance, do they prefer providers who are slow or reluctant to take down C&Cs? This paper analyzes seven years of data on C&C servers used in attacks on financial services. Our goal is to determine whether attackers have a preference for certain types of providers or if their C&Cs are randomly distributed across the hosting industry. We extract structural properties of providers to model the distribution of C&Cs.

We find that the size of the provider explains approximately 71% of the variance in the number of C&Cs per provider, while the rule of law in the country only explains about 1%. Additionally, we observe that price, time in business, popularity, and the ratio of vulnerable websites significantly correlate with C&C counts. Surprisingly, the speed at which providers take down C&C domains has only a weak relationship with C&C occurrence rates, adding only 1% to the explained variance. This suggests that attackers do not strongly prefer providers who allow long-lived C&Cs.

## 1. Introduction
Research into botnet disruption has primarily focused on two strategies: comprehensive takedown efforts of the C&C infrastructure and the cleanup of infected end-user machines (bots). The first strategy aims to remove control from botmasters, while the second is a war of attrition, removing malware one machine at a time. Despite some success, infection levels remain stable in many countries.

A third, less-studied strategy involves hosting providers taking down C&C servers. To enhance this strategy, it is crucial to understand how attackers distribute their C&C domains. Do they randomly distribute them, or do they prefer specific providers, perhaps those with lax security practices or those offering bulletproof services?

This paper investigates the placement strategies of C&C servers across the hosting market, focusing on botnets that target financial services, such as Zeus, Citadel, and Dyre. We analyze seven years of data on 26 botnet families to determine if attackers have a preference for certain types of providers or if C&Cs are randomly distributed.

## 2. Data Collection Methodology
To understand the attacker's strategy for placing C&C servers, we use two datasets: C&C domain data and hosting provider data.

### 2.1 Command-and-Control Data
We focus on C&Cs of botnets involved in attacks on financial services. Our datasets include:

- **ZeusTracker**: Provided by Roman Huessy, this dataset contains metadata on C&C servers for the ZeuS malware family from 2009 to 2016.
- **Private Honeypots**: Captured by a security company specializing in threat intelligence for banks, this dataset includes C&C domains from various botnets, collected over one year (2015Q1-2016Q1) using live malware samples and honeypots.

The combined dataset contains 11,544 unique domain names associated with 8,528 IP addresses. Table 1 provides a summary of our C&C data.

| Year | # Domains | IP Addresses | Families |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 2009 | 934       | 771          | 1        |
| 2010 | 1016      | 806          | 1        |
| 2011 | 1071      | 638          | 1        |
| 2012 | 1189      | 922          | 4        |
| 2013 | 1761      | 1365         | 3        |
| 2014 | 2188      | 1768         | 4        |
| 2015 | 3897      | 1819         | 28       |
| 2016 | 3718      | 969          | 34       |

### 2.2 Hosting Provider Data
To attribute C&Cs to their responsible service providers, we use WHOIS data to identify the organizations to which IP addresses are allocated. We start with IP addresses and domain names from DNSDB, a passive DNS database provided by Farsight Security. We map these to their corresponding organizations using WHOIS data from the MaxMind database. After filtering out non-hosting organizations, we end up with 45,358 hosting providers.

## 3. Characterizing C&C Concentrations
Using our datasets, we examine the distribution of C&C domains across different hosting providers to gain insights into attacker placement strategies.

### 3.1 Descriptive Summary of C&C Domains
Figure 1 shows the distribution and evolution of financial malware families over the years. Zeus was the main financial malware between 2009 and 2012, followed by the emergence of related families like Citadel and Ice-IX, and later, other families like Dyre, Cryptowall, and Avzhan.

### 3.2 Concentration of C&Cs across Providers
Figure 3 depicts the number of providers hosting C&C domains over time. We observe a general increase in the total number of providers, with a high entrance and exit rate, suggesting that attackers' choices are highly dynamic.

### 3.3 Geography of Providers Hosting C&C Domains
Figure 5 shows the geographical distribution of C&Cs and their hosting providers. Most C&C domains in the top-20 most abused hosting providers are located in the US and Western Europe, with a few exceptions like Confluence Networks and SoftLayer Technologies.

## 4. Statistical Model of C&C Concentrations
We build a statistical model to understand why C&C domains are concentrated in certain providers. We define explanatory variables that capture structural characteristics of providers and their security efforts. We find that the size of the provider explains 71% of the variance in C&C counts, while the rule of law in the country only explains 1%. Business model characteristics such as pricing, popularity, time in business, and the ratio of vulnerable websites also significantly impact C&C concentrations. The speed of C&C takedown has only a weak relationship with C&C occurrence rates, suggesting that attackers do not strongly prefer providers who allow long-lived C&Cs.

## 5. Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the distribution of C&C domains is largely random, with the size of the provider being the primary factor. Future work could explore additional factors and refine the model to further improve mitigation strategies.

## 6. Related Work
We compare our findings with existing research on botnet takedown and hosting provider behavior.

## 7. Limitations
We discuss the limitations of our study, including potential biases in the datasets and the need for more granular data on provider characteristics.
