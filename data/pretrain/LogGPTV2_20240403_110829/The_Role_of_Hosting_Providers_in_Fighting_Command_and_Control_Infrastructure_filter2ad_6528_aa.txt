ABSTRACT
A variety of botnets are used in attacks on ﬁnancial ser-
vices. Banks and security ﬁrms invest a lot of eﬀort in
detecting and combating malware-assisted takeover of cus-
tomer accounts. A critical resource of these botnets is their
command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure. Attackers rent
or compromise servers to operate their C&C infrastructure.
Hosting providers routinely take down C&C servers, but the
eﬀectiveness of this mitigation strategy depends on under-
standing how attackers select the hosting providers to host
their servers. Do they prefer, for example, providers who
are slow or unwilling in taking down C&Cs? In this paper,
we analyze 7 years of data on the C&C servers of botnets
that have engaged in attacks on ﬁnancial services. Our aim
is to understand whether attackers prefer certain types of
providers or whether their C&Cs are randomly distributed
across the whole attack surface of the hosting industry. We
extract a set of structural properties of providers to capture
the attack surface.
We model the distribution of C&Cs across providers and
show that the mere size of the provider can explain around
71% of the variance in the number of C&Cs per provider,
whereas the rule of law in the country only explains around
1%. We further observe that price, time in business, popu-
larity and ratio of vulnerable websites of providers relate sig-
niﬁcantly with C&C counts. Finally, we ﬁnd that the speed
with which providers take down C&C domains has only a
weak relation with C&C occurrence rates, adding only 1%
explained variance. This suggests attackers have little to
no preference for providers who allow long-lived C&C do-
mains.

command and control (C&C) infrastructure and the cleanup
process of the infected end user machines (bots) [12,32,43].
The ﬁrst strategy has the promise of being the most eﬀec-
tive, taking away control of the botnet from the botmasters.
In reality, however, this is often not possible. The second
strategy is not about striking a fatal blow, but about the
war of attrition to remove malware, one machine at a time.
It has not been without success, however. Infection levels
have been stable in many countries [5].
In practice, a third strategy is also being pursued. Similar
to access providers cleaning up end user machines, there is
a persistent eﬀort by hosting providers to take down C&C
servers, one at a time. This line of mitigation has been
studied much less, perhaps because most botnets have been
resilient to these eﬀorts.
Could this strategy be made more eﬀective? This de-
pends on how attackers distribute their C&C domains. Do
they randomly distribute them over many hosting providers?
Or do they locate them predominantly in carefully selected
providers, perhaps those who are negligent in terms of abuse
handling or who oﬀer bullet-proof services to actively sup-
port criminal activities [18,22,40]. Depending on the answer,
there are diﬀerent directions for improving mitigation.
This paper sets out to discover the strategies of attackers
for the placement of their C&C servers across the hosting
market. We focus on botnet families that have, in varying
degrees, been used to attack ﬁnancial services. Well-known
examples are Zeus, Citadel and Dyre. These are widely un-
derstood to be among the most harmful botnets. Industry
association M3AAWG has listed them as a top priority for
abuse handling by providers [28]. This means that if provi-
ders do anything in terms of mitigation, it would be most
visible for these botnet families. Put diﬀerently, if attackers
care about the security practices of providers, we should see
it ﬁrst and foremost in the location of the C&C for these
botnets.
Do attackers prefer providers with little or no abuse han-
dling? Or are the C&C domains more or less randomly
distributed across the overall attack surface of the hosting
market? We study seven years of data on the location of
C&Cs for 26 botnet families engaged in attacks against ﬁ-
nancial services.
We model the distribution of C&C domains across the
overall landscape of the hosting market. Using several datasets
for approximating the size and attack surface of providers,
we can quantify the extent to which the number of C&C
domains per provider can be explained as the outcome of a
random selection process by attackers. We then analyze
575whether there is a relation between the concentration of
C&C in providers and the speed with which providers take
down such domains.
Our contributions are as follows:
• We track the trends in the hosting locations of C&C for
26 diﬀerent malware families that, to varying degrees,
have been used in attacks on ﬁnancial services. We ﬁnd
that, over time, C&Cs domains are spread out over
more providers, diluting the concentrations of C&C;
• We model the distribution of C&Cs across providers
and show that the mere size of the provider can explain
around 71% of the variance in the number of C&Cs
per provider, whereas the rule of law in the country
only explains around 1%, suggesting a predominantly
random selection process by the attackers for locating
their C&C;
• Using a sample of hosting providers, we show that busi-
ness model characteristics – such as pricing, popularity,
time in business and the ratio of WordPress websites
– all have a signiﬁcant impact on the concentration of
C&C domains;
• We demonstrate that there are statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences among providers in C&C takedown speed.
Despite such diﬀerences, the take-down speed only has
a weak relation with the concentration of C&Cs across
providers, suggesting that attackers have little or no
preference for hosting their domains in hosting provi-
ders that allow longer C&C uptime;
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 describes our data collection methodology. Section 3
provides a descriptive summary of our datasets and studies
the concentrations of C&Cs in terms of malware and hosting
types and across diﬀerent geo-locations. Section 4 outlines
a set of variables that capture diﬀerent aspects of provider
s’ characteristics and next use them to model the C&C con-
centrations across providers. In this section we discuss our
modeling approach and results at length. We then extend
our model in Section 5 with taking the eﬀect of provider
take-down speed of C&C domains into account. Our ﬁnding
are compared to the related work in Section 6. Finally, we
discuss the main conclusions and limitations of our work in
Section 7.
2. DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY
To understand the attacker’s strategy for the placement
of their C&C servers across the hosting market, we employ
two types datasets: (i) data on C&C domains; and (ii) data
on hosting providers. We ﬁrst provide an overview of these
datasets.
2.1 Command-and-Control Data
As stated earlier, we focus on C&Cs of botnets engaged,
to varying degrees, in attacks on ﬁnancial services. We make
use of two datasets which in conjunction provide information
on C&C domains located in 109 countries:
ZeusTracker: Provided by Roman Huessy from Zeus-
Tracker [6], is a C&C panel tracker that contains meta
data on C&C servers online at any point of time be-
tween 2009 and 2016 for the ZeuS malware family.
Private honeypots: Captured by a security com-
pany specialized in threat intelligence for banks and
ﬁnancial institutions using honeypots located all over
the world, this dataset contains a list of botnet C&C
domains from various botnets. Some of those botnets
are predominantly used for attacks on ﬁnancial ser-
vices, like Citadel. Others are more generic malware
families, but the security company has observed them
as participating in attacks on ﬁnancial services. The
data is collected over a period of one year (2015Q1-
2016Q1) using two methods: by running live malware
samples and using honeypots.
The combined dataset contains 11,544 unique domain names
associated with 8,528 IP addresses. A more detailed sum-
mary of our C&C data is shown in Table 1.

2.2 Hosting Provider Data
The next steps towards studying the location of C&Cs
is to attribute them to their responsible service providers.
To that end, we need to reliably identify hosting providers.
Most of the existing work towards identifying hosting provi-
ders use BGP routing data to map IP addresses to their re-
spective Autonomous Systems (ASes). This approach essen-
tially equates ASes with hosting providers. However, ASes
do not perfectly correspond to hosting providers. The same
AS can contain multiple providers and, reverse, the same
provider can operate multiple ASes. We deﬁne providers as
the entities that own the IP addresses in question, rather
than the entities that route traﬃc to and from it. This is
more fully explored in prior work [9, 39]. We use WHOIS data
to identify the organizations to which IP addresses are allo-
cated.
Our starting point is the IP addresses and domain names
in DNSDB, a passive DNS database that draws upon hun-
dreds of sensors worldwide and generously provided to us
by Farsight Security [1, 2]. We use passive DNS data to
populate a global list of domain names and IP addresses
used for web hosting. To our knowledge, DNSDB has the
highest coverage of the domain name space available to re-
searchers. We map the IP addresses and domains in passive
DNS data to their corresponding organizations using WHOIS
data from the MaxMind database [3, 26]. Next, by adopting
some of the keywords and categories adopted from the pre-
vious work [14, 39], we ﬁlter out non-hosting organizations
(e.g., educational and governmental). The ﬁnal set consists
of 45,358 hosting providers, representing the population of
hosting services from all over the world. A more detailed
description of this method is discussed in [39].

TIONS
Given our C&C and hosting provider datasets, we can
examine the distribution of C&C domains across diﬀerent
hosting providers to gain insight into attacker C&C place-
ment strategies. Do they prefer certain hosting providers?
Do they prefer certain locations? In this section, we pro-
vide a descriptive summary of our data and examine such
diﬀerent aspects of C&C concentration.
further highlights the importance of measures taken by pro-
viders to protect the machines they are hosting from getting
compromised.
3.2 Concentration of C&Cs across Providers
Next, we examine the trends in concentration of C&C
domains across providers, to examine if C&C domains are
mostly concentrated in speciﬁc hosting providers. This could
help us to gain a better understanding of attacker prefer-
ences.

C&Cs
3.1 Descriptive Summary of C&C Domains
Figure 1 displays the distribution and evolution of the ﬁ-
nancial malware families over years, given the ﬁrst time a
malware is seen in our data. The trend indicates the pres-
ence of Zeus as the main ﬁnancial malware between 2009
and 2012. Starting from 2012, we observe the emergence of
ZeuS-related families such as Citadel and Ice-IX and grad-
ually other malware families such as Dyre, Cryptowall and
Avzhan.
The portion of our C&C data that comes from ZeusTracker
also includes information on the type of hosting for some of
the C&C domains. The information about the hosting type
is gathered by ZeusTracker based on manual analysis of a
sample of C&Cs.
Figure 3 depicts the number of providers hosting C&C do-
mains over time. The green line indicates the total number
of providers hosting C&C domains in a given year. The blue
line indicates the amount of newly observed providers host-
ing C&C domains for a speciﬁc year while the red line depicts
providers that were no longer hosting C&Cs in comparison
to the previous year. It should be noted that the removal of
a hosting provider is not necessarily due to clean-up eﬀorts,
but could be the consequence of attackers’ choices. The plot
gives a better sense of the total number of hosting providers
that are linked with hosting C&C domains.
Over time, we observe a general increase in the total num-
ber of providers. At the same time, the number of newly
added and removed providers follow a similar upward trend
which points to a relatively high entrance and exit rate of
providers. The pattern also indicates that an attacker’s
choice of provider is highly dynamic and shifts from provider
to provider over time.
Figure 2: Distribution of malware families over years
Figure 2 shows the distribution of these types over the
measurement period. Since the hosting types are known
only for a minority of the domains, it is not easy to make any
substantive conclusions from the exact numbers. However,
the plot suggests that the majority of C&Cs with known
types are located on compromised servers, followed by a mi-
nority located at free or bulletproof hosting providers. This
Figure 4: Cumulative percentage of C&C domains
for the percentage of hosting providers
Figure 4 displays the cumulative percentage of C&C do-
mains against the percentage of hosting providers. The blue
line in the plot follows a power-law distribution: a large
577number of C&C domains are concentrated in a small num-
ber of hosting providers, 80% of C&Cs are located in less
than 30% of the hosting providers. This shows a clear con-
centration of C&C infrastructure. While the majority of
C&Cs are hosted by a minority of providers, it is still un-
clear whether this concentration in caused by an attacker’s
preference to choose lax hosting providers in terms of secu-
rity, or whether it is just an artifact of a provider’s size and
business model and therefore is randomly distributed. We
further examine this question via modeling various provider
characteristics in section 4.
3.3 Geography of Providers Hosting C&C Do-
mains
We also examine the geographical distribution of the C&Cs
and the providers who host them. Hosting providers operate
from various jurisdiction and therefore speciﬁc geographical
parts of their business could be prone to more abuse due to
factors such as weak rule of law or enforcement institutions.
We map the C&C server to their geo-location using the
MaxMind GeoIP API [3]. While the C&Cs in our data are
located in 109 various countries around the globe, ﬁgure 5
suggests that the majority of C&C domains in the top-20
most abused hosting providers are located in US and west-
ern Europe. There are a few exceptions such as Confluence
Networks that seem to operate in part from the Virgin Is-
lands and SoftLayer Technologies that hosts domains in
Panama.

20 providers hosting C&Cs
4. STATISTICAL MODEL OF C&C CON-
CENTRATIONS
As we explained earlier, we aim to have a better un-
derstanding of why C&C domains are concentrated in cer-
tain providers through building a statistical model that ex-
plains C&C counts from provider characteristics. In previ-
ous work, we proposed an approach to study phishing abuse
counts across hosting providers using regression models that
carefully decomposes diﬀerent sources of variance in abuse
counts for diﬀerent characteristics [38]. Our current goal is
to see whether we see similar patterns in attacker prefer-
ences for hosting C&C infrastructure. Contrary to phishing
sites, one might expect C&C to be more selectively located.
We deﬁne a set of explanatory variables that capture struc-
tural characteristics of providers and their security eﬀort, as
deﬁned in previous work [38]. In this section we study the
