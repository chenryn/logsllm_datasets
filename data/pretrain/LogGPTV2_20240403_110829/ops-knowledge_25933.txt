Question: A security analyst is testing a web application and notices that when a query string parameter is repeated with different values, the application seems to concatenate the values with a comma. The analyst suspects that the web application backend could be vulnerable to HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP). Which of the following actions should the analyst take to confirm the vulnerability?
"A": "Submit a single parameter with a long string of random characters to test for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.",
"B": "Append the same parameter with a different value and analyze the response to determine how the values are parsed.",
"C": "Use an intercepting proxy to remove all query string parameters and observe if the application defaults to hidden parameters.",
"D": "Disable JavaScript in the browser to test if the parameter pollution is a result of client-side scripting."
Answer: B
