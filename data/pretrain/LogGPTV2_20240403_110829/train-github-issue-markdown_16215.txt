## Expected Behavior
The SW-Precache demo should precache all .next folder's ressources?
## Current Behavior
The SW-Precache demo cache nothing.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Go in the demo's folder **with-sw-precache**
  3. Run `npm build`
  4. The result is:
    Using "webpack" config function defined in next.config.js.
    Total precache size is about 0 B for 0 resources.
## Context
I would like to use sw-precache with NextJS
