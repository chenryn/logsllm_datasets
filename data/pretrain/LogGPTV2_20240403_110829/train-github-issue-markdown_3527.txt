Repro Steps:
    kubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yaml 
    deployment "nginx-deployment" created
    kubectl get deployments
    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx-deployment   3         3         3            3           0s
    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
    deployments "nginx-deployment":
    REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
    1               
Note: `CHANGE-CAUSE` has value ``, since deployment file did not contain
any annotations.
Modify nginx-deployment.yaml file adding annotation `foo-bar` like so:
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/change-cause: foo-bar
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.7.9
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
Delete nginx-desployment and re-create one from scratch
    kubectl delete deployment/nginx-deployment
    deployment "nginx-deployment" deleted
Assert deployment is gone:
     kubectl get deployments
Create new nginx-deployment:
    kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml 
    deployment "nginx-deployment" created
    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
    deployments "nginx-deployment":
    REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
    1               kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
Note: `CHANGE-CAUSE` reflect the actual command and not the value from the
file
Apply the same change again:
    kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml 
    deployment "nginx-deployment" configured
    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
    deployments "nginx-deployment":
    REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
    1               foo-bar
Note: second time around annotation is correctly updated. Since there were no
other changes to the deployment, no new pods/replicasets were created.
Repeat applying the same deployment file and observe alternating value in
`CHANGE-CAUSE`
    kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml 
    deployment "nginx-deployment" configured
    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
    deployments "nginx-deployment":
    REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
    1               kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml 
    deployment "nginx-deployment" configured
    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
    deployments "nginx-deployment":
    REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
    1               foo-bar
