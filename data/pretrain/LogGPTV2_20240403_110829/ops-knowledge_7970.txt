User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Prevent one user from disconnecting an active remote desktop session I've got a server where a number of users are sharing user logins for a short period of time to prevent too many people from logging in at the same time. 

The users are connecting over remote desktop, but the problem is that when one user is busy doing something, another user logs in as the same user and disconnects the active session. 

Is there any way of preventing one user from logging in and disconnecting the same username who is already connected to somewhere else?

This is on Windows Server 2008 R2

The reason for limitation is the hardware will only support a small number of users. New hardware has been ordered, but users need to use the system until the new one is available.

Assistant: I don't know of any way to do this natively. Windows doesn't know that there are 2 human beings using the same user account.
