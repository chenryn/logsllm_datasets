Abstract—Designing reliable
systems using scaled Spin-
Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) has be-
come a signiﬁcant challenge as the memory technology feature
size is scaled down. The introduction of a more prominent read
disturbance is a key contributor in this reliability challenge. How-
ever, techniques to address read disturbance are often considered
in a vacuum that assumes other concerns like transient read
errors (false reads) and write faults do not occur.
This paper studies several techniques that leverage ECC to
mitigate persistent errors resulting from read disturbance and
write faults of STT-RAM while still considering the impact of
transient errors of false reads. In particular, we study three
policies to enable better-than-conservative read disturbance mit-
igation. The ﬁrst policy, write after error (WAE), uses ECC to
detect errors and write back data to clear persistent errors. The
second policy, write after persistent error (WAP), ﬁlters out false
reads by reading a second time when an error is detected leading
to trade-off between write and read energy. The third policy,
write after error threshold (WAT), leaves cells with incorrect
data behind (up to a threshold) when the number of errors is
less than the ECC capability.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the different schemes and
compare with the simple previously proposed scheme of writing
after every read (WAR), we model these policies using Markov
processes. This approach allows the determination of appropriate
bit error rates in the context of both persistent and transient
errors to accurately estimate the system reliability and the
energy consumption of different error correction approaches.
Our evaluations show that each of these policies provides beneﬁts
for different error scenarios. Moreover some approaches can
save energy by an average of 99.5%, while incurring the same
reliability as other approaches.

I. INTRODUCTION
As the number of cores per chip continues to increase, the
need for a large memory capacity that serves the requests of
the executing cores is pressing more than ever. Nevertheless,
DRAM is plagued by physical limitations putting its scalability
and reliability into jeopardy. Accordingly, alternative memory
technologies that can either replace or augment DRAM needs
to be considered in order to build a large and reliable memory
system [1–6].
Among many candidates, Spin-Transfer Torque Random
Access Memory (STT-RAM) is emerging as a promising
technology due to its desirable characteristics in terms of
scalability, low access latency, non-volatility and negligible
stand-by power. Data is stored in STT-RAM as the resistance
state of magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ). Applying a spin-
polarized current switches the MTJ resistance between a high
and low resistance states. Yet, a major obstacle precluding the

integration of STT-RAM into the memory stack is its relatively
unreliable reads and writes.
The user operations in STT-RAM suffer from three types
of errors resulting from: (1) read disturbances, (2) false reads,
(3) write faults. A read disturbance accidentally ﬂips the value
stored within a cell resulting in subsequent read errors that
persist until a new value is written into the cell. Likewise, a
write fault stores the wrong data into a cell and can only be
corrected by rewriting. A false read erroneously reads a cell
producing a value different from the stored one.
Note, however, that read disturbances are latent. That is,
a read operation that disturbs a cell correctly retrieves the
value stored within that cell but every subsequent read suffers
from an error due to the disturbed cell. Although the raw bit
error rate (RBER) of read disturbances is relatively low, the
persistent nature of the resulting errors requires special atten-
tion. In fact, the effect of read disturbances is ampliﬁed with
repeated read operations [3, 7, 8]. For example, Fig. 1 shows
the probability of an error resulting from read disturbance in
a 512-bit STT-RAM block as the number of read operation
increases. The plot reveals that as the number of reads to a
block increases, the probability of errors resulting from read
disturbance increases. Hence, mitigating destructive errors is
a priority to improve the reliability of the system.
The problem of read disturbance can be dealt with through
writing back data after every read operation (WAR) [7]. A
write back mitigates disturbances, as the read data is correct
due to the latent nature of errors. This approach makes the
pessimistic assumption that reads are always destructive and
mitigates read disturbances after every read operation. Clearly,
this incurs an unnecessarily large overhead, as it is unlikely for
every read operation to induce a disturbance. In practice, an
error correcting code (ECC) needs to be deployed to recover

from transient errors (false reads). As a matter of fact, the
deployed ECC can detect latent read disturbances, as it does
not differentiate between the persistent error and transient
error. In this paper, we rely on the error detection capability
of the ECC to mitigate the read disturbances in addition to
mitigating false reads and write faults. Essentially, any error
detected (and corrected) by the ECC is treated as a potential
read disturbance. Subsequently, either the data is written back
or a second read is used to discover the nature of the error.
Thus, a memory block is refreshed on demand upon error
detection.
Delaying the refresh of a block with disturbed cells until an
error is detected risks violating the premise of the achievable
uncorrectable bit error rate (UBER) with the deployed ECC.
Given the latent nature of read disturbances, the ECC deployed
initially to recover from transient errors is presumed to detect
and correct read disturbances as well. However, the combined
transient and persistent RBER may increase so that the ca-
pability of the ECC is short of attaining a desired UBER.
Nevertheless, the likelihood of such an event is low, as it
requires both a persistent error and a transient error to strike
together. We resort to Markov Chains to reason about the
combined effect of persistent and transient errors on the UBER
when on demand refresh is used to deal with read disturbance.
Accordingly, we investigate three policies which refresh the
memory block on demand: Write back After Error detection
(WAE),Write back After Persistent error detection (WAP) and
Write back After error Threshold (WAT).
Based on our analysis of how errors manifest in STT-RAM,
this paper reaches two conclusions: The ﬁrst is that on demand
refresh-based policies do not sacriﬁce reliability and maintains
an UBER that is within the desired range. Moreover, WAE and
WAP decrease the energy consumption by 99.5% compared
to the WAR approach. The second is that when the read
disturbance rate is lower than the write fault and false read
error rates, WAT decreases the energy consumption compared
to WAE and WAP while retaining a speciﬁed reliability. In
summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
• It uses Markov chains to reason about the reliability of a
system considering read disturbances, write faults and false
reads together and shows how an ECC can be used to cover
the three different types of errors.
• It revisits the “Write after every Read” technique in the pres-
ence of write faults and shows that when the write error rate
is comparable to the read error rate, both the reliability and
the performance of this technique signiﬁcantly decreases.
• It investigates three different on-demand refresh policies to
recover from the persistent effect of read disturbances and
write faults.
• It characterizes reliability and energy consumption of the
different policies across different ranges of raw bit error
rates.
A. STT-RAM
Fig. 2a shows a cell structure of an STT-RAM composed of
a Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ) connected in series with
a transistor. This cell is connected between the bit lines and the
source lines whereas the word line is responsible for switching
off the transistor. A MTJ device consists of a reference (ﬁxed)
layer and a free layer, which are separated by an oxide barrier
layer [9]. When the current ﬂows from the free layer to the
reference layer, the magnetization direction of the free layer
ﬂips to be parallel to that of the reference layer and the
MTJ resistance becomes low representing a logical ‘0’; On
the contrary, when the current is applied from the reference
layer to the free layer, the magnetization direction of the free
layer ﬂips to be anti-parallel to that of the reference layer
as shown in Fig. 2b. In this case, the MTJ resistance is high
representing a logical ‘1’.
To write the data to the MTJ, a large current is injected so
as to change the magnetic orientation of the free layer. The
amount of the required current for writing into the MTJ is
signiﬁcantly larger than that for reading it. The read current
can be injected into two different directions, but the direction
of writing ‘0’ is always picked to increase reliability [10].
The read current ﬂowing in this direction potentially induces
a unidirectional ‘1 → 0’ ﬂip.
B. Errors in read and write operations
In STT-RAM, write faults occur when the current is re-
moved before the MTJ switching process completes [11, 12].
False reads in STT-RAM are mainly caused by a decrease in
the Tunnel Magneto-Resistance (TMR) ratio, and an increase
in process variations in deep sub-micron technologies. If the
current of parallel (anti-parallel) state in the MTJ crosses the
threshold value of the anti-parallel (parallel) state, then the
read returns a value different than the value stored within
an MTJ resulting in a false read. Read disturbance is mainly
caused by the limited thermal stability and accumulated read
current pulses. When a large current during read is applied, the
read disturbance accidentally ﬂips the value stored within an
MTJ cell resulting in an error that persists in subsequent reads
until the cell is rewritten. The probability of a read disturbance
(RBER) of an MTJ at a read current, Ir, is determined by the
read current pulse width, τ, the thermal stability, Δ, and the
critical switching current, I0, as follows [1, 13]:

where, τ0 denotes the thermally activated reversal time. Since
the fabrication process determines the MTJ device parameters
such as Ic0 and Δ, they remain unchanged after a device is
made. Therefore, the read disturbance probability is a function
of Ir
I0 , under a given τ. Note that false reads are related
MTJ thickness and TMR while disturbance and write errors
derive from current densities [11, 14], so they are not tightly
correlated.
In this paper, we will denote the RBER due to false
reads, read disturbances and write faults by pf , pd and pw,
respectively. Amongst false reads, read disturbances and write
faults, only the effect of read disturbance is magniﬁed with
repeated read operations. Accordingly, the persistent nature
of read disturbance requires special attention. Note that read
disturbance errors in STT-RAM are local, so they differ from
crosstalk in ﬂash memory and DRAM [15–18]. For 180nm
CMOS technology, the amplitude of the read current is much
smaller than that of the write current and therefore read
operations are reliable. Since CMOS technology continues to
scale down, the amplitude of the read current and the write
current are so close for 32nm technology which dramatically
increase the susceptibility of cells to read disturbance.
C. Related work
To tackle the read disturbance problem, several techniques
have been proposed. A circuit based technique has been
proposed for STT-RAM in which a pulsed read technique is
used to read the content of the bit-cell [19]. In this technique,
the word line switches to low and high states for a certain
period of time to form a pulse that prevents the read current
from ﬂowing continuously through the bit-cell. Although this
reduces the read disturbance rate, it increases read access time
and the complexity of the sensing technique. At a device level,
a disruptive reading and restoring scheme has been proposed
in [20] to reduce the read disturbance rate by increasing the
thermal stability factor. However, this considerably increases
the overall cycle time, the critical current and the write power.
A dual-mode architecture for fast-switching STT-RAM has
been proposed in [7] which can switch between two operation
modes for either high data accuracy or low power consump-
tion. In the high accuracy mode, the rewrite-after-read scheme
is used to eliminate the data disturbances induced by the read
current. To further reduce both dynamic and system energy
consumption, a selective restore scheme has been proposed
in [8, 21]. This circuit-based scheme performs a double read
operation with inverted read current to identify and restore all
disturbed cells at the cost of a large read energy overhead.
SECDED (Single Error Correct, Double Error Detect) codes
are used to recover from a single bit error in memory. If a
data block already has an error, it is vulnerable to a second
bit error that cannot be corrected. To prevent the occurrence
of this second error, the memory is constantly examined in the
background. When a single bit error is detected, it is corrected
and the block is written back. This is referred to as Scrubbing
[22, 23]. Memory systems with signiﬁcantly high bit error
rates require the development of scrubbing as an active defense
against uncorrectable multi-failure errors. Moreover, scrubbing
is predominantly valuable for systems where errors occur
from external events to the storage cell (e.g., cross talk,
SEU, etc.). In contrast, the errors we are modeling occur
only from access to the modeled cell. Furthermore, with read
disturbance, scrubbing should refresh/write the data even if
no error is detected since reads from scrubbing may corrupt a
cell, unnecessarily increasing write backs.
D. Our goal
The aforementioned approaches to reduce the read distur-
bances incur signiﬁcant costs in terms of performance, area
and/or energy. The goal of this paper is threefold. First,
using Markov modeling, we build a strong understanding
and characterization of how different types of error and fault
affect user operations. Second, based on this understanding,
