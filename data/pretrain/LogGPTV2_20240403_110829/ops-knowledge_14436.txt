However, the following are some commonly used web servers, you can choose according to your needs: 1. Apache: Apache is one of the most popular and widely used web servers, it can run on almost all operating systems, and supports All major programming languages. 2. Nginx: Nginx is a lightweight web server suitable for handling high-traffic websites. It can also be used as a load balancer and reverse proxy. 3. IIS: IIS is a web server developed by Microsoft and is suitable for Windows server operating systems. It integrates with many other Microsoft technologies such as ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Server. Which web server to choose depends on your needs and the server's environment. If you need to manage a large number of concurrent connections and high traffic, Nginx may be a better choice.
