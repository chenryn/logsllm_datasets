Assurance and Evaluation: What Next?

Abstract 
This  talk  presents  some  observations  on  the  nature  of  system  security  and  security  assurance,  and  on 
processes that attempt to evaluate assurance.  Over the past forty years, approaches to assuring software 
security have evolved from “penetrate and patch” through attempts to prove security to application of 
automated  tools  that  help  developers  detect  and  remove  potential  vulnerabilities.    A  review  of  that 
evolution leads to some observations on the effectiveness and practicality of various approaches and to 
the conclusion that the most theoretically appealing approaches may not be the most practical or likely to 
succeed.   
The  talk  then  considers  the  processes  by  which  user  organizations,  primarily  governments,  have 
attempted  to  evaluate  product  security.    A  review  of  historic  approaches  to  evaluation  supports  the 
conclusion that past evaluation regimes have achieved limited success.  The talk suggests some attributes 
of approaches to evaluation better suited to the realities of processes that achieve security assurance and 
more likely to provide valuable information to end users.
