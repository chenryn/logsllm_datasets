Tracker Crawlers
Fig. 3. Measurement Platform
Our Xunlei DHT Crawler recursively crawls the routing tables of currently
online Xunlei peers to enumerate the list of Xunlei peers in the DHT. For a given
20-byte hash, the crawler works by contacting a Xunlei peer, and asking that
peer for the list of peers in its routing table that are close to the hash. After
receiving new peers, the crawler again contacts these peers to get more new
peers and so on. Given an identiﬁer for a particular ﬁle (URL, BT or eDonkey
identiﬁer), the Xunlei Tracker Crawler continuously contacts the Xunlei central
tracker infrastructure to get the list of Xunlei peers that have the ﬁle. The tracker
crawler also obtains a list of HTTP and FTP servers hosting the ﬁle.
We developed 4 diﬀerent website crawlers and web page parsers customized
for each website. The Gougou Crawler crawls the movie database in the gougou
website. For each indexed movie, it extracts the download link from its movie
information page and passes the links to the Tracker Crawler for gathering peer
lists and server lists. The PirateBay Crawler monitors the Pirate Bay website
for the latest TV shows uploaded to the website; immediately after a TV show
is uploaded, it extracts the corresponding BT infohash for the TV show, and
passes it to the Tracker Crawler to gather the Xunlei peers and HTTP/FTP
servers.
The Public BitTorrent Crawler downloads the list of BT infohashes being
tracked by the public BT tracker site publicbt.com - the largest BT tracker
during the time of our experiments. Finally, the Verycd Crawler extracts the
ed2k links for the eDonkey ﬁles indexed by the popular Chinese eDonkey website
verycd.com.

3.1 Scale of Content Indexed
Given that the Xunlei tracker is tracking content originating from many diﬀerent
sources and protocols, it is of interest to estimate the scale of the tracker, that
is, the number of ﬁles being tracked by Xunlei. In particular, how does the scale
of the China-centric Xunlei tracker compare with the 2.9 million ﬁles (see below)
tracked by the largest BT tracker, which targets a culturally diverse user base?
One approach to getting a handle on the Xunlei content scale is to determine
the fraction of the content in BT and in eDonkey that is being tracked by
Xunlei. To this end, for BT we used the Public BitTorrent Crawler to get the
list of 2, 920, 045 BT infohashes being tracked by the public BT tracker. For
eDonkey, we used the Verycd Crawler to extract the hashes being indexed in
the verycd.com website. We extracted 384, 612 diﬀerent ﬁle pages indexed by
verycd.com, corresponding to a total of 1, 064, 525 diﬀerent ed2k hashes (each
ﬁle can have multiple parts, each of which has a distinct hash value). These BT
and eDonkey hashes were then passed to the Tracker Crawler that determines
which of these are being tracked by Xunlei trackers. We found that 90.3% of the
ﬁles indexed by verycd.com and 47.4% of the ﬁles indexed by Public BitTorrent
are being tracked by Xunlei. Thus, the scale of Xunlei’s tracking is at least on
the order of BT, perhaps signiﬁcantly larger (see below).
Another approach to getting a handle on the Xunlei content scale is to crawl
gougou.com and determine the number of ﬁles indexed there. Using our Gougou
Crawler, we found that gougou indexes 1, 092, 114 distinct ﬁles in the movie cat-
egory. There is also over one million distinct ﬁles in the other Xunlei categories.
So the Xunlei tracker is tracking over 2 million ﬁles. But does the Xunlei tracker
track ﬁles that are not indexed by Gougou? Perhaps the ﬁles in Gougou only
represent the tip of the iceberg? To this end, we observed that approximately
110,000 Gougou movie ﬁles have sources in BT. On the other hand, of the 2.9
million ﬁles indexed by Public BitTorrent tracker, roughly 600,000 are movie
ﬁles. Of these 600,000 movie ﬁles indexed by Public BitTorrent tracker, roughly
280,000 are indexed by the Xunlei tracker (see the 47.4% overlap result above).
Therefore, the number of BT movie ﬁles the Xunlei tracker is tracking at least
2.5 times more than indexed by the Gougou. Hence, the Xunlei tracker is indeed
tracking signiﬁcantly more content than indexed in Gougou.
3.2 Xunlei Swarm Scales
The gougou.com website provides a list of all versions of the top 100 movies in
Xunlei. Using our Gougou Crawler, we extracted the download links for each
of these movie versions and passed them to the TrackerCrawler component.
Figure 4(b) shows the swarm size distribution of the top 75 movies in Xunlei.
For a comparison, we also plot the total swarm sizes for top 75 movies in Pirate
Bay. For calculating the total swarm size for each movie title in Pirate Bay, we
used carefully (manually) chosen strings as inputs to the Pirate Bay movie search
engine and obtained the list of versions for each of the top 75 movie titles and
added up the swarm sizes for all the versions. Although the largest movie swarm
238
P. Dhungel et al.
in Xunlei is smaller than that for Pirate Bay, we see that the swarm sizes start
to converge to similar values after the 60th most popular movie. We also crawled
the trackers for lists of peers watching movies and TV show episodes served by
Kankan. Figure 4(a) shows the snapshot of distribution of swarm sizes for all
1, 591 movies available for VoD. (We performed a number of tracker crawls from
Dec 2010 to Jan 2011. In Figures 4(b), 4(a), we plot the results for crawls that
are close representatives of other crawls.) Kankan movie swarms are as large as
69, 573, much larger than the largest movie swarms in BT. By crawling Kankan
TV shows for a week, we collected 7, 358, 040 unique users. Recall that Kankan
peer IDs can be used to uniquely identify diﬀerent peers. Extrapolating this value
indicates that there should be well over 20 million unique users in a month for
Kankan TV shows. Also, it appears that the VoD component of the Xunlei
network is more popular than the ﬁle downloading component. Nevertheless,
Kankan swarms being larger than the BT swarms and over 7 million unique
users in a week for just the TV show category certainly indicate a huge user
base, probably at least as huge as the user base of BT.
When returning the list of Xunlei peers currently watching a queried Kankan
movie, the Xunlei trackers return private IP addresses for peers coming from
behind NATs. Out of the total 7, 358, 040 unique Kankan IDs collected, 44%
of these peer IDs had private IP addresses. Assuming the Xunlei/Kankan users
form a random sample of the Internet users in China, we can conclude that
approximately 44% of Internet users are behind NATs.

3.3 Geographic Distribution
We now examine the geographical distribution of Xunlei peers. We ran our DHT
crawler for 72 hours and collected 5, 381, 746 peers with distinct . Those peers are from 140 countries, 3, 935 cities and 2, 052 ISPs.
Xunlei: Peer-Assisted Download Acceleration on a Massive Scale
239
Table 2 lists the top 15 countries with the most number of Xunlei peers. To
no surprise, almost 98% of peers come from Mainland China. The population
values are given in millions, and the last column shows the ratio of number of
peers to the total population multiplied by 106. Xunlei client being available
only in Chinese language, this table provides some insight into relative Chinese
populations in diﬀerent countries. For example, Italy has a smaller population
than UK and France, but yet has many more Xunlei users. This is consistent
with recent reports of large Chinese immigration to Italy [1].
3.4 Content Flow from BitTorrent to Servers via Xunlei
Having observed a large fraction of BT content being tracked by Xunlei, we
now investigate the ﬂow of data from BT to Xunlei. To this end, we used our
PirateBay Crawler to continually monitor the upload pages for two of the most
active uploaders in Pirate Bay. As soon as a new TV show gets uploaded by
either uploader, the BT infohash for the ﬁle is passed to our Xunlei Tracker
Crawler, which then continuously crawls the Xunlei trackers to obtain the list of
Xunlei peers and HTTP/FTP server resources every 5 minutes for several days.
None of 219 torrents we monitored were registered in the Xunlei tracker during
the ﬁrst crawl. However, 217 out of 219 were indexed by Xunlei trackers within
12 hours of the upload of the torrent to Pirate Bay, with 85% being indexed by
Xunlei within less than 1 hour. We also observed that for 177 of the monitored
torrents (80%), the Xunlei trackers returned at least one HTTP/FTP server
within 6 days of appearance of the torrent in Pirate Bay. This means that the
ﬁles corresponding to these torrents must have been uploaded to the servers. In
summary, for 177 of 219 popular torrents, the torrent ﬁrst appeared in Pirate
Bay, then in the Xunlei tracker without reference to a server, and ﬁnally in the
Xunlei tracker with reference to one or more servers. The following sequence of
events can result in such a ﬂow of data : 1) A Xunlei user obtains the .torrent
ﬁle from Pirate Bay and then downloads the corresponding ﬁle using the Xunlei
client. As a result of which, Xunlei trackers start tracking this particular ﬁle.
2) The same user (or some other Xunlei user who also performed the actions in
step (1)) uploads the ﬁle to an HTTP/FTP server (e.g., to a cyberlocker, which
often provides incentives to uploaders). This user advertises the link of the ﬁle
in the server via an out-of-band channel, for example, a chat forum. 3) Another
user ﬁnds the server link, and uses its Xunlei client to download the ﬁle. As a
result, the server link is now listed as one of the resources for the ﬁle in Xunlei
trackers.
4Into what kinds of servers were these 177 ﬁles uploaded? The three domains
serving the most ﬁles were megaupload.com, hotﬁle.com, and ﬁleserve.com, serv-
ing 103, 96, and 61 ﬁles respectively. All three of these domains are cyberlockers.
Although Xunlei can leech bandwidth from these (and other) cyberlockers, a user
who directly visits a cyberlocker and uses Xunlei to download a ﬁle will quite
possibly download parts from other sources, including other Xunlei peers. In this
regard, Xunlei provides peer assistance to the cyberlockers.

4 The Gougou Content Index
We now analyze Xunlei from the perspective of content indexing site gougou.com.
Using our Gougou Crawler, for each of 21, 469 movies indexed by Gougou,
we downloaded the corresponding Gougou page and extracted the meta data.
Because each movie typically has many versions, we obtained meta data for
1, 092, 114 distinct ﬁles. Of these 21, 469 movies, 34% came from Hollywood,
20% from China, 18% from Japan, 13% from Hong Kong, and the remaining
15% spread over several other countries.
We extracted the types of sources from each page of movies indexed by
Gougou. HTTP (41%) and FTP (34%) sources clearly dominate the other types
(MMS, RTSP, BT, ed2k, etc. ) of sources available. BT takes the 3rd rank with
about 10% of sources. For the HTTP and FTP sources, 24, 513 and 11, 642 diﬀer-
ent server IPs were found, respectively. The top HTTP server is sharing 23, 727
ﬁles from three domains, and the top FTP server is serving 5, 029 ﬁles under
73 diﬀerent domains. A considerable fraction (12%) of FTP servers come from
Chinese universities. A single FTP server located in a university in China is
sharing as many as 2, 701 ﬁles. Unlike Xunlei peers, a large fraction of sources
originate from outside China, in particular 10% from the US.
5 Conclusion
We studied Xunlei, a download acceleration application that is enormously popu-
lar in China. We uncover the details of several unique technical features in Xunlei.
By developing a comprehensive measurement infrastructure, we observed that
the scale of content indexed by Xunlei is comparable, or perhaps, larger than the
scale of content indexed by the most popular BitTorrent trackers. Similarly, we
observed Xunlei/Kankan movie swarm scales to be comparable to that of Bit-
Torrent. We found that HTTP and FTP sources make up the largest fraction of
ﬁle sources indexed in Xunlei. Xunlei users beneﬁt from increased content avail-
ability and increased download speeds. We also observed that Xunlei is currently
providing bandwidth assistance to various cyberlockers and email distributions.
