Could we get the version number in the _deb_ file that is posted on the github
downloads page. It's pretty straight forward for me to grab the next version
every time its released but when I need to quickly rollback my folder has a
bunch of `atom-amd64(N).deb` files.
Super minor and I'll no longer care once we get an offical PPA going but for
the time being it'd be awesome.
