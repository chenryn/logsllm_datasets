I've been writing a custom debug adapter for vscode and have been running into
the following issue:
When deploying your extension in server mode ( at least I haven't tested on
extension host mode ), and the you drop stop the client abruptly, for any
reason, whilst the front-end is still awaiting a request that affects the
variables debug view, then even after the client has stopped, whatever values
were in the view remain there and become locked. Starting a new debug session
does not clear them, you have to open a new window with the project in order
for them to clear.
These screenshots illustrate :

It's happened both in the January and insider's build.
