Adjust C52 for proper LO frequency. If tuning can not be achieved, add 0.5 – 3.3pF 
capacitor to the C2 position and try again. Remove jumpers.
With the Synthesizer locked, Use a quality frequency counter on LO Output and adjust 
the trimmer on Y1 until the desired LO frequency reads true. This method offers greater 
error and thus precision then looking at the 12.8 MHz Reference Output.
If PLL lock can not be achieved, did you remember to program the receiver to use 
‘opposite’ side injection? If not go back and look at Phase 1.
Once tuned remove the module from the frame again and replace RF shield. Insert the 
module back into frame. Verify VCO lock by Fault LED being extinguished. The cover 
will effect tuning slightly and C52 may need a slight tweak to get it back into lock. Power 
cycle the repeater leaving it off for 1 minute and check that the PLL lock took. The fault 
LED should stay lit for approx 5 seconds and go out.
With a spectrum analyzer verify the output of the module to be approximately 1 mW (0 
dBm), Also verify that the harmonics are at least 29dB below carrier.

Phase 4: UHF Receiver Front End Module
Please Refer to LBI38673J  and LBI39129B
Please note that the UHF version of this module does not have a fault LED for the front 
panel. 
According to the newer documentation found in LBI39129D, the parts layout of the R7 
board was changed to only have one helical filter. The parts list does not make 
reference to certain parts shown on the layout, but still contains helical filter FL2 while 
the schematic shows two helical filters. This appears to be an error in the 
documentation in which someone inadvertently switched the correct layout for the G3, 
G4 and G7 module.
Using a Torx T-15 screwdriver, remove the top and bottom lids of the module. Remove 
the pre-selector helical casing.
Stock Receiver Front End Module
With a sharpie, write on the side of each filter it’s previous position, this way you will not 
inadvertently undo your work during reassembly. Carefully desolder and swap FL1 and 
FL2.
The module has the ground plane from hell and can absorb heat from both a 40W Iron 
and a 150W soldering gun at an alarming level. About the only thing I found that was 
able to provide enough heat for the desoldering job was a small butane pencil torch. 
Bernz-o-matic,  Serious Business.
Leave the flame about 3 inches off the board and offset at a 45 degree angle. Pass the 
flame back and forth slowly across the widest part of the filter so you heat both rows 
simultaneously. It takes about 2 minutes to develop enough heat on the ground plane 
where the solder melts and the filter falls free. Have something non-flammable and melt 
resistant under the module to catch the hot filter.
Clean up the hole with a solder sucker and the torch from the solder side of the PCB. 
Heat the solder with the torch so that it goes fluid and suck it clean. Then clean the 
burnt rosin from the board with denatured alcohol and a tooth brush. Also clean the 
excess solder from the filters, use a 40W iron and solder wick.
Helical filters removed, and all cleaned up.
Solder the filters in place. Remember that you wrote where they were, not where they 
are going. So install FL1 at FL2 and FL2 at FL1. This will probably require the hottest tip 
in your arsenal. I used 900 degree ‘R’ and it still wasn’t good enough. With the solder 
best you can get it go over the joints one at a time with the torch and re-melt them.
Clean the rosin residue from the under side of the board again with the tooth brush.
Using heavy gauge wire cutters or a Dremel with a cut off wheel, remove a ¼ turn off of 
the top of each helical coil in the pre-selector. Try not to leave burrs on the ends of the 
coils, use a small nail file or some sanding tape. Clean the area free of copper particles 
with the alcohol and a rag.
Fully modified Receive Front End
New Helical configuration:
Fc: 445 MHz
Bandwidth: 2 MHz
Wire: 0.1” (10 ga.)
Turns: 3.68
Diameter: .637”
Height: .956”
Spacing: .25”
Cavity: 1.17” Square x 1.375”
Impedance: 190 Ohms
Unloaded Q: 1466
At this point you should be able to make the receiver tune to at least -113dBm (0.5uV) 
for 12dB SINAD, -116dBm (0.35uV) typical. 
Reassemble the helical casing and attach the top and bottom covers.
Reassembled Receiver Front End Module
New Receiver Configuration
Phase 5: UHF Receiver Front End Module Tuning
Tuning has to be done with the module out of the T/R frame as there is no way to get 
tools and your hand in there at the same time, I’ve tried. So perform the following 
connections.
RF Input to Spectrum Analyzer Tracking Generator Output
IF Output to Spectrum Analyzer RF Input
LO Output to LO Input via 2’ BNC jumper cable.
Clip lead with +12 (Backplane J5, Pin 3) to L21, C32 Junction. You may have to add a 
wire jumper to make a connection point on the Front end depending on revision of 
board you have, and care should be taken not to short J5.
Receiver Front End Tuning Setup (Improvised TQ0605)
Remove tuning slugs from main the helical casting.
Once that is done set the following on the Spectrum Analyzer, Center frequency = 
Receive frequency, Span 10 MHz, Track Generator +0dBm, 10dB per division.
To get close, start with only the first slug, the one closest to the RF Input jack. Replace 
the retention nut on the slug and insert back into the helical casting. Tighten down the 
nut until the slug moves at the desired tension. Take the cable feeding the Spectrum 
Analyzer Input and hold it to the next hole in line and tune the first slug until the peak is 
at the center range. The signal should be -70 to -50dB down from +0dBm.
Repeat procedure with following slugs advancing to next set of holes. Adjust for best 
flatness at the top of the graph.
When on the last slug connect SA Input back to LO Output of Receiver Front End 
Module.  Readings are now approximately 40dB down from the input. Adjust the last 
slug for maximum level. Remove the top lid and tune FL1 to for maximum level and 
then proceed to adjust L1-L5 and FL1 for best possible response. The response should 
be tuned to 3 MHz wide at the 3dB points. 
Receiver Front End Spectrum Analysis
Now swap the cables on the module between RF In and IF Out
Tune FL2 for maximum level and then set for best response over 418.6 – 428.6 MHz. 
Signal level should be about -13dBm from generator output level.
LO to IF port Spectrum Analysis
To test for conversion gain, swap cables back to original positions and set Spectrum 
Analyzer center frequency to 21.4 MHz. Offset the tracking generator so the output 
sweeps the center receiver frequency (441.3 MHz - 21.4 MHz = 419.9 MHz). The level 
of 21.4 MHz pass band should be within 1dB of tracking generator output signal 
(-0dBm).

Note, that some stations may have accessory cards in the blank areas.
Connect service monitor with SINAD measuring ability to RF Input and take a 
connection from the station speaker for audio. Verify Receiver comes to factory 
specification of -116dBm (0.35uV), mine comes to -121dBm (0.20uV), be sure to add 
cable loss into your figures.
External controller interfacing may be done following the instructions here:

Phase 7: UHF Low Split Power Amplifier
Please Refer to LBI38674L
Your station should include a Group 3 low pass filter which is designed for 376 – 470 
MHz. The circuitry for the UHF Low Pass Filter is perfect, don’t mess with it.
If your station is equipped with the T/R relay and you are converting it to full duplex, 
remove it. Unscrew the 2 Torx screws that hold the mounting bracket to the low pass 
filter and then unscrew the ‘N’ connector between the LPF and relay.
UHF Group 6 power amplifier
The amplifier may perform adequately for your needs, if not replace the following parts:
Remove C36
Remove C41
Replace U1 with Mitsubishi M57704M
Replace C27 with 10pF AVX Porcelain
Replace C28 and C29 with 8.2pF AVX Porcelain
Replace C87 through C90 – 43pF Underwood Case MIN02-002
Replace C91 and C94 with 36pF Underwood Case MIN02-002
Replace C67, C69, C92 and C93 with 39pF Underwood Case MIN02-002
The replacement power module can be obtained from www.RFparts.com. 
Removing M57704L Power Module
Removing the power module requires the use of a Torx T-10 screw driver. After 
removing the previous brick, clean the old heat sink compound from the heat sink and 
apply a fresh thin coating.
Underwood capacitors that are the correct size can be found from www.mouser.com, 
the ones carried by RF parts are too large. The only thing that is difficult to find is the 
AVX style capacitors. Underwood capacitors can be substituted by scraping off 
additional solder mask from the ground planes to accommodate the larger surface area. 
Replacing the Underwood capacitors requires serious amounts of heat. A 150 – 250W 
soldering gun is the recommended armament.
New M57704M Power Module, and replaced capacitors
Connect the output from the Transmit side of the T/R frame to the input of the Power 
Amplifier. In MASTRUTL.BAT from the Potentiometer screen adjust Power Output to 
99. 
Unscrew the Low Pass Filter and lid from the PA assembly. Connect a Bird 43 with a 
suitable dummy load and 250W 400 – 1000 MHz slug or equivalent to the output 
connector of the LPF. Key the repeater. Adjust the potentiometer on the Power Amplifier 
board until 110W is indicated on the meter, mine is labeled ‘R43’.  Warning: 
misadjustment may result in amplifier failure. Adjust the Power Output value in the 
software until the desired power level is achieved.
Reattach the lid and Low Pass Filter and reassemble the repeater.
