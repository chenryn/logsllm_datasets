### Adjusting C52 for Proper LO Frequency
1. **Adjust C52** to achieve the correct Local Oscillator (LO) frequency.
2. **If tuning is not achieved**, add a 0.5 – 3.3 pF capacitor to the C2 position and attempt tuning again.
3. **Remove jumpers**.

### Locking the Synthesizer
1. **With the Synthesizer locked**, use a high-quality frequency counter on the LO Output.
2. **Adjust the trimmer on Y1** until the desired LO frequency is accurately displayed.
3. **This method provides greater precision** compared to monitoring the 12.8 MHz Reference Output.

### Troubleshooting PLL Lock
1. **If PLL lock cannot be achieved**, ensure that the receiver is programmed for 'opposite' side injection.
2. **If not, refer back to Phase 1**.

### Final Tuning and Verification
1. **Once tuned, remove the module from the frame** and replace the RF shield.
2. **Reinsert the module into the frame**.
3. **Verify VCO lock** by ensuring the Fault LED is extinguished.
4. **The cover may slightly affect tuning**, so C52 may need a slight adjustment to re-establish lock.
5. **Power cycle the repeater**, leaving it off for 1 minute, and check that the PLL lock is maintained. The fault LED should stay lit for approximately 5 seconds and then turn off.
6. **Using a spectrum analyzer, verify** the output of the module to be approximately 1 mW (0 dBm) and ensure that harmonics are at least 29 dB below the carrier.

### UHF Receiver Front End Module
#### Documentation and Layout
- **Refer to LBI38673J and LBI39129B**.
- **Note**: The UHF version of this module does not have a fault LED for the front panel.
- **According to LBI39129D**, the R7 board layout was changed to include only one helical filter. The parts list does not reference certain parts shown in the layout but still includes helical filter FL2, while the schematic shows two helical filters. This appears to be a documentation error where the correct layout for the G3, G4, and G7 modules was inadvertently switched.

#### Disassembly and Filter Swap
1. **Using a Torx T-15 screwdriver, remove the top and bottom lids of the module**.
2. **Remove the pre-selector helical casing**.
3. **Label each filter with its previous position** using a sharpie to avoid confusion during reassembly.
4. **Desolder and swap FL1 and FL2**. The module's ground plane can absorb a significant amount of heat, requiring a small butane pencil torch for effective desoldering.
5. **Heat the filter for about 2 minutes** at a 45-degree angle, 3 inches away from the board, to melt the solder and free the filter.
6. **Clean the holes with a solder sucker and torch**. Use denatured alcohol and a toothbrush to clean the burnt rosin.
7. **Solder the filters in place**, ensuring FL1 is installed in the FL2 position and vice versa. Use the hottest tip available, such as a 900-degree 'R' tip, and re-melt the joints with the torch if necessary.

#### Modifying the Helical Filters
1. **Use heavy gauge wire cutters or a Dremel with a cut-off wheel** to remove a ¼ turn from the top of each helical coil in the pre-selector.
2. **File or sand the ends of the coils** to remove burrs and clean the area with alcohol and a rag.

#### New Helical Configuration
- **Center Frequency (Fc): 445 MHz**
- **Bandwidth: 2 MHz**
- **Wire: 0.1” (10 ga.)**
- **Turns: 3.68**
- **Diameter: .637”**
- **Height: .956”**
- **Spacing: .25”**
- **Cavity: 1.17” Square x 1.375”**
- **Impedance: 190 Ohms**
- **Unloaded Q: 1466**

#### Reassembly and Testing
1. **Reassemble the helical casing and attach the top and bottom covers**.
2. **The receiver should now tune to at least -113 dBm (0.5 uV) for 12 dB SINAD, typically -116 dBm (0.35 uV)**.

### UHF Receiver Front End Module Tuning
1. **Tune the module out of the T/R frame** due to space constraints.
2. **Connect the following**:
   - **RF Input to Spectrum Analyzer Tracking Generator Output**
   - **IF Output to Spectrum Analyzer RF Input**
   - **LO Output to LO Input via a 2’ BNC jumper cable**
   - **Clip lead with +12V (Backplane J5, Pin 3) to L21, C32 Junction**. Add a wire jumper if necessary, and avoid shorting J5.
3. **Set the Spectrum Analyzer** to Center frequency = Receive frequency, Span 10 MHz, Track Generator +0 dBm, 10 dB per division.
4. **Tune the slugs** starting with the first one closest to the RF Input jack. Replace the retention nut and insert the slug back into the helical casting. Tighten the nut until the slug moves at the desired tension.
5. **Tune each slug** for the best flatness at the top of the graph.
6. **Connect the SA Input back to the LO Output of the Receiver Front End Module**. Adjust the last slug for maximum level.
7. **Tune FL1 for maximum level** and adjust L1-L5 and FL1 for the best possible response. The response should be 3 MHz wide at the 3 dB points.
8. **Swap the cables between RF In and IF Out**.
9. **Tune FL2 for maximum level** and set for the best response over 418.6 – 428.6 MHz. Signal level should be about -13 dBm from generator output level.
10. **Test for conversion gain** by swapping cables back to original positions and setting the Spectrum Analyzer center frequency to 21.4 MHz. Offset the tracking generator to sweep the center receiver frequency (441.3 MHz - 21.4 MHz = 419.9 MHz). The level of the 21.4 MHz pass band should be within 1 dB of the tracking generator output signal (-0 dBm).

### T/R Frame Assembly
1. **Replace modules in the T/R frame in the following order (Left to Right)**:
   - **Large Cards**:
     - Transmit Synthesizer Module
     - Receiver Synthesizer Module
     - Receiver Front End Module
     - Receiver IF Module
   - **Small Cards**:
     - System Module
     - Blank
     - Blank
     - Blank
     - Power Module

2. **Some stations may have accessory cards in the blank areas**.

### Final Testing
1. **Connect a service monitor with SINAD measuring ability** to the RF Input and take a connection from the station speaker for audio.
2. **Verify the Receiver meets factory specifications** of -116 dBm (0.35 uV), accounting for cable loss.

### External Controller Interfacing
- **Follow the instructions** provided at: [http://www.hamrepeater.com/n0ndp/GE-Ericsson-MACOM/Mastr-III%20manuals/mastr3ctrl.doc](http://www.hamrepeater.com/n0ndp/GE-Ericsson-MACOM/Mastr-III%20manuals/mastr3ctrl.doc)

### UHF Low Split Power Amplifier
#### Refer to LBI38674L
1. **Your station should include a Group 3 low pass filter** designed for 376 – 470 MHz. Do not modify the UHF Low Pass Filter circuitry.
2. **If converting to full duplex, remove the T/R relay**. Unscrew the 2 Torx screws holding the mounting bracket to the low pass filter and unscrew the 'N' connector between the LPF and relay.

#### Amplifier Performance
- **If the amplifier does not meet your needs, replace the following parts**:
  - **Remove C36 and C41**
  - **Replace U1 with Mitsubishi M57704M**
  - **Replace C27 with 10 pF AVX Porcelain**
  - **Replace C28 and C29 with 8.2 pF AVX Porcelain**
  - **Replace C87 through C90 with 43 pF Underwood Case MIN02-002**
  - **Replace C91 and C94 with 36 pF Underwood Case MIN02-002**
  - **Replace C67, C69, C92, and C93 with 39 pF Underwood Case MIN02-002**

#### Removing and Replacing the Power Module
1. **Use a Torx T-10 screwdriver** to remove the power module.
2. **Clean the old heat sink compound** and apply a fresh thin coating.
3. **Underwood capacitors** can be found at [www.mouser.com](http://www.mouser.com). The AVX style capacitors are difficult to find, but Underwood capacitors can be substituted by scraping off additional solder mask from the ground planes.
4. **Replacing the Underwood capacitors requires a 150 – 250 W soldering gun**.

#### Power Amplifier Adjustment
1. **Connect the output from the Transmit side of the T/R frame** to the input of the Power Amplifier.
2. **In MASTRUTL.BAT, adjust Power Output to 99**.
3. **Unscrew the Low Pass Filter and lid from the PA assembly**.
4. **Connect a Bird 43 with a suitable dummy load and 250 W 400 – 1000 MHz slug** to the output connector of the LPF.
5. **Key the repeater and adjust the potentiometer** on the Power Amplifier board until 110 W is indicated on the meter.
6. **Warning: Misadjustment may result in amplifier failure**. Adjust the Power Output value in the software until the desired power level is achieved.
7. **Reattach the lid and Low Pass Filter** and reassemble the repeater.
