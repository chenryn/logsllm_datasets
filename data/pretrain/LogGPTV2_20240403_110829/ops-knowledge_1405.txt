User: How to set Linux kernel parameters to optimize server performance? Please provide some classic kernel parameter optimization schemes.
Assistant: Linux kernel parameter optimization can improve server performance. Here are some classic kernel parameter optimization solutions: 1. Improve file system performance fs.file-max: Set the maximum number of file handles in the system. The higher the value, the more the system can handle connected simultaneously. vm.swappiness: Adjust the degree of memory swap, reduce the call of system swap space, and improve the response speed of the system. vm.dirty_ratio and vm.dirty_background_ratio: Set the proportion of dirty pages in memory to reduce the impact of write operations on system performance. 2. Improve network performance net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies: Enable SYN Cookie protection mechanism to reduce SYN Flood attacks. net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog: Adjust the maximum length of the TCP connection request queue to avoid loss of connection requests due to high system load. net.core.somaxconn: Adjust the maximum length of the system listening queue to prevent excessive system load caused by too many connections from clients. 3. Improve system performance net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range: Adjust the local port range to avoid port exhaustion and improve system stability. kernel.sysrq: Enable the sysrq function, so that the system can debug and rescue when encountering problems. net.ipv4.ping_group_range: Set the user group range of ping to avoid ping flood attacks. The above are just some common optimization solutions. In fact, there are many other parameters that can be adjusted according to specific scenarios and needs. It should be noted that for those who do not understand kernel parameter optimization, try not to change it at will, so as not to cause system instability or performance degradation.
