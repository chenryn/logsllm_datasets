(cid:4) Will the wirelessly-forwarded sound reach certain
areas where it wouldn’t have been audible otherwise?
This may be a valid concern for some scenarios, e.g., a person
outside a coffee shop may be able to “hear” inside conver-
sations. However, with power control, beamforming, and
sound scrambling, the problem can be alleviated. We leave
a deeper treatment of this problem to future work. On the
other hand, this may not be a problem in other scenarios.
For instance, with personal table-top devices, the wireless
range can be around the user’s table, resulting in almost no
leakage. For smart noise, the noise need not be protected
at all, while for call center-like settings, acoustic privacy is
relatively less serious.
5 EVALUATION
We begin with some details on experimental setup and com-
parison schemes, followed by performance results.
5.1 Experimental Setup
MUTE’s core algorithms are implemented on the Texas In-
strument’s TMS320C6713 DSP board [6], equipped with
the TLV320AIC23 codec. The microphones are SparkFun’s
MEMS Microphone ADMP401 and the anti-noise speaker
is the AmazonBasics computer speaker. Ambient noise is
played from an Xtrememac IPU-TRX-11 speaker. All micro-
phones and speakers are cheap off-the-shelf equipment. For

performance comparison, we purchased Bose’s latest ANC
headphone, the QC35 [10] (pictured in Figure 11).
For experimentation, we insert a separate “measurement
microphone” at the ear-drum location of a 3D head model
(Figure 2(b)) – this serves as the approximation of what the
human would hear. We play various sounds from the ambient
speaker and measure the power level at this microphone. We
then compare the following schemes:
• MUTE_Hollow: Our error microphone is pasted outside
the ear while the anti-noise speaker and DSP board are
placed next to it, as shown in Figure 2(b).
• Bose_Active: We place the Bose headphone on the 3D head
model and measure cancellation, first with ANC turned
OFF, and then with ANC turned ON. Subtracting the for-
mer from the latter, we get Bose’s active noise cancellation
performance.
• Bose_Overall: We turn on ANC for Bose and measure
the net cancellation, i.e., the combination of its ANC and
passive noise-absorbing material.
Finally, we bring human volunteers to compare Bose and
MUTE. In the absence of a compact form factor for MUTE,
we utilize Bose’s headphone. Specifically, we feed the output
of our DSP board into the AUX input of the Bose headphone
(with its ANC turned OFF), meaning that our LANC algo-
rithm is executed through Bose’s headphone (instead of its
native ANC module). Of course, the passive sound absorb-
ing material now benefits both Bose and MUTE, hence we
call our system MUTE+Passive (see Figure 11). We report
cancellation results for various sounds, including machines,
human speech, and music.
5.2 Performance Results
Our results are aimed at answering the following questions:
(1) Comparison of overall noise cancellation for MUTE_Hollow,
Bose_Active, Bose_Overall, and MUTE+Passive.
(2) Performance comparison for various sound types.
Figure 12: MUTE and Bose’s overall performance.
Figure 12 reports comparative results when wide-band white
noise (which is most unpredictable of all noises) is played
from the ambient speaker. The noise level is maintained at
67 dB at the measurement microphone. Four main points
are evident from the graph. (1) Bose_Active is effective only
at lower frequency bands, implying that Bose must rely on
passive materials to cancel sounds from 1 kHz to 4 kHz.
(2) The ear-blocking passive material is effective at higher
frequencies, giving Bose_Overall a −15 dB average cancella-
tion. (3) MUTE_Hollow is almost comparable to Bose_Overall
even without passive materials, indicating that our LANC
algorithm performs well (Bose_Overall is just 0.9 dB better
on average). (4) When MUTE+Passive gains the advantage
of passive materials, the cancellation is 8.9 dB better than
Bose_Overall, on average.
In summary, MUTE offers two options in the cancellation
versus comfort tradeoff. A user who values comfort (perhaps
for long continuous use) can prefer lightweight, open-ear
MUTE devices at a 0.9 dB compromise from Bose, while one
who cares more about noise suppression can experience 8.9
dB improvement over Bose.
We briefly discuss two technical details: (1) MUTE’s cancella-
tion is capped at 4 kHz due to limited processing speed of
the TMS320C6713 DSP. It can sample at most 8 kHz to finish
the computation within one sampling interval. A faster DSP
will ease the problem. (2) The diminishing cancellation at
very low frequencies (<100Hz) is due to the weak response
of our cheap microphone and anti-noise speaker – Figure 13
plots the combined frequency response.

we turned ON native ANC on both ears. In this setup, we
played various human voices and music through the ambient
speaker. Since fine grained (per-frequency) comparison is
difficult for humans, we requested an overall rating between
1 to 5 stars. We did not tell the volunteers when MUTE or
Bose was being used for cancellation.

anti-noise speaker and the microphone.
(cid:4) Varying Ambient Sounds (Speech, Music)
Figure 14 shows MUTE’s cancellation performance across
4 different types of real-world noises with different spec-
tral characteristics: male voice, female voice, construction
sound, and music. The results are a comparison between
MUTE_Hollow and Bose_Overall. Our lookahead-aware ANC
algorithm achieves mean cancellation within 0.9dB to Bose’s
native ANC combined with its carefully perfected passive
sound-absorbing materials [10].

Bose_Overall, measured for 4 types of ambient sounds.
(cid:4) Human Experience
We invited 5 volunteers to rate MUTE+Passive’s performance
relative to Bose_Overall. Recall that for MUTE+Passive, we
use the Bose headset with ANC turned OFF. Now, since we
have only one DSP board, we were able to run MUTE+Passive
only on the right ear – for the left ear, we use both an earplug
and the headset (with ANC turned OFF). For Bose_Overall,

Figure 15 shows the comparison for music and human voice.
Every volunteer consistently rated MUTE above Bose. Their
subjective opinions were also strongly positive. However, al-
most all of them also said that “Bose was superb at canceling
hums in the environment”, and MUTE did not perform as
well. One reason is the weak response of the speaker and
microphone at low frequencies, as mentioned before. Upon
analyzing, we also realized that the background hums are
from various sources. With Bose’s microphone array, they
are equipped to handle such scenarios, while our current sys-
tem is aimed at a single noise source (the ambient speaker).
We have left multi-source noise cancellation to future work,
as discussed later in Section 6.
(cid:4) Impact of Shorter Lookahead
Lookahead reduces when the wireless relay gets closer to the
user, or when the location of the noise source changes such
that the time-difference between direct path and wireless-
relay path grows smaller. For accurate comparison across
different lookaheads, we need to ensure that the physical en-
vironment (i.e., multipath channel) remains identical. There-
fore, instead of physically moving the noise source or the
wireless relay (to vary lookahead time), we fix their positions,
but deliberately inject delays into the reference signal within
the DSP processor (using a delayed line buffer).
Figure 16 plots the results for MUTE_Hollow. The lookahead
times are expressed relative to the “Lower Bound” from Equa-
tion 3 (recall that lookahead must be greater than ADC + DSP
processing + DAC + speaker delay, as explained in Section
3.1). Evidently, as the lookahead increases, the performance
improves due to better inverse filtering.

performance degrades.
(cid:4) Profiling and Cancellation
To highlight the efficacy of sound profiling and filter switch-
ing, we run a separate experiment where wide-band back-
ground noise is constantly being played from one ambient
speaker, while mixed human voice (with pauses) is being
played from another speaker. We compare the residual error
of MUTE’s filter selection mechanism with that of using only
one adaptive filter. Figure 17 shows the cancellation gain
in MUTE_Hollow with profiling and switching turned ON.
Evidently, the cancellation improves by 3 dB on average. We
could not compare with Bose in this case since Bose uses
at least 6 microphones to cope with scattered noise sources.
Upgrading MUTE with that many microphones is bound to
offer substantial advantage.

vides additional gain for intermittent noise cancella-
tion.
(cid:4) Wireless Relay Selection
Does the correlation technique to identify (maximum) posi-
tive lookahead work in real environments? Figure 18 shows
two typical examples of GCC-PHAT based cross-correlation
between the forwarded sound waveform and the directly-
received sound. Observe that one case is positive lookahead
while the other is negative. MUTE was able to correctly de-
termine these cases in every instance.
Now consider multiple relays and different locations of the
noise source. Figure 19 shows MUTE’s ability to correctly
pick the wireless relay depending on the ambient speaker
location in the room. We place the MUTE client at the center

of the room, and three wireless relays around the edges and
corners. We observe that when the ambient speaker is near
the i-th relay, MUTE selects that relay consistently. We also
observe that when the noise source is closer to the MUTE
client location, no relay is selected because all of them offer
negative lookahead.
Figure 19: MUTE client associates with appropriate RF
relays, depending on the location of the noise source.
6 CURRENT LIMITATIONS
Needless to say, there is room for further work and improve-
ment. We discuss a few points here.
• Multiple Noise Sources: Our experiments were performed
in natural indoor environments, with a dominant noise
source (such as a human talking on the phone, or music from
an audio speaker). With multiple noise sources, the problem
is involved, requiring either multiple microphones (one for
each noise channel), or source separation algorithms that
depend on statistical independence among sources. Today’s
ANC headphones utilize at least 6 microphones and source
separation algorithms to mitigate such issues. We believe
the benefits of looking ahead into future samples will be
valuable for multiple sources as well – a topic we leave to
future work.
• Cancellation at the Human Ear: We have aimed at achiev-
ing noise cancellation at the measurement microphone, un-
der the assumption that the ear-drum is also located close
to the error microphone. Bose, Sony, and other companies
take a step further, i.e., they utilize anatomical ear mod-
els (e.g., KEMAR head [4]) and design for cancellation at
the human ear-drum. Thus, Bose’s performance may have

been sub-optimal in our experiments. However, even with-
out ear-model optimizations, our human experiments have
returned positive feedback. Of course, a more accurate com-
parison with Bose would require MUTE to also adopt human
ear-models, and then test with large number of human sub-
jects. We have left this to future work. Finally, companies
like Nura [14] are leveraging in-ear acoustic signals to build
personalized ear models. Embracing such models are likely
to benefit both MUTE and Bose.
• Head Mobility: We have side-stepped human head mobil-
ity since our error microphone is static around the head
model. Of course, head mobility will cause faster channel
fluctuations, slowing down convergence. While this affects
all ANC realizations (including Bose and Sony headphones),
the issue has been alleviated by bringing enhanced filtering
methods known to converge faster. We plan to also apply
such mobility-aware LMS techniques in our future versions
of MUTE.
• Portability: While Bose and Sony headphones are easily
portable, MUTE requires the user to be around the IoT relay.
While this may serve most static use cases (e.g., working at
office, snoozing at the airport, sleeping at home, working
out in the gym, etc.), headphones may be advantageous in
completely mobile scenarios, like running on the road.
• RF Interference and Channel Contention: Our system
