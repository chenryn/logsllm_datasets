### 4. Wireless Sound Transmission and Privacy Concerns

Will the wirelessly-forwarded sound reach areas where it would not otherwise be audible? This is a valid concern in certain scenarios, such as a person outside a coffee shop potentially "hearing" inside conversations. However, this issue can be mitigated through power control, beamforming, and sound scrambling. A more detailed examination of this problem is left for future work. In other scenarios, this may not be a significant issue. For example, with personal table-top devices, the wireless range is typically limited to the user's immediate vicinity, minimizing the risk of sound leakage. Additionally, for smart noise cancellation, acoustic privacy is less critical, and in call center-like settings, the need for acoustic privacy is relatively lower.

### 5. Evaluation

#### 5.1 Experimental Setup

MUTE’s core algorithms are implemented on the Texas Instruments TMS320C6713 DSP board, equipped with the TLV320AIC23 codec. The microphones used are SparkFun’s MEMS Microphone ADMP401, and the anti-noise speaker is an AmazonBasics computer speaker. Ambient noise is played from an Xtrememac IPU-TRX-11 speaker. All microphones and speakers are off-the-shelf, cost-effective components. For performance comparison, we also tested Bose’s latest ANC headphone, the QC35 (see Figure 11).

For experimentation, we placed a separate "measurement microphone" at the ear-drum location of a 3D head model (Figure 2(b)) to approximate what a human would hear. We then played various sounds from the ambient speaker and measured the power level at this microphone. The following schemes were compared:

- **MUTE_Hollow**: Our error microphone is placed outside the ear, with the anti-noise speaker and DSP board nearby (Figure 2(b)).
- **Bose_Active**: The Bose headphone is placed on the 3D head model, and cancellation is measured with ANC turned OFF and ON. The difference gives Bose’s active noise cancellation performance.
- **Bose_Overall**: With ANC turned ON, we measure the net cancellation, which includes both ANC and passive noise-absorbing materials.

We also conducted human trials to compare MUTE and Bose. Since MUTE does not have a compact form factor, we used the Bose headphone, feeding the output of our DSP board into the AUX input (with Bose’s ANC turned OFF). This setup, called MUTE+Passive, benefits from both Bose’s passive sound-absorbing material and MUTE’s LANC algorithm (see Figure 11). Cancellation results were reported for various sounds, including machine noise, human speech, and music.

#### 5.2 Performance Results

Our results aim to answer the following questions:

1. Comparison of overall noise cancellation for MUTE_Hollow, Bose_Active, Bose_Overall, and MUTE+Passive.
2. Performance comparison for different sound types.

**Figure 12: MUTE and Bose’s Overall Performance**

Figure 12 shows comparative results when wide-band white noise (the most unpredictable type) is played from the ambient speaker, with the noise level maintained at 67 dB at the measurement microphone. Key observations include:

1. **Bose_Active** is effective only at lower frequency bands, indicating that Bose relies on passive materials to cancel sounds from 1 kHz to 4 kHz.
2. **Bose_Overall** achieves an average cancellation of -15 dB due to the effectiveness of the passive material at higher frequencies.
3. **MUTE_Hollow** is almost comparable to Bose_Overall even without passive materials, suggesting that our LANC algorithm performs well (Bose_Overall is just 0.9 dB better on average).
4. **MUTE+Passive** outperforms Bose_Overall by 8.9 dB on average, leveraging the advantages of passive materials.

In summary, MUTE offers two options in the cancellation versus comfort tradeoff. Users who value comfort can prefer lightweight, open-ear MUTE devices with a 0.9 dB compromise from Bose, while those prioritizing noise suppression can experience an 8.9 dB improvement over Bose.

**Technical Details:**

1. **Frequency Limitation**: MUTE’s cancellation is capped at 4 kHz due to the limited processing speed of the TMS320C6713 DSP, which can sample at most 8 kHz within one sampling interval. A faster DSP would alleviate this issue.
2. **Low-Frequency Response**: Diminishing cancellation at very low frequencies (<100 Hz) is due to the weak response of our inexpensive microphone and anti-noise speaker (see Figure 13 for the combined frequency response).

**Figure 13: Combined Frequency Response of Anti-Noise Speaker and Microphone**

**Human Experience:**

We invited five volunteers to rate MUTE+Passive’s performance relative to Bose_Overall. For MUTE+Passive, we used the Bose headset with ANC turned OFF, and ran MUTE+Passive only on the right ear. For the left ear, we used both an earplug and the headset (with ANC turned OFF). Figure 15 shows the comparison for music and human voice. Every volunteer consistently rated MUTE above Bose, with strong positive subjective opinions. However, they noted that Bose was superior at canceling environmental hums, likely due to its microphone array and multi-source handling capabilities.

**Impact of Lookahead:**

Lookahead reduces when the wireless relay gets closer to the user or when the noise source changes, making the time-difference between direct and relay paths smaller. To accurately compare different lookaheads, we fixed the positions of the noise source and wireless relay but injected delays into the reference signal within the DSP processor.

**Figure 16: System Performance with Varying Lookahead**

As lookahead increases, performance improves due to better inverse filtering. Conversely, as lookahead decreases, system performance degrades.

**Profiling and Cancellation:**

To highlight the efficacy of sound profiling and filter switching, we conducted an experiment with constant wide-band background noise and mixed human voice (with pauses) from another speaker. Figure 17 shows the cancellation gain in MUTE_Hollow with profiling and switching enabled, resulting in an average improvement of 3 dB. Comparing with Bose was not possible as Bose uses at least six microphones for scattered noise sources.

**Figure 17: Cancellation Gain with Filter Switching**

**Wireless Relay Selection:**

We evaluated the correlation technique to identify the maximum positive lookahead in real environments. Figure 18 shows two typical examples of GCC-PHAT based cross-correlation between the forwarded and directly-received sound waveforms. MUTE correctly determined the cases in every instance.

**Figure 18: Cross-Correlation for Lookahead Determination**

For multiple relays and different noise source locations, Figure 19 shows MUTE’s ability to select the appropriate wireless relay. When the ambient speaker is near the i-th relay, MUTE consistently selects that relay. If the noise source is closer to the MUTE client, no relay is selected due to negative lookahead.

### 6. Current Limitations

There is room for further work and improvement. Some key points include:

- **Multiple Noise Sources**: Our experiments focused on a single dominant noise source. Handling multiple noise sources requires either multiple microphones or source separation algorithms. Future work will explore the benefits of lookahead for multiple sources.
- **Cancellation at the Human Ear**: Our current setup aims for noise cancellation at the measurement microphone, assuming it is close to the ear-drum. Companies like Bose and Sony use anatomical ear models for better cancellation. Future work will involve adopting human ear models for a more accurate comparison.
- **Head Mobility**: Our error microphone is static, so head mobility is not currently considered. Enhanced filtering methods that converge faster will be applied in future versions of MUTE to address this issue.
- **Portability**: While Bose and Sony headphones are portable, MUTE requires the user to be near the IoT relay. This limitation affects completely mobile scenarios.
- **RF Interference and Channel Contention**: Our system needs to handle RF interference and channel contention, which will be addressed in future work.
