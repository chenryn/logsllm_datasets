I think this happens specifically for pandas scatter plots with colorbars in
ipython. The xticks are still working for:
  * non-colorbar pandas scatter plots
  * the same scatter plot using matplotlib
  * standard python scripts using `plt.savefig`
related problem with `%matplotlib inline`?: ipython/ipython#1443
