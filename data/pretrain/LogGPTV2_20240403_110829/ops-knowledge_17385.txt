User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题iptables: Allowing only established outgoing connections like DMZ I want to simulate a DMZ like scenario where server1(inside DMZ, 10.1.1.0) should be able to respond to any incoming connection and cann't make a new outgoing connection on its own.

I would appreciate if someone provides a working example.

Example: 

I am doing a simple test. I am accessing the webpage hosted at 10.1.1.10 from 10.2.2.10. So if this rule were to allow all incoming and only related/established outgoing I should be able to open the webpage and do all stuff on that. But with this rule I am not able to access the webpage. If I do nc -v  80 from 10.2.2.10 (server2). I am getting success and also could see incoming packets in tshark

I tried a iptables rule but it does not work the way I expect

*filter
-A INPUT  -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -m state --state NEW -j DROP
-A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED
COMMIT


Iptables -L -nv output

iptables -L -nv

I am running CentOS 6.4.

Assistant: A fairly generic answer (i'm sure there are better ones elsewhere on serverfault if you search) is: if iptables isn't working as you expect, you should:


add logging rules at appropriate points and watch the log as you generate the traffic
watch the counters on your rules with iptables -L -n -v as you generate the traffic
and (my favourite) use an iptables preprocessor like Shorewall to do the heavy lifting of creating the rules for you
