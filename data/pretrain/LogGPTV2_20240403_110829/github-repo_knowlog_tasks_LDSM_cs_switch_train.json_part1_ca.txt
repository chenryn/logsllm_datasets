VINES takes corrective measures allocating new memory block in such  a event. In most cases this error message is just a warning. It does not indicate an imminent crash and should not be cause for panic. The internal data structure size for a VINES neighbor entry is 128 bytes and for a routing table entry size it is 64 bytes. In some cases  finding the real cause of this problem may require multiple levels of memory dump and the first memory dump suggested above is just a beginning."
