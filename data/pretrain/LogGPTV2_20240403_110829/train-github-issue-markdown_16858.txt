Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
When using `useState()` hook in a functional component, I get the following
error:
> Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**  
The functional component where the hook is being used:
    const AuthForm = () => {
      const [value, setValue] = useState(1);
      return (
           setValue(value)}
          >
      );
    };
