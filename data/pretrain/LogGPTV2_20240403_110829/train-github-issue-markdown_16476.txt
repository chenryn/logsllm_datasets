i think package.json shouldn't be deprecated, but changed: the current
proposal suggest full urls in the imports; i suggest the full urls will reside
on the package.json, along with the version, and have a semantic short-name
for the imported package, so it would be easier to refer to it from the
multitudes of projects files... Also, i'd suggest an option to provide a
repository short-name in the package.json, so make the more readable.
example:
    {
      repositories: {
        kuku: 'https://www.github.com/kuku/'
      },
      dependencies: {
        matrices: '@kuku/matrix-utils@~2.0.0'
       }
    }
the usage is simple:
my-code.ts:
    import {multiply} from 'matrices' // or perhaps  import {multiply} from '@matrices' 
    ...
    ...
