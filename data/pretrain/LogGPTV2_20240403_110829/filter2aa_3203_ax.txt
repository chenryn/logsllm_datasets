### Obtaining Additional Configuration Parameters

#### The Initializing State
In the Initializing state, the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) client is in the process of initializing TCP/IP and does not yet have an IPv4 address configuration. This state occurs when the TCP/IP protocol stack is first initialized after being configured for automatic configuration, or when the DHCP client cannot renew the lease on an existing IPv4 address.

- **IPv4 Address**: When the DHCP client is in the Initializing state, its IPv4 address is set to 0.0.0.0, also known as the unspecified address.
- **First Task**: The DHCP client's primary task is to obtain an IPv4 address configuration by broadcasting a `DHCPDiscover` message from UDP port 67 to UDP port 68.
- **Broadcast Details**:
  - **Source IP**: 0.0.0.0 (unspecified address)
  - **Destination IP**: 255.255.255.255 (limited broadcast address)
  - **Content**: The `DHCPDiscover` message includes the DHCP clientâ€™s MAC (Media Access Control) address and computer name.

#### Handling the `DHCPDiscover` Message
- **Directly Connected DHCP Server**:
  - If a DHCP server is on the same subnet as the DHCP client, it receives the broadcast `DHCPDiscover` message directly.
- **DHCP Relay Agent**:
  - If no DHCP server is on the same subnet, a DHCP relay agent on the client's subnet receives the `DHCPDiscover` message and relays it as a unicast message to one or more DHCP servers.
  - **Relay Agent Modifications**:
    - **Hops Field**: Increments the Hops field in the DHCP header, indicating the number of relay agents that have handled the message.
    - **Giaddr Field**: If the Giaddr (Gateway IP Address) field is 0.0.0.0, the relay agent sets it to the IPv4 address of the interface on which the `DHCPDiscover` message was received.
    - **Source and Destination IPs**: Changes the source IP to the relay agent's IP and the destination IP to the unicast IP of a DHCP server.

#### The Selecting State
In the Selecting state, the DHCP client can choose from the set of IPv4 address configurations offered by the DHCP servers.

- **DHCPOffer Messages**:
  - All DHCP servers that receive the `DHCPDiscover` message and have a valid IPv4 address configuration for the client respond with a `DHCPOffer` message from UDP port 68 to UDP port 67.
  - **Scope Determination**:
    - The DHCP server uses the Giaddr field to determine the appropriate scope from which to allocate an IPv4 address.
    - **Process**:
      1. If Giaddr is 0.0.0.0, set it to the IP of the interface that received the `DHCPDiscover` message.
      2. Perform a bit-wise logical AND of the Giaddr value with the subnet mask of each scope. If the result matches the subnet prefix, the DHCP server allocates an IPv4 address from that scope.
  - **Sending DHCPOffer**:
    - If the `DHCPDiscover` message was received as a broadcast, the `DHCPOffer` message is sent directly to the client using the offered IPv4 address and the client's MAC address.
    - If the `DHCPDiscover` message was received as a unicast, the `DHCPOffer` message is sent to the DHCP relay agent, which then forwards it to the client.

- **Client Selection**:
  - The DHCP client selects the first `DHCPOffer` message it receives.
  - If no `DHCPOffer` messages are received, the client continues to retry sending `DHCPDiscover` messages for up to one minute. After one minute, the client may configure an alternate configuration (e.g., APIPA or a manually configured alternate configuration).

#### The Requesting State
In the Requesting state, the DHCP client requests a specific IP address configuration by broadcasting a `DHCPRequest` message.

- **Broadcast Details**:
  - **Source IP**: 0.0.0.0 (unspecified address)
  - **Destination IP**: 255.255.255.255 (limited broadcast address)

- **Message Content**:
  - If the IPv4 address configuration was just obtained via a `DHCPDiscover`/`DHCPOffer` exchange, the `DHCPRequest` message includes the IPv4 address of the server that made the offer.
  - If the client is trying to renew a previously known configuration (e.g., after a restart), the `DHCPRequest` message does not include the server's IP, allowing the client to renew from any DHCP server.

#### The Bound State
In the Bound state, the DHCP client receives confirmation that the DHCP server has allocated and reserved the offered IPv4 address configuration.

- **DHCPAck Message**:
  - The DHCP server sends a `DHCPAck` message from UDP port 68 to UDP port 67, containing the lease period and additional configuration parameters.
  - **Sending Method**:
    - If the `DHCPRequest` was received as a broadcast, the `DHCPAck` is sent directly to the client.
    - If the `DHCPRequest` was received as a unicast, the `DHCPAck` is sent to the DHCP relay agent, which then forwards it to the client.

- **Verification**:
  - The DHCP client verifies that the IPv4 address is unique on the subnet. If it is not, the client broadcasts a `DHCPDecline` message and returns to the Initializing state.

- **DHCPNak Message**:
  - The DHCP server sends a `DHCPNak` if the client is trying to lease an unavailable or invalid IPv4 address. The client then returns to the Initializing state.

#### The Renewing State
In the Renewing state, the DHCP client attempts to renew the lease on its IPv4 address configuration by communicating directly with its DHCP server.

- **Renewal Process**:
  - By default, clients try to renew their lease when 50% of the lease time has expired.
  - The client sends a unicast `DHCPRequest` message to the DHCP server.
  - The DHCP server responds with a `DHCPAck` message, renewing the lease and updating any configuration parameters.

#### The Rebinding State
In the Rebinding state, the DHCP client attempts to renew the lease on its IPv4 address configuration by communicating with any available DHCP server.

- **Rebinding Process**:
  - When 87.5% of the lease time has expired and the client has been unsuccessful in contacting its DHCP server, it broadcasts `DHCPRequest` messages.
  - Any DHCP server can respond with a `DHCPAck` or `DHCPNak`.
  - If the lease expires or the client receives a `DHCPNak`, it must return to the Initializing state.

#### Restarting a Windows DHCP Client
- **Default Behavior**:
  - When a Windows-based DHCP client (Windows XP, Windows Server 2003) is shut down, it does not release the IPv4 address configuration and remains in the Bound state.
  - Upon restart, the client enters the Requesting state and attempts to lease its previously allocated IPv4 address configuration through a broadcasted `DHCPRequest` message.
- **Configuration Change**:
  - You can configure the client to send a `DHCPRelease` message on shutdown using the Microsoft vendor-specific DHCP option "Release DHCP Lease on Shutdown."

#### Installing the DHCP Server Service
- **Windows Server 2008**:
  1. Open Server Manager.
  2. Add the DHCP Server role.
  3. Follow the wizard to configure the DHCP Server service.
- **Windows Server 2003**:
  1. Open Add or Remove Programs.
  2. Add the DHCP Server component.
  3. Configure the DHCP Server service.

#### DHCP and Active Directory Integration
- **Authorization**:
  - The DHCP Server service integrates with Active Directory to authorize DHCP servers.
  - An unauthorized DHCP server will not complete its startup sequence and will shut down.
- **Non-Domain Members**:
  - For DHCP servers not in the domain, the service sends a broadcast `DHCPInform` message to request information about the root Active Directory domain.
