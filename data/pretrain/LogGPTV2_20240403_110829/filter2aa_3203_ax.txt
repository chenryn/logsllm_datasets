To obtain additional configuration parameters. 
The Initializing State 
In the Initializing state, the DHCP client is trying to initialize TCP/IP and it does not yet have an IPv4 
address configuration. This state occurs the first time the TCP/IP protocol stack is initialized after being 
configured for automatic configuration and when the DHCP client cannot renew the lease on an IPv4 
address configuration. 
When the DHCP client is in the Initializing state, its IPv4 address is 0.0.0.0, also known as the 
unspecified address. The DHCP client's first task is to obtain an IPv4 address configuration by 
broadcasting a DHCPDiscover message from UDP port 67 to UDP port 68. Because the DHCP client 
does not yet have an IPv4 address and has not determined the IPv4 addresses of any DHCP servers, 
the source IPv4 address for the DHCPDiscover broadcast is the unspecified address, 0.0.0.0, and the 
destination is the limited broadcast address, 255.255.255.255. The DHCPDiscover message contains 
the DHCP client’s media access control (MAC) address and computer name. 
If a DHCP server is on the DHCP client's subnet, the server receives the broadcast DHCPDiscover 
message. If no DHCP server on the DHCP client’s subnet (a more typical configuration), a DHCP relay 
agent on the DHCP client’s subnet receives the broadcast DHCPDiscover message and relays it as a 
unicast DHCPDiscover message from the DHCP relay agent to one or more DHCP servers. Before 
forwarding the original DHCPDiscover message, the DHCP relay agent makes the following changes: 
Increments the Hops field in the DHCP header of the DHCPDiscover message. The Hops field, which is 
separate from the Time to Live (TTL) field in the IPv4 header, indicates how many DHCP relay agents 
have handled this message. Typically, only one DHCP relay agent is located between any DHCP client 
and any DHCP server.  
If the value of the Giaddr (Gateway IP Address) field in the DHCP header of the DHCPDiscover 
message is 0.0.0.0 (as set by the originating DHCP client), changes the value to the IPv4 address of 
the interface on which the DHCPDiscover message was received. The Giaddr field records the IPv4 
address of an interface on the subnet of the originating DHCP client. The DHCP server uses the value 
of the Giaddr field to determine the address range, known as a scope, from which to allocate an IPv4 
address to the DHCP client. 
Changes the source IPv4 address of the DHCPDiscover message to an IPv4 address assigned to the 
DHCP relay agent.  
Changes the destination IPv4 address of the DHCPDiscover message to the unicast IPv4 address of a 
DHCP server.  
The DHCP relay agent sends the DHCPDiscover message as a unicast IPv4 packet rather than as an 
IPv4 and MAC-level broadcast. If the DHCP relay agent is configured with multiple DHCP servers, it 
sends each DHCP server a copy of the DHCPDiscover message. 
Figure 6-3 shows the sending of the DHCPDiscover message by a DHCP relay agent that is configured 
with two DHCP servers.

The Selecting State 
In the Initializing state, the DHCP client can select from the set of IPv4 address configurations that the 
DHCP servers offered. All DHCP servers that receive the DHCPDiscover message and that have a 
valid IPv4 address configuration for the DHCP client respond with a DHCPOffer message from UDP 
port 68 to UDP port 67. A DHCP server can receive the DHCPDiscover message either as a broadcast 
(because the DHCP server is on the same subnet as the DHCP client) or as a unicast from a DHCP 
relay agent. 
The DHCP server uses the following process to determine the scope on the DHCP server from which 
an IPv4 address for the DHCP client is to be selected and included in the DHCPOffer message: 
1. If the Giaddr field is set to 0.0.0.0, set the value of the Giaddr field to the IPv4 address of the 
interface on which the DHCPDiscover message was received. 
2. For each scope on the DHCP server, perform a bit-wise logical AND of the value in the Giaddr field 
with the subnet mask of the scope. If the result matches the subnet prefix of the scope, the DHCP 
server allocates an IPv4 address from that scope. To obtain the subnet prefix of the scope, the 
DHCP server performs a bit-wise logical AND of the subnet mask of the scope with any address in 
the scope.  
If the DHCPDiscover message was received as a broadcast, the DHCP server sends the DHCPOffer 
message to the DHCP client using the offered IPv4 address as the destination IPv4 address and the 
client's MAC address as the destination MAC address. If the DHCPDiscover message was received as 
a unicast, the DHCP server sends the DHCPOffer message to the DHCP relay agent. The DHCP relay 
agent uses the Giaddr value to determine the interface to use to forward the DHCPOffer message. The 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 167 
DHCP relay agent then forwards the DHCPOffer message to the client using the offered IPv4 address 
as the destination IPv4 address and the client's MAC address as the destination MAC address. 
Figure 6-4 shows the sending of the DHCPOffer message. 
Figure 6-4  Sending of DHCPOffer message 
Note  The discussion of how the DHCP server or DHCP relay agent sends DHCP messages to the DHCP 
client during the Selecting, Bound, and Rebinding states assumes that the Broadcast bit in the DHCP 
header of DHCP messages that the DHCP client sends is set to 0. The Broadcast bit indicates whether the 
DHCP client must receive responses to broadcast DHCPDiscover, DHCPRequest, and DHCPDecline 
messages as broadcasts, rather than as unicasts. The DHCP Client service in Windows Server 2003 and 
Windows XP allows unicast responses and therefore always sets the Broadcast bit to 0. The DHCP Client 
service in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista does not allow unicast responses and therefore always 
sets the Broadcast bit to 1. 
The DHCPOffer messages contain the DHCP client’s MAC address, an offered IPv4 address, 
appropriate subnet mask, a server identifier (the IPv4 address of the offering DHCP server), the length 
of the lease, and other configuration parameters. When a DHCP server sends a DHCPOffer message 
offering an IPv4 address, the DHCP server reserves the IPv4 address so that it will not be offered to 
another DHCP client.  
The DHCP client selects the IPv4 address configuration of the first DHCPOffer message it receives. If 
the DHCP client does not receive any DHCPOffer messages, it continues to retry sending 
DHCPDiscover messages for up to one minute. After one minute, a DHCP client based on Windows 
Server 2003 or Windows XP configures an alternate configuration, either through APIPA or an alternate 
configuration that has been configured manually. 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 168 
The Requesting State 
In the Requesting state, the DHCP client requests a specific IP address configuration by broadcasting a 
DHCPRequest message. The client must use a broadcast because it does not yet have a confirmed 
IPv4 address configuration. Just as in the DHCPDiscover message, the DHCP client sends the 
DHCPRequest message from UDP port 67 to UDP port 68 using the source IPv4 address of 0.0.0.0 
and the destination IPv4 address of 255.255.255.255. 
If the DHCP client does not have a DHCP server on its subnet, a DHCP relay agent on its subnet 
receives the broadcast DHCPRequest message and relays it as a unicast DHCPRequest message 
from the DHCP relay agent to one or more DHCP servers. 
The data in the DHCPRequest message varies in the following way, depending on how the requested 
IPv4 address was obtained: 
If the IPv4 address configuration of the DHCP client was just obtained with a 
DHCPDiscover/DHCPOffer message exchange, the DHCP client includes the IPv4 address of the 
server from which it received the offer in the DHCPRequest message. This server identifier causes the 
specified DHCP server to respond to the request and all other DHCP servers to retract their DHCP 
offers to the client. These retractions make the IPv4 addresses that the other DHCP servers offered 
immediately available to the next DHCP client. 
If the IPv4 address configuration of the client was previously known (for example, the computer was 
restarted and is trying to renew its lease on its previous address), the DHCP client does not include the 
IPv4 address of the server from which it received the IPv4 address configuration. This condition 
ensures that when restarting, the DHCP client can renew its IPv4 address configuration from any DHCP 
server.  
Figure 6-5 shows the sending of the DHCPRequest message. 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 169 
Figure 6-5  Sending the DHCPRequest message 
The Bound State 
In the Bound state, the DHCP client receives confirmation that DHCP server has allocated and 
reserved the offered IPv4 address configuration to the DHCP client. The DHCP server that leased the 
requested IPv4 address responds with either a successful acknowledgment (DHCPAck) or a negative 
acknowledgment (DHCPNak). The DHCP server sends the DHCPAck message from UDP port 68 to 
UDP port 67, and the message contains a lease period for the requested IPv4 address configuration as 
well as any additional configuration parameters.  
If the DHCPRequest message was received as a broadcast, the DHCP server sends the DHCPAck 
message to the DHCP client using the offered IPv4 address as the destination IPv4 address and the 
client's MAC address as the destination MAC address. If the DHCPRequest was received as a unicast, 
the DHCP server sends the DHCPAck message to the DHCP relay agent. The DHCP relay agent uses 
the Giaddr value to determine the interface to use to forward the DHCPAck message. The DHCP relay 
agent then forwards the DHCPAck message to the DHCP client using the offered IPv4 address as the 
destination IPv4 address and the DHCP client's MAC address as the destination MAC address. 
Figure 6-6 shows the sending of the DHCPAck message. 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 170 
Figure 6-6  Sending the DHCPAck message 
When the DHCP client receives the DHCPAck message, it enters the Bound state. The DHCP client 
completes the initialization of TCP/IP, which includes verifying that the IPv4 address is unique on the 
subnet. If the IPv4 address is unique, the DHCP client computer can use TCP/IP to communicate. If the 
IPv4 address is not unique, the DHCP client broadcasts a DHCPDecline message and returns to the 
Initializing state. The DHCP server receives the DHCPDecline message either as a broadcast or as a 
unicast through a DHCP relay agent. When the DHCP server receives the DHCPDecline message, it 
marks the offered IPv4 address as unusable.   
A DHCP server sends a DHCPNak (DHCP negative acknowledgement) message if: 
The client is trying to lease its previous IPv4 address and the IPv4 address is no longer available. 
The IPv4 address is invalid because the client has been physically moved to a different subnet.  
The DHCPNak message is forwarded to the DHCP client's subnet using the same method as the 
DHCPAck message. When the DHCP client receives a DHCPNak, it returns to the Initializing state. 
The Renewing State 
In the Renewing state, a DHCP client is attempting to renew the lease on its IPv4 address configuration 
by communicating directly with its DHCP server. By default, DHCP clients first try to renew their lease 
when 50 percent of the lease time has expired. To renew its lease, a DHCP client sends a unicast 
DHCPRequest message to the DHCP server from which it obtained the lease.  
The DHCP server automatically renews the lease by responding with a DHCPAck message. This 
DHCPAck message contains the new lease and additional configuration parameters so that the DHCP 
client can update its settings. For example, the network administrator might have updated settings on 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 171 
the DHCP server since the lease was acquired or last renewed. When the DHCP client has renewed its 
lease, it returns to the Bound state. 
Figure 6-7 shows the DHCP renewing process. 
Figure 6-7  The DHCP renewing process 
The Rebinding State 
In the Rebinding state, a DHCP client is attempting to renew the lease on its IPv4 address configuration 
by communicating directly with any DHCP server. When 87.5 percent of the lease time has expired and 
the DHCP client has been unsuccessful in contacting its DHCP server to renew its lease, the DHCP 
client attempts to contact any available DHCP server by broadcasting DHCPRequest messages. Any 
DHCP server can respond with a DHCPAck message renewing the lease or a DHCPNak message 
denying the continued use of the IPv4 address configuration.  
If the lease expires or the DHCP client receives a DHCPNak message, it must immediately discontinue 
using the IPv4 address configuration and return to the Initializing state. If the client loses its IPv4 
address, communication over TCP/IP will stop until a different IPv4 address is assigned to the client. 
This condition will cause network errors for any applications that attempt to communicate using the 
invalid address. 
Figure 6-8 shows the DHCP rebinding process.

Restarting a Windows DHCP Client 
The DHCP Client service in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 uses these states when leasing an 
IPv4 address configuration from a DHCP server. However, when a Windows-based DHCP client is shut 
down, by default it does not release the IPv4 address configuration and return to the Initializing state. It 
does not send a DHCPRelease message and, from the perspective of the DHCP server, the client is 
still in the Bound state. When the Windows DHCP Client service is restarted, it enters the Requesting 
state and attempts to lease its previously allocated IPv4 address configuration through a broadcasted 
DHCPRequest message. The DHCPRequest is sent to the limited IPv4 broadcast address 
255.255.255.255 and to the MAC-level broadcast address and contains the MAC address and the 
previously allocated IPv4 address of the DHCP client.  
Note  You can change the default behavior of a DHCP client running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 
so that the client sends a DHCPRelease message when it shuts down. To make this change, you use the 
Microsoft vendor-specific DHCP option named Release DHCP Lease on Shutdown. 
Figure 6-9 shows the DHCP states for a Windows-based DHCP client. 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

Figure 6-9  DHCP states for a Windows-based DHCP client 
When a DHCP relay agent on the subnet receives the DHCPRequest message, it makes the following 
changes to the message before forwarding: 
Increments the Hops field in the DHCP header. 
Records the IPv4 address of the interface on which the DHCPRequest message was received in the 
Giaddr field. 
Changes the source IPv4 address of the DHCPRequest message to an IPv4 address assigned to the 
DHCP relay agent. 
Changes the destination IPv4 address to the IPv4 address of a DHCP server. 
When the DHCP server receives the DHCPRequest message, it compares the subnet prefix of client's 
previously allocated IPv4 address to the subnet prefix of the IPv4 address stored in the Giaddr field and 
does the following: 
If the two subnet prefixes are the same and the IPv4 address can be reallocated to the DHCP client, the 
DHCP server sends a DHCPAck to the DHCP relay agent. When the DHCP relay agent receives the 
DHCPAck, the agent re-addresses the message to the client's current IPv4 address and MAC address.  
If the two subnet prefixes are the same and the IPv4 address cannot be reallocated to the DHCP client, 
the DHCP server sends a DHCPNak to the DHCP relay agent. When the DHCP relay agent receives 
the DHCPNak, it sends the message to the client's current IPv4 address and MAC address. At this 
point, the DHCP client goes into the Initializing state. 
If the two subnet prefixes are not the same, the DHCP client has moved to a different subnet, and the 
DHCP server sends a DHCPNak to the DHCP relay agent. When the DHCP relay agent receives the 
DHCPNak, the agent sends the message to the client's current IPv4 address and MAC address. At this 
point, the DHCP client goes into the Initializing state.

The Windows DHCP Server Service 
Before you install a Windows-based DHCP server, ask yourself these questions: 
What IPv4 configuration options will DHCP clients obtain from a DHCP server (such as default 
gateway, DNS servers, a DNS domain name, or WINS servers)?  
The IPv4 configuration options determine how you should configure the DHCP server and whether 
the options should be created for all clients in the entire network, clients on a specific subnet, or 
individual clients. 
Will all computers become DHCP clients?  
If not, consider that non-DHCP clients have static IPv4 addresses, and you might have to exclude 
those addresses from the scopes that you create on DHCP servers. If a specific DHCP client 
requires a specific IPv4 address, you must reserve the address. 
Will a DHCP server supply IPv4 addresses to multiple subnets?  
If so, each subnet must contain a DHCP relay agent. If a subnet does not have a DHCP relay 
agent, you must install a separate DHCP server on the subnet. 
How many DHCP servers do you require?  
To ensure fault tolerance for DHCP configuration, you should use at least two DHCP servers. You 
might need additional DHCP servers for branch offices of a large organization.

communicate with DHCP clients. 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

The DHCP server cannot be a DHCP client. It must have a manually configured IPv4 address, subnet 
mask, and default gateway address on all of its LAN interfaces. 
DHCP and Active Directory Integration 
The DHCP Server service is integrated with Active Directory to provide authorization for DHCP servers. 
An unauthorized DHCP server on a network can disrupt network operations by allocating incorrect 
addresses or configuration options. A DHCP server that is a domain controller or a member of an Active 
Directory domain queries Active Directory for the list of authorized servers (identified by IPv4 address). 
If its own IPv4 address is not in the list of authorized DHCP servers, the DHCP Server service does not 
complete its startup sequence and automatically shuts down.  
For a DHCP server that is not a member of the Active Directory domain, the DHCP Server service 
sends a broadcast DHCPInform message to request information about the root Active Directory domain
