### Secure CPU, Storage, and Network Virtualization in Cloud Environments

Secure CPU and storage virtualization are more mature technologies compared to secure network virtualization. This is particularly true when these technologies are implemented in a distributed manner, even across multiple data centers. A tenant's virtual machine (VM) or virtual disk (VD) can be hosted on any server or data center, and the quality of service, such as VM efficiency, VD size, and backup copies, should remain consistent regardless of the hosting location. The concepts of "in" and "out" for a tenant's VMs and VDs are well-defined, making it straightforward to label them with the tenant's identity.

#### Network Virtualization: Challenges and Solutions

**Challenges:**

1. **Traditional Firewall Limitations:**
   - Traditional firewalls define "in" and "out" based on IP/MAC addresses.
   - In cloud environments, VMs are managed by hypervisors, which still rely on IP/MAC addresses for network control.
   - This non-virtualized approach leads to poor quality of service (QoS) and lack of distribution, especially in trans-datacenter scenarios.

2. **Quality of Service (QoS) Issues:**
   - **Problem 1 (Poor QoS, minor):** Communications between two VMs in a slave data center must pass through a master data center, reducing LAN bandwidth.
   - **Problem 2 (Lack of Distribution, very serious):** Moving out of the master data center requires redeploying and reconfiguring the entire VPN, effectively negating the benefits of distribution.

**Solution Proposal:**

To address these challenges, we propose a completely distributed and virtualized firewall that works on VM identities rather than just IP/MAC addresses.

**Key Components:**

1. **Identity Verification:**
   - Hypervisors use public-key cryptography to verify the identity (e.g., UUID) of VMs.
   - This verification is global, allowing hypervisors to verify VM identities across different data centers.

2. **Virtual Firewall Policy:**
   - Tenants create a list of global VM identities and specify communication policies.
   - This list serves as the virtual firewall policy, which can be distributed across multiple data centers.

3. **Distributed Control:**
   - Hypervisors consult the tenant's distributed virtual firewall list to control communications between VMs.
   - This ensures that the firewall is fully virtualized, both within and across data centers.

**Advantages:**

- **VM Mobility:** VMs can move between data centers without affecting the firewall policy, as it is based on unchanging VM identities.
- **Complete Distribution:** No need for a master data center; all traffic is controlled locally, improving QoS.
- **Security:** Traffic between VMs can be encrypted, enhancing security for multi-tenancy.
- **Genuineness Verification:** PKI-based IDs allow DNS to verify the authenticity of web servers, aiding in anti-phishing efforts.
- **Automation and Self-Service:** Tenant-defined firewall policies can be easily programmed and automated, enabling self-service.

**Conclusion:**

The journey to mature this new network virtualization technology will be long and will require collaboration among industry, academia, and R&D communities. By working together, we can make this innovative and useful network virtualization technology for secure multi-tenancy in cloud computing a reality.
