The rules for struct identity require that two identical structs have
identical tags.
This plays into the rules for assignments and conversions of structs in
unfortunate ways:
There appears to be no way to assign or even convert a struct with tags to
another struct with different or no tags, wether that other struct is named or
unnamed:

I think we're overly restrictive here. For instance, if I wanted to convert a
struct with json tags to a struct with tags for some other encoding (to
convert from one encoding to another), I actually have to copy all the fields
by hand.
This seems counter-intuitive. I would have expected that I could go via an
unnamed struct, or at the very least use an explicit conversion.
I'm thinking that perhaps we should relax the rules here. One might be to
remove again the requirement of identical tags for struct identity (simplest);
or perhaps to relax the rules for assignments and conversions of structs.
