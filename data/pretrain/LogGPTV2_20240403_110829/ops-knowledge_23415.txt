User: How to find the abnormal traffic and requests sent by the attacked server?
Assistant: To find abnormal traffic and requests from the attacked server, take the following steps: 1. Monitor network traffic. Packets entering and leaving the server can be detected using a traffic monitoring tool such as Wireshark etc. By analyzing these packets, it is possible to look for unusual traffic and determine their origin and destination. 2. Check the server's log. The server typically records log data of all access and activity. By examining the log files, you can see if your server has been attacked and determine the type and source of the attack. When in doubt, consult the documentation for your operating system and server to learn how to view and analyze log data. 3. Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems can monitor network traffic and alert on abnormal traffic. With these tools, attacks can be detected in time and prevented from causing further damage. 4. Analyze programs and services on the server. Attackers may exploit software vulnerabilities on the server to carry out their attacks. Examining the programs and services running on the server can identify vulnerabilities or unusual activity. If abnormalities are found, software and services should be updated in time, or unnecessary services should be disabled. In short, to find the abnormal traffic and requests sent by the attacked server, it is necessary to adopt a variety of monitoring and analysis methods, and to identify and prevent attacks in time.
