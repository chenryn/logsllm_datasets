User:  How to troubleshoot the problem that the DNS server cannot resolve the domain name?
Assistant: 1. Check your network connection: Check if your computer can connect to the Internet and access other websites. 2. Check the DNS server settings: Check if the computer’s DNS server settings are correct, usually the DNS server should be the same as your Internet service provider’s DNS server, or you can use a public DNS service, such as Google Public DNS or OpenDNS. 3. Confirm that the domain name is correct: Make sure there are no typos or typos in the domain name you entered. 4. Check the DNS cache: If you have visited the domain name before, the DNS records for the domain name may already be cached on your computer. You can try to clear the DNS cache and access the domain name again. 5. Confirm whether the DNS server is normal: try to use other computers to access the domain name, and check whether there is the same problem. If the other computers are fine, then there may be a problem with the DNS server in your computer. 6. Try to use other DNS servers: Try to use other DNS servers for resolution, such as Google Public DNS or OpenDNS, etc. 7. Check if the domain name is blocked: Some domain names may be blocked or blocked by a firewall, you can try to use a proxy server or VPN to bypass these blocks.
