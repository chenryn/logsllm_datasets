User: Is there a way to poll the cp command to get its current progress? I understand there's a modified/Advanced copy utility that adds a small little ASCII progress bar, but I want to build my own progress bar using led lights and whatnot, and need to be able to see the current percentage of the file activity in order to determine how many LEDs to light up on the progress bar.
Assistant: you can use rsync, which can be used pretty much like cp is used, but offers an option for progress indicator. It is sent to standard out, and you ought to be able to intercept it for your own fancies.
