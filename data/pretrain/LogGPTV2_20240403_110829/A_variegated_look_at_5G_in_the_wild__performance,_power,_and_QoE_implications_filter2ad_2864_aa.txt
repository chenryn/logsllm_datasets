## Abstract

Motivated by the rapid deployment of 5G, we conducted an in-depth measurement study to evaluate the performance, power consumption, and application quality-of-experience (QoE) of commercial 5G networks. Our study examines various 5G carriers, deployment schemes (Non-Standalone, NSA vs. Standalone, SA), radio bands (mmWave and sub-6 GHz), protocol configurations (e.g., Radio Resource Control state transitions), mobility patterns (stationary, walking, driving), client devices (i.e., User Equipment), and upper-layer applications (file download, video streaming, and web browsing). Our findings reveal key characteristics of commercial 5G in terms of throughput, latency, handover behaviors, radio state transitions, and radio power consumption under diverse scenarios, with detailed comparisons to 4G/LTE networks. Furthermore, our study provides insights into how upper-layer applications can best utilize 5G by balancing the tradeoff between performance and energy consumption, as well as by considering the availability of both network and computational resources. We have released the datasets and tools of our study at https://github.com/SIGCOMM21-5G/artifact.

## 1 Introduction

The 5G New Radio (NR) specifications [20] open a wide spectrum of frequencies. High-band millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G, along with its mid-/low-band sub-6 GHz counterpart, constitutes the current 5G market. We focus on mmWave 5G due to its ultra-high bandwidth, which is essential for emerging bandwidth-hungry applications. However, mmWave is highly sensitive to factors such as mobility and blockage due to its shorter wavelength, making upper-layer network management (e.g., bitrate adaptation for video streaming) more challenging. Despite numerous studies on modeling and simulation of mmWave links [27, 29, 34, 35, 50, 67, 68, 70], the impact of mmWave on commercial 5G performance, power consumption, and mobile application Quality-of-Experience (QoE) remains largely unexplored.

In addition to its high bandwidth and low latency enabled by physical-layer innovations (e.g., massive MIMO, advanced channel coding), power saving is a top concern for mobile users. In cellular networks, this is typically achieved through different Radio Resource Control (RRC) states. 5G follows this trend, and understanding the RRC state machine of commercial 5G networks and its implications is crucial. Most carriers initially deploy 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, which uses 5G for data plane operations while reusing the existing 4G infrastructure for control plane operations, making the RRC state machine 4G-like. Recently, Standalone (SA) 5G deployment has become commercially available. SA is independent of the legacy 4G infrastructure, fully realizing the potential of 5G. The configuration of key parameters in the state machine leads to important performance and energy trade-offs, which are often carrier-specific and differ between NSA and SA modes.

To understand the end-to-end performance and power characteristics of commercial 5G networks and their QoE implications on mobile applications, we conducted a comprehensive and in-depth measurement study of two commercial 5G networks in the US. As 5G technology evolves, its performance is expected to improve over time. We compare our measurement results with earlier studies to gain initial longitudinal insights into 5G's evolution. We also compare our findings on mmWave with its low-band counterpart. Our study faced several challenges:

- **Heterogeneous Ecosystem:** 5G-NR supports a wide range of frequency spectra: low-band, mid-band, and mmWave, each with different performance and signal propagation characteristics. Additionally, 5G can be deployed in either SA or NSA mode, which further impacts performance [30]. Conducting a measurement study in such a heterogeneous ecosystem is challenging.
- **Sporadic Coverage:** The coverage of different bands and deployment modes is often sporadic. For example, mmWave, with poor signal propagation, is mostly deployed outdoors. Surveying the availability of band-specific 5G service requires extensive field experiments.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Evaluating mobile carriers' end-to-end network performance in the wild is difficult. Many entities can become performance bottlenecks, including the Internet, mobile carrier infrastructure, and end devices. Identifying the bottleneck in mmWave 5G is particularly challenging due to its ultra-high bandwidth.
- **Power Measurement:** 5G power measurement is not trivial. State-of-the-art hardware power monitors often require a stable external power supply, making mobility experiments difficult. Additionally, vendors integrate the battery and back cover with the main body of smartphones, requiring skilled engineering to connect them to a power monitor.
- **Comparative Analysis:** To understand the benefits and new challenges of 5G, fair comparisons with the 4G baseline are necessary. However, 4G and 5G have very different characteristics, making it difficult to compare them in a fair, efficient, and representative way.

To address these challenges, we built a holistic testbed consisting of commercial 5G smartphones, external power monitors, and cloud servers. We developed software and hardware tools to control workloads and physical environments and log important information at different layers in a fine-grained manner. Through carefully designed experiments, we demystify the current 5G performance, power, and QoE implications, with a special emphasis on mmWave. Our experiments over a 4-month period consumed more than 15 TB of cellular data. The key contributions of our study are summarized as follows:

- **Detailed Performance Examination:** We performed a detailed performance examination of 5G over multiple frequency bands, including sub-6 GHz and mmWave. We found that both throughput and latency have improved compared to initial deployments. End-to-end performance is highly correlated with geographical properties, and we quantified these properties and their different impacts on NSA and SA 5G. We conducted experiments over T-Mobile's SA 5G deployed for their low-band network, which, to our knowledge, is the first examination of commercial SA 5G performance.
- **RRC State Inference:** Through principled probing algorithms, we inferred the RRC states and configuration parameters for SA 5G (T-Mobile) and NSA 5G (Verizon and T-Mobile). For NSA 5G, which relies on 4G as an anchor, we found that the NR_RRC_CONNECTED to LTE_RRC_IDLE state transition (due to data inactivity on UE) for the carriers in our study is 2× more energy-efficient than those studied in a previous NSA 5G measurement study [59].
- **Power Characteristics:** We examined the power characteristics of 5G and 4G/LTE. Over downlink (uplink), 5G can be 79% (74%) less energy-efficient than 4G at low throughput but up to 5× (2×) more energy-efficient when the throughput is high. Using a data-driven approach, we built a first throughput and signal strength-aware radio power model for different frequency bands of 5G.
- **Adaptive Video Bitrate Adaptation (ABR):** We conducted the first evaluation of state-of-the-art adaptive video bitrate adaptation (ABR) algorithms over mmWave 5G, which is the key radio technology for supporting ultra-high definition (UHD) videos and beyond. We found that due to the poor signal propagation characteristics of mmWave 5G, existing ABR mechanisms can incur ∼3.7% to 259.5% higher stall time than 4G/LTE. We proposed simple yet effective interface selection mechanisms for 5G video streaming, yielding a 26.9% reduction in video stall time and a 4.2% improvement in energy efficiency without compromising user-perceived video quality.
- **Web Page Load Time and Energy Consumption:** We collected a large dataset consisting of more than 30,000 web page loadings of diverse websites and used it to compare mmWave 5G vs. 4G page load time and energy consumption. We found that overall, 5G improves page load time at the cost of higher energy consumption compared to 4G. Moreover, this impact is highly web-page-dependent. We built decision tree models that can intelligently select the appropriate network (5G or 4G) for web browsing.
- **Released Artifacts:** We have released the functional artifacts (both datasets and tools) of our study: https://github.com/SIGCOMM21-5G/artifact.

**Ethical Considerations:** This study was carried out by paid and volunteer students. No personally identifiable information (PII) was collected or used, nor were any human subjects involved. We purchased multiple unlimited cellular data plans from Verizon and T-Mobile. Our study complies with the wireless carriers' customer agreements and does not raise any ethical issues.

## 2 Measurement Settings & Tools

### 5G Carriers, 5G Bands, and Locations

Since its commercial launch, the 5G ecosystem, including service deployments, coverage, and 5G-capable devices, is rapidly expanding and evolving. In our measurement study, we selected two commercial carriers in the US for our experiments: Verizon and T-Mobile. While both carriers have deployed 5G services on several bands, our dataset shows that Verizon has deployed NSA-based 5G service providing both mmWave 5G over 28/39 GHz frequency bands (n261/n260) and low-band 5G (n5) using dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology. In contrast, T-Mobile provides low-band (@ 600MHz or n71) 5G service using both NSA and SA modes. The measurement study was conducted in two US cities where both carriers have deployed 5G services. Key statistics of the datasets collected are summarized in Table 1.

### 5G UE and Android Measurement Tool

We used multiple smartphone models with 5G support: Google Pixel 5 (PX5), Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G (S20U), and Samsung Galaxy S10 5G (S10). These phones have diverse specifications. For instance, compared to PX5, S20U has a superior chipset, 5G modem, increased RAM, and CPU frequencies. We made considerable additions to 5G Tracker [41] and built a comprehensive monitoring toolkit with various functions to monitor network traffic, battery status (current and voltage), signal strength, etc. Some of these functions required rooting the phones. We used both rooted and non-rooted phones based on the needs to measure various aspects of 5G performance and power usage under different settings.

### Power Monitoring Tool

We used the Monsoon Power Monitor [17] to power smartphones and measure power consumption. For outdoor walking experiments, we used a portable external power source to supply power to the monitor.

## 3 Improvements and New Findings in 5G Network Performance

In this section, we closely examine the end-to-end network performance of commercial 5G networks by conducting several carefully designed experiments in the wild.

### 3.1 Measurement Methodology

**Challenges:**

- **Internet-Side Congestion:** First, Internet-side congestion can adversely affect network performance, making it challenging to isolate and measure the true performance of 5G networks.
- **Mobility and Signal Propagation:** Second, the sensitivity of mmWave to mobility and signal blockage complicates the measurement process, especially in real-world scenarios.
- **Device and Network Variability:** Third, the variability in device capabilities and network configurations across different carriers and locations adds complexity to the measurement and analysis.

By addressing these challenges, we aim to provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of 5G performance, power consumption, and QoE in real-world conditions.
