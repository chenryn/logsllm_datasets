### Title: Black Hat US-22: Exploiting the Early Launch Antimalware Ecosystem

**Abstract:**

The Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) feature in Windows provides robust anti-tampering mitigations, allowing security vendors to declare a Microsoft-approved list of explicitly allowed signers for Protected Process Light (PPL) services. Microsoft categorizes ELAM and PPL as "defense-in-depth security features," emphasizing that these mitigations are best-effort attempts to prevent security product tampering.

This presentation aims to highlight why these mitigations are only "best-effort" and ultimately indefensible. We will present a methodology for assessing ELAM drivers and demonstrate scenarios where overly permissive rules create opportunities for adversaries to exploit intended functionality, rather than vulnerabilities. A single, overly permissive ELAM driver can enable an adversary to tamper with security products and provide malware with anti-tampering protections, thereby hindering detection and remediation efforts.

The talk will conclude with a live demonstration of gaining user-mode code execution through an abusable, signed executable running with an antimalware-light protection level. This will illustrate how the abuse of ELAM's intended functionality can be leveraged by malicious actors.
