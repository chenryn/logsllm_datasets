### 1.2.1 Targeted Attacks and Out-of-Band (OOB) Security Bulletins

Targeted attacks often exploit vulnerabilities that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. Microsoft typically addresses such vulnerabilities through out-of-band (OOB) security bulletins. One notable exception was the OOB Security Bulletin released to address an information disclosure vulnerability in ASP.NET. This vulnerability was publicly disclosed by security researchers Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong at the Ekoparty security conference in Buenos Aires. At the end of their presentation, they distributed three USB flash drives containing documentation of the vulnerability and a working exploit to the audience.

Oracle follows a quarterly patching cycle through the release of Critical Patch Updates (CPUs). Historically, Oracle has released CPUs on the Tuesday closest to the 15th day of the quarterly month. In 2010, Oracle issued two out-of-cycle security alerts. The first addressed a trivially exploitable vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server, which could allow a malicious actor to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary commands without any user interaction. The second alert responded to the public disclosure of two vulnerabilities in Sun Java, which could enable malicious actors to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system by social engineering the victim into viewing a malicious website. Prior to 2010, the last out-of-cycle security alert was in July 2008 for a buffer overflow vulnerability in xine-lib, affecting multiple vendors.

Cisco employs a semiannual scheduled patching cycle, occurring on the fourth Wednesday of March and September, specifically for Cisco IOS, the operating system powering Cisco's routers and network switches. In 2009, Cisco released three IOS out-of-cycle security bulletins, despite no reports of exploitation. On January 20, 2010, Cisco issued a single security advisory outside its regular schedule to fix a memory exhaustion vulnerability in IOS that could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. However, Cisco argued that this did not qualify as an OOB release since it did not meet the company's criteria for such releases.

A month after Adobe's first scheduled quarterly patch release for Acrobat and Reader on June 9, 2009, Adobe released its first out-of-cycle security bulletin in late July 2009 to address a PDF vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Similar to the vulnerabilities fixed by Microsoft, the four vulnerabilities Adobe addressed out-of-band were either exploits or malware used in targeted attacks, with one exception: an integer overflow vulnerability revealed at the Black Hat 2010 conference in Las Vegas, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted host.

### 1.2.2 Changing Vulnerability Disclosure Landscape

The vulnerability disclosure landscape underwent significant changes over the year. The introduction of multiple vendor bounty programs, increased standard payments for vulnerabilities, and the adoption of coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) reinvigorated relationships between security researchers and vendors.

In early 2010, Google announced a cash reward program for bugs and vulnerabilities found in Chrome. This program, similar to Mozilla's Firefox bounty program, faced criticism for offering relatively small rewards. Security researchers could often earn more by selling their findings to brokers. Mid-year, Mozilla raised its bounty for critical vulnerabilities to up to $3,000 USD. Google quickly followed suit, offering up to $3,133.73 USD, thus initiating a bidding war for researchers' efforts and raising the industry standard for vulnerability payments.

This price increase reflected a shift in vendors' approach to vulnerability research. Vendors now recognize that vulnerabilities and bugs are no longer free and are providing real financial incentives to security researchers. This change has transformed the relationship between security researchers and vendors from a one-way street to a mutually beneficial partnership. For example, the number of bugs and vulnerabilities submitted to Google has significantly increased since the bounty increase.

Microsoft introduced a new form of responsible disclosure called "coordinated vulnerability disclosure" (CVD). CVD builds on the principles of responsible disclosure but emphasizes coordination between vendors and discoverers, timely responses from vendors, and public disclosure only in the event of active attacks, focusing on mitigation and workarounds. This approach was developed in response to the debate between responsible and full disclosure. Responsible disclosure allows vendors to patch vulnerabilities before public awareness, but it can also lead to delays, allowing attackers to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. Full disclosure, while providing detailed information to malicious users, can also prompt immediate preventive action and pressure vendors to develop fixes quickly.

Tavis Ormandy, a security researcher for Google, publicly disclosed a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Windows on the Full Disclosure mailing list on June 10, 2010. Microsoft acknowledged the vulnerability the same day and reiterated its support for responsible disclosure. The Google Security Team responded with a blog post discussing the benefits and shortcomings of both disclosure models.

### 1.2.3 Vendor Bounty Programs

#### 1.2.3.1 Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program

Mozilla initiated its bug bounty program in August 2004, offering $500 USD and a T-shirt for reporting critical security bugs in Thunderbird and Firefox. In July 2010, the bounty was increased to $3,000 USD, reflecting the evolving cyber landscape and the "No more free bugs" movement, which advocated for compensating security researchers for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Lucas Adamski, Mozilla's security engineering director, believed that increasing the compensation would improve relations with security researchers and encourage responsible disclosure, thereby enhancing the safety of Mozilla products.

The higher compensation has the potential to drive more high-quality bug reports, though it is too early to fully assess the program's effectiveness. Since the increase, the number of reported vulnerabilities has risen slightly, but this may also be due to the overall increase in existing vulnerabilities over the years.

#### 1.2.3.2 Google Security Bug Bounty Program

Google launched a similar program, offering $500 USD for general vulnerabilities and $1,337 USD for severe ones. The program initially faced criticism for low payouts. In the first six months, 21 bugs were reported, with one classified as "leet." Following Mozilla's bounty increase, Google raised its maximum payout to $3,133.73 USD, leading to a significant increase in reported vulnerabilities. The addition of the sandbox feature in Chrome makes it more challenging for researchers to find high-severity vulnerabilities, requiring more time and effort. Google justifies the high bounty by the extensive work involved in researching these bugs.

On November 1, 2010, Google announced an experimental bounty program for Google Web properties, including .google.com, .youtube.com, .blogger.com, and .orkut.com. The program will extend to client-based applications like Android, Picasa, and Google Desktop in the future. Despite initial challenges, the increased bounty has led to a quadrupling of $1,337 USD bounties, indicating that more researchers are dedicating time to finding high-quality bugs in Chrome.

### 2. Disruptors

#### 2.1 Introduction

In 1997, Clayton Christensen published "The Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma," where he introduced the concept of disruptive technology. These innovations fundamentally change how an industry serves its customer base, sometimes causing established businesses to fail if they do not adapt quickly enough. Disruptive technologies are not merely enhancements but radical, innovative solutions that initially appear to serve a niche market but eventually dominate the industry.

Christensen uses the example of the size reduction of computer disk drives to illustrate his point. From the 1960s to the 1990s, hard drives underwent repeated design innovations. Each reduction in size, such as the transition from 8-inch to 5.25-inch floppy drives, disrupted the market, causing some dominant manufacturers to fail because they did not anticipate the demand for smaller drives.

In 2007, iDefense introduced the concept of the cyber security disruptor, identifying new ideas, technologies, government policies, or events that could fundamentally change how organizations protect their cyber assets over the next 5-10 years. Since then, iDefense analysts have identified several disruptive catalysts, each representing a technology, law, or forecasted event that will significantly alter the security community.

Consider the timeline in Exhibit 2-1. The far right outlines predictions 10 years into the future, marking the event horizon when iDefense begins tracking innovations. The far left represents the past (2005 and prior), where current best practices, such as firewalls, anti-virus engines, and intrusion detection systems (IDS), are well-established and industry-accepted solutions.
