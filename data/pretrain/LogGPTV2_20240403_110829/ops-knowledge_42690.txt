User: My rough understanding is that Redis is better if you need the in-memory key-value store feature, however I am not sure how that has anything to do with distributing tasks?
Does that mean we should use Redis as a message broker IF we are already using it for something else?
Assistant: The Redis broker gives tasks to workers in a fair round robin between different queues. Rabbit is FIFO always. For me, a fair round robin was preferable and I tried both. Rabbit seems a tad more stable though.
