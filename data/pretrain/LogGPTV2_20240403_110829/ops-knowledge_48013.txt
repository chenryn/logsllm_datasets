User: I use Debian + Nginx + Django + UWSGI.
One of my function us fork() in the file view.py (the fork works well), then immediately written return render (request, ...
After the fork() the page loads for a long time and after that browser prints error - "Web page not available». On the other hand the error doesn’t occur if i reload the page during loading (because i don’t launch the fork() again).
The documentation UWSGI there is -

uWSGI tries to (ab)use the Copy On Write semantics of the fork() call whenever possible. By default it will fork after having loaded your applications to share as much of their memory as possible. If this behavior is undesirable for some reason, use the lazy-apps option. This will instruct uWSGI to load the applications after each worker’s fork(). Beware as there is an older options named lazy that is way more invasive and highly discouraged (it is still here only for backward compatibility)

I do not understand everything, and I wrote in a configuration option uWSGI lazy-apps: lazy-apps: 1 in my uwsgi.yaml.
It does not help that I'm wrong?
What do I do with this problem?
P.S. other options besides fork() is that I do not fit ..
PP.S. Sorry, I used google translate ..
Assistant: use lazy-apps = true instead of 1
