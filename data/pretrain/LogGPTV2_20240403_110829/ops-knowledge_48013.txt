Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I am using Debian, Nginx, Django, and uWSGI. In my `views.py` file, I have a function that uses `fork()`, which works correctly. However, immediately after the `fork()`, I call `return render(request, ...)`.

After the `fork()`, the page takes a long time to load, and eventually, the browser displays an error: "Web page not available." Interestingly, this error does not occur if I reload the page during the loading process, as the `fork()` is not executed again in that case.

According to the uWSGI documentation:

> uWSGI tries to (ab)use the Copy On Write semantics of the `fork()` call whenever possible. By default, it will fork after having loaded your applications to share as much of their memory as possible. If this behavior is undesirable for some reason, use the `lazy-apps` option. This will instruct uWSGI to load the applications after each worker's `fork()`. Beware, there is an older option named `lazy` that is more invasive and highly discouraged (it is still here only for backward compatibility).

I did not fully understand the documentation, so I added the `lazy-apps: 1` option to my `uwsgi.yaml` configuration. However, this did not resolve the issue. What might I be doing wrong, and how can I address this problem?

P.S. I need to use `fork()` in my application, so other options are not suitable.
PP.S. Apologies, I used Google Translate for this message.

**Additional Note:** Instead of `lazy-apps: 1`, try using `lazy-apps: true` in your `uwsgi.yaml` configuration.

This version should be clearer, more coherent, and professionally presented.
