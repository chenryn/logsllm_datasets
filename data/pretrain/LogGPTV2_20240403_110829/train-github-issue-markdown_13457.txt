It seems with the newest update v15 when passing props into a child component
with the spread operator the console throws the warnings associated with this
pull request.
seems to only throw issue when the component is not a class but only stateless
component hence passing just {...props} and not {...this.props}

I am not accessing refs or keys in the child component
