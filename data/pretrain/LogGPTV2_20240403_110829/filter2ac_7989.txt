To adhere to the principle of least privilege, organizations should restrict the permissions for creating new instances. Specifically, this involves:

- Limiting the number of users with administrative privileges within the organization.
- Reducing all permanent privileged role assignments.
- Conducting periodic entitlement reviews for IAM (Identity and Access Management) users, roles, and policies.

By implementing these measures, organizations can enhance their security posture and minimize the risk of unauthorized access or actions.
