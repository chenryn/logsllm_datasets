Furthermore, station capacities are now 𝐹1 = 5, 𝐹2 =
𝐹3 = 𝐹4 = 𝐹5 = 𝑁 so that only station 1 has ﬁnite
capacity. The population is 𝑁 = 10 jobs. Service processes
are again identical short-range dependent MAPs. The results in
Figure 4 indicate that the bounds are very effective in capturing
the performance of the ﬁnite capacity queue 1, while more
uncertainty is left on queues 2−5 where the gap between upper
and lower bounds is approximately up to 20%. In spite of such
uncertainty, MEM and MMI again ﬁnd very accurate results,
again within a few percent of the exact results, with MMI
again being slightly better than MEM. This is a relevant result,
since despite its apparent simplicity, the number of possible
combinations of m vectors is 64 for each state in which queue
1 is full, which is signiﬁcant. Hence, this experiment suggests
that the MEM and MMI approximation are effective also on
cases where the portion of the state-space due to the BAS
precedence constraints is non-negligible.

where queue 1 feeds parallel stations. We assume 𝑀 = 5,

This is a case where we compare approximations and bounds
under multiple RS-RD blocking. We see in Figure 3 that
the upper and lower bounds (“ub” and “lb”, respectively)
are not able to generate a tight envelope around the exact
utilization and exact effective utilizations (“ex”). However,
both MEM and MMI return almost perfect results within
less than 2% utilization. Similarly to the toy example, MMI
appears slightly more effective than MEM for capturing the
probability distribution. Notice also that the MEM solution is
slightly affected by numerical perturbations due to the fully
symmetric routing of this network.

Station 1 has MAP service (24), all other stations are exponen-
tial. All mean service times are equal to 1, expect for queue
5 where it is 3.333. Station 5 is also the only ﬁnite capacity
queue with capacity 𝐹5 = 3. Figure 5 reports experimental
results. We see again that the proposed approximations are
very effective, however this illustrates a case where also the
bounds are very tight, and one may for instance take their
middle point as a ﬁrst approximation of the exact value of the
utilizations. Quite interestingly, this shows a case where station
1 has a dramatic difference between utilization and effective
utilization, due to the blocking on queue 5. This is perfectly
captured by the proposed techniques.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a major extension of
MAP queueing network models to support BAS and RS-
RD blocking mechanisms. Based on the recently proposed
Quadratic Reduction (QR) technique [5], we have described
the state space with a set of marginal probabilities having car-
dinality that is much smaller than for the original state space.
Then, we have derived new exact characterization results that
describe the relations between such marginal probabilities in
the context of BAS and RS-RD blocking. Using a numerical
optimization approach, we have derived boundable approxima-
tions on performance metrics based on the maximum entropy
and minimum mutual
information principles. Experimental
results indicate that such approximations are highly accurate.
Possible extensions of this work include considering additional
blocking mechanisms and the generalization of the proposed
techniques to queueing networks that
the maximum
number of jobs within a subnetwork, which are important to
model admission control mechanisms.
