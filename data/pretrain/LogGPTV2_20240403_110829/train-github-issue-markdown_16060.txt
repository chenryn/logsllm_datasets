The Visual Studio Online workbench on Azure provides a convenient PowerShell terminal, enabling users to work with their cloud-based environments seamlessly. Similarly, other mature Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) also include terminal windows in their workbenches. This feature allows users to execute commands interactively without needing to switch between their desktop and the IDE window.
