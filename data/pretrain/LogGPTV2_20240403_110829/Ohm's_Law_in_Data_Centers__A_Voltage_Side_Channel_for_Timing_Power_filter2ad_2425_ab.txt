meanwhile also leaves data centers vulnerable to malicious power
attacks that result in more frequent and costly power outages.
2.2.1 Current safeguards. First of all, a data center operator lever-
ages infrastructure redundancy to handle random system failures
[31]. Depending on the level of redundancy, data centers are classi-
fied into four tiers, from Tier-I that has no redundancy to Tier-IV
that duplicates all power/cooling systems (so-called “2N” redun-
dancy) [31, 32]. While a power attack may not lead to an actual
power outage due to infrastructure redundancies, such redundancy
protection is compromised due to malicious power loads, exposing
the impacted data center in a very dangerous situation. For instance,
with power attacks, the outage risk for a fully-redundant Tier-IV
data center increases by 280+ times than otherwise [11, 31].
Moreover, since multi-tenant data center operators cannot con-
trol or arbitrarily cut tenants’ power usage (unless a tenant is found
in violation of the contract), they typically impose contractual con-
straints on each tenant’s continuous power usage (limited to 80% of
a tenant’s subscribed power capacity), while only allowing tenants
to use up their full power capacity occasionally [11, 23]. By doing
so, the tenants’ aggregate power usage can stay below the actual
power infrastructure capacity at almost all times. Nonetheless, these
safeguards are highly vulnerable to well-timed power attacks that
are launched at moments when tenants’ power usage is also high
(see Fig. 13 for illustration) [8, 11].
In addition, tenants themselves may employ software-based fault
tolerance to withstand power outages. Nonetheless, power outages
can induce correlated server failures that are challenging to survive
through [33]. For example, even a power outage in a single facility
cost Delta Airlines over 150 million U.S. dollars [1].
The above discussion highlights that, despite several safeguards,
multi-tenant data centers are still highly vulnerable to (well-timed)
power attacks [8, 11].
2.2.2 Cost impact of power attacks. While not every power attack
can lead to an actual outage, power attacks result in more frequent
capacity overloads and hence significantly compromise the data
center availability over a long term. For example, the outage risk
for a fully-redundant Tier-IV data center increases by 280+ times
than otherwise [11, 31]. Based on a conservative estimate [8], even
2.3 Recent Works on Timing Power Attacks
In a multi-tenant data center, a key challenge for an attacker is
that the actual attack opportunity lasts intermittently (Fig. 13 in
Section 5.2). For timing power attacks in a multi-tenant data center,
the prior research has considered a thermal side channel (due to the
heat recirculation resulting from servers’ heat) [11] and an acoustic
side channel (due to noise propagation from servers’ cooling fan
noise) [8]. Nonetheless, as confirmed by our discussion with a large
data center operator, they suffer from the following limitations.
First, both the thermal and acoustic side channels utilize air as
the medium. Hence, they have only a limited range (e.g., 5 ∼ 10
meters) and are highly sensitive to disturbances (e.g., supply cold
air temperature and human voice disturbances). Moreover, because
it takes time (1 minute or even longer) for server heat to reach the
attacker’s temperature sensor and for server’s cooling fans to react
to server power changes, these side channels cannot provide real-
time information about benign tenants’ power usage. In addition,
exploiting a thermal side channel requires an accurate modeling of
heat recirculation, whereas the acoustic side channel needs complex
signal processing techniques to mitigate near-far effects (i.e., the
attacker’s received noise level is dominate by its neighbors) [8].
Last but not least, the thermal side channel requires a raised-floor
data center layout without heat containment, whereas the acoustic
side channel requires servers have conventional fan speed controls.
In sharp contrast, a distinguishing feature of our discovered volt-
age side channel (Section 4.3) is that it is insensitive to external
disturbances (because of the wired power line transmission) and
can carry benign tenants’ power usage information throughout the
power network. The voltage side channel also provides real-time
information about benign tenants’ power usage (with a delay of 1
second for frequency analysis). More importantly, the voltage side
channel is based on the high-frequency voltage ripples generated
by PFC circuits that are universally built in servers’ power supply
units, and can be exploited without any specific models about the
data center power network. Finally, while the settings for our ex-
periments and [8, 11] are different, our results show that given 10%
attack time, the voltage side channel can achieve 80+% true positive
for detecting attack opportunities (Fig. 17(a)) whereas [8, 11] only
achieve around or below 50%. This translates into ∼2x successful
attacks by using our voltage side channel. Therefore, our voltage
side channel presents a more significant threat in real systems.
3 THREAT MODEL
As illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider a malicious tenant (i.e., attacker)
that houses its own physical servers in a multi-tenant data center,
sharing the power infrastructure with benign tenants.
Attacker’s capability. The attacker subscribes a fixed amount
of power capacity from the data center operator. It behaves normally
as benign tenants, except for its malicious intention to overload the
shared power infrastructure and create more power outages. Thus,
for stealthiness, the attacker only occasionally uses power up to its
capacity, which is allowed by the operator’s power usage contract
[23]. Physically tampering with the shared power infrastructure
or placing explosive devices can be easily found/detected and is
orthogonal to our work.
The attacker launches power attacks by running power-hungry
applications (e.g., computation to maximize CPU utilization) at
moments when the aggregate power usage of benign tenants is
sufficiently high. Note that the attacker may also remotely send
additional requests to benign tenants’ servers during power attacks
if benign tenants offer public services (e.g., video streaming). This
complementary attack method can further increase the aggregate
server power consumption. In this paper, we focus on attacks by
using the attacker’s own server power as in [8, 11].
To exploit a voltage side channel for timing power attacks, the
attacker acquires the supplied voltage by placing an analog-to-
digital converter (ADC) circuit inside the power supply unit (Fig. 4)
in one of its servers.1 The ADC samples the incoming continuous-
time voltage signals at a rate of 200kHz or above, and the sampled
voltage signals are stored for further processing (Section 4). Note
that in a multi-tenant data center, the attacker owns its physical
servers, instead of renting them from the data center operator.
Furthermore, while a multi-tenant data center has a more rigorous
inspection for tenants than a public cloud platform, the data center
operator will not disassemble tenant servers’ power supply units
during the routine inspection due to intrusiveness. Thus, a coin-size
or even smaller voltage ADC can be easily placed inside the power
supply unit before the attacker moves its servers into the target
multi-tenant data center. In modern power supply units, a high-
speed voltage ADC is already in place as part of the PFC design,
and in this case, the attacker can simply read the ADC’s output
without placing an additional ADC circuit.
Successful attack. Power attacks compromise the data center
availability over a long term. Thus, we consider a power attack
successful as long as the combined power usage of the attacker
and benign tenants continuously exceeds the power infrastructure
capacity for at least L minutes (e.g., L = 5 is enough to trip a circuit
[8, 34]), even though an actual outage does not occur due to infras-
tructure redundancy. Instead of targeting a specific tenant, power
attacks compromise the availability of shared power infrastructures
and hence significantly affect the normal operation of both data
center operator and benign tenants.
Other threat models for power attacks. Next, we highlight
the differences between our threat model and other relevant models
for power attacks.
1ADC circuits often operate over a low voltage range (e.g., 5V) and hence, a voltage
divider may be necessary to scale down the incoming voltage to an appropriate range.
• Power attacks in public clouds. Some studies [7, 9, 10] propose to
use malicious virtual machines (VMs) to create power overloads in
public clouds like Amazon. For tripping the circuit breaker and suc-
cessful attacks, the attacker needs to launch a large number of VMs
co-residing in the same PDU. Nonetheless, this is nontrivial and can
be difficult to accomplish in practice, because the cloud operator
frequently randomizes its VM placement (to prevent co-residency
side channel attacks [5, 35]). In addition, the cloud operator has
numerous knobs (e.g., CPU scaling) to throttle the VM power con-
sumption for defending its power infrastructure against a power
attack. More recently, [36] considers a related attack model but
aims at using VMs to generate excessive heat for overloading the
cooling capacity.
In contrast, our model focuses on a multi-tenant data center
where an attacker can house its own physical servers to inject
large power loads, tripping the circuit breaker of a shared PDU
more easily. The data center operator, as discussed in Section 2.2.1,
cannot control or forcibly cut a tenant’s power usage unless a tenant
violates its power contract.
Compared to using VMs for power attacks in a public cloud
[9, 10], an attacker in a multi-tenant data center can incur more
costs (e.g., for purchasing servers). At the same time, however,
power attacks in our model are also more devastating due to the
attacker’s capability of injecting large power loads on a single PDU.
Importantly, in our model, the attacker’s total cost is just a small
fraction (3% ∼ 16% in Section 5.2) of the resulting financial loss.
Moreover, while VMs can be launched remotely without revealing
the attacker’s identity [9, 10], it is also difficult to identify and/or
prosecute the attacker in our attack scenario, because: (1) data cen-
ter outages are caused by the operator’s capacity oversubscription
as well as the aggregate high power of multiple tenants; and (2) the
attacker does not violate any contractual constraints. Even though
its servers are detected, the attacker’s loss is minimum (e.g., only a
few servers) because it likely uses fake/counterfeit identities when
moving into the target data center. Finally, we focus on precise
timing of power attacks for stealthiness, while the crucial timing
issue is neglected in [9, 10].
• Power attacks in multi-tenant data centers. Our model builds
upon those considered in two recent studies [8, 11]. In these studies,
the attacker needs to install temperature sensors and microphones
in order to exploit a thermal side channel [11] and an acoustic side
channel [8], respectively, for timing power attacks. Both thermal
sensors and microphones are exposed to the outside of the servers
and hence may be detected more easily. In contrast, our model is
more stealthy as the attacker only places a small ADC circuit (if not
available yet) inside its server’s power supply unit, without exposing
any hardware to the outside. More comparisons (e.g., practical
limitations and timing accuracy) are provided in Section 2.3.
4 EXPLOITING A VOLTAGE SIDE CHANNEL
The key novelty of our work is to exploit a voltage side channel to
track benign tenants’ aggregate power usage at runtime for timing
power attacks in a multi-tenant data center.
Concretely, we discover that the PFC circuit inside each server’s
power supply unit is controlled by a switch to regulate the server’s
current draw for improving power factor. Because of the Ohm’s
Figure 2: Circuit of data center power distribution.
Law, this design creates high-frequency voltage ripples which, with-
out interference from the nominal 50/60Hz frequency of the gird
voltage, exist along the power lines supplying voltage to servers.
Thus, by sensing the supplied voltage and extracting the frequency
components associated with the ripples, the attacker can track
benign tenants’ power usage and launch well-timed power attacks.
4.1 Overview of the Power Network
Before presenting our voltage side channel, we show in Fig. 2 an
overview of the equivalent electrical circuit of a data center power
network, where one PDU delivers power to N servers. For better
understanding, we focus on a single-phase system that each serves
a few tens of servers and best represents an edge multi-tenant data
center (hosting workloads such as augmented reality and assisted
driving) [29, 37]. In Section 6, we will extend to more complex
three-phase systems used in large multi-tenant data centers.
total current flowing from UPS to PDU is denoted by I =˝N
As shown in Fig. 2, the PDU distributes alternating current (AC)
to servers using a parallel circuit. We denote the UPS output voltage
and the PDU voltage by VU PS and VP DU , respectively. The power
line connecting the UPS to the PDU has a resistance of R, and the
n=1 In,
where In is the current of server n. Without loss of generality, we let
server N be the one with attacker’s ADC circuit, while the attacker
can own multiple other servers. Thus, the voltage measured by the
attacker is denoted by VN .
Constraint on current measurement. Power is the product
of voltage and current, and servers operate at a relatively stable
voltage. Thus, had the attacker been able to sense the total current
n=1 In, it would know the aggregate power usage of all tenants
and easily time its power attacks. Due to the power line constraint,
however, the attacker can only measure the current flowing into
its own servers.
I =˝N
Line voltage drop. We observe that the voltage supplied to
each individual server is affected by all the servers. Concretely,
the current flowing from the UPS to PDU results in a voltage drop
∆V along the power line. The phenomenon of voltage drop is also
common in our daily life, e.g., dimming of a light when starting a
power-consuming appliance in the same house. Then, following
the Ohm’s Law, the voltage measured by the attacker is expressed
as VN = VU PS − I · R − IN · RN ≈ VU PS − I · R = VP DU , which can
