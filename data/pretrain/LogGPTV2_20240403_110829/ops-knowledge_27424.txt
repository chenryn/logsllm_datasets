User: How do I have to configure so that I don't have to type python script.py but simply script.py in CMD on Windows?
I added my python directory to %PATH% that contains python.exe but still scripts are not run correctly.
I tried it with django-admin.py Running django-admin.py startproject mysite gives me 
Type 'django-admin.py help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand. Using python in front of it processes the command correctly. 
What's the problem here?
Assistant: I also had the same issue...
I could fix it by re-associating *.py files with the python launcher.

Right click on a *.py file and open its properties.
Click on the Change button of the "Opens with..." section
Select More apps -> Look for another app on this PC.
Then browse to your windows folder (by default: "C:\Windows")
Select "py.exe"
