licious behavior. While others have investigated SMS content
and metadata in the context of SMS spam [46], [60], [61],
[75], this work is the ﬁrst to expansively measure how SMS
is used for security purposes by legitimate services. We note
that much of the research in this area has been forced to rely
on small datasets (some less than 2000 messages [61]). Mobile
two-factor authentication is increasing in popularity, with some
eagerly heralding its arrival [27] and others cautioning that it
may only provide a limited increase in security [63]. Much
of the data we collected contained mobile two-factor authen-
tication tokens sent over SMS. While SMS tokens are popular
in many contexts, including mobile banking and ﬁnance [62],
other approaches have been implemented in a variety of forms
including keychain fobs [7], [18], one-time pads [56], [64],
biometric scanners [31], [67], and mobile phones [10], [26],

Our emphasis on phone veriﬁed accounts provides a sep-
arate contribution. Thomas et al. study the effects of phone
veriﬁed accounts at Google [72]. While they use datasets of
purchased or disabled PVAs, we provide insight into PVA
fraud from enabling services. While we conﬁrm some of their
observations, our data indicated their recommendations may
prove ineffective at defeating PVA evasion.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Text messaging has become an important part of the se-
curity infrastructure. However,
this ecosystem has evolved
signiﬁcantly since its inception, and now includes a wide
range of devices and participants external to traditional cel-
lular providers. Public SMS gateways directly embody this
change, and allow us to not only observe at scale how a
range of providers are implementing security solutions via text
messages, but also provide us evidence of how assumptions
about SMS are being circumvented in the wild. While our data
may not fully encompass all communications sent over SMS,
our measurements identify a range of popular services whose
one-time messaging mechanisms should be improved, and
additional entities who may be creating new opportunities for
compromise by sending highly sensitive data (e.g., credit card
numbers) via these channels. On the abuse side, we see the
ease with which these gateways are being used to circumvent
authentication mechanisms, and show that previously proposed
mitigations to PVA fraud such as block banning are unlikely
to be successful
in practice. These measurements indicate
that all providers relying on SMS as an out of band channel
for authentication with strong ties to a user’s identity should
reevaluate their current solutions for this evolving space.
