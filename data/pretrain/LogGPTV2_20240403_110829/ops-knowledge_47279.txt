User: Please describe your software development process, including the work and considerations in each stage of requirements gathering, design, coding, testing and deployment.
Assistant: My software development process is roughly divided into the following stages: 1. Requirements Gathering Stage In this stage, I will communicate with customers or product managers to understand the requirements of the software project and determine its goals and scope. It is important to fully understand the customer's needs, which will help guide subsequent development efforts. I usually use some tool to organize and archive requirements, such as Miro or Trello. 2. In the design phase, based on understanding the requirements, I will start to design the software architecture. In order to ensure that the software can maintain the characteristics of clear structure, scalability, reusability and high maintainability during the development process, I usually use UML modeling tools to sort out various parts of the system. Modern systems use Docker, K8s and IaC to build tools, so a certain understanding of operation and maintenance is required. 3. Coding phase After the design is complete, I will start writing the code. Code quality, structure and comments are very important. In order to keep the code standard, I will use some tools, such as Prettier and ESLint for code formatting and style checking. In order to ensure the quality and correctness of the code, I will use some automation tools, such as Jest and Mocha, for unit testing and integration testing. 4. Testing phase After the development is complete, I will conduct testing. During testing, I verify that the code meets customer needs and test every possible scenario. Testing is divided into black-box and white-box testing. In white-box testing, I will use unit tests in the code to verify, while in black-box testing, I will check whether the system's functions and user interfaces are normal through manual testing. 5. Deployment phase After the test is completed, I will deploy the software. In order to ensure the security and stability of the software, I usually use automated deployment tools such as Jenkins and Docker to ensure that the software can run correctly in the production environment. Notes: - During the software development process, communicate and collaborate with the development team in a timely manner. - At various stages, testing and code review are essential. - Focus on user feedback and continuous improvement of products. - Document the development process for subsequent maintenance and upgrades. - Security and data protection are paramount. Reasonable encryption and protection measures are required for software.
