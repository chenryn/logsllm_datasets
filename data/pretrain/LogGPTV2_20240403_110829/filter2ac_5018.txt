**ATT&CK ID:** M1026  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

To enhance security and restrict the ability to increase the scheduling priority of processes, configure the "Increase Scheduling Priority" user right to be exclusive to the Administrators group. This setting can be managed through Group Policy Objects (GPO) by navigating to the following path:

- **Computer Configuration**
  - **Policies**
    - **Windows Settings**
      - **Security Settings**
        - **Local Policies**
          - **User Rights Assignment: Increase Scheduling Priority**

By limiting this privilege to the Administrators group, you ensure that only authorized users with elevated permissions can modify process priorities, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized or malicious actions. [187]
