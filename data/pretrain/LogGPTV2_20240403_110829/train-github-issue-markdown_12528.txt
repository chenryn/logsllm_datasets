I have a DAE model that previews fine in macOS Catalina with animation. Drag
and dropping into GLTF converter (https://blackthread.io/gltf-converter/)
shows the model but not the animation. Animations from a test FBX do show.
MacOS 10.15.1 DAE Preview (it is animating)

The same DAE file also loads properly into Cheetah3D with working animation.
