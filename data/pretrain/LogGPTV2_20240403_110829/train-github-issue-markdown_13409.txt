Using commit `7fbbfe6` I am experiencing this failure during `make check`:

Initially I thought it was because my OS (NixOS) did not install `env` in
/usr/bin (in fact, /usr doesn't even exist, but env is in the PATH), but even
then, that does not explain why other env tests succeed (such as
test_add_to_env, which is almost exactly the same code as test_override_env).
However, if I copy/paste the code from the test into a new program and run it,
it seems to work fine.
Furthermore, this exact `make check` failure seems to be repeatable, even
after updating to a newer commit and compiling everything from scratch.
This seems quite mysterious to me... any ideas as to what the problem might
be?
