I made tests a bit too verbose in #11616.  
Might be a good time to revisit how we write them now.
There's a few separate issues:
  * Asserting on warning messages is too verbose. Need a DEV block, call `spyOnDev`, normalize stack, etc. Ideally I wish there was a higher level helper that lets us "push" expected warning assertions and validate them as they happen. It should handle component stacks automatically without having to copy-paste the normalization helper everywhere.
  * In some cases I added actual duplication in #11616, in particular for cases that throw in development but don't throw in production. Maybe need a `toThrowInDev()`? Although on the other hand this pattern needs to be highly visible so maybe extracting common code in a closure is good enough.
