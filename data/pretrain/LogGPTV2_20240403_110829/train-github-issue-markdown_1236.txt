It is a common practice in scientific plottings that a barplot (or
violinplot/swarmplot) has statistical annotations such as p-values marked with
horizontal lines connecting the bars. There is already an implementation of
this as a separate project:  
https://github.com/webermarcolivier/statannot
but having such a feature incorporated into seaborn would be very handy. Is
there any interest to pursue this? -Thanks
