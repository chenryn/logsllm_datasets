Abstract‚ÄîWe present Sabre, a family of sender-anonymous
messaging protocols with instances supporting both Twitter-
like anonymous bulletin boards and Secure Drop-like mail-
boxes. Both variants provide strong anonymity while poten-
tially scaling to anonymity sets in the tens of millions and
beyond. Sabre protocols inherit their basic structure from
Riposte and Express while replacing those schemes‚Äô linear-
cost audit protocols with new logarithmic-cost ones. Sabre
also incorporates a host of innovations that improve concrete
performance by an order of magnitude or more under ‚Äúideal‚Äù
circumstances, while providing asymptotic speedups in the
face of resource exhaustion-style DoS attacks.
I. Introduction
The Internet was supposed to be a great equalizer; instead,
it has grown to be a great surveillance apparatus. Today,
netizens are routinely identified, tracked, profiled, censored,
and silenced by countless shadowy figures, organizations,
governments,
identity thieves‚Äîand even algorithms. Far
from the bastion of free speech espoused by the web‚Äôs early
pioneers, the modern Internet is, in many respects, dystopic
to extremes that would make even Orwell blush.
The causes are systemic: the core Internet protocols were,
quite simply, not designed with privacy in mind. This ap-
athetic approach to privacy permeates through to the ap-
plication layer, culminating in today‚Äôs burgeoning Internet
marketplace in which consumers are the product. If we are to
have any hope of reneging on this Faustian bargain, it will be
through the development and deployment of protocols that
respect the privacy and autonomy of all users.
One tool that can help in this regard is sender-anony-
including recent works
mous messaging (SAM) protocols,
Riposte [11] and Express [14]. Such protocols can form the
backend for, among other things, whistleblower drop boxes,
anonymous email systems, or Twitter-like broadcast media
with strong and provable privacy guarantees. This paper
proposes a novel SAM protocol that subsumes and fortifies
both Riposte and Express, promising equivalent privacy and
functionality for clients alongside lower overhead and supe-
rior resistance to denial-of-service attacks.
A. Sender-anonymous messaging
Prior work in this space has considered one of two pri-
mary settings for SAM protocols: (i) the sender-anonymous
bulletin-board model and (ii) the sender-anonymous mailbox
model. Protocols that operate in this first model‚Äîexemplified
by Riposte [11]‚Äîsupport Twitter-like broadcast messaging
while severing the link between authors and their tweets.
Protocols that operate in the second model‚Äîexemplified by
Express [14]‚Äîsupport Secure Drop-like mailboxes into which
whistleblowers can leak documents and tips anonymously to
journalists, law enforcement, and watchdogs.
Sender-anonymous bulletin boards:
In the bulletin-board
model, two or more semi-honest and non-colluding servers
jointly host a shared, sparse database (the ‚Äúbulletin board‚Äù)
comprising a large number of write locations called buckets.
Senders can write messages into arbitrary buckets without
disclosing to the servers (or the subsequent readers) which
particular messages they penned and which were penned by
others. For this to work, senders must always write their
messages to uniform random buckets‚Äîpotentially clobber-
ing messages previously written to those buckets by other
senders. Therefore, the number of buckets must be large
enough that the probability of accidental collisions is low,
implying that the bulletin board requires ‚Ñ¶(ùëö2) buckets to
accommodate ùëö written messages sans any expected colli-
sions. Readers obtain messages of interest from the bulletin
board either ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù (an undeniably leaky proposition)
or via some oblivious means such as private information
retrieval (PIR) [9].
Sender-anonymous mailboxes:
In the mailbox model, two
or more semi-honest and non-colluding servers jointly host
a collection of registered ‚Äúmailboxes‚Äù. Senders can deposit
documents into specific mailboxes if and only if they know
the corresponding mailbox addresses‚Äîcryptographically long,
unpredictable bit strings‚Äîwithout disclosing to the servers
or mailbox owners which particular documents they de-
posit into which particular mailboxes. The use of registered
mailboxes obviates the need both for PIR and for collision-
avoidance and -recovery strategies of the sort required in the
bulletin-board model, potentially enabling constructions that
are significantly more performant and scalable. However, it
comes at the cost of limiting the use cases to single-recipient
applications like email and secure drop boxes.
Relationship with onion routing and mix networks: SAM
protocols solve a problem that is related to, yet distinct
from those solved by onion routers and mix networks. Onion
routing systems like Tor [12] support session-based, bidirec-
tional anonymous links to facilitate low-latency interactive
communications such as instant messaging or web browsing;
mix networks like MCMix [2] likewise support bidirectional
anonymity, but target communications that can tolerate rela-
tively high latency such as email. In both cases, the emphasis
is on mitigating the threat of traffic analysis. By contrast,
SAM protocols seek only to hide the association between
senders and the messages they send‚Äîa much less ambitious
goal. The upshot of this narrow focus is that it enables SAM
protocols to provide very concrete anonymity guarantees (in
contrast to the comparatively ‚Äúfragile‚Äù guarantees of onion
routing) while imposing only modest latency (in contrast to
the high latency imposed by mix networks).

B. Denial-of-service attacks
SAM constructions in both the bulletin-board and mail-
box models may be susceptible to denial of service (DoS)
attacks, wherein a hostile entity seeks to prevent others from
distributing messages via the service. Such an attacker can
employ at least two distinct tactics: (i) submit malformed
write requests in a bid to corrupt the message database, or
(ii) unleash an army of Sybils masquerading as legitimate
senders in a bid to overwhelm the servers‚Äô resources.
Effective defences against the first style of DoS attacker
represents the primary technical innovation of prior work on
SAM protocols; the latter style of DoS attacker, by contrast,
has received scant mention in the literature. At first blush,
this might seem a reasonable state of affairs, as virtually
all Internet-connected systems are (unavoidably) susceptible
to some flavour of resource exhaustion-style DoS attacks.
Nevertheless, we contend that the threat of such attacks is
especially acute in SAM protocols, where they can serve
as indirect means for silencing or deanonymizing would-
be bulletin board posters and whistleblowers attempting to
leak documents to a secure drop box. The sender-anony-
mous mailbox model‚Äîwhere writers must target registered
mailboxes using cryptographically long and unpredictable
mailbox addresses‚Äîbrings about the potential to efficiently
detect and drop write requests by DoS attackers while still
processing honest writes.1 Yet, looking ahead, we observe
that Express, the state-of-the-art SAM protocol in the mailbox
model, actually grants would-be resource exhaustion-style
DoS attackers an exponential amplification factor: with just
Œò(lg ùëõ) ultralightweight operations, a DoS attacker can force
the servers to perform ‚Ñ¶(ùëõ) comparatively expensive oper-
ations. (By comparison, Sabre requires each server to do a
small constant factor less work than the DoS attacker.)
C. Overview of the state of the art
We now provide a brief overview of the state-of-the-art
SAM constructions in the bulletin board and mailbox mod-
els. Both constructions leverage so-called distributed point
functions (DPFs) to implement oblivious writes, employing
probabilistic audit protocols based on secure multiparty com-
putation or zero-knowledge proofs to weed out malformed
DPFs that would otherwise corrupt the database. We give an
in-depth treatment of DPFs in Section II-A; for now, it suffices
to regard a DPF as a compact, functional representation
of a secret-shared 1-hot vector in which the sole non-zero
component‚Äôs value is the message to write and its position
the bucket or mailbox at which to write it.
1) Riposte: The state-of-the-art system in the sender-
anonymous bulletin-board model is the Riposte scheme of
Corrigan-Gibbs, Boneh, and Mazi√®res [11]. Riposte uses a
simple O(‚àö
ùëõ)-sized DPF to implement oblivious writes into
a bulletin board consisting of ùëõ buckets. To obtain good
concrete communication and computation costs, the authors
1Here we implicitly assume that mailbox registration is somewhat Sybil
resistant; e.g., prospective mailbox registrants may need to prove their
identities or pay service fees to the SAM servers.
propose using a bulletin board with just ùëõ = 19.5ùëö buckets
(in contrast to the ‚Ñ¶(ùëö2) buckets dictated by the birthday
bound) so that any given message (out of ùëö) will collide with
another message for around 5% of the writes.2
Riposte‚Äôs audit protocol comes in two variants:
(i) a
lightweight, 3-server variant based on probabilistic batch
testing and secure (2+1)-party computation, and (ii) a com-
paratively heavyweight ‚Ñì-server variant based on so-called
seed-homomorphic pseudorandom generators and zero-knowl-
edge proofs of knowledge. We describe here only the lighter-
weight 3-server variant.
Consider a 3-server Riposte instance with security param-
eter ùúÜ ‚àà N (say, ùúÜ = 128) whose bulletin board comprises
ùëõ = 19.5ùëö buckets each capable of holding a single ùêø-bit
message and, for ease of exposition, suppose that ùëõ = ‚Ñéùë§
2ùêø)1√óùë§ be a crypto-
with ùúÜ‚Ñé ‚âà ùêøùë§. Further, let ùê∫ : F
graphically secure pseudorandom generator (PRG). To post a
message ùëÄ ‚àà F
1) samples a random bucket index ùëñ ‚ààR {0, . . . , ùëõ ‚àí 1} and
then rewrites it as ùëñ = ùëû ùë§ + ùëü with 0 ‚â§ ùëû < ‚Ñé and
0 ‚â§ ùëü < ùë§;
