sending hosts that their IPv4 packets are being 
dropped due to congestion at the router. The sending 
hosts then send packets less frequently. 
Destination Unreachable 
Routers and destination hosts send Destination 
Unreachable messages to inform sending hosts that 
their packets cannot be delivered. 
Table 2-3  Common ICMP Messages 
ICMP contains a series of defined Destination Unreachable messages. Table 2-3 lists and describes 
the most common messages. 
Destination Unreachable Message 
Description 
Host Unreachable 
Routers send Host Unreachable messages when they 
cannot find routes to destination IPv4 addresses. 
Protocol Unreachable 
Destination IPv4 nodes send Protocol Unreachable 
messages when they cannot match the Protocol field 
in the IPv4 header with an IPv4 client protocol that is 
currently in use. 
Port Unreachable 
IPv4 nodes send Port Unreachable messages when 
they cannot match the Destination Port field in the 
UDP header with an application using that UDP port. 
Fragmentation Needed and DF Set 
IPv4 routers send Fragmentation Needed and DF Set 
messages when fragmentation must occur but the 
sending node has set the Don’t Fragment (DF) flag in 
the IPv4 header. 
Table 2-3  Common ICMP Destination Unreachable Messages 
ICMP does not make IPv4 a reliable protocol. ICMP attempts to report errors and provide feedback on 
specific conditions. ICMP messages are carried as unacknowledged IPv4 packets and are themselves 
unreliable.  
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) 
Routers and hosts use IGMP to manage membership in IPv4 multicast groups on a subnet. An IPv4 
multicast group, also known as a host group, is a set of hosts that listen for IPv4 traffic destined for a 
specific IPv4 multicast address. IPv4 multicast traffic on a given subnet is sent to a single MAC address 
but received and processed by multiple IPv4 hosts. A host group member listens on a specific IPv4 
multicast address and receives all packets sent to that IPv4 address.  
For a host to receive IPv4 multicasts, an application must inform IPv4 that it will receive multicasts at a 
specified IPv4 multicast address. IPv4 then informs the routers on locally attached subnets that it

TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 33 
should receive multicasts sent to the specified IPv4 multicast address. IGMP is the protocol to register 
host group membership information. 
IGMP messages take the following forms: 
Host group members use the IGMP Host Membership Report message to declare their membership in 
a specific host group. 
Routers use the IGMP Host Membership Query message to poll subnets for information about 
members of host groups. 
Host group members use the IGMP Leave Group message when they leave a group of which they 
might be the last member on the subnet. 
For IPv4 multicasting to span routers across an IPv4 network, routers use multicast routing protocols to 
communicate host group information. Each router that supports multicast forwarding can then 
determine how to forward IPv4 multicast traffic. 
For more information about IP multicasting for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks, see Appendix A, "IP 
Multicast." 
Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP support IGMP, IGMP 
version 2, and IGMP version 3, which RFC 1112, RFC 2236, and RFC 3376 define respectively.

IPv6 Internet Layer 
IPv6 will eventually replace the IPv4 Internet layer protocols in the DARPA model. IPv6 replaces: 
IPv4 with IPv6  IPv6 is a routable protocol that addresses, routes, fragments, and reassembles 
packets. 
ICMP with ICMPv6  ICMPv6 provides diagnostic functions and reports errors when IPv6 packets 
cannot be delivered. 
IGMP with MLD  MLD manages IPv6 multicast group membership. 
ARP with ND  ND manages interaction between neighboring nodes, including automatically configuring 
addresses and resolving next-hop IPv6 addresses to MAC addresses. 
Software developers do not need to change the protocols at the Transport and Application layers to 
support operation over an IPv6 Internet layer, except when addresses are part of the payload or part of 
the data structures maintained by the protocol. For example, software developers must update both 
TCP and UDP to perform a new checksum, and they must update RIP to send and receive IPv6-based 
routing information.  
The IPv6 Internet layer consists of the following protocols: 
IPv6 
ICMPv6 
ND 
MLD 
The following sections describe these protocols in more detail. 
IPv6 
Like IPv4, IPv6 is a connectionless, unreliable datagram protocol that is primarily responsible for 
addressing and routing packets between hosts.  
RFC 2460 defines IPv6 packet structure. An IPv6 packet consists of an IPv6 header and an IPv6 
payload. The IPv6 payload consists of zero or more IPv6 extension headers and an upper layer 
protocol data unit, such as an ICMPv6 message, a TCP segment, or a UDP message. Figure 2-4 
shows the basic structure of an IPv6 packet. 
Figure 2-4  Basic structure of an IPv6 packet 
Table 2-4 lists and describes the key fields in the IPv6 header. 
Chapter 2 – Architectural Overview of the TCP/IP Protocol Suite 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

IPv6 Header Field 
Description 
Source Address 
A 128-bit IPv6 address to identify the original source of 
the IPv6 packet. 
Destination Address 
A 128-bit IPv6 address to identify the intermediate or 
final destination of the IPv6 packet. 
Next Header 
An identifier for either the IPv6 extension header 
immediately following the IPv6 header or an upper 
layer protocol, such as ICMPv6, TCP, or UDP. 
Hop Limit 
The number of links on which the packet is allowed to 
travel before being discarded by a router.  The 
sending host sets the hop limit, and routers decrease 
the hop limit by one when forwarding an IPv6 packet. 
This field prevents packets from endlessly circulating 
on an IPv6 network. 
Table 2-4  Key Fields in the IPv6 Header 
IPv6 Extension Headers 
IPv6 payloads can contain zero or more extension headers, which can vary in length. A Next Header 
field in the IPv6 header indicates the next extension header. Each extension header contains another 
Next Header field that indicates the next extension header. The last extension header indicates the 
upper layer protocol (such as TCP, UDP, or ICMPv6), if any, that the upper layer protocol data unit 
contains. 
The IPv6 header and extension headers replace the existing IPv4 header and its capability to include 
options. The new format for extension headers allows IPv6 to be augmented to support future needs 
and capabilities. Unlike options in the IPv4 header, IPv6 extension headers have no maximum size and 
can expand to accommodate all the extension data needed for IPv6 communication. 
RFC 2460 defines the following IPv6 extension headers that all IPv6 nodes must support: 
Hop-by-Hop Options header 
Destination Options header 
Routing header 
Fragment header 
Authentication header 
Encapsulating Security Payload header 
Typical IPv6 packets contain no extension headers. Sending hosts add one or more extension headers 
only if intermediate routers or the destination need to handle a packet in a particular way. 
Fragmentation in IPv6 
In IPv4, if a router receives a packet that is too large for the network segment to which the packet is 
being forwarded and fragmentation of the packet is allowed, IPv4 on the router fragments the original 
packet into smaller packets that fit on the forwarding network segment. In IPv6, only the sending host 
Chapter 2 – Architectural Overview of the TCP/IP Protocol Suite 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 36 
fragments a packet. If an IPv6 packet is too large, the IPv6 router sends an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big 
message to the sending host and discards the packet. 
A sending host can fragment packets and destination hosts can reassemble packets through the use of 
the Fragment extension header. 
Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) 
Like IPv4, IPv6 does not report errors. Instead, IPv6 uses an updated version of ICMP for IPv4. This 
new version is named ICMPv6, and it performs the common ICMP for IPv4 functions of reporting errors 
in delivery or forwarding and providing a simple echo service for troubleshooting. The ICMPv6 protocol 
also provides a message structure for ND and MLD messages. 
Table 2-5 lists and describes the ICMPv6 messages defined in RFC 4443. 
ICMPv6 Message 
Description 
Echo Request 
Sending hosts send Echo Request messages to check 
IPv6 connectivity to a particular node. 
Echo Reply 
Nodes send Echo Reply messages to reply to ICMPv6 
Echo Request messages. 
Destination Unreachable 
Routers or destination hosts send Destination 
Unreachable messages to inform sending hosts that 
packets or payloads cannot be delivered. 
Packet Too Big 
Routers send Packet Too Big messages to inform 
sending hosts that packets are too large to forward. 
Time Exceeded 
Routers send Time Exceeded messages to inform 
sending hosts that the hop limit of an IPv6 packet has 
expired. 
Parameter Problem 
Routers send Parameter Problem messages to inform 
sending hosts when errors were encountered in 
processing the IPv6 header or an IPv6 extension 
header. 
Table 2-5  Common ICMPv6 Messages 
ICMPv6 contains a series of defined Destination Unreachable messages. Table 2-6 lists and describes 
the most common messages. 
Chapter 2 – Architectural Overview of the TCP/IP Protocol Suite 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 37 
Destination Unreachable Message 
Description 
No Route Found 
Routers send this message when they cannot find 
routes to the destination IPv6 addresses in their local 
IPv6 routing tables. 
Communication Prohibited by Administrative Policy 
Routers send this message when a policy configured 
on the router prohibits communication with the 
destination. For example, this type of message is sent 
when a firewall discards a packet. 
Destination Address Unreachable 
IPv6 routers send this message when they cannot 
resolve a destination’s MAC address. 
Destination Port Unreachable 
Destination hosts send this message when an IPv6 
packet containing a UDP message to a destination 
UDP port does not correspond to a listening 
application. 
Table 2-6  Common ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable Messages 
ICMPv6 does not make IPv6 a reliable protocol. ICMPv6 attempts to report errors and provide feedback 
on specific conditions. ICMPv6 messages are carried as unacknowledged IPv6 packets and are 
themselves unreliable. 
Neighbor Discovery (ND) 
ND is a set of ICMPv6 messages and processes that determine relationships between neighboring 
nodes. ND replaces ARP, ICMP Router Discovery, and ICMP Redirect used in IPv4 and provides 
additional functionality. 
Hosts use ND to: 
Discover neighboring routers. 
Discover and automatically configure addresses and other configuration parameters.  
Routers use ND to: 
Advertise their presence, host addresses, and other configuration parameters. 
Inform hosts of a better next-hop address to forward packets for a specific destination. 
Nodes (both hosts and routers) use ND to: 
Resolve the link-layer address (also known as a MAC address) of a neighboring node to which an IPv6 
packet is being forwarded 
Dynamically advertise changes in MAC addresses. 
Determine whether a neighbor is still reachable. 
Table 2-7 lists and describes the ND processes described in RFC 4861.

Neighbor Discovery Process 
Description 
Router discovery 
The process by which a host discovers its neighboring 
routers. For more information, see "Router Discovery" 
later in this chapter. 
Prefix discovery 
The process by which hosts discover the subnet 
prefixes for local subnet destinations. For more 
information about IPv6 subnet prefixes, see Chapter 3, 
"IP Addressing." 
Address autoconfiguration 
The process for configuring IPv6 addresses for 
interfaces in either the presence or absence of an 
address configuration server such as one running 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 
(DHCPv6). For more information, see "Address 
Autoconfiguration" later in this chapter. 
Address resolution 
The process by which nodes resolve a neighbor’s IPv6 
address to its MAC address. Address resolution in 
IPv6 is equivalent to ARP in IPv4. For more 
information, see "Address Resolution" in this chapter. 
Next-hop determination 
The process by which a node determines the next-hop 
IPv6 address to which a packet is being forwarded 
based on the destination address. The next-hop 
address is either the destination address or the 
address of a neighboring router. 
Neighbor unreachability detection 
The process by which a node determines that the IPv6 
layer of a neighbor is not capable of sending or 
receiving packets. 
Duplicate address detection 
The process by which a node determines that an 
address considered for use is not already in use by a 
neighboring node. 
Redirect function 
The process of informing a host of a better first-hop 
IPv6 address to reach a destination. 
Table 2-7  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Processes 
Address Resolution 
IPv6 address resolution consists of exchanging Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement 
messages to resolve the next-hop IPv6 address to its corresponding MAC address. The sending host 
sends a multicast Neighbor Solicitation message on the appropriate interface. The Neighbor Solicitation
