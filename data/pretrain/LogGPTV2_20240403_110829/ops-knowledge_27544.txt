User: I've been using Python's built-in cProfile tool with some pretty good success.  But I'd like to be able to access more information such as how long I'm waiting for I/O (and what kind of I/O I'm waiting on) or how many cache misses I have.  Are there any Linux tools to help with this beyond your basic time command?
Assistant: I'm not sure if python will provide the low level information you are looking for.  You might want to look at oprofile and latencytop though.
