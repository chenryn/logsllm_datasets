correlate isolated alert sets. Third, from the security ana-
lyst’s point of view, it is necessary to combine the local or
low-level correlation results, investigate and assess the at-
tack situation in order to make timely and appropriate re-
sponse or prevention.
Given two individual isolated scenarios being studied,
denoted as S1 and S2, where S1 = {e1, e2, ..., ei, ..., em},
S2 = {e

where P = {P1, P2, ..., Pk, ..., Pf}, and Pk is denoted as a
speciﬁc attack plan that is represented by a causal network
converted from attack trees, the problem is to ﬁnd the rela-
tionship between S1 and S2. Algorithm 1 shows the method
of correlating two isolated scenarios.

Intuitively, given a set of correlated alerts as observed
evidence, we input the evidence into the causal network so
that we can make inference and compute the likelihood for

The computation result is used to infer the likelihood that
a node can be the future goal(s) or future attack step, i.e.,
P (Zi = 1|evidence). As shown in Algorithm 3, In the ﬁ-
nal selection of possible future goal or attack steps, we can
either select the node(s) that has the maximum belief value
or the one(s) whose belief value is above a threshold.
5. Experiments
To evaluate the effectiveness of our alert correlation
mechanisms, we applied our algorithms to one of the data
sets of the Grand Challenge Problem (GCP) version 3.1 pro-
vided by DARPA’s Cyber Panel program [12, 18], Scenario
I.
GCP version 3.1 Scenario I contains an innovative worm
attack scenario designed speciﬁcally to evaluate alert corre-
lation techniques. In addition to the complicated attack sce-
narios, the GCP data sets also include many background
alerts that make alert correlation and attack strategy de-
tection more challenging. In the GCP, multiple heteroge-
neous security systems, e.g., network-based IDSs, host-
based IDSs, ﬁrewalls, and network management systems,
are deployed in several network enclaves. Therefore, the
GCP alerts are from both security systems and network
management system. We applied our correlation techniques
described in [24, 25] to aggregate, prioritize and correlate
raw alerts and resulted in correlated alert sets.
In the GCP Scenario I, there are multiple network en-
claves in which attacks are conducted separately. The at-
tack scenario in each network enclave is almost the same.
We select a network enclave as an example to show the pro-
cess of scenario correlation and attack prediction.
Figure 3(a) shows an example of two isolated attack
scenarios derived from low-level alert correlation, where
DB FTP Globbing Attack represents an buffer over ﬂow at-
tack against the database server, DB NewClient Target in-
dicates an suspicious incoming connection to the database
server from another server, DB Illegal File Access repre-
sents the illegal access (write or read) to the database
indicates a suspicious outbound
server, DB NewClient
connection from database to an external host, and
Loki means a suspicious data export via covert chan-
nel. In this case, we use the attack plan as deﬁned
in Figure
1(a). The corresponding causal network is
shown in Figure 1(b). According to Figure 1(b), we
