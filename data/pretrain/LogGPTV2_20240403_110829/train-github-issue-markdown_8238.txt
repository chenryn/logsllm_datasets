# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
It isn't related to a problem. But if what I'm asking already exists its a
good idea to let it more clear on the docs.
## Describe the solution you'd like
It will be awesome if we can add a config on `next.config` that allow us to
add a ignored name folder to `/pages` that will not crawl that folder as an
app page.  
The purpose of it is a way to create a components folder wich has the
components that belong to a unique page and (probably) wont be reused again.
That kind of practice let clear that this components belong only to that page
and will be easier to add things like useMemo, React.memo and useCallback
without pollute the root `/components` folder with never reused components.
Something like:
Folder:
    /pages
    ....  /customers
    ........  /components
    ........  index.js
Config:
    module.exports = {
        notPage: ['components']
    };
## Describe alternatives you've considered
It is possible to create a `/pages` components inside `root` `/components`
folder and there add that kind of component.
