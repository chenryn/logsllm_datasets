Abstract
Modern spam is ultimately driven by product sales:
goods purchased by customers online. However, while
this model is easy to state in the abstract, our under-
standing of the concrete business environment—how
many orders, of what kind, from which customers, for
how much—is poor at best. This situation is unsurpris-
ing since such sellers typically operate under question-
able legal footing, with “ground truth” data rarely avail-
able to the public. However, absent quantiﬁable empiri-
cal data, “guesstimates” operate unchecked and can dis-
tort both policy making and our choice of appropri-
ate interventions. In this paper, we describe two infer-
ence techniques for peering inside the business opera-
tions of spam-advertised enterprises: purchase pair and
basket inference. Using these, we provide informed esti-
mates on order volumes, product sales distribution, cus-
tomer makeup and total revenues for a range of spam-
advertised programs.
Introduction
1
A large number of Internet scams are “advertising-
based”; that is, their goal is to convince potential cus-
tomers to purchase a product or service, typically via
some broad-based advertising medium.1 In turn, this ac-
tivity mobilizes and helps fund a broad array of technical
capabilities, including botnet-based distribution, fast ﬂux
name service, and bulletproof hosting. However, while
these same technical aspects enjoy a great deal of atten-
tion from the security community, there is considerably
less information quantifying the underlying economic
engine that drives this ecosystem. Absent grounded em-
pirical data, it is challenging to reconcile revenue “esti-
mates” that can range from $2M/day for one spam bot-
net [1], to analyses suggesting that spammers make little

rum spam, and comment spam. Hereafter we refer to these myriad ad-
vertising vectors simply as spam.
money at all [6]. This situation has the potential to distort
policy and investment decisions that are otherwise driven
by intuition rather than evidence.
In this paper we make two contributions to improving
this state of affairs using measurement-based methods to
estimate:
• Order volume. We describe a general technique—
purchase pair—for estimating the number of orders
received (and hence revenue) via on-line store order
numbering. We use this approach to establish rough,
but well-founded, monthly order volume estimates
for many of the leading “afﬁliate programs” selling
counterfeit pharmaceuticals and software.
• Purchasing behavior. We show how we can use
third-party image hosting data to infer the contents
of customer “baskets” and hence characterize pur-
chasing behavior. We apply this technique to a lead-
ing spamvertized pharmaceutical program and iden-
tify both the nature of these purchases and their re-
lation to the geographic distribution of the customer
base.
In each case, our real contribution is less in the par-
ticular techniques—which an adversary could easily de-
feat should they seek to do so—but rather in the data that
we used them to gather. In particular, we document that
seven leading counterfeit pharmacies together have a to-
tal monthly order volume in excess of 82,000, while three
counterfeit software stores process over 37,000 orders in
the same time.
On the demand side, as expected, we ﬁnd that most
pharmaceuticals selected for purchase are in the “male-
enhancement” category (primarily Viagra and other ED
medications comprising 60 distinct items). However,
such drugs constitute only 62% of the total, and we doc-
ument that this demand distribution has quite a long tail;
user shopping carts contain 289 distinct products, includ-
ing surprising categories such as anti-cancer medications
(Arimidex and Gleevec), anti-schizophrenia drugs (Sero-
quel), and asthma medications (Advair and Ventolin).
We also discover signiﬁcant differences in the purchas-
ing habits of U.S. and non-U.S. customers.
Combining these measurements, we synthesize overall
revenue estimates for each program, which can be well
in excess of $1M per month for a single enterprise. To
the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst empirical data
set of its kind, as well as the ﬁrst to provide insight into
the market size of the spam-advertised goods market and
corresponding customer purchasing behavior.
We structure the remainder of this paper as follows.
In § 2 we motivate the need for such research, explain
the limitations of existing data, and provide background
about how the spam-advertised business model works to-
day. We discuss our purchase pair technique in § 3, val-
idating our technique for internal consistency and then
presenting order volume estimates across seven of the
top pharmaceutical afﬁliate programs and three counter-
feit software programs. We then explore the customer dy-
namics for one particular pharmaceutical program, Eva-
Pharmacy, in § 4. We explain how to use image log data
to identify customer purchases and then document how,
where and when the EvaPharmacy customer base places
its orders. We summarize our ﬁndings in § 5, devising
estimates of revenue and comparing them with external
validation. We conclude with a discussion about the im-
plications of our ﬁndings in § 6.
2 Background
The security community is at once awash in the tech-
nical detail of new threats—the precise nature of a new
vulnerability or the systematic analysis of a new botnet’s
command and control protocol—yet somewhat deﬁcient
in analyzing the economic processes that underlie these
activities. In fairness, it is difﬁcult to produce such anal-
yses; there are innate operational complexities in acquir-
ing such economic data and inherent uncertainties when
reasoning about underground activities whose true scope
is rarely visible directly.
However, absent a rigorous treatment, the resulting in-
formation vacuum is all too easily ﬁlled with opinion,
which in turn can morph into “fact” over time. Though
pervasive, this problem seemingly reached its zenith in
the 2005 claim by US Treasury Department consultant
Valerie McNiven that cybercrime revenue exceeded that
of the drug trade (over $100 billion at the time) [11].
This claim was frequently repeated by members of the
security industry, growing in size each year, ultimately
reaching its peak in 2009 with written Congressional tes-
timony by AT&T’s chief security ofﬁcer stating that cy-
bercrime reaped “more than $1 trillion annually in illicit
proﬁts” [23]—a ﬁgure well in excess of the entire soft-
ware industry and almost twice the GDP of Germany.
Nay-sayers are similarly limited in their empirical evi-
dence. Perhaps best known in this group are Herley and
Florencio, who argue that a variety of cybercrimes are
generally unproﬁtable. However, lacking empirical data,
they are forced to use an economic meta-analysis to make
their case [5, 6, 7].
Unfortunately, the answer to such questions matters.
Without an “evidence basis”, policy and investment de-
cisions are easily distorted along inﬂuence lines, either
over-reacting to small problems or under-appreciating
the scope of grave ones.
2.1 Estimating spam revenue and demand
In this paper we examine only a small subset of such
activity: spam-advertised counterfeit pharmacies and, to
a lesser extent, counterfeit software stores. However,
even here public estimates can vary widely. In 2005,
one consultancy estimated that Russian spammers earned
roughly US$2–3M per year [18]. However, in a 2008
interview, one IBM representative claimed that a single
spamming botnet was earning close to $2M per day [1].
Our previous work studied the same botnet empirically,
leading to an estimate of daily revenue of up to $9,500,
extrapolating to $3.5M per year [10]. Most recently, a re-
port by the Russian Association of Electronic Communi-
cation (RAEC) estimated that Russian spammers earned
3.7 billion rubles (roughly $125 million) in 2009 [12].
The demand side of this equation is even less well
understood, relying almost entirely on opt-in phone or
email polls. In 2004, the Business Software Alliance
sponsored a Forrester Research poll to examine this
question, ﬁnding that out of 6,000 respondents (spread
evenly across the US, Canada, Germany, France, the UK
and Brazil) 27% had purchased spam-advertised soft-
ware and 13% had purchased spam-advertised pharma-
ceuticals [3]. If such data were taken at face value, the US
market size for spam-advertised pharmaceuticals would
exceed 30 million customers. Similar studies, one by
Marshal in 2008 and the other sponsored by the Mes-
saging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) in 2009,
estimate that 29% and 12%, respectively, of Internet
users had purchased goods or services advertised in spam
email [8, 19].
In our previous work on empirically quantifying rev-
enue for such activities, our measurements were only
able to capture a few percent of orders for sites adver-
tised by a single botnet serving a single afﬁliate program,
GlavMed [10]. Here, we aim to signiﬁcantly extend our
understanding, with our results covering total order vol-
ume for ﬁve of the six top pharmacy afﬁliate programs,
and three of the top ﬁve counterfeit software afﬁliate pro-
grams. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge our anal-
ysis of EvaPharmacy is the ﬁrst measurement-based ex-
amination of customer purchasing behavior, the demand
component of the counterfeit pharmacy ecosystem.
2.2 How spam-advertised sites work
To provide context for the analysis in this paper, we ﬁrst
describe how modern spam is monetized and the ecosys-
tem that supports it.
Today, spam of all kinds represents an outsourced mar-
keting operation in service to an underlying sales activ-
ity. At the core are “afﬁliate programs” that provide retail
content (e.g., storefront templates and site code) as well
as back-end services (e.g., payment processing, fulﬁll-
ment and customer support) to a set of client afﬁliates.
Afﬁliates in turn are paid on a commission basis (typ-
ically 30–50% in the pharmaceutical market) for each
sale they bring in via whatever advertising vector they
are able to harness effectively. This dynamic is well de-
scribed in Samosseiko’s “Partnerka” paper [22] and also
in our recent work studying the spam value chain [16].
Thus, while an afﬁliate has a responsibility to attract
customers and host their shopping experience (which in-
cludes maintaining the contents of their “shopping cart”),
once a customer decides to “check out” the afﬁliate hands
the process over to the operators of the afﬁliate program.2
Consequently, we would expect to ﬁnd the order process-
ing service shared across all afﬁliates of a particular pro-
gram, regardless of the means used to attract customers.
Indeed, as discussed below, our measurements of pur-
chases from different members of the same afﬁliate con-
ﬁrm that the order numbers associated with the purchases
come from a common pool. This ﬁnding is critical for our
study because it means that side-effects in the order pro-
cessing phase reﬂect the actions of all sales activity for
an entire program, rather than just the sales of a single
member.
On the back end, order processing consists of sev-
eral steps: authorization, settlement, fulﬁllment, and cus-
tomer service. Authorization is the process by which
the merchant conﬁrms, through the appropriate payment
card association (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, American Ex-
press, Japan Credit Bureau, etc.), that the customer has
sufﬁcient funds. For the most common payment cards
(Visa/MC), this process consists of contacting the cus-
tomer’s issuing bank, ensuring that the card is valid and
the customer possesses sufﬁcient funds, and placing a
lien on the current credit balance. Once the good or ser-
vice is ready for delivery, the merchant can then execute
a settlement transaction that actualizes this lien, transfer-
ring money to the merchant’s bank. Finally, fulﬁllment
comprises packaging and delivery (e.g., shipping drugs
2This transfer typically takes the form of a redirection to a pay-
ment gateway site (with the afﬁliate’s identity encoded in the request),
although some sites also support a proxy mode so the customer can
appear to remain at the same Web site.
directly from a foreign supplier or providing a Web site
and password for downloading software). For our study,
however, the key leverage lies in customer service. To
support customer service, payment sites generate indi-
vidual order numbers to share with the customer. In the
next section, we describe how we can use the details of
this process to infer the overall transaction rate, and ulti-
mately revenue, of an entire afﬁliate program.
3 Order volume
Underlying our purchase pair measurement approach is
a model of how afﬁliate programs handle transactions,
and, in particular, how they assign order numbers.
3.1 Basic idea
Upon placing an order, most afﬁliate programs provide a
conﬁrmation page that includes an “order number” (typ-
ically numeric, or at least having a clear numeric compo-
nent) that uniquely speciﬁes the customer’s transaction.
For purchases where an order number does not appear
on the conﬁrmation page, the seller can provide one in
a conﬁrmation email (the common case), or make one
available via login to the seller’s Web site. The order
number allows the customer to specify the particular pur-
chase in any subsequent emails, when using customer
support Web sites, or when contacting online support
via email, IM or live Web chat. For the purchases we
made, we found that the seller generally provides the or-
der number before the authorization step (indeed, even
before merchant-side fraud checks such as Address Ver-
iﬁcation Service), although purely local checks such as
Luhn digit validation are frequently performed ﬁrst. Ac-
cordingly, we can consider the creation of an order num-
ber only as evidence that a customer attempted an order,
not that it successfully concluded. Thus, the estimates we
form in this work reﬂect an upper bound on the transac-
tion rate, including transactions declined during autho-
rization or settlement.3
The most important property for such order numbers
is their uniqueness; that each customer order is assigned
a singular number that is distinguished over time with-
out the possibility of aliasing. While there are a vast
number of ways such uniqueness could be implemented
(e.g., a pseudo-random permutation function), the easi-
est approach by far is to simply increment a global vari-
able for each new order. Indeed, the serendipitous ob-
servation that motivated our study was that multiple pur-
chases made from the same afﬁliate program produced
3In 2008, Visa documented that card-not-present transactions such
as e-commerce had an issuer decline rate of 14% system-wide [25]. In
addition, it seems likely that some orders are declined at the merchant’s
processor due to purely local fraud checks (such as per-card or per-
address velocity checks or disparities between IP address geolocation
versus shipping address).
order numbers that appeared to monotonically increase
over time. Observing the monotonic nature of this se-
quence, we hypothesized that order number allocation is
implemented by serializing access to a single global vari-
able that is incremented each time an order is made; we
call this the sequential update hypothesis. To assess this
hypothesis, we examined source code for over a dozen
