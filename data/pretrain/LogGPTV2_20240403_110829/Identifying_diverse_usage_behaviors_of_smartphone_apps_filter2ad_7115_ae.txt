top 1000 popular apps. It shows that 10% apps access the network
from more than two sectors. Thus, our results indicate that a signiﬁ-
cant fraction of the apps are used when users move around, creating
another issue for content caching and delivery techniques. Base
stations in future cellular network designs (e.g., LTE) have been
considered potential locations for content caching and optimization
(since they would be the ﬁrst IP hop), so signiﬁcant amount user
movement could make it more difﬁcult to cache content appropri-
ately. Table 5 shows that the majority of these apps are games or
social networking apps, but there are also a few music and news
apps.
4.4 User Patterns: Impact of User Interests
on Smartphone Apps Usage
The needs and interests of individual users are the primary fac-
tors that inform their usage of apps. Because of user interests, the
usage of different apps tends to be correlated. In this section, we an-

alyze the extent to which user apps are correlated. Our analysis has
many motivations: knowing what sets of apps are correlated would
be helpful for both app developers as well as OS vendors, as they
can factor this correlation into their designs and help the apps work
better with each other. From a network perspective, such knowl-
edge could help optimize performance or user experience for a set
of apps as a bundle, and may also enhance troubleshooting. In addi-
tion, app markets can leverage this information for recommending
new apps to users.
50 most popular apps have over 2000 unique subscribers). Then at
this value of the Jaccard Similarity Coefﬁcient, a and b share 100
unique subscribers. Given that there are more than 600,000 unique
subscribers in our data set, the overlap of 100 subscribers is un-
likely to be due to random chance, indicating that users of app a
have a tendency to also use app b. We also note that as we increase
the number of popular apps from 50-1000, there is a smaller frac-
tion of app pairs that have a signiﬁcant overlap in subscribers. This
is expected, since an app is more likely to have subscribers overlap
with other apps when gets used by more and more subscribers.

Figure 12: distribution of the Jaccard Similarity Coefﬁcient of
the popular apps.
We use the Jaccard Similarity Coefﬁcient to quantify the over-
lap between a pair of apps a and b: we count the number of unique
subscribers who have used both a and b, i.e., joint(a, b), and the
number of unique subscribers who have used either a or b, i.e.,
union(a, b). We can obtain joint(a,b)
union(a,b) for all pairs of apps in the
popular 1000 apps.
Figure 12 shows the distribution of the Jaccard Similarity Coefﬁ-
cient between the top 1000, 500, 100, and 50 apps. We observe that
there is a small fraction of app pairs that have a very high Jaccard
Similarity Coefﬁcient. For example, consider a pair of apps a, b
whose joint(a,b)
= 0.05, and assume that a and b have 2000 unique
union(a,b)
subscribers together (we know from Figure 5(a) that each of the top

.
Next, we analyze how likely it is for a pair of apps to have a
substantial overlap in their users. Our analysis compares the em-
pirical probabilities of a subscriber using each app individually to
the empirical probability of a subscriber using both apps together.
More precisely, let a, b denote apps, and Pr[a], Pr[b] denote the em-
pirical probabilities of a subscriber using app a, b respectively. Let
Pr[ab] denote the empirical probability of a subscriber using both
apps a and b. If the subscribers for each app are selected at random
from the total population, then we would expect that Pr[ab] to be
somewhat close to the product Pr[a]Pr[b]. Figure 13 shows the dis-
tribution of the ratio Pr[ab]
Pr[a][b] (we term this quantity the dependency
337ratio for ease of reference). It shows that nearly 10% of the app
pairs have a dependency ratio that exceeds 10, and 254 pairs have
a ratio exceeding 100.
Table 6 shows the frequency distribution of the genres of these
254 pairs (i.e., pairs with dependency-ratio exceeding 100). We can
make two immediate observations from this table. First, apps in the
same genre are much more likely have correlated usage. For exam-
ple, 110 pairs of two games apps that have high dependency-ratio,
but games apps are part of a only 230 pairs in total. Second, apps in
similar genres are more likely to have high dependence-ratio, e.g.,
entertainment and games, news and entertainment, entertainment
and social networking, travel and navigation, weather and news,
social networking and news, etc.
There are many reasons that pairs of apps have highly correlated
usage. First, many different apps often provide the same type of
content in different forms e.g., there may be multiple local news or
Internet radio stations targeting the same location, and users often
are interested in trying them all out. Or, there may multiple apps
that allow users to access the same social networking sites with
different user interfaces. A second reason may be that a pair of apps
serve similar purpose, but neither may provide complete service
on its own e.g., users may have accounts with multiple banks, and
need to use each bank’s speciﬁc app in order to keep track of all
their accounts. Yet another reason may be that different apps target
similar user interests, and users may try them all out to identify
their favorites, e.g., crossword puzzle apps or sudoku apps.
4.5 Temporal Patterns: Distribution of the Traf-
ﬁc over time of Smartphone Apps
Understanding the diurnal patterns of apps is important for sev-
eral reasons. For example, differences in when certain apps are
used can help inform cloud providers on how to best multiplex re-
sources and operators on what to optimize the network for at dif-
ferent times. In this analysis, we compare the trafﬁc volumes and
access times consumed by smartphone apps at different hours of the
day, both in aggregate as well as for different genres. Our results
show that there are diurnal patterns of app usage both in aggregate,
as well as by genre, but that the patterns of different genres are
noticeably different.
We ﬁrst investigate the diurnal patterns by aggregating all the
popular apps together. For this analysis, we map each ﬂow to the
local time of the device’s geo-location (based on the sector where
the device is connected to the cellular network). Figure 14(a) shows
clear diurnal patterns of trafﬁc volume and network access time.
Around 1AM – 2AM, the total trafﬁc volume and access time are
at their minimum; they start increasing around 4AM, reach the peak
usage around noon, start decreasing after 3PM and drop dramati-
cally after 8PM.
In general, apps have more activity during the daytime than at
night. However, this may not apply to every popular app. Fig-
ure 14(b) shows the distribution of the trafﬁc contribution during
late night for popular apps. According to Figure 14(a), in terms of
both trafﬁc volume or access time, the time period 1:00 AM – 3:59
AM contributes 4.2% trafﬁc. Even if an app generates uniform traf-
ﬁc every hour of the day, it should generate 12.5% trafﬁc from 1:00
AM to 3:59AM. So, Figure 14(b) indicates that there are some apps
that are quite active late at night. We manually investigate these top
66 late night apps according to Figure 14(b) that contribute more
than 12.5% trafﬁc late at night. Table 7 summarizes the results.
It appears that several entertainment and radio apps are used more
frequently than expected at night.
Finally, we analyze diurnal patterns across different genres; we
expect that different genres of apps to have different usage patterns,

since they appeal to different interests. As we did in earlier analy-
sis, we aggregate together the popular apps in the same genre, and
compute the distribution of trafﬁc volumes by genre at hourly in-
tervals (again, using the local time of the ﬂow). Figure 15 shows
the normalized trafﬁc volume across the day; it clearly shows how
different genres do have very different diurnal patterns. In particu-
lar, we see that social network apps have almost exactly the same
pattern as the aggregate, but weather and news apps are most fre-
quently used at early morning. Sports apps, on the other hand, peak
in the early evening, perhaps because users may watch matches or
check scores frequently during those hours. Games apps also peak
after standard work hours as we would expect, since that is proba-
bly the typical recreation time for most subscribers.
4.6 Device Patterns: Differences Across Plat-
forms
Finally, we compare smartphone app usage across different kinds
of devices. We expect that faster devices allow for longer sessions,
faster downloads, and more interactivity, thus enhancing the end-
user experience. Power users, who use their devices more, may also
gravitate to newer and faster devices. We focus on three different
devices from the same device family, as we expect device operat-
ing system to also affect overall usage patterns. We compare three
devices in the same device family but of different generations – we
term these device 2, device 3, and device 4 in Figure 1. Device 2
is a HSDPA category 6 device (capable of 3.6Mbps downlink rate),
and device 3 and device 4 are in HSDPA category 8 (capable of
7.2Mbps downlink) [24]. Device 2 and device 3 are not HSUPA
enabled while device 4 is HSUPA category 6 (capable of 5.76Mbps
uplink) [25].
For this analysis, we use slightly different metrics than we have
used in the rest of the paper, since our goal is to measure how long
a user interacts with the device, and compare these measurements
across different devices. For this, we deﬁne individual access time
and the individual trafﬁc volume to be the network access time
and the trafﬁc volume per ﬂow respectively. We use these metrics
for our analysis as we expect the individual access time to provide
a measure of how long a user spends with an app, and the indi-
vidual trafﬁc volume to reﬂect how much data is transferred each
time a user interacts with an app. Obviously not every ﬂow will be
