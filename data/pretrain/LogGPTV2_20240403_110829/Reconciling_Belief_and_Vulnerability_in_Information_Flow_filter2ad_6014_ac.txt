Table II summarizes the initial uncertainty about A when
the real correlation between the high level
input and the
extra observables is pρ1(b | a), pρ2(b | a), pρ3(b | a), and
pρ4(b | a) respectively. The correlation pρ1(b | a) means that
the adversary’s extra information is slightly noisy: when the
high input is an even (resp. odd) number, the extra observable
is usually (with probability 0.98) even (resp. odd). But with
a small probability the adversary is wrong as the parity
is reversed. The contrary holds for the second correlation
pρ2(b | a), that is the correlation is highly noisy. The third
correlation is not a noisy one and coincide with the adversary’s
assumed one: the adversary’s belief is therefore 100% accurate
since we assumed that the actual a priori distribution of A is
publicly-known. Finally, the last correlation pρ4(b | a) always
fools the attacker by reverting the parity. Note that in this last
case the adversary’s initial uncertainty is inﬁnite. This means
that it is impossible for her to guess the value of the secret in
one try when her initial belief is 100% inaccurate.
Then the following result holds.
Proposition 2: Let A be a random variable and B the
adversary’s extra information about A. Let (pβ(a), pβ(b | a)) be
the adversary’s belief, then
(cid:0) pβ(a), pβ(b | a)(cid:1) ∈ Beliefs⊥(A, B) implies H∞(A : B) = +∞.
Proof: Direct consequence of Proposition 1 and Deﬁni-
tion 4.
In order to avoid such inﬁnite values when computing
the reduction of uncertainty, we shall exclude 100% always
inaccurate beliefs. Thus we deﬁne admissible beliefs up to a
positive number ǫ so that we can approximate 100% always
inaccurate beliefs by making ǫ as close to zero as possible.
Deﬁnition 5: An adversary’s initial belief is ǫ-admissible
(0  H∞(A : B) when ρ ∈ {ρ1, ρ3} and H∞(A) 
maxa′∈A pρ(a′ | b) in order for (11) to holds; but this is im-
possible.
The next result shows that an ω-accurate belief impacts the
vulnerability of A in presence of extra information by a factor
at least ω.
Lemma 6: If the adversary’s initial belief is ω-accurate then
H∞(A : B) ≤ ω · H∞(A | B)
