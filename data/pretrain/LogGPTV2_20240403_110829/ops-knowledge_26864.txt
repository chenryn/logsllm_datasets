Assistant: Container Orchestration refers to the automation of container life cycle management, scheduling, load balancing, and security in large-scale, high-concurrency container deployment. Common container orchestration tools include Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, etc. Kubernetes is currently the most popular container orchestration tool, featuring high availability, scalability, flexibility, and open source, and is suitable for large-scale and complex distributed systems. Docker Swarm is Docker's native container orchestration tool, tightly integrated with Docker, easy to use, and suitable for small and simple container cluster deployment. Apache Mesos is a general-purpose distributed system kernel that can manage multiple types of applications and integrates with different container managers and frameworks for large-scale, complex distributed systems. Each container orchestration tool has its unique advantages and applicability in different scenarios, and it is necessary to select the appropriate tool according to the specific business requirements and technical architecture.
