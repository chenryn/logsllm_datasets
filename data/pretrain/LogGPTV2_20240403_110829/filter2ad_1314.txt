ABSTRACT
Smartphones are popular attack targets, but usually too
weak in applying common protection concepts. SKIMS de-
signs and implements a cooperative, cross-layer security sys-
tem for mobile devices. Detection mechanisms as well as a
proactive and reactive defense of attacks are core compo-
nents of this project.
In this demo, we show a compre-
hensive proof-of-concept of our approaches, which include
entropy-based malware detection, a mobile honeypot, and
spontaneous, socio-inspired trust establishment.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile, wireless-based end devices represent a signiﬁcant
part of our current networks, both with respect to the num-
ber of deployed equipment and their economic impact. Lim-
ited hardware resources and the per se unprotected trans-
mission medium air turn such devices into attractive targets
for attacks. These are additionally motivated because hand-
helds commonly store or exchange conﬁdential data (e.g.,
calendar, contact lists).
In contrast to wired end systems, mobile devices exhibit
three characteristic diﬀerences: (a) they normally are equipped
with several diﬀerent network interfaces; (b) their capabili-
ties are signiﬁcantly limited, so that they are not able to per-
manently maintain strong protection mechanisms; (c) phys-
ical vicinity with the help of appropriate access technologies
allow for the establishment of separate, cooperative delivery
structures. Mobile end devices, thus, need a lightweight,

environment-adaptive protection mechanism that exploits
the heterogeneous technologies available on-board.
In this demo, we present SKIMS, a digital immune sys-
tem for smartphones. Similar to the biological immune sys-
tem, our framework tries to protect the mobile device on
its own. In cases where this is insuﬃcient, cooperation be-
tween neighbors is established. For the detection and de-
fense, SKIMS is guided by the principles of infrastructureless
and lightweight approaches.
From a general perspective, we demonstrate a user-friendly
security system that independently estimates apparent and
existing threats. From a detailed perspective, we show (1)
entropy-based malware detection for zero-day shellcode, (2)
a mobile honeypot, (3) socio-inspired trust-establishment for
reliable ad hoc communication to protect the mobile, and (4)
secure data distribution using fountain coding.
2. SKIMS IN A NUTSHELL
The SKIMS protection system consists of multiple com-
ponents that allow for detection as well as proactive and
reactive defense of attacks. These are controlled by the mo-
bile sandbox. Mobiles are consumer devices. We therefore
hide most of the inherent complexity from the end user.
Detection—Malware Identiﬁcation We employ a statis-
tical analysis of the information content obtained from net-
work streams to detect potential anomalies in real-time.
Unlike previous work, our time-frequency analysis extracts
the non-stationary properties of entropy signals. From this
context-adaptive technique, we obtain a clear signature of
binary instructions and can also detect embedded shellcode.
Preliminary details of our approach are sketched in [2].
Detection—Mobile Honeypot A low-interaction honey-
pot collects suspicious connections.
It emulates multiple
network services (FTP, POP3, etc.) and collects valuable
information from the observed attacks.
It allows for uni-
versal deployment on mobiles as well as on common Linux
systems, which enables a comprehensive analysis of attacks
on multiple platforms.
Defense—Ad hoc Trust Establishment This component
evaluates spontaneous trust between peers to establish reli-
able ad hoc communication. Compared to other approaches,
our scheme [3] applies only data inherent at mobiles and does
not require any central component. Using a commutative
encryption protocol two peers exchange their address books
in a privacy-friendly way and ﬁnd mutual contacts without

revealing diﬀerent entries. Mutual entries will be weighted
locally using data from communication logs [4]. An overall,
transitive trust value is derived from sociological principles
(tie strengths).
Defense—Secure Data Transmission
This component
allows for a secure and reliable data broadcast between the
mobiles. It is achieved by adapting the techniques which are
originally proposed in [1] to mobile devices. The communi-
cation is based on fountain coding to increase the eﬃciency
in places where the connectivity is unreliable due to high
amount of wireless interferences. It enables the encrypted
distribution of any kind of data such as security logs and
programs to adjacent mobile devices running the SKIMS
app.
Controlling—SKIMS App
Each component for detec-
tion reports its current threat level to the SKIMS app, which
calculates an overall state. Depending on the severity, the
SKIMS app activates autonomously defense strategies or in-
teracts with the end user.
A core design objective while developing the SKIMS app
was the lightweight integration and interaction of the diﬀer-
ent building blocks. We implemented the internal signaling
based on a content provider.
3. DEMONSTRATION
Setup An attendee can test all SKIMS components, ei-
ther by itself or in combination. A typical procedure is the
following: The user starts with the threat level “no attacks”
(green) and may choose to download an uninfected or ma-
licious ﬁle via a QR code. The user observes the live en-
tropy analysis. In case of embedded malware, the SKIMS
app switches to yellow. From an external PC we emulate
an attack by connecting to the mobile and poke the local
ﬁle system. This is handled by the mobile honeypot, which
changes the current state to red. The user is asked to can-
cel its current Internet connection and to establish an ad
hoc link. The SKIMS app visualizes the spontaneous trust
calculation with an adjacent mobile.
On-Site Requirements
For our demonstration, we will
need a connection for power supply and a table. An Internet
connection is not required. We will bring an access point,
a notebook, multiple Android smartphones, and a tablet,
which will communicate among each other via 802.11.
