## Abstract
Smartphones are frequent targets for attacks, yet they often lack robust security measures. SKIMS (Security Kit for Intelligent Mobile Systems) is a cooperative, cross-layer security system designed for mobile devices. It includes detection mechanisms and both proactive and reactive defense strategies. This demonstration showcases a comprehensive proof-of-concept, featuring entropy-based malware detection, a mobile honeypot, and socio-inspired trust establishment.

## 1. Introduction
Mobile, wireless-based end devices are a significant part of our current networks, both in terms of deployment and economic impact. Limited hardware resources and the inherently insecure nature of wireless transmission make these devices attractive targets for attacks. Additionally, handheld devices often store or exchange confidential data, such as calendars and contact lists.

Compared to wired systems, mobile devices have three key differences:
1. They typically feature multiple network interfaces.
2. Their capabilities are limited, making it challenging to maintain strong, permanent protection mechanisms.
3. Physical proximity allows for the establishment of separate, cooperative delivery structures.

Therefore, mobile devices require a lightweight, environment-adaptive protection mechanism that leverages the heterogeneous technologies available on-board.

In this demo, we present SKIMS, a digital immune system for smartphones. Similar to a biological immune system, SKIMS aims to protect the device independently. When individual protection is insufficient, cooperation with neighboring devices is established. SKIMS is guided by the principles of infrastructureless and lightweight approaches.

From a general perspective, we demonstrate a user-friendly security system that independently assesses apparent and existing threats. Specifically, we show:
1. Entropy-based malware detection for zero-day shellcode.
2. A mobile honeypot.
3. Socio-inspired trust-establishment for reliable ad hoc communication.
4. Secure data distribution using fountain coding.

## 2. SKIMS in a Nutshell
The SKIMS protection system consists of multiple components for detection and both proactive and reactive defense. These components are controlled by a mobile sandbox, designed to hide complexity from the end user.

### Detection—Malware Identification
We use statistical analysis of network stream information to detect potential anomalies in real-time. Our time-frequency analysis extracts non-stationary properties of entropy signals, providing a clear signature of binary instructions and detecting embedded shellcode. Preliminary details are outlined in [2].

### Detection—Mobile Honeypot
A low-interaction honeypot collects suspicious connections by emulating multiple network services (e.g., FTP, POP3). It gathers valuable information from observed attacks and can be deployed universally on mobiles and common Linux systems, enabling comprehensive attack analysis across platforms.

### Defense—Ad Hoc Trust Establishment
This component evaluates spontaneous trust between peers to establish reliable ad hoc communication. Our scheme [3] uses only data inherent to mobiles and does not require any central component. Using a commutative encryption protocol, two peers exchange their address books privately and find mutual contacts without revealing different entries. Mutual entries are weighted locally using communication logs [4], and an overall, transitive trust value is derived from sociological principles (tie strengths).

### Defense—Secure Data Transmission
This component ensures secure and reliable data broadcast between mobiles using techniques adapted from [1]. Communication is based on fountain coding, which increases efficiency in areas with unreliable connectivity due to high wireless interference. It enables the encrypted distribution of data such as security logs and programs to adjacent mobile devices running the SKIMS app.

### Controlling—SKIMS App
Each detection component reports its current threat level to the SKIMS app, which calculates an overall state. Depending on the severity, the app autonomously activates defense strategies or interacts with the end user. The core design objective was the lightweight integration and interaction of different building blocks. Internal signaling is implemented based on a content provider.

## 3. Demonstration
### Setup
Attendees can test all SKIMS components individually or in combination. A typical procedure is as follows:
1. Start with the threat level "no attacks" (green).
2. Choose to download an uninfected or malicious file via a QR code.
3. Observe the live entropy analysis. If malware is detected, the SKIMS app switches to yellow.
4. From an external PC, emulate an attack by connecting to the mobile and probing the local file system. The mobile honeypot changes the state to red.
5. The user is prompted to disconnect from the Internet and establish an ad hoc link. The SKIMS app visualizes the spontaneous trust calculation with an adjacent mobile.

### On-Site Requirements
For the demonstration, we need:
- A power supply connection
- A table
- An access point
- A notebook
- Multiple Android smartphones
- A tablet
- Devices will communicate via 802.11

No Internet connection is required.
