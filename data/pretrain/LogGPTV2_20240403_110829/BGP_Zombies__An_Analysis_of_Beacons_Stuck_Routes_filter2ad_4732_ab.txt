Figure 2 depicts AS paths for the second outbreak in Fig. 1. Each node rep-
resents an AS and consecutive ASes in the AS paths are connected by an edge.
The green nodes represent RIS peers that have correctly withdrawn the preﬁx at
22:00. The red nodes represent zombie peers observed from 22:00 to 00:00. The
gray nodes represent ASes that are not peering with RIS collectors, hence we
have no direct observations for these ASes though they appear in collected AS

paths. Here, the three observed zombies share the same upstream provider which
is strong evidence that this provider and all its downstream ASes (depicted by
triangles in Fig. 2) are also zombies.
To systematically identify these clusters of zombies, we build such graphs for
each outbreak then we classify unknown ASes using the graph-based machine
learning technique described in the next section. The results of the classiﬁcation
are illustrated in Fig. 2 with the shape of the nodes: triangles represent detected
zombies; circles represent other ASes.
3.1 Graph-Based Semi-supervised Learning
Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning (G-SSL) is a generic framework per-
mitting eﬃcient classiﬁcation of graph nodes by jointly exploiting the graph
topology and prior information consisting of a small fraction of nodes being a
priori classiﬁed by experts [19] (i.e. RIS peers). There already exist several doc-
umented examples where G-SSL has outperformed other state-of-the-art clas-
siﬁcation strategies (e.g., BitTorrent content and user classiﬁcation [10], text
recognition [18], bio-medical diagnoses [21]).
Amongst the several versions of G-SSL, the PageRank-based G-SSL is a
popular and commonly used one [11]. It relies on a coding of the graph topology
via a speciﬁc operator, the (combinatorial) Laplacian L. Namely, let us consider
an N node undirected graph encoded by the adjacency matrix W , with Wi,j = 1
when nodes i and j are connected and 0 otherwise. Further, let di =
j Wij
denote the degree of node i, D = diag(d1, . . . , dN ) the diagonal matrix of vertex
degrees, and form L = D − W . The PageRank K-class classiﬁcation procedure
can be sketched as follows. The labeled information is encoded in a matrix Y ∈
N×K, where Yik = 1 if node i is declared by expert to belong to class k
R
and 0 elsewhere. In the present work, Y conveys the information provided by
RIS; normal and zombie peers are respectively coded as Yi1 = 1 and Yi2 = 1.
The classiﬁcation of the unlabeled nodes amounts to estimate a vectorial signal
X ∈ R
N×K on the graph as:
(cid:2)
(cid:3)
xT D
min
x
−1LD
−1x + μ (y − x)T
(cid:4)
−1 (y − x)
.
D
(1)
This functional minimization is known to have an analytical closed-form solution,
providing access to X, without recourse to a time/memory consuming iterative
minimization procedure:
X T = μ
μ + 2
(cid:5)
I − αD
−1W
(cid:6)−1
.
yT
(2)
Once X is computed, node i is assigned to the class k selected by argmaxkXik.
The hyper-parameter μ balances the conﬁdence granted to the expert knowl-
edge versus the information conveyed by the graph (and the graph Laplacian
L). It is tuned by means of a standard leave-one-out cross validation procedure,
tailored to the context of semi-supervised learning: From the set of documented

vertices, one element, per class, is selected as a labeled example, while the rest
is added to the group of not documented and used for validation. The procedure
is repeated and μ is selected as maximizing average detection performance.
3.2 Validation
G-SSL produces a list of zombie ASes that are not necessarily peering with RIS
collectors. To evaluate the classiﬁcation accuracy of G-SSL we performed timely
traceroute measurements from ASes found on the zombie paths and compared
the traceroute results with G-SSL results.
Our traceroute measurements are done with the RIPE Atlas measurement
platform [3]. We select ﬁve Atlas probes for each AS found in zombie paths, and
perform traceroutes towards the corresponding beacon preﬁx every 5 min until
the preﬁx is announced again.
Comparing traceroute results to G-SSL results requires certain precautions.
We intuitively expect routers from zombie ASes to forward traceroute pack-
ets and other routers to either drop these packets or return an ICMP network
unreachable error. However, the presence of default routes in intra-AS routing is
inevitably exhibiting router IP addresses although the AS border routers have
withdrawn the preﬁx. Another diﬃculty is to identify borders between two ASes
and avoid making wrong inferences when mapping IP addresses to AS numbers
[13,15].
To address both issues we employ the following heuristics. First, we discard
the ﬁrst public IP found in traceroutes as it usually stands for a gateway with
a default route. We group all traceroutes initiated from the same AS, if these
traceroutes consist only of ICMP network unreachable errors and unresponsive
routers then we consider that AS as normal, that is the AS has correctly with-
drawn the route and is not forwarding packets. For traceroutes with responsive
routers we retrieve the routers’ ASN using longest preﬁx match and compute FA,
the number of IP addresses from ASN A that forwarded packets, and, EA the
number of IP addresses from ASN A that sent an ICMP error. We consider an
AS A as zombie if the majority of its routers are forwarding packets, FA > EA.
The AS classiﬁcation using traceroutes and the observations from RIS peers
constitute the ground truth data we use to evaluate G-SSL results. For the
three measurement periods G-SSL retrieved 97% of the zombies identiﬁed in
the ground truth and 99% of the normal AS, which is more than acceptable for
the following characterization of zombies. Since G-SSL classiﬁes all nodes in the
graph, we also obtain 35% more classiﬁed ASes than using traceroutes and RIS
peers.
4 Zombie Characteristics
We now investigate temporal and topological characteristics of zombies directly
observed at RIS peers and those inferred using the G-SSL method. Our aim here
is to quantify the frequency of zombies, uncover their locality, and estimate the
scale of zombie outbreaks.

each RIS peer and beacon preﬁx.

4.1 Zombies Observed at RIS Peers
Starting with zombies observed at RIS peers, we compute the zombie emergence
rate, that is the number of times zombies are reported for each peer and each
beacon normalized by the number of times beacons have been withdrawn dur-
ing our measurement study. This metric corresponds to the likelihood of pair
(cid:3)peer, beacon(cid:4) to cause a zombie. Figure 3a depicts the distribution of the values
obtained with our dataset. We observe only 6.5% (cid:3)peer, beacon(cid:4) pairs with no
zombie during our entire measurement periods. However, zombies are uncom-
mon for RIS peers, 50% of the (cid:3)peer, beacon(cid:4) pairs have zombie entries for less
than 1.3% of the beacon withdraws (average value is 1.8% for IPv4 and 2.7%
for IPv6). We found some outlier values, meaning that a few RIS peers are more
prone to zombies, which is better understood with G-SSL results (Sect. 4.2).
We also compared the zombie AS paths to the paths that are advertised
before the beacon withdraw. For IPv4, 50% of the zombie paths are diﬀerent
than the paths that are used before the withdraw (69% for IPv6). Figure 3b
illustrates the distribution of path length for zombie paths, paths that were
previously advertised by zombie ASes (Normal path (zombie peer)), and paths
that were advertised by peers that correctly withdrawn the beacon (Normal path
(normal peer)). The distribution of zombie paths is clearly shifted to the right
hence zombie paths are usually longer. These observations imply that zombie
paths are mostly diﬀerent from the paths that are selected during BGP path
convergence, and numerous zombies appear during path hunting.
Then we examine if certain beacons are more prone to zombies. Figure 4a
shows the number of zombie outbreaks observed per beacon. On average we
detect about 200 outbreaks per beacon in our dataset. For IPv6 beacons
announced from DE-CIX in Frankfurt and VIX in Vienna are responsible for
the largest number of outbreaks. For IPv4 the beacon with the most outbreaks
is the one announced from both AMS-IX and NL-IX in Amsterdam. To under-
stand the relationship between zombies detected across the various beacons, we

compute the number of outbreaks that happened simultaneously but for diﬀer-
ent beacons. For 23% of instances where we detect IPv4 zombies (35% for IPv6)
we found zombies only for a single beacon. For IPv4 we also found multiple
instances (25%) where we detect simultaneous zombies outbreaks for all moni-
tored beacons. The rest of the distribution is uniform, meaning that we observe
little correlation between outbreaks on diﬀerent beacons. These observations
reveal that usually outbreaks emerge independently across diﬀerent preﬁxes, yet
in certain cases some peers altogether miss withdraws for all monitored beacons.
4.2 Zombies Beyond RIS Peers
Using G-SSL results we can explore the scale of zombie outbreaks beyond the
monitored RIS peers. For each zombie outbreak we count the total number of
ASes with detected zombies (i.e. zombies observed at RIS peers and zombies
inferred by G-SSL). On average, a zombie outbreak aﬀects 24 ASes for IPv4 and
30 ASes for IPv6, that is 10% of the IPv4 monitored ASes and 17% for IPv6.

for the legend.
However, the distribution of outbreak size is signiﬁcantly skewed (Fig. 5a).
The median outbreak size is 11 ASes for IPv4 and 16 ASes for IPv6. We also
observe a few instances where most of the monitored ASes are zombies due to
zombies that appeared close to the beacons’ origin AS or in large ISPs.
For IPv6 we found that a remarkably high number of outbreaks (63%) contain
between 12 and 19 ASes. For IPv4, the number of outbreaks with that particular
size is also signiﬁcant (18%), but we also observe a large proportion of smaller
