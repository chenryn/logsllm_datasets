APPENDIX A
In this paper, we carried out all the experiments using an
SDR device, USRP B210, and an ultra-wideband directional
antenna, RFSPACE UWB-3. As shown in Figure 15,
the
antenna is directly connected to the SDR device via a coaxial
cable without any other ampliﬁer/ﬁlter front-end modules in-
between. The bandwidth we need here is 25 MHz, and the
USRP B210 can provide 56 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth
in the frequency range of 70 MHz to 6 GHz, which is more
than sufﬁcient for our needs. The GNU Radio framework is
used to capture and process the signal of interest.
The modern-looking computer case with a translucent side
panel (which is acrylic) is AeroCool Cylon RGB Mid Tower.
The monitor is HP VH240A. The motherboard installed in this
case is ASUS PRIME Z270-P. The CPU used in this system
Fig. 15: Signal measurement equipment: USRP B210 and
RFSPACE UWB-3
is Intel i5-6500T. The power supply unit (PSU) installed in
this case is Apevia ATX-JP1000 Jupiter 1000W.
The all-metal computer case is Thermaltake Versa H22 Mid
Tower. The monitor is HP VH240A. The motherboard installed
in the case is ASRock Z270 Killer SLI. The CPU used in
this system is Intel i3-6100. The PSU installed in this case is
Thermaltake Smart 700W.
When we performed the experiments reported in Sec-
tion IV-C, we used AMD GPU driver for Linux (AMDGPU
20.20) to set the performance level to the second lowest one.
However, NVIDIA GPU driver does not allow us to ﬁx the
GPU to a speciﬁc performance level except for the highest
one. To ensure the appearance of the signals of interest, we
played YouTube videos to make sure that the performance
level bumps up to the second lowest one frequently.
APPENDIX B
Here we use an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of
using the techniques described in Section V to overcome the
relatively low SNR issue. We use AMD RX 5700 and Linux
OS in this example.

Fig. 16: Spectrogram corresponding to a scenario where the
periodic performance level change is invisible
We have RX 5700 in the all-metal computer case, and place
it far away from the antenna (about 6 meters). We make a
script which uses the AMD GPU driver to periodically switch
the performance level between the lowest and the second
lowest. Figure 16 shows the corresponding spectrogram. On
the spectrogram, we cannot visibly ﬁnd any patterns of stripe
appearance. If we simply use such spectrograms for attacks
like website ﬁngerprinting, it is very unlikely that the attacks
can be successfully mounted.
By contrast, Figure 17 shows the time series derived using
the techniques described in Section V. From the ﬁgure, we
can clearly see the designed periodic peak appearance pattern.

APPENDIX C
Given a target GPU, there may be some other GPUs close to
it, and they all have the same second lowest WCK frequency.
In such a scenario, an attacker can ﬁrst try to avoid picking
up the disturbing signals emitted from the nearby GPUs by
an appropriate placement of the directional antenna. We have
experimentally veriﬁed this against the following setup – two
RX 580 machines are placed close to each other (less than 1
meter apart), where one of them is the target that has a cursor
blinking in the Google search box and the other one plays a
Youtube video; and the directional antenna is placed 3 meters
away from both machines. We conﬁrm that we can ﬁnd several
appropriate placements to pick up only the signals of interest
of the target, and the corresponding spectrogram is shown in
Figure 18 (A).

Fig. 18: Examples of dealing with disturbing signals generated
by nearby GPUs
Nevertheless, the attacker may be restricted from arbitrarily
positioning the antenna, and therefore the signals emitted from
the nearby GPUs may be picked up clearly that can strongly
contaminate the spectrum. Continuing with the example above,
Figure 18 (B) shows the spectrogram where we have signals of
both RX 580 GPUs picked up. Compared to Figure 18 (A), we
can see that the desired pattern becomes hardly recognizable.
Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the time series derivation technique
described in Section V-A can help us precisely separate signals
generated by multiple identical or similar GPUs. The reason is
that, due to oscillator imperfection, the fc of a GPU is nearly
unique and often differs from the fc of another one by several
kHz, namely multiple kth DFT bins for the fc can be found and
subsequently multiple independent S[k] traces will be derived.
In our example, the two fc’s are separated by 12.6 kHz (i.e.,
126 bins given 100 Hz resolution) and the signals can be fully
separated as shown by the bottom part of Figure 18 (B).
APPENDIX D
For classifying time series data in our website ﬁngerprinting
attack, we directly use the residual network (ResNet) model
proposed in [59]. Its architecture is duplicated here in Fig-
ure 19. The details about the model can be found in [59] and its
code repository (https://github.com/cauchyturing/UCR Time
Series Classiﬁcation Deep Learning Baseline).
