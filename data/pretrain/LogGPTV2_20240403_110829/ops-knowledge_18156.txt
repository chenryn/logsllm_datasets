User: How to monitor and manage disk capacity on Linux system? Please provide relevant commands and operation steps.
Assistant: On the Linux system, you can use the following commands to monitor and manage disk capacity: 1. df command: used to display information such as disk usage and free space. For example, enter the df -h command to display the usage of each partition on the disk, where the -h option can display the displayed results in a user-friendly way: ``` $ df -h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on devtmpfs 3.8G 0 3.8G 0% /dev tmpfs 3.8G 8.0K 3.8G 1% /dev/shm tmpfs 3.8G 1.6M 3.8G 1% /run tmpfs 3.8G 0 3.8G 0% /sys/fs/cgroup /dev/ sda2 126G 31G 89G 26% / /dev/sda1 252M 192K 252M 1% /boot/efi tmpfs 773M 36K 773M 1% /run/user/1000 ``` 2. du command: used to measure the size of a directory or folder. For example, enter the du -sh * command to display the size and scale unit of all folders in the current directory: ``` $ du -sh * 6.3M bin 231M home 48M lib 3.5M lib64 16K lost+found 8.0K media 4.0K mnt 114M opt du: cannot access 'proc/16929/task/16929/fd/4': No such file or directory du: cannot access 'proc/16929/task/16929/fdinfo/4': No such file or directory du : cannot access 'proc/16929/fd/4': No such file or directory du: cannot access 'proc/16929/fdinfo/4': No such file or directory 0 proc 1.5M root 14M sbin 8.0K snap 4.0K srv 0 sys 8.7M tmp 3.8G usr 2.1G var ``` 3. lsblk command: used to display all block device information of the system, including hard disk, U disk, CD-ROM, etc. For example, enter the lsblk command to display all block devices in the current system, including their size, partition, file system and other information: ``` $ lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sda 8:0 0 149.1G 0 disk ├ ─sda1 8:1 0 260M 0 part /boot/efi └─sda2 8:2 0 148.8G 0 part / sdb 8:16 0 7.5G 0 disk /media/anon/UBUNTU 20_0 ``` 4. fuser command: use Used to find and terminate processes that are accessing a device or file. For example, enter the fuser -m /mnt/data command to find and terminate processes that are accessing the /mnt/data directory: ``` $ fuser -m /mnt/data/ /mnt/data/: 11232 $ sudo kill 11232 `` ` 5. mount and umount commands: used to mount and unmount file systems. For example, enter the command mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb to mount the U disk to the /mnt/usb directory: ``` $ mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb ``` Enter the command umount /mnt/usb You can unmount the U disk on the /mnt/usb directory: ``` $ umount /mnt/usb ``` The above commands can help us better monitor and manage the disk capacity of the Linux system.
