## Expected Behavior
Component Demos should be present on the corresponding Component API sections.
## Current Behavior
Component Demos and Component API are separated in docs.
## Context
While reading the docs https://material-ui.com/, I find myself with two
windows open, the Component Demo and the corresponding Component API. I see
the two sections aren't exactly 1:1, however I'm guessing the goal is to have
a demo for every Component.
There will be a need for compositional demos, much like Semantic's Views docs.
These demos can be linked to on each Component API doc page and indexed in a
Composed Components top level nav.
