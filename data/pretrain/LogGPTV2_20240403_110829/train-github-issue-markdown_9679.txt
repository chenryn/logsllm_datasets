Would be nice to have a core directive to create generic variable contexts at
the template.
Example of implementation:

This has some benefits like:
  * Shortcuts for long data structures and/or constant use of pipes:
      {{user.name}}
      {{user.age}}
      {{user.email}}
  * Avoid multiple observer subscriptions at the same template:
      {{user.name}}
      {{user.age}}
      {{user.email}}
