### Extreme IP Backtracing
**By Lawrence Baldwin & Jaeson Schultz**

#### Introduction
When you experience a cyber-attack, it's crucial to understand that most attackers do not launch their attacks directly from their own systems. Instead, they often use compromised, insecure systems on the Internet to perform untraceable, indirect attacks. This makes it challenging to identify the true source of an attack.

#### Key Objectives
To improve overall Internet security, we must:
- **Reduce the number of compromised hosts.**
- **Minimize the duration for which any system remains compromised.**

Protecting ourselves means ensuring others are also protected. When your firewall or intrusion detection system logs an event, consider it a potential cry for help from a victim whose system has been compromised and is being controlled by an attacker.

#### Notifying Victims
In a recent incident, myNetWatchman detected a host infected with the Microsoft SQL Spida Worm. A backtrace of the offending IP address revealed interesting results. For example, one of the IP addresses traced back to the Nuclear Safety Authority of Russia (GAN). 

This highlights the importance of notifying victims. As noted in a CNN.com article about the February 2000 DDoS attacks on Yahoo, eBay, Amazon.com, and E*Trade, authorities found that the servers used in the attacks belonged to users who were unaware their resources were being exploited.

#### The Backtracing Process
##### Source IP Validation
1. **Confirm the Source of Traffic:**
   - **Local Network**
   - **Extended Local Network** (e.g., cable modem neighbor)
   - **Internet**

2. **Exclude Invalid IP Addresses:**
   - **Martian Addresses:** Routers should not forward packets with invalid IP source addresses. (RFC1812, Section 5.3.7)
     - **Broadcast:** 0.0.0.0/8
     - **Loopback:** 127.0.0.0/8
     - **Multicast:** 224.0.0.0/4
     - **Limited Broadcast:** 255.255.255.255/32

3. **Exclude Private IP Addresses:**
   - The IANA has reserved the following blocks for private internets:
     - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
     - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
     - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

4. **Exclude IANA Reserved Addresses:**
   - Examples include:
     - 1.0.0.0 - 1.255.255.255
     - 2.0.0.0 - 2.255.255.255
     - 14.0.0.0 - 14.255.255.255
     - 128.0.0.0 - 128.0.255.255
     - 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
     - 192.0.0.0 - 192.0.127.255
     - 192.88.99.0 - 192.88.99.255
     - 197.0.0.0 - 197.255.255.255
     - 201.0.0.0 - 201.255.255.255
     - 221.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255

5. **Note Potentially Bogus IPs:**
   - Improbable octet sequences (e.g., 1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8)
   - Common nmap decoy addresses (e.g., 24.24.24.24, 23.23.23.23)

##### Spoof Detection
- **Traceroute Hop Count:**
  1. Calculate the *implied* hop count: `Original packet TTL - Final TTL`
  2. Perform a traceroute to the IP and get the *actual* hop count.
  3. If the implied and actual hop counts differ significantly, the IP may be spoofed.

- **Default TTL Values:**
  - Different operating systems have different default TTL values, which can help in identifying potential spoofing. For example:
    - **AIX:** 60 (TCP), 30 (UDP)
    - **FreeBSD 2.1R:** 64 (TCP/UDP)
    - **HP/UX 9.0x:** 30 (TCP/UDP)
    - **Linux:** 64 (TCP/UDP)
    - **Solaris 2.x:** 255 (TCP/UDP)
    - **Windows 95:** 32 (TCP/UDP)
    - **Windows NT 4.0:** 128 (TCP/UDP)

- **Traceroute Hop Count Difficulties:**
  - Traceroute may show unexpected hops, indicating potential issues with the route or possible spoofing.

##### Route Validation
- **Looking Glass Sites:**
  - These sites allow you to access the routing table on a core router, helping you determine if any routes exist to the IP address in question. An example is [Above.net's Looking Glass](http://lg.above.net/).

By following these steps, you can more effectively trace and validate the source of an attack, ultimately contributing to a more secure Internet environment.
