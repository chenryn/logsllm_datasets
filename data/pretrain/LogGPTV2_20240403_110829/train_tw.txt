of using any functionality that is available via the vdso.
.pp
why does the vdso exist at all?
there are some system calls the kernel provides that
user-space code ends up using frequently,
to the point that such calls can dominate overall performance.
this is due both to the frequency of the call as well as the
context-switch overhead that results
from exiting user space and entering the kernel.
.pp
the rest of this documentation is geared toward the curious and/or
c library writers rather than general developers.
if you're trying to call the vdso in your own application rather than using
the c library, you're most likely doing it wrong.
.ss example background
making system calls can be slow.
in x86 32-bit systems, you can trigger a software interrupt
.ri ( "int $0x80" )
to tell the kernel you wish to make a system call.
however, this instruction is expensive: it goes through
the full interrupt-handling paths
in the processor's microcode as well as in the kernel.
newer processors have faster (but backward incompatible) instructions to
initiate system calls.
rather than require the c library to figure out if this functionality is
available at run time,
the c library can use functions provided by the kernel in
the vdso.
.pp
note that the terminology can be confusing.
on x86 systems, the vdso function
used to determine the preferred method of making a system call is
named "__kernel_vsyscall", but on x86-64,
the term "vsyscall" also refers to an obsolete way to ask the kernel
what time it is or what cpu the caller is on.
.pp
one frequently used system call is
.br gettimeofday (2).
this system call is called both directly by user-space applications
as well as indirectly by
the c library.
think timestamps or timing loops or polling\(emall of these
frequently need to know what time it is right now.
this information is also not secret\(emany application in any
privilege mode (root or any unprivileged user) will get the same answer.
thus the kernel arranges for the information required to answer
this question to be placed in memory the process can access.
now a call to
.br gettimeofday (2)
changes from a system call to a normal function
call and a few memory accesses.
.ss finding the vdso
the base address of the vdso (if one exists) is passed by the kernel to
each program in the initial auxiliary vector (see
.br getauxval (3)),
via the
.b at_sysinfo_ehdr
tag.
.pp
you must not assume the vdso is mapped at any particular location in the
user's memory map.
the base address will usually be randomized at run time every time a new
process image is created (at
.br execve (2)
time).
this is done for security reasons,
to prevent "return-to-libc" attacks.
.pp
for some architectures, there is also an
.b at_sysinfo
tag.
this is used only for locating the vsyscall entry point and is frequently
omitted or set to 0 (meaning it's not available).
this tag is a throwback to the initial vdso work (see
.ir history
below) and its use should be avoided.
.ss file format
since the vdso is a fully formed elf image, you can do symbol lookups on it.
this allows new symbols to be added with newer kernel releases,
and allows the c library to detect available functionality at
run time when running under different kernel versions.
oftentimes the c library will do detection with the first call and then
cache the result for subsequent calls.
.pp
all symbols are also versioned (using the gnu version format).
this allows the kernel to update the function signature without breaking
backward compatibility.
this means changing the arguments that the function accepts as well as the
return value.
thus, when looking up a symbol in the vdso,
you must always include the version
to match the abi you expect.
.pp
typically the vdso follows the naming convention of prefixing
all symbols with "__vdso_" or "__kernel_"
so as to distinguish them from other standard symbols.
for example, the "gettimeofday" function is named "__vdso_gettimeofday".
.pp
you use the standard c calling conventions when calling
any of these functions.
no need to worry about weird register or stack behavior.
.sh notes
.ss source
when you compile the kernel,
it will automatically compile and link the vdso code for you.
you will frequently find it under the architecture-specific directory:
.pp
    find arch/$arch/ \-name \(aq*vdso*.so*\(aq \-o \-name \(aq*gate*.so*\(aq
.\"
.ss vdso names
the name of the vdso varies across architectures.
it will often show up in things like glibc's
.br ldd (1)
output.
the exact name should not matter to any code, so do not hardcode it.

.ss strace(1), seccomp(2), and the vdso
when tracing systems calls with
.br strace (1),
symbols (system calls) that are exported by the vdso will
.i not
appear in the trace output.
those system calls will likewise not be visible to
.br seccomp (2)
filters.
.sh architecture-specific notes
the subsections below provide architecture-specific notes
on the vdso.
.pp
note that the vdso that is used is based on the abi of your user-space code
and not the abi of the kernel.
thus, for example,
when you run an i386 32-bit elf binary,
you'll get the same vdso regardless of whether you run it under
an i386 32-bit kernel or under an x86-64 64-bit kernel.
therefore, the name of the user-space abi should be used to determine
which of the sections below is relevant.

as this cpu lacks a memory management unit (mmu),
it doesn't set up a vdso in the normal sense.
instead, it maps at boot time a few raw functions into
a fixed location in memory.
user-space applications then call directly into that region.
there is no provision for backward compatibility

the itanium port is somewhat tricky.

(also known as "fast syscalls" or "fsys").
you can invoke these via the

vdso helper.

the parisc port has a code page with utility functions

rather than use the normal elf auxiliary vector approach,
it passes the address of
the page to the process via the sr2 register.
the permissions on the page are such that merely executing those addresses
automatically executes with kernel privileges and not in user space.
this is done to match the way hp-ux works.

since it's just a raw page of code, there is no elf information for doing

the vdso was originally just a single function\(emthe vsyscall.
in older kernels, you might see that name
in a process's memory map rather than "vdso".
