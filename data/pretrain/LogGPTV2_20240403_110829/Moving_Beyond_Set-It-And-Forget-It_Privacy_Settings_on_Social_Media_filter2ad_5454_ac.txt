old posts’ visibility. While only 19.2% of our participants reported
that they remembered using that tool, they could have forgotten
having done so, or they could have restricted posts manually. Such
a significant change in privacy settings constitutes a major incident
regarding retrospective privacy. Unfortunately, “limit past posts”
can only restrict widely shared (e.g., “public”) posts to “friends
only.” It is an incredibly blunt tool and cannot capture subtle, and
sometimes important, retrospective privacy decisions.
6.4 Desired Privacy Settings
Table 3 presents the results of asking whether participants wish to
change the privacy settings for five randomly selected Facebook
posts. We exclude one post where the participant preferred not to
answer about his desired setting. We make two observations from
this table. First, while a majority of existing privacy settings for
290 old posts (74.5%) do not require changes, 65.3% of participants
wanted to change at least one post’s privacy setting. The gray-
colored cells of Table 3 indicate posts where participants did not
want to change their current privacy settings. Second, we found that
preferred changes in settings are roughly split between increasing
and decreasing the audience size. Earlier work [6] reported similar
results. Interestingly, even for two posts currently shared with cus-
tom settings, the participants wanted to share them with different
custom settings containing smaller audiences.
The red and blue shaded regions in Table 3 indicate a decreased or
increased audience, respectively. When we asked participants why
they want to change their privacy setting, the most common reasons
were that the post was not appropriate (18 posts), it was irrelevant
(16), and they did not care who was able to see that specific post
(14). When participants wanted to increase the post audience, they
mentioned that it was because it contained public information or a
general message that they would like more individuals to see.
When participants were asked how important it was to change
each post’s privacy setting, 65 changes were of only slight or no im-
portance, and 34 changes were of extreme or moderate importance.
If participants felt that changing the privacy setting of a post was
extremely important, they often attributed this to the post being
inappropriate or containing private information. If participants felt
that it would be very or moderately important to change privacy
settings, appropriateness was still an important rationale. For in-
stance, one participant commented, “It was a trip with my ex, I doubt
my fiancee wants to see that.”
6.5 Reasons for Retrospective Changes
Participants indicated that they wish to change the privacy settings
of 25.5% of their old posts. In this section, we further investigate
how they came to these conclusions.
6.5.1 Retrospectively Browsing Old Facebook Posts. To gain insight
into abstract concerns regarding others browsing old posts, we
asked participants about their perception of, and participation in,

vious years for the 55 accounts at least 10 years old.
friend-addition timestamps in the activity log). The boxes represent
quartiles. We observe a very substantial increase in the audience im-
plicitly included in the most common “friends only” privacy setting.
Compared to 2018, the median participant had under half as many
friends in 2012, and under one-quarter as many in 2009. Figure 13 in
the appendix is an analogous graph for all 78 participants, showing
an even more pronounced trend.
Offline Events Affect Facebook Usage: A Facebook user’s life
changes impact which privacy settings they desire [4, 6]. 56.4% of
our participants mentioned that life events affected their sharing
decisions. Specifically, they reported that their sharing on Facebook
was affected by personal (30 participants), professional (10), and
global (18) events. Relationship changes (10) and childbirth (7) were
the most frequently mentioned personal changes. Career changes
(3) and issues with a coworker (3) were the most frequently men-
tioned professional changes. Finally, elections (6) and news about
data breaches (6) were the most frequently mentioned global events
motivating changes. Some of these events led to fewer personal
posts on Facebook (reported by 13 of the 30 participants with per-
sonal changes and 3 of the 10 with professional changes).
Usage of Privacy Features: We also investigated usage of Face-
book’s own retrospective privacy features. 59% of participants re-
ported that they had seen Facebook’s “privacy checkup” tool when
we showed them a picture of it, and 44.9% reported that they had
used the privacy checkup. These high percentages are consistent
with a 2018 Reuters/Ipsos survey that reported 74% of U.S. Facebook
users were aware of their current Facebook privacy settings [63].
Similarly, 53.8% of our participants reported seeing the “limit past
audience” feature. However, only 19.2% recalled using it.
6.3 Privacy Settings Over Time
Figure 3 shows the distribution of privacy settings for participants’
posts made each year from 2009 to 2018. The x-axis labels indicate
the total number of posts made each year. The result is similar if
we include shorter-lived accounts (Figure 14 in the appendix).
We found that friends was by far the most used privacy setting,
even for posts made pre-2011 when posts were public by default.
This finding appears to contradict earlier work from Liu et al. that
found that the public setting is most heavily used on Facebook [47].
Note that Liu et al. also used Mechanical Turk, surveying 200 users.
If both our and Liu et al.’s samples are sufficiently representative,

need for changes when users were already actively managing their

And while only 9 participants (11.5%) reported that they would feel

and 18 (23.1%) reported checking their friends’ three-year-old posts.
Moreover, a small number of our participants self-reported arguably
invasive behaviors in browsing friends’ profiles, including checking
relationship history (1 participant), stalking (3), fact-checking (1),
and digging up family information (2). These intentions certainly
motivate retrospective control of post privacy for even the most
slightly privacy-conscious Facebook user.
7 PRIVACY PREFERENCES’ CORRELATIONS
Our study is unique among research on social media privacy in
its combination of temporal reach (with the median participant’s
account being 10 years old) and the fine-grained nature of the data,
contextualizing privacy preferences within the participant’s full
timeline and evolution of their set of Facebook friends. Here, we
explore correlations between retrospective privacy preferences for
continuing to share given posts with given Facebook friends based
on both how frequently the two users visibly interact on Facebook
and when that relationship was added on Facebook.
6.5.2 Effectiveness of Existing Mechanisms. Finally, we evaluated
the effectiveness of Facebook’s current privacy-management mech-
anisms by checking for a correlation between whether a post’s
existing and desired privacy settings differ and whether the cor-
responding participant had used an existing privacy-preserving
mechanism. We used the χ2 test [60] or Fisher’s exact test [25],
depending on the amount of data available for the individual test.
We did not find any significant correlations between the frequency
with which participants wanted to change the privacy settings on
old posts and their use of various privacy-preserving mechanisms
(removing a friend, changing the audience of a past post, and using
the “privacy checkup” [21] or “limit past posts” [18] features).
