User: I'm trying to programatically get a list of installed fonts in C or Python. I need to be able to do this on OS X, does anyone know how?
Assistant: Do you want to write a program to do it, or do you want to use a program to do it?  There are many programs that list fonts, xlsfonts comes to mind.
