Assistant: This log chunk shows the system assigning tasks 78 and 79, storing broadcast variables in memory, finding blocks locally, and running tasks 0.0, 1.0, 3.0, and 4.0. It also shows the system calculating the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task, and sending the results to the driver.
