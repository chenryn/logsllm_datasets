allow researchers to conduct network experiments over wireless-
equipped probes. For example, vantage points of publicly-accessible
large-scale measurement platforms (such as RIPE Atlas, PlanetLab)
are majorly deployed in fixed managed networks [14]. As a result,
most research relies on setting up custom, short-lived, measurement
platform targeting limited geographical regions [65, 89]. However,
understanding the impact of the wireless last-mile from a global
perspective has become an increasingly important factor in assess-
ing cloud access latency; specially because cloud providers do not
have much influence on this part of the connection as it is mainly
controlled by regional Internet service providers (ISPs).
In this work, we leverage Speedchecker’s extensive network of
wireless-enabled vantage points to plug this gap in this field of
research. Being a commercial measurement platform, only limited
studies have utilized Speedchecker in the past [7, 8, 34]. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to estimate the impact
and consistency of the WiFi and cellular link while accessing the
compute infrastructure of popular cloud providers globally (§5).
2.3 Cloud Peering Interconnections
Despite significant investment in infrastructure and private WAN
deployment, part of traffic to cloud network is handled by ten-
ant’s serving ISP. To gain more control of their client path into
64
their managed network, cloud operators leverage several inter-
connection approaches to bypass the public Internet altogether
– resulting in the Internet “flattening” [9]. One possibility is us-
ing cloud exchanges [91], IXPs [15], and colocation facilities [47]
which facilitate dedicated peering interconnections within managed
third-party datacenter environments. For such interconnections,
cloud providers get into a contractual agreement with service ISPs
globally by signing a Letter of Authority and Customer Facility
Assignment (LOA-CFA) [39]. This allows cloud providers to bypass
any inbound tenant traffic originating from those service providers
the transit providers altogether [9]. Direct peering enables cloud
providers to skip many ASes on a path, thus allowing them to con-
trol a significant portion of their tenant connection and achieve
high reliability and reduced latency [40].
If the tenant ISP prefers to not directly peer with the cloud
provider, they can privately peer at the premises of a third-party
transit provider hosting an edge point-of-presence (PoP) for that
cloud [38]. These entities offer secure and private layer-3 connec-
tivity and can be used by several cloud providers. Such interconnec-
tions are commonly referred to as Private Network Interconnects
(PNI) [2, 38] and allows cloud providers to circumvent tenant-side
regional transit connections, offering a much shorter path to their
private WANs. For example, Arnold et al. [9] found networks of
hypergiant cloud providers, i.e., Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, to
have significantly high reachability with ASes globally, allowing
them to be increasingly independent of Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs for
transporting their traffic in the Internet. Paths without any special
peering setup traverse the regular hierarchical public Internet.
Previous works have studied the impact of peering relationships
by triggering active measurements from within cloud provider net-
works [9, 90], colocation facilities [63] and edge PoPs [74]. Arnold
et al. [8] investigated the private WAN offerings within Amazon and
Google networks. While the focus of [8] was to isolate the impact
of cloud private WANs on routing in the Internet, we concentrate
on uncovering possible QoS advantages enjoyed by cloud providers
with (to without) private WANs from an end-user’s perspective.
Our study extends their efforts by making a wider endpoint selec-
tion that includes datacenters from nine different cloud providers –
both with and without a private WAN deployment (see §6).
3 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
3.1 End-Points Selection
Since the aim of our analysis is to provide a comprehensive analysis
of cloud reachability and factors affecting it globally, our provider
selection was influenced by factors such as geographical presence,
private WAN deployment, etc. We chose 195 cloud regions operated
by nine different cloud providers as end-points, namely, Amazon,
Google, Microsoft Azure, IBM, Oracle, Alibaba, DigitalOcean, Lin-
ode, and Vultr. Table 1 shows the distribution of our endpoints
across continents, and Figure 1a shows their deployment density
across the globe. For every provider, we filtered cloud regions that
support compute services (e.g., Amazon ec2, Google compute en-
gine, etc.) and retrieved the hostname of a public VM hosted in that
region by CloudHarmony [20]. Some providers, such as Amazon,
Google, Microsoft, etc., have built massive private WANs to shield
tenant traffic from public Internet [76]. Furthermore, as discussed

public paths [44]. Table 1 also shows whether a cloud provider has a
fully-private (Private), private within a continent (Semi), or a public
Internet-based (Public) network backbone. We also include data-
centers operated by Alibaba Cloud due to their immense presence
in Asia, especially concentrated in China [3].
3.2 Vantage Points Selection
Speechecker vantage points. The primary source of data col-
lection in this study comes from our experiments over vantage
points (VP) from Speedchecker platform [52]. Speedchecker is a
global measurement platform that hosts several hundred thousand
softwareized probes in over 170 countries; almost all of which are
deployed exclusively in user devices and closely reflect true end-
user experience. The platform allows researchers to use an API
to trigger and record active network measurements (traceroute,
ping, HTTP GET, etc.) [51]. Probes on Speedchecker are divided into
three broad categories based on their operating platform - router,
PC, and Android. For our experiments, we only utilized Android
probes due to two reasons. First, we found that throughout our
measurement campaign, Android VPs had the largest share of the
total probes on the platform (≈ 89%) - around 470,000 probes de-
ployed globally, of which at least 29,000 were available at any given
time. Second, we verified from Speedchecker management team
that the majority of Android probes are deployed in real user mo-
bile phones and thus rely on wireless last-mile (WiFi/cellular) to
connect to the Internet. Throughout our measurement period, we
used upwards of 115,000 Speedchecker probes distributed in over
140 countries worldwide, the country-wise distribution of which is
shown in Figure 1b (refer to Appendix A.1 for deployment density
based distribution of VPs used in this study).
RIPE Atlas Dataset: We correlate and compare our active mea-
surements over Speedchecker to cloud reachability study over RIPE
Atlas platform [66] conducted by Corneo et al. [22]. RIPE Atlas is a
global Internet measurement platform, driven by network enthusi-
asts, that includes thousands of small hardware and software probes
deployed across the globe. The dataset includes ICMP pings and
TCP traceroutes collected from over 8500+ Atlas probes to the same
set of cloud regions shown in Table 1. Corneo et al. conducted the
study between September 2019 to September 2020, and the 60GB+
Figure 2: Distribution of 8500+ RIPE Atlas probes used by
Corneo et al. [22].
in §2.3, these providers also deploy edge PoPs and sign contractual
agreements with ISPs across the globe to directly peer user traffic
into their WAN, avoiding transit paths altogether (we analyze the
impact of such peering agreements on cloud reachability and path
ownership in §6) [8, 19]. On the other hand, small-to-medium-sized
providers such as Vultr and Linode, rely heavily on the public Inter-
net for transporting their traffic horizontally (between datacenters)
and vertically (between users and datacenters) [22]. Providers, such
as DigitalOcean and IBM, only establish private backbones in cer-
tain geographical regions and use private interconnects to avoid

dataset includes ≈ 4M unique probe-to-cloud paths and ≈2.3M ping
data points. The dataset is available publicly at [30].
Speedchecker VP coverage is significantly higher than RIPE
Atlas. Throughout our measurement study, we found that the num-
ber of connected Speedchecker probes consistently surpassed those
of RIPE Atlas. For example, while RIPE Atlas offers ≈ 9K+ active
probes, Speedchecker allows researchers to utilize ≈ 29K+ probes
at any given time out of its 115K total available probes. More im-
portantly, the geographical deployment density and availability
of Speedchecker is much more comprehensive. The geographic
distribution of Speedchecker and RIPE Atlas probes used in our
study is shown in Figure 1b and 2 respectively. While VPs from
both platforms are highly concentrated within Europe and North
America, Speedchecker’s probe density per geographical distance
(a.k.a. geoDensity) is almost 12× in EU and 6× in NA compared
to Atlas. Additionally, unlike Atlas, Speedchecker has at least 200
VPs in almost all countries within these two continents. Germany,
Great Britain, Iran, and Japan have the densest VP coverage in
Speedchecker, boasting of 5,000+ available probes. The platform’s
coverage advantage is especially evident in developing regions
of the globe, i.e., countries in SA, Africa, and Asia, where probe
geoDensity is 30-40× higher than RIPE Atlas. However, despite
significant availability, VP coverage of both platforms within these
regions is relatively sparse, with most probes concentrated in only
