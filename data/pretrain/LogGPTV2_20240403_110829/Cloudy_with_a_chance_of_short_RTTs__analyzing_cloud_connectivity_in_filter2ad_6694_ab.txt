### Allowing Network Experiments Over Wireless-Equipped Probes

Publicly accessible large-scale measurement platforms, such as RIPE Atlas and PlanetLab, predominantly deploy vantage points in fixed, managed networks [14]. Consequently, most research relies on setting up custom, short-lived measurement platforms targeting limited geographical regions [65, 89]. However, understanding the impact of the wireless last-mile from a global perspective has become increasingly important for assessing cloud access latency. This is particularly significant because cloud providers have limited control over this part of the connection, which is primarily managed by regional Internet service providers (ISPs).

In this work, we leverage Speedchecker’s extensive network of wireless-enabled vantage points to address this gap in research. Although Speedchecker is a commercial measurement platform, only a few studies have utilized it in the past [7, 8, 34]. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to estimate the impact and consistency of WiFi and cellular links while accessing the compute infrastructure of popular cloud providers globally (§5).

### Cloud Peering Interconnections

Despite significant investments in infrastructure and private WAN deployment, a portion of traffic to cloud networks is still handled by tenants' serving ISPs. To gain more control over their clients' paths into their managed networks, cloud operators use several interconnection approaches to bypass the public Internet, leading to the "flattening" of the Internet [9]. One approach involves using cloud exchanges [91], IXPs [15], and colocation facilities [47], which facilitate dedicated peering interconnections within managed third-party datacenter environments. For such interconnections, cloud providers enter into contractual agreements with service ISPs globally by signing a Letter of Authority and Customer Facility Assignment (LOA-CFA) [39]. This allows cloud providers to bypass any inbound tenant traffic originating from those service providers, thus skipping many ASes on the path and achieving high reliability and reduced latency [40].

If the tenant ISP prefers not to directly peer with the cloud provider, they can privately peer at the premises of a third-party transit provider hosting an edge point-of-presence (PoP) for that cloud [38]. These entities offer secure and private layer-3 connectivity and can be used by several cloud providers. Such interconnections are commonly referred to as Private Network Interconnects (PNIs) [2, 38] and allow cloud providers to circumvent tenant-side regional transit connections, offering a much shorter path to their private WANs. For example, Arnold et al. [9] found that the networks of hypergiant cloud providers, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, have significantly high reachability with ASes globally, allowing them to be increasingly independent of Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs for transporting their traffic in the Internet. Paths without any special peering setup traverse the regular hierarchical public Internet.

Previous works have studied the impact of peering relationships by triggering active measurements from within cloud provider networks [9, 90], colocation facilities [63], and edge PoPs [74]. Arnold et al. [8] investigated the private WAN offerings within Amazon and Google networks. While their focus was on isolating the impact of cloud private WANs on routing in the Internet, we concentrate on uncovering possible QoS advantages enjoyed by cloud providers with and without private WANs from an end-user's perspective. Our study extends their efforts by making a wider endpoint selection that includes datacenters from nine different cloud providers, both with and without private WAN deployment (see §6).

### Measurement Methodology

#### End-Points Selection

Our analysis aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of cloud reachability and the factors affecting it globally. Therefore, our provider selection was influenced by factors such as geographical presence and private WAN deployment. We chose 195 cloud regions operated by nine different cloud providers as end-points: Amazon, Google, Microsoft Azure, IBM, Oracle, Alibaba, DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr. Table 1 shows the distribution of our endpoints across continents, and Figure 1a illustrates their deployment density globally. For each provider, we filtered cloud regions that support compute services (e.g., Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine) and retrieved the hostname of a public VM hosted in that region using CloudHarmony [20]. Some providers, such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have built massive private WANs to shield tenant traffic from the public Internet [76]. Table 1 also indicates whether a cloud provider has a fully-private (Private), semi-private (Semi), or public Internet-based (Public) network backbone. We included datacenters operated by Alibaba Cloud due to their significant presence in Asia, especially in China [3].

#### Vantage Points Selection

**Speedchecker Vantage Points:** The primary source of data collection in this study comes from experiments over vantage points (VPs) from the Speedchecker platform [52]. Speedchecker is a global measurement platform that hosts several hundred thousand softwareized probes in over 170 countries, almost all deployed exclusively in user devices, closely reflecting true end-user experience. The platform allows researchers to use an API to trigger and record active network measurements (traceroute, ping, HTTP GET, etc.) [51]. Probes on Speedchecker are divided into three broad categories based on their operating platform: router, PC, and Android. For our experiments, we utilized only Android probes for two reasons. First, throughout our measurement campaign, Android VPs had the largest share of the total probes on the platform (≈ 89%)—around 470,000 probes deployed globally, with at least 29,000 available at any given time. Second, we verified with the Speedchecker management team that the majority of Android probes are deployed in real user mobile phones, relying on wireless last-mile (WiFi/cellular) to connect to the Internet. Throughout our measurement period, we used upwards of 115,000 Speedchecker probes distributed in over 140 countries worldwide, as shown in Figure 1b (refer to Appendix A.1 for the deployment density-based distribution of VPs used in this study).

**RIPE Atlas Dataset:** We correlated and compared our active measurements over Speedchecker with a cloud reachability study conducted by Corneo et al. [22] using the RIPE Atlas platform [66]. RIPE Atlas is a global Internet measurement platform driven by network enthusiasts, including thousands of small hardware and software probes deployed across the globe. The dataset includes ICMP pings and TCP traceroutes collected from over 8,500 Atlas probes to the same set of cloud regions shown in Table 1. Corneo et al. conducted the study between September 2019 and September 2020, and the 60GB+ dataset includes ≈ 4M unique probe-to-cloud paths and ≈ 2.3M ping data points. The dataset is publicly available at [30].

The coverage of Speedchecker VPs is significantly higher than that of RIPE Atlas. Throughout our measurement study, we found that the number of connected Speedchecker probes consistently surpassed those of RIPE Atlas. For example, while RIPE Atlas offers ≈ 9K+ active probes, Speedchecker allows researchers to utilize ≈ 29K+ probes at any given time out of its 115K total available probes. More importantly, the geographical deployment density and availability of Speedchecker are much more comprehensive. The geographic distribution of Speedchecker and RIPE Atlas probes used in our study is shown in Figures 1b and 2, respectively. While VPs from both platforms are highly concentrated in Europe and North America, Speedchecker’s probe density per geographical distance (geoDensity) is almost 12× in EU and 6× in NA compared to Atlas. Additionally, unlike Atlas, Speedchecker has at least 200 VPs in almost all countries within these two continents. Germany, Great Britain, Iran, and Japan have the densest VP coverage in Speedchecker, boasting over 5,000 available probes. The platform’s coverage advantage is especially evident in developing regions, such as South America, Africa, and Asia, where probe geoDensity is 30-40× higher than RIPE Atlas. However, despite significant availability, VP coverage of both platforms within these regions is relatively sparse, with most probes concentrated in only a few countries.
