User: How do I set permanent paths for both Python 2 and 3 in command prompt such that I can invoke either every time I open the command window ie 'python2' for python 2 interpreter or 'python3' for python 3 interpreter
Assistant: Create a python2.bat and a python3.bat file somewhere on your path (could in your main python folder). That file only contains the location of the relavant python.exe, e.g.
C:\Programs\Python26\python.exe %*
