Table 4: Content policies [5, 13] we tested in our experiments against the skill certification process of VA platforms. ùê¥ and ùê∫ in-
dicates that a policy is defined by Amazon Alexa platform and Google Assistant, respectively. "Kids/General category" reflects
the number of skills/actions we submitted in the Kids or General category. "Certified" denotes the number of skills/actions
finally being certified, and "Failed" means the number of skills/actions that were never certified even after resubmissions. In
this table, we submitted 234 skills (119 kids skills and 112 general skills) in total and got them certified. We submitted 273
policy-violating actions in total out of which 116 actions were certified and 157 failed to pass the certification. The red colour
denotes a policy with high-risk, orange for intermediate-risk and green for policies with low-risk. The elements in the table
that are left blank denotes that no skills/actions were submitted in that category for the specific policy.

Table 5: Privacy requirements [6] defined by VA platforms. Note that Amazon Alexa‚Äôs privacy requirements and content policy
guidelines have overlaps about collecting personally identifiable information. Privacy requirements 4, 5, and 6 are not covered
in Table 4. Therefore, we submitted 3 additional policy-violating skills in these categories and got them certified. The rest of
the skills/actions are violating policy guidelines listed in Table 4 and is therefore not a different skill. The red colour denotes
a policy with high-risk, and orange for intermediate-risk.
