5. CLICK-POINT CLUSTERING
During PCCP password creation, users pressed the shuf-
ﬂe button when they were unable or unwilling to select a
click-point within the currently highlighted viewport. We
expect fewer shuﬄes to lead to more randomly distributed
passwords, and hence greater security. In this study, there
was large variability in the number of shuﬄes but no clear
pattern emerged. The median number of shuﬄes per pass-
word for all conditions is less than ﬁve, indicating that most
participants pressed the shuﬄe button less than once per
image (passwords consisted of between 5 and 7 images).
Passwords should be as random as possible while still
maintaining memorability. Clustering of click-points on an
image across users creates what are known as hotspots. At-
tackers who can determine likely hotspots (through image
analysis or by gathering a sample of passwords from even a
small number of people [30]) would be better positioned to
launch an eﬀective dictionary guessing attack. Ideally, a sys-
tem would minimize the occurrence of hotspots. PCCP at-
tempts to accomplish this through the randomly-positioned
viewport, however, users may shuﬄe the viewport to ﬁnd a
memorable location. We explored whether either image size
or number of click-points had an eﬀect on user choice.
To analyze the randomness and clustering of our two-
dimensional spatial data, we turned to point pattern analy-
sis [14] commonly used in biology and earth sciences. Our
analysis used spatstat [2], a spatial statistics package for the
R programming language.
We used the J-statistic [28] as a measure of click-point
clustering on a subset of images for which we had suﬃcient
data. Our system ensured that 30 of the images were shown
to every participant, giving enough data points for anal-
ysis on these particular images. To measure the cluster-
ing of points in a dataset, the J-statistic combines nearest-
neighbour calculations and empty-space measures for a given
radius r. When J(r) = 0, it indicates that all points cluster
at the same location. When J(r) = 1, the points are ran-
domly dispersed across the space. Finally, when J(r) > 1,
the points are uniformly distributed. For passwords, we
want results closer to J(r) = 1 since this would be least
predictable by attackers. We examined clustering at J(9).
A radius of 9 approximates the size of the 19 × 19 tolerance
squares used by our system during password re-entry.
Figure 5 shows the level of clustering for the 30 images,
with image names on the x-axis. This ﬁgure illustrates the
eﬀects of the number of click-points on clustering. Points
on each line contain statistics for passwords created using
either 5, 6, or 7 click-points. The J-statistic for each image
is distinct; the connecting lines are only included for read-
ability. As with earlier analysis in this paper, data from the
small (451 × 331) and large (800 × 600) images are grouped
together based on the number of click-points per password.
