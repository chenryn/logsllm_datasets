# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
It would be more useful if already running programs are shown first in the
results list in the quick launcher (like the old WindowWalker). **_Or maybe an
option to change the priority._**
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
In the results list, the running programs should be first in the list.
