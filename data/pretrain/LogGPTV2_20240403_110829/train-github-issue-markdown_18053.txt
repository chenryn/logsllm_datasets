### Version
2.6.13
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/quizzical-wildflower-mp7tm
### Steps to reproduce
  1. create a component with scoped slot
  2. put at least 2 children inside this scoped slot
  3. make the first child conditionally rendered with V-IF directive
The V-IF directive in the first child will control the rendering of all the
other siblings inside the scoped slot. This only happens if the first child
inside the scoped slot uses V-IF - or if it is an HTML comment.
### What is expected?
The V-IF should only affect the tag/component it is applied to - but not the
siblings.
### What is actually happening?
If the first child in any scoped slot is an HTML comment (and V-IF with a
falsy argument actually renders HTML comment) - all the rest children in the
scoped slot are not rendered.

The function "normalizeScopedSlot" in vue.runtime.esm.js for v2.6.13 is
slightly different (and buggy) than v2.6.12.  
In 2.6.12 the rendering is skipped if there is only 1 child in the scoped slot
and this child is a comment.  
However, in 2.6.13 there is no check for the number of children and the
rendering of all children is skipped if the first child is both (a) comment
and (b) not an async factory.
