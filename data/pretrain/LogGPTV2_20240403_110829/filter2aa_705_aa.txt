Myth #1
 Kids have become more violent since videogames 
have become commonplace in the home.
Reality
 Youth crime remains at, or near, a 30‐year low.
http://www.about.chapinhall.org/press/newsalerts/2006/CrimeRate06.html
Myth #2
 Playing violent videogames makes you more 
aggressive.
Reality
No research has found that video games are a primary  
factor or that violent video game play could turn an  
otherwise normal person into a killer.
http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/myths.html
Myth #3
 The main market for videogames is children.
Reality
 The average age of most frequent game buyers is 40 
years old. In 2006, 93 percent of computer game 
buyers and 83 percent of console game buyers were 
over the age of 18.

Myth #4
 Girls just don’t like videogames.
Reality
 Thirty‐eight percent of gamers are women and 
women aged 18 or older represent a significantly 
greater  portion of the game playing population 
(30%) than boys aged 17 or under (23%).
http://www.theesa.com/facts/gamer_data.php
Myth #5
 The military uses video games to train soldiers to kill, 
therefore video games do the same thing to children.
Reality
 Research points to a fundamentally different model 
of how and what players learn from games.
http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/myths.html
Myth #6
 Playing video games makes you a loner.
Reality
 Studies in the US show that 60% of frequent gamers 
play with friends.
http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/22/1074732535783.html
Myth #7
 Playing video games makes you less sensitive to 
violence.
Reality
 There has been no evidence to suggest that games 
have a more desensitizing effect than other forms of 
media.

History of Peripherals
 1980s – early 90s 
 Video game peripherals were innovative!
 Unique designs allowed for new styles of gameplay
 Focused on different skill‐sets and each required mastery
 Mid 90s – early 21st century
 As industry began to grow new technology dwindled
 Redesign of input meant greater risk
 Publishers wanted devices that were “market safe” and 
focused on profit above all else
History of Peripherals
 2004 ‐ present
 New rise in innovative input devices
 Inspired by gamers who have gotten tired of the traditional 
gaming model
 Devices take advantage of the body and motion
 Ex. Nintendo Wii Remote, Donkey Kong Bongo drums, 
Samba De Amigo marracas, EyeToy camera, Sony Sixaxis 
controller, dance pads
 Resurgence in older technology
 Ex. Lightguns, microphones, touch‐screens
History of Peripherals
 1972
 Atari Inc. launches PONG to unsuspecting masses
 Popularizes so‐called “Paddle” controllers
 Device usually consisted 
of a potentiometer and 
a few buttons
 Very first analog input 
device, paving the way 
for many more to come
History of Peripherals
 1977
 Atari Inc. releases the Atari VCS (Video Computer 
System)
 Brought the arcade joystick to home consumers
 First major home video game console to make use of joysticks 
 Bundled controllers were 
4‐directional digital one‐button
joysticks
History of Peripherals
 1977 (cont'd.)
 Many knockoffs of the Atari joystick were produced, 
compatible with the system
 One, had foot operated switches
 QJ Footpedal System had three foot‐operated switches and a

History of Peripherals
 1983
 Nintendo Corporation unveils the Nintendo Family 
Computer
 Introduces first peripheral to include active components in 
the joypad, as well as the eponymous “d‐pad”
 Joypads used an 8‐bit CMOS shift register to tell the console 
what button was being pressed without requiring a direct 
wire for each button
History of Peripherals
 1984‐1989
 Nintendo Corporation launches more peripherals...
 Nintendo Zapper allowed gamers to “fire” at their games, 
realistically
 Nintendo Satellite allowed gamers to use their controllers 
wirelessly in the same room
 The Robot Operating Buddy (R.O.B.) made use of optical 
flashes from the TV and had arms that could move left, right, 
up and down along with hands that pinched together; worked 
with two games: Gyromite and Stack‐Up
 The NES Advantage offered home gamers the power of the 
arcade controller, along with variable‐speed turbo and a type 
of slow motion
History of Peripherals
 1984‐1989 (cont'd)
 Nintendo Corporation launches more peripherals...
 The Power Pad was the first floor mat peripheral, containing 
12 pressure sensitive sensors (originally developed for World 
Class Track Meet, but a few other games made use of it as 
well)
