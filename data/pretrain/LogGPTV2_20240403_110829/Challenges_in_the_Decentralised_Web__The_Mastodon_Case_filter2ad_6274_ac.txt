### Exploration of Mastodon's Downtime and Dependencies

**Downtime Analysis:**
Figure 8 further explores the daily downtime of Mastodon instances, categorized by the number of toots. The box plot reveals that smaller instances (with fewer than 10,000 toots) experience the highest median downtime (12%). Surprisingly, instances with over 1 million toots have worse availability (2.1% median downtime) compared to those with between 100,000 and 1 million toots (0.34% median downtime). The correlation between the number of toots and downtime is -0.04, indicating that instance popularity is not a reliable predictor of availability. For comparison, Twitter's average downtime in 2007 was 1.25%, while Mastodon instances averaged 10.95%.

**Federated Subscription Links:**
Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of federated subscription links between countries. The top five countries attract 93.66% of all federated links, with Japan, the US, and France hosting 89.1% of all toots. This concentration may undermine the decentralized web's (DW) initial goals, as large volumes of data are concentrated in a few jurisdictions.

**Autonomous System (AS) Distribution:**
The distribution of Mastodon instances across ASes is examined in Figure 5. With 351 ASes hosting Mastodon servers, each AS averages 10 instances, suggesting a well-distributed system. However, the top three ASes account for 62% of all global users, with Amazon hosting over 30% of users despite only serving 6% of instances. Cloudflare also plays a significant role, with 31.7% of toots across 5.4% of instances. This centralization, while robust, poses risks if a few ASes fail or change policies.

**Certificate Dependencies:**
Figure 9(a) shows that Let’s Encrypt is the chosen CA for over 85% of instances, likely due to its free and automated services. However, certificate expirations are a notable issue, with 105 instances going down on July 23, 2018, due to simultaneous Let’s Encrypt certificate expirations. Certificate expirations account for 6.3% of observed outages.

**AS Outages:**
Table 1 summarizes AS failures, where AS9370 (Sakura) experienced the largest outage, losing 97 instances and rendering 3.89 million toots unavailable. AS12322 (Free SAS) had the most outages (15), affecting 9 instances. These AS outages, though rare, have a significant impact, temporarily removing 4.98 million toots and 41.5K user accounts from the system.

**Outage Durations:**
Figure 10 presents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of continuous outages. Almost all instances (98%) experience at least one downtime, with a quarter being unavailable for at least one day. In the worst case, 6% of all toots were unavailable for an entire day on April 15, 2017.

### Federation and Resilience

**Federation Overview:**
Federation allows users to create global follower links across instances. Figure 11 shows the degree distribution of the social and federation graphs, revealing a power-law distribution. Highly connected nodes, such as popular instances, can cause significant disruptions if they fail.

**Impact of Removing Users:**
Removing highly connected users from the social graph (G(V, E)) significantly affects the Largest Connected Component (LCC). Removing just the top 1% of accounts decreases the LCC to 26.38% of all users. In comparison, Twitter's LCC remained at 80% even after removing the top 10% of users. This highlights Mastodon's greater sensitivity to user removals, which is exacerbated by the lack of a central provider and frequent instance outages.

**Conclusion:**
While Mastodon demonstrates a distributed architecture, it faces challenges related to central dependencies, certificate expirations, and AS outages. The resilience of the federation graph is also a concern, as the removal of key nodes can significantly fragment the network. Addressing these issues will be crucial for enhancing the stability and reliability of the decentralized web.
