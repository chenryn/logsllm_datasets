User:  What measures are usually taken to ensure high availability of application services?
Assistant: In order to ensure high availability of application services, the following measures are usually taken: 1. Clustering: By deploying applications on multiple servers to form application clusters, the availability of applications is improved. 2. Load balancing: By distributing requests to multiple servers, avoiding the overload of a single server, thereby improving the availability of the application. 3. Failover: When a server fails, requests can be transferred to other available servers to avoid interruption of application services. 4. Backup and recovery: Regularly back up applications and data so that application services can be quickly restored in the event of a failure. 5. Monitoring and alarming: Through real-time monitoring of application and server status, faults can be found in time and alarms can be taken in order to take measures quickly. 6. Hardware redundancy: Use redundant equipment on key network equipment to improve network availability, such as dual-system hot standby. 7. Containerization: Use container technology to isolate application services from the operating environment, making it more portable, replicable and scalable, thereby improving the availability of applications.
