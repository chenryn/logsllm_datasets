# Environment
    Windows Build Number: 10.0.18362.0
    WIndows Terminal version: 0.6.2951.0
    3 Monitor Setup
    - Main Screen High-DPI (Scaling 150%, 3840x2160)
    - Left and right: Scaling 100%, 1920x1200
# Steps to reproduce
  * Start Terminal
  * Terminal window opens on Main Screen (High DPI, Scaling 150%)
  * Move Window on secondary screen (Scaling 100%)
# Expected behavior
  * (Window scales down correctly)
  * Window should stay on second monitor
# Actual behavior
  * (Window scales down correctly)
  * Terminal window disappears after around 1 second without message
  * (Process is terminated according to Task Manager/Process Explorer)
# Additional information
If I set both screens to the same scaling (either 100% or 150%) the error does
not occur.
If I set the _secondary_ screen to 150% and the main screen to 100%, I can
move the Window from the (low-scale) main screen to the (150% scaled)
secondary screen without problem. When I move the window back to the
100%-Screen, it disappears again.
