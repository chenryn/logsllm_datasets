both included in Gartner’s market overview [20]. The organi-
zation which provided us with the access chose these vendors
because they are among the market leaders and were deemed
to have the most relevant TI. It did not conduct any analysis
of the overlap in indicators among the two vendors before we
started our research.
The offerings of the vendors consisted of 5-10 subsets
around speciﬁc topic areas, e.g., ‘ﬁnancial industry’, ‘cyberes-
pionage’ or ‘cybercrime’. Customers typically subscribe to
the subsets most relevant for them, rather than to all. As
explained in Section 3, we cannot identify the vendors, nor
can we list the exact topic areas the customer organization
subscribed to. We can only say that we had access to 3-5
subsets for each of the vendors and that these subsets focus
on the same topic areas. The selection of these topic areas
likely inﬂuences how the indicators are distributed over target
industries, as visualized in Figure 4. The degree of indicator
overlap between vendors might also vary across focus areas.

Table 1: Data sources for this mixed-methods study.
We assessed only the indicators that were packaged with
the TI reports that the vendors release. These reports analyze
the developments in the threat landscape and actor groups.
One vendor also had a bulk feed of indicators that were not
associated with reports. We did not include this in our com-
parison, because the other vendor provided no such feed.
We assessed the overlap between the paid TI sources as fol-
lows. Vendors label their intelligence products with metadata,
referring to a speciﬁc threat actor for 35% of their reports
and 60% of all indicators. Vendors use their own naming
schemes for threat actors. The same actor may thus appear
as Deep Panda, APT19, or KungFu Kittens across different
vendor reports. We mapped the names used by the vendors to
a common set of threat actors using an overview maintained
by well-known security researcher Florian Roth [32]. About
30% of all indicators could be mapped to a common threat
actor listed in the overview. These indicators form the basis
for the analysis of the overlap visualized in Figure 3. In sum,
we measure overlap speciﬁcally where the vendors claim that
they are tracking the same actor groups. The results are re-
ported in Section 5.1. In Section 6.2, we also report on the
overall overlap across the feeds.
To map the distribution of indicators across targeted indus-
tries, we mapped 179 labels from both vendors to a common
set of 16 categories. These are listed in Figure 4.
To represent OTI, we collected four freely available
sources. Three indicator feeds, for the high degree to which
they were reused by other open sources [15] – which we
expected might lead to reuse in paid TI– and one community-
based aggregator that enables its users to extract indicators
from blogs and reports, which vice versa we expected might
lead to reuse of PTI indicators in OTI. This way, we selected
for an upper bound of overlap between the two types. We
compare one month of data from these collected OTI feeds
(October 2018) against ﬁve months months of indicators from
the two PTI vendors (July to December 2018), in order to
compensate for the higher churn in the OTI feeds and, again,
to ﬁnd an upper bound in overlap. The preparation of the
OTI data consisted of deleting all duplicate IPs except for the
ﬁrst occurrences, then removing all IPs present on the ﬁrst
measurement day of each set, as it was unsure when those
were ﬁrst received. To remove inconsistencies from the threat
intelligence, we normalized them as follows. For URLs and
domains, we removed http(s)://, but kept preﬁxes that are
part of the domain – including the www domain which may
point to another location. For ﬁle hashes in indicators, we
compared only MD5 hashes for each ﬁle to prevent dupli-
cate results. For IPs, no normalization was necessary, as the
format was consistent between sources. For the reports, we
removed all punctuation and casing from labels.
When matching indicators, we had to assume a time-to-live
period during which indicators could be reasonably assumed
to remain valid. Prior work chose periods of 30 days [21]
or does not make such assumptions explicit. Since overlap
among sources is an important indicator of coverage, we
proceeded conservatively and chose a time-to-live period of
360 days. This again to provide us with an upper bound, i.e.
over- rather than under-estimating the amount of overlap.
Interviews
4.2
As the ﬁeld of PTI is marked by ambiguous terms and com-
plex practices, we opted for a data collection method that
can help us unpack the ambiguity, namely semi-structured
interviews in a grounded-theory approach – similar to [41].
Grounded theory means that the researchers draw conclusions
through a reﬂexive process of inductive reasoning [10, 9].
This approach means that our ﬁndings can help form an un-
derstanding about how the market for PTI functions, but not
about how the reported views are distributed across the global
population of security professionals who use PTI.
Between August and December of 2019, we conducted 14
interviews with professionals who work with PTI. Partic-
ipants were selected from different sectors in business and
government (Table 2). A requirement was that their orga-
nization purchased commercial threat intelligence. We con-
tacted participants via their personal networks, as well as via
LinkedIn. Geographically, the participants were located in
The Netherlands (11) and Japan (3). They fulﬁlled positions
from analyst to management in both security operations and
threat intelligence teams. Two of the respondents worked at
Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) which use TI
to protect the networks of their clients. In the sample, the

Table 2: Interviewees by industry, all experienced with PTI.
Figure 1: We reached analytical saturation after 9 interviews,
as no more new codes were uncovered.
ﬁnancial industry supplies the most interviewees. While this
might simply be an artefact of our recruitment effort, it is
consistent with the fact that ﬁnancial sector ﬁrms have the
highest investment levels in cybersecurity [40] and are thus
more likely to acquire expensive PTI subscriptions. One of
our respondents, a teamlead TI at an MSSP, remarked: “I
would say that the ﬁnancial industry is one of the most mature
sectors and can do more with threat intel.”
The interviews we conducted with security professionals
were semi-structured, meaning that respondents’ views were
central and conversations were open-ended [16]. The re-
searchers did not ask loaded questions to avoid steering the
conversation [5, 9]. A simple interview protocol was used in
which participants were asked about: (i) Their deﬁnition of
threat intelligence; (ii) What commercial sources their orga-
nization pays for and, for each of the sources, discuss costs,
source properties, use-cases, and valuable organizational out-
comes; (iii) Their experiences with use of non-commercial
sources; (iv) Their reasons for having discontinued a source,
if ever. The full interview protocol is included in Appendix A.
This approach was chosen deliberately to minimize the
inﬂuence of pre-conceived ideas about what TI is and how
it should be evaluated. Due to the nature of open questions
it also means that participants’ answers cannot be seen as
an exhaustive description of their opinion. Rather, outcomes
of the interviews are the perceptions that participants have
prioritized, that were ‘top of mind’ for them at the time.
We transcribed the interviews and coded them using the
ATLAS.ti software. Analytic codes were drawn from the in-
terviews and used as labels to identify recurring answers. The
codebook was iteratively saturated over the course of 9 inter-
views [9]; it reached the point where no new codes could be
observed from the interviews (see Figure 1). One researcher
carried out initial coding. We developed the codebook through
meetings with co-authors and two other researchers, each time
independently coding and then reﬁning codes as needed. Ac-
cording to [23], this is a suitable way to ensure reliability
of ﬁndings for our purposes. This eventually led to analytic
codes for TI service types, sources, use cases, and value per-
ceptions. The codebook is reﬂected in Tables 3 and 4, and is
included in Appendix B.

5 DESCRIPTION OF PAID TI
We now address the ﬁrst sub-question: What do paid TI
services consist of? We coded the different answers to the in-
terview question of what TI meant to the respondents. While
prior work has focused on the indicator feeds, respondents
also mentioned other PTI services, such as reports, requests
for information, portals and custom alerts. For some, these
services were more important than the indicators. We describe
these different forms of PTI. For the two main services, in-
dicators and reports, we also take a look at the offerings of
the two PTI vendors in our study. We end with a brief ex-
ploration of price levels in the commercial market for threat
intelligence.
5.1 TI services
Customers might subscribe to multiple TI services [31]. The
variety of services reﬂects different needs in the market. As
stated by a Team Lead TI at a bank: “Intelligence require-
ments differ per department. The SOC [Security Operations
Center] would like to see indicators of compromise and to
know TTPs [tactics, techniques and procedures], in order to
understand what criminals are targeting, while the Risk de-
partment wants to know if these criminals have the capability
and intent to disrupt our business, and if we are in control of
those risks.”

(a) IP indicators, avg. overlap 2,8%
Figure 2: An upward trend is visible in the indicators and
reports published by two leading paid TI providers between
2013-2019. Note that the Y-axis uses a log scale. Over
2018, a customer of one of the vendors might receive some
100 reports and 2500 indicators per month. The distribution
of indicators over reports (and thus over months) is highly
irregular.
Vendors of paid TI attach metadata to their intelligence
products. It describes what industry a report relates to, as well
as what threat actors the provider believes are involved. If
the provider attaches indicators to the report, they will place
in the metadata the degree of conﬁdence they have that the
indicator is malicious. This information is used to interpret
TI and determine how it can be used.
(cid:4) Indicators are signals of attacker presence on a net-
work. They are also referred to indicators of compromise
(IOCs). Examples are an IP address of known attacker in-
frastructure, the hash of a piece of malware or a domain
associated with a phishing campaign. Indicators are provided
in proprietary formats via an API, making them ingestable by
detection systems such as a SIEM or IDS. Indicators might
be used for network-based or host-based detection, but also
in different business processes, from security engineering to
various business decisions.
The two PTI vendors in our study attach indicators to
their reports. We ﬁnd that the volumes of new indicators
and reports of both vendors have steadily increased over the
course of ﬁve years (Figure 2). The publication of indicators is
