Both vendors are included in Gartner’s market overview [20]. The organization that provided us with access chose these vendors because they are among the market leaders and were deemed to have the most relevant threat intelligence (TI). No prior analysis was conducted on the overlap of indicators between the two vendors before our research began.

The offerings from these vendors consist of 5-10 subsets, each focusing on specific topic areas such as 'financial industry', 'cyberespionage', or 'cybercrime'. Customers typically subscribe to the subsets most relevant to their needs rather than the entire suite. As explained in Section 3, we cannot disclose the identities of the vendors or list the exact topic areas the customer organization subscribed to. However, we can confirm that we had access to 3-5 subsets for each vendor, all of which focused on the same topic areas. The selection of these topic areas likely influences the distribution of indicators across target industries, as visualized in Figure 4. The degree of indicator overlap between vendors may also vary across different focus areas.

**Data Sources for This Mixed-Methods Study**

| **Type** | **Source** | **Contents** | **Period** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PTI | Two leading providers | 7,308 reports; 420,173 indicators (IPs, domains, MD5) | 2013/01/01–2018/12/31 |
| OTI | Alienvault OTX (Community-aggregator) | 59,290 IPs | 2018/10/01–2018/10/31 |
| OTI | Blocklist.de | 121,540 IPs | 2018/10/01–2018/10/31 |
| OTI | CINSscore | 55,906 IPs | 2018/10/01–2018/10/31 |
| OTI | Emergingthreats | 876 IPs | 2018/10/01–2018/10/31 |
| Qualitative | 14 interviews | N/A | 2019/08/27–2019/12/23 |

We evaluated only the indicators packaged with the TI reports released by the vendors. These reports analyze developments in the threat landscape and actor groups. One vendor also provided a bulk feed of indicators not associated with reports, which we did not include in our comparison due to the lack of a similar feed from the other vendor.

To assess the overlap between the paid TI sources, we used metadata labels, which refer to specific threat actors for 35% of the reports and 60% of the indicators. Vendors use their own naming schemes for threat actors, so the same actor might be referred to as Deep Panda, APT19, or KungFu Kittens across different reports. We mapped these names to a common set of threat actors using an overview maintained by security researcher Florian Roth [32]. Approximately 30% of the indicators could be mapped to a common threat actor listed in the overview, forming the basis for the overlap analysis visualized in Figure 3. In summary, we measured overlap specifically where the vendors claim to be tracking the same actor groups. The results are reported in Section 5.1, and the overall overlap across the feeds is discussed in Section 6.2.

To map the distribution of indicators across targeted industries, we mapped 179 labels from both vendors to a common set of 16 categories, as listed in Figure 4.

For open-source threat intelligence (OTI), we collected four freely available sources: three indicator feeds known for their high reuse by other open sources [15], and one community-based aggregator that enables users to extract indicators from blogs and reports. This selection aimed to establish an upper bound for overlap between the two types. We compared one month of data from these OTI feeds (October 2018) against five months of indicators from the two PTI vendors (July to December 2018) to account for the higher churn in OTI feeds and to find an upper bound for overlap. The preparation of the OTI data involved removing duplicate IPs, except for the first occurrences, and excluding IPs present on the first measurement day of each set. To ensure consistency, we normalized URLs and domains by removing http(s)://, retaining domain prefixes, and comparing only MD5 hashes for file indicators.

When matching indicators, we assumed a time-to-live period of 360 days, chosen conservatively to provide an upper bound and avoid underestimating the overlap.

**Interviews**

Given the ambiguity and complexity in the field of paid threat intelligence (PTI), we used semi-structured interviews in a grounded-theory approach, similar to [41]. Grounded theory involves drawing conclusions through reflexive, inductive reasoning [10, 9]. This method helps us understand how the PTI market functions but does not provide insights into the distribution of views across the global population of security professionals who use PTI.

Between August and December 2019, we conducted 14 interviews with PTI professionals from various sectors, including finance, R&D, government, managed security service providers (MSSPs), and critical infrastructures (Table 2). Participants were selected based on their organizations' purchase of commercial threat intelligence, and we contacted them via personal networks and LinkedIn. Geographically, the participants were located in the Netherlands (11) and Japan (3), holding positions from analysts to management in both security operations and threat intelligence teams. Two respondents worked at MSSPs, which use TI to protect client networks. The financial sector provided the most interviewees, consistent with its high investment in cybersecurity [40].

The interviews were semi-structured, allowing for open-ended conversations [16] and avoiding loaded questions [5, 9]. The protocol covered definitions of threat intelligence, commercial sources, costs, source properties, use cases, and organizational outcomes. The full interview protocol is included in Appendix A.

We transcribed and coded the interviews using ATLAS.ti software, iteratively refining the codebook until no new codes emerged after nine interviews (Figure 1). One researcher initially coded the interviews, and the codebook was developed through meetings with co-authors and two other researchers, ensuring reliability [23]. The final codebook, reflected in Tables 3 and 4, is included in Appendix B.

**Description of Paid TI**

We address the first sub-question: What do paid TI services consist of? Respondents mentioned various PTI services, including reports, requests for information, portals, and custom alerts. Some found these services more important than the indicators. We describe these different forms of PTI, focusing on indicators and reports, and briefly explore price levels in the commercial market for threat intelligence.

**TI Services**

Customers may subscribe to multiple TI services [31], reflecting diverse market needs. As a Team Lead TI at a bank stated, "Intelligence requirements differ per department. The SOC [Security Operations Center] wants indicators of compromise and TTPs [tactics, techniques, and procedures] to understand criminal targets, while the Risk department focuses on the capability and intent of criminals to disrupt business and manage those risks."

**Intelligence Products**

| **Intelligence Products** | **Respondents (n=14)** |
| --- | --- |
| Indicators | 71% |
| Reports | 71% |
| Requests for information | 57% |
| Portal | 50% |
| Data mining and aggregation | 29% |
| Custom alerts | 14% |

**Indicators and Reports**

Vendors of paid TI attach metadata to their products, describing the related industry and threat actors. If indicators are attached, the metadata includes the provider's confidence level in the maliciousness of the indicator. This information aids in interpreting TI and determining its use.

**Indicators** are signals of attacker presence, also known as indicators of compromise (IOCs). Examples include IP addresses of known attacker infrastructure, malware hashes, and phishing campaign domains. Indicators are provided in proprietary formats via APIs, making them ingestible by detection systems like SIEM or IDS. They are used for network-based or host-based detection and in various business processes.

**Reports** analyze the threat landscape and actor groups. Both PTI vendors in our study attach indicators to their reports, and we observed a steady increase in the volume of new indicators and reports over five years (Figure 2).

**Overlap Analysis**

Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c show the overlap of indicators for threat actors tracked by both vendors from 2013-2018. The overlap is minimal and concentrated on a few actors.
