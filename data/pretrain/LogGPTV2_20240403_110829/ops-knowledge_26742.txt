User: I am interested in learning python but my Linux skills suck. I would like to develop a medium to large scale web application using python and django but afraid the software may not work well on a windows box. Is there a performance difference in running python on Linux vs Windows? Is there anything that I should watch out for when developing the application. Also, I am aware that it is very easy integrating C++ libraries with python. Is this statement still true is the code is on a windows box?
Assistant: Which software are you affraid will not work on windows, the actual web app or your development enviroment. If you mean the IDE, then I wouldn't worry about that there are very good python IDEs for windows, as for the webapp that's another discussion all together
The statement that "it is very easy integrating C++ libs with python" is not accurate, there are many ways of doing it and they are not all easy, I have personally only tried SWIG, but there are many other alternatives (for example Boost.Python), whoever I wouldn't believe it is as easy to get up and running with some of these tools on a windows enviromeny with out something like mingw or cygwin as at least SWIG is built with *nix in mind
