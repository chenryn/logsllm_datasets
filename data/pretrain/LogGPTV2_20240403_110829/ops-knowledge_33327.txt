User: I'm running Windows and the shell/OS automatically runs Python based on the registry settings when you run a program on the command line. Will this break if I install a 2.x and 3.x version of Python on the same machine?
I want to play with Python 3 while still being able to run 2.x scripts on the same machine.
Assistant: You should make sure that the PATH environment variable doesn't contain both python.exe files ( add the one you're currently using to run scripts on a day to day basis ) , or do as Kniht suggested with the batch files .
Aside from that , I don't see why not .
P.S : I have 2.6 installed as my "primary" python and 3.0 as my "play" python . The 2.6 is included in the PATH . Everything works fine .
