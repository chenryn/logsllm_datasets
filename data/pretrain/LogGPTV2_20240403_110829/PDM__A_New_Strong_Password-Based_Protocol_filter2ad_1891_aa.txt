**Abstract:**
This paper introduces PDM (Password Derived Moduli), a novel approach to strong password-based protocols suitable for mutual authentication or downloading security information such as private keys. We discuss the differences in desirable properties between strong password mutual authentication and credentials download. Specifically, a protocol designed solely for credentials download can be simpler and more cost-effective, as certain features (e.g., server authentication) are unnecessary. While mutual authentication features can be added to a credentials download protocol, many existing mutual authentication protocols are less efficient for credentials download compared to PDM, EKE, and SPEKE. PDM is computationally more expensive at the client but more efficient at the server, which is crucial given the server's need to handle numerous clients. We also present an enhancement to PDM that avoids storing password-equivalents at the server, making it a more efficient variant of augmented EKE and SPEKE.

## 1. Introduction

This paper presents a new mechanism allowing users to connect to a network from a generic client machine using only a name and password, without any user-specific configuration information. Smart cards are the most secure solution, but until they become ubiquitous, password-based authentication remains necessary. Unfortunately, passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore, it is essential to design a protocol that prevents eavesdroppers or impersonators from obtaining information for dictionary attacks.

Several protocols address this problem, including:
- **EKE (Encrypted Key Exchange)**: Uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange encrypted with the user’s password.
- **SPEKE (Simple Password Exponential Key Exchange)**: Uses a function of the user’s password as the base in a Diffie-Hellman exchange.
- **Augmented EKE and SPEKE**: Enhancements to avoid storing password-equivalents at the server.
- **SRP (Secure Remote Password)**: Offers similar properties to augmented EKE and SPEKE with better performance.
- **AMP (Authenticated Multi-Party Protocol)**: Similar to SRP with comparable properties.
- **Other Protocols**: Include those based on linear polynomials over GF(2^n), RSA, and others, each with varying security proofs.

PDM (Password Derived Moduli) uses a safe prime \( p \) (where \( (p-1)/2 \) is also prime) deterministically generated from the user’s password, salted with additional information like the user’s name. PDM is computationally intensive for the client but highly efficient at the server, making it a potentially important approach. It requires interaction with only a single server, which is often more desirable than multi-server protocols.

## 2. Properties of Credentials Download vs. Mutual Authentication Schemes

### Desirable Properties for Both Schemes:
- **User Knowledge**: Alice needs only her name and password.
- **Workstation Configuration**: No user-specific security information required.
- **Eavesdropping Protection**: An eavesdropper cannot learn Alice’s password or gain information for offline attacks.
- **Impersonation Resistance**: Impersonators cannot gain information for offline attacks, though one can verify a single online guess.
- **Database Salting**: Bob’s database should be salted to prevent bulk dictionary attacks.

### Additional Properties for Mutual Authentication:
- **Server Authentication**: Alice must authenticate Bob.
- **Client Authentication**: Bob must authenticate Alice.
- **Replay Attack Prevention**: Prevents attackers from authenticating using replayed messages.
- **Database Security**: Stolen databases cannot be used directly to impersonate Alice.
- **Multi-Server Security**: Information stored by one server cannot be used to impersonate another.

Credentials download protocols can be simpler, stateless, and require fewer messages, making them more efficient. Once credentials are securely downloaded, the client can use any strong secret-based authentication protocol.

## 3. PDM: Password Derived Moduli

The key to PDM, like EKE and SPEKE, is to modify a Diffie-Hellman exchange using a function of the user’s password. In PDM, we calculate a prime \( p \) as a function of the user’s password, using it as a seed for a pseudo-random number generator. This approach ensures that the prime is unique and secure, making PDM a robust and efficient solution for both credentials download and mutual authentication.
