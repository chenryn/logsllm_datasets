### Problem description
It's a weird issue. The border of a TextField has the color black (see
Screenshot):

Checking the CSS in the developer console:

So obviously there is no color set on the border.
This happens in Chrome, but in Firefox it works. But it get even more weird:
When I build my app with the flag `NODE_ENV=production` then it DOES work
properly.
Also changing these two lines of code here:
https://github.com/callemall/material-
ui/blob/master/src/TextField/TextFieldUnderline.js#L94-L95
â€¦ to `borderBottom: 'solid 2px ' + focusColor,` work as well, even with a
normal build.
I wanted to create a Webpackbin example, but there it works fine.
I'm using Meteor, don't know if that matters. But maybe someone find a
solution.
