We installed k8s by using kubeadm a week ago without problem.  
Here is output form kubectl version:

Yesterday kicked off another installation and "kubeadm init" hang when"waiting
for the control plane to become ready".  
Here is the output from kubectl version:  
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"4", GitVersion:"v1.4.4",
GitCommit:"3b417cc4ccd1b8f38ff9ec96bb50a81ca0ea9d56", GitTreeState:"clean",

It seemed only difference is to have a higher version 1.4.4 now.
**What you expected to happen** :  
kubeadm init waiting less than 1 minute to resume the setup.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
following the step described on "Installing Kubernetes on Linux with kubeadm"  
http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
Do you have another way to describe how to install/setup kubenetes other than
kubeadm?
Thanks
