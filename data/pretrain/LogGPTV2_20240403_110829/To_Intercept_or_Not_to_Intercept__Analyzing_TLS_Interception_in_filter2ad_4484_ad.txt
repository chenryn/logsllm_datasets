### Certificate Handling and Validation in Network Appliances

**Connection Termination and Malformed Extension Values:**
- **pfSense, Microsoft TMG, and Cisco Ironport WSA** terminate the connection.
- **Untangle and Microsoft TMG** accept malformed extension values and display the web page.
- **pfSense and Cisco Ironport WSA** pass the anomalous certificate to the browser, which then blocks access.

**Certificate Revocation Status:**
- **Microsoft TMG and Cisco Ironport WSA** check the revocation status of offered certificates.
- **Untangle and pfSense** do not perform this check.

**Expired Leaf Certificates:**
- **Untangle, pfSense, and Microsoft TMG** block access when exposed to expired leaf certificates.
- **Cisco Ironport WSA** forwards the certificates to the browser, as its default settings are configured to only monitor but not drop connections for expired leaf certificates.

**Root CA Certificate Expiry and Validity:**
- **Untangle** fails to detect expired or not yet valid root CA certificates.
- **pfSense and Microsoft TMG** block access.
- **Cisco Ironport WSA** disallows adding such certificates to its trusted store.

**Key Usage and Key Encipherment:**
- **Untangle, pfSense, and Cisco Ironport WSA** terminate TLS connections if the keyUsage does not include keyEncipherment.
- **Microsoft TMG** allows such connections.

**KeyCertSign and extKeyUsage:**
- **Untangle** fails to detect root CA certificates without keyCertSign in their keyUsage values.
- **pfSense and Microsoft TMG** block access.
- **Cisco Ironport WSA** disallows adding such root CA certificates to its trusted store.
- **Cisco Ironport WSA** also disallows adding root CA certificates with extKeyUsage set to codeSigning, while **Untangle, pfSense, and Microsoft TMG** accept such certificates.

**Root CA RSA Key Sizes:**
- **Cisco Ironport WSA** does not allow adding RSA-512 root certificates to its store.
- **Untangle and pfSense** permit TLS connections involving such certificates.
- **Microsoft TMG** successfully terminates the connection.
- All tested appliances permit server certificates signed by RSA-1024 root CA certificates.

**Leaf Certificate Key Sizes:**
- All appliances terminate connections that use RSA-512.
- **Untangle, pfSense, and Cisco Ironport WSA** accept RSA-768, RSA-1016, and RSA-1024 certificates.
- **Microsoft TMG** blocks access to RSA-768 and RSA-1016 but allows RSA-1024 certificates.

**Signature Hashing Algorithms:**
- **Microsoft TMG** mirrors signature hashing algorithms, passing weak and deprecated hash algorithms to the client.
- **Untangle and pfSense** do not accept certificates signed using the MD4 algorithm.
- **Cisco Ironport WSA** continues connections with such certificates.
- **MD5 and SHA1** are accepted by **pfSense and Cisco Ironport WSA**, while **Untangle** accepts SHA1 and disallows MD5.

**Self-Signed Certificates:**
- **Untangle and Microsoft TMG** fail to notice anomalies in self-signed certificates.
- **pfSense and Cisco Ironport WSA** terminate the connection.

**TLS Connection Termination:**
- **Untangle and Microsoft TMG** use a TLS handshake failure.
- **pfSense** redirects the connection to an error page.
- **Cisco Ironport WSA** uses an untrusted CA certificate, relying on the browser to block it.

**Default TLS Inspection:**
- Only **UserGate Web Filter** enables inspection by default. This lack of certificate validation makes users behind a freshly installed UserGate appliance vulnerable to trivial MITM attacks.

### Trusted CA Stores and Private Keys

**Trusted CA Store Locations:**
- **Untangle**: `/usr/share/untangle/lib/ssl-inspector/trusted-ca-list.jks`
- **pfSense**: `/usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt`
- **Microsoft TMG**: Windows Trusted Store (Local Computer)
- **Cisco Ironport WSA**: Accessible through the Cisco Trusted Root Certificate List

**Private Key Protection:**
- **Untangle, pfSense, WebTitan Gateway, and UserGate** store plaintext private keys on their filesystems.
- **Microsoft TMG** stores the private key using Microsoftâ€™s Software Key Storage Provider, which is exportable with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Cisco Ironport WSA**'s private key could not be located on disk; it was extracted from memory using Heartleech.

### Practical Attacks

**MITM Vulnerabilities:**
- **UserGate (by default) and WebTitan Gateway (after enabling TLS interception)** are vulnerable to trivial MITM attacks due to a lack of certificate validation.
- **Untangle** is similarly vulnerable due to the inclusion of the RSA-512 'Root Agency' certificate, which can be compromised easily.
