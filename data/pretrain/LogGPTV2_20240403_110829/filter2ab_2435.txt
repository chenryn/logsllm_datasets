**ATT&CK ID:** M1035  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Limit Access to Resources Over the Network

To enhance network security and limit access to resources, implement the following measures:

1. **Network Access Control Policies:**
   - Utilize device certificates and adhere to the 802.1X standard to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to the network.
   
2. **Restrict DHCP Usage:**
   - Limit the use of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to registered devices only. This prevents unregistered or unauthorized devices from obtaining IP addresses and communicating with trusted systems.

By enforcing these policies, you can effectively control and secure access to network resources, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
