The linux/arm64 port has been broken since March 20. Now that I have access to
hardware, here is a minimal reproduction:
    package main
    func main() {    
            text := "abc"
            s := &s{text}
            println(text[2] == s.text[2])
    }
    type s struct {
            text string
    }
On linux/arm64 (tip `f8fd550`), bootstrapped with `11dba2e`, this prints
false.
