B RESULTS OF THE USER STUDY
B.1 Participants
Figure 6 gives an overview of the participation in our user study.
In total, the sign up button was pressed 65 times, for which we
identified 39 unique users. Of those 39 participants, 5 never suc-
ceeded in registering n-Auth and 2 more succeeded in registering
n-Auth but did not answer any questions. Of the 32 participants in
our user study, 24 logged in the second day to answer the next set
of questions. As the study progressed, more participants dropped
out. Having only 4 participants answering the last day’s questions
can be partially explained by:
(1) the cut-off day for being eligible to win the reward being on
day 6; and
(2) we only sent email reminders during the two weeks the
study took place, even though participants could fill in the
questions for one more week (for those that missed a day or
even a couple of days).
Figure 6: User participation.
Taking a closer look at the 24 participants that logged in the sec-
ond day. The users represented different age groups well (see Figure
7), with the youngest users being from the age group 18-24 and the
oldest user from the age group 65+. Roughly 2 out of 3 participants
used the Android n-Auth app, while the remaining 1/3 used the
iOS n-Auth app. During registration participants were assigned at
random to make use of the n-Auth authentication method with or
without the PIN database locking mechanism (see Section 3.4). For
40% of the participants, the PIN database locking mechanism was
enabled.

recognition, but none were using voice recognition for logging into
services. Figure 8 illustrates the current login methods used by our
participants.
Figure 7: Participants’ age distribution.
B.2 Getting started
As can be deduced from the number of failed initializations and
the drop-out rate of the users, the system proved to be somewhat
hard to use. As multiple registrations for the same email addresses
were observed from the server logs, some users were contacted
directly in order to determine whether they had problems accessing
the system. Using this method we were able to solve some issues
people had when trying to access the system.
Figure 8: Current authentication methods of participants
The participants’ login method preferences related to different
types of services were also a part of the questionnaire. Participants
were asked what kinds of login methods they thought are best for
banking services, social media and discussion forums, i.e., services
we think have three somewhat different levels of security needs.
Figure 9 illustrates the participants’ preferences regarding different
types of login methods for three different types of services.
Figure 9: Login preferences of participants for three types of
services
In addition to login methods related to different types of services,
the users were asked what kinds of login methods they were using
readily on a daily basis. According to the respondents, traditional
password was the preferred login method. More uncommon meth-
ods such as voice recognition and face recognition were not popular
among test users. Figure 10 presents the distribution of responses.
B.4 Findings on n-Auth
On the first day, a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 very diffi-
cult to 5 very easy) and a related open-ended question were used
to collect data about the ease of adoption and first impressions
regarding n-Auth. 32 participants responded to the Likert scale
question and the average value of the responses was 3.4 (neutral,
One issue we identified was the availability of the application
only in English. Although Finnish people are usually quite fluent
in English, having the application available in their own native
language might have helped some of the users. Some also expe-
rienced problems when installing the n-Auth app, some due to
security measures on their own (company issued) phones when
downloading new applications. Other participants were not that
experienced in installing new applications on their smart phones, a
set of instructions for installing and finding your new applications
on your phone could have also been helpful.
A key element that some participants were missing was a more
thorough set of instructions for use. For the purposes of this study,
a very compact check list of instructions for installing and using the
application was written on the Owela page associated with this trial.
The instructions weren’t clear enough in presenting the difference
between creating a new account and logging in when using an
existing one. Although a feedback page was provided in Owela, few
users reported their problems on the site. The instructions detailed
two different use cases: using the survey with a computer after
scanning the code with a mobile phone; and using the survey with
a mobile phone by clicking on the code. It would seem that these
instructions could have been clearer, as some users had trouble
figuring out what and when to do with their mobile phone.
Some users criticized the inadequate guidelines and visual look
and feel on the actual survey page. One of the main issues was that
on the registration page, there were no instructions available on the
actual use of the application. The registration form and the code
being visible simultaneously on the same page caused confusion,
and the only instructions available were about the structure of the
study.
B.3 Previous experience
Participants were asked what authentication methods they are
currently using. All of the 24 participants who responded were
used to using PIN codes. Login methods based on passwords (19
users), social media login, security codes on paper and fingerprint
were also commonly used among test users. One user used face

a PIN code and the participants using n-Auth without a PIN code.
The users who did not use the PIN code, found the use of n-Auth
to be easier.
Figure 10: Willingness of users to use different authentica-
tion methods on a daily basis
leaning towards easy). 8 participants (25%) considered the adoption
of n-Auth either very difficult or rather difficult and 19 participants
(60%) perceived the adoption as very easy or rather easy. Three
participants (10%) considered the adoption of the n-Auth method
as neither difficult nor easy. Many of the participants who consid-
ered the adoption process to be difficult, thought it was confusing.
Participants with more positive Likert scale responses described
the adoption of n-Auth as quick and simple.
Figure 11 illustrates the distribution of the participants’ responses
on a 5-point Likert scale. In addition to the perceptions of the par-
ticipants as a whole, the figure also presents the difference between
participants using n-Auth with and without a PIN code. The average
value of the Likert scale responses concerning the ease of adoption
was 3.3 among PIN code users and 3.6 among those users who did
not use a PIN code.
Figure 12: Perceived ease of use of n-Auth
Users were also asked to evaluate the ease of use through a
similar response option scale on the tenth and final day of the study.
The average value of responses on the final day was 3.6 - almost the
same value as on day 5. On the final day the amount of responses
was lower as only 4 participants persisted until the very end of the
study.
Participants were also asked to compare passwords and the n-
Auth method from three perspectives: security, convenience and
speed. The participants evaluated these aspects on a 5-point Lik-
ert scale (ranging from 1 being much less secure/much less con-
venient/much slower to 5 being much more secure/much more
convenient/much faster than passwords). Figure 13 presents the
average of the responses from all users combined, separately for
PIN code users and users without PIN code.
Figure 11: Perceived ease of adoption
In the fifth day of the user study participants were asked to
evaluate the ease of use with a 5-point Likert scale. 12 out of 20
(60%) respondents considered the use of n-Auth rather easy or very
easy. 6 respondents (30%) perceived the use rather or very difficult
and 2 users (10%) neither difficult nor easy. The average of score
for the responses was 3.7. Figure 12 presents the distribution of all
responses regarding the perceived ease of use of n-Auth from three
perspectives: all participants, the participants using n-Auth with
Figure 13: Comparing n-Auth to passwords
The users without a PIN code thought the n-Auth method was
slightly faster, more convenient and secure than a traditional pass-
word. Conversely, the users with PIN codes enabled felt the n-Auth
method was slower, less convenient and only as secure as a pass-
word.

B.5 Timings
Figure 14 shows the box plot of the times (24 participants) needed
to register n-Auth (the time from the website displaying the QR
code, that one needs to scan on the n-Auth device, to the actual reg-
istration of n-Auth at the server). Overall, it takes the participants
that needed to put in a PIN code only 50% longer. Given that it was
probably their first account protected with a PIN, they had to enter
a non-trivial PIN code and confirm it before being able to register.
One also has to account for users not having their smart phone at
hand or still having to install the n-Auth app.
Figure 14: Time required to register n-Auth.
Figure 15 shows the box plot of the average times each individual
participant (167 logins by 24 participants) needed to login using
n-Auth (the time from the website displaying the QR code, that one
needs to scan on the n-Auth device, to the actual login of n-Auth at
the server). For the participants individually, the time required to
login varies greatly, ranging from 5 to 7 seconds to up to 2 minutes.
This probably depends on the participants having their smart phone
at hand or not.
Figure 15: Time required to login using n-Auth.
B.6 Other findings
On day 7, the users were asked to estimate which services they
would be willing to use with n-Auth authentication. The answer
choices given were banking services, health services, governmental
services (such as taxes), email, online stores, social media, discussion
forums and news sites. Out of the 19 respondents on day 7, as many
as 15 were willing to use n-Auth when shopping online. Another
popular use possibility was email (12 respondents). Users were
less likely to want to use n-Auth with governmental services (8
respondents) or banking (9 respondents).
When commenting on their choices, some felt that they would
be ready to use the n-Auth method if they could opt to use the PIN
code with it to provide an extra layer of security. On the other hand,
the use of several different passwords and PIN codes puts a load
on people’s memory. As some users, who were given PIN codes to
use with n-Auth, commented in the beginning of the study, it’s "yet
another PIN code to remember". In case one authentication method
can substitute many others and be multi-functional, it could provide
users with a welcome relief from remembering a large selection
of different access codes. This is often the reason why people use
social media authentication, as it provides a quick and easy way to
log in and register to new services.
On day 8, users were asked whether they knew any services like
the n-Auth. Most users didn’t have experience on similar applica-
tions, although some mentioned mobile phone certificates, NFC
tags and one user provided a link to tiqr.
Unfortunately, the response choices for day 9 were confused
with another day, and the question and its multiple choice options
did not correspond with each other. Thus, the results from day 9
were not usable.
The main problems users had with the application were related
to feelings of confusion that could have been alleviated with a more
thorough set of instructions, and written separately for people using
the survey page on a mobile device and a computer. Especially the
registration process was difficult to understand, and logging in the
first time proved to be complicated. After the first hurdle, however,
the process became much clearer. Users wanted a clearer layout
and user interface and felt it seemed a bit unpolished.
Unfortunately there were some errors during the trial period,
and some users reported getting error messages. Despite this, most
users persisted and their answers were logged into the system. For
some who were using the system on a computer, it seemed a bit
cumbersome to dig out their phone, start the application, find the
link to the survey from their email, scan the code and fill in the
survey. Of course this was partly due to the structure of the study, as
the survey site was not a service they would have normally visited
and required a separate link.
B.7 Conclusion
Users were happy with how quick the method was to deploy. It
felt quite safe to most, especially if coupled with the additional PIN
code. If the method was accompanied with a set of comprehensive
instructions and a clear quick start guide, it might have a more
positive impact. On the positive side is also the fact that using a
method like this reduces the mental load for people, especially if
used without a PIN code. If using n-Auth would allow people to log
into several services without an extra set of credentials, it would
please many people who find passwords and PIN codes frustrating
and difficult to remember.
B.8 Lessons learnt
While we focused on simplicity, it is clear that we also need to
provide better instructions and documentation to the user (as is
also one of the design principles of Molich and Nielsen [16]).
