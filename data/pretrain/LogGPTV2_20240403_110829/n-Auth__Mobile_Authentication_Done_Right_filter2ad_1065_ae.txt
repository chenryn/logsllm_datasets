### Results of the User Study

#### B.1 Participants
Figure 6 provides an overview of the participation in our user study. In total, the sign-up button was pressed 65 times, resulting in 39 unique users. Of these, 5 never succeeded in registering n-Auth, and 2 more succeeded but did not answer any questions. This left us with 32 participants, of whom 24 logged in on the second day to answer the next set of questions. As the study progressed, more participants dropped out, with only 4 answering the last day’s questions. This can be partially explained by:
1. The cut-off day for being eligible to win the reward being on day 6.
2. We only sent email reminders during the two weeks the study took place, even though participants could fill in the questions for one more week.

**Figure 6: User Participation**

Of the 24 participants who logged in on the second day, the age distribution was well-represented across different groups (see Figure 7). Approximately 2 out of 3 participants used the Android n-Auth app, while the remaining 1/3 used the iOS n-Auth app. During registration, participants were randomly assigned to use the n-Auth authentication method with or without the PIN database locking mechanism. For 40% of the participants, the PIN database locking mechanism was enabled.

**Figure 7: Participants’ Age Distribution**

#### B.2 Getting Started
The system proved somewhat difficult to use, as indicated by the number of failed initializations and the drop-out rate. Multiple registrations for the same email addresses were observed from server logs, and some users were contacted directly to resolve issues. Using this method, we were able to solve some problems people had when trying to access the system.

**Figure 8: Current Authentication Methods of Participants**

Participants were also asked about their preferences for different types of services, such as banking services, social media, and discussion forums. Figure 9 illustrates the participants’ preferences regarding different types of login methods for three different types of services.

**Figure 9: Login Preferences of Participants for Three Types of Services**

In addition to service-specific login methods, users were asked about the methods they use daily. Traditional passwords were the most preferred, while less common methods like voice and face recognition were not popular among test users. Figure 10 presents the distribution of responses.

#### B.4 Findings on n-Auth
On the first day, a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 very difficult to 5 very easy) and a related open-ended question were used to collect data about the ease of adoption and first impressions of n-Auth. The average value of the responses was 3.4 (neutral, leaning towards easy). 8 participants (25%) considered the adoption of n-Auth either very difficult or rather difficult, while 19 participants (60%) perceived the adoption as very easy or rather easy. Three participants (10%) considered the adoption of the n-Auth method as neither difficult nor easy. Many participants who found the adoption process difficult thought it was confusing, while those with more positive responses described it as quick and simple.

**Figure 11: Perceived Ease of Adoption**

Users were also asked to evaluate the ease of use on the tenth and final day of the study. The average value of responses on the final day was 3.6, almost the same as on day 5. Only 4 participants persisted until the end of the study.

Participants were asked to compare passwords and n-Auth from three perspectives: security, convenience, and speed. Figure 13 presents the average of the responses from all users, separately for PIN code users and users without PIN codes.

**Figure 12: Perceived Ease of Use of n-Auth**

**Figure 13: Comparing n-Auth to Passwords**

Users without a PIN code thought the n-Auth method was slightly faster, more convenient, and secure than a traditional password. Conversely, users with PIN codes enabled felt the n-Auth method was slower, less convenient, and only as secure as a password.

#### B.5 Timings
Figure 14 shows the box plot of the times needed to register n-Auth (from the website displaying the QR code to the actual registration at the server). Overall, it took participants who needed to enter a PIN code 50% longer. Given that it was probably their first account protected with a PIN, they had to enter and confirm a non-trivial PIN code before registering.

**Figure 14: Time Required to Register n-Auth**

Figure 15 shows the box plot of the average times each individual participant (167 logins by 24 participants) needed to log in using n-Auth (from the website displaying the QR code to the actual login at the server). The time required to log in varied greatly, ranging from 5 to 7 seconds to up to 2 minutes, depending on whether the participants had their smart phones at hand or still had to install the n-Auth app.

**Figure 15: Time Required to Log in Using n-Auth**

#### B.6 Other Findings
On day 7, users were asked to estimate which services they would be willing to use with n-Auth authentication. Out of the 19 respondents, 15 were willing to use n-Auth for online shopping, and 12 for email. Users were less likely to want to use n-Auth with governmental services (8 respondents) or banking (9 respondents).

Some felt they would be ready to use n-Auth if they could opt to use a PIN code for extra security. However, the use of multiple passwords and PIN codes puts a load on people’s memory. Some users, who were given PIN codes to use with n-Auth, commented that it was "yet another PIN code to remember." A single, multi-functional authentication method could provide relief from remembering many access codes, which is often why people use social media authentication.

On day 8, users were asked if they knew any services like n-Auth. Most did not have experience with similar applications, although some mentioned mobile phone certificates, NFC tags, and one provided a link to tiqr.

Unfortunately, the response choices for day 9 were confused with another day, and the results were not usable.

The main problems users had with the application were related to confusion, which could have been alleviated with more thorough instructions, especially for those using the survey page on a mobile device and a computer. The registration process was particularly difficult to understand, and logging in for the first time was complicated. After the first hurdle, however, the process became much clearer. Users wanted a clearer layout and user interface and felt it seemed a bit unpolished.

There were some errors during the trial period, and some users reported getting error messages. Despite this, most users persisted, and their answers were logged into the system. For some using the system on a computer, it was cumbersome to dig out their phone, start the application, find the link to the survey from their email, scan the code, and fill in the survey. This was partly due to the structure of the study, as the survey site was not a service they would normally visit and required a separate link.

#### B.7 Conclusion
Users were happy with how quickly the method was to deploy. It felt quite safe to most, especially if coupled with the additional PIN code. If the method was accompanied by a set of comprehensive instructions and a clear quick start guide, it might have a more positive impact. On the positive side, using a method like this reduces the mental load for people, especially if used without a PIN code. If using n-Auth allowed people to log into several services without an extra set of credentials, it would please many who find passwords and PIN codes frustrating and difficult to remember.

#### B.8 Lessons Learned
While we focused on simplicity, it is clear that we also need to provide better instructions and documentation to the user, as is also one of the design principles of Molich and Nielsen [16].
