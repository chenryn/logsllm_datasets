machine. However, ﬁnding such bugs is considered a difﬁcult
task. Once a critical zero-day bug is discovered, it is quickly
patched by popular browser vendors such as Chrome and
Firefox.
Other risks come from vulnerabilities in the websites them-
selves, although it is challenging to ﬁnd security bugs in pop-
ular websites. An attacker who wants to take over an account
using classical web attacks like XSS [14] or CSRF [15], has to
intensely explore each of its target websites. Without ﬁnding a
vulnerability it is hard to know for sure whether the website is
vulnerable or not. Unlike PRMitM, in cross-site attacks [14]–
[16], [18] users must also be authenticated to the attacked
website.
On the other hand, more interaction between the attacking
page and the victim is required to launch PRMitM attacks.
Unlike clickjacking and some XSS attacks, where only a few
clicks are required, in PRMitM attacks, the victim is required
to perform an operation in the attacking page and to insert
at least a single minimal correct piece of information about
herself, e.g., a phone number.
The need to insert private information is similar to phishing
attacks in websites [13], [20]. However, in phishing attacks, the
attacking page impersonates a legitimate website and tricks the
victim into inserting her credentials (username and password).
In PRMitM attacks, the victim is only required to give personal
information (e.g., phone number) that users agree to give in
order to get some services (see Section II-A).
Sophisticated phishing attacks might also follow similar
application-level MitM approach to imitate legitimate websites
or during the entire login process [21], [22]. Such a MitM ap-
proach might overcome also 2-factor authentication schemes,
as the victim inserts codes and passwords into the phishing
website. Hence, one might miss the most signiﬁcant difference
between phishing and PRMitM attacks: the vulnerability itself.
Namely, for each of the attacks, there is a different answer to
the question what is being exploited?
Phishing attacks exploit the users; there is no bug in the
design of the attacked website and the attacker exploits unwary
users who ignore indications given to them by the browsers.
On the other hand, PRMitM attacks exploit bugs in the design
of password-reset process.
The greatest challenge of the phishing attacker is the im-
personation to another website. Users with minimal under-
standing can detect phishing attempts by carefully checking
the site URL and whether HTTPS is on. Other anti-phishing
solutions [23]–[26] make the launch of phishing attacks harder
also against other users. The PRMitM attack obviates the need
for impersonation; it can be launched naturally from every
website.
As the PRMitM attack exploits server-side design bug, de-
pending on the severity of the vulnerability, there is no chance
for the users and other client-side defenses (e.g., browser built-
in mechanisms or extensions) to detect the attack.
Table I summarizes the comparison.
III. MITM IN PASSWORD RESET PROCESS
This section describes the basic password reset MitM (PR-
MitM) attack, and presents the challenges and difﬁculties of
the attacker. This section also surveys the mechanisms used
by popular websites during the password recovery process.
A. Password Reset MitM Attack
The basic PRMitM attack exploits the similarity between
the registration process and the password reset process. In both
the processes, it is common to solve CAPTCHA challenges,
answer security questions, get a conﬁrmation link to the email,
or to type in a code that is sent to a phone number. Hence, the
attacker can take challenges from a password reset process of

a user, and present them to her as legitimate challenges during
the registration process.
We now describe the attack in detail. For simplicity, we
describe the attacked website as the email service provider of
the victim. When a user initiates a registration process in the
attacker’s website, the attacker either asks the user to identify
herself with her email address or launches another cross-site
attack to extract it [14]–[18].
Once the attacker knows the victim’s email address, he
already knows both her email service provider and her user-
name in this service. The attacker initiates a password reset
procedure against the attacked website with the email address
of the victim.
The attacker acts as man in the middle between the victim
user and the attacked website in the password reset procedure.
The attacker forwards almost every challenge (see Section
III-C) from the attacked website to the victim under the cover
of the registration process.
This process is illustrated in Figure 1. Given the email
address of the victim, the attacker can similarly initiate a
password reset process in the name of the victim in other
websites, e.g., Facebook.
B. Challenges
We now discuss the four most common challenges that the
attacker may encounter during the password reset process. The
challenges are described from the easiest to the most difﬁcult.
1) CAPTCHA Challenges: CAPTCHA challenges [11] do
not aim to prevent an attacker from resetting the password, but
rather aim to prevent the attacker from doing this automati-
cally. A human attacker should be able to solve CAPTCHA
challenges just like a human victim. However, to launch the
PRMitM attack on a larger scale it is necessary to solve them
automatically. Therefore, the PRMitM attacker forwards the
CAPTCHA challenges to the victim users, and forwards the
solutions submitted by them back to the attacked website.
2) Security Question: Another identiﬁcation challenge is
presented by security questions. During the registration, users
are sometimes asked to answer personal question(s) that will
be used to identify them in case the password is lost or
forgotten. When the attacker receives a security question in the
password reset process, he can just forward this question to the
victim who is currently registering to the attacker’s website.
The attacker will forward the user’s answer on to the attacked
website.
3) Code to the Mobile Phone: Authentication can be done
via one of three approaches: (1) something you know (e.g.,
password), (2) something you are (e.g., ﬁngerprints), and (3)
something you have (e.g., special token device or a phone).

Therefore, when users forget their password, many websites
allow them to authenticate themselves via something they
have, like a mobile phone. This is usually done by sending a
message with a password reset code to the phone of the user
via SMS. Some websites also support an automated phone call
to the user, in which the code is given. The user is required to
insert this code in order to change her password. In Section
IV, we analyze the different messages sent by popular websites
and show that it is possible launch a PRMitM attack also in
this case. In Section V, we show that phone calls are also
vulnerable to the attack.
4) Reset Link to the Email: The most common counter-
measure involves sending a link to reset the password of the
victim’s email address. To bypass this mechanism, the attacker
must be able to access data in the email account of the victim;
therefore, the PRMitM attack cannot be applied on websites
that allow password reset only by sending a reset link to the
email. Unfortunately, this option is usually not relevant for
the email services themselves. Moreover, relying only on this
option blocks password recovery when users have lost access
to their email account.
C. Challenges in Popular Websites
1 We surveyed the challenges used during the password reset
process by the most popular websites in the world [27]. Table
II summarizes the ﬁndings. The 10 most popular websites
support password reset using the user’s email account and most
of them allow password reset using a phone as an alternative.
1The challenges survey that
is summarized in Tables II and III was
conducted during the second quarter of 2016.

Google is the only one that also supports security questions,
and three of them require solving a CAPTCHA in addition to
one of the ﬁrst two challenges.
We also surveyed popular email-services, because those
have difﬁculty offering an email-based password recovery
process. Email-services are usually very sensitive; by obtaining
access to the victim’s email account, an attacker can further
reset the password of other websites.
The challenges used by popular email-services that do not
appear in Table II, are summarized in Table III. We chose only
email services to which we could register, all of them from
USA, Russia, India, and Germany.
Among these 10 email services, we found that Yandex,
one of the most popular websites in the world, mail.com,
gmx.com and reddif.com allow password recovery by only
answering a security question and solving a CAPTCHA. In
Yandex, this option is possible only for users who did not
input their phone and alternative email. This makes these
websites vulnerable to a simple variant of the PRMitM attack,
in which the attacker only forwards the security question and
the CAPTCHA challenge to the victim to solve, and then takes
over the account.
Google also supports password recovery using security
questions. However, Google’s mechanism is mainly based
on activities done by the user in the account, and on other
parameters like the IP address and the browser used by
the requester. Although Google also uses general security
questions in some cases, PRMitM attack alone cannot be used
to overcome the security questions. See also Section VII-A.
Clearly, most of the popular websites and email services
support authentication using a mobile phone. In Sections IV
and V, we show that sending the reset password code by SMS
or phone call is also vulnerable to attack.
D. Evaluation: PRMitM with Security Question
As some websites still allow password reset that relies on se-
curity questions, we conducted a small user study (Experiment
1) to test whether or not users provide the correct answers for
such questions. Since popular websites do not rely on security
questions, we could not recruit participants and simulate a real
attack on their accounts.
Yet, under the assumption that users who give the correct
answer in a low-importance website would also correctly
answer their security question in more reputable websites,
the experiment should offer a good indication. Although not
analyzed in this experiment, users who give the same wrong
answer to both the attacked and the attacking websites, are
