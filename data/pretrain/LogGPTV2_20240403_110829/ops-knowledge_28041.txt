Assistant: At 17-06-09 20:10:54, the system began reading broadcast variable 20, assigned tasks 478 and 479, stored broadcast_20_piece0 and broadcast_20 in memory, and computed partitions rdd_16_0, rdd_16_4, rdd_16_3, rdd_16_2, and rdd_16_1. Additionally, it found blocks rdd_2_0, rdd_2_4, rdd_2_3, rdd_2_2, and rdd_2_1 locally and recorded times for total, boot, init, and finish.
