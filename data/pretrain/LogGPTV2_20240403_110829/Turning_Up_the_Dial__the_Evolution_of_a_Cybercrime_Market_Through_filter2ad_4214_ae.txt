implications for the clustering results. As k-means clustering re-
lies on distances, it is expected one cluster will be significantly
larger, representing the general low-volume activity of most mem-
bers. However, it is the outliers we are interested in, as these capture
both the users who successfully overcame the ‘cold start’ problem,
and users who have significantly different activity to most members,
such as a higher number of disputes. To explore these outliers, we
again cluster this group of 122 members, finding eight clusters (see
Table 7). We use cluster G, with the highest proportion of members,
as the baseline group for comparison.
Clusters B and G have the highest proportion of members, with
B having a lower marketplace post count, and higher number of
accepted contracts and positive ratings. Cluster A has the highest
number of post counts, but a lower number of accepted contracts
than the baseline. Cluster F has more marketplace posts, while
cluster C has a significantly greater number of disputes and negative
ratings, and cluster H has the second most disputes and negative
ratings, with more members than cluster C. Cluster D has the most
initiated contracts, indicating these members are making as well
as receiving contracts. Cluster E has the most positive ratings and
accepted contracts.
The median lifespan of activity of new users on the contract
system in Stable is less than one day, while for the group of outliers,
it is 250 days. Of all cold starters in Stable, 13.0% of members,
and 54.1% of members in the group of outliers, continue accepting
contracts into Covid-19. Looking at reputation voting, the median
reputation score for cold starters in Stable is 33, while it is 157
for the outlier group. Members starting in Set-up have a median
reputation score of 96, which is greater than starters in Stable.
This is due to more members in Set-up having an existing presence
in the marketplace, before the contract system started.
Types of Products and Services. As Wegberg et al. [25] found
product characteristics influence sales volumes, we investigate the
types of products or services being marketed. We qualitatively anal-
yse threads associated with public transactions, which serve as
advertisements for a given product or service, to reveal the extent
product type drives trade. For this analysis, we only consider the
completed contracts of high volume users in Stable. We find that
in the context of the ‘cold start’ problem, the transaction type plays
an important role. The majority of these members build their repu-
tation by participating in Exchange, where a product is exchanged
for another item. A proportion of these users only offer items on an
exchange basis, while the remainder are involved in Sale and other

types of contracts. Most Exchange are for currency exchange, such
as PayPal to Bitcoin (and vice versa), Ethereum to Bitcoin, PayPal
to Apple Pay, Bitcoin to Cashapp, and Bitcoin for Giftcards. A small
proportion of users do not participate in Exchange, instead estab-
lishing themselves by offering products and services. These include
eWhoring packs and tutorials, the ‘YouTube method’ (usually tutor-
ing in basic passive income schemes such as dropshipping), hosting,
botnets, and software upgrades/licenses.
Trust and Reputation. To understand the role of trust and rep-
utation in the cold-start problem, we model completed contracts
using Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) models and the cold start variables
(including controls). The ZIP models provide statistical estimates
on two processes: the expected number of completed contracts (the
count model) and the odds of having zero completed contracts (the
zero-inflation model) for users in the contract system. We run the
full-sample models for all eras and the sub-sample models (first-
time users and existing users) for Stable and Covid-19. Given their
skewed distributions, all variables, with the exception of length
and number of completed contracts, are transformed using the
square-root function. We note the variables for all count models
are measured for each era. Results from Vuong tests for all models
suggest the ZIP models are better-fitted for the data.
During Covid-19, there are 2,569 first-time users and 5,275 exist-
ing users of the contract system. Both the count and zero-inflation
models with all users yields comparable results to the Stable era.
First-time users continue to have fewer completed contracts but
had lowered odds of zero completed contracts. As a sub-group, first-
time users with more positive rating and posts in marketplace had
lower expected number of completed contracts. This differs from
Stable where trustworthiness was assessed based on negative feed-
back and disputes. These effects are, however, absent for existing
During Set-up, there are 6,278 users of the new contract system.
In general, the more active users are with the contract system during
Set-up, the more completed contracts they had. For example, an
increase of one post in the marketplace increases the expected
number of completed contracts by 1.04. The zero-inflation model
shows that users’ negative ratings and length of activities lower
the odds of having zero completed contracts by 0.578 and 0.991
respectively. Disputes also lower the odds, but are not statistically
significant. The results suggest that despite negative feedback from
other users, first adopters of the contract systems who were active
were successful in completing transactions during Set-up.
In Stable, with 16,123 first-time contract users and 3,534 existing
users, the count model shows comparable results to Set-up, suggest-
ing that active users in the contract system continue to have success
with transaction completion. Being first-time users did decrease the
number of expected contracts but they were not penalised in terms
having any completed contracts, as indicated in the zero-inflation
model in Table 9. The sub-group results show that first-time users
who received more negative ratings and had disputed contracts
had lower number of completed contracts and increased odds of
zero completed contracts, respectively. Existing users are not pe-
nalised with the same cautiousness, as having negative ratings and
disputes respectively increased the number of completed contracts
and lower the odds of having zero completed contracts. The results
suggest first-time users of the contract system were treated with
suspicion during Stable.
users. The effect of disputes on lowering odds of zero-completed
contracts remain for existing users during Covid-19. The findings
suggest that first-time users are held to different standards of trust-
worthiness then existing users.
6 DISCUSSION
The Hack Forums marketplace provides a range of trust capabili-
ties to facilitate trade between pseudonymous parties. By having
a semi-public record of all transactions, the marketplace affords
users a trust infrastructure, which allows new users with no estab-
lished reputation build up trust through making initial small-scale
exchanges which are publicly recorded. As with other contempo-
rary online markets, measurement has become a core part of trust.
Tracked transactions and semi-visible histories are signals of rep-
utability that go beyond a single reputation number or patchy list
of feedback. Given the majority of transactions are private, with
only minimal details provided, the overall outcome of this new mar-
ketplace is to further centralise control (under the guise of a public
trust mechanism) to the forum administrators. Having administra-
tors act as third-party arbitrators is similar to the mediation model
in many legitimate marketplaces, such as eBay or Amazon, where
disputes are mediated by the platform. This increases trust in the
intermediaries, particularly buyers’ trust toward the marketplace
itself. In addition to studying the trust functions facilitated by this
marketplace, we track its evolution over three main eras.
The Set-up Era. The market forms in the first era, with users grad-
ually shifting to the new platform. Initially Exchange contracts
are split between large numbers of small-scale users (who make
single currency exchanges) and power-users. We see an increase
in Exchange, largely driven by power-users who then dominate
this contract type. Purchase is dominated by ‘small-fry’, with the
growth in transactions almost entirely driven by single transaction
users, with takers split between small-fry and a small number of
power-users. Sale is dominated by small-scale users in this era.
Although this period begins with an even mix of public and private
transactions, it shifts in favour of private transactions towards its
end, when contracts become compulsory. We do not see the growth
in this era of a ‘concentrated’ market, with small-scale users dealing
with other small-scale users, and power-users with other power-
users. Thus, as the market slowly grows, it is not turning into a
‘business to customer’ market. This has important implications for
trust mechanisms across Set-up, as the trust function of recording
transactions is likely to play only a small role where individuals
make or accept only a single transaction. Thus, in Set-up, we con-
clude that the market largely facilitates the growth of relationships
between power-users, rather than the establishment of trusted
traders used by large numbers of small-scale users.
Although Tuckman’s theory of group development relates to
group interactions with a common goal, rather than competitive
entrepreneurial markets, its general contentions with respect to
group formation are useful, given sustained facilitation of trust and
exchange is a group endeavour in which all users (apart from scam-
mers) are involved. In particular, when conceived more broadly as
pertaining to social interaction, Tuckman’s theory draws out useful
longitudinal aspects of conflict and consensus. In the forming era,
with groups coming together, and the subsequent ‘storming’ phase,

aspects of intra-group conflict emerge that need to be resolved.
Thus, we argue that this gradual and dispersed Set-up era reflects
individuals testing the system and establishing their orientations
with respect to one another (as we see from the super-user to super-
user transaction patterns). We also see evidence of the ‘storming’
phase at the end of this era, with a spike in disputes before the
transition to Stable.
The Stable Era. There is a considerable shift in the composition
and scale of the market when contracts become compulsory. While
far more transactions are being made, the majority (around 88%)
are now private, meaning other users can only see limited feedback
and the transaction type. The market sustains a diverse range of
behaviours and products over this period. We observe the growth
of ‘business to customer’ patterns of trade, with individual power-
users beginning to cultivate large numbers of small-scale customers,
rather than trading with one another.
The influx of customers appears to accelerate competition (and
hence, conflict), accelerating progression to the norming phase, our
Stable era. Power-users who established themselves over the Set-
up period capitalise on the reputation and trust they have built up,
and alongside newer would-be power-users, are well-positioned
to capitalise on the influx of small-scale custom. Hence, the trust
relationships facilitated by the market infrastructure shift between
these two phases - from a forming, orienting function to one which
more closely resembles trust relationships within a traditional mar-
ket, with clear producers and consumers.
The Covid-19 Era. The most timely aspect of this paper relates to
the initial effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the market for cyber-
crime products and services. Across all our measures, we conclude
that the effects of Covid-19 are a stimulus rather than a trans-
formation. The same kinds of transactions, users, and behaviours
dominate as during Stable, however volumes increase for all prod-
uct categories. In terms of users, we see an uplift in numbers across
most categories, but particularly in users making small numbers
of Sale. In the short term, this returned the market to the state it
was in at its previous peak (from which it had been steadily declin-
ing). We observe increases in currency exchanges, and most other
product categories. Much of the increase in transactions is due to
increased flows of merchandise and currency between small-scale
actors and power-users, suggesting that the crisis has concentrated
the market around these power-users. Thus, it is largely existing
power-users who benefit from the opportunities provided by the
Covid-19 crisis.
We believe that the most convincing explanation for this is situ-
ational. Rather than serious new forms of crime arising, the uplift
may result from changes in the everyday lives of the people who use
this market. From consulting forum posts made on Hack Forums
during this period, the picture is one of mass boredom and economic
change. Younger users are confined to their homes with no school
and an abundance of time, while older users have either been laid
off work and are time-rich and money-poor (and hence desperate to
sell and exchange) or are spending their recently-received stimulus
cheques. Thus, coronavirus is ‘turning up the dial’ on the factors
already feeding into marketplace participation. We also note that
few products require shipping physical goods, so the trust mecha-
nisms are not being strained by the lockdown in the way that they
might be on, for example, drug-related cryptomarkets.
7 CONCLUSION
This is the first academic study, of which we are aware, on the evolu-
tion of an underground marketplace (including its shift through the
Covid-19 pandemic) using the contractual transactions made and
completed by the forum’s members. We have used quantitative anal-
ysis and statistical modelling approaches to outline the economic
shape of the forum’s market, including the sorts of goods and ser-
vices being exchanged, the money being made, preferred payment
methods used, changes in the market over time, and how users
overcome the ‘cold start’ problem when joining the market without
established trust and reputation. We conclude that the contract
system constitutes a useful trust infrastructure for participants.
The broader relevance of this paper to the security community
is threefold. First, our analysis of this novel dataset suggests that
centrally-held, mostly-public records of transactions provide a form
of trust and reputation infrastructure which appears to particularly
benefit the concentration of the market over time around a core of
power-users. This has implications for intervention, particularly for
approaches that involve confusing the ‘trust signals’ which make
up this public record. We suggest spurious negative reviews and
other forms of Sybil attack are best targeted in the early days of
market formation, before this concentration effect takes root and
while trade is largely between parties of similar size. Second, our
analysis represents a novel application of clustering methods to
a database of illicit transactions, demonstrating the usefulness of
traditional statistical modelling techniques such as LTA for tagging
and labelling large administrative datasets, facilitating data reduc-
tion and ‘data science’ analysis. Third, our analysis suggests the
pandemic has had an effect on the market, but mainly due to an
influx of small-scale customers which has largely benefited existing
power players, rather than enabling small-scale sellers to make a
jump to the ‘big leagues’.
Our dataset has some limitations. First, while contractual details
can be observed, we generally have no way to verify if transactions
actually go through with exact values as described. Where traders
specify the Bitcoin/Ethereum addresses or the transaction hashes,
the actual values on the blockchain can be confirmed, otherwise,
the dataset lacks ground truth verification. Moreover, even when
the transaction hash is provided, we have no way to verify its
integrity, as the dishonest parties could still find an appropriate
transaction on blockchain then put it into the contract details to
