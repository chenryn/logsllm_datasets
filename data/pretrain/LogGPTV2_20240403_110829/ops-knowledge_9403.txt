Formulate and implement security policies and procedures: establish a data security management system, including data classification, storage, transmission, access, backup, and recovery and other aspects, clarify the authority and responsibility, and ensure that data security is fully controllable. 2. Implement enhanced authentication measures: adopt multi-level authentication mechanisms and encryption technologies, such as passwords, biometrics, certificates, one-time passwords, etc., to ensure the accuracy and security of identity authentication. 3. Establish a vulnerability management and emergency response mechanism: establish a vulnerability management and emergency response mechanism to trace the source of the system and applications and repair vulnerabilities to deal with unknown risks and emergencies. 4. Strengthen monitoring and auditing: use comprehensive, real-time, and operable monitoring methods to realize comprehensive monitoring and recording of systems, networks, and data flows, identify abnormalities and risk events, and take corresponding measures to deal with them. 5. Implement security training and inspection: conduct security awareness training for relevant internal personnel of the enterprise, establish a sound security inspection mechanism, conduct centralized supervision and disposal of security loopholes and abnormal behaviors, and ensure continuous and effective data security.
