## 1. Introduction
During my tenure as a security engineer at Schuberg Philis, I frequently utilized vulnerability scanners such as Nessus and OpenVAS. These tools are powerful but not without their limitations. Each scan generates a report with numerous findings, which must be investigated to determine if they are:
- A genuine issue,
- Not an issue, or
- A false positive.

This investigative process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, often leading to scans being conducted only on an ad-hoc basis, such as before a system goes live or after significant changes. However, the dynamic nature of IT, where change is constant, necessitates regular vulnerability scans. To address this challenge, I developed Seccubus, a tool designed to schedule and simplify the processing of vulnerability scan results.

### 1.1 What is a Vulnerability Scanner?
A vulnerability scanner is a software program that identifies vulnerabilities in software or infrastructure by simulating attacks. Popular examples include Nessus and OpenVAS, which are used to find vulnerabilities in networked infrastructures. These scanners typically follow a five-step process:
1. Determine if an IP address is active on the network.
2. Identify the services and operating system of the IP address.
3. Check for known vulnerabilities.
4. Simulate or exploit the vulnerability to confirm its presence.
5. Generate a report of findings.

#### Known vs. Unknown Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability scanners can only detect known vulnerabilities—those that have been programmed into the tool. Human creativity, particularly that of skilled penetration testers, can uncover unknown vulnerabilities. Additionally, these scans can sometimes impact the availability of the tested infrastructure, although vendors cannot guarantee 100% safety.

### 1.2 Why Scan?
Despite the potential risks, I strongly recommend that companies and IT departments perform their own vulnerability scans for two key reasons:
- **Low Risk:** The risk of scanning is relatively low.
- **Public Accessibility:** Anyone can use freely available tools to scan your infrastructure, so it's better to have your own data.

#### Scanning Risks
While performing a vulnerability scan, one must balance confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Although scans may temporarily reduce availability, the information gained is valuable. In my experience, the risk of significant disruption is minimal, and any issues can usually be resolved quickly.

## 2. More Scanning, More Work?
Vulnerability scanning should not be a one-time activity. IT infrastructures are constantly changing, and new vulnerabilities are discovered daily. While running a scan is straightforward, analyzing the results can be overwhelming. For example, a scan of 130 IP addresses can generate a 52-page report with over 400 findings, requiring several hours to analyze.

### 2.1 How Does Seccubus Improve This?
Seccubus automates the execution and analysis of vulnerability scans. It schedules scans and computes the delta between current and previous scan results, reducing the time needed for analysis. Here’s how it works:
- **Initial Scan:** Seccubus produces standard reports and assigns each finding a "New" status.
- **Subsequent Scans:** Findings are assigned statuses based on the previous scan:
  - **New:** If the finding was not present in the previous scan.
  - **Changed:** If the finding has changed.
  - **Gone:** If the finding was present in the previous scan but not in the current one.

This approach allows assessors to focus only on the relevant findings, significantly reducing the workload.

### 2.2 What is the Gain?
Automating vulnerability scanning with Seccubus offers several advantages:
- **Scheduled Scans:** No need for manual initiation.
- **Improved Efficiency:** More scans can be performed with the same resources.
- **Enhanced Analysis:** Less time spent on mundane tasks, leading to higher-quality assessments.

### 2.3 Case: Schuberg Philis
Since August 2007, Schuberg Philis has used Seccubus to scan over 4,000 external IP addresses, resulting in 8,777 findings. Without Seccubus, this level of efficiency would be unattainable.

## 3. Conclusion
Seccubus streamlines the execution and analysis of vulnerability scans, enabling more frequent and efficient scans. This leads to the identification and remediation of more vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing overall security.
