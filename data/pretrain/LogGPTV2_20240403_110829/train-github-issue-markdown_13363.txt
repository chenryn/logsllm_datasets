### Apache Airflow version

### Operating System
debian (docker)
### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers
n/a
### Deployment
Astronomer
### Deployment details
Dockerfile:
`astro dev start`
    FROM quay.io/astronomer/ap-airflow-dev:2.2.2-onbuild-48058
Two dags:
    # one.py
    @task
    def a():
        print("a")
    @dag(schedule_interval=None, start_date=days_ago(2))
    def my_dag():
        a()
    dag = my_dag()
    # two.py
    @task
    def b():
        print("b")
    @dag(schedule_interval=None, start_date=days_ago(2))
    def my_dag():
        b()
    dag = my_dag()
Note that they share the same dag_id: `my_dag`
### What happened
Only one DAG appeared. In the tree-view, I would refresh the page and see the
task change between:
  * task_id: a
  * task_id: b
seemingly at random.
### What you expected to happen
At least, I expected a warning to appear. It seems that we used to have this:
#15302
I think that in the presence of a dag_id collision, we should either:
  * refuse to run that dag at all until the collision is resolved
  * resolve it deterministically
### How to reproduce
Include the two dags above and observe the "DAGs" view. Notice that there's
only one DAG and it's not clear which one it is.
### Anything else
_No response_
