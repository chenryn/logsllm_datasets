User: I have installed the new python release and would like to run .py files from the terminal.
How is this done from the terminal? I dont want to include the path in each command to run a .py file.
Assistant: I installed all of my python through macports, which has pros and cons. One of the benefits is that you don't have to worry about stuff like this, it just works. You can install python 2.6 and python 2.7 (and others), and then use the python_select utility to set up which python is run when you call "python blah.py"
