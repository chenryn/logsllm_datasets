User: Please explain how to deploy and manage applications in the Kubernetes cluster.
Assistant: In a Kubernetes cluster, application deployment and management can be performed through the following steps: 1. Create a Deployment object. The Deployment object is used to manage the number of Pod replicas and update strategies. 2. Store the application's container image in Docker Registry, or build the application in a Docker environment within the cluster. 3. Create a Pod template, which defines information such as resources and environment variables required by the application container. 4. Combine the Pod template and the Deployment object to create an actual collection of Pods. 5. Determine the Pod deployment strategy, such as rolling update or blue-green deployment. 6. Use the kubectl command line tool or the Kubernetes API interface to deploy and manage applications. 7. Monitor the running status of the application, such as monitoring the life cycle and resource usage of the Pod. 8. Scale and shrink applications as needed to meet changing business needs. It should be noted that the deployment and management of applications may involve multiple Kubernetes objects, such as Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, and Secret. The functions and functions of these objects need to be considered comprehensively during use to ensure that the application can run normally.
