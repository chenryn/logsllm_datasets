### Error Handling and Problem Diagnosis in IBM MQ

#### Error Messages and Conditions
When creating or modifying a channel, an error message is returned if:
- A duplicate channel name is chosen.
- Unacceptable data is entered in the channel parameter fields.
- The specified channel is ambiguous or does not exist.

**Problem Diagnosis:**
1. **Interpretation of Error Messages:** Begin by interpreting the error messages to understand the issue.
2. **Corrective Action:** Take appropriate corrective actions based on the error message.

#### Channel Operation Problems
During normal channel operation, any issues are logged to the system console, system log, or channel log (on Windows). 

**Problem Diagnosis:**
1. **Log Collection:** Gather all relevant information from the logs.
2. **Analysis:** Analyze the collected information to identify the problem.
3. **Error Messages:** Confirmation and error messages are returned to the terminal that initiated the commands, when possible.

**Network Issues:**
- In a network, problems can arise at intermediate systems. For example, a full transmission queue followed by a full dead-letter queue can cause the channel to close down.
- **Remote Site Contact:** If the error originates from a remote site, contact your counterpart at that site for detailed information and to be notified when the channel is available again.

#### Channel Startup Negotiation Errors
During channel startup, both ends must agree on running parameters. If they cannot agree, the channel closes down, and error messages are logged.

#### User Exit Problems
The interaction between channel programs and user-exit programs includes error-checking routines. These routines work effectively only if the user exits follow certain rules. When errors occur, the channel stops, and an error message is issued along with any return codes from the user exit.

**Diagnosis:**
- Use the trace facility of your host system to identify the problem.

#### Client Application Problems
A client application may receive unexpected error return codes such as:
- Queue manager not available
- Queue manager name error
- Connection broken

**Diagnosis:**
- Check the client error log for a message explaining the cause of the failure.
- There may also be errors logged at the server, depending on the nature of the failure.

**Note:**
- Even if a client application has terminated, its surrogate process might still hold queues open for a short time until the communications layer notifies that the partner has gone.

#### Diagnostic Messages and Reason Codes
For primary diagnosis, refer to the messages and reason codes provided by IBM MQ.

#### Accounting and Statistical Data
IBM MQ generates accounting and statistical data to help identify trends in utilization and performance:
- **Multiplatforms:** This information is produced as PCF records.
- **z/OS:** This information is produced as SMF records.

#### Data Structures
Data structures are essential for reference when checking logs and trace entries during problem diagnosis. For more information, see:
- Channel-exit calls and data structures
- Developing applications reference

#### Related Concepts
- **Channel Control Function**
- **Dead-letter Queue Considerations:** In some implementations, the dead-letter queue is referred to as an undelivered-message queue.

#### Dead-letter Queue Overflow
If a channel ceases to run, applications may continue to place messages on transmission queues, leading to potential overflow. The MCA handles this situation in several ways:
1. **Message-Retry Exit:** Calls the message-retry exit if defined.
2. **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ):** Directs overflow messages to the DLQ and returns an exception report to applications that requested it.
   - **Note:** Ensure the DLQ is defined, available, and sized for the largest messages.
3. **Channel Closure:** Closes the channel if neither of the previous options succeeds.
4. **Undelivered Messages:** Returns undelivered messages back to the sending end and provides a full report to the reply-to queue.

#### Monitoring Messages with dspmqrte
Use the `dspmqrte` command to determine the route a message takes through the queue manager network and its final location. This command can be run on all platforms except z/OS. For more information, see:
- IBM MQ display route application
- `dspmqrte` (display route information)

#### Using Ping to Test Communications
The `PING` command is useful for testing whether the communication link and message channel agents are functioning across all interfaces.

**Procedure:**
- **Multiplatforms:** Use `PING QMGR` to test if the queue manager is responsive to commands.
- **z/OS and IBM i:** Use `PING CHANNEL` to test a channel by sending data as a special message to the remote queue manager and checking if the data is returned.

#### Using SUBSTATE to Troubleshoot Channels
If a channel is running slowly or appears to have no messages to send, use the `SUBSTATE` field to diagnose the problem.

**Environment:**
- **Sender Channel Status:** `SUBSTATE(MQGET)`
- **Receiver Channel Status:** `SUBSTATE(RECEIVE)`

**Slow Channels:**
- **Substate Analysis:** If the sender channel is sitting in a network receive, it indicates slow line turnaround on the network.

**Hung Channels:**
- **BINDING State:** Substatus values help break down the operations happening while the channel is in BINDING state.
  - **Common Substates:**
    - Connecting to the network (`NETCONNECT`)
    - Making a DNS request (`NAMESERVER`)
    - SSL/TLS Handshake (`SSLHANDSHAKE`)
    - In an exit (`SENDEXIT`)

#### Troubleshooting a Channel That Refuses to Run
If a channel refuses to run, check the following:
1. **Setup Verification:** Ensure DQM and channels are set up correctly.
2. **In-doubt Channels:** Check if the channel is in-doubt and resolve it manually if necessary.
3. **Manual Restart:** If the receiver end is STOPPED, reset it by starting the receiver end.

**Commands:**
- `RESOLVE CHANNEL` (to resolve in-doubt messages)
- `RESET CHANNEL` (to reset message sequence number)

#### Troubleshooting Triggered Channels
If a triggered channel refuses to run, check for in-doubt messages and the trigger control parameter on the transmission queue.

**Procedure:**
1. **In-doubt Check:** Investigate the possibility of in-doubt messages.
2. **Trigger Control Parameter:** Check if the trigger control parameter is set to `NOTRIGGER`.
3. **Manual Start:** After diagnosing and fixing the problem, start the channel manually.

#### Troubleshooting Network Problems
Check the following if you are experiencing network problems:
- **LU 6.2 Definitions:** Ensure consistency throughout the network.
- **TCP Keepalive:** Set a KEEPALIVE value for your system or channels.
- **Group TCP/IP Listener:** Be aware of delays in address availability after registration with DDNS.

**User Intervention:**
- If the receiver channel is left in a 'communications receive' state, user intervention may be needed to address the problem.
- **Adopt MCA Function:** Automatically cancels a receiver channel and starts a new one in its place.
