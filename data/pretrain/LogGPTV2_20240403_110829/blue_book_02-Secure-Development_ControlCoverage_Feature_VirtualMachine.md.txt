### Virtual Machine Security Controls and Rationale

| Description | Rationale | Severity | Automated Fix Script Available? | Manual Fix Required? |
|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Virtual Machine should have the latest OS version installed** | Using the latest OS version significantly reduces risks from security design issues and security bugs present in older versions. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **OS automatic updates must be enabled on Windows Virtual Machines** | Disabling automatic updates can lead to missed security patches due to human error, increasing the risk of compromise from malware and trojan attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities. | High | Yes | No |
| **Antimalware must be enabled with real-time protection on Windows Virtual Machines** | Enabling antimalware protection minimizes the risks from various types of malware. Microsoft Antimalware provides real-time protection, scheduled scanning, malware remediation, signature updates, engine updates, samples reporting, and exclusion event collection. | High | Yes | No |
| **NSG must be configured for Virtual Machines** | Restricting inbound and outbound traffic via Network Security Groups (NSGs) limits the network exposure of a VM by reducing the attack surface. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Public IPs on a Virtual Machine should be carefully reviewed** | Public IPs provide direct internet access, exposing the VM to potential attacks. Each public IP on a VM must be reviewed carefully. | High | Yes | No |
| **Disk encryption must be enabled on both OS and data disks for Windows Virtual Machines** | Disk encryption ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest, minimizing the risk of data loss from physical theft and helping meet regulatory compliance requirements. Both OS and data disks may contain sensitive information. | High | Yes | No |
| **Virtual Machine must be in a healthy state in Azure Security Center** | Azure Security Center raises alerts for resources that are not compliant with baseline security protections. Resolving these alerts promptly eliminates exposure to attacks. | High | Yes | No |
| **Virtual Machine must have all required OS patches installed** | Unpatched VMs are easy targets for malware and trojan attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems and related software. | High | Yes | No |
| **Virtual Machine must implement all flagged ASC recommendations** | Azure Security Center provides security recommendations for non-compliant resources. Promptly resolving these recommendations eliminates exposure to attacks. | High | Yes | No |
| **Diagnostics (IaaSDiagnostics extension on Windows; LinuxDiagnostic extension on Linux) must be enabled on Virtual Machines** | Diagnostics logs are essential for creating activity trails during incident or compromise investigations. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Do not leave management ports open on Virtual Machines** | Open remote management ports expose VMs to high-risk internet-based attacks that attempt to brute force credentials to gain admin access. | Critical | Yes | No |
| **Vulnerability assessment solution should be installed on VMs** | Known OS/framework vulnerabilities can be easy targets for attackers. A vulnerability assessment solution helps detect and address these vulnerabilities in a timely manner. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Guest Configuration extension must be deployed to the VM using Azure Policy assignment** | Installing the Guest Configuration extension allows you to run In-Guest Policies on the VM, enabling compliance checks for system and security policies. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Guest config extension should report compliant status for all in-guest policies** | In-guest policies cover various native security requirements. A VM that is compliant has a lower overall exposure to getting compromised. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **All VM extensions required as per your Org policy must be deployed to the VM** | One or more extensions may be required for maintaining data plane security hygiene and visibility for all Azure VMs in use at an organization. Ensuring all required extensions are installed and in a healthy provisioning state is crucial. | Medium | Yes | No |

This table provides a comprehensive overview of the security controls and their rationale for virtual machines, ensuring a clear and structured approach to maintaining a secure environment.
