Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Timestamp: 2023-06-15 04:06:20
Severity: ALERT
Component: logrotate
Message: Exited abnormally with status [1]
```

### Explanation:
- **Timestamp**: Combined the date and time into a standard ISO 8601 format.
- **Severity**: Extracted "ALERT" as the severity level.
- **Component**: Identified "logrotate" as the component.
- **Message**: Simplified the message to clearly indicate the abnormal exit and its status code.

This format is more standardized and easier to read, making it suitable for log management and analysis.
