User: I have different python versions installed on my ubuntu machine. The default version is 2.7.
So when I install any new python module, for example using:
#apt-get install python-nfqueue
it will be istalled just for the default version (2.7)
How can I install the new modules for the other versions?
Is there a way to do it using apt-get install?
Thank you!
Assistant: You should install Python libraries with the Python package installer, pip.
Create a virtualenv with the Python version you want to use, activate it, and do pip install NetfilterQueue. You'll still need to install the system dependencies (eg libnetfilter-queue-dev in this case) with apt-get.
