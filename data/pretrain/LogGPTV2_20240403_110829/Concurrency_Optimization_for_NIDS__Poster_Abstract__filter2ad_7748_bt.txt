**Presenting Author:** Joaquim Jaumot, IDAEA-CSIC, Spain  
**Co-Author:** Elena Ortiz

In the field of omics sciences, there is a growing trend toward integrating data from different omics levels. Advanced processing tools and novel data fusion strategies have been developed to gather information, providing a better understanding of underlying biological processes. However, multi-omics data from various sources are heterogeneous, making the extraction of meaningful information through data fusion a significant challenge. Different strategies have been proposed for data fusion, which can be categorized based on the processing phase at which the data is combined:
1. **Low-level fusion** combines raw data to generate a new fused dataset for analysis.
2. **Mid-level fusion** involves joining subsets of relevant variables from different datasets.
3. **High-level fusion** merges results from independent analyses for a combined interpretation.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on regulatory pathways in zebrafish embryos using non-targeted LC-MS-based metabolomics and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Independent metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses revealed similar sets of altered pathways, despite differences in the number of detected potential biomarkers. We then employed various integration approaches to gain deeper insights into the affected metabolomic pathways, primarily signaling pathways, to identify any discrepancies in the information provided by the two omic levels.

### P-473: The Power of MS/MSALL Acquisition for High-Throughput Metabolomics Studies
**Presenting Author:** Mariateresa Maldini, SCIEX, Italy  
**Co-Authors:** Eva Duchoslav, Cyrus Papan, Khatereh Motamedchaboki

Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) with an electrospray source provides a simple technique that maximizes analytical throughput while allowing metabolite separation by m/z in complex samples. This method, combined with data-independent MS/MSALL acquisition, allows for fast qualitative and quantitative sample profiling. The MS/MSALL acquisition, a sequential precursor ion fragmentation technique, captures high-resolution MS and MS/MS data for every mass. A MultiQuant processing method was constructed using experimental MS/MS spectra from the Accurate Mass Metabolite Spectral Library (SCIEX).

To minimize the effect of mixed MS/MS spectra, responses for up to five unique fragments, including the unfragmented molecular ion, were extracted for each target metabolite. Calibration curves were constructed for 35 representative compounds. For example, in the positive ion mode, the % CV for Tryptamine replicate measurements was less than 15%, and the linear dynamic range was greater than 200 (coefficient of determination r² > 0.95) based on groups of three independent fragments.

More than 70% of spiked compounds in the standard mix and more than 50% in the urine matrix were identified, with additional compound classifications. These preliminary data, complemented with statistical analysis, illustrate the potential of the MS/MSALL approach for high-throughput metabolomics studies, combining fast, semi-quantitative profiling with confidence in compound identity and the potential for identifying unexpected secondary metabolites.

### P-474: Novel Visual Analytics Platforms for Multi-Omics Integration and Network Visualization
**Presenting Author:** Guangyan Zhou, McGill University, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Huiting Ou, Jianguo Xia

Multi-omics integration is a powerful strategy for simultaneously analyzing and interpreting multiple datasets from different omics technologies. It aims to provide a systems-level understanding of disease states and other experimental conditions by revealing novel mechanistic insights into molecular pathways. There is a pressing need for user-friendly bioinformatics tools dedicated to multi-omics network integration and visualization.

To address these challenges, we are developing two web-based platforms: OmicsAnalyst and OmicsNet. OmicsAnalyst facilitates access to multivariate methods such as O2PLS, Procrustes analysis, multiblock PCA, and PLS. It uses advanced visual analytics techniques, including 3D scatter plots and interactive heatmaps, to deconvolute the complex outputs of these methods. OmicsNet enables users to create and merge different types of biological networks and visualize them using an innovative WebGL-based system in 3D space. Users can query known interactions between seven different types of elements, including SNPs, genes/proteins, TFs, miRNAs, metabolites, mass peaks, and phenotypes, within the context of current knowledge.

### P-475: Matching Untargeted Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry Features Across Multiple Cohorts: Finding the Same Needles in Several Haystacks Via Networks
**Presenting Author:** Rui Climaco Pinto, Imperial College London, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** Ibrahim Karaman, Matt R. Lewis, Jenny Hällqvist, Manuja Kaluarachchi, Gonçalo Graça, Elena Chekmeneva, Mohammad Arfan Ikram, Abbas Dehghan, Paul Elliott, Ioanna Tzoulaki, David Herrington, Timothy Ebbels

In untargeted metabolomics, accurate within-dataset feature matching is facilitated by accessing large amounts of chromatographic/spectral information in each sample. However, when matching features from multiple cohorts/batches that used the same analytical method but were acquired and peak-picked separately, only limited information is available, often just retention time and m/z (RT-MZ) medians.

We propose a new cross-cohort matching method that uses RT-MZ median values of each feature, along with optional feature intensity and other quality measures. Initially, matches within manually-defined RT-MZ thresholds between all one-to-one dataset combinations are detected. In the next key step, a network of features (nodes) is built based on those matches (edges). Only matches in subnetworks (connected components) where all nodes are connected to all other nodes (maximal cliques) are accepted, removing features that matched by chance. If some features present multiple matching possibilities, a third step using RT-MZ differences to define a match-quality score is used to decide the best single matches.

We illustrate the method's performance by matching thousands of features from large studies of serum samples and inspecting the matching accuracy of hundreds of manually annotated metabolites, and by examining several feature-quality metrics. The method is not computationally intensive; for example, matching three cohorts, each with thousands of features, takes less than a minute on a typical desktop machine. This new approach addresses a key problem in metabolomics studies and promises to make the analysis of large untargeted multi-cohort datasets a viable option.

### P-476: On-Demand Construction of Deep Reference Libraries and How They Improve Compound ID
**Presenting Author:** Michal Raab, HighChem Ltd., Slovakia  
**Co-Authors:** Jakub Mezey, Samuel Benkovič, Melissa Montoya, Tim Stratton, Robert Mistrík

Compound identification through library searching is a leading application in LC/MS, but it relies heavily on the quality and coverage of available spectral libraries. Experimental diversity and hard-to-reproduce fragmentation drive the volume of LC/MS libraries to grow disproportionately compared to GC/MS, posing challenges for data processing, management, and searching applications.

We describe an integrated pipeline for high-throughput acquisition of reference compounds and semi-supervised curation using dedicated software for automated instrument control and a scalable modular microservices-based architecture for quality control, curation, annotation, and continuous delivery of library records. This system has been employed to handle the reference standards in the mzCloud library, expanding the coverage of unique compounds by 7,500 in two months. HRAM-MS/MS data was acquired for reference standards by nanoinfusion using an automated tool that acquired fragmentation data at increasing NCE (Normalized Collision Energy) levels of 10-200 in increments of 10. Intelligent controlling software was deployed for batch-like data-dependent MSn acquisition of reference compounds.

A collection of data processing services was built using a docker-based microservice platform, including feature detection/extraction, noise filtering, annotation, fragment prediction, and mass error correction. Additionally, separate quality control services are employed for real-time data inspection. A web-based frontend is used to monitor and control the processing queue, applying a sequence of processing services from one of the pre-defined profiles individually for each spectral reference dataset, and to provide feedback through quality control indicators.

### P-477: Integrating Polygenic Risk Scores and Metabolite Quantitative Trait Loci to Infer Dysregulated Mechanisms in Rheumatoid Arthritis Subtypes in Women
**Presenting Author:** Su Chu, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Jing Cui, Jeffrey A. Sparks, Bing Lu, Clary Clish, Jessica Lasky-Su, Elizabeth Karlson, Karen Costenbader

**Background:** Rheumatoid arthritis polygenic risk scores (RA-PRS) improve RA risk prediction, but the added predictive value over clinical variables is modest. Several human leucocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes are strongly related to seropositive RA, a severe subtype. Recently, we identified several metabolites associated with RA risk. Integrating RA-PRS and metabolomics may provide insight into RA pathogenesis.

**Methods:** Plasma samples from 254 pre-RA cases in the Nurses’ Health Studies were analyzed using untargeted liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (360 unique metabolites after quality control). PRS comprised 1) non-HLA 93 single nucleotide variants (PRS93), and 2) HLA haplotypes (HLA-PRS) previously associated with RA risk. Using ordinary least squares, associations between both PRS93 and HLA-PRS and individual metabolites were tested to identify RA-related metabolite quantitative trait loci (metaboQTLs). Interaction models assessed effect modification by RA serostatus.

**Results:** After multiple comparison adjustment using the pooled local index of significance, no PRS93 metaboQTLs were found; however, 27 RA HLA-PRS metaboQTLs were identified, including those involved in branched chain amino acid and polyamine metabolism: C2 carnitine (β=0.120; padj=0.018), C3:carnitine (β=0.122; padj=0.007), C5:1 carnitine (β=0.120; padj=0.016), 4-acetamidobutanoate (β=0.134; padj=0.027), and N-acetylputrescine (β=0.119; padj=0.011). Two findings suggesting effect modification of metabolite levels by seropositivity were observed in RA-HLA metaboQTLs: C5:1 carnitine (p-interaction=0.068) and arecaidine (p-interaction=0.077).

**Conclusions:** We identified several metaboQTLs of HLA haplotypes in pre-RA, but none for PRS93. Evidence to support effect modification of the HLA-PRS and metabolite association by RA serostatus was identified for one acylcarnitine and one alkaloid derivative. Further validation is required.

### P-478: Food Metabolome Repository: A Database for Cross-Sample Specificity-Based Peak Prioritization in Untargeted Metabolomics
**Presenting Author:** Nozomu Sakurai, National Institute of Genetics, Japan  
**Co-Author:** Kunihiro Suda

A major issue in mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomics is the lack of information to prioritize candidate peaks for further detailed investigation. The primary bottleneck is the annotation of compound peaks due to the limited availability of authentic standards for identification. Many computational tools and databases have been developed for predicting metabolites using accurate mass values, isotopic ion patterns, and MS/MS spectra. However, the highest-scoring candidate is not always correct, requiring one-by-one validation based on other information such as literature knowledge of the candidate compound's occurrence in nature.

To address this, we developed the Food Metabolome Repository (http://metabolites.in/foods). This repository includes untargeted metabolome data obtained from 222 foods using reversed-phase liquid chromatography-high resolution MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive and negative modes. The searching and acquiring functions can be integrated into other computational tools for automatic and large-scale processing via application programming interfaces (APIs).

### P-479: Toward a High-Quality Non-Targeted Analysis of Large Metabolomics Data
**Presenting Author:** Masahiro Sugimoto, Keio University, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Rintaro Saito, Tomoyoshi Soga, Masaru Tomita, Toru Takebayashi

Metabolomics cohort studies are becoming more widespread. Data processing and correcting data to remove unexpected biases are crucial for quality control (QC). We conducted the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study, enrolling 11,002 community-dwelling adults in Japan. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) was used for the identification and quantification of hydrophilic metabolites in human plasma.

We developed MasterHands, a Java-based GUI software capable of versatile data analysis of CE-MS data. We upgraded this software to include an application programmable interface for Python. We prepared two types of programs: one for non-targeted and the other for targeted analyses. First, we conducted a non-targeted analysis of QC samples, and analysts curated the analyzed data to optimize analytical parameters for individual peaks. The characteristics of curated peaks were used as training data for subsequent analysis. Other samples were analyzed using the targeted analysis program, with peak integration automatically adjusted based on the training data. These two-step analyses enable high-quality data processing even in large-scale datasets. Here, we show the algorithm and the performance of the processed data.

### P-480: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Circulating Plasma Metabolite Levels Identifies Differences by Sex and Suggests That Metabolites Represent Polygenic Traits
**Presenting Author:** Oana Zeleznik, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Oana A. Zeleznik, Xia Jiang, Rachel Kelly, Marta Guasch, Constance Turman, Jessica Lasky-Su, Clary B. Clish, A. Heather Eliassen, Peter Kraft

**Background:** Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with disease risk, but the mechanisms driving these associations remain largely unknown. Understanding the effects of SNPs on the metabolome of healthy individuals may elucidate the mechanisms linking SNPs to disease. We performed a GWAS of circulating plasma metabolomics (metaboQTLs) in 4,390 participants of the Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), NHS II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). We also performed a genome-wide screen for metaboQTLs showing differences by sex.

**Methods:** Linear regression of metabolite levels and genotype, adjusted for age, cohort, fasting status, and the first four genotype principal components, was used to identify metaboQTLs. Cochran’s Q-test was used to identify metaboQTLs showing heterogeneity by sex.

**Results:** Seventy-four metabolites were associated with 93 independent SNPs (p<2.3E-10). Individual SNPs were associated with 1-21 metabolites, and individual metabolites with 1-6 SNPs. The top identified metaboQTL (p=5.37E-248) was between a SNP next to carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) and glycine. CPS1 encodes an enzyme known to directly modify glycine. Fifteen of the 93 independent SNPs represent new metaboQTLs (LDr2<0.5 with published metaboQTLs). Twenty-three metaboQTLs showed genome-wide significant heterogeneity by sex. The metaboQTL of a SNP on the gene fatty acids dehydrogenase 2 (FADS2) and cholesteryl ester C20:4 showed the strongest evidence for sex differences (p=4.91E-39).

**Conclusion:** Multiple SNPs were associated with circulating metabolite levels. We identified new associations and validated previously published results. Several metaboQTLs showed heterogeneity by sex. Some metabolites were associated with multiple variants, suggesting that metabolites may represent polygenic traits.

### P-481: MsCompare: An Untargeted GC/MS Metabolomics Platform for Quality Control, Precise Deconvolution, and Data Analysis
**Presenting Author:** Marco Ruijken, MsMetrix, Netherlands

A GC/MS workflow for metabolomics includes several distinct steps: experimental design, sampling, sample preparation, data analysis, identification, and data interpretation. The MsCompare platform includes all tools to properly control each step in this workflow. One of the key issues in this field is the precise and sensitive detection of all components present in a series of samples. GC/MS deconvolution remains the most challenging step, especially for low-level components, particularly when highly similar co-eluting or nearly co-eluting compounds are present.

MsCompare contains several alignment algorithms to correct for poor peak shapes or reproducibility regarding retention times. Data analysis in MsCompare comprises both univariate and multivariate methods like PCA, PLS-DA, and clustering. However, it will be shown that, due to the high selectivity of GC/MS, univariate analysis methods are often adequate for solving the main questions. Examples from various studies (small and large) will be given, showing an overview of the workflow and implemented tools.

### P-482: A Statistical Approach to Classification of Mechanistic Computational Models of Parkinson’s Disease
**Presenting Author:** Lalithasushma Chakravadhanula, LIACS, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Agnieszka Wegrzyn, German Preciat, Alissa Schurink, Edinson Lucumi, Michael Emmerich, Ronan M.T. Fleming

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 7-10 million people worldwide. PD manifests with motor symptoms such as tremors and rigidity, and non-motor symptoms like depression and fatigue. Although the pathogenesis of PD remains unclear, several genetic and environmental factors are known to affect the progression of the disease. This project focuses on the discovery of changes in metabolism due to the PINK1 gene mutation. PINK1 is a mitochondrially targeted, serine/threonine protein kinase that protects cells from stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

We compare the effects of mitochondria-targeting inhibitors in patient and gene-corrected PINK1-Q456X cells, with healthy controls. Our data were generated from in vitro cultures of patient-derived human neuroepithelial stem cells, differentiated into dopaminergic neurons. A generic human genome-scale metabolic model was used to create a dopaminergic neuron-specific metabolic model. The steady-state solution spaces of constraint-based models of metabolism in patient and gene-corrected PINK1-Q456X cells were sampled, and the flux distributions for each reaction were compared.

Individual flux distributions may be diverse (uniform, normal, truncated, etc.), posing a challenge in statistical analysis. To address this, we developed an algorithm that classifies diverse flux distributions and highlights dissimilarities. Our approach allows us to study the differences in uptake and secretion rates between the patient, gene-corrected, and healthy control models, leading to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PINK1-PD.

### P-483: Extended Quality Control for Biocrates’ Targeted Metabolomics Kits
**Presenting Author:** Mathias Kuhring, Max Delbrück Center (MDC) for Molecular Medicine, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Alina Eisenberger, Raphaela Fritsche, Yoann Gloaguen, Dieter Beule, Jennifer Kirwan

Targeted mass spectrometry profiling methods optimized and validated for defined metabolites enable comprehensive routine metabolomics applications, such as the analysis of larger cohorts. However, comprehensive studies require consistent processing and reliable instrumentation to minimize technical variance and interference. Consequently, multiple and reproducible controls are required to verify data quality. While standardized methods such as the Targeted Metabolomics Kits of Biocrates promise consistent and comparable measurements, they are not fully resistant to external influences, including sample handling and processing errors, contamination, sample carryover, batch effects, intra-batch drift, edge effects, missing values of unknown origin, and instrument condition.

We present an extensive quality control procedure for targeted data acquired using Biocrates kits, designed to be complementary to the Biocrates MetIDQ software. Based on MetIDQ outputs, it combines several visualizations into a comprehensive HTML report using an R Notebook. These include visualizations of measured and missing values, positional irregularities with respect to acquisition sequence or well plate coordinates, and sample and metabolite variability and reproducibility. The tool supports Biocrates’ AbsoluteIDQ® p400 HR Kit and MxP® Quant 500 Kit, with most features applicable to other Biocrates kits exportable by MetIDQ. An R package will be made available under a permissive license. Overall, the report aids in verifying data consistency and quality or, if necessary, in identifying patterns of interference and removing low-quality samples or metabolites, thereby increasing confidence in data and subsequent analysis.

### P-484: Blend to Avoid Mixed Results
**Presenting Author:** Daniel Malmodin, Swedish NMR Centre, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Anders Pedersen, Göran Karlsson

By using blends of urine samples from participants in an NMR study, the problem of variation in salt concentrations and pH, causing variation in spectrum shifts, can be partly overcome. This results in increased accuracy of assignments and precision of concentration estimates, as well as providing a more formal way to quantify each estimate than currently available methods.

### P-485: A Novel Algorithm to Improve NMR Alignment of Urine Metabolomics Data by Spectral Reordering and Ridge Tracing
**Presenting Author:** Sicong Zhang, The University of Georgia, United States  
**Co-Author:** Arthur S. Edison

In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the chemical shifts of some resonances are sensitive to sample properties such as pH, salt concentration, temperature, and other matrix effects. This phenomenon challenges feature annotation and chemometric analysis in metabolomics research, necessitating data alignment processing steps. Urine is a widely used sample type in NMR metabolomics due to its simplicity in sample preparation and rich data. However, urine NMR samples are difficult to buffer, leading to large chemical shift variations.

Although different alignment algorithms have been developed, none of them perfectly solve this problem. Here, we present a new algorithm to improve urine NMR spectra alignment by reordering the spectra according to the chemical shift of an internal peak and then tracing responding peaks. We utilized DBSCAN-clustering to exclude mis-traced peaks and used confidence intervals of traced peaks to find missed peaks. All traced peaks were aligned and placed at the end of the original spectra for further analysis. Two human urine datasets were used for algorithm development, and significant improvement in peak alignment and STOCSY performance was observed. We will next compare results from this algorithm with other urine NMR analysis and alignment approaches. This work is expected to be generally useful for NMR processing to improve the accuracy and coverage of urine metabolomics studies.

**Co-Authors:** Arturas Grauslys, Andy Jones

TameNMR is an open-source web-server-based toolset for the analysis of 1D NMR datasets. Incorporating Bruker data and R packages, the University of Liverpool Computational Biology facility has developed a set of free-to-use tools that bridge the gap between raw NMR spectra and quantitative analysis.
