Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics to assess the effects of environmental pollutants
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Joaquim Jaumot, IDAEA-CSIC, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Elena Ortiz
In the framework of the omics sciences, there is a current trend towards the integration of information coming from different omics levels Advanced 
processing tools and novel data fusion strategies have been developed to gather information allowing a better understanding of the underlying 
biological processes However, multiomics data coming from multiple sources is heterogeneous, and the mining of information using these data 
fusion approaches remains a challenge Different strategies have been proposed to perform this data fusion In general, three approaches can be 
identified depending on the processing phase at which data is fused: 1) low-level fusion combines raw data to generate a new fused data to be 
analyzed, 2) mid-level fusion involves joining subsets of relevant variables from different datasets, and 3) high-level fusion just merges results from 
the independent analysis for a combined interpretation In this work, the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) in regulatory pathways of zebrafish embryos 
is evaluated by using a non-targeted LC-MS based metabolomics analysis and a high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) Independent 
metabolomics and transcriptomics results revealed a similar set of altered pathways despite the different number of detected potential biomarkers 
Then, different integration approaches have been employed to deepen knowledge about the affected metabolomic pathways (mainly signaling 
pathways) in an attempt to decipher possible divergences in the information provided by the two omic levels

The Power of MS/MSALL Acquisition for High-Throughput Metabolomics Studies
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mariateresa Maldini, SCIEX, Italy
CO-AUTHORS: Eva Duchoslav, Cyrus Papan, Khatereh Motamedchaboki
Flow Injection Analysis using an electrospray source gives a simple technique maximizing analytical throughput and yet allowing metabolite 
separation by m/z in complex samples by using a data independent MS/MSALL acquisition approachThis technique combined with tailored data 
processing methods built from the accurate mass metabolite spectral libraries allows fast qualitative and quantitative sample profilingThe MS/
MSALL acquisition, a sequential precursor ion fragmentation acquisition technique,with metabolome–tailored precursor mass defect captured 
high resolution MS and MS/MS for every massMultiQuant processing method was constructed using the metabolite experimental MS/MS spectra 
from the Accurate Mass Metabolite Spectral Library (SCIEX)To minimize the effect of mixed MS/MS spectra, MS/MS responses for series of up to 5 
unique fragments typically including unfragmented molecular ion, combined with a response in TOF MS were extracted for each target metabolite 
Calibration curves were constructed for set of 35 representative compounds For example, in the positive ion mode the % CV for Tryptamine 
replicate measurements was better than 15% and the linear dynamic range was greater than 200 (coefficient of determination r2 > 095) based 
on groups of 3 independent fragments More than 70% of spiked compounds in the standard mix and more than 50% of spiked compounds in the 
urine matrix were identified,and supplement the identifications with additional compound classifications These preliminary data complemented 
with statistical analysis illustrate a potential of the MS/MSALL approach for high-throughput metabolomics studies where a fast,semi-quantitative 
profiling approach is to be combined with a confidence in compound identity and a potential for identification of unexpected secondary metabolites

Novel visual analytics platforms for multi-omics integration and network visualization
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Guangyan Zhou, McGill University, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Huiting Ou, Guangyan Zhou, Jianguo Xia
Multi-omics integration is emerging as a powerful strategy to simultaneously analyze and interpret multiple datasets from different omics 
technologies It aims at gaining systems-level understanding of different disease states and other experimental conditions by revealing novel 
mechanistic insights of molecular pathways involved There is an urgent need for user-friendly bioinformatics tools dedicated for multi-omics 
network integration and visualization To address these challenges, we are actively developing two web-based platforms - OmicsAnalyst and 
OmicsNet to support statistics-based integration and network-based integration, respectively OmicsAnalyst aims at facilitating the access to 
multivariate methods including O2PLS, Procrustes analysis, multiblock PCA and PLS In addition, it uses advanced visual analytics techniques 
including 3D scatter plot and interactive heatmap, to deconvolute the complex outputs of these methods OmicsNet enables users to create 
and merge different types of biological networks and visualize using an innovative WebGL-based system in 3D space Users can query known 
interactions between seven different types of elements including SNPs, genes/proteins, TFs, miRNAs, metabolites, mass peaks and phenotypes, 
within the context of current knowledge

Matching Untargeted Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry Features Across Multiple Cohorts: Finding the Same 
Needles in Several Haystacks Via Networks
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Rui Climaco Pinto, Imperial College London, United Kingdom

In untargeted metabolomics, accurate within-dataset feature matching is aided by accessing large amounts of chromatographic/spectral information 
in each sample In contrast, when matching features from multiple cohorts/batches that used the same analytical method but were acquired and 
peak-picked separately, only limited information is available - often only retention time and m/z (RT-MZ) medians We propose a new cross-cohort 
matching method which uses the RT-MZ median values of each feature (plus optionally feature intensity and other feature-quality measures) 
Initially matches within manually-defined RT-MZ thresholds between all one-to-one dataset combinations are detected In the next - key - step it 
builds a network of features (nodes) based on those matches (edges) Only matches in subnetworks (connected components) in which all nodes 
are connected to all other nodes (maximal cliques) are accepted, which removes features that matched by chance As some features may present 
multiple matching possibilities, a third step using RT-MZ differences to define a match-quality score is then used to decide the best single matches 
We illustrate the method’s performance by matching thousands of features from large studies of serum samples and inspecting the matching 
accuracy of hundreds of manually annotated metabolites, and by looking at several feature-quality metrics The method is not computationally 
intensive – eg matching 3 cohorts, each with 1000s of features, takes less than a minute on a typical desktop machine The new approach 
addresses a key problem in metabolomics studies and promises to make analysis of large untargeted multi-cohort data sets a viable option

On-demand construction of deep reference libraries and how they improve compound ID
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Michal Raab, HighChem Ltd., Slovakia(Slovak Republic)
CO-AUTHORS: Jakub Mezey, Samuel Benkovič, Melissa Montoya, Tim Stratton, Robert Mistrík
Compound ID through library searching is arguably the leading application in LC/MS, yet it unconditionally relies on the quality and coverage of 
available spectral libraries However, experimental diversity and hard-to-reproduce fragmentation drives the volume of the LC/MS libraries to 
grow disproportionately compared to GC/MS, posing a challenge for data processing, management and searching applications Here we describe 
an integrated pipeline for high-throughput acquisition of reference compounds and semi-supervised curation utilizing dedicated software for 
automated instrument control and scalable modular microservices-based architecture for quality control, curation, annotation and continuous 
delivery of library records This system has been employed to handle the reference standards in the mzCloud library, allowing to expand the 
coverage of unique compounds by 7500 in two months HRAM-MS/MS data was acquired for reference standards by nanoinfusion using an 
automated tool that acquired fragmentation data at increasing NCE (Normalized Collision Energy) levels of 10-200 in increments of 10 Intelligent 
controlling software was deployed for batch-like data dependent MSn acquisition of reference compounds A collection of data processing services 
has been built using a docker-based microservice platform including feature detection/extraction, noise filtering, annotation, fragment prediction 
and mass error correction Additionally, separate quality control services are employed for real-time data inspection A web-based frontend is used 
to monitor and control the processing queue, applying a sequence of the processing services from one of the pre-defined profiles individually for 
each spectral reference dataset, and to provide feedback through quality control indicators

Integrating Polygenic Risk Scores and Metabolite Quantitative Trait Loci to Infer Dysregulated Mechanisms in Rheumatoid 
Arthritis Subtypes in Women
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Su Chu, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Jing Cui, Jeffrey A. Sparks, Bing Lu, Clary Clish, Jessica Lasky-Su, Elizabeth Karlson, Karen Costenbader
Background: Rheumatoid arthritis polygenic risk scores (RA-PRS) improve RA risk prediction, but the added predictive value over clinical variables 
is modest Several human leucocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes are strongly related to seropositive RA, a severe subtype Recently, we identified 
several metabolites associated with RA risk Integrating RA-PRS and metabolomics may provide insight into RA pathogenesis Methods: Plasma 
samples from 254 pre-RA cases in the Nurses’ Health Studies were analyzed using untargeted liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (360 
unique metabolites after quality control) PRS comprised 1) non-HLA 93 single nucleotide variants (PRS93), and 2) HLA haplotypes (HLA-PRS) 
previously associated with RA risk Using ordinary least squares, associations between both PRS93 and HLA-PRS and individual metabolites were 
tested to identify RA-related metabolite quantitative trait loci (metaboQTLs) Interaction models assessed effect modification by RA serostatus 
Results: After multiple comparison adjustment using the pooled local index of significance, no PRS93 metaboQTLs were found; however, 27 
RA HLA-PRS metaboQTLs were identified, including those involved in branched chain amino acid and polyamine metabolism: C2 carnitine 
(β=0120; padj=0018), C3:carnitine (β=0122; padj=0007), C5:1 carnitine (β=0120; padj=0016), 4-acetamidobutanoate (β=0134; padj=0027), and 
N-acetylputrescine (β=0119; padj=0011) Two findings suggesting effect modification of metabolite levels by seropositivity were observed in RA-
HLA metaboQTLs: C5:1 carnitine (p-interaction=0068) and arecaidine (p-interaction=0077) Conclusions: We identified several metaboQTLs of HLA 
haplotypes in pre-RA, but none for PRS93 Evidence to support effect modification of the HLA-PRS and metabolite association by RA serostatus was 
identified for one acylcarnitine and one alkaloid derivative However, further validation is required

Food Metabolome Repository: A database for cross-sample specificity-based peak prioritization in untargeted metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nozomu Sakurai, National Institute of Genetics, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Kunihiro Suda
The substantial issue in mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomics is a lack of information by which we can prioritize the candidate 
peaks for further detailed investigation, rather than the accuracy of metabolite prediction/annotation tools The major bottleneck in untargeted 
metabolomics is an annotation of compound peaks largely due to limited availability of authentic standards for identification A lot of computational 
tools and databases have been developed so far for prediction of metabolites using accurate mass value, pattern of isotopic ions, and MS/MS 
spectra However, the results from most of them are the candidate lists with some evaluation scores and the candidate with the highest score is not 
always true Therefore, we have to investigate the validity of the prediction results one-by-one based on the other information such as literature 
knowledge of the occurrence of the candidate compound in nature However, the occurrence of unknown peaks is not available because of the 
lack of databases by which peaks from a wide variety of samples can be compared and searched To tackle this, we developed Food Metabolome 
Repository (http://metabolitesin/foods) A large variety of compounds is expected in foods because a lot of biological species are included and they 
can be processed by heating and fermenting Untargeted metabolome data obtained from 222 foods using reversed-phase liquid chromatography-
high resolution MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) positive and negative modes are available The searching and acquiring functions can be 
integrated into other computational tools for automatic and large-scale processing via application programming interfaces (APIs)

Toward a high-quality non-targeted analysis of large metabolomics data - Masahiro Sugimoto, Rintaro Saito, Tomoyoshi Soga, Masaru Tomita, Toru 
Takebayashi Metabolomics cohort studies are becoming more widespread Data processing and correcting data to remove unexpected biases 
are important for quality controls (QCs) We have conducted the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study enrolling 11,002 community-dwelling adults 
in Japan Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) has been used for the identification and quantification of hydrophilic metabolites 
in human plasma Here we developed processing tools to analyze these data First, we have developed MasterHands, a Java-based GUI software 
which is capable of versatile data analysis of CE-MS data We upgraded this software to have an application programmable interface for Python 
language We prepared two types of programs, one for non-targeted and the other for targeted analyses Firstly, we conducted a non-targeted 
analysis of QC sample and analysts conducted curation of analyzed data in order to optimize analytical parameters for individual peaks The 
characteristics of curated peaks were used for training data for the subsequent analysis The other samples were analyzed using targeted analysis 
program and the curation of each peak integration are automatically adjusted following to the training data These two-step analyses enable high-
quality data processing even in the large scale datasets Here, we show the algorithm and the performance of the processed data

A genome-wide association study of circulating plasma metabolite levels identifies differences by sex and suggests that 
metabolites represent polygenic traits

Eliassen, Peter Kraft
Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with disease risk but 
the mechanisms driving these associations remain largely unknown Understanding the effects of SNPs on the metabolome of healthy individuals 
may elucidate the mechanisms linking SNPs to disease We performed a GWAS of circulating plasma metabolomics (metaboQTLs) in 4390 
participants of Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), NHS II and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) We also performed a genome-wide screen 
for metaboQTLs showing differences by sex Methods: Linear regression of metabolite levels and genotype, adjusted for age, cohort, fasting status 
and the first four genotype principal components was used to identify metaboQTLs Cochran’s Q-test was used to identify metaboQTLs showing 
heterogeneity by sex Results: Seventy-four metabolites were associated with 93 independent SNPs (p<23E-10) Individual SNPs were associated 
with 1-21 metabolites and individual metabolites with 1-6 SNPs The top identified metaboQTL (p=537E-248) was between a SNP next to carbamoyl-
phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) and glycine CPS1 encodes an enzyme known to directly modify glycine Fifteen of the 93 independent SNPs represent 
new metaboQTLs (LDr2<05 with published metaboQTLs) Twenty-three metaboQTLs showed genome-wide significant heterogeneity by sex The 
metaboQTL of a SNP on the gene fatty acids dehydrogenase 2 (FADS2) and cholesteryl ester C20:4 showed strongest evidence for sex differences 
(p=491E-39) Conclusion: Multiple SNPs were associated with circulating metabolite levels We identified new associations and also validated 
previously published results Several metaboQTLs showed heterogeneity by sex Some metabolites were associated with multiple variants, 
suggesting that metabolites may represent polygenic traits

MsCompare: An Untargeted GC/MS Metabolomics Platform for Quality Control, Precise Deconvolution and Data Analysis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Marco Ruijken, MsMetrix, Netherlands
A GC/MS workflow for Metabolomics includes a number of distinct steps: Experimental Design, Sampling, Sample Preparation, Data Analysis, 
Identification and Data Interpretation The MsCompare platform includes all tools to properly control each step in this workflow One of the key 
issues in this field is the precise and sensitive detection of all components present in a series of samples GC/MS deconvolution remains by far 
the most difficult step for low level components, especially when highly similar co-eluting or nearly co-eluting compounds are present In these 
cases, precise GC/MS Peak Detection and Deconvolution is necessary with minimal user interference Proper deconvolution also allows for correct 
identification of all components Another problematic area in GC/MS Metabolomics studies might be the proper alignment of chromatograms 
before the actual data processing starts Depending on the application, we often see individual components in GC/MS having bad peaks shapes or 
bad reproducibility regarding retention times MsCompare contains a number of alignment algorithms to correct for this behavior Data analysis in 
MsCompare comprises both Univariate and Multivariate analysis methods like PCA, PLS-DA, Clustering etc However, it will be shown that for many 
cases, due to the high selectivity of GC/MS, univariate analysis methods are adequate in solving the main questions Examples from a number of 
different studies (small and large) will be given, showing an overview of the workflow and implemented tools

A statistical approach to classification of mechanistic computational models of Parkinson’s Disease
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lalithasushma Chakravadhanula, LIACS, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Agnieszka Wegrzyn, German Preciat, Alissa Schurink, Edinson Lucumi, Michael Emmerich, Ronan M.T. Fleming
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder It is the second most common disease that affects the central nervous 
system and affects 7-10 million people worldwide PD manifests with both motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and non-motor symptoms 
like depression and fatigue Although the pathogenesis of PD remains a puzzle, several genetic and environmental factors are known to affect 
the progression of the disease This project focuses on the discovery of changes in metabolism due to the PINK1 gene mutation PINK1 is a 
mitochondrially targeted, serine/threonine protein kinase PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) that protects cells from stress-induced mitochondrial 
dysfunction We compare the effects of mitochondria-targeting inhibitors in patient and gene-corrected PINK1-Q456X cells, with healthy controls 
Our data was generated from in vitro cultures of patient-derived human neuroepithelial stem cells, that were differentiated into dopaminergic 
neurons A generic human genome-scale metabolic model was used to create a dopaminergic neuron-specific metabolic model The steady-
state solution spaces of constraint-based models of metabolism, in patient and gene-corrected PINK1-Q456X cells, were sampled and the flux 
distributions for each reaction were compared Individual flux distributions may be diverse (uniform, normal, truncated, etc), posing a challenge 
in statistical analysis To address this issue, we developed an algorithm that classifies diverse flux distributions and highlights dissimilarities Our 
approach allows us to study the differences in the uptake and secretion rates between the patient, gene-corrected, and healthy control models 
Thereby, leading to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PINK1-PD

Extended Quality Control for Biocrates’ Targeted Metabolomics Kits
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mathias Kuhring, Max Delbrück Center (MDC) for Molecular Medicine, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Alina Eisenberger, Raphaela Fritsche, Yoann Gloaguen, Dieter Beule, Jennifer Kirwan
Targeted mass spectrometry profiling methods optimized and validated for defined metabolites enable comprehensive routine metabolomics 
applications such as the analysis of larger cohorts However, comprehensive studies require consistent processing and reliable instrumentation 
to minimize technical variance and interference Consequently, multiple and reproducible controls are required to verify data quality While 
standardized methods such as the Targeted Metabolomics Kits of Biocrates promise consistent and comparable measurements, they are not fully 
resistant to external influences These include sample handling and processing errors, contamination, sample carryover, batch effects, intra-batch 
drift, edge effects, missing values of unknown origin and instrument condition Here, we present an extensive quality control procedure for targeted 
data acquired using Biocrates kits designed to be complementary to the Biocrates MetIDQ software Based on MetIDQ outputs, it combines 
several visualizations into a comprehensive HTML report using an R Notebook These include, for instance, visualizations of measured and missing 
values, of positional irregularities with respect to acquisition sequence or well plate coordinates as well as of sample and metabolite variability and 
reproducibility The tool supports Biocrates’ AbsoluteIDQ® p400 HR Kit and MxP® Quant 500 Kit, however, most features apply to other Biocrates 
kits exportable by MetIDQ, with possible future extension to generic targeted metabolomics data Overall, the report aids in either verifying data 
consistency and quality or, if necessary, in identifying pattern of interference as well as removing low quality samples or metabolites, thereby 
increasing confidence in data and subsequent analysis An R package will be made available under a permissive license

A novel algorithm to improve NMR alignment of urine metabolomics data by spectral reordering and ridge tracing
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sicong Zhang, The University of Georgia, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Arthur S. Edison
In Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the chemical shifts of some resonances are sensitive to sample properties, such as pH, salt 
concentration, temperature, and other matrix effects This phenomenon challenges feature annotation and chemometric analysis in metabolomics 
research, leading to the necessity of data alignment processing steps Urine is a widely used sample type in NMR metabolomics because of 
its simplicity in sample preparation and rich data However, urine NMR samples are difficult to buffer and lead to large chemical shift variations 
Although different alignment algorithms have been developed, none of them perfectly solve this problem Here we present a new algorithm to 
improve urine NMR spectra alignment, by reordering the spectra according to the chemical shift of an internal peak then tracing responding peaks 
We utilized DBSCAN-clustering to exclude mis-traced peaks, then used confidence intervals of traced peaks to find missed peaks All traced 
peaks were aligned and placed at the end of the original spectra for further analysis Two human urine datasets were used here for algorithm 
development Significant improvement of peak alignment and STOCSY performance were observed using this algorithm We will next compare 
results from this algorithm with other urine NMR analysis and alignment approaches This work is expected to be generally useful for NMR 
processing to improve the accuracy and coverage of urine metabolomics studies
