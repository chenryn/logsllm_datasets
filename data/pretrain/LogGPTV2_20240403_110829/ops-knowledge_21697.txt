User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How does one go about network forensics investigation with no prior knowledge? I am being asked to perform a forensics investigation on a network.
The reason being that for the past few months strange things are happening on the network. VLANs are being deleted, configuration changes are being made, and all sorts of modifications are occurring on the network devices. IT ranges from the Firewalls, through the SSL VPN device and all up to the switches. The system administrators are feeling like they are being toyed with, and I was asked to see if I can find anything (this hasn't been labeled a real "forensics investigation" since I am no forensics investigator, but was simply asked to give me best effort on this).

The question is, how do I go about it?
Does it all just come up to collecting the logs and looking for events around the time that the company felt the changes?
Is there any basic methodology "for-dummies"?
Is this sort of investigation an easy task or is it tedious and boring, time-consuming effort?

Assistant: OK. I promise I'm not trying to be mean about this. 

To paraphrase the question: how do I go about performing forensics with no prior experience?

You don't. Seriously. There are dummies books available that will touch on the basics and there are a number of websites that will walk you through common situations but to perform any defensible forensic analysis you will need the proper training and documentation. 

To the point of 'this hasn't been labeled a real "forensics investigation"'; maybe it hasn't, but it could and there is a very real possibility that you could alter evidential data in your analysis. Should this become a 'real' investigation you might find yourself in a bad situation. 

-IF- you get it in writing that this is not ever ever ever going to move toward a legal issue, with complete indemnity for you, then grab a copy of Computer Forensics for Dummies and have a ball.
