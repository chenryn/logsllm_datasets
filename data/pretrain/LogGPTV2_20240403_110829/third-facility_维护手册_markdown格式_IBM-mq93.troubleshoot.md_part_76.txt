### 2. Locate and Copy the Most Recent Archive Log Data Set
- **Step 1:** Identify the BSDS (Basic System Data Set) associated with the most recent archive log data set.
- **Step 2:** Copy this BSDS to the replacement data set.

### 3. Print the Contents of the Replacement BSDS
- **Step 1:** Use the print log map utility to display the contents of the replacement BSDS.

### 4. Generate a Summary Report of Missing Active Log Data Sets
- **Step 1:** Use the print log records utility to generate a summary report of the active log data sets that are missing from the replacement BSDS.
- **Step 2:** Establish the RBA (Relative Byte Address) range for these missing data sets.

### 5. Update the Missing Active Log Data Set Inventory
- **Step 1:** Use the change log inventory utility to update the inventory of missing active log data sets in the replacement BSDS.

### 6. Copy the Updated BSDS to the Second Copy (if Dual BSDS is Used)
- **Step 1:** If dual BSDS data sets are in use, copy the updated BSDS to the second copy of the BSDS.

### 7. Restart the Queue Manager
- **Step 1:** Restart the queue manager.

### Operator Action
- **None.**

### Unequal Time Stamps
#### Symptoms
- IBM MQ issues the following message:
  ```
  CSQJ120E +CSQ1 DUAL BSDS DATA SETS HAVE UNEQUAL TIME STAMPS,
  SYSTEM BSDS1=...,BSDS2=...,
  UTILITY BSDS1=...,BSDS2=...
  ```

#### Possible Causes
- One copy of the BSDS has been restored, and all information about the restored BSDS is down-level. The down-level BSDS has the earlier time stamp.
- One of the volumes containing the BSDS has been restored, and all information about the restored volume is down-level. If the volume contains any active log data sets or IBM MQ data, they are also down-level. The down-level volume has the earlier time stamp.
- Dual logging has degraded to single logging, and you are trying to start without recovering the damaged log.
- The queue manager terminated abnormally after updating one copy of the BSDS but before updating the second copy.

#### System Action
- IBM MQ attempts to resynchronize the BSDS data sets using the more recent copy. If this fails, queue manager startup is terminated.

#### System Programmer Action
- **None.**

#### Operator Action
- If automatic resynchronization fails, follow these steps:
  1. Run the print log map utility on both copies of the BSDS and compare the lists to determine which copy is accurate or current.
  2. Rename the down-level data set and define a replacement for it.
  3. Copy the good data set to the replacement data set using Access Method Services.
  4. If applicable, determine whether the volume containing the down-level BSDS has been restored. If it has been restored, all data on that volume, such as the active log data, is also down-level. If the restored volume contains active log data and you were using dual active logs on separate volumes, you need to copy the current version of the active log to the down-level log data set. See "Recovering Logs" for details.

### Out of Synchronization
#### Symptoms
- IBM MQ issues the following message during queue manager initialization:
  ```
  CSQJ122E +CSQ1 DUAL BSDS DATA SETS ARE OUT OF SYNCHRONIZATION
  ```

#### Cause
- The two input copies of the BSDSs have different time stamps or contain inconsistent records. This can occur if operator errors occurred while the change log inventory utility was being used, or if the queue manager terminated abnormally prior to the BSDS conversion utility being run.

#### System Action
- Queue manager startup or the utility is terminated.

#### System Programmer Action
- **None.**

#### Operator Action
- If the error occurred during queue manager initialization, follow these steps:
  1. Run the print log map utility on both copies of the BSDS and compare the lists to determine which copy is accurate or current.
  2. Rename the data set that had the problem and define a replacement for it.
  3. Copy the accurate data set to the replacement data set using access method services.
  4. Restart the queue manager.
- If the error occurred when running the BSDS conversion utility, follow these steps:
  1. Attempt to restart the queue manager and shut it down cleanly before attempting to run the BSDS conversion utility again.
  2. If this does not solve the problem, run the print log map utility on both copies of the BSDS and compare the lists to determine which copy is accurate or current.
  3. Change the JCL used to invoke the BSDS conversion utility to specify the current BSDS in the SYSUT1 DD statement and remove the SYSUT2 DD statement before submitting the job again.

### I/O Error
#### Symptoms
- IBM MQ changes to single BSDS mode and issues the user message:
  ```
  CSQJ126E +CSQ1 BSDS ERROR FORCED SINGLE BSDS MODE
  ```
- This is followed by one of the following messages:
  - `CSQJ107E +CSQ1 READ ERROR ON BSDS`
  - `CSQJ108E +CSQ1 WRITE ERROR ON BSDS`

#### System Action
- The BSDS mode changes from dual to single. If the error code for message CSQJ107E or CSQJ108E is unexpected, a diagnostic dump might be taken.

#### System Programmer Action
- **None.**

#### Operator Action
- Follow these steps:
  1. Use Access Method Services to rename or delete the damaged BSDS and define a new BSDS with the same name as the BSDS that had the error. Example control statements can be found in job CSQ4BREC in thlqual.SCSQPROC.
  2. Issue the IBM MQ command `RECOVER BSDS` to make a copy of the good BSDS in the newly allocated data set and reinstate dual BSDS mode. See "Recovering the BSDS" for more details.

### Log Range Problems
#### Symptoms
- IBM MQ has issued one of the following messages:
  - `CSQJ113E` when reading its own log.
  - `CSQJ133E` or `CSQJ134E` when reading the log of a queue manager in the queue sharing group.

#### System Action
- Depending on what log record is being read and why, the requestor might end abnormally with a reason code of X'00D1032A'.

#### System Programmer Action
- Run the print log map utility (CSQJU004) to determine the cause of the error. When message CSQJ133E or CSQJ134E has been issued, run the utility against the BSDS of the queue manager indicated in the message.

#### Operator Action
- If you have:
  - Deleted the entry with the log range (containing the log RBA or LRSN indicated in the message) from the BSDS.
  - Not deleted or reused the data set.
- You can add the entry back into the BSDS using the following procedure:
  1. Identify the data set containing the required RBA or LRSN by looking at an old copy of the contents of BSDS or by running CSQJU004 against a backup of the BSDS.
  2. Add the data set back into the BSDS using the change log inventory utility (CSQJU003).
  3. Restart the queue manager.

- If an archive log data set has been deleted, you will not be able to recover the page set or CF structure that needs the archive logs. Identify the reason that the queue manager needs to read the log record, then take one of the following actions depending on the page set or CF structure affected.

### Page Sets
#### Message CSQJ113E During Recovery
- **Symptom:** Indicates that the log is needed to perform media recovery to bring a page set up to date.
- **Action:**
  - Identify the page sets that need the deleted log data set for media recovery by looking at the media recovery RBA in the CSQI1049I message issued for each page set during queue manager restart.
  - For **Page Set Zero:**
    - **Attention:** All data in all other page sets will be lost when you carry out the procedure.
    - **Steps:**
      1. Use function SDEFS of the CSQUTIL utility to produce a file of IBM MQ DEFINE commands.
      2. Format page set zero using CSQUTIL, then redefine the other page sets as described in the next section.
      3. Restart the queue manager.
      4. Use CSQUTIL to redefine the objects using the DEFINE commands produced by the utility in step 1.
  - For **Page Sets 1-99:**
    - **Attention:** Any data on the page set is lost when you carry out this operation.
    - **Steps:**
      1. If you can access the page set without any I/O errors, reformat the page set using the CSQUTIL utility with the command `FORMAT TYPE(NEW)`.
      2. If I/O errors occurred when accessing the page set, delete the page set and re-create it. If you want the page set to be the same size as before, use the command `LISTCAT ENT(dsname) ALLOC` to obtain the existing space allocations and use these in the z/OS DEFINE CLUSTER command. Format the new page set using the CSQUTIL utility with the command `FORMAT TYPE(NEW)`.
      3. Restart the queue manager. You might have to take certain actions, such as resetting channels or resolving indoubt channels.

### CF Structures
#### Messages CSQJ113E, CSQJ133E, or CSQJ134E During Recovery
- **Symptom:** Indicates that the logs needed to recover the structure are not available on at least one member of the queue sharing group.
- **Action:**
  - **Application CF Structure:**
    - Issue the command `RECOVER CFSTRUCT(structure-name) TYPE(PURGE)`. This process empties the structure, so any messages on the structure are lost.
  - **CSQSYSAPPL Structure:**
    - Contact your IBM support center.
  - **Administration Structure:**
    - This structure is rebuilt using log data since the last checkpoint on each queue manager, which should be in active logs. If you get this error during administration structure recovery, contact your IBM support center as this indicates that the active log is not available.

- Once you have recovered the page set or CF structure, perform a backup of the logs, BSDS, page sets, and CF structures.
- To prevent this problem from occurring again, increase the:
  - Archive log retention (ARCRETN) value to be longer.
  - Frequency of the CF structure backups.

### Recovering a CF Structure
- **Conceptual Overview:**
  - The data from the previously backed-up CF structure is read from the IBM MQ log; the log is read forwards from the backup and any changes are reapplied to the restored structure.
- **Log Range:**
  - The log range to use is found from the latest backup of each structure to the current time. The log range is identified by log range sequence number (LRSN) values.
  - A LRSN uses the six most significant digits of a 'store clock value'.
  - Note that the whole log (back to the time the structure was created) is read if you have not done a backup of the structure.

- **Procedure:**
  1. Check that the logs from each queue manager in the queue sharing group (QSG) are read for records in this LSRN range. Note that the logs are read backwards.
  2. Check that a list of changes for each structure to be recovered is built.
  3. Data from the coupling facility (CF) structure backup is read and the data is restored.
  4. Processing continues for each structure being restored.

- **Example:**
  - In the following example, the command `RECOVER CFSTRUCT(APP3)` has been issued, and the following messages produced:
    - `04:00:00 CSQE132I CDL2 CSQERRPB Structure recovery started, using log range from LRSN=CC56D01026CC to LRSN=CC56DC368924`
    - `04:02:00 CSQE133I CDL2 CSQERPLS Structure recovery reading log backwards, LRSN=CC56D0414372`
    - `04:02:22 CSQE134I CDL2 CSQERRPB Structure recovery reading log completed`
    - `04:02:22 CSQE130I CDL2 CSQERCF2 Recovery of structure APP3 started, using CDL1 log range from RBA=000EE86D902E to RBA=000EF5E8E4DC`
    - `04:02:29 CSQE131I CDL2 CSQERCF2 Recovery of structure APP3 completed`

### Page Set Problems
- **Use this topic to investigate and resolve problems with the page sets.**
- **This topic covers the problems that you might encounter with page sets:**
  - **Page Set I/O Errors:**
    - **Problem:** A page set has an I/O error.
    - **Symptoms:** This message is issued: `CSQP004E +CSQ1 csect-name I/O ERROR STATUS ret-code PSID psid RBA rba`
    - **System Action:** The queue manager terminates abnormally.
    - **Operator Action:**
      - Repair the I/O error cause.
      - If none of the page sets are damaged, restart the queue manager. IBM MQ automatically restores the page set to a consistent state from the logs.
      - If one or more page sets are damaged:
        1. Rename the damaged page sets and define replacement page sets.
        2. Copy the most recent backup page sets to the replacement page sets.
        3. Restart the queue manager. IBM MQ automatically applies any updates that are necessary from the logs.
      - You cannot restart the queue manager if page set zero is not available. If one of the other page sets is not available, you can comment out the page set DD statement in the queue manager start-up JCL procedure. This lets you defer recovery of the defective page set, enabling other users to continue accessing IBM MQ.
      - When you add the page set back to the JCL procedure, system restart reads the log from the point where the page set was removed from the JCL to the end of the log. This procedure might take a long time if a large amount of data has been logged.
      - A reason code of `MQRC_PAGESET_ERROR` is returned to any application that tries to access a queue defined on a page set that is not available.
      - When you have restored the defective page set, restore its associated DD statement and restart the queue manager.
      - The operator actions described here are only possible if all log data sets are available. If your log data sets are lost or damaged, see "Restarting if you have lost your log data sets."

  - **Page Set Full:**
    - **Problem:** There is not enough space on a page set for one of the following:
      - `MQPUT` or `MQPUT1` calls to be completed.
      - Object manipulation commands to be completed (e.g., `DEFINE QLOCAL`).
      - `MQOPEN` calls for dynamic queues to be completed.
    - **Symptoms:** The request fails with reason code `MQRC_STORAGE_MEDIUM_FULL`. The queue manager cannot complete the request because there is not enough space remaining on the page set.
    - **Cause:** This can occur even when the page set expand attribute is set to `EXPAND(USER)`. Before the reason code `MQRC_STORAGE_MEDIUM_FULL` is returned to the application code, the queue manager will attempt to expand the page set and retry the API request. On a heavily loaded system, it is possible that the expanded storage can be used by other IO operations before the retry of the API. See "Managing page sets."
    - **System Action:** Further requests that use this page set are blocked until enough messages are removed or objects deleted to make room for the new incoming requests.
    - **Operator Action:**
      - Use the IBM MQ command `DISPLAY USAGE PSID(*)` to identify which page set is full.
    - **System Programmer Action:**
      - You can either enlarge the page set involved or reduce the loading on that page set by moving queues to another page set. See "Managing page sets" for more information about these tasks. If the cause of the problem is messages accumulating on the transmission queue, consider starting distributed queuing to transmit the messages.

### Coupling Facility and Db2 Problems
- **Use this topic to investigate and resolve problems with the coupling facility and Db2.**
- **This section covers the problems that you might encounter with the coupling facility and Db2:**
  - **Storage Medium Full:**
    - **Problem:** A coupling facility structure is full.
    - **Symptoms:** IBM MQ issues the following message:
      ```
      CSQJ126E +CSQ1 BSDS ERROR FORCED SINGLE BSDS MODE
      ```
