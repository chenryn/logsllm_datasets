2.Locate the BSDS associated with the most recent archive log data set, and copy it to the
replacement data set.
3.Use the print log map utility to print the contents of the replacement BSDS.
4.Use the print log records utility to print a summary report of the active log data sets missing from
the replacement BSDS, and to establish the RBA range.
5.Use the change log inventory utility to update the missing active log data set inventory in the
replacement BSDS.
6.If dual BSDS data sets had been in use, copy the updated BSDS to the second copy of the BSDS.
7.Restart the queue manager.
Operator action
None.
Unequal time stamps
Symptoms
IBM MQ issues the following message:
CSQJ120E +CSQ1 DUAL BSDS DATA SETS HAVE UNEQUAL TIME STAMPS,
SYSTEM BSDS1=...,BSDS2=...,
UTILITY BSDS1=...,BSDS2=...
The possible causes are:
• One copy of the BSDS has been restored. All information about the restored BSDS is down-level.
The down-level BSDS has the earlier time stamp.
• One of the volumes containing the BSDS has been restored. All information about the restored
volume is down-level. If the volume contains any active log data sets or IBM MQ data, they are also
down-level. The down-level volume has the earlier time stamp.
• Dual logging has degraded to single logging, and you are trying to start without recovering the
damaged log.
• The queue manager terminated abnormally after updating one copy of the BSDS but before
updating the second copy.
System action
IBM MQ attempts to resynchronize the BSDS data sets using the more recent copy. If this fails, queue
manager startup is terminated.
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 489
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
If automatic resynchronization fails, carry out these steps:
1.Run the print log map utility on both copies of the BSDS, compare the lists to determine which
copy is accurate or current.
2.Rename the down-level data set and define a replacement for it.
3.Copy the good data set to the replacement data set, using Access Method Services.
4.If applicable, determine whether the volume containing the down-level BSDS has been restored. If
it has been restored, all data on that volume, such as the active log data, is also down-level.
If the restored volume contains active log data and you were using dual active logs on separate
volumes, you need to copy the current version of the active log to the down-level log data set. See
Recovering logs for details of how to do this.
Out of synchronization
Symptoms
IBM MQ issues the following message during queue manager initialization:
CSQJ122E +CSQ1 DUAL BSDS DATA SETS ARE OUT OF SYNCHRONIZATION
The two input copies of the BSDSs have different time stamps, or contain a record that is inconsistent.
Differences can exist if operator errors occurred while the change log inventory utility was being used.
(For example, the change log inventory utility was only run on one copy.) The change log inventory
utility sets a private time stamp in the BSDS control record when it starts, and a close flag when it
ends. IBM MQ checks the change log inventory utility time stamps and, if they are different, or they
are the same but one close flag is not set, IBM MQ compares the copies of the BSDSs. If the copies
are different, message CSQJ122E is issued.
This message is also issued by the BSDS conversion utility if two input BSDS are specified and a
record is found that differs between the two BSDS copies. This situation can arise if the queue
manager terminated abnormally prior to the BSDS conversion utility being run.
System action
Queue manager startup or the utility is terminated.
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
If the error occurred during queue manager initialization, carry out these steps:
1.Run the print log map utility on both copies of the BSDS, and compare the lists to determine which
copy is accurate or current.
2.Rename the data set that had the problem, and define a replacement for it.
3.Copy the accurate data set to the replacement data set, using access method services.
4.Restart the queue manager.
If the error occurred when running the BSDS conversion utility, carry out these steps:
1.Attempt to restart the queue manager and shut it down cleanly before attempting to run the BSDS
conversion utility again.
2.If this does not solve the problem, run the print log map utility on both copies of the BSDS, and
compare the lists to determine which copy is accurate or current.
490 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
3.Change the JCL used to invoke the BSDS conversion utility to specify the current BSDS in the
SYSUT1 DD statement, and remove the SYSUT2 DD statement, before submitting the job again.
I/O error
Symptoms
IBM MQ changes to single BSDS mode and issues the user message:
CSQJ126E +CSQ1 BSDS ERROR FORCED SINGLE BSDS MODE
This is followed by one of the following messages:
CSQJ107E +CSQ1 READ ERROR ON BSDS
DSNAME=... ERROR STATUS=...
CSQJ108E +CSQ1 WRITE ERROR ON BSDS
DSNAME=... ERROR STATUS=...
System action
The BSDS mode changes from dual to single.
If the error code for message CSQJ107E or CSQJ108E is unexpected, a diagnostic dump might be
taken.
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
Carry out these steps:
1.Use Access Method Services to rename or delete the damaged BSDS and to define a new BSDS
with the same name as the BSDS that had the error. Example control statements can be found in
job CSQ4BREC in thlqual.SCSQPROC.
2.Issue the IBM MQ command RECOVER BSDS to make a copy of the good BSDS in the newly
allocated data set and reinstate dual BSDS mode. See also Recovering the BSDS.
Log range problems
Symptoms
IBM MQ has issued message CSQJ113E when reading its own log, or message CSQJ133E or CSQJ134E
when reading the log of a queue manager in the queue sharing group. This can happen when you do not
have the archive logs needed to restart the queue manager or recover a CF structure.
System action
Depending upon what log record is being read and why, the requestor might end abnormally with a reason
code of X'00D1032A'.
System programmer action
Run the print log map utility (CSQJU004) to determine the cause of the error. When message CSQJ133E
or CSQJ134E has been issued, run the utility against the BSDS of the queue manager indicated in the
message.
If you have:
• Deleted the entry with the log range (containing the log RBA or LRSN indicated in the message) from the
BSDS, and
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 491
• Not deleted or reused the data set
you can add the entry back into the BSDS using the following procedure:
1.Identify the data set containing the required RBA or LRSN, by looking at an old copy of the contents of
BSDS, or by running CSQJU004 against a backup of the BSDS.
2.Add the data set back into the BSDS using the change log inventory utility (CSQJU003).
3.Restart the queue manager.
If an archive log data set has been deleted, you will not be able to recover the page set or CF structure
that needs the archive logs. Identify the reason that the queue manager needs to read the log record,
then take one of the following actions depending on the page set or CF structure affected.
Page sets
Message CSQJ113E during the recovery phase of queue manager restart indicates that the log is needed
to perform media recovery to bring a page set up to date.
Identify the page sets that need the deleted log data set for media recovery, by looking at the media
recovery RBA in the CSQI1049I message issued for each page set during queue manager restart, then
perform the following actions.
• Page set zero
You can recover the objects on page set zero, by using the following procedure.
Attention: All data in all other page sets will be lost when you carry out the procedure.
1.Use function SDEFS of the CSQUTIL utility to produce a file of IBM MQ DEFINE commands.
2.Format page set zero using CSQUTIL, then redefine the other page sets as described in the next
section.
3.Restart the queue manager.
4.Use CSQUTIL to redefine the objects using the DEFINE commands produced by the utility in step 1.
• Page sets 1-99
Use the following procedure to redefine the page sets.
Attention: Any data on the page set is lost when you carry out this operation.
1.If you can access the page set without any I/O errors, reformat the page set using the CSQUTIL
utility with the command FORMAT TYPE(NEW).
2.If I/O errors occurred when accessing the page set, delete the page set and re-create it.
If you want the page set to be the same size as before, use the command LISTCAT ENT(dsname)
ALLOC to obtain the existing space allocations, and use these in the z/OS DEFINE CLUSTER
command.
Format the new page set using the CSQUTIL utility with the command FORMAT TYPE(NEW).
3.Restart the queue manager. You might have to take certain actions, such as resetting channels or
resolving indoubt channels.
CF structures
Messages CSQJ113E, CSQJ133E, or CSQJ134E, during the recovery of a CF structure, indicate that the
logs needed to recover the structure are not available on at least one member of the queue sharing group.
Take one of the following actions depending on the structure affected:
Application CF structure
Issue the command RECOVER CFSTRUCT(structure-name) TYPE(PURGE).
This process empties the structure, so any messages on the structure are lost.
492 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
CSQSYSAPPL structure
Contact your IBM support center.
Administration structure
This structure is rebuilt using log data since the last checkpoint on each queue manager, which should
be in active logs.
If you get this error during administration structure recovery, contact your IBM support center as this
indicates that the active log is not available.
Once you have recovered the page set or CF structure, perform a backup of the logs, BSDS, page sets, and
CF structures.
To prevent this problem from occurring again, increase the:
• Archive log retention (ARCRETN) value to be longer, and
• Increase the frequency of the CF structure backups.
Recovering a CF structure
Conceptually, the data from the previously backed up CF structure is read from the IBM MQ log; the log is
read forwards from the backup and any changes are reapplied to the restored structure.
About this task
The log range to use is found from the latest backup of each structure to be recovered, to the current time.
The log range is identified by log range sequence number (LRSN) values.
A LRSN uses the six most significant digits of a 'store clock value'.
Note that the whole log (back to the time the structure was created) is read, if you have not done a backup
of the structure.
Procedure
1.Check that the logs from each queue manager in the queue sharing group (QSG) are read for records in
this LSRN range.
Note that the logs are read backwards.
2.Check that a list of changes for each structure to be recovered is built.
3.Data from the coupling facility (CF) structure backup is read and the data is restored.
For example, if the backup was done on queue manager A, and the recovery is running on queue
manager B, queue manager B reads the logs from queue manager A to restore the structure.
When the start of the backup of the CF structure is read, an internal task is started to take the restored
data for the structure and merge it with the changes read from the log.
4.Check that processing continues for each structure being restored.
Example
In the following example, the command RECOVER CFSTRUCT(APP3) has been issued, and the following
messages produced:
04:00:00 CSQE132I CDL2 CSQERRPB Structure recovery started, using log range from
LRSN=CC56D01026CC
to LRSN=CC56DC368924
This is the start of reading the logs backwards from each qmgr in the queue sharing group from
the time
of failure to the to the structure backup. The LRSN values give the ranges being used.
Log records for all structures (just one structure in this example) being recovered are
processed at the same time.
04:02:00 CSQE133I CDL2 CSQERPLS Structure recovery reading log backwards, LRSN=CC56D0414372
This message is produced periodically to show the process
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 493
04:02:22 CSQE134I CDL2 CSQERRPB Structure recovery reading log completed
The above process of replaying the logs backwards has finished,
04:02:22 CSQE130I CDL2 CSQERCF2 Recovery of structure APP3 started, using CDL1 log range
from RBA=000EE86D902E to RBA=000EF5E8E4DC
The task to process the data for APP3 has been started. The last backup of CF structure
APP3 was done on CDL1 within the given RBA range, so this log range has to be read.
04:02:29 CSQE131I CDL2 CSQERCF2 Recovery of structure APP3 completed
The data merge has completed. The structure is recovered.
Page set problems
Use this topic to investigate, and resolve problems with the page sets.
This topic covers the problems that you might encounter with page sets:
• “Page set I/O errors” on page 494 describes what happens if a page set is damaged.
• “Page set full” on page 495 describes what happens if there is not enough space on the page set for any
more MQI operations.
Page set I/O errors
Problem
A page set has an I/O error.
Symptoms
This message is issued:
CSQP004E +CSQ1 csect-name I/O ERROR STATUS ret-code
PSID psid RBA rba
System action
The queue manager terminates abnormally.
System programmer action
None.
Operator action
Repair the I/O error cause.
If none of the page sets are damaged, restart the queue manager. IBM MQ automatically restores the
page set to a consistent state from the logs.
If one or more page sets are damaged:
1.Rename the damaged page sets and define replacement page sets.
2.Copy the most recent backup page sets to the replacement page sets.
3.Restart the queue manager. IBM MQ automatically applies any updates that are necessary from
the logs.
You cannot restart the queue manager if page set zero is not available. If one of the other page sets
is not available, you can comment out the page set DD statement in the queue manager start-up JCL
procedure. This lets you defer recovery of the defective page set, enabling other users to continue
accessing IBM MQ.
When you add the page set back to the JCL procedure, system restart reads the log from the point
where the page set was removed from the JCL to the end of the log. This procedure might take a
long time if a large amount of data has been logged.
494 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
A reason code of MQRC_PAGESET_ERROR is returned to any application that tries to access a queue
defined on a page set that is not available.
When you have restored the defective page set, restore its associated DD statement and restart the
queue manager.
The operator actions described here are only possible if all log data sets are available. If your log data sets
are lost or damaged, see Restarting if you have lost your log data sets.
Page set full
Problem
There is not enough space on a page set for one of the following:
• MQPUT or MQPUT1 calls to be completed
• Object manipulation commands to be completed (for example, DEFINE QLOCAL)
• MQOPEN calls for dynamic queues to be completed
Symptoms
The request fails with reason code MQRC_STORAGE_MEDIUM_FULL. The queue manager cannot
complete the request because there is not enough space remaining on the page set.
Reason code MQRC_STORAGE_MEDIUM_FULL can occur even when the page set expand attribute
is set to EXPAND(USER). Before the reason code MQRC_STORAGE_MEDIUM_FULL is returned to
the application code, the queue manager will attempt to expand the page set and retry the API
request. On a heavily loaded system it is possible that the expanded storage can be used by other IO
operations before the retry of the API. See Managing page sets.
The cause of this problem could be messages accumulating on a transmission queue because they
cannot be sent to another system.
System action
Further requests that use this page set are blocked until enough messages are removed or objects
deleted to make room for the new incoming requests.
Operator action
Use the IBM MQ command DISPLAY USAGE PSID(*) to identify which page set is full.
System programmer action
You can either enlarge the page set involved or reduce the loading on that page set by moving queues
to another page set. See Managing page sets for more information about these tasks. If the cause
of the problem is messages accumulating on the transmission queue, consider starting distributed
queuing to transmit the messages.
