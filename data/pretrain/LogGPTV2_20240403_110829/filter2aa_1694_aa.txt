Introduction to
Species, Lost in Apple-eating Time
I have to admit, I love this wee little story. It’s the best I could do
at the time, trying to express the unthinkable in words.
It was the unthinkable, I think, that I was thinking, walking
around the park near which I live in Fox Point, Wisconsin, thinking,
just thinking. Sometimes I think aloud and sometimes I practice
speeches as I walk, and I look pretty wild to those who don’t, don’t
walk and talk and think with single-minded intensity, focused on
what’s inside, oblivious to and not caring how it looks.
Once a young person knows that the meaningful compass is
inside, they pretty much own themselves (of course, that inside self
is formed in and by a community, we are social animals after all, and
the communities we choose do matter, as I often said, preaching to
the faithful (more or less) on Sunday mornings).
But I digress. This is no place for exploring paradoxical complex-
ities.... or maybe it is, since the walls of a self look like cellular walls
inside the self or cell but like modular adjacencies when seen as parts
of a whole, making up an organism, and that’s what this story is
about... the angle, the point of view, the frame of reference.
Anyway, I was walking around the park, thinking of how as
what-we-arbitrarily-call species evolve, the boundaries between

them disappear. The names we give them go away. (Are you notic-
ing common themes in these stories?) Think of that long banquet
table at which each generation is represented by a person, we are
only one person or two away from Einstein and only a hundred or
so people away from a neolithic ancestor. Each person can talk to the
one beside him or her, maybe to someone a couple of seats away, but
pretty soon the conversation disintegrates into gibberish.
Species link to one another in a similar way. And species inhabit
the universe like plankton inhabit the seas, by gazillions. Way too
many to think.
And as intelligent species (and aren’t they all?) link up, I saw as
it were in a fast flash forward mode, they form larger and larger
organic unities, mind to mind, the language with which they previ-
ously described themselves breaking in the process (as cultures
among humans mesh and merge and self-transcend), new languages
emerging, until the animated sentient matter inhabiting the entire
known universe is like one immense organism, parts of which like
living cells articulate each through its own aperture or cultural or
planetary or galactic frame a way of seeing and thinking about what
exists.
It must be so, as Faisal (the character.not the real one) said in
Lawrence of Arabia (the film, not the book).
One might even think the goal of the universe, if such exists, and
I know evolutionary theory says it doesn’t, but what if consciousness
is both a precondition essential to the emergence of conscious forms
of life and an emergent property? and what if the goal is to link up
until everything is connected and aware of it and aware of itself
aware of it and sees the links at every level, bottom to top and all the
way back down? And what if that singular being, while thinking it
has completed a task, happens to notice a knot in a thread in the
tapestry of Everything, a snag, a little rip in the fabric, in the skein as

it were, and leans down and sees a wee tiny hole and then goes
closer, getting down on its knees, and looks through that wee tiny
hole?
What does it see, outside (as if outside/inside mean anything at
that point)?
What if...
What if the higher consciousness represented by the singular
being’s way of saying or framing addresses the way we, a single
rather primitive species on a planet just becoming aware of itself, a
part of the whole but one with the arrogance of adolescence, when it
thinks of ourselves/ourSelf/itself in our current lowly form, as if we
are just our little self or selves and not part of the whole at all?
Speaks to us, as it were? Speaks to itSelf/ourSelves, that is? Speaks to
the primitive form or larval stage to which we might regress if we
look through that wee tiny aperture and get the shock of our lives?
That universal self/Self, talking to itself... must look like me
walking around the park, seeing this story as an image of the whole,
talking it out to myself as I see and think and frame it, the way the
companion in “Scout’s Honor” talks to Scout who thinks he is what
he thinks and nothing more. Higher bigger Self to smaller public self.
Like when I preached for sixteen years, and I was a well-meaning
Episcopal priest, whacky too in a shamanistic way as one must be to
have one foot in the other world and one foot in this and know how
to move back and forth, one to the other (job description: to be
willing and able to go crazy on behalf of the congregation, then
know how to come home), and I would remind congregations that
the themes that recurred in my sermons were issues I had not
finished working through, that the Self Who Knew, as it were, was
preaching to the self that needs to keep learning (once it was worked
through, the issues would no more surface than a discussion of how
to tie our shoes, since once we master and pass beyond once-difficult

challenges, they disappear, going down down down).
Oh, about “apples.” A nod to the fruit eaten by Eve, as the story
goes, that meant the end of innocence. But also a nod to a happy time
when my oldest son Aaron and I opened his new present, an Apple
2 computer, one Christmas in Salt Lake City, Utah, thanks to beloved
Adele, my aunt (she and my Uncle Buddy saved my psychic life), a
gift to us all, and our lives changed forever... as I soon would see,
playing Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy on that primitive Apple with
my son, just as the world would be changed when it opened the
Bigger Box called networked computing.

Species, Lost in Apple-eating Time
The moon was the first step down from our front porch.
We were so proud to navigate that top step, letting ourselves
down carefully, knees scraping on the rough wood until we could
stand up and see the world from a new perspective: the tops of the
trees a little higher, the edge of the step against our legs like the
ledge of a cliff.
It seems like a dream, that time when the planet mattered, when
we were as gods. We were young then, just buds, full of the pride of
life, our outward migration a cloud of bats pouring out of a cave at
twilight. We called ourselves humanity or humankind, and we had
the audacity to make up names for other species. Whales. Lions.
Elephants.  We believed in our distinctions, dividing
everything up so it could be conquered. We followed the contours of
language into space as if what we described “out there” was inde-
pendent of ourselves. Our words wrinkled and slashed into the
spaces between the worlds and we came tumbling after.
Now we know better. Nothing is out there. Nothing at all.
Let me try to explain. Forgive my primitive images, please, and
please forgive my archaic language. I am not trying to talk down to
you. I am using metaphors preferred by children learning their first
words because that’s what humankind is and does. The Froth over-
flows your tiny cup like bubbles on the lips of a nursing child. Of
course we are not limited by Ourself(Itself) to such a small container.

And yet we are. We are the smallest bubble on the corner of that
baby’s mouth. So drink, my precious child, my beloved child, drink
all of your milk and you will grow big and wise and strong.
Out here, in the expanding space of (y)our outward migration,
we encountered trillions of windows that open onto the universe.
Even on our home planet, our small precious blue world, there were
millions of perspectives. Yet we had the arrogance to think that the
window through which we leaned, craning our necks like immi-
grants in a tenement to see past the laundry that hung between the
buildings, was the only aperture that mattered.
We called everyone else an “alien,” as the ancient Greeks called
everybody barbarians. Even after Contact, when the Little Truth
became obvious and coherent at last, when decades of periodic
encounter with anomalous and intelligent beings had finally drip-
dripdripped into a steady trickle and percolated through our defens-
es and denial died at last, even then we called them “aliens” instead
of Wrzzzzarghx or Lem-Lem-Three-bang)! or HelllenWuline. And
that was just the Tight Group from the few stars in our neighbor-
hood. The Skein was the stuff of legend then. We gave it hundreds
of  names and celebrated them all in story and song. In our innocence,
we spoke of “wormholes” as if beings of significant size could
squeeze through them and blip blip into hyperspace.  We
felt ourselves Big then, bigger than anything else, which happens
often just before the bubble pops. (Yes. Write that down, please, and
refer back to it later.) When the down-a-thousand offspring of the
HelllenWuline twice-twisted showed us how teleportation really
happens, humanity died dead. Yet memory (as we called that wrin-
kling in the diaphanous fabric of the Skein) flows that we celebrated
in the streets of thousands of cities on hundreds of planets, so excited
were we all to be free of our local star-allegiance at last. The geodesic
was so interlaced with cross talk that everyone became. The Skein

emerged in our consciousness like the grin of the Cheshire cat.
Now, when I say “we,” I mean the beings who had coalesced into
and around our common purpose then, however dimly we glimpsed
our reflected image. “We” were what we had made of ourselves, a
Being(we) that made Accidental Humanity look like a small primi-
tive tribe in a lost forest. So humanity – for all intents and purposes –
was long gone and we were more. But we still hadn’t grasped the
true nature of the Skein.
Teleportation turned us into toddlers coming down those front
steps, ready to hop skip and a-jump around the all the way around
the long way around the whole block.
But not alone. No, not alone. Once we had exchanged data with
the down-a-thousand twice-twisted spliced pairs, with the *66^^^
(the six/six) and the Yombo-wh-!~~ from far beyond the clouds in
our local groups of galaxies, we were no longer remotely human.
(Do I repeat myself? Very well, I repeat myself). Humankind had
vanished into the Strands of the Hundred-and-Twelve. Only the
museum (a crease in the Skein like a memory) preserved molecular
clusters of how it felt to think like primitive humanity, placing
ourselves at the center of the universe, as happy as rabbits scamper-
ing in the grass and as dumb as a box of rocks. So use the museum
