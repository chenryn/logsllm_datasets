User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Best practices for pagefile on an Exchange server with a large amount of RAM? I was just looking through old notes for a pair of Exchange servers that I spec'd for a project a while ago at a previous job. They were for a fairly large organization with large mail quotas, so each mailbox server had 96GB RAM. The disk layout was: 


147GB RAID1 for the OS, applications, and pagefile
1.2TB RAID 10 for the mail databases 
900GB RAID 10 for the logs


This seemed good in theory until you realize that, by default, you're going to have a 96GB pagefile on the 147GB partition, causing it to hit full-disk pretty quickly. In a situation like this, do you move the pagefile to another partition and lose the ability to recover crash dumps and also sacrifice some performance? Should I have ordered a pair of 300GB disks for the mirror instead (which is what I ended up doing)? Should I have artificially limited the pagefile size to something smaller like 32GB?

Assistant: The official recommendation from Microsoft, which hasn't changed since NT 4.0) is:


System Disk Page File 


8GB+: RAM Size + 10MB minimum
&lt;8GB: 1.5x RAM

Adding page files to other disks may increase performance up to the maximum
Total of all page files 1.5x RAM maximum, but only because Windows will never make productive use of more than that. If it's using page consistently, you need more RAM.


As you've mentioned the page file on the System drive must be as big as RAM + 10MB to get a full memory dump should the server crash. I've never found a full memory dump to be useful in diagnosing a server crash any more than a mini-dump. Servers should be configured for either mini-dumps or full-dumps, whichever you feel is going to be most beneficial to you when diagnosing crashes.

Specific to Exchange 2003, 2007, and 2010: They all defer to the OS recommendations for the page file, which is the same for WinNT 4.0 to Server 2012 as shown above. Other versions are probably the same, but I'm not familiar with them and haven't dug out the documentation.

What I would have done: Kept the 147GB disks with mini-dumps configured and about 16GB of page file.
