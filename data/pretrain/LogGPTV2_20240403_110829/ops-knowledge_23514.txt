User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题csf stop emails related to Process Tracking I have enabled LSF with CSF since I would like to receive some informations but I am being bombed by the CSF with similar emails: 

Subject: lfd on [Hostname]: Excessive resource usage: www-data

Time: Sun Jan 19 21:29:17 2014 +0100
Account: www-data
Resource: Virtual Memory Size
Exceeded: 279 &gt; 200 (MB)
Executable: /usr/lib/apache2/mpm-itk/apache2
Command Line: /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
PID: 22991 (Parent PID:12217)
Killed: No 


I have disabled the Process Tracking section in csf.conf and still receiving these logs. 

# Set the value to 0 to disable this feature
PT_LIMIT = "0"

# How frequently processes are checked in seconds
PT_INTERVAL = "3600"


I have checked many times csf.conf but cannot find the right place to stop these logs. Restarting csf does not help... Anyone knows if this is a peculiar configuration?

Assistant: Add cmd:/usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
to csf.pignore file and restart CSF and LFD (you might need to kill the lfd process)
