I have installed the pre-built PyPy interpreter in my home folder on Windows. Currently, it only allows me to execute Python scripts through its interface, similar to IDLE. I would like to extend this functionality to the command line by adding the PyPy interpreter to my system's PATH. However, I have not found any documentation on how to do this.

To add the PyPy interpreter to your PATH, follow these steps:

1. Open the Start menu.
2. Right-click on "This PC" (or "Computer" in some versions of Windows) and select "Properties."
3. Click on the "Advanced system settings" link.
4. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
5. In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable under "System variables" and select it. Then click "Edit."
6. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New" and enter the path to the directory where the PyPy executable is located (e.g., `C:\path\to\pypy`).
7. Click "OK" to close all the windows and save the changes.

After completing these steps, you should be able to run PyPy from the command line by simply typing `pypy` followed by the script name.
