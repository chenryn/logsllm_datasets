User: We use Python 3.x in our projects. But the official client of Protocol Buffers only supports python 2.x.
I don't want to downgrade to python 2.x.
Assistant: The latest version of Google Protocol Buffers (2.6) added Python 3 support. I suggest using that.
EDIT: Nevermind. They lied in their release notes.
