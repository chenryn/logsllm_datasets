### Penetration Testing: An Overview

Penetration testing, often referred to as "pentesting," is a method of simulating real-world attacks to evaluate the risk associated with potential security breaches. Unlike a vulnerability assessment, which primarily identifies vulnerabilities, a pentest involves exploiting these vulnerabilities to assess the potential impact of a successful attack.

#### The Importance of Pentesting

News stories frequently highlight major companies falling victim to cyberattacks. Often, these attacks exploit well-known vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, social engineering, and weak passwords, rather than sophisticated zero-day exploits. These security holes could have been identified and fixed through regular penetration testing, thereby preventing data breaches and protecting sensitive client information.

#### Scope and Tasks in Pentesting

The scope of a pentest varies depending on the client's needs. Some clients may have robust security postures, while others may have significant vulnerabilities. Common tasks include:

- **Assessing Custom Web Applications:** Evaluating the security of web applications.
- **Social Engineering and Client-Side Attacks:** Simulating attacks to gain access to internal networks.
- **Internal Penetration Testing:** Acting as an insider (e.g., a malicious employee) to test internal defenses.
- **External Penetration Testing:** Simulating attacks from the Internet.
- **Wireless Network Security Assessment:** Evaluating the security of wireless networks.
- **Physical Security Audits:** Assessing physical security controls.

### Stages of a Penetration Test

1. **Pre-Engagement Phase:**
   - **Client Interaction:** Discussing the client's goals, defining the scope, and agreeing on the reporting format.
   - **Understanding Business Goals:** Identifying the client's primary concerns and business risks.
   - **Scope Definition:** Determining what IP addresses, hosts, and actions are within the test's scope.
   - **Testing Window:** Agreeing on specific hours or days for testing.
   - **Contact Information:** Establishing points of contact and communication protocols.
   - **Authorization and Liability:** Obtaining formal authorization and limiting liability.
   - **Payment Terms:** Defining payment terms and including a nondisclosure agreement.

2. **Information Gathering:**
   - **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Collecting publicly available information about the client.
   - **Network Scanning:** Using tools like port scanners to identify systems and software.

3. **Threat Modeling:**
   - **Developing Attack Strategies:** Using gathered information to plan potential attack vectors.
   - **Evaluating Impact:** Assessing the potential damage if a vulnerability is exploited.

4. **Vulnerability Analysis:**
   - **Identifying Vulnerabilities:** Actively discovering vulnerabilities using both automated tools and manual analysis.
   - **Verification:** Confirming the presence of vulnerabilities and their exploitability.

5. **Exploitation:**
   - **Running Exploits:** Using tools like Metasploit to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
   - **Accessing Systems:** Gaining unauthorized access to the client's systems.

6. **Post-Exploitation:**
   - **Gathering Information:** Collecting data from compromised systems.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** Attempting to elevate privileges and pivot to other systems.
   - **Impact Assessment:** Evaluating the potential consequences of the breach.

7. **Reporting:**
   - **Executive Summary:** Providing a high-level overview of the test, findings, and recommendations.
   - **Technical Report:** Detailing the technical aspects of the test, including information gathering, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and post-exploitation phases.
   - **Risk Profile:** Quantifying the risk and providing short- and long-term remediation strategies.

### Setting Up Your Virtual Lab

To gain hands-on experience with penetration testing, you can set up a virtual lab using VMware. This section provides a step-by-step guide to setting up your lab environment.

1. **Installing VMware:**
   - **Download and Install VMware Player or Workstation:** Available for Windows and Linux. VMware Fusion is available for Mac users.
   - **VMware Player:** Free for personal use.
   - **VMware Workstation:** Offers additional features like snapshots, free for 30 days, then requires purchase.
   - **VMware Fusion:** Free trial for 30 days, costs around $50 after that.

2. **Setting Up Kali Linux:**
   - **Download Kali Linux:** A Debian-based distribution with preinstalled security tools.
   - **Recommended Version:** Kali 1.0.6 (available via torrent at http://nostarch.com/pentesting/).
   - **Decompress the 7-Zip Archive:** Use 7-Zip for Windows and Linux, or Ez7z for Mac.
   - **Open the Virtual Machine:**
     - In VMware, go to File > Open and select the Kali Linux 1.0.6 32 bit.vmx file.
     - Click the Play button and choose "I copied it" when prompted.
     - Boot Kali Linux and log in with the default credentials (root:toor).

By following these steps, you will have a fully functional virtual lab environment to practice and refine your penetration testing skills.
