I created an e2e cluster with `REGISTER_MASTER_KUBELET=true`, and the master
node is extremely unstable with docker/kubelet being restarted frequently.  
I ended up _fixing_ this by removing `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/docker.conf` to
prevent docker from being restarted again. The cluster was stable and
functioning after the fix.  
Here are my questions:
  * Is REGISTER_MASTER_KUBELET=true supposed to work in this case, or was there any other configurations that I needed to change?
  * Do we run any e2e suite with master node registered?
The docker health check performed by supervisord seems defective on the master
node in this case, but I am not sure why.
