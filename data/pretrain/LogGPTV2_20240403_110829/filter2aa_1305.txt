A Few Comments on Mind Games 
"the only way you can tell the truth," a friend at NSA said, "is through 
fiction" ... so I did ... 
"Mind Games" is a unique collection of 19 stories of brave new worlds 
and alternate realities - stories of computer hackers, deception and 
intelligence, puzzling anomalies, spirituality and mysteries of 
consciousness, the paranormal, UFOs, alien life forms - in short, 
everyday life in the 21st century. All have been previously published in 
literary, slipstream, and science fiction magazines and anthologies but 
have not been available in a single collection - until now. 
The most common response to Thieme's writing and speaking is: "You made 
me think." 
This first edition is beautifully illustrated and published by Duncan 
Long Publications. It is available for the Kindle at 
http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MC5ETA and in e-pub for the Nook. The 
retail price is $20 in print or $9.99 for an ebook. 
“The depth, complexity, and texture of Richard Thieme’s thought 
processes break the mold.” Brian Snow, Senior Technical Director, NSA (ret) 
“Thieme’s ability to communicate complex, abstract concepts and 
personalize them is like verbal origami.” - Jeff Moss, Director, Black 
Hat, a division of TechWeb/United Business Media, and a member of the 
DHS HSAC 
“Silent Emergent, Doubly Dark” is ... very imaginative writing, with a 
complexity that raises [the story] to the fringes of slipstream. We’re 
left wondering what’s real and what’s not ....” Steven Pirie, /The 
Future Fire/ 
“Beautiful descriptions and intriguing concepts ...” The Fix (UK). 
“Thieme’s clarity of thinking is refreshing, and his insights are 
profound.” Bruce Schneier, security technologist and author. 
“Buy this book!” – Robert Morris, Sr. Chief Scientist, NSA (ret), 
holding up /Islands in the Clickstream /at the Black Hat Briefings/. / 
“The reader is left reeling, dizzy with insight.” Robin Roberts, 
Information Security R&D, CIA (ret) 
"Richard Thieme takes us to the edge of cliffs we know are there but 
rarely visit. He wonderfully weaves life, mystery, and passion through 
digital and natural worlds with creativity and imagination. Delightful 
and deeply thought provoking reading." - Clint Brooks, former Senior 
Advisor for Homeland Security and Assistant Deputy Director, NSA 
“In his writing and speeches, Thieme has never let me down. Always 
informative, relevant, unpredictable and thoroughly entertaining ... 
.one of the great thinkers of the cyber-world.” - Larry Greenblatt, 
InterNetwork Defense 
insightful review by J. M. Arrigo, a professor familiar with "the dark 
side" of intelligence operations - 
This extraordinary book of short stories draws the reader into multiple 
levels of reality and multiple dimensions. The settings are mostly 
futuristic, as in engineered societies. But the principles of social 
engineering are laid bare, inducing the reader to reflect on current 
values, desires, and markers of progress. 
The story that resonates most with me is a subtle account of a married 
couple's evening out with friends, "Incident at Wolf Cave." On return 
home at night -- by the husband/narrator's account --they are witness to 
UFOs over a lake. Next day, when the husband remarks on the sighting, 
the wife denies it. This incident closes the door to the psychic flow 
between them, and they gradually divorce. A UFO story, yes, but who has 
not felt this closing of the door when reality changes for one friend 
but not another? 
The form of the book, consonant with the theme, veers into another 
dimension of literature. The short introduction to each story describes 
the author's relevant life experiences, quests, or critiques. Rather 
than demystifying the story, the author thereby locks the reader more 
securely into the mystery of the story. Artist Duncan Long has also 
provided a sort of portrait introduction to each story, in which the 
boundary between line drawing and photograph cannot be discerned -- 
another play on the junctures of different realities. 
Liking and disliking is maybe not the right attitudinal axis for this 
book. Better: Are we game for these uncomfortable mental adventures in 
consciousness and the nature of reality? 
Comment on Mind Games from a good buddy at one of the agencies: 
 There he is, brain the size of a small planet, and 
what do they ask him? "Should we file this under fiction or non-fiction, 
Richard?" You'd think that they'd never considered the possibility that it's 
all true and all fiction, just ...different dimensions of the same experience...
