I have used this on several occasions to bypass poor security protocols. During one investigation, I had 
encountered a web forum of a hacking group that always appeared blank upon visit. Google had indexed it, but 
I could not see any content. By changing my default agent to Firefox on a Linux machine, 1 was allowed to see 
the content. The group had enabled a script that would only allow the page to

Please note that user-agent spoofing will not fool every website. If the target site includes JavaScript which scans 
for additional identifiers, such as touch points and video cards, the real details may be presented. I host a 
demonstration page at https://intcltechniques.com/loggcr/ which you can use to see how some sites may 
bypass your trickery. While this level of scrutiny is rare, it is a possibility. Always know what websites may be 
able to see about your computer and connection before any sensitive investigation. Refresh my test page as you

serves as an easy way to quickly identify interesting content. You will learn more about online archives later in 
this book.

Using the utility is fairly straightforward. While on any website, select any or all text, right-click anywhere in the 
page, and select the ’’Copy selected links" option in the menu. The links will be stored in your clipboard and you 
can paste them into Notepad, Excel, or any other productivity application. There are unlimited uses for Copy 
Selected Links, and below are a few of my favorite.
Figure 3.15: A reverse image search menu.
A later chapter explains reverse image search engines and how they can identify more target photographs. 
Popular options include Google Images and TinEye. This extension automates the reverse search when an image 
is right-clicked. When installed, "Image Search Options" is present when you right-click on an image. 
Highlighting this option presents several reverse image search sendees including Google, Bing, TinEye, Yandex, 
Baidu, and others. You wall later learn how my online search tool will execute an image search across all of those 
sendees at once. However, this tool can be beneficial due to the convenience and obscure services such as Karma 
Decay, which looks for copies of images on Reddit. This add-on removes any excuse to not always check reverse 
images on target websites. With this add-on enabled, you will be ready to enhance your searches during that 
investigation. Figure 3.15 displays the options after right-clicking an image located on a target website.
This extension provides a link to archived versions of websites whenever a page has been modified, is 
unavailable, or has been deleted. Right-clicking on any site will offer a new menu option of "Resurrect this page". 
That option will present the following archive sendees.

Using "Share as web page" is not recommended as it creates an html page of your tab group on the OneTab 
servers. The preferred method for transferring OneTab bookmarks is to use the export feature, which is found 
in the upper right menu. This will allow you to copy your links as plain text URLs and paste them into a more 
secure platform. OneTab defaults to deleting the bookmarks from a group if you select "Restore all". To change 
this behavior, select "Options" and select "Keep them in your OneTab list". Right-clicking on a web page wall 
bring up the OneTab context menu which allows for more granular tab selection, as seen in Figure 3.16 (right). 
OneTab collects no user data unless you intentionally click on the "Share as web page" feature. Barring that 
feature, all data is stored locally on your workstation.

native links to all files encountered. This is helpful for documentation after downloading all of the data.
Performing screenshots during my investigation in these examples would never identify the direct links to the 
visible content. Only hovering over the links would temporarily identify the source. A com inauon o screen 
captures and link collection with this add-on provides a much more comprehensive report.
Interacting with the management page is straight forward. At the top of each tab set is an editable tide which 
defaults to the number of tabs in that group. Left-click on the dde to change it to something logical for that set 
of links, such as "Username Subject X". To the right of the tide is a date and timestamp indicating when the list 
was saved. You can drag and drop individual bookmarks to change the order in each group or to move links 
from one group to another. Clicking on "Restore all" will re-open each of the bookmarks into its own tab. The 
bookmarks are links, not saved pages, so you will be reloading any non-cached page content from the remote 
host. Selecting "Delete all" will destroy the bookmarks in that group. Selecting "More...' gives options to 
rename, lock, or star the tab group. "Star this tab group" pins that group to the top of your management page, 
independent of the date and time created.

This extension provides simple and effective management of browser tabs by allowing you to collapse any open 
pages into a list of bookmarks. Once installed, it is activated by clicking on the blue funnel icon on your toolbar. 
Doing so will close any open tabs and open the OneTab management page, as seen in Figure 3.16 (left). The 
collapsed tabs are displayed on this page as a group of bookmarks. Each individual bookmark is made up of a 
page title, with the respective URL embedded as a link. Any previously saved tab groups are stored further down 
the page in reverse chronological order.

Downloading and opening this link within VLC media player, which is explained in the next chapter, plays the 
entire video within the software. The Linux-based Python tools which we create in the next chapter help us 
download the entire video for offline use. While this extension may seem complicated now, it will simplify 
archiving of online video streams in the next chapter. For now, the power of this utility is the ability to document 
our evidence. I can now disclose the exact digital source of the video stream. This can be extremely valuable 
when a website is later removed or altered, but the media remains untouched on the media hosting server. We 
will explore online video streams much more later. If this extension provides value to your investigations, but 
you find some sites which do not function, consider adding another Firefox extension tided The m3u8 Stream 
Detector (addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/the-m3u8-stream-detector). It may pick up missing streams.
This extension has become vital during my daily OSINT routines due to the prevalence of streaming video 
within my daily investigations. Whether pre-recorded or live, many websites now deliver video via embedded 
streams rather than traditional files. While we could once easily right-click an online video and download the file 
as an MP4, that is rare today. We must now be prepared to encounter video stream protocols such as playlists 
(M3U8) and transport stream (TS). Let's start with an example.
While writing this chapter, sources on Twitter reported the death of Sean Connery’. The page displaying various 
news articles (https://twitter.eom/i/events/1322516496564723713) included a post with video which linked to 
cnn.com. Right-clicking this video provided an option to play the video, but nothing to download it. Monitoring 
the network activity of the page through "Inspect Element" presented numerous small files, none of which were 
the entire video. However, clicking on the Stream Detector extension presented the options visible in Figure 
3.17. The bottom "master" option is a link to the M3U8 stream which is responsible for the video playback. 
Clicking this link copies it to the clipboard. The full link is as follows.

Exporting and Importing a Pre-Configured Profile

The following instructions allow you to export your final settings and import the same customizations into other 
investigative computers. The details will vary slightly based on your operating system and version. Only execute 
this tutorial on a new install of Firefox that has no saved settings, or within a version of Firefox that you want 
to be overwritten. Do not overwrite your current version if you have bookmarks, extensions, or other data that
It is important to provide the URL of each website within the entries in the KeePassXC application. When you 
store your username and password for each service, also include the URL in the appropriate field, such as 
https://twitter.com. It is vital to include the exact URL, including "https://". This allows the extension to match 
the URL on the current page to the entry in your password database. Consider the following typical scenario.
Installation of this extension is straightforward. However, it will not work undl you make some modifications 
to your password manager application. This extension is simply a conduit to bring the program functionality 
into the browser. The first step is to make sure you have the KeePassXC program and database configured on 
the machine which you want access. If you are installing the browser extension within Firefox on your VM, but 
your program is on the host computer, they cannot see each other. In this scenario, you will possess KeePassXC 
and a password database on your VM (explained in the next chapter), and add this browser extension to Firefox 
within this same VM.
In a previous chapter, I explained the requirement to possess a reliable password manager within your 
investigative computer. 1 choose the application KeePassXC because it is secure and completely offline. I do 
not want to keep my usernames and passwords to my covert accounts within any online third-party database. 
While data exposure is unlikely, I cannot take the chance. Personally, I prefer to copy and paste my passwords 
directly from the password manager application into the browser. I realize I am more paranoid than the average 
investigator in matters related to privacy. I also respect that you may need a more convenient option to 
automatically enter your passwords into multiple covert accounts. My suggested solution offers the convenience 
of automatically populated passwords with the privacy of an offline database.
In my KeePassXC database, I have several entries for various covert Facebook profiles. When I visit 
facebook.com, I click on the username field at the login prompt. I immediately see a list of all my covert 
accounts, which is retrieved from my KeePassXC database. I can also right-click within a login field and ask my 
browser to populate the credentials. When I select the desired username, that name and password are 
automatically populated into the browser. 1 can log in to that account without typing or pasting a password. All 
of this happens without relying on a connection to an online password manager. The data is transferred through 
your local machine, and your passwords are never sent via internet, within plain text or encrypted. This is an 
offline solution which provides a level of security an online password manager could never supply.
At this point, it may seem overwhelming when thinking about the abundance of add-ons and their proper 
configurations. I currently use several Windows, Apple, and Linux virtual machines and must keep my Firefox 
browser updated on all of them. 1 no longer manually update each browser. Instead, 1 maintain a single Firefox 
browser that includes all customizations that 1 desire. I then import these settings into any other browsers in 
order to replicate the experience across every computer I use. In a moment, I share my profile with you for easy 
import.
Once you have the application and extension installed, navigate to the "preferences", "options", or "tools" menu 
(varies by OS and version). Click on "Browser Integration" in the left menu and select the box to enable this 
feature. Specify which browsers should have access and save your changes. Back in Firefox, open the 
KeePassXC menu and click "Connect". You should be prompted within your KeePassXC application to allow 
this connection, and you will be asked to provide a name for the configuration. Once complete, you are ready 
to start using this extension.

following steps will overwrite any custom options applied to your target Firefox installations.
While I prefer readers create their own Firefox configuration, I respect that a lot of effort is required to replicate 
these steps within multiple machines. Therefore, 1 have created a custom file which includes ever}7 configuration 
explained within this chapter. It can be used within any instance of Firefox on Windows, Mac, or Linux. It could 
even be used on your new custom Linux Ubuntu VM created previously. Let's walk through each option.
Ubuntu Linux: Launch Firefox then close the application. Open Terminal and enter the following commands, 
striking enter after each, omitting the explanations within parentheses.
The result should be a copy of Firefox which contains even7 add-on you configured from this chapter. This 
profile could be copied to an unlimited number of computers, as long as the versions of Firefox were identical. 
1 once visited a large fusion center which had created a custom Firefox profile for use on all computers. This 
made everyone s version of Firefox practically identical and ready for online investigations. When an employee 
was assigned to a different workstation, the look and feel of the browser was identical. This also included
