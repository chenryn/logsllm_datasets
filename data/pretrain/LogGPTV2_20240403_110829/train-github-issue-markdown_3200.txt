The Codecov number on https://github.com/scipy/scipy is 76%. There are a
number of issues with this:
  * `setup.py` files are measured, they should be excluded
  * `test_*` files should probably be excluded
  * There may be other random files that should be excluded, e.g. `scipy/special/_precompute/*`.
  * The number is low because of parts of vendored C and Fortran libraries that we simply don't use but did not remove. Not sure what the best solution is there, perhaps more trouble than it's worth. Would be good to have a Python-only coverage number though, to see where there are actual gaps.
