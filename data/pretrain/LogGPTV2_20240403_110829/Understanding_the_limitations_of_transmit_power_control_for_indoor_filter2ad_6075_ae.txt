to reﬂect small scale changes in the wireless environments
in our model. However the set of power levels must be re-
computed against large scale changes in the wireless wire-
less environment like transmitter mobility, introduction of
a new physical obstacle or a new interference source. We
are investigating various triggering mechanisms to refresh
the Model-TPC, although a simple strategy to refresh the
model every 10 minutes seems to work ﬁne for our indoor
experiments.
5. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF
MODEL-TPC
To validate our model, we pick an existing algorithm [16]
that uses transmit power control for improving client through-
put and spatial re-use. The algorithm proposed increases
transmit power in steps and measures signal quality to as-
certain the optimal power setting for a given client.
At a high level, the algorithm operates as follows. It starts
with the lowest power level and performs normal data rate
adaptation using Onoe [1](a standard data rate adaptation
mechanism). Once the data rate stabilizes around a value,
the power level is increased and the rate adaptation process
is continued. This process is repeated until the transmitter
reach the maximum rate available or reaches the highest
power level.
To demonstrate the beneﬁts of our proposed model, we
create a set of useful power levels through Model-TPC and
restrict the above algorithm to use only this set of power
levels in its adaptations. We then compare the adaptation
performance of the algorithm under two diﬀerent scenarios
– (i) which uses all possible power levels as available from
the wireless interface, and does not use our model-TPC, and
(ii) which uses the power levels provided by Model-TPC.
There are two beneﬁts of Model-TPC: First, it allows for
signiﬁcantly faster convergence for the transmitters to the
best suited power level in their operating environments. Sec-
ond, by eliminating the need to explore many redundant
power levels with corresponding poor throughput perfor-
mance, the transmitters achieve higher throughput over the
entire adaptation duration. This is particularly important
for clients that are mobile in nature and hence, need to adapt
their transmission parameters, including power levels, quite
frequently. We illustrate these gains through our reference
implementation of the algorithm in [16], both with and
without Model-TPC.
5.1 Setup
For the experiment described, the setup is identical to
NLOS scenario, with the transmitter using an Atheros card
having ﬁve power levels as validated by our power level val-
idation setup in Figure 4. The mobile client continuously

transmits data from itself to a departmental server located
at the position of receiver R2, shown in Figure 2. The client
roams from locations T1 to T2 to T3, which are annotated in
the Figure 2 of our indoor WLAN deployment. Initially the
client is at T1, which has 3 feasible power levels of 10mW,
20mW and 40mW, as per Model-TPC. After 12 seconds, the
client goes to location T2, which is very close (LOS) to the
server R2 and hence the client is decreases its power level
and is able to use the lowest power level of 10mW to achieve
a data rate of 54Mbps. After 2 seconds, the client again
moves to location T3, which has four feasible power levels
as per our empirical model. We show the data rate and
power adaptation process at T1 and T3 (The adaptation at
T2 is obvious, with the client simply reducing power levels
as it is very close to the server).
5.2 Results
We present the cumulative distribution function of the
instantaneous throughput (measured every 100 ms) of the
two variants of the transmit power control algorithm in Fig-
ure 14. The ﬁgure shows that using Model-TPC to restrict
power levels lead to higher instantaneous throughput for a
signiﬁcant part of the experiment as shown in Figure 16. We
explain this diﬀerence by examining the adaptation mecha-
nisms in the two cases in Figure 15.
Figure 15(a) shows the adaptation behavior when all ﬁve
power levels are used by the algorithm. We can see that
over time, the algorithm attempts to identify signal qual-
ity at each diﬀerent data rate and power level, spending a
signiﬁcant amount of time testing parameter values which
are redundant for a give environment, thus impacting per-
formance. In contrast, Figure 15(b) shows that adaptation
with our Model-TPC. Clearly adaptation is much faster with
our model, with more pronounced gains at T1 (as diﬀerence
between hardware and feasible power levels is more) than
T3.
Note that here we only show the throughput gains arising
from quicker convergence from a small power level to the
right (greater) power level for locations T1 and T3. Model-
TPC also provides much better convergence when adapting
from a high power level to lower (right) power level as for
T2, by skipping all the redundant high power levels in be-
tween. A faster convergence reduces the energy consumed
in scanning high power levels and leads to energy savings,
which is an important consideration for mobile clients. Due
to lack of space, we do not present our energy results in this
section.
5.3 Summary
Our gains of in the above Internet-oriented wireless exper-
iments stem from faster adaptation achievable when using
the Model-TPC as an input to power control. Note that
in our experiments, we compared beneﬁts when only ﬁve
power levels are available from the wireless interface. The
performance gains of Model-TPC will only be greater if the
wireless interface makes more power levels available to the
system software, that will clearly increase the number of
redundant channels that transmitter will scan in a typical
power control algorithm, while our model will facilitate much
faster convergence and performance.
6. DISCUSSION
While our work in this paper is targeted towards indoor
WLANs, we discuss the relevance of our work in context of
cellular networks, where power control is again an impor-

tant design parameter. Power control in cellular networks
is used for reducing co-channel interference, managing voice
quality, dealing with fast fading and near-far problem [11,
18]. However cellular networks primarily operate in outdoor
environments, where the eﬀects of multipath are mush less
pronounced as shown in Figure 3. Moreover, cellular net-
works do not perform rate adaptation in the inner loop (real
time or per packet basis) of power control, whereas data rate
adaptation is an integral component of 802.11 based WLAN
systems. Thus the SNR threshold for cellular networks is
varied slowly in the outer loop of power control, whereas in
WLANs, data rate adaptation is performed on very small
time scales, thereby making RSSI variations even more crit-
ical for system performance.
7. RELATED WORK
We discussed prior work on power control mechanisms in
Section 2. In this section, we present other previous work
that deals with signal strength measurement and character-
ization for wireless networks.
• Measurement based modeling : Some recent ef-
forts have been made to use empirical observations
to improve wireless protocols. Reis et al.[8] propose
a measurement based model for delivery and inter-
ference in static wireless networks. Their work takes
RSSI values of wireless packets as an input to predict
the delivery rate and interference in the system. Di-
vert [4] attempts to reduce packet loss rates in WLAN
systems by rapidly switching between APs to tolerate
bursty losses. ExOR [6] leverages spatial loss indepen-
dence to reduce packet transmissions in multi-hop net-
works by using opportunistic packet reception. These
eﬀorts indicate that there is much room to improve
wireless protocols by adapting them to realistic condi-
tions. Our work provides one such tool.
• RF-based location determination : RF-based lo-
cation determination mechanisms [22, 15] use signal
strength values for ﬁngerprinting diﬀerent locations in
a WLAN. Kaemarungsi et al.
[13] study the prop-
erties of indoor received signal strength for location
ﬁngerprinting. They propose an analytical model for
indoor positioning system by modeling the RSSI vari-
ations as a Gaussian distribution. While such work
in location determination had to examine RSSI (and
hence, power) variations between a transmitter and a
receiver, the focus of such RF-based localization tech-
nique did not require a careful exploration of various
power level choices, and their implications on power
control mechanisms.
• Feasibility Analysis : Abdesslem et al [9] describe
the hardware and software limitations, like limited power
levels in the wireless chipsets and lack of suitable de-
vice drivers, that hinder the implementation of trans-
mit power control mechanisms. While their work is
an important step towards determining feasibility of
power control mechanisms (due to hardware/software
limitations), they do not explore the more fundamen-
tal issues with ﬁne grained power control that arise
due to the inherent nature of wireless medium.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Multipath, fading, shadowing and external interference
from wireless devices, make the implantation of power con-
trol mechanism challenging in practical settings. The focus
of this paper has been in understanding what the right set
of power control mechanisms are useful to design eﬃcient
power control algorithms. More speciﬁcally, we show that
ﬁne-grained power control cannot be eﬀectively used by such
algorithms in a systematic manner. In fact, our work sug-
gests that a few 3-5 discrete power level choices is suﬃcient
to implement any robust power control mechanism in typ-
ical indoor WLAN environments. Through our work, we
also build an empirical model that guides these appropri-
ate number and choices of power values that is adequate.
Our model can be used as a plug-in to previously proposed
power control mechanisms, to make them implementable in
real settings. We believe our work provides an important
framework that can be used by researchers to develop ro-
bust and practical power control mechanisms.
We have used NKLD as a statistical tool to measure the
distance between two RSSI distributions. Although it works
well for our environments and is easy to compute in a real
time fashion, there are other statistical tools like moment
based estimators, that capture the spread of the two dis-
tributions better and may be more eﬀective in distinguish-
ing between two probability distributions. Comparing the
performance of NKLD with moment based estimators is an
avenue of future work for us.
We are also investigating various triggering mechanisms to
refresh Model-TPC. Currently we refresh it periodically ev-
ery 10 minutes, which not be optimal for every scenario. The
refresh period is tightly coupled with large scale variations
in the wireless environments, like addition of an interfering
source or a new obstacle and we are performing more exper-
iments to detect such changes that can trigger the update
of Model-TPC.
Although our main objective is to evaluate the feasibil-
ity of using ﬁne grained power control in indoor environ-
ments, the model developed in this section can be read-
ily used by access points (APs) to proﬁle various locations
in the environment and perform location-based power con-
trol. Through collaborative measurements made by diﬀerent
clients over time, the APs can create a location-dependent
model for power control which can be downloaded to clients
during association. Also the network as a whole could aggre-
gate such models to create a single model which is network
dependent but location independent that trades-oﬀ complex-
ity and accuracy for simplicity of use. We are currently look-
ing such location-speciﬁc power control approaches that can
be implemented using a centralized controller that manages
the wireless APs in enterprise WLANs. The ﬂexibility in
estimating and building the empirical model allows for its
applicability to a wide range of power control algorithms and
might ﬁnd interest outside the scope of 802.11 networks.
