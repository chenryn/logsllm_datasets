User: I am trying to install 3DR solo command line on Windows 10.  Below is the exception that i get.  i have been doing a lot of reading and googling.  I couldnt figure out the permission denied problem.  I have this part  shutil.copyfile(srcfile, destfile), but i still get denied.  
Exception:

Assistant: This is going to sound simple but are you running an elevated command line?
