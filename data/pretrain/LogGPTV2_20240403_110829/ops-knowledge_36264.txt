I am attempting to install the 3DR Solo command-line tool on Windows 10, but I encounter an exception. Despite extensive research and troubleshooting, I have been unable to resolve the "Permission denied" error. The problematic line in my code is `shutil.copyfile(srcfile, destfile)`. Below is the full traceback of the exception:

```

    with open(dst, 'wb') as fdst:
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'c:\\python35\\Lib\\site-packages\\_cffi_backend.cp35-win32.pyd'
```

I am unsure how to proceed. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

**Response:**

It sounds like you may not be running the command prompt with elevated privileges. Here are a few steps to help you resolve the "Permission denied" error:

1. **Run Command Prompt as Administrator:**
   - Right-click on the Command Prompt icon.
   - Select "Run as administrator."
   - Try running your installation command again.

2. **Check File Permissions:**
   - Ensure that the destination directory (`c:\python35\Lib\site-packages`) has the necessary write permissions for your user account.
   - You can do this by right-clicking on the directory, selecting "Properties," then the "Security" tab, and checking the permissions.

3. **Close Running Processes:**
   - Sometimes, other processes might be using the file. Close any applications or processes that might be accessing the Python files or directories.

4. **Use a Virtual Environment:**
   - Consider using a virtual environment to avoid permission issues. You can create and activate a virtual environment with the following commands:
     ```sh
     python -m venv myenv
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     pip install 3DR-solo-command-line
     ```

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your setup and any additional error messages.
