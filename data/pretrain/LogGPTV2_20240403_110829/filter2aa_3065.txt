#### Introduction
- **Initial Perspective:** The early view was that the Internet could "route around" legal constraints.
- **Current Perspective:** It is now recognized that the Internet cannot always bypass the law, and we must work within the legal framework.

#### Case Study: RIAA v. Verizon
- **Subpoena:** The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) demanded the identities of four alleged KaZaA users from Verizon.
- **Challenge:** Verizon refused to disclose the names and took the matter to court to protect user privacy.
- **Court Order:** The court ordered Verizon to reveal the names, but this decision is currently under appeal.

#### Law Enforcement Beyond Government
- **Private Actors' Legal Tools:**
  - Cease-and-desist letters
  - Subpoenas
  - Civil lawsuits

#### Internet Architectures and Private Control
- **Chokepoints in the Network:**
  - Centralization in a decentralized network (e.g., ISPs, backbone providers, DNS)
  - "Public" content on the Internet is stored on private servers.

---

#### Monitoring and Legal Claims
- **Increased Publishing Capabilities:**
  - The Internet enables more people to publish content cheaply and reach a wider audience.
  - It also allows more individuals and corporations to monitor and challenge that speech.
- **Common Legal Claims:**
  - Copyright infringement (e.g., copying or circumventing another's work)
  - Trademark infringement
  - Patent infringement

---

#### Chilling Effects
- **Definition:**
  - Chilling effects occur when the threat of legal action deters online activity, even if the threats lack merit.
- **Examples:**
  - Threats of injunctions, disgorgement of revenues, statutory damages, and attorneys' fees.

---

#### Resisting the Chill

  - To resist such threats, it is crucial to know the law and available legal defenses.
