The Internet’s Private Cops
 Early view: The Internet can “route around” law
 Later view: Maybe it can’t.  We need to work 
with the law itself.

Internet architectures facilitate 
private control
 Law and technology create chokepoints: 
centralization in the decentralized network
– ISPs, backbone providers, DNS 
 “Public” content on the Net is stored on 
private servers

 Internet enables more people to publish, 
cheaply, to more other people; 
 It also enables more people and corporations 
to monitor that speech

 The work draws inspiration from (“copies”) another
 or interoperates with (“circumvents”) another

Chilling Effects
the shadow of the law
 Legal threats may not have merit…
…but still deter online activity
 Threats such as: “an injunction, disgorgement 
of revenues and/or statutory damages, as well 
as attorneys fees and costs for such litigation”

 Legal threats are often used against 
“obnoxious” but not illegal activities.
 To resist the chill, know the law and legal
