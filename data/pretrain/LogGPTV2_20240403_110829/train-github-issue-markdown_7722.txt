We need to address the behavior of `styled-jsx`'s Global mode when used in the `_document` file. Currently, it functions correctly during development but fails to work as expected in the production environment.

By "fix," I mean we should ensure consistent behavior across both environments. This could involve either making it work in production or disabling its functionality in the development environment to maintain consistency.
