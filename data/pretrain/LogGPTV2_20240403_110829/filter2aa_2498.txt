Surveillance Detection
TL;DR
Autopilot cameras are good 
for a lot more than driving. 
So are Teslas.
Why Tesla?
•Three Cameras Built In* 
•Detailed Vehicle/Owner API 
•Sentry Mode (Always On) 
•In-Car Web Browser
Surveillance Detection Scout
•Real-Time License Plate Recognition 
•Real-Time Familiar Face Detection 
•Recon/Pattern of Life Querying 
•Open-Source & Locally Deployed
“Real-Time” Defined
Inference starts 
as soon as an 
mp4 hits disk*
Counter-Surveillance Scenarios
•While Parked: Which cars/people 
are loitering near my house/car? 
•During Your Drive: How long has 
that car been behind me? Have I 
seen that car before?
Recon Query Scenarios
•Tailgating: What time does my 
target arrive/leave the office? 
•Lockpicking: How often does 
security make rounds? At what 
hours is the building empty?
