### Log Analysis and Recommendations

**Log Entry:**
```
Jun 17 19:43:13 combo sshd(pam_unix)[30565]: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=211.46.224.253 user=guest
```

**Analysis:**
- **Date and Time:** June 17, 19:43:13
- **Host:** `combo`
- **Service:** `sshd` (SSH daemon)
- **Process ID (PID):** 30565
- **Authentication Mechanism:** `pam_unix`
- **User ID (UID):** 0
- **Effective User ID (EUID):** 0
- **TTY:** `NODEV` (no TTY device)
- **Remote User:** Not specified (`ruser=`)
- **Remote Host IP:** 211.46.224.253
- **Local User:** `guest`

**Exception Type:**
- **Authentication Failure**

**Reasons for the Authentication Failure:**
- The `guest` user attempted to connect to the SSH service on the `combo` host from the IP address `211.46.224.253`.
- The authentication attempt failed, which could be due to:
  - An incorrect password.
  - Misconfiguration of other authentication mechanisms (e.g., public key authentication).
  - The `guest` user account may not have permission to access the system via SSH.

**Recommended Solutions:**
1. **Verify Password:**
   - Ensure that the `guest` user's password is correct and has not been changed or expired.
   - If the password is correct, consider changing it to a more secure one and ensure the user knows the new password.

2. **Check Authentication Configuration:**
   - Review the SSH configuration file (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) to ensure that the `PasswordAuthentication` and `PubkeyAuthentication` settings are correctly configured.
   - Verify that the `guest` user's public key (if using key-based authentication) is correctly placed in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file and has the appropriate permissions.

3. **Review User Permissions:**
   - Confirm that the `guest` user has the necessary permissions to access the system via SSH. This can be checked by examining the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files, as well as any group policies that may affect SSH access.

4. **Monitor for Unauthorized Access Attempts:**
   - Check the SSH logs for any repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or other suspicious activity.
   - Consider implementing a firewall rule or using a tool like `fail2ban` to block IP addresses that exhibit patterns of unauthorized access attempts.

By following these steps, you can identify and resolve the authentication issue, ensuring that only authorized users can access your system via SSH.
