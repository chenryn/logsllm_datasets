#### Log Summary
- **Test Context:**
  - The test was executed as part of the `kubernetes-e2e-gke` job, build number 1976.
  - **Timestamps:**
    - Test start: 14:50:44
    - BeforeEach setup: 14:53:07
    - Test execution: 14:53:07

- **Setup Steps:**
  - Created a Kubernetes client.
  - Built a namespace API object.
  - Waited for the default service account to be provisioned in the namespace `e2e-tests-deployment-1groa`.

- **Service Account Provisioning:**
  - Initially, the service account `default` was not found.
  - After several attempts, the service account was found with secrets after 8.056 seconds.

- **Test Execution:**
  - The test waited for 3 sample pods to be created, which were successfully found.
  - Ensured each pod was running.
  - Waited for the pod `nginx-controller-hpovs` to reach the 'running' state.
  - The pod remained in the 'Pending' phase and did not transition to 'running' within the 5-minute timeout.

#### Detailed Log
- **Service Account Provisioning:**
  - **14:53:07** - Service account `default` in namespace `e2e-tests-deployment-1groa` was found with secrets after 8.056 seconds.

- **Pod Status Monitoring:**
  - **14:53:07** - Pod `nginx-controller-hpovs` was monitored for 5 minutes, but it remained in the 'Pending' phase.
  - **Timeout at 14:53:07** - The test timed out after 5 minutes, as the pod did not transition to the 'running' state.
