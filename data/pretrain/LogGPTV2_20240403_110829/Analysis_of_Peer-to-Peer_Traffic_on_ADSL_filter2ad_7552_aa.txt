Abstract. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications now generate the majority
of Internet traﬃc, particularly for users on ADSL because of ﬂatrate
tariﬁcation. In this study, we focus on four popular P2P systems to
characterize the utilization, the performance and the evolution of P2P
traﬃc in general. We observe and compare the inﬂuence of each P2P
application over the traﬃc, and we evaluate the evolution of these P2P
systems over a year. Our analysis is based on ADSL traﬃc captured at
TCP level on a Broadband Access Server comprising thousands of users.
Thus, we characterize the P2P traﬃc and users, and we draw interesting
results on connectivity and cooperation between peers, localization of
sources, termination of connections and performance limitations. The
evolution of the traﬃc over the year allows us to see the dynamics of
the use of P2P systems. The diﬀerence between week days and week-end
days informs us about the behavior of P2P users.

Introduction
This study is based on TCP captures on ADSL, which are used to establish
general characteristics of P2P systems. The fact that we take into account only
ADSL traﬃc is important, because these users are predominantly present in P2P
traﬃc. Indeed 24 hours per day, unlimited connection is proposed by ISPs to the
ADSL customers. And as we shall see, P2P ﬁle sharing systems thus account for
more than 60% of the total ADSL traﬃc.
The originality of our measures lies in the fact that, ﬁrstly, we analyze all
the TCP ﬂows of a regional ADSL concentrating point, secondly, we observe
only ADSL traﬃc (excluding modems 56k) which is more representative of P2P
utilization, and thirdly, the data collected is representative of general ADSL
users and not restricted to a speciﬁc class of users or hosts (e.g. a University or
a private network). Furthermore, our data include several thousands of users.
We shall diﬀerentiate systematically between the P2P users with the help of
a unique ADSL user identiﬁcation. As noticed in [7], an analysis based on IP ad-
dresses can have a negative inﬂuence on the interpretation of the traces because

of NATs (Network Address Translator) and dynamic IP addresses. Indeed, we
noticed a signiﬁcant qualitative diﬀerence between graphs based on IP addresses
and those based on ADSL users.
In this study, we compare four popular P2P networks: eDonkey [2], BitTorrent
[1], FastTrack and WinMX [3].
The evolution over a year shows that the popularity of P2P networks is very
volatile, this popularity is also very dependent on the country.
Our ﬂow level analysis enables us to describe volumetric properties, con-
nection duration, traﬃc pattern over time, host connectivity and geographical
location of peers. Then we map some of these experimental distributions into
classical statistical laws. Our packet level analysis allows us to clearly identify be-
ginning and termination of connections leading to some ﬁndings on performance
limitations. We mention here two interesting results:
– about 40% of connections are only connection reattempts, and it concerns
about 30% of peers;
– there are two main classes of peers: those contributing to most of the traﬃc
volumes, and the other. The ﬁrst class aﬀects strongly the main charac-
teristics of the P2P system, while the second one softly inﬂuences these
characteristics.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the
methodology for our measurements. In Section 3, we elaborate some relevant
characteristics of P2P traﬃc, such as proportion of signaling traﬃc, comparison
of upstream and downstream volumes, connection duration, traﬃc pattern over
time, geographical distribution of peers and termination of connections. Section
4 deals with the number of connections a peer establishes. We summarize the
main results and conclude the paper in Section 5.
2 Capture Methodology and P2P Overview
2.1 Measurement Details
First of all, we detail our experimentation protocol. As shown in Figure 1, the
BAS1 collects the traﬃc issued from the DSLAM2 before forwarding it through
the POP3 to the France Telecom IP backbone. Our probe is located between a
BAS and the IP backbone. We draw attention to the fact that we capture all
TCP packets without any sampling or loss. We perform an analysis of the traﬃc
over week days and week-end days of September 2004 and we compare these
results with those computed over data recorded one year ago (in June 2003).
The identiﬁcation of P2P protocols is done through a port analysis: a con-
nection is classiﬁed as a P2P protocol if one of its TCP ports is a standard port
of this protocol. We shall discuss the accuracy of this method in Section 2.2.

We shall denote as local peers or users the ADSL hosts connected to the
observed BAS, and as non-local or distant peers the remainder of the hosts. The
upstream traﬃc will represent the packets transferred from local peers to the
backbone, and the downstream traﬃc those transferred from the backbone to
the local peers.
2.2 Overall P2P Overview
In our data, about 60% of the traﬃc lies on P2P ports in September 2004. It
represents a small drop compared to the proportion of traﬃc on P2P ports in
June 2003 which was about 65%.
In Table 1, we reported the distribution of the main P2P protocols over P2P
traﬃc. In September 2004, eDonkey is by far the most popular protocol in terms
of volume, BitTorrent is the second most popular and all the other protocols are
almost negligible in volume as compared to eDonkey.
The popularity of each P2P ﬁle sharing system is very variable among loca-
tion and time. According to [11] in October 2003, in Europe, eDonkey is over-
whelmingly popular whereas in U.S. FastTrack is the most popular followed
by WinMX. The evolution over time on our data shows that FastTrack lost its
72

popularity in France (more than a year back, in June 2003, the proportion of
volume of FastTrack traﬃc was the second most important).
In the remainder of the paper, we shall discuss only the protocols eDonkey,
BitTorrent, FastTrack and WinMX, because of their popularity and the diversity
of their working processes.
As reported by Karagiannis et al. in [9] and [10], some of P2P traﬃc might use
non-standard port numbers so that we miss some traﬃc by restricting ourselves
to a port analysis. In [12], Sen et al. reported that an identiﬁcation of P2P traﬃc
using application signatures could increase threefold the volume compared to a
port based identiﬁcation. But in this study, we remark that on the one hand,
only Kazaa (using the FastTrack network) has a huge hidden traﬃc, and on the
other hand, eDonkey and BitTorrent peers use mainly standard ports. Indeed,
on the FastTrack network there is no limitation based on the port used by the
P2P application, and some users (in fact many users) might change it. But
on eDonkey network, the peers running their application on non-standard port
receive a Low ID when they connect to an eDonkey server while other peers get
a High ID. The High ID peers have no restrictions while Low ID peers can only
download from High ID peers, so that eDonkey peers are strongly encouraged
not to change the port number of their application. As we shall see, the main part
of P2P traﬃc in France is on eDonkey network, and the port based identiﬁcation
of P2P protocols is relevant in this situation.
3 Characteristics of P2P Traﬃc
Signaling Traﬃc
3.1
P2P traﬃc can be split into two parts:
– the traﬃc generated strictly for downloading data,
– the traﬃc generated for maintaining the network and performing queries,
that we shall denote as signaling traﬃc.
We separate these two kinds of traﬃc according to a threshold of the volume
transmitted by each connection. In Figure 2, we plot the cumulative distribution
function of the volume of connections for each P2P protocol. Note that Figure 2
(a) informs us on the frequency of a connection size, whereas Fig 2 (b) indicates
the percentage of volume generated by the connections.
We choose a threshold of 20 kbytes for signalling traﬃc according to Figure
2 (a). A direct identiﬁcation of signalling connections, as in [14], leads to an
average size of non-download streams of 16.7 kbytes, which is coherent with our
data.
As also observed in [13] and [6], the overwhelming part (more than 90%) of
P2P connections consists of signaling ones whereas they represent only a small
proportion of the volume transferred: eDonkey has the biggest proportion of
volume for signaling traﬃc with 6% (see Figure 2 (b)).

Fig. 2. Volume of P2P Connections
3.2 Upstream Versus Downstream Volumes
User-Based Comparison. In our data, the amount of downstream traﬃc is
larger than the upstream traﬃc in terms of volume for each protocol. It means
that local peers (i.e. several thousands of users) tend to download more than they
upload on our observation point. This is a consequence of ADSL, which tends
to oﬀer much lower outbound than inbound capacity, whereas overall download
and upload rates must be equal in a P2P ﬁle-sharing system .
On Figure 3, we have plotted a cloud of points representing for each eDon-
key user its downstream volume versus its upstream one. On the ﬁgure we can
identify the users contributing to big volumes (on the upper right corner), those
generating small volumes (above the diagonal, in the middle), and a certain num-
ber of peers having no upstream volume whereas they have some downstream
one (to be explained in section 3.6).
We analyze the behavior of these two kinds of users:
– peers having small volume, download ﬁles but upload very few, thus they
can have downstream-to-upstream ratio up to 1000;
– peers contributing to big volumes have comparable upstream and down-
stream volumes with a downstream-to-upstream ratio of about 1.2.
This is the case of eDonkey peers which represents the vast majority of peers,
and other P2P users have similar trends. The ﬁrst class of users share few ﬁles,
or disconnect themselves after download. And the second class of users have to
stay connected to the P2P system for long periods to obtain high downstream
volume, thus they share ﬁles (at least those being downloaded).
By recalling that less than 10% of the users contribute to the most signiﬁcant
part (98%) of the traﬃc (see also [13]), we can see that the non-cooperative
behavior of small volume users doesn’t disturb the balance of P2P system. The

Upstream (Bytes)
Fig. 3. Downstream volume versus upstream volume for each eDonkey peer
downstream-to-upstream ratio for overall P2P traﬃc is about 1.2 over our pool
of users, whereas the mean ratio is of 38.
In our analysis, we identiﬁed that about 20% of the peers are probably free-
riders (i.e. peers that do not share ﬁles) over the eDonkey network.
In [4] and [5], the number of free-riders on Gnutella network is evaluated at
70% and 42% in 2000 and 2001 respectively. Mechanisms like multi-part down-
load (now used by most P2P applications) allow peers to share already down-
loaded ﬁle chunks. This explains the reduction of the number of peers who do
not share data compared to previous studies.
Connection-Based Comparison. Most of the connections bring in a very
small proportion of the volume of each P2P network. Indeed, the connections
transferring less than 100 kbytes represent less than 8% of the traﬃc volume,
whereas they account for more than 90% of the connections (see Figure 2).
We explain this overwhelming number of small connections as follows:
– signalization generates a lot of small transfers,
– many transfers are interrupted,
– many peers attempt to connect to oﬄine peers (see Section 3.6).
For BitTorrent, the distribution of transfer sizes is diﬀerent. BitTorrent gen-
erates a higher proportion of big transfers, indeed there is no search process
included in this protocol, only the coordination of transfers is taken care of.

We have approximated the observed distribution of transfer sizes by classical
statistical laws using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-ﬁt test, and we
conclude that:
– eDonkey can be approximated by a lognormal distribution;
– FastTrack by a lognormal one, but the tails of the distribution (i.e. big
transfers) ﬁts better a Pareto one;
– BitTorrent by a Weibull one.
To conclude this section, we mention that not only is the median volume per
connection very small (less than 1 kbyte) due to numerous small connections, but
so is the median volume per user (10 kbytes). The huge proportion of signaling
traﬃc induces a mean volume per connection of 10 kbytes. On the contrary, due
to some users contributing to large traﬃc volumes, the mean volume per user
per day amounts to 70 Mbytes.
3.3 Connection Duration
We present the cumulative distribution function of the connection duration in
Figure 4.
Connection durations are very long in view of their size. Indeed, more than
85% of the connections stay open for more than 10 seconds while more than 90%
of the connections comprise less than 20 kbytes. This reveals long idle periods
during the connections. These idle periods often encourage authors to consider
