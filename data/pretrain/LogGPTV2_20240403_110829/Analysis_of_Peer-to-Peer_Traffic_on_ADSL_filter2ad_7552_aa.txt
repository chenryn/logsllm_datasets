## Abstract

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications now generate the majority of Internet traffic, particularly for users on Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) due to flat-rate tariffs. This study focuses on four popular P2P systems to characterize their utilization, performance, and evolution. We analyze the influence of each P2.P application on traffic and evaluate the changes in these P2P systems over a year. Our analysis is based on ADSL traffic captured at the TCP level from a Broadband Access Server (BAS) serving thousands of users. We characterize P2P traffic and users, drawing interesting results on connectivity, cooperation between peers, source localization, connection termination, and performance limitations. The traffic evolution over the year provides insights into the dynamics of P2P system usage, including differences between weekdays and weekends.

## 1. Introduction

This study is based on TCP captures from ADSL connections, which are used to establish general characteristics of P2P systems. The focus on ADSL traffic is significant because these users are predominantly present in P2P traffic. ISPs offer 24/7 unlimited connections to ADSL customers, leading to P2P file-sharing systems accounting for more than 60% of total ADSL traffic.

The originality of our measurements lies in:
1. Analyzing all TCP flows from a regional ADSL concentration point.
2. Focusing solely on ADSL traffic (excluding 56k modems), which is more representative of P2P usage.
3. Collecting data from several thousand general ADSL users, not restricted to specific user classes or hosts.

We differentiate P2P users using unique ADSL user identification, as IP address-based analysis can be misleading due to Network Address Translators (NATs) and dynamic IP addresses. We compare four popular P2P networks: eDonkey, BitTorrent, FastTrack, and WinMX.

Our flow-level analysis describes volumetric properties, connection duration, traffic patterns, host connectivity, and geographical location of peers. We map some of these distributions into classical statistical laws. Our packet-level analysis identifies connection beginnings and terminations, leading to findings on performance limitations. Two key results are:
- About 40% of connections are reattempts, affecting about 30% of peers.
- There are two main classes of peers: those contributing significantly to traffic volumes and those with minimal impact.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the measurement methodology. Section 3 elaborates on relevant characteristics of P2P traffic. Section 4 discusses the number of connections established by peers. Section 5 summarizes the main results and concludes the paper.

## 2. Capture Methodology and P2P Overview

### 2.1 Measurement Details

First, we detail our experimentation protocol. As shown in Figure 1, the BAS collects traffic from the DSLAM before forwarding it through the Point-of-Presence (POP) to the France Telecom IP backbone. Our probe is located between the BAS and the IP backbone, capturing all TCP packets without sampling or loss. We analyze traffic over weekdays and weekends in September 2004 and compare these results with data from June 2003.

P2P protocols are identified through port analysis: a connection is classified as P2P if one of its TCP ports is a standard port for that protocol. The accuracy of this method is discussed in Section 2.2.

### 2.2 Overall P2P Overview

In our data, about 60% of the traffic in September 2004 was on P2P ports, a slight drop from the 65% in June 2003. Table 1 shows the distribution of the main P2P protocols over P2P traffic. In September 2004, eDonkey was the most popular protocol in terms of volume, followed by BitTorrent, with other protocols being negligible.

**Table 1. Distribution of Protocol Traffic Over P2P Traffic**

| **Protocol** | **June 2003** | **September 2004** |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
| **eDonkey**  | 84%           | 96%                |
| **BitTorrent** | 0.8%         | 0.009%             |
| **Gnutella** | 0.8%          | 0.9%               |
| **WinMX**    | 1.3%          | 0.06%              |
| **FastTrack** | 12%          | 1.8%               |
| **Other**    | 1.1%          | 1.2%               |

The popularity of P2P file-sharing systems varies by location and time. For example, in October 2003, eDonkey was overwhelmingly popular in Europe, while FastTrack was the most popular in the U.S., followed by WinMX. Over time, FastTrack lost popularity in France.

In the remainder of the paper, we discuss eDonkey, BitTorrent, FastTrack, and WinMX due to their popularity and diverse working processes.

Some P2P traffic might use non-standard ports, leading to missed traffic in port-based analysis. However, eDonkey and BitTorrent peers mainly use standard ports. On the FastTrack network, there are no port limitations, and many users change ports. In contrast, eDonkey peers running on non-standard ports receive a Low ID, limiting their download capabilities. Therefore, port-based identification is relevant for eDonkey, the dominant P2P protocol in France.

## 3. Characteristics of P2P Traffic

### 3.1 Signaling Traffic

P2P traffic can be split into:
- Data downloading traffic
- Signaling traffic for maintaining the network and performing queries

We separate these based on a threshold of 20 kbytes for signaling traffic. Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function of connection volumes for each P2P protocol.

**Figure 2. Volume of P2P Connections**

Over 90% of P2P connections are signaling ones, representing only a small proportion of the transferred volume. eDonkey has the highest proportion of signaling traffic, at 6%.

### 3.2 Upstream Versus Downstream Volumes

#### User-Based Comparison

In our data, downstream traffic is larger than upstream traffic in terms of volume for each protocol. This is due to ADSL offering lower outbound than inbound capacity. Figure 3 shows the relationship between downstream and upstream volumes for eDonkey users.

**Figure 3. Downstream Volume Versus Upstream Volume for Each eDonkey Peer**

We identify two types of users:
- Peers with small volumes, who download but upload very little, with downstream-to-upstream ratios up to 1000.
- Peers with large volumes, who have comparable upstream and downstream volumes, with a ratio of about 1.2.

eDonkey peers represent the majority, and other P2P users follow similar trends. The first class of users share few files or disconnect after downloading. The second class stays connected for long periods, sharing files. Less than 10% of users contribute to 98% of the traffic, indicating that the non-cooperative behavior of small-volume users does not significantly disrupt the P2P system.

#### Connection-Based Comparison

Most connections transfer a very small proportion of the volume. Connections transferring less than 100 kbytes represent less than 8% of the traffic volume but account for more than 90% of the connections. This is due to:
- Signaling generating many small transfers
- Many transfers being interrupted
- Many peers attempting to connect to offline peers

For BitTorrent, the distribution of transfer sizes is different, with a higher proportion of large transfers. We approximate the observed distributions using classical statistical laws:
- eDonkey: Lognormal distribution
- FastTrack: Lognormal distribution, with Pareto tails
- BitTorrent: Weibull distribution

The median volume per connection is very small (less than 1 kbyte), and the median volume per user is 10 kbytes. Due to some users contributing to large volumes, the mean volume per user per day is 70 Mbytes.

### 3.3 Connection Duration

Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution function of connection durations. More than 85% of connections stay open for more than 10 seconds, while more than 90% comprise less than 20 kbytes, indicating long idle periods.
