## Problem
I want to some stable functions provided by `std/fs/mod.ts` without enabling
unstable features, but it does not compile.
## Proposal
Separate unstable part of standard libraries from stable part. For example:
`std/fs/mod.ts` will only include stable functions, `std/fs/unstable/mod.ts`
will include all functions.
