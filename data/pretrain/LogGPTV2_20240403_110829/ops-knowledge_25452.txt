User: I am currently working on a personal project where I have to run two processes simultaneously. The problem is that I have to isolate each of them (they cannot communicate between them or with my system) and I must be able to control their stdin, stdout and stderr. Is there anyway I can achieve this?
Thank you!
Assistant: I don't know if you have an objection to using a 3'rd party communication library for your task but this sounds like what ZeroMQ would be used for.
