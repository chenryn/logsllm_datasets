### Environmental Factors and Their Role

Environmental factors, such as misconfiguration, play a significant role in darknet traffic. While our study confirms the continued influence of these factors, it also highlights an increasing importance of environmental factors, which is a notable addition to the existing body of research.

### Previous Studies on Darknet Traffic

Previous studies have explored various aspects of darknet traffic, including:
- Propagation [22, 1, 2, 3]
- DDoS attacks [4]
- Misconfiguration
- Other unsolicited activities [23]

The most relevant work to this paper is [10], where the authors conducted a detailed analysis of Internet background radiation observed in 2004 across four unused IPv4 network blocks. They performed both active and passive characterizations, concluding that there is significant diversity in the traffic, both in terms of the address blocks monitored and over time.

### Methodological Differences

There are three main distinctions between the previous work and our methodology:
1. **Computation and Storage Infrastructure**: We have access to a large computation and storage infrastructure, allowing us to analyze the full dataset without filtering or sampling.
2. **Active Responders**: Due to the transient and sensitive nature of the blocks being studied, we do not use active responders to solicit traffic. This means we cannot differentiate traffic based on payload, except for UDP.
3. **Data Volume and Scale**: Our study uses substantially larger amounts of data and covers longer time periods than the previous study.

### Methodology

#### 3.1 Data Collection

For our analysis, we used two datasets:
- **Spatial Properties**: Six distinct sub-datasets were constructed by obtaining permission from ARIN and APNIC to announce previously unallocated /8 network blocks via BGP. This resulted in all darknet data destined for these networks being routed to our data collection infrastructure at Merit. The networks 1.0.0.0/8, 50.0.0.0/8, and 107.0.0.0/8 were announced over a one-week period. These datasets were paired with data from the unused portion of the 35.0.0.0/8 network block (96.8% unused) for the same time period. Full packet captures were performed using a customized utility based on libpcap. (See Table 1)
- **Temporal Properties**: Five distinct sub-datasets were extracted from our ongoing continuous data collection of packets directed towards the unused portions of the 35/8 network block. Week-long datasets were extracted for the first week of February each year since 2006. Additional days of data were used to verify the stability of traffic volume and pollution type distribution. (See Table 2)

#### 3.2 Internet Pollution and Data Archiving

Our data collection is part of an ongoing research activity in collaboration with IP address registries like ARIN and APNIC. The goal is to collect and archive samples from newly allocated network blocks for the broader Internet research community. These datasets will be published via the PREDICT [16] dataset archive. To ensure the integrity of the data, we obtain a Letter of Authorization (LOA) from the RIR for each new allocation, outlining the research activity and duration.

### Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Internet Background Radiation

#### 4.1 Temporal Analysis

Figure 2 shows the overall traffic rate observed at the 35/8 darknet during the first week of February for each year from 2006 to 2010. There is a nearly fourfold increase in traffic volume over this five-year period. The traffic rate in 2006 was less than 5 Mbps but had significant spikes reaching up to 60 Mbps, largely due to Windows Messenger popup spam campaigns. The traffic rate increased steadily to almost 20 Mbps by February 2010, representing a 100% growth rate over each of the last four years, which is nearly twice the growth rate of productive Internet traffic (50% year-over-year).

Table 3 shows the relative composition of darknet traffic over time in terms of packets and bytes. A significant increase in UDP traffic was observed in 2008, likely due to an outbreak of the SQL Slammer worm, evidenced by a spike in traffic on UDP port 1434.

#### 4.2 Classification of Internet Background Radiation

Internet background radiation can be classified into three types:
- **Scanning**: Infected hosts searching for vulnerable targets.
- **Backscatter**: Resulting from Denial of Service attacks.
- **Misconfiguration**: Caused by software or hardware errors.

Table 4 shows the contribution of these three types of background radiation to the 1/8, 50/8, 107/8, and 35/8 network blocks. TCP SYN packets are classified as scanning traffic, while backscatter traffic includes TCP SYN+ACK, RST, RST+ACK, and ACK packets. The remaining traffic is classified as misconfiguration. Comparing the /8s to the baseline 35/8, backscatter and scanning volumes are similar, with some variations in misconfiguration traffic due to its directed nature.
