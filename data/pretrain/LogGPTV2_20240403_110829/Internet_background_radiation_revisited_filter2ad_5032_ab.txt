environmental factors such as misconﬁguration. While our
study shows that both of these factors continue to play a
role, the increase in importance of environmental factors is
a striking addition of our study.
The systems described above have led to multiple studies
regarding the nature and characteristics of traﬃc observed
in these darknets. Darknet traﬃc has been used for spe-
ciﬁc analysis of malicious activity such as: propagation [22,
1, 2, 3], DDoS attacks [4], misconﬁguration, or other unso-
licited activity [23]. The most relevant work to this paper, of
course, is [10] in which the authors present an extremely de-
tailed analysis of Internet background radiation as observed
in 2004 at four unused IPv4 network blocks. They performed
both active and passive characterization of the background
traﬃc and concluded that there is signiﬁcant diversity in this
traﬃc both in terms of the address blocks monitored as well
as over time. There are three main distinctions between
this work and the collection methodology in this paper in
addition to the freshness of the data being examined. First,
due to the availability of a large computation and storage
infrastructure, we do not need to ﬁlter or sample the traﬃc
being analyzed in any way (both were done in the previous
work). In spite of the large increases in volume over time,
we ﬁnd fairly robust processing scripts able to process weeks
of data on the order of hours. Second, due to the transient
nature and sensitive nature of the blocks being studied (see
Section 3) we do not utilize any active responders to solicit
traﬃc to the block. As a result, we are unable to diﬀeren-
tiate traﬃc based on payload, except in the cases of UDP.
Finally, we make use of substantially larger amounts of space
and over longer scales than the previous study.
3. METHODOLOGY
In this section we describe the datasets used in our exper-
iments as well as our long term collection methodology for
the study of Internet address space pollution.
3.1 Data Collection
For our analysis we used two datasets. The ﬁrst set of six
distinct sub-datasets we used for studying the spatial prop-
erties of darknet traﬃc, and the second set of ﬁve distinct
sub-datasets was used for studying the temporal properties
of darknet traﬃc.
The six spatial sub-datasets were constructed by obtaining
permission from ARIN and APNIC to announce previously
unallocated /8 network blocks to the Internet via BGP. This
resulted in all darknet data destined for these networks to be
routed to our data collection infrastructure at Merit. Each
of the 1.0.0.0/8, 50.0.0.0/8 and 107.0.0.0/8 networks were
announced over a period of one week. The resulting three
datasets were then paired with data from our ongoing data
collection on the unused portion of the 35.0.0.0/8 network
block for the same time period. The 35.0.0.0/8 network
block is unused except for a /13 block of addresses that is
routed internally at Merit for its customers (96.8% unused).
For each dataset we performed a full packet capture using a
customized packet capture utility based on libpcap. Table 1
lists these datasets.
Though we actively worked with our upstream provider
AT&T to ensure that our BGP route announcements would
be propagated into the Internet core, it is possible that lo-
cal or regional policies and conﬁguration diﬀerences could
have impacted the global visibility of our darknet route an-
nouncements. This in turn would have an impact on what
data is actually routed to our data collectors. Using pub-
licly available BGP routing data from routeviews.org [24]
and RIPE [25] we were able to conﬁrm that our BGP route
announcement for 1.0.0.0/8 was visible to 31 out of 41 ac-
tive routeviews peers and 9 out of 16 active RIPE peers.
The 50.0.0.0/8 route announcement was visible to 31 out
of 41 routeviews peers and 9 out of 14 RIPE peers. The
107.0.0.0/8 BGP route announcement was visible to 28 out
of 41 routeviews peers and 10 out of 16 RIPE peers. Though
we cannot claim to have collected all the network pollution
directed at these network blocks we believe our data is fairly
representative of the overall trends and data patterns.
The second set of ﬁve datasets were used for the tempo-
ral analysis section of this paper and were extracted from
our ongoing continuous data collection of packets directed
towards the unused portions of 35/8 network block. We ex-
tracted week-long datasets for the ﬁrst week of February for
each year since 2006. Table 2 lists these datasets. We used 3
additional days of data for each of the 5 years to verify that
the volume of traﬃc and pollution type distribution was rel-
atively stable throughout the year. From this, we ﬁnd that
our week-long datasets are representative of their respec-
tive years. A total of 11 datasets were created representing
roughly 10TB of compressed packet captures.
3.2 Internet Pollution and Data Archiving
This data collection is a part of an ongoing research ac-
tivity in which we are working with IP address registries
such as ARIN and APNIC in order to collect and archive
samples from newly allocated network blocks for the broad
Internet research community. These datasets will then be
published via PREDICT [16] dataset archive. Any research
activity which interacts with critical Internet infrastructure
must carefully balance the need for informing relevant par-
ties as well as ensuring that such a process does not result
in a dirty dataset. For each new allocation we obtain a clear
Letter of Authorization (LOA) from the RIR whose net-
work block we wish to monitor. This LOA outlines the re-
search activity and the duration for which we are authorized

we investigate background radiation in the context of its
temporal and spacial properties.
4.1 Temporal Analysis of Internet
Background Radiation
Figure 2 shows the overall traﬃc rate observed at the 35/8
darknet during the ﬁrst week of February for each year start-
ing from 2006. There is an almost 4 fold increase in the
observed traﬃc volume to the address space over this 5 year
observation window. While the observed traﬃc rate in 2006
is less than 5Mbps it does have a signiﬁcant number of ex-
tremely large spikes which can reach as high as 60Mbps.
These spikes are largely the result of traﬃc on UDP port
1026, which represents Windows Messenger popup spam
campaigns and are consistent with similar increases in activ-
ity seen in the second half of 2005 and the ﬁrst half of 2006
(e.g., http://www.dshield.org/). 2007 demonstrates only
a modest increase over 2006, but this traﬃc rate increases
steadily to almost 20 Mbps by Feb 2010. This translates
into roughly 100% growth over each of the last four years.
It is interesting to note that this rate of growth is nearly
twice that of productive Internet traﬃc which is currently
exhibiting 50% year over year growth rates [14].
Table 3 shows the relative composition of the darknet traf-
ﬁc over time in terms of packets and bytes. The percentage
of UDP traﬃc increases dramatically in 2008 in terms of
both packets and bytes. It is particularly interesting to note
that there appears to be a signiﬁcant outbreak of SQL Slam-
mer worm scanning in 2008, initially evidenced by the spike
in the volume of traﬃc observed on UDP port 1434. Re-
call that the SQL Slammer worm spread over the course of
Figure 1: Cooperative Internet background radia-
tion data collection
to announce this network block. This is then presented to
our primary upstream provider, AT&T, which then removes
any ﬁlters that would prevent our BGP announcement from
propagating to the Internet. We also take care to publish
information regarding our proposed announcement in the
RADB [26] in the case the network operator community has
some concerns regarding our BGP announcements. We do
not actively announce our experiments on the network op-
erator mailing lists as it might result in tampering with our
data collection; though we are prompt to answer any spe-
ciﬁc queries that might arise as a result of our experiment.
Figure 1 summarizes this process.
4. REVISITING INTERNET
BACKGROUND RADIATION
At a high level, Internet background radiation can be clas-
siﬁed into three distinct types based on diﬀerent root causes
of these activities. Scanning is largely the result of infected
hosts on the Internet attempting to ﬁnd other vulnerable
targets, backscatter is most often the result of Denial of Ser-
vice attacks, and ﬁnally misconﬁguration, which is a result
of software or hardware errors. Table 4 shows the contribu-
tion of the these three main types of background radiation
to each of 1/8, 50/8, 107/8 and 35/8. We classify TCP SYN
packets as scanning traﬃc. We deﬁne backscatter traﬃc as
TCP SYN+ACK, RST, RST+ACK, and ACK packets, as
these packets are likely to be generated by hosts attempting
to respond to communication from a forged source in the
darknet. Finally, we classify the remaining traﬃc as mis-
conﬁguration. When comparing /8s to the baseline 35/8
captured during the same time interval, we observe that
backscatter traﬃc volumes (in billions of packets per week)
are nearly identical. Likewise, scanning is of similar magni-
tudes, despite slightly increased volumes in 50/8 and 107/8.
Misconﬁguration traﬃc contains the most variance between
/8s, due to its directed nature. In the following subsections,
