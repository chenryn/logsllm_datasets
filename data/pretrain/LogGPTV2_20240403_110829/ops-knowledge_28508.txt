User: I am trying to run python script from windows cmd. When I run it under linux I put 
python myscript.py filename??.txt 
it goes through files with numbers from filename01.txt to filename18.txt and it works. 
I tried to run it from cmd like  
python myscript.py filename*.txt 
or
python myscript.py filename**.txt 
but it didnt work. If I tried the script on one single file in windows cmd it works. 
Do you have any clue where the problem could be? 
Thanks!
Assistant: Those wildcards are expanded at "shell (i.e. bash) level" before running your python script.
So the problem doesn't reside in python, but in the "shell" that you are using on Windows.
Probably you cloud try PowerShell for Windows or bash via CygWin.
