### Proxied Traffic and PSQ Flow

The traffic is proxied through the crumple zone, with the exception of PS (Publish-Subscribe) traffic. The PSQ (Publish, Subscribe, Query) flow has been modified. With the addition of four PSQ servers in the four quads, a PSQ request first goes to the Access Proxy (AP). The AP checks whether the traffic belongs to an existing session by consulting the Data Center (DC). If the request is part of an existing session, it is forwarded to the PSQ server. The PSQ server then verifies the signatures and the client's authorization to send the request. If both checks are successful, the request is disseminated to the other quads. Each quad processes the request and sends a signed acknowledgment or response back to the client. The client considers the request complete if it receives a sufficient number of signed responses; otherwise, it continues to resend the request indefinitely. If the PSQ request is a publication, the Information Object (IO) is escrowed. Once the escrow period is over, the IO is released for circulation.

### Evaluating the Defense

To evaluate the effectiveness of the survivability architecture, we adopted a multi-faceted approach. Team members who were not involved in the design and development of the architecture assessed the system using an Integrated Survivability Validation methodology. The validation process and results are detailed in [14]. Based on the attack trees and minimal attacks considered, they found that the defense-enabled system implemented multiple independent layers of defense. Specifically, none of the high-level goals (such as corrupting an IO, stealing an IO, or making the PSQ service unavailable) could be achieved with a single-step attack.

The defense-enabled system underwent numerous fault and intrusion injection tests, where failures and attack effects were simulated or manually induced in various parts of the system to observe the system's reaction and its ability to continue mission operations. In addition to the external Red Team exercise, which involved multiple runs of the mission with the Red Team attacking the system under relatively unrestricted rules of engagement, the system was also subjected to several internal Red Team experiments.

The findings from these evaluation activities showed that the survivability architecture significantly improved the system's survivability, even though several weak points were identified. Causing Loss of Integrity (LOI) or Loss of Control (LOC) was found to be very difficult. Similarly, causing a Loss of Availability (LOA) of the PSQ service in the JBI core was challenging, but the communication infrastructure, especially the connection between the LANs and the public network, was vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

In this section, we summarize a subset of the fault/intrusion injection test cases and attack steps that the defense-enabled system was subjected to. The official results of the external Red Team exercise will be provided by the independent White Team. This paper will only mention some of the attack steps and the Blue Team’s interpretation of events.

### Attack Locations

The sequence of attacker locations indicated in Figure 4 can be thought of as steps in a sustained attack, starting from the public network (location 1) and progressing deeper into the Core zone. For each attack location, a description of the attack step or the injected failure condition/attack effect, and how the system defends against it, is provided in a table format.

### Attack Scenarios

#### Public Network (location 1)

- **Attack Action**: Send traffic to a client VPN router to decrease system availability.
- **Defensive Action**: The VPN Router’s firewall drops non-valid VPN traffic. No reply is sent back. Since the VPN traffic is encrypted, the attacker can only tell that traffic is passing between LANs but cannot decipher the data.

- **Attack Action**: Sniff network traffic.
- **Defensive Action**: The NIDSes do not pick up attack traffic discarded by the VPN routers due to their position behind the routers. Exploitation of an implementation or configuration flaw in the VPN router can be fatal.

#### Client Host (location 2)

- **Attack Action**: Open an SSH session to an AP host.
- **Defensive Action**: One of the Local Controllers (LCs) running on the client host notices this and destroys the SSH session.

- **Attack Action**: Use an existing command-line window to list running LCs and issue a kill command for all three LCs.
- **Defensive Action**: Protection domain policies severely limit what the root user can do, and the kill command has been removed from the system. A special kill command is available for the LCs, but protection domain policies prevent the root user from using it.

- **Attack Action**: Install a custom copy of the kill command.
- **Defensive Action**: SELinux policy (part of the system protection domain) prohibits the installation. As a second line of defense, the LC would remove the file if the attacker manages to install it.

#### Crumple Zone – AP Host (location 3)

- **Attack Action**: Take over a PSQ Proxy by killing the running PSQ proxy and installing a custom version.
- **Defensive Action**: Protection domain policies and adaptive responses mounted by the LC disrupt the attacker’s attempt to become a man-in-the-middle using Q1AP. Policy violation reports and NIDS alerts provide visibility of the attack action. The PSQ protocol tolerates delay and corruption caused at this AP by retransmitting to other quads. Cross-checking among PSQ servers and end-to-end signature checking are also used.

These evaluations and tests demonstrate the robustness of the survivability architecture, highlighting its strengths and areas for improvement.
