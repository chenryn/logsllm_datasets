Question: What are the security implications of Sealed Key Protection (SKP) on an Apple device with an Apple-designed SoC when faced with brute-force attacks or unauthorized operating system manipulations?
"A": "SKP prevents the KEK from being accessed on another medium in the event of brute-force attacks by sealing it with measurements of the system's software.",
"B": "If an attacker modifies measured firmware, software, or security configurations, it leads to a different SMRK value and breaks the seal on the key hierarchy.",
"C": "SKP is supported by the Secure Enclave and prevents manipulation of operating system versions or security settings without appropriate user authorization.",
"D": "SKP ensures that the SMDK is accessible only when the hardware registers' measurements match those of a normal boot, thwarting unauthorized system changes."
