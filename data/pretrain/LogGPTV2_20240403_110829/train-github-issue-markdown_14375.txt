Hello to all,
I facing a problem using the bootstrap affix. It is working fine in desktop
and mobile version, but in mobile version affix is not responding correctly.  
i.e. when you scroll to specific height it is not fixed to the top, after some
time it becomes fixed to top. clearly in mobile or ipad the container is
jumping while scrolling.It is not able to fix to top smoothly.
