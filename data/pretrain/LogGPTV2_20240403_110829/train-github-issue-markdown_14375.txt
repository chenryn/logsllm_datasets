Subject: Issue with Bootstrap Affix on Mobile Devices

Hello everyone,

I am currently experiencing an issue with the Bootstrap affix component. While it functions correctly on the desktop version, there is a problem when using it on mobile devices (including iPads). Specifically, the affix does not respond as expected during scrolling.

The issue is that, upon reaching a certain scroll height, the affix does not immediately fix to the top of the screen. Instead, there is a delay after which it eventually becomes fixed. This results in a noticeable "jump" in the container while scrolling, as the affix is not smoothly transitioning to its fixed position.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate any assistance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
