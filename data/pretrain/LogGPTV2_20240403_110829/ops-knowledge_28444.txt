User: How to configure the IP address and subnet mask of the network interface in the Linux system?
Assistant: The method of configuring the IP address and subnet mask of the network interface in the Linux system: 1. View the network interface information: enter the ifconfig command in the terminal to view the network interface information of the current system. 2. Set the IP address: Use the command "sudo ifconfig <network interface name> <IP address>" to set the IP address of the network interface. For example, to set the IP address of the eth0 interface to 192.168.1.100, you can use the command "sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100". 3. Set the subnet mask: Use the command "sudo ifconfig <network interface name> netmask <subnet mask>" to set the subnet mask of the network interface. For example, to set the subnet mask of the eth0 interface to 255.255.255.0, you can use the command "sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0". 4. Verify the settings: Use the ifconfig command to check the network interface information again to confirm that the configuration has taken effect. It should be noted that the above operations are temporary and will be invalid after the system restarts. To take effect permanently, it needs to be configured in the corresponding configuration file.
