# Observability and Control in Process Systems

## 1. Observability
- **Definition**: The ability to measure the state of a process and maintain situational awareness.
- **Components**:
  - **Visibility**:
    - Monitoring the process (data integrity and availability).
    - Trustworthiness of process measurements (data veracity).
  - **Sufficiency**:
    - Measurement of all required process parameters at the appropriate locations.
    - Ability to interpret the measurements accurately.
  - **Feasibility**:
    - Ensuring the process is in a controllable state.
    - Having a control sequence that can bring the process into an intended state.
  - **Awareness**:
    - Knowledge of the sequence of control commands by the operator.
    - Ability to bring the process into a desired state.
    - Ensuring the plant can achieve acceptable operations.

## 2. Security Properties of Process Control
- **Resilience**:
  - Maintaining optimal operations under attack.
- **Survivability**:
  - Maintaining operations under attack, albeit at a suboptimal level.
- **Graceful Degradation**:
  - Maintaining limited plant functionality to achieve a safe shutdown.

### Example: Chemical Reaction in a Pipe
If an attacker moves unreacted chemicals from the reactor into the pipe, the pipe can burst due to rapidly increased pressure caused by the continuing chemical reaction. If the only measurement available at this particular pipe location is flow, the operator will remain unaware of the unsafe situation until it might be too late. This insufficiency in measurements can lead to an uncontrollable process, as there may be no control action to decrease the pressure and prevent the pipe from bursting.

The importance of controllability and observability in detecting and reacting to unwanted events is particularly critical in water distribution systems [13]. Identifying and removing process bottlenecks (e.g., small valves incapable of compensating for rapid changes in process state) improves process operability. For instance, the increase in pressure will propagate downstream and eventually become visible in other measurements, but detection might occur too late for corrective actions.

## 3. Potential Applications
- **Network Segmentation**: Resilience-aware network segmentation can significantly improve the tolerance period, giving operators more time to intervene [18].
- **Education**: DVCP (Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process) can be used during security training to illustrate process control concepts and attack strategies. For example, attendees can learn how to recognize plant weaknesses from process documentation (e.g., Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams). A combination of a valve and a pump is a good candidate for a water hammer attack. Further study of process specifications can determine whether there is potential for an attacker to exploit identified process weaknesses (e.g., a thin pipe or a slow valve that could cause dangerous pressure transients).

## 4. Conclusion
In cyber-physical system security, the focus is on attacks that cause physical impact. Cyber attackers must find ways to manipulate physical processes, often by obtaining sensor readings, manipulating sensor measurements sent to controllers, and altering instructions sent to actuators. Understanding the physical part of the target is crucial for the attacker, who may be impeded by automatic safety measures and lack of real-time observations.

A successful attack involves several stages, some of which can be performed in parallel, some repeatedly, and some requiring expertise in the physical aspects of the system. We demonstrated this approach using a simulation of a vinyl acetate monomer plant, highlighting the detours an attacker might take to achieve their goal. Analyzing these hurdles helps in understanding what the attacker needs to do and why, which is useful for eliminating low-hanging fruits and making exploitation harder. Studying maliciously manipulated processes enables operators to discover design weaknesses and defenders to identify additional controls that can increase the resilience of physical processes to cyber assaults.
