data trustworthiness). If the attacker manages to move unreacted chemicals from the reactor
into the pipe, the pipe can burst because of rapidly increased pressure caused by continuing
chemical reaction. If the only measurement available at this particular pipe location is ﬂow,
the operator will remain unaware of unsafe situation (insufﬁcient measurements) until it is
might be too late9 and the process becomes uncontrollable (there is no control action which
could decrease the pressure and prevent pipe burst). The importance of controlability and
observability for detecting and reacting to unwanted events is especially taken seriously in
water distribution ﬁeld [13]. Finding and removing process bottlenecks (e.g. small valve
incapable to compensate for rapid change in process state) improves process operability. One
9The increase in pressure will propagate downstream and eventually will be visible in other measurements. However,
the detection might happen too late for taking correcting actions.
7.3 Potential applications

of the approaches to improve the survivability of physical processes under cyber-attacks is
resilience-aware network segmentation. As shown in [18] such network design can signiﬁ-
cantly improve the tolerance period that would give operator more time to intervene. This
is a hybrid strategy when control and network conﬁgurations can be beneﬁcially considered
jointly.
• Education. DVCP can be used during the security trainings to illustrate any of the process
control concepts and attack strategies described in this paper. E.g. attendees can be tough how
to recognize plant weaknesses from process documentation (e.g. Piping and Instrumentation
Diagram). E.g. a combination of a valve and a pump is a good candidate for water hammer
attack. It is possible to further study process speciﬁcation to determine whether there is a
potential for the attacker to practically exploit the identiﬁed process weakness (the pipe might
be too thin and/or the valve to slow which won’t allow an attacker to invoke dangerous pressure
transient).

8. Conclusion
In cyber-physical systems security we are concerned speciﬁcally with attacks that cause physical
impact. To do so, the attacker has to ﬁnd ways of manipulating the physical processes in the system.
Cyber attacks on process networks may allow the attacker to obtain sensor readings, to manipulate
sensor measurements sent to controllers and instructions sent to actuators. To appreciate the effect of
such manipulations the attacker has to understand the physical part of her target. The attacker may
be impeded by automatic safety measures and may not have access to observations that allow her to
monitor the effect of her actions.
The construction of a successful attack has to go through several stages, some can be performed
in parallel, some will be performed repeatedly, and some will require expertise on the physical part
of the cyber-physical system, an expertise not commonly found in the IT security community.
We have demonstrated this approach in the example of a simulation of a vinyl acetate monomer
plant to give some glimpses on the detours an attacker may have to take to reach her goal. Studying
the hurdles the attacker has to overcome allows to understand what she needs to do and why. This
knowledge useful for eliminating low hanging fruits and making exploitation harder. Analyzing
processes when maliciously manipulated enables process operators to discover the weaknesses of a
process design in the presence of cyber attacks. The defenders in turn gain insights which additional
controls might increase the resilience of physical processes to cyber assaults.
