User: I have created the number of schedulers using python in windows which are running in background.
Can anyone tell me any command to check how many schedulers running on windows and also how can I remove them?
Assistant: All your schedulers are part of your a single Python process, then you won't be able to count the the individual timers which are scheduled. As the python schedulers are something you write, you can choose to keep a file which would be updated periodically.
If each scheduler is a separate python process, then count the many python processes from your Windows task manager.
