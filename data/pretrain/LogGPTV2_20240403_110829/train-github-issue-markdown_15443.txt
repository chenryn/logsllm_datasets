**Electron Version:** v1.3.2  
**Operating System:** Windows 10

Hello,

I used the "depends.exe" tool to inspect the Electron dependencies and did not find `msvcp140.dll`. I then updated Electron to the latest version, but still could not locate `msvcp140.dll`. However, my Electron application runs normally, and I am unsure of the reason behind this.

I reviewed the following GitHub link, which indicates that Electron depends on `msvcp140.dll`:
- [GitHub Pull Request #5538](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/5538/files)

Could you please clarify why `msvcp140.dll` is not listed in the dependencies, yet my application functions without issues?

Thank you very much.
