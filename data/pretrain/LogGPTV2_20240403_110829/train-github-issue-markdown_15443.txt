  * Electron version: v1.3.2
  * Operating system: win10
hello dear:  
I use the "depends.exe" tool to view the electron, I did not find the
dependent msvcp140.dll. I update electron to the latest. Also found no
msvcp140.dll,But my electron application can run normally, I don't know what's
the reason.  
I opened this link and found electron dependent msvcp140.dllã€‚  
https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/5538/files  
I want to make it clear.
thanks very much
