How do I change the printer tray programmatically?
I am trying to use python to batch print some PDFs.  I need to print different pages from different trays.  The printer is a Ricoh 2232C.  Is there a way to do it through and Acrobat Reader command line parameter?  I am able to use the Win32 api to find out which bins correspond to which binnames, but that is about it.  Any advice/shortcuts/etc?
Assistant: That's not possible using plain PDF, as you have create new print job for any particular bin and tray combination (and not all printers allow you to do that, Xerox 4x and DP Series allows you to do such things).
My best bet would be juggling with PostScript: convert PDF to PostScript, where you have access to individual pages, then extract the pages you need and for each such page (or pages) create new print job (eg. using Windows program lpr). To ease the task, I'd create print queue for any combination of bin and tray you have to print to, then use these queues as printers.
