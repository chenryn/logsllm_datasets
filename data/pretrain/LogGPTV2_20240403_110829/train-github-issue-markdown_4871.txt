html markup' after the discussion

Hello,  
I know that the question has been asked before about the possible support for
rendering html content simirarly as the native platforms do, and that the
answer was that it wasn't planned: #25 #7311
But I've also seen the comment by @DaveShuckerow from Dec 2017
https://github.com/flutter/flutter_markdown/issues/19#issuecomment-350358715
that there is a plan to release a widget that is being used and developed
internally at Google.
Being able to show html content is a critical part of our small project now
and we don't really have the resources to develop this on our own.  
So I would like to ask whether it would be possible for you guys to make that
widget available in it's current state? Like a preview version, or even just a
gist that we could use clearly at our own risk without any guarantees. It
would be a big help for us.
(If you didn't want to publish it publicly yet, but maybe can send it in
private, my email is: edit: removed)
Thanks for any response in advance
