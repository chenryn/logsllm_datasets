It's an incredibly simple feature, but _sooo_ useful. I've had a utility
installed to do this for a few years now and I never go on a new windows
install without it. When I use other people's PCs as well, I really miss the
ability to keep a specific window in front.
**How it works:**
As I have it at the moment, pressing Ctrl+Space on any desktop window will
toggle the always on top state of that window. When that's done, they
effectively stay in front, even when focus changes to another window after
that.
**What it's for:**
Doing that allows me to put some content I want to see (a video, browser tab,
some instructions, or notes) on my display whilst I work/type into a different
window.
When I'm done I just focus my pinned window and use Ctrl+Space to return it to
normal.
**What I'd change:**
Admittedly, the Ctrl+Space key combination is sometimes problematic when
gaming, where I might need the same combination for something else. That's why
I suggest changing it to some combination with the Win key instead.
Win+Space is (annoying) used to switch keyboard layouts, so it might have to
become something like Win+Alt instead.
It would also help, though, to allow the user to configure the shortcut, as
well as a visible button to pin/unpin windows similar to the "Maximize to new
desktop widget".
