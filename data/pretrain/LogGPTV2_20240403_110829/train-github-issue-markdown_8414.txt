I ran into a bug today where including angular2.min.js would result in my code
failing but using angular2.js would run fine.
Example plunkr here: http://plnkr.co/edit/599t9vXIoDWvERnvCTWu?p=preview
In it's current state the [(ngModel)] bind fails so the text box gets no data,
but if you switch the page to load angular2.js instead of angular2.min.js the
text box will load just fine.
