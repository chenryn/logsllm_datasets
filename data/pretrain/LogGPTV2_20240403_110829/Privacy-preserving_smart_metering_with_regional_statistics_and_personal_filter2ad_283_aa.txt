Privacy Preserving Smart Meter Streaming against Information
Leakage of Appliance Status
Yuan Hong, Member, IEEE, Wen Ming Liu, and Lingyu Wang, Member, IEEE
The smart grid frequently collects consumers’ ﬁne-grained power usage data through smart meters to facilitate various applications
such as billing, load monitoring, regional statistics, and demand response. However, the smart meter reading streams may also pose
severe privacy threats to the consumers by leaking their appliances’ ON/OFF status. In this paper, we ﬁrst quantitatively measure
the information leakage w.r.t. speciﬁc appliances’ status from any reading stream, and deﬁne a novel privacy notion to bound such
information leakage. In addition, we propose a privacy preserving streaming algorithm with different options to effectively convert
readings and promptly stream safe readings in different fashions. The output time series readings satisfy our privacy notion while
guaranteeing excellent utility, such as extremely low aggregation errors and billing errors. Finally, we experimentally validate the
effectiveness and efﬁciency of our approach using real datasets.

I. INTRODUCTION
The smart grid integrates sensors and communication net-
works into the existing power grid to ubiquitously collect data
from the grid for operational intelligence [14]. As a critical
component in such an infrastructure, smart meters frequently
transmit ﬁne-grained readings to the electric utility, e.g., a
reading every 15 minutes [27]. Such reading streams greatly
beneﬁt the utilities (e.g., load balancing) as well as the energy
consumers (e.g., optimizing electricity usage) [13]. However,
some recent studies show that such features may also lead
to serious breaches of consumers’ privacy [4], [7]. The ﬁne-
grained meter readings could potentially reveal the consumers’
personal daily behavior or habits, e.g., cooking time (by the
stove or microwave), and frequency of going to the bathroom
at night (by the light switched on).
To prevent adversaries from compromising energy con-
sumers’ personal privacy, three major categories of privacy
preserving techniques were proposed. First, some existing
approaches (e.g., [4]) inject tolerable noise into the original
or aggregated meter readings. However, they trade off some
output utility for desired privacy and may not be able to ensure
high aggregation and billing accuracy due to the random
noise. Second, some approaches (e.g., [30]) encrypt the meter
readings with cryptographic primitives and only report the
temporally or geographically aggregated data for speciﬁc ap-
plications (e.g., billing [12], regional statistics [7]). However,
without reporting the ﬁne-grained readings, the output cannot
support many real world smart grid applications (e.g., load
monitoring [15]). Finally, some approaches (e.g., [37]) attach
batteries for households to mask the meter readings. However,
they may require expensive devices or facilities to support the
scheme and thus result in high cost for both implementation
and maintenance.

More importantly, the privacy models in most of the existing
solutions (e.g., [30], [7], [37]) only consider all the ﬁne-
grained meter readings (viz. a series of numbers) as sensitive
data and simply aim to anonymize such “numbers”. To the best
of our knowledge, the privacy risks in terms of “appliances’
ON/OFF status at different times” (which directly reﬂects the
privacy concerns of energy consumers) has not been formally
deﬁned and quantiﬁed in literature. Speciﬁcally, the following
are unclear in most of the prior privacy models: (1) which
reading is sensitive and vulnerable? (2) how much information
related to the appliance status can be leaked from the readings?
and (3) what kind of background knowledge can be utilized
to identify the appliance status from the reading streams?
To tackle such issues,
in this paper, we investigate the
privacy risks by linking the meter readings to appliances’
ON/OFF status at different times, and formally deﬁne a privacy
notion (denoted as (ǫ, δm)-Uncertainty) to quantify and bound
such threats of information leakage in any reading stream.
Different from most of the prior work, we propose an efﬁ-
cient privacy preserving algorithm to stream output readings
without any aggregation while guaranteeing rigorous privacy
and excellent utility. Therefore, the outputs can support most
smart metering services, e.g., billing [12], regional statistics
[7], and load monitoring [15], and such outputs can also be
fed into the aggregation-based solutions when necessary.
Motivating Example. Table I presents a set of sample time
series readings, and Table II shows the electric appliances and
the labeled consumption rates in watts for a household [1].
In real world, the adversaries can obtain the readings and
possess the background knowledge of common appliances’
consumption rates. From the ﬁrst reading 0.08kWh (in 0.1
hour), he/she can learn the overall consumption rate as
800watts. Then, with the background knowledge in Table II,
the adversary can learn that exactly one of the following
possibilities may occur: (1) microwave (800watts) is ON, (2)
PC, light, vacuum cleaner, TV and stereo system (800watts in
total) are ON, or (3) other combinations of appliances with
overall consumption rate 800watts. Moreover, looking at the
reading time 6:30pm, he/she can infer that microwave is highly

likely to be ON due to the cooking time.
Second, at 7:30pm, consumption rate 1300watts can be
learned. Thus, dishwasher is likely to be ON at 7:30pm (due
to 1300watts). In reality, a sequential usage pattern of two
appliances “microwave → dishwasher” (washing the dishes
after dinner) could help the adversary conﬁrm that dishwasher
is ON at 7:30pm. Similarly, TV and stereo system might be
ON at 8:00pm due to the TV’s temporal usage pattern, as
well as the correlation between TV and stereo system to be
ON simultaneously (can be known as background knowledge).
Third, besides the consumption rate/time, some appliances
also have their unique signatures on the length of usage. Then,
adversaries can also utilize it to learn the status of different
appliances. For instance, washer is likely to be ON at 8:06pm
(due to 1500watts) and it is also likely to be ON at 8:12pm
(due to 1700watts). Then, the adversary can conﬁrm that the
washer is extremely likely to ON at both times due to a
common background knowledge that washer runs continuously
for at least 30 minutes in general.

In this paper, we will investigate a set of possible infor-
mation leakage to breach the consumers’ privacy from smart
meter reading streams, and deﬁne a novel privacy notion to
quantify and bound such risks. Then, the primary contributions
of this paper are summarized as below:
• We deﬁne a novel privacy notion to quantify and bound
the privacy leakage w.r.t. the readings’ actual implications
on speciﬁc appliances’ ON/OFF status.
• We propose an efﬁcient privacy preserving streaming
algorithm with different options to effectively convert
readings and promptly stream safe readings with excellent
output utility, e.g., negligible aggregation/billing errors.
• We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of
our streaming algorithm on real datasets and provide case
studies for real-life households.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
ﬁrst reviews the related work. Section III formally deﬁnes
some models. In Section IV, we present our privacy preserving
streaming algorithm. Then, we give analysis on privacy, com-
plexity and implementation in Section V. Section VI presents
the experimental results, and Section VII summarizes some
limitations and challenges. Finally, we draw the concluding
remarks and discuss the future work in Section VIII.
In the past decade, various privacy models were proposed
to bound the privacy risks of identifying any individual or
associating any individual with the sensitive values in many
different datasets, such as k-anonymity [36] for anonymizing
tabular data, and ρ-uncertainty [6] for preventing inferences
in transaction data. Furthermore, differential privacy [11] has
been extended to tackle the privacy concerns in many different
contexts based on randomizations, such as recommender [23],
search queries [21], [16], [18] and smart metering [4].
Recently, privacy-preserving techniques have been devel-
oped for mitigating privacy risks in ﬁne-grained meter readings
[4], [29], [31]. For instance, Rottondi et al. [29] presented
a secure communication protocol which allows utilities to
securely aggregate smart meter readings. Ács and Castelluccia
[4] proposed a differentially private scheme that enables smart
meters to periodically report data to power suppliers and
compute aggregated statistics with rigorous privacy guarantee.
In addition, Shi et al. [33] proposed a differentially private
randomization based aggregation of distributed time series
data (e.g., readings collected from multiple smart meters) with
differential privacy guarantee. Different from the noise based
data perturbation (e.g., state-dependent perturbation [38]),
our privacy preserving streaming algorithm does not report
probabilistic results, which can reduce errors and variance in
general. In the context of smart metering aggregation and
perturbation, more recently, Savi et al. [32] quantitatively
analyzed a tradeoff between the aggregation set size,
the
precision on the aggregated measurements, and the privacy.
Finally, renewable energy sources (e.g., battery) can be utilized
to mask the original meter readings of households as well [37].
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). In some NILM
algorithms [8], [9], [26], [25], privacy concerns have been
identiﬁed since the NILM algorithms estimate the speciﬁc ap-
pliances’ energy consumption at different times in households,
e.g., [8], [9], [26]. However, such NILM algorithms cannot
provide an upper bound for the probabilities of disaggregation
(this was also indicated in [10]). Then, the privacy enhancing
techniques extended from NILM algorithms (e.g., [26]) cannot
quantify and bound the risks with theoretical guarantee of
privacy. Instead, in this paper, the privacy leaking risks can
be quantiﬁed, and can be bounded with our deﬁned privacy
notion to provide theoretical guarantee of privacy. Notice that,
among the NILM studies, Dong et al. [10] have learned the
upper bounds on the probabilities of distinguishing between
scenarios of appliance usage based on the energy consump-
tion distribution (which was missing in most of the NILM
algorithms). However, in such work, privacy notions are not
deﬁned to quantify the privacy risks, and there does not exist
a privacy preserving algorithm to output safe readings based
on the derived upper bounds either.

A. Preliminary Models
We denote a smart meter’s associated appliance set as
A = {a1, . . . , a|A|}, where |A| is the number of appliances
(how smart meter populates and maintains its appliance set
A is discussed in Section V-C). We use |a1|, . . . , |a|A|| to
represent their labeled consumption rates. In addition, we
deﬁne reading frequency as φ: the time interval between two
consecutive readings (e.g., 15 minutes). The readings can be
converted into consumption rates, and vice-versa.
Given an appliance set A and the consumption rate of
each appliance in A, we ﬁrst deﬁne a function to calculate
the overall consumption rate of any subset of A (which is a
combination of appliances).
Deﬁnition 1 (Consumption Rate Function h(·)): Given any
subset of an appliance set A: ∀E ⊆ A, function h(·) is
deﬁned to calculate the overall consumption rate of all the
appliances in E: h(E) = P∀ax∈E |ax|, where |ax| denotes
ax’s consumption rate.
Then, h(·) can be used to calculate the unique consumption
rates of all the subsets of A, which are denoted as:
Deﬁnition 2 (Candidate Rate Set G): Given the power set
2A of an appliance set A, the set of unique consumption rates:
G = {h(E) : ∀E ⊆ 2A}
(1)
where E is a subset of A.
As a result, for any consumption rate ω ∈ G, we can ﬁnd
all the subsets of A whose consumption rate equals ω by
traversing 2A. We consider such process as a function:
Deﬁnition 3 (Candidate Appliance Set Function c(·)): Given
any consumption rate ω ∈ G, function c(·) is deﬁned as
c(ω) = {E : E ⊆ 2A, h(E) = ω}
(2)
B. Privacy Leakage
In this paper, we look at the case that each appliance is either
completely “ON” or completely “OFF” between two adjacent
readings (which occurs very often in the reading stream due
to short time intervals). Indeed, this is the worst case of
leaking consumers’ privacy since the overall consumption rate
in that time interval (e.g., 15 minutes) accurately reﬂects all
the appliances which are “ON”.
1) Leakage in a Single Reading
The “ON/OFF” status of any appliance can be possibly
leaked from a single reading which includes the consumption
amount/rate and consumption time.
Consumption Rate. Denoting the size of ω’s candidate appli-
ance set c(ω) as |c(ω)|, we can represent c(ω) as {c(ω)1,
c(ω)2, . . . , c(ω)|c(ω)|}. Since there are |c(ω)| combinations
of appliances that would lead to the consumption rate ω,
adversaries can enumerate all the entries in c(ω) and infer
a view for all the possible combinations of appliances {c(ω)1,
c(ω)2, . . . , c(ω)|c(ω)|}. Indeed, in such view, each combination
of appliances ∀y ∈ [1, |c(ω)|] can have a probability Py such
that P|c(ω)|
y=1 Py = 1. We can quantify the information leakage
in the adversary’s view using their Entropy [34]:
H(c(ω)) = −
|c(ω)|
(Py log Py)
X
y=1
(3)
Therefore, the maximum information leakage occurs in case
that P1 = P2 = · · · = P|c(ω)| (maximum entropy). In other
words, among all the possible inferences in the adversary’s
view, P1 = P2 = · · · = P|c(ω)| would result in (house-
holds’) maximum privacy leakage (viz. adversary’s maximum
information gain) from the consumption rate ω. Then, given
a reading r = ωφ, adversaries can have the maximum privacy
leaking view which is P1 = P2 = · · · = P|c(ω)| = 1
|c(ω)| for
each of the possible combinations of appliances with overall
consumption rate ω.
As a result, the information leakage w.r.t. “any appliance ax
is ON” can be quantiﬁed from all the possible combinations
(entries in the candidate appliance set c(ω)): ∀y ∈ [1, |c(ω)|],
is
if appliance ax is in the appliance set c(ω)y, then
added into the overall information leakage. Thus, given the
consumption rate ω, the information leakage w.r.t. “appliance
ax is ON” can be represented as:
|c(ω)|
1
I[ω → ax] =
|c(ω)|
X
y=1
Ixy
|c(ω)|
∈ [0, 1]
(4)
where ∀y ∈ [1, |c(ω)|], Ixy ∈ {0, 1} and if ax ∈ c(ω)y then
Ixy = 1; otherwise Ixy = 0.
Consumption Time. Besides the consumption rate, since
many appliances may have temporal usage patterns, the times-
tamp of a reading can also be exploited by adversaries to
further identify appliances’ “ON/OFF” status at that time.
For instance, microwave might be “ON” with a very high
probability at 6pm, and TV is very likely to be “ON” between
7-9pm. Note that the temporal usage patterns can be readily
estimated by the adversaries via exterior knowledge, e.g., the
power usage of most households, weather conditions, and other
public resources. Then, we also use the [0,1] range to measure
such information leakage where 0 represents “impossible to be
ON” whereas 1 means “impossible to be OFF” (note that it
refers to the likelihood of using a certain appliance at a speciﬁc
time by most households, which can be simply estimated by
everyone). Then, the adversary can envision a view of the
information leakage of all the appliances’ status (based on how
JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015
4
likely each appliance is ON at different time). For instance,
I[3am → M icrowave] = 0.02, I[8pm → T V ] = 0.3. Thus,
given a consumption time t, the information leakage w.r.t.
“appliance ax is ON” can be represented as:
I[t → ax] ∈ [0, 1]
(5)
Information Leakage Quantiﬁcation. We then measure the
information leakage w.r.t. “an appliance is ON” from a read-
ing, which discloses to the adversaries the overall consumption
rate ω and time t.
