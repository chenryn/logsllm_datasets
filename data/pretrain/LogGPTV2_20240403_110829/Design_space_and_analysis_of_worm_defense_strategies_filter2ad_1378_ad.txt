Figure 5: Infection Factor Figures a-f show both the non-participation infection factor (NPIF) and partici-
pation infection factor (PIF) for CodeRed and Slammer random scanning worms.
6.2 Hit-list Brute-force Worms
6.2.2 Hybrid defense
We analyze the eﬀectiveness of each strategy against brute-
force worms using a hit-list instead of random scanning. A
hit-list worm knows all vulnerable hosts a priori and only
scans those hosts appearing on the hit-list. Since infection is
only attempted on vulnerable hosts, hit-list worms are one
of the hardest to control [27]. Note that we combine the hit-
list worm with the collaborative brute-force worm described
in section 6.1 to make an even more aggressive worm against
Proactive Protection.
6.2.1 Individual defense
Figure 8 shows the eﬀectiveness of each individual strategy
against a hit-list version of the brute-force Slammer and
brute-force CodeRed worms, i.e., we use the same scanning
rate as the Slammer and CodeRed worms except that all
scan attempts in the hit-list version will reach vulnerable
hosts.
Reactive Antibody Defense and Reactive Address Black-
listing strategies have little eﬀect for both hit-list worms
because the infection rate is faster than the reaction time
values (δa and δb) we picked.
Due to the fast propagation speed of hit-list worms, im-
plementations of these two strategies are not likely to pro-
vide fast enough reaction time to be eﬀective against hit-list
worms. Local Containment is also ineﬀective overall.
In this experiment, Proactive Protection clearly does the
best job at controlling both worms. With CodeRed, Proac-
tive Protection controls the worm with even small deploy-
ment factors for the time period measured (note there is a
slight upward slope that would continue until 100% were
infected), and further maintains a near-zero percent infec-
tion with 100% deployment for the entire time period mea-
sured. With Slammer, Proactive Protection delays infection
for hosts much more substantially than the other defense
approaches.
Figure 9 presents brute-force Slammer worm using hit-list
scanning for Proactive Protection hybrid defenses. To see
the inﬂuence of the synergy, we change the reaction time of
Reactive Antibody Defense (δa) to be 30 seconds, instead of
the previous 60 seconds. The reaction time of Reactive Ad-
dress Blacklisting (δb) remains 30 seconds. We do not show
other defenses because the exact graph is too dependent on
the speciﬁc parameter choices to be meaningful.
