# Environment
Windows 10.0.18363.836  
PowerToys v0.18.0  
PowerToys run module
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Alt+Space
  2. Type in "notepad++"
Note that this is not an _installed_ application, but the notepad++.exe file
is available through the PATH environment variable
  3. Observe that nothing appears
  4. Hit Esc
  5. Win+R
  6. Type in "notepad++"
  7. Hit Enter
  8. Observe that Notepad++ starts
  9. Quit Notepad++
  10. Win (start menu)
  11. Type in "notepad++"
  12. Observe that "notepad++" shows up under Command with the right icon
  13. Select notepad++ and hit Enter
  14. Observe that Notepad++ starts
# Expected behavior
PowerToys Run finds notepad++.exe through the PATH environment variable
# Actual behavior
It does not find it.
I have also verified with about a dozen other .exe files, all available
through the PATH environment variable, all found through start menu or with
Win+R but not through PowerToys run.
Perhaps my expectation is at fault?
