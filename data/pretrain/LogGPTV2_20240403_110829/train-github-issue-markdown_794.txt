BottomNavigation throws an error if one child is null.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Since inline if with logical && operator
(https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--
operator) is a popular technique to achieve conditional rendering, I think
that BottomNavigation should support this, instead of throwing an error.
I think this could be achieved by filtering out children that are null at
https://github.com/callemall/material-
ui/blob/v1-beta/src/BottomNavigation/BottomNavigation.js#L66 before mapping
them.
## Current Behavior
BottomNavigation throws an error if one child is null, such as is the case
with inline if with logical && operator for conditional rendering.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
                      {
                        condition &&
                      }
  1.   2.   3.   4. 
## Context
I'm using conditional rendering to show select options in the bottom
navigation.
