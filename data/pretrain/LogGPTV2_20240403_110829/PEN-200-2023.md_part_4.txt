### Overview of Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK)

#### Introduction

In the realm of penetration testing, the primary challenge often lies in the unknown. If we had complete knowledge about a target, compromising it would be a straightforward task. This principle underpins the design of the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK) course, which aims to teach both technical skills and a methodological approach to handling uncertainty.

#### Course Structure and Learning Objectives

PWK is structured to teach two sets of skills:
1. **Penetration Testing Techniques**: Explicitly covered through the Modules' Learning Objectives.
2. **Methodology, Approach, and Attitude**: Implicitly taught through the course structure and exercises.

The explicit skills include gathering information, exploiting perimeter defenses, escalating privileges, moving laterally between machines, and pivoting to other networks. These are detailed in the PWK Modules.

The implicit skills, which are arguably more important, involve developing a framework for thinking, feeling, and acting in novel scenarios. This is crucial because penetration testing often involves dealing with uncertainty.

#### Learning Modalities

PWK includes seven learning modalities, each designed to progressively increase the level of uncertainty:

1. **Learning Modules**
2. **Demonstration Module Exercises**
3. **Application Module Exercises**
4. **Capstone Module Exercises**
5. **Assembling the Pieces Module**
6. **Challenge Labs (Type One)**
7. **Challenge Labs (Type Two)**

These modalities can be seen as points along a spectrum, where the learner's uncertainty increases as they progress through the course.

#### Detailed Breakdown of Learning Modalities

##### 2.2.2 Learning Modules
- **Content**: Each module covers specific penetration testing concepts, techniques, and skills. They are approximately 30-50 pages long and are accompanied by videos that provide visual and interactive explanations.
- **Order**: The modules are logically ordered to build on previously learned skills.
- **Uncertainty Level**: Low, as the learner only needs to read or watch the content. However, active engagement (e.g., following along with lab machines) is encouraged to internalize the material.

##### 2.2.3 Demonstration Module Exercises
- **Objective**: To absorb the content by following the demonstration.
- **Type of Exercise**: Factual, knowledge-based questions or obtaining a randomized flag by copying commands and input from the course material.
- **Uncertainty Level**: Very low, as the solution can be directly obtained from the module.

##### 2.2.4 Application Module Exercises
- **Objective**: To apply skills in novel but limited scenarios.
- **Example**: A modified machine requires the learner to adapt the techniques learned in the demonstration.
- **Uncertainty Level**: Slightly higher, as the learner must adapt to new situations.

##### 2.2.5 Capstone Module Exercises
- **Scope**: Encompasses the entire module, increasing the level of uncertainty.
- **Example**: Attacking a specific machine using one of the client-side attacks, but without clear guidance on which attack to use.
- **Purpose**: To provide opportunities to hack machines from start to finish under constrained parameters.

##### 2.2.6 Assembling the Pieces
- **Process**:
  1. Reading and watching the module.
  2. Completing demonstration exercises.
  3. Working through application exercises.
  4. Attacking machines via capstone exercises.
- **Bridge**: Serves as a transition to the Challenge Labs, providing a full walkthrough of a small penetration test.

##### 2.2.7 Challenge Labs 1-3
- **Type**: Scenarios involving networked machines and a background story.
- **Goal**: Obtain access to a Domain Administrator account and compromise as many machines as possible.
- **Uncertainty Level**: High, as the learner must determine which machines are vulnerable and how to exploit them.

##### 2.2.8 Challenge Labs 4-6
- **Type**: OSCP-like experience with six OSCP machines.
- **Composition**: Three Active Directory-connected machines and three standalone machines.
- **Purpose**: Provide a mock-exam experience similar to the actual OSCP exam.
- **Point System**: Standalone machines are worth 20 points each, and the Active Directory set is worth 40 points in total.

#### Summary of PWK Learning Modules

##### 2.3.1 Getting Started: Optional Ramp-up Modules
- **Introduction to Cybersecurity**: Provides a broad survey of the cybersecurity landscape.
- **Effective Learning Strategies**: Explains OffSec’s unique approach to teaching and provides practical steps for learners.
- **Report Writing for Penetration Testers**: Offers a framework and tips for writing penetration testing reports.

##### 2.3.2 Enumeration and Information Gathering
- **Focus**: Techniques for approaching a network and gathering information.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Methods to identify vulnerable machines and narrow the scope of an engagement.

##### 2.3.3 Web Application and Client-Side Attacks
- **Web Application Attacks**: Covers common vulnerabilities such as XSS, Directory Traversal, File Inclusion, File Upload, and Command Injection.
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Teaches how to exploit interactions between web servers and databases.
- **Client-Side Attacks**: Techniques for reconnaissance and attacking users of common programs like Microsoft Office.

##### 2.3.4 Other Perimeter Attacks
- **Public Exploits and Fixing Exploits**: Using and adapting existing exploits.
- **Anti Virus Evasion**: Basic knowledge of avoiding antivirus detection.
- **Cryptography and Password Attacks**: Techniques for attacking network services and cracking credentials.

##### 2.3.5 Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement
- **Privilege Escalation**: Techniques for increasing permissions on Windows and Linux targets.
- **Lateral Movement**: Moving between machines and subnetworks, including pivoting and tunneling.
- **Metasploit Framework (MSF)**: Tools for automating enumeration and exploitation.

##### 2.3.6 Active Directory
- **Focus**: Understanding and enumerating Active Directory environments.
- **Modules**: Active Directory Introduction and Enumeration, and advanced topics.

#### Conclusion

PWK is designed to equip learners with both the technical skills and the mindset needed to excel in penetration testing. By progressing through the course, learners will not only master specific techniques but also develop the ability to handle the uncertainties inherent in real-world scenarios.
