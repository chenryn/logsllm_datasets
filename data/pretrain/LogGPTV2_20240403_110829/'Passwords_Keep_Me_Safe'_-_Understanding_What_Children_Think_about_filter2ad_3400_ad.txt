Table 8. Passwords containing dictionary words or numbers 
As in Table 8, only a small percentage (under 5 %) of all age 
groups)  created  passwords  with  a  single  dictionary  word. 
There were significantly fewer ES created passwords using a 
single dictionary word plus numbers and special characters 
preceding or following the word– Dictionary word plus, as 
compared to their older counterparts–MS (χ2 =	12.13, df = 1) 
and HS (χ2 =	10.19, df = 1). There were significantly more 
compared to MS (χ2 =	33.47, df = 1) and to HS (χ2 =	98.83, 
only passwords as compared to HS (χ2 =	6.21, df = 1). This 
ES  (almost  1/3)  created  passwords  with  only  numbers,  as 
df = 1). In addition, significantly more MS created numbers-
In  addition,  the  passwords  did  not  use  a  broad  range  of 
characters, much like adults [22]. For all three age groups, 
only 8 alphabetic characters and four numbers “0, 1, 2, 3” 
were used with frequency higher than or equal to 3 %.  
Many  of  the  passwords  contained  passphrases  or  multiple 
common words. We specifically examined the passwords for 
the following three characteristics (Table 8): 
•  Dictionary word: a single dictionary word, 
•  Dictionary word plus: a single dictionary word plus 
numbers  and  special  characters  preceding  or 
following the word, 
indicates  that  as  children  progress  from  ES  to  HS,  they 
created fewer and fewer numbers-only passwords. 
The created passwords often consist of concepts reflecting 
the current state of the children’s lives.  Password themes 
included references to sports, video games, names, animals, 
movies,  titles  (princess,  queen,  etc.),  numbers  and  colors. 
Passwords  demonstrating  these  themes  by  ES  include: 
“12345”, 
and 
“PrincessFrog248”.  Passwords  created  by  MS  include: 
“Basketball1130”,  “GameGuy007”,  and  “Gamehead77”. 
Passwords  created  by  HS  include:  “callofdutyblackops”, 
“ILoveFortnite”,  and  “Soccer  player.15”.  Several  children 
provided  their  password  creation  strategies,  instead  of 
actually creating an example password. For instance, an ES 
wrote  “Maybe  a  birthdate  or  something.”  (P1168,  4th), 
another MS wrote “My gamer tag, then random numbers” 
“doggysafesecure”, 
“Yellow”, 
(P2970,  8th),  and  an  HS  provided  “firstnamelastname123” 
(P2837, 11th). 
Password Strength  
For the purpose of our study, we measured password strength 
with the password strength meter which uses the zxcvbn.js4 
script.  This  is  an open-source  tool,  which  uses  pattern 
matching and searches for the minimum entropy of a given 
password. While we investigated the use of other password 
strength assessment tools, we were limited to tools that do 
not retain password data in order to comply with our IRB 
requirements. 
The rating score provided by zxcvbn.js measures password 
strength  on  an  ordinal  scale  with  “0”  being  assigned  to  a 
password that can be guessed within 100 guesses. A “4” is 
assigned to a password that required over 10 to the power of 
8 guesses. Collapsing password strength to a 5-item ordinal 
scale undeniably suppresses data variance. For example, if 
the number of guesses to crack one password was 1,100 and 
the  estimated  number  of  guesses  for  another  password  is 
9,900, both passwords would be assigned a rating of 2. Yet 
there is a large difference in the number of guesses and the 
identical  rating  does  not  reflect  this.  Figure  7  shows  the 
strengths of passwords across the three groups.

Figure 7. Password Strengths (in %) 
The HS’ passwords were significantly stronger than the ES’ 
(z  =  3.40).  The  MS’  passwords  were  also  significantly 
stronger (z = 2.42) than the ES’. For those passwords with a 
score of 1, the students used all numbers or simple common 
words  as  proposed  passwords  such  as:  “1206”,  “112233”, 
“Yellow” and “Game1234”. Examples of strong passwords 
(those with a score of 5) were: 
• 
• 
• 
by ES: “Love_Butter56” and “Dolphins blue tale”;  
by MS: “ArrowTurner_8435!” and 
“dancingdinosaursavrwhoop164”;  
by HS: “Soccer player.15” and 
“Aiken_bacon@28”.

Not surprisingly, as children age, their use of technology and 
online activities change. The percentages of students having

involves  personal 
cell  phones  increased  almost  20  %  from  ES  to  MS  and 
another  10  %  from  MS  to  HS.  With  age,  social  activities 
naturally increase as described in the PEW article of Teen, 
Social  Media  and  Technology  Study  2018  [2].    Our  data 
confirm  this  trend—both  texting  and  social  media  use 
increase  significantly  from  ES  to  MS  to  HS.  HS  also  use 
email  significantly  more  than  ES  or  MS.  The  increased 
technology  use  translates  to  needs  for  authentication  for 
older children. A coping strategy may be that over 80 % of 
HS and MS reported using the same password for everything 
much like password reuse of adults [37, 42]. 
5.1  RQ1: Password Understandings 
Generation Z, or those born from the mid-1990’s to the late 
2000’s (the population of focus in this study) have several 
unique  generational  characteristics  that  influence  their 
behavior [3] [29]. For example, they are digital natives and 
have grown up in a fully digital world where interaction with 
technologies is a part of normal life, requires authentication, 
and 
[29]. 
Additionally, more children are gaining access to a variety of 
technologies  earlier  and  more  frequently  than  their  older 
counterparts, all of which are reflected in our participants’ 
password understandings.  
Participants frequently specifically mentioned securing their 
personal  phones  and  computers,  and  were  particularly 
concerned about access: the code access was applied to 601 
participant responses, and pertained to both personal access 
to one’s own devices/information and preventing unwanted 
access by others as seen in Figures 8, 9, and 10. For example, 
(P1880, 6th) indicated that one “should have a password so 
that people won’t go through your phone” and (P394, 4th) 
found  passwords  to  be  important  “to  unlock  games  (and) 
unlock computers.” 
Frequently, access was associated with matters of privacy, as 
indicated in Figures 9 and 10 which demonstrate that MS and 
HS  participants  noted  privacy  concerns  as  their  primary 
response.  Whereas  adults  frequently  worry  about  hackers’ 
access  to  tangible  things  like  bank  account  information, 
students  frequently  use  technology  for  purposes  deeply 
related to their identities like social media, gaming identities, 
and texting, and their password understandings reflect these 
uses. In terms of social development, as children–particularly 
preteens  and  teenagers  like  the  majority  of  this  study’s 
participants–begin to explore and exercise autonomy, their 
privacy  becomes  an  increasing  concern.  In  this  study, 
participants  frequently  emphasized 
importance  of 
passwords  for  personal  information  privacy,  like  (P2034, 
11th) who commented that passwords “secure...account(s) on 
social  media”  and  (P2972,  8th)  who  commented  that 
passwords make it to where “your siblings or family/friends 
can’t get to any of your stuff.” Additionally, younger (ES) 
participants’ privacy concerns were more general, whereas 
the 
their  MS  and  HS  counterparts  were  increasingly  more 
specific to things like gaming, social media, and cell phones. 
This makes sense, as younger students less frequently have 
unsupervised access to these applications and therefore do 
not associate them with expectations of privacy.

Finally, though the idea of safety was an incredibly popular 
response  in  the  open-ended  question  about  students’ 
password  understandings  (the  words  “safe”  or  “safety” 
appeared in 609 individual responses) the mentions of safety 
were,  more  than  any  other  coded  response,  vague.  For 
example, the words “safe” or “safety” were most likely to be 
written  alone  or  accompanied  by  vague  concepts  like 
“things” and “stuff”, e.g., “to keep stuff safe” (P1396, 11th) 
and “to keep things safe” (P1454, 7th). This raises questions

have  been  raised  in  a  digital  age  that  teaches  them  that 
passwords  and  other  security  measures  are  important  for 
safety, without ever explaining what that safety means. More 
open-ended qualitative investigation is needed to understand.  
5.2  RQ2: Password Practices and Behaviors 
Children’s  ages  influence  their  password  practices  and 
behaviors.  Younger  children  rely  more  on  their  family  in 
creating and remembering passwords. Almost six times as 
many  ES  (about  90  %)  reported  having  parental  help  in 
creating  their  passwords,  in  contrast  to  HS  (about  15  %). 
Moreover,  about  43  %  of  the  younger  children  reported 
getting  help  from  family  members  in  remembering  their 
passwords, as compared to only 7 % of the HS. 
Both school and parents play an important role of providing 
guidance on ‘good’ password hygiene across all age groups. 
Additionally, almost half of MS and a third of HS reported 
assisting 
remembering 
passwords.  
The  participants  reported  having  some  good  password 
behaviors including memorizing passwords, limiting writing 
passwords  on  paper,  keeping  their  passwords  private,  and 
signing out after computer use (as shown in Figure 2 and 
Table  6).  However,  students  in  our  study  frequently  used 
words (presumably) containing personal information, which 
is a less secure behavior that is also reflected in other studies 
of children’s password behavior [10, 35].  Additionally, as 
students grew older, they were increasingly more likely to 
share their password(s) with friends. In the age of modern 
technology where at least 84% of teenagers own cell phones 
[11], this actually makes sense: the use of various in-phone 
applications, video, and camera functions is ubiquitous and 
socially casual. Some students share their phone passwords 
with close friends or significant others in order to establish 
trust and make access to certain phone functions faster and 
easier.  Unfortunately,  this  behavior  often  stands  in  direct 
contradiction to the students’ own perceptions that sharing 
passwords is bad.  
The simplistic nature of passwords is expected for younger 
students  where  literacy  is  improving  as  they  age.  This  is 
especially true with younger students who are working on 
mastering their alphabet and numbers. Special character use 
was very scarce across all of the grades. This is evidenced by 
the  fact  that  very  few  special  characters  appeared  in  the 
passwords created by the children in this study. The overall 
use of special characters by ES was less than 0.75 % except 
for white space which had a frequency of 3.00 %. The few 
special  characters  used  were  common  punctuation  marks 
such as comma (,), period (.), dash (-), and exclamation (!).  
Despite the awareness shown when discussing the purposes 
of  passwords,  the  passwords  chosen  by  the  children 
(particularly by the younger age group) were weak. There 
in 
their 
letters,  and  characters 
were improvements in the older groups (both MS and HS are 
significantly stronger than ES). The MS and HS passwords 
are equally distributed among scores 2, 3, 4, 5 (Figure 7). 
Unfortunately,  adults  also  create  passwords  that  are  weak 
and easy to guess [4, 12, 18, 28, 40, 41]. Generally, adults 
find  it  difficult  to  choose  passwords  that  are  easy  to 
remember  and  hard  to  guess  [43]  especially  given  the 
overwhelming number of passwords they must manage [8, 
14]. We did not ask students to explain why they chose the 
numbers, 
fabricated 
passwords.  
There is clearly a need to address how children, particularly 
in the younger age group, understand and use passwords in 
regard  to  understanding  threats  to  passwords  and  valuing 
accounts  [38].  Children  should  be  guided  in  discussions 
about  password  strength  requirements  and  why  these 
requirements  exist.  Traditional  password  requirements 
would  suggest  that  the  complexity  and  strength  required 
should  increase  as  the  child’s  ability  develops.  However, 
new password guidelines published by the National Institute 
of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  state  that  password 
complexity  requirements  do  not  ensure  strong  passwords; 
instead,  longer  passphrase-like  passwords  are  encouraged 
[15]. It will be helpful to provide guidance to youth on how 
to evaluate what it is that is being protected, how strong a 
password  is  needed,  and  how  to  create  an  appropriate
