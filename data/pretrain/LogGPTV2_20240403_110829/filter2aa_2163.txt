“Being in the Know”
An overview to 
Scanning modern radio systems
Presented by:

The Basics
• Simplex
– One frequency shared by multiple stations
– Limited coverage
• Tones
– Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System 
(CTCSS)
• Private Line (PL)
– Digital Coded Squelch (DCS)
• Repeaters
– Two frequencies (input & output)
– Increased Coverage
So you want to listen to stuff
• Back in the day it was easy…
• You just dialed in the frequency and 
you were good to go.
– 154.905 Utah Highway Patrol SLC
– 155.505 Statewide
– 154.2350 SLCO Fire Dispatch
• Not quite as easy these days…
– Trunked, Digital, Encrypted, etc
What is Trunked Radio
• Users are grouped by Talk Group 
rather than Frequency
• Radios monitor a central channel called 
the Control Channel
• When a user keys the radio the control 
channel tells other what frequency to 
move to
• When done, users return to the control 
channel and wait for the next call
System Types
• Ericsson (EDACS)
– Enhanced Digital Access Communication System
• E.F Johnson (LTR)
– Logical Trunked Radio
• Motorola
– Probably the most common type of system
Ericsson
Enhanced Digital Access 
Communication System (EDACS)
EDACS - Overview
• Central Control Channel
• Each frequency is assigned an LCN
– Logical Channel Number
• Controller tells radios what LCN to 
switch to when radio traffic is present
• Frequencies must be entered in LCN 
order to scan properly
E.F Johnson
Logical Trunked Radio (LTR)
This is what The Riviera Runs
LTR - Overview
• Decentralized Model
• Uses sub-audible data on each 
frequency to control system
• Each frequency is assigned an LCN
– Logical Channel Number
• Users are assigned to a specific LCN 
and only move if it is busy
• Frequencies must be entered in LCN 
order to scan properly

UCAN
• Motorola Smart Zone Omni Link
• Established in 1997
• Operational in January 2002 
• Over 120 Agencies use the system
– Consisting of over 15,300 radios
– 38 Known Sites (many with simulcast)
• 2002 Olympics 
– 8.5 million transmissions
– 5.5 per second

APCO 25
APCO 25
• What is APCO 25?
– Association of Public Safety 
Communications Officials International.
– APCO 25 brings together representatives 
from many local, state and federal 
government agencies who evaluate basic 
technologies in advanced land mobile 
radio.  
APCO 25  Benefits
• Provides enhanced functionality with 
equipment and capabilities focused on public 
safety needs. 
• Improved spectrum efficiency. 
• Ensures competition among multiple vendors 
through Open Systems Architecture. 
• Allows effective, efficient, and reliable 
interoperability
APCO 25
• So what does that all mean for us.  
• We will still be able to listen to the public 
saftey transmissions.  
• APCO 25 Helps ensure this.  
Rebanding
Rebanding
• Rebanding (also called Reconfiguration) 
refers to changes to the 800 MHz band plan 
that are taking place nationwide
• In the late 1990's, the FCC realized that they 
had a problem with Nextel.
Why won't my scanner work 
after rebanding?
• Well, depending on what you listen to, it 
might work. 
• If you listen to EDACS or LTR (or 
conventional), you will just need to 
reprogram the new frequencies and logical 
channel numbers (LCN).
•
However, if you listen to Motorola systems 
(which still comprise the largest number of 
public safety systems), your scanner will 
have a problem. 
How will my scanner work 
after rebanding?
• Motorola has several options when it comes 
to rebanding. They could: 
• 1. Just change their channelization and make 
no other changes to the data. 
• 2. Use the control channel format used for 
P25 systems. 
• 3. Use a completely new control channel 
format specifically for rebanded systems. 
• 4. Something else... No vendor has a fix.
