User: I've recently started using virtualenv, and would like to install lxml in this isolated environment.
Normally I would use the windows binary installer, but I want to use lxml in this virtualenv (not globally). Pip install does not work for lxml, so I'm at a loss for what I can do.
I've read that creating symlinks may work, although I unfamiliar with how symlinks work and what files I should be creating them for. Does anyone else know of any methods to install lxml in a virtualenv on Windows?
If creating symlinks is the only method that works I'm definitely willing to learn if someone can point me in the right direction.
Assistant: Just wanted to add that emeraldo.cs's answer is correct, but you also have to copy the lxml related files that exist in the site-packages root. Once all the files are copied, pip will think it's installed.
