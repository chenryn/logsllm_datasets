### IGMP and MLD in IPv4 and IPv6 Multicast

#### IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)

- **IGMP Host Membership Query**: A router sends an IGMP Host Membership Query message to the all-hosts IPv4 multicast address. If no responses are received after several queries, the router assumes there are no members of that group on the network and stops advertising that group-network information to other routers.
- **IGMP Leave Group Message**: When a host leaves an IPv4 multicast group and determines it is the last member of that group on the subnet, it sends an IGMP Leave Group message.

**IGMP Versions:**
- **IGMPv1**: Defined in RFC 1112.
- **IGMPv2**: Defined in RFC 2236.
- **IGMPv3**: Defined in RFC 3376.

**Support in Windows:**
- TCP/IP in Windows supports IGMP, IGMPv2, and IGMPv3. No configuration is required for a Windows-based computer to use these versions.

#### MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) for IPv6

- **MLD**: The IPv6 equivalent of IGMPv2, MLD is a set of ICMPv6 messages exchanged between routers and nodes to discover the set of multicast addresses for which there are listening nodes on each attached interface.
- **MLD Messages**:
  - **Joining a Group**: A host sends an MLD Multicast Listener Report message to the specific IPv6 multicast address, declaring its membership in a specific host group.
  - **Polling the Network**: A router sends an MLD Multicast Listener Query message to the link-local scope all-hosts IPv6 multicast address (FF02::1) to ensure there are members of a specific host group.
  - **Leaving a Group**: When a host leaves an IPv6 multicast group and determines it is the last member on the subnet, it sends an MLD Multicast Listener Done message.

**MLD Versions:**
- **MLDv1**: Described in RFC 2710.
- **MLDv2**: The IPv6 equivalent of IGMPv3, described in RFC 3810. Supported in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.

**Table A-1: IGMPv2 and MLD Equivalents**

| IGMPv2 Message          | MLD Equivalent              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Host Membership Report  | Multicast Listener Report   |
| Host Membership Query   | Multicast Listener Query    |
| Leave Group             | Multicast Listener Done     |

### Multicast Forwarding in Windows

#### IPv4 Multicast Forwarding

- **Components**:
  - IPv4 multicast forwarding by the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component.
  - The IGMP routing protocol component of Routing and Remote Access.

- **Enabling IPv4 Multicast Forwarding**:
  - Enabled when you configure and enable Routing and Remote Access.
  - The IPv4 multicast forwarding table can be viewed from the Routing and Remote Access snap-in or using the `netsh routing ip show mfe` command.

- **IPv6 Multicast Forwarding**:
  - Enabled with the `netsh interface ipv6 set global multicastforwarding=enable` command.
  - Note: There is no mechanism to update the IPv6 multicast forwarding table at the time of this publication.

#### IGMP Routing Protocol Component

- **Adding the IGMP Routing Protocol**:
  1. Open Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Routing and Remote Access.
  2. In the console tree, open Routing and Remote Access, the server name, and then either IPv4 or IP Routing.
  3. Right-click General, select New Routing Protocol, choose IGMP Router And Proxy, and click OK.

- **Configuring IGMP Interfaces**:
  1. In the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, right-click IGMP, and select New Interface.
  2. Choose the interface, verify the Enable IGMP checkbox is selected, and configure the mode and IGMP version.

- **Modes**:
  - **IGMP Router Mode**:
    - Listens in multicast promiscuous mode.
    - Listens for IGMP Host Membership Report and Leave Group messages.
    - Sends IGMP Host Membership Queries.
    - Maintains entries in the IPv4 multicast forwarding table.
  - **IGMP Proxy Mode**:
    - Forwards IGMP Host Membership Reports.
    - Registers multicast MAC addresses.
    - Adds entries to the multicast forwarding table.
    - Receives multicast traffic on IGMP proxy mode interfaces and forwards it to appropriate interfaces.

### MADCAP (Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol)

- **Purpose**: Allocate IPv4 multicast addresses using existing DHCP infrastructure.
- **Components**:
  - **MADCAP Servers**: Allocate IPv4 multicast addresses. Configured using the DHCP snap-in.
  - **MADCAP Clients**: Use the MADCAP protocol to request, renew, or release IPv4 multicast addresses.

- **Multicast Scopes**:
  - **Administratively Scoped Addresses**: 239.192.0.0/14 range, for internal use.
  - **Globally Scoped Addresses**: 233.0.0.0/8 range, for use on the Internet.

- **Creating a Multicast Scope**:
  1. Open Control Panel > Administrative Tools > DHCP.
  2. Click the applicable DHCP server.
  3. On the Action menu, select New Multicast Scope.
  4. Follow the New Multicast Scope wizard to configure the multicast address range, exclusions, lease duration, and scope activation.

### Reliable Multicast with PGM (Pragmatic General Multicast)

- **Overview**:
  - PGM is a reliable multicast protocol that uses NACK packets for retransmission requests.
  - PGM-enabled routers define a logical topology and assist in recovering lost packets.
  - PGM does not provide flow control, byte stream windowing, or congestion control.

- **Adding the Reliable Multicast Protocol**:
  1. Right-click the connection in the Network Connections folder and select Properties.
  2. Click Install, double-click Protocol, select Reliable Multicast Protocol, and click OK.

- **Writing PGM-enabled Applications**:
  - Use Windows Sockets and PGM socket options.
  - Sender: Create a PGM socket, bind to any address, and connect to the multicast group address.
  - Receiver: Create a PGM socket, bind to the multicast group address, post a listen, and use the `accept()` function to obtain a socket handle.

- **Microsoft Products Using PGM**:
  - Message Queuing (MSMQ)
  - Automated Deployment Services (ADS)

- **Process Flow**:
  - **Receiver**:
    1. Opens a listen socket with reliable multicast socket options.
    2. Sends an IGMP Host Membership Report message.
  - **Sender**:
    1. Opens a send socket with reliable multicast socket options.
    2. Begins sending data with sequence numbers starting from 0.
