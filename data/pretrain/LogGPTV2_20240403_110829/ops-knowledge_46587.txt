User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows Server 2012 R2, cannot install any role or features using GUI Server manager Exiting environment : Windows Server 2008 R2.
 I am in the process of migrating to Windows Server 2012 R2. I installed Windows Server 2012 R2 on HP DL380p G8 server. I am able to install role or feature using PowerShell but not via GUI ServerManager.

Now, when I go to add a any role or features using GUI ServerManager I am getting the following errors:

**Failed to open runspace pool. The Server Manager WinRM plug-in might be corrupt or missing**


I did the following troubleshooting already:


Run WinRM quickconfig which shows the service is running and setup for management. 
Restored WinRM settings: winrm invoke restore winrm/config @{}
Restored WinRM plugin settings: winrm invoke restore winrm/config/plugin @{}
Add "127.0.0.1" and "::1" to the IP listen list
Disabled the firewall 
Ensured the Windows Remote Management (WS-Management) service is running.
Granted the  “Validated Write to Service Principal Name” permission to the NETWORK SERVICE using theADSIEDIT.msc


Following are the errors logged:
Event ID 10154

The WinrRM failed to create the following SPNs:WSMAN/xxx.abc.com:WSMAN/xxx


Application and services log
Event ID 142

WSMAN Operation CreateShell failed, error code 2150858811


I googled but nothing seems to help. 

Any help will be highly appreciated.

Assistant: This sounds like an issue with the OS installation. If possible, I would run a sfc /scannow on the server and see if that corrects it. If not, toss the OS CD in there and run a repair from that.
