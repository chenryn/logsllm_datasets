### Abstract
In recent years, blockchains have been a focal point of security research, leading to significant advancements in the design, formalization, and analysis of blockchain protocols. However, the broader class of distributed ledgers, which includes both blockchains and non-blockchain protocols such as Corda and OmniLedger, remains underexplored in the security literature. These distributed ledgers often deviate from traditional blockchain paradigms, such as block structures, system-wide consensus, and global consistency.

This paper addresses this gap by introducing the first framework for defining and analyzing the security of general distributed ledgers. At the core of our contribution is an ideal distributed ledger functionality, called Fledger, which unifies the treatment of both classical blockchains and non-blockchain distributed ledgers.

To demonstrate the utility of Fledger, we first show that prominent ideal blockchain functionalities, Gledger and GPL, realize (suitable instantiations of) Fledger, thereby capturing their security properties. This implies that their respective implementations, including Bitcoin, Ouroboros Genesis, and Ouroboros Crypsinous, also realize Fledger. Second, we perform the first formal security analysis of a non-blockchain distributed ledger, specifically the widely used Corda protocol. This analysis is of independent interest due to Corda's extensive use in the financial sector.

Our results illustrate that Fledger not only generalizes the modular treatment of blockchains to distributed ledgers but also helps to unify existing results.

## 1 Introduction
In recent years, significant progress has been made in formalizing and analyzing the security of blockchain protocols [3, 5, 16, 21, 26]. Initially, these analyses were based on trace properties [15, 20, 38], but the field has since shifted towards simulation-based security, leveraging the modularity and strong security guarantees offered by universal composability (UC) frameworks [11, 12, 32]. Several ideal blockchain functionalities have been proposed, most notably Gledger by Badertscher et al. [5] and its privacy-preserving variant GPL [26]. These functionalities have been successfully applied to prove the security of various blockchains, including newly designed ones [3, 5, 26].

However, the more general class of distributed ledgers, which includes both blockchains and non-blockchain protocols like Corda [9], OmniLedger [30], and Canton [44], has not been fully addressed. These distributed ledgers often depart from traditional blockchain paradigms, such as system-wide consensus, block structures, and global consistency. By doing so, they aim to achieve higher transaction throughput and enhanced security properties, such as transaction privacy, which are highly desired in industries like finance [14, 19, 23, 24, 39].

Due to these conceptual differences, existing security definitions and results for blockchains do not apply to the broader class of distributed ledger protocols, particularly non-blockchain distributed ledgers (cf. Sections 3 and 4).

In this work, we address this gap by proposing the ideal distributed ledger functionality, Fledger. This functionality provides a flexible and unified framework for the modular security analysis of virtually any distributed ledger, covering both classical blockchains and non-blockchain distributed ledgers.

### The Ideal Ledger Functionality Fledger
Fledger is designed with the following objectives:

1. **Flexibility**: Fledger is highly flexible, with various parameters modeled as generic subroutines. This allows it to capture a wide range of distributed ledgers and a broad spectrum of security properties without changing the ideal functionality itself. These properties include established blockchain security notions, such as consistency and chain-growth, as well as new security properties like partial consistency, which we introduce in this work.

2. **Abstraction**: The interface and core logic of Fledger abstract from technical details of specific implementations, such as internal roles (miners or notaries), maintenance operations (mining, consensus mechanisms), and setup assumptions (networks with bounded delay, honest majorities, trusted parties). This abstraction facilitates the specification, modeling, and analysis of higher-level protocols.

3. **General Corruption Model**: Fledger supports a general interpretation of corruption, where parties may be considered corrupted based on security assumptions, such as an honest majority. This approach, already used in non-blockchain UC literature [33], improves security analyses by making the commonly used environment-restricting wrapper obsolete.

We demonstrate the power and generality of Fledger through two core results:

1. **Covering Blockchains**: We show that existing results for the modular security of blockchains, such as Gledger and GPL, carry over to Fledger. This means that any realization of Gledger or GPL (with some syntactical alignments) also realizes Fledger, covering all published UC analyses of blockchains, including Bitcoin [5], Ouroboros Genesis [3], and Ouroboros Crypsinous [26].

2. **Case Study: Corda**: We provide the first formal model and security analysis of a non-blockchain distributed ledger, specifically the prominent Corda system. Our analysis uncovers and defines the level of privacy provided for transactions in Corda, including several meta-information leakages. Additionally, while the official specification of Corda requires all notaries to be honest, our analysis shows that Corda achieves security even in the presence of some corrupted notaries, thereby improving on the official security claims.

### Summary of Contributions
- **Fledger**: We propose an ideal functionality, Fledger, for general distributed ledgers. It is the first functionality that can be applied to non-blockchain distributed ledgers, covering both traditional blockchains and non-blockchain distributed ledgers. Fledger offers high flexibility to support a wide variety of different implementations while exposing a simple and implementation-independent interface to higher-level protocols.
- **Subsumption of Gledger and GPL**: We show that Fledger subsumes Gledger and GPL, allowing for the direct transfer of all published results on the modular security of blockchains to Fledger.
- **Corda Analysis**: We provide the first formal model and security analysis of a non-blockchain distributed ledger, Corda, and develop the novel security notion of partial consistency.
