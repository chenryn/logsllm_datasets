User: How do you end up running pypcap for python 2.6 on a mac?  It seems that there hasn't been any new releases since 2.5 or am I just looking in the wrong places?
I seem to be unable to install the 2.5 binary with the following error: You cannot install pcap 1.1 on this volume. pcap requires System Python 2.5 to install.
Assistant: Python 2.5 code should run fine unaltered on Python 2.6 (you'll just occasionaly get a DeprecationWarning for features which are changing in Python 3.x).
