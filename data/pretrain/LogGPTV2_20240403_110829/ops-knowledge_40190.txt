Is it possible to create a Python executable for Linux from macOS?

I understand that PyInstaller is still in the early stages, and I'm not very familiar with other options. Could you recommend any alternatives?

Thank you.

**Response:**

While I'm not certain about the availability of specific tools on macOS, I recommend looking into `cx_Freeze`. It is another popular tool for creating standalone executables from Python scripts and might support cross-compilation for Linux. Additionally, you may want to explore `Nuitka` or `PyOxidizer`, which are also capable of generating standalone executables and might offer better cross-platform support.

I hope this helps!
