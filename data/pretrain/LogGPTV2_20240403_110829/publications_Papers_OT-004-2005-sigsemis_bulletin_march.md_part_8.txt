### 4. Limitations of Our Approach, Future Research, and Related Work

We identify three main limitations in the work presented in this paper:

1. **Learning Curve for Controlled Language:**
   The use of a controlled language, such as Attempto Controlled English (ACE), imposes a learning cost on users. While ACE is easier to learn than formal logic, it still requires some time and effort. Users may be hesitant to adopt a new language, even if it is simpler than traditional logical formalisms. However, experience with ACE and other controlled languages, such as Boeing Simplified English, has shown that the learning process can be completed in a relatively short period—typically a few days for the basics and 4-6 weeks for full proficiency. Additionally, ongoing research is focused on developing query interfaces that guide users in writing correct controlled English sentences, further reducing the learning curve.

2. **Manual Adaptation of Rewrite Rules:**
   Our current prototype requires manual adaptation of rewrite rules when used with a new ontology or knowledge base. Based on our experience, most of the time, an inspection of the meta-model is sufficient to adapt the rules. We believe that these rules could be automatically generated based on the ontology structure, which would significantly reduce the manual effort required.

3. **Limited Evaluation:**
   The evaluation presented in this paper is limited and only provides a preliminary idea of the potential of our approach. A more thorough evaluation is necessary, including tasks where users are given retrieval tasks and their performance is compared using our front-end versus other semantic web query tools based on plain logic, query by example, etc. Additionally, we need to investigate how users' retrieval performance is related to their background and familiarity with the domain.

### 5. Related Work

To our knowledge, there are no other applications of controlled natural language querying for semantic web content. However, there has been significant work on natural language interfaces to databases (not ontologized knowledge bases) since the 1980s. For example, the PRECISE project [Popescu et al. 2003] proposes a natural language interface to relational databases. PRECISE uses a database-augmented tokenization of a query’s parse tree to generate the most likely corresponding SQL statement. It is, consequently, limited to a sublanguage of English, i.e., the language defined by the subject area of the database. In contrast, our approach limits the possible language constructs and not the subject domain.

Our front-end will not return useful answers if none can be found in the ontology. However, it will be able to generate an appropriate PQL statement. We hope to include an empirical comparison between our approach and others, such as PRECISE, in future work.

### 6. Conclusion and Future Work

The approach presented in this paper is in its early stages. While ACE has been under development for many years, the ontology-based transformation rules are very new. Nevertheless, we believe that people's familiarity with natural languages might be key to simplifying their interaction with vast ontologies. Our approach has the potential to bridge the gap between the semantic web and its users.
