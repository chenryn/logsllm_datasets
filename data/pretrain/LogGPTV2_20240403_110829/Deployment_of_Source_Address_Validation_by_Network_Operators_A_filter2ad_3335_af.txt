### Simplified and Optimized Text

**Notification Steps and SAV Configuration:**
Implementing Source Address Validation (SAV) typically involves a series of straightforward steps. However, SAV requires a comprehensive understanding of the network, including router configurations and types, which complicates the creation of a simple, step-by-step guide. Additionally, recipients may need to escalate the issue to senior network operators due to the potential for downtime and the risk of major disruptions from misconfiguration.

**Target Audience:**
Several studies have notified network operators about routing and security issues, but none included a control group, which is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of remediation. Our study is the first to focus on network operators and conduct a randomized controlled trial. Previous studies either sent notifications to domain owners or asked network operators to forward messages to users, thereby shifting the primary responsibility for remediation.

**Liability and Incentives:**
The incentives for our study participants differ from those of most network operators. The benefits of implementing SAV are primarily realized by the broader internet community rather than the individual operators. Despite this, networks that implement SAV remain vulnerable to DDoS attacks from other networks. A prior study found higher remediation rates due to legal consequences, but there is no legal liability for operators to prevent spoofed traffic from leaving their network.

**Language of Notifications:**
Our notifications were sent in English, except for those administered by the Brazilian CERT, which were in Portuguese. While using the native language of network operators could potentially improve the effectiveness of interventions, our study found no significant impact from the language difference. This aligns with earlier research that also found no effect on remediation when multiple languages were used.

**Awareness of Vulnerability:**
The security community has made significant efforts to deploy SAV over the past several years. Some network operators may already be aware of their non-compliance through notifications from the Spoofer project but have either ignored these notifications or cannot deploy SAV due to technical limitations. It is important to note that our dataset differs significantly from those used in previous Spoofer-based campaigns and has not been used in prior notification efforts.

**Reasons for Non-Remediation:**
Our survey results indicate that 57% of respondents did not follow the recommendation to implement SAV, even though we confirmed that we reached the correct recipient in most cases. This contrasts with previous work where only 24% of operators mentioned they did not implement SAV. One possible explanation is that Lichtblau et al. [17] contacted only Network Operators Group (NOG) members, who are likely more aware of security challenges and willing to adopt best practices.

The reasons for non-compliance include:
- Lack of time or priority.
- Concerns about performance issues or technical limitations.
- Limited knowledge on how to perform filtering.

**Moving Forward: Recommendations:**

**Improving Notification Channels:**
Most of our notifications reached the intended recipients. To ensure they reach the team responsible for security and routing, providers should be encouraged by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) to maintain up-to-date contact details for their technical teams.

**Improving Resources:**
MANRS provides guidelines for implementing SAV, but these should be available in multiple languages and cover a wider range of router brands beyond CISCO and Juniper.

**Improving Incentives:**
The main challenge with routing security is that the financial and human resource costs of remediation are borne by the operator, while the benefits accrue to the broader internet. To address this, upstream providers can leverage their position to encourage compliance. For example, some providers have dropped non-compliant customers, leading to corrective actions. Legislation could also play a role by making providers liable for network attacks. Notably, Albania and the Philippines consider failing to correct security flaws as administrative and criminal offenses.
