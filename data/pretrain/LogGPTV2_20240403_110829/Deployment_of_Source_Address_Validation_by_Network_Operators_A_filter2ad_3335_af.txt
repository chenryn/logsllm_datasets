usually have to follow a set of simple steps in the notiﬁcation.
In comparison, SAV requires a thorough understanding of
the network. The conﬁgurations and types of routers make it
difﬁcult to provide a similar guide. Finally, the recipients of the
notiﬁcation might need to escalate the issue to senior network
operators since it requires downtime, and misconﬁguration can
cause major disruptions.
Target Audience: Multiple studies notiﬁed network oper-
ators about routing and security issues [7], [22]. However,
none of these had a control group, which is required to
reliably assess the effectiveness of remediation. Our study is
the ﬁrst one that focuses on network operators and performs a
randomized control trial. Previous studies using RCTs either
sent notiﬁcations to the domain owners [27], [76], [77] or to
the network operator about compromised user devices [24].
In those cases, the operators are only asked to forward the
message. They do not incur the main cost, as they rely on
their users to remediate the problem.
Liability and incentives: The incentives of treatment sub-
jects in our experiment is different from most operators of
vulnerable or compromised resources. The beneﬁts of imple-
menting SAV ﬂow to the rest of the Internet, not the operators
themselves. The network implementing SAV is still vulnerable

to DDoS attacks from other networks. In terms of liability, a
prior study had found higher remediation rates because of legal
consequences [8]. However, there is no liability on operators
prevent spoofed trafﬁc from leaving their network.
Language of Notiﬁcation: We sent out our treatments in
English, except for those administered by the Brazilian CERT,
which were in Portuguese. Notiﬁcations in network operators’
native language could have improved the effectiveness of
interventions. However, our study found no impact of the
language difference. This is consistent with earlier work where
more languages were included in a notiﬁcation experiment,
which also found no impact on remediation [11].
Awareness of Vulnerability: There has been a signiﬁcant
effort by the security community to deploy SAV over the
last several years [7], [62], [80]. It is possible that some
network operators already know through notiﬁcations from
the Spoofer project that their network is non-compliant and
have either ignored prior notiﬁcations or cannot deploy SAV
due to technical limitations. That said, it is important to note
that our dataset is very different from that used in the Spoofer-
based campaigns, the main notiﬁcation effort in this area. This
dataset has not been used in previous notiﬁcation campaigns.
D. Reasons for Non-Remediation
Our survey results found that 57% of respondents did not
follow the recommendation to implement SAV, even though
they conﬁrmed we reached the right recipient in most cases.
It contradicts previous work [17], where only 24% of the
operators mentioned that
implement SAV in
their networks. One possible explanation is that Lichtblau et
al. [17] contacted only NOG members. The operators who
have subscribed to the list are likely more aware of security
challenges and willing to adopt best practices.
they did not
Our survey results revealed several
reasons for non-
compliance. Perhaps surprisingly, awareness about IP spooﬁng
and the absence of responsibility for router conﬁgurations
are not the prominent reasons. The majority of our survey
respondents said that
they were aware of the issue and
were responsible for its remediation. Yet, many participants
acknowledged that they were not familiar with how to perform
ﬁltering. Thus, as we discuss in Section VII-E, educating
network operators about security vulnerabilities and remedies
are important to improve compliance.
A large proportion of participants also mentioned that they
lack time for implementing SAV, or that it is not their top
priority. Finally, some respondents acknowledged concerns
about performance issues or technical limitations deferring
them from implementing SAV in their networks. While un-
derstanding relative impact of those reasons on remediation
requires future work, our research and previous studies [1],
[17] conclude that there is a need for community-driven efforts
in aligning operators’ incentives and providing better resources
for addressing technical challenges with SAV implementation.
We further discuss the recommendations for improving SAV
adoption in the next section.
E. Moving Forward: Recommendations
Although notiﬁcations did not dramatically increase SAV
adoption, we propose a number of steps that can help improve
the adoption of routing and security vulnerability remediation.
Improving Notiﬁcation Channels: Our survey response
indicate that most of our notiﬁcations reached the recipients.
However, to make sure they reach the team responsible for
security and routing, we propose that providers should be
encouraged by RIRs to ﬁll in and keep up-to-date the technical
team’s contact details, in addition to abuse-email contacts.
Improving Resources: MANRS provides guidelines to
network providers that describe how to implement SAV in their
network, in English. To increase SAV adoption, it should be
available in other languages, and it should cover other popular
brands of routers in addition to CISCO and Juniper.
Improving Incentives: The main issue with routing security
is that the remediation entails ﬁnancial costs and requires
human resources, while beneﬁts would be mostly absorbed by
the rest of the Internet. To align the incentives, the Internet
community can play its part. Most of the providers with
stub networks get connectivity through upstream providers.
They hold a unique vantage point where they can detect
if the incoming packets have a spoofed source [7], [17],
[23]. If they exercise their position of power and peer with
compliant networks, the overall compliance could increase
signiﬁcantly. There are examples where network providers
leveraged their power to achieve compliance. For instance,
a provider dropped invalid preﬁxes from its customer ASes
[81]. The owners of the preﬁxes took corrective action and
updated their Route Origin Authorizations (ROA) to ﬁx the
issue. Similarly, after observing a consistent BGP hijack from
Bitcanal, Hurricane Electric and Portugal’s IP Telecom were
able to cut them off from the Internet [82]. Thus, the network
community needs to take corrective actions. This could be
supported by legislation that makes the providers liable for
network attacks. Interestingly,
two countries—Albania and
the Philippines—consider avoiding correcting security ﬂaws
as administrative and criminal offenses [83]. Both inside
and outside the network community, actions are possible to
improve the incentives for SAV adoption.
