## Metadata Search Engines
When using a typical search engine like Google, your query is processed, and relevant results are retrieved from its index database. Metasearch engines, however, do not maintain their own indexes. Instead, they send your query to multiple search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo) and other third-party data sources, retrieve the results, rank them, and present them through their web interface.

Metasearch engines often have agreements with major search engines to access and retrieve content from their indexes. Some metasearch engines use their own ranking algorithms to present compiled results to users, but they cannot alter the rank or relevancy of the content provided by their data sources. Therefore, it is generally advisable to focus on the top results from each partner search engine.

The primary advantage of metasearch engines is their ability to compile results from multiple sources, reducing search time and providing more comprehensive results while enhancing user privacy compared to traditional search engines. Here are some popular metasearch engines:

## FTP Search Engines
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an old protocol used to transfer files between computers across networks like the Internet. Web hosting companies typically provide FTP accounts for file transfers. Many organizations, universities, and collaboration projects use FTP servers to share large archive files and downloadable software among employees. FTP accounts can be accessed using clients like FileZilla, which supports uploading, downloading, and renaming files. While most FTP servers are password-protected, many are left unsecured and can be accessed directly through web browsers.

According to the IEEE Computer Society, there are over 13 million FTP servers worldwide, with 1.1 million allowing anonymous (public) access. Public FTP servers can contain a wealth of useful information, including music, video files, licensed software, tax documents, cryptographic secrets, and personal files.

When searching for content on FTP servers using specialized FTP search engines, you are primarily searching for filenames and directories, as indexing all content on all FTP servers is challenging. Here are some advanced Google search queries to find FTP servers:

- **`inurl:“ftp://www.” “Index of /”`**: Finds FTP servers online.
- **`inurl:ftp -inurl:(http|https) “SEARCH QUERY”`**: Searches for all FTP servers containing the specified search query.

Some sites to search FTP servers include:
- **Global File Search**
  - **Website:** [Global File Search](http://globalfilesearch.com)
- **Filemare**
  - **Website:** [Filemare](https://filemare.com/en-nl)

## Web Directories
A web directory, also known as a subject directory, is a website that lists and organizes many sites into categories, similar to a phone book. Each category contains websites related to a specific topic, and the directory has a hierarchical structure, focusing on linking to site home pages rather than individual pages. Web directories are usually managed by human reviewers, who add and update content. To add a website to a web directory, a webmaster must submit the site address, supply keywords, and define its niche. A moderator then checks the submission for fitness.

Users can use a web directory's internal search engine to find specific websites or browse all websites under a specific topic. Web directories can be either free or paid. Free directories charge no money for inclusion, while paid ones require a fee. Some directories ask for a reciprocal link, requiring a link back to the directory on the submitted site's homepage.

While search engines use keywords to locate information, web directories organize websites by subject, language, and region, enabling users to find groups of relevant sites. Users can then use search engine techniques, such as a Google custom search, to search within each category for specific information.

Here are some popular web directories:

- **The WWW Virtual Library**
  - **Website:** [The WWW Virtual Library](http://vlib.org)
