 Metadata Search Engines
When you conduct a search using a typical search engine like Google, your query will get 
processed by the search engine, which looks up your search query in its index database 
and retrieves relevant results accordingly. Metasearch engines are different; these 
engines do not have their own indexes. Instead, they send your search query to other 
search engines (such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo) in addition to other third-party data 
sources. Then they retrieve the results, rank them, and present the final output to you 
through their web interface.
Metasearch engines make agreements with the “true” search engine providers (like 
Google and Bing) to allow them to search and retrieve content from their indexes. Some 
meta search engines do use their own ranking schema to present the compiled results 
to end users. However, they cannot interfere with—or decide—the rank and relevancy 
of contents delivered to them by their data sources. Thus, you should usually stick to the 
top results from each partner search engine.
A major advantage of metasearch engines is their ability to compile results from 
many sources for each user search inquiry. Searching multiple sources instantly will 
reduce the time required for conducting the search and will return more comprehensive

 FTP Search Engines
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an old protocol invented in the early days of the 
Internet and still used by millions of websites. As its name implies, it is used to transfer 
files between computers across networks like the Internet. Web hosting companies 
usually give its customers an FTP account to transfer files to their hosting space. Many 
companies, universities, institutions, and collaboration projects put large archive 
files and other downloadable software on FTP servers to facilitate sharing among 
its employees. FTP accounts can be accessed using a special client such as FileZilla 
(https://filezilla-project.org) that supports uploading, downloading, and 
renaming files. Companies usually protect their FTP servers with a password. However, 
you can find plenty of them left unsecured online (without a password), and such public 
FTP servers can be accessed through web browsers directly to view/download their 
contents.
According to the IEEE Computer Society,iv there are more than 13 million FTP 
servers in the world, 1.1 million of which allow “anonymous” (public) access. A wealth 
of useful information can be found on public FTP servers, ranging from music and 
video files to licensed software, tax documents, and cryptographic secrets in addition to 
personal files and directories.
When searching for contents on FTP servers using specialized FTP search engines, 
you are only searching for filenames and directories, as indexing all the content on 
all FTP servers is difficult and cannot be achieved easily. Let’s first begin testing some 
techniques with Google to find content on FTP servers; see Table 4-5.
Table 4-5. Advanced Google Search Queries to Find FTP Servers
Google FTP Search Query
Meaning
inurl:“ftp://www.” “Index of /”
this search query can be used to find Ftp servers online.

use this to search for all Ftp servers that have the 
specified search query.

 Automated Search Tools
Automated tools allow an online searcher to automate the search process using 
major search engines such as Google, Bing, and Shodan. Automated tools are fast and 
allow you to test large numbers of search queries continually, thus returning more 
comprehensive results because the search tool can construct complex search queries 
better than a human. The following sections highlight the most famous automated 
search tools.
 SearchDiggity
This is the most well-known search engine hacking tool; it is a Windows GUI application 
that connects you to famous search engines’ hacking databases such as the Google 
Hacking Database. It works by automating the search process on different search engine 
platforms such as Google, Bing, Shodan, CodeSearch, and others, and it presents 
the results within the program’s main interface. See https://www.bishopfox.com/

 Web Directories
We defined web directory briefly in the previous chapter. A web directory—also known 
as a subject directory—is a website that lists and organizes many sites into categories. 
We can consider it like a phone book. Each letter in this phone book refers to a topic 
or subject (shopping, news, information technology, blog), and each topic has many 
websites belonging to it (for example, information security contains  
www.DarknessGate.com).
The directory has a hierarchical structure; it emphasizes linking to a site home page 
instead of linking to individual pages, thus focusing on the general topic/subject the 
website belongs to. Directories are usually managed by human reviewers; hence, unlike 
search engines that use spiders to index web contents automatically, web directories 
depend on human efforts to add/update their contents. To add a website to a web directory, 
a webmaster needs to submit a site address and supply some keywords and define its 
niche. A moderator—from the web directory—then checks the submission for fitness.
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
155
A user can use a web directory internal search engine to find a specific website 
within the directory or can simply browse all websites under a specific topic (see 
Figure 4-11).
Web directories come in varying sizes. Yahoo and DMOZ are both discontinued now, 
but you can view a static version of DMOZ at http://dmoztools.net. There are huge 
directories covering all types of Internet sites. Other types are specialized web directories 
that cover specific subjects and branch to relevant websites within them.
A web directory can be either free or paid. Free submission sites charge no money 
for include your site in the directory, while the paid ones require a website owner to pay 
a little amount of money to include their site in the directory. Some web directories ask 
for a reciprocal link. Hence, you need to put a link to the directory on your homepage to 
include yours—freely—in their listing.
While websites use keywords to search and locate information online, web 
directories organize all the websites according to each site subject, thus enabling you to 
find groups of relevant sites according to subject, language, and region. Then you can 
use search engine techniques—for example, a Google custom search—to search within 
each category for specific information.
