Dear Fabien,  
Thank you for uploading your slides on the symphony hack day in Berlin.  
I played around with the expression language and the got the error, that in
the router the request is missing.
I created a fork of symfony standard to reproduce the problem:  
https://github.com/sebastianblum/symfony-standard/tree/routing-condition
If I add the condition in the routing.yml
condition: "request.getMethod() in ['GET', 'POST'] and
request.headers.get('User-Agent') matches '/firefox/i'"  
see https://github.com/sebastianblum/symfony-standard/blob/routing-
condition/src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml
then I got the following error:
FatalErrorException: Error: Call to a member function getMethod() on a non-
object
