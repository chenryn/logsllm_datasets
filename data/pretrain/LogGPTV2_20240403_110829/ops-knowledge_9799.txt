User: I have converted a python script to .exe file. I just want to run the exe file from a VB script. Now the problem is that the python script accepts arguments during run-time (e.g.: serial port number, baud rate, etc.) and I cannot do the same with the .exe file. Can someone help me how to proceed?
Assistant: If you don't have the source to the python exe convertor and if the arguments don't need to change on each execution, you could probably open the exe in a debugger like ollydbg and search for shellexecute or createprocess and then create a string in a code cave and use that for the arguments. I think that's your only option.
Another idea: Maybe make your own extractor that includes the python script, vbscript, and python interpreter. You could just use a 7zip SFX or something.
