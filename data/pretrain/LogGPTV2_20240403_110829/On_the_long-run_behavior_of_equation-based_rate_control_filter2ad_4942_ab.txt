and c3 := 32c2 (for SQRT, let c2 = c3 = 0).
Note that, in view of (2), the throughput of both basic and com-
prehensive control is expressed in terms of the expected values of
some functions of the loss interval intervals θn, θn−1, . . . , θn−L.
Thus knowing the joint probability law of θn, θn−1, . . . , θn−L would,
at least in theory, enable one to compute the throughput, and ex-
plain how the correlation structure of the loss process plays a role.
3.2 Conditions for the Basic Control to be Con-
servative
We temporarily focus on the basic control. We give exact sufﬁ-
cient conditions for conservativeness, or non-conservativeness. The
results have interest of their own, and they also suggest the key fac-
tors that drive conservativeness.
3.2.1 A Sufﬁcient Condition for the Basic Control to
be Conservative
THEOREM 1. Assume that
(F1) the loss-throughput formula f is such that
with x,
(C1) cov0
T[θ0, ˆθ0] ≤ 0.
1
f (1/x) is convex
Then the basic control (3) is conservative.
Interpretation. The convexity condition (F1) is satisﬁed by the
SQRT loss throughput formula, and by PFTK-simpliﬁed; it is not
satisﬁed by PFTK-standard, but almost (we will come back to this
in a few lines). This is straightforward to demonstrate, and can
also be seen on Figure 1. The ﬁgure also shows that convexity is
much more pronounced for PFTK formulae, and thus, we should
expect more conservativeness with PFTK than with the square root
formula (this is conﬁrmed numerically in Section 1).
Condition (C1) is true in particular when the covariance is 0,
which happens when successive loss event intervals are (stochas-
tically) independent. There are indications in [20] that this my be
true, and the theorem says that this would lead to a conservative be-
havior. We show in appendix the following more explicit statement,
which gives a bound on long-run throughput:
E[X(0)] ≤ f (¯p)
1 + f(cid:1)( ¯p) ¯p3
f ( ¯p)

cov0
T[θ0, ˆθ0]
.
(10)
This shows that, in most cases, if the covariance is positive but
small, there cannot be any signiﬁcant non-conservativeness of the
basic protocol.

The theorem says more. Remember that ˆθn is an incremental
estimator of the loss event interval 1/¯p, built on the information
available up to the loss event n − 1, while θn is the true next loss
event interval. Both have the same expectation, as we assumed that
ˆθn is unbiased. However, this does not mean that ˆθn is a good
predictor of θn. This depends on the joint statistics, in particular
the autocovariance, of the loss process. The covariance of θn and
ˆθn reﬂects how good a predictor ˆθn is. Condition (C1) means that
ˆθn is a bad predictor, and, maybe surprisingly, the theorem suggests
that this leads to a conservative behavior. Conversely, consider now
a hypothetical case where the loss process goes into phases, with
slow transitions. Then the loss event interval becomes highly pre-
dictable; the theorem does not say that this alone will make the
control non-conservative. However, this may really happen, as we
ﬁnd in Section 3.4. We give another, perhaps more realistic exam-
ple in Section 3.2.2.
Note that ˆθn is the moving-average estimator in (2), and thus
cov0

in other words, it depends only on the spectral properties of the loss
event interval.
The following corollary was shown in the discussion above.
COROLLARY 1. If the convexity condition (F1) holds and the
loss event intervals are independent then the basic control (3) is
conservative.
When Convexity is Almost True.
The convexity condition
(F1) is not true for PFTK-standard (because of the min term), but
almost, as we see now. For a function g(x), we quantify its devia-
tion from convexity by the ratio to its convex closure
r = sup

The convex closure g
bounds g(x); it is obtained by applying convex conjugation twice
[16]. Fig. 2 shows g(x) = 1/f (1/x) for PFTK-standard and its
convex closure; here, we have r = 1.0026.

PROPOSITION 3. Assume that the loss-throughput formula f is
f (1/x) deviates from convexity by a ratio r, and that (C1)
such that
holds. Then the basic control (3) cannot overshoot by more than a
factor equal to r.
Thus, considering that a fraction of a percent is more than reason-
able accuracy, we can conclude that for practical purposes, we can
act as if PFTK-standard would satisfy the convexity condition F1.
3.2.2 When the sufﬁcient conditions do not hold
We give a different set of conditions, which provide additional
insights. The ﬁrst of these sets was found, in a restricted form, in
our previous work [17]. The second set applies to the cases where
Theorem 1 does not apply.
THEOREM 2. Assume that
(F2) the loss-throughput formula f is such that f (1/x) is concave
with x,
(C2) cov0
T[X0, S0] ≤ 0.
Then the basic control (3) is conservative.
Conversely, if
(F2c) the loss-throughput formula f is such that f (1/x) is strictly
convex with x,
T[X0, S0] ≥ 0,
(C2c) cov0
(V) the loss event estimator ˆθn has non-zero variance.
Then the basic control (3) is non-conservative.
Interpretation. The concavity condition (F2) is true for the square
root formula. In contrast, PFTK-standard and PFTK-simpliﬁed are
such that concavity (F2) is true for rare losses, but convexity (F2c)
is true for frequent losses (see Figure 1, lower graph). The covari-
ance condition (C2) is between Xn, the rate set at the occurrence
of the n-th loss event, and Sn, the time until the next loss event. If
the loss process is memoryless and independent of the activity of
our source, then the duration Sn of the loss interval is negatively
correlated with the send rate Xn in the given interval (since Sn is
counted in real time, not per packet); in such cases, condition (C2)
is true, and the basic control is conservative as long as losses are
rare to moderate (or if the SQRT formula is used). This part of
Theorem 2 complements Theorem 1.
Consider now the second part of Theorem 2. Assume that (Sn)n,
the sequence of loss event intervals counted in real time, is inde-
pendent of the send rate. This may happen for example for an au-
dio source that modulates its send rate by varying the packet size
rather than the packet send rate, and if the packet dropping prob-
ability in RED routers is independent of packet size. Then (C2c)
holds, with equality. Now assume also that PFTK-standard is used,
and the network setting happens to be such that the loss event in-
terval θn is mostly in the region where PFTK-standard is convex
(i.e. heavy losses). The theorem says that the basic control is non-
conservative, except in the degenerate case where there is no ran-
domness in the system, i.e.
the loss estimator has converged to
a constant value. We show simulations that illustrate this case in
Section 4.
Another example is for a more traditional source such as TFRC,
but when the loss process goes through phases (for example, the
network paths used by the ﬂow oscillate between congestion and
no congestion), and the sending rate roughly follow the phases (i.e.,
is responsive at the time scale of the loss process). Then when
the network is in the congestion phase, Xn is most often small,
and because of congestion, Sn is small. In such a case, condition
(C2c) may be true and the basic control may not be conservative.
In Section 3.4 we show such cases.
Comments. From a methodology viewpoint, the ﬁrst part of
Theorem 2 illustrates well the importance of the Feller paradox-
type of the arguments used in this paper. The send rate X(t) is
updated only at the loss events times (Tn)n. Consider an observer
who picks up a point in time at random; she is more likely to fall
in a large loss event time Sn. Given that Sn is negatively corre-
lated with Xn, it is thus more likely that on average she will ob-
serve a smaller rate than another observer that would sample the
rate at (Tn)n. From this we conclude E[X(0)] ≤ E0
[X0] (The
concavity assumption (F2), by Jensen’s inequality, shows in turn
[X0] ≤ f (¯p), thus ﬁnally E[X(0)] ≤ f (¯p) and the control
that E0
T
is conservative).
T
The main result in our previous work [17] is similar to the ﬁrst
part of Theorem 2, but with the correlation condition (C2) replaced
by the condition that the expected duration Sn, conditional to the
rate Xn, decreases with Xn:
(C3) E0
T
It is a direct consequence of Harris’ inequality3 (see for example
[1], p. 225) that (C3) implies the negative correlation condition
(C2); thus our previous result is a special case of the ﬁrst part of
Theorem 2.
[S0|X0 = x] is non-increasing with x.
Of course, we should expect that the combination of (C2c) and
(V) implies that (C1) does not hold. This indeed holds and is shown
in the appendix.
It is legitimate to wonder whether Theorem 1 is derived from
Theorem 2 or vice versa. It does not seem to be the case (we discuss
this in the appendix). Note however that if the concavity condition
(F2) holds, then the convexity condition (F1) necessarily also holds
(but the converse is not true).
3.3 What This Tells Us
The analytical results in the previous section are for the basic
control. We expect the comprehensive control to give a slightly
higher throughput, since it differs by an additional increase during
long loss event intervals. This motivates us to pose as assumptions
the following analysis, which we will conﬁrm later in the paper by
numerical experiments and ns simulations.
CLAIM 1. Assume that the loss event interval θn and the loss
event interval estimator ˆθn are lightly or negatively correlated.
Consider the region where the loss event interval estimator ˆθn takes
f (1/x) is in this region, the more con-
its values. The more convex
servative the control is. The more variable ˆθn is, the more conser-
vative the control is.

Application. For protocols like TFRC, we expect the condition
to hold in many practical cases [20]. For the three functions we
f (1/x) is more convex for small x, that is,
consider in this paper,
for large loss event ratios ¯p. Thus, the control should be more con-
servative with heavy loss than low loss. This effect is more pro-
nounced for PFTK-standard (6) and PFTK-simpliﬁed (7), which
3Harris’ inequality says that if f (x) and g(x) are non-decreasing
functions, and X is one random variable, then the covariance of
f (X) and g(X) is non-negative.
107are convex and very steep for large ¯p, than for SQRT. This explains
the observed drop in throughput for the control, with PFTK and
heavy losses.
The variability of ˆθn depends on the variability of (θn)n, and
can be controlled by the length of the moving-average estimator ˆθn
(2). With some proper setting of the weights (wl)L
l=1, the larger the
length of the estimator L, the smaller the variability of the estimator
ˆθn (for instance, for ﬁnite-variance (θn)n, and uniform weights
wl = 1/L, l = 1, 2, . . . , L, variance of ˆθn scales as O(1/L)). We
should ﬁnd that for larger L the control becomes less conservative.
The second claim concerns a case where the conditions in Claim
1 do not hold.
CLAIM 2.
• Assume that duration in real time of the loss event interval
Sn and the send rate Xn are negatively or non correlated.
If f (1/x) is concave in the region where the loss event in-
terval estimator ˆθn takes its values, the control tends to be
conservative.
• Conversely, if Sn and Xn are positively or non correlated,
and if f (1/x) is strictly convex in the region where the loss
event interval estimator ˆθn takes its values, and (θn)n is not
ﬁxed to some constant, the control is non-conservative.
In both cases, the more variable ˆθn is, the more pronounced the
effect is.
Application. We expect to have a close to zero correlation for
adaptive audio applications such as [4] when packet losses in RED
routers are independent of packet size. Thus, depending on which
convexity condition holds, we will ﬁnd one or the other outcome.
For SQRT, the control should always be conservative. The same
holds for PFTK with light to moderate losses. The opposite holds
for either PFTK formulae with heavy losses (loss event ratio larger
than 0.1).
3.4 Numerical Examples
We now support some of the observations we made from our
analytical study by numerical examples. Such a numerical study
enables us to isolate individual factors that we expect to contribute
to either conservative or non-conservative behavior. We show later
in Section 4 the results of ns simulations.
All results in this section are based on numerical investigations
of the basic control and the comprehensive control, with functions
SQRT or PFTK-simpliﬁed. For PFTK-standard, we rely on ns sim-
ulations shown in Section 4; in view of the claims, the results do
not differ signiﬁcantly.
3.5 Validation of Claim 1
We consider independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) (θn)n
with marginal density function µ(x) = λ exp(−λ(x − x0)), for
x ≥ x0, and λ, x0 ≥ 0; µ is known as generalized exponential
distribution.
We explain why we choose the density function µ. µ has some

that µ gives us a freedom to vary either E0
T[θ0], while the

other of these two parameters is kept ﬁxed. At the same time, skew-
ness and kurtosis parameters remain unchanged. Thus µ enables us
to separate the effects due to convexity of 1/f (1/x) and variability
of ˆθn. With some other distributions, for instance, the geometrical
distribution P(θ0 = k) = ¯p(1 − ¯p)k−1, k ≥ 1, we would have
1 − ¯p. In this case, the variability of (ˆθn)n would

butions we may be able to ﬁx cv0
T[θ0], but not at the same time the
kurtosis parameter that reﬂects the peakedness of the distribution,
and thus the variability of (ˆθn)n.
We compute the throughput E[X(0)] numerically for the basic
and comprehensive control from Equation (8) and (9), respectively.
The results are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation; out of 5 inde-
pendent simulations runs each with 10000 samples, and 0.95 con-
ﬁdence intervals.

(resp. ¯x > 1 to non-conservative behavior).
Ideally, we would
have ¯x = 1. For SQRT function, we observe, for each ﬁxed value
of length L of the estimator ˆθn, ¯x is around the same value irrespec-
tive of ¯p. This constancy of ¯x with respect to ¯p is to be expected.
