disease susceptibility models. Since the input is a binary
vector, we de(cid:12)ne the adjacent datasets as two vectors whose
attribute values are the same except one attribute. The
global sensitivity of model f is given as maxi jwij. Based
on the sensitivity method, the Laplace mechanism Mϵ adds
Laplace noise Lap(0; b) to predicted susceptibility f (x). The
range of the susceptibility is bounded. To avoid the output
of the Laplace mechanism takes a value outside of the range,
the output is rounded as a postprocess. This rounding pro-
cess is called cutoﬀ.

In Fig. 9a, when (cid:11) = 0:2, the inclusion probability is al-
most equal to 1:0 for all ϵ. This means that the output
of the both mechanisms almost distributes in the same re-
gion with probability 1. Now that diﬀerential privacy oﬀers
stronger privacy guarantee than (cid:11)-obscure privacy, the dif-
ferentially private mechanism is preferred in the setting. In
the same (cid:12)gure, when (cid:11) = 0:4, the inclusion probability is
less than 0:1 for ϵ = 0:1. This means that the output of the
0.1-diﬀerentially private mechanism is located the outside
of the interval of the 0.4-optimal interval mechanism with
probability 0.9.
In this setting, we can see that the 0.4-
optimal interval mechanism gives much better utility than
0.1-diﬀerentially private mechanism.
Fig. 9b depicts the same inclusion probability, but the
x-axis is set to the expected interval width of the optimal
interval mechanism. In this (cid:12)gure, for example, we can see
that when the expected interval width of the intervals that
the optimal interval mechanism outputs are 0.4 (between
(cid:0)2), the inclusion probability that 0.1-diﬀerentially
(cid:0)1 and 2

private mechanism gives outputs in the interval with length
0.4 is less than 0.2.
As we see from the both (cid:12)gures, the outputs of diﬀeren-
tially private mechanisms distribute broadly with high prob-
ability even with large ϵ, and useful outputs are obtained
with very low probability. Thus, particularly when large
deviation from the true output is not acceptable, the opti-

attribute. This control helps us to avoid unique identi(cid:12)ca-
tion of inputs.
7.3 Empirical Analysis of Computational Ef-
ﬁciency
⊺
We analyze the computational eﬃciency of the proposed
algorithm empirically using synthetic datasets. In these ex-
periments, we used a linear function f (x) = w
x for which
the input dimension is d and the input domain X is f0; 1gd.
Here, w was set as a random vector drawn from the uniform
distribution over [0; 1]d. The signi(cid:12)cant digits of w were
set to 10. For each i, the prior probability Pr [Xi = 1] was
set as a random value drawn from the uniform distribution
over [0; 1]. In addition, (cid:11)i was chosen from the uniform dis-
tribution over [0; 1]. We randomly generate w; (cid:11) and prior
probabilities for each trial and evaluated the computation
time necessary to build the optimal partitioning (cid:25)
with the
change of the input dimension as d = 1; :::; 12. We imple-
mented the algorithm with Rust language [4]. The program
was run on a personal computer with an Intel Xeon 2.60
GHz CPU and 32GB RAM. No parallelization technique
was used.
(cid:3)
In Fig 7, we present the average computation time of 100
trials. As the (cid:12)gure shows, the calculation time is exponen-
tial in d. When the input dimension is 12, the calculation
time is about 15,400 s (≃ 4 h).
In general, the number of SNPs is quite large (e.g. 3 mil-
lion). We do not claim that our algorithm always works in
a practical time when the input dimension is large. How-
ever, the number of SNPs that are fundamentally necessary
for medical applications is not typically that large because
only a limited number of genetic features typically aﬀect on
our constitutions or traits. In the drug administration ex-
ample [7], only two SNPs were used to evaluate the proper
dosage of warfarin. In the disease susceptibility models of
obesity used for these experiments, 10 SNPs, were used as
inputs after a proper screening process. In addition, once
the optimal interval is built, the mechanism can provide an
output of the model using the interval repeatedly. Consid-
ering these points, there remains room for improvement of
the computation time. However, our algorithm can be suf-
(cid:12)ciently practical with real-world applications.
7.4 Empirical Comparison of Utility to Differ-
ential Privacy
We compare our optimal interval mechanism to the Laplace
541mal interval mechanism with (cid:11)-obscure privacy can be an
alternative.
8. CONCLUSION
As described in this paper, we de(cid:12)ned the input inference
problem in which the input domain is (cid:12)nite and discrete.
Also, we introduced (cid:11)-obscure privacy as the measure of
the input inference risk. Taking genome-based disease sus-
ceptibility predictors as an example, we demonstrated that
disclosure of raw susceptibility values is equivalent in some
cases to publishing the input value. Using an existing ob-
fuscation method (equally partitioning mechanism), we con-
(cid:12)rmed that the input can be uniquely determined even when
the output is obfuscated with a large interval.
We show that designing a mechanism that achieves (cid:11)-
obscure privacy is equivalent to a constrained optimization
problem of partitioning of the input domain. Based on
this understanding, we designed a mechanism that releases
optimal intervals instead of output values. The computa-
tional complexity of our algorithm is exponential in the in-
put dimension; improvement of the optimization algorithm
remains as our future work.
In this paper, we considered interval release for a single
function while interval release for multiple functions is of-
ten required for real-world applications (e.g., disease sus-
ceptibilities to several common diseases).
In such a case,
the mechanism needs to output a cuboid that ensures (cid:11)-
obscure privacy. Most of the discussions related to Theorem
1 hold for the multiple output case; however, the optimal
cuboid release is a far more diﬃcult problem than the opti-
mal interval release problem. Eﬃcient solutions for optimal
cuboid release remains as future work.

A. ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS IN CERE-
BRAL HEMORRHAGE
We experimentally evaluated privacy and utility of the
optimal interval mechanism and equally partitioned mech-
anism with the susceptibility model of cerebral hemorrhage
(Fig. 10-12). Also, comparison to diﬀerential privacy in the
same model is shown in Fig. 13. We can con(cid:12)rm that our
mechanism also achieves better utility-privacy trade-oﬀ with
the susceptibility model of cerebral hemorrhage, too.
