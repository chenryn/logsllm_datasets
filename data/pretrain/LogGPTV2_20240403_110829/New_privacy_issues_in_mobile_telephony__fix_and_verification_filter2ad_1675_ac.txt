the victim is indeed in the femtocell area. Otherwise, the
attacker needs to inject the same message to the other mo-
bile stations in his area in order to ﬁnd out if the victim MS
is present or not.
The 3G AKA protocol is performed at each new session
in the femtocell setting, this makes the caching of the au-
thentication parameters very easy. Though, we do not have
the tools to test if this applies when connecting to a typical
Node B, we tested the 3G/GSM interoperability scenario
by using the Osmocom-BB software and we observed that
in this setting the execution of the AKA protocol can be
triggered by calling for example the victim mobile phone a
given number of times (by hanging up within a short time
window this activity can be made non detectable by the vic-
tim [20]). For instance, our experiments showed that the
execution of the AKA protocol on the UK Vodafone net-
work can be triggered by calling six times the victim mobile
phone, and hanging up before it even rings.
To illustrate the use of our attacks, consider an employer
interested in tracking one of his employee’s accesses to a
building. He would ﬁrst use the femtocell to sniﬀ a valid au-
thentication request. This could happen in a diﬀerent area
than the monitored one. Then the employer would position
the device near the entrance of the building. Movements
inside the building could be tracked as well by placing addi-
tional devices to cover diﬀerent areas of the building. Sim-
ilarly, these attacks could be used to collect large amount
of data on users’ movements in deﬁned areas for proﬁling
purposes, as an example of how mobile systems have al-
ready been exploited in this direction is available in [1] If
devices with wider area coverage than a femtocell are used,
the adversary should use triangulation to obtain ﬁner posi-
tion data.
5. PRIVACY PRESERVING FIXES
Despite the use of temporary identities to avoid linkability
and to ensure anonymity of 3G subscribers, active attackers
can rely on the paging procedure to break both anonymity
and unlinkability. Moreover, the AKA protocol provides a
way to trace 3G subscribers without the need to identify
them in any way. As described in the previous section, these
two attacks on privacy can be implemented using cheap de-
vices which are widely available. This shows that the anal-
ysed procedures are a real threat for the users’ privacy, and
countermeasures should be promptly taken to provide an
eﬀectively privacy friendly mobile telephony system.
In this section we propose a set of countermeasures involv-
ing symmetric and public key-based cryptography. The pub-
lic key infrastructure we propose is lightweight and easy to
deploy because we only require one public/private key pair
per mobile network operator, and none for the mobile sta-
tions. More generally, the solutions we present require only
small changes to the current security architecture and to the
cryptographic functions currently used in 3G. Hence we be-
lieve our solutions may be implemented in a cost-eﬀective
way, and thus could realistically be adopted by the telecom-
munication operators.
In addition to the solutions proposed to ﬁx the IMSI pag-
ing and the AKA protocol, in this section we give a pri-
vacy friendly version of the identiﬁcation procedure to ﬁx
the IMSI catcher attack. Indeed, the problem of privacy is
a multilayer/multiprotocol problem [13] which requires all
protocols at all layers to satisfy the desired properties. Even

though, the analysis from the user privacy point of view of
the entire set of 3G protocols cannot be tackled in a single
paper, we cannot ignore the best known privacy issue of mo-
bile telecommunication systems. For this reason, we include
a ﬁxed version of the identiﬁcation procedure in our privacy
friendly solutions.
5.1 Lightweight Public Key Infrastructure
We propose the adoption of a lightweight public key infras-
tructure (PKI) providing each MNO with a private/public
key pair. The public key of a network provider can be stored
in the USIM. This public key makes it possible for a mo-
bile station to encrypt privacy related information such as
the IMSI, and deliver them to the network in a conﬁden-
tial manner. We do not require a public/private key pair
to be assigned to the mobile stations. The adoption of such
a lightweight PKI can also solve the problem exposed by
Zhang and Fang in [36] concerning the lack of serving net-
work authentication in the current infrastructure.
5.2 Protecting the IMSI Paging Procedure
To protect the paging procedure, we propose to encrypt
the paging request using a shared session key U K, which
we call unlinkability key. This key is generated by apply-
ing a new one-way keyed function f to the long-term key
KIMSI , and a random number rand contained in the paging
request. This key should be used for privacy preserving pur-
poses only. Furthermore, we require the encrypted request
message to include a random challenge chall and a sequence
number SQN . The network stores the random challenge
and checks it against the one sent by the MS in the paging
response (Figure 6). The aim of the SQN is to ensure fresh-
ness of the paging request and avoid replay attacks. The
SQN should be handled in the same way as in the AKA
protocol. A MS receiving a legitimate IMSI paging request
should discard it if the SQN is not in the correct range.
The use of this procedure should still be kept minimal (pre-
ferring the paging with TMSI whenever possible) to avoid
burdening the signalling communication with cryptographic
operations. In fact, each MS has to decrypt and check all
the received IMSI paging to determine if it is the recipient.
5.3 Fixing the AKA Protocol
The AKA protocol is a threat for the unlinkability of 3G
subscribers because the error messages sent in case of au-
new RAN D

M AC ← f1KIM SI (SQNN ||RAN D)

thentication failure leak information about the identity of
the subscriber. To avoid this information leakage, the er-
ror messages sent in case of any type of failure should look
indistinguishable from an attacker’s point of view.
Moreover, the 3G standard stipulates [6] diﬀerent proce-
dures to recover from each of the two kinds of failure, but this
is a source of additional information ﬂow that can be used
to launch our privacy attack.
In the solution we propose
we solve this problem since error recovery can be performed
within the network without the need to trigger further pro-
cedures on the air.
Indeed, all the parameters needed for
error recovery are sent in the error message allowing the
recovery procedure to be carried within the network.
The ﬁxed version of the AKA protocol (Figure 7) carries
on as speciﬁed by the standard, the network sends RAND,
AUTN and waits for a response. The response is RES =
f2KIMSI (RAND), as in the standard, in case the checks of
MAC and sequence number are successful. If either of these
checks fails, an error message is sent to the network. The
failure message is now encrypted with the public key of the
network pbN , and contains a constant Fail, the IMSI, and
the current sequence number SQN M S of the MS. The IMSI
sent encrypted in the error message allows the network to
check the identity of the MS without triggering the iden-
tiﬁcation procedure. The current sequence number of the
mobile station enables the network to perform resynchroni-
sation with the Authentication Centre (AuC, the server stor-
ing subscribers authentication data) of the operator of the
mobile station, if needed. SQN M S is sent encrypted with the
unlinkability key (as deﬁned in the ﬁxed paging procedure)
in order to authenticate the error message to the Network
as coming from the MS with permanent identity IMSI . The

Network can deduce the cause of the failure from the IMSI
and SQNMS contained in the error message. Upon receipt of
this authentication failure message the action performed for
error recovery purposes should be the same regardless of the
type of failure occurred. Indeed any diﬀerence in behaviour
would be a source of additional information ﬂows.
5.4 Protecting the Identiﬁcation Procedure
The identiﬁcation procedure exposes the IMSI of a MS
(the IMSI is sent in cleartext upon request by the network).
Hence, it breaches both anonymity and unlinkability. Ac-
cording to the standard, the use of the identiﬁcation pro-
cedure should be limited as much as possible, to avoid a
passive attacker overhearing the IMSI. However, the cost of
devices allowing active attacks is constantly decreasing. As
a consequence, enhancing the protocol to protect the IMSI
is vital to ensure privacy.
The ﬁxed version of the identiﬁcation procedure (Figure 8)
involves two messages: the ﬁrst is sent by the network to
ask for the IMSI, the second, the identity response, is the
randomised encryption of the IMSI of the mobile station
using the public counterpart (pbN ) of the private key of the
network operator (pvN ).
5.5 Discussion of the Proposed Fixes
While the ﬁx we propose for the identiﬁcation procedure
is intuitive and straightforward, this is not the case for the
other two procedures. In particular, we take care of main-
taining the style of mobile telecommunication protocols and
at the same time ensuring privacy. We introduce the un-
linkability key, a new session key generated for privacy pur-
poses, instead of using the long term key KIM SI (as in the
3G AKA), and make use of the sequence number SQN for
freshness purposes (this is needed to avoid user linkability
caused by replay attacks); We maintain the authentication
ﬂow of the AKA and modify only the way error messages
are dealt with by including error recovery information inside
the error message (this avoids the triggering by the network
of diversiﬁed procedures in order to perform error recovery).
Our proposed ﬁxes use public-key cryptography; intuitively,
there is no way to avoid that, since if a mobile station’s TMSI
is unknown to the serving network (hence the need to per-
form the identiﬁcation procedure) then there is no shared
key by which they can communicate privately. The addi-
tional costs associated with deploying and using public-key
cryptography are in fact small for the two following reasons.
Firstly, only mobile telephony operators are required to
have a public/private key pair. Neither subscribers, nor mo-
bile phone equipments nor USIMs need to have their own
public/private key pair. The operator’s public key could be
stored in the USIM of the mobile station, as it is already
the case for the IMSI and the long-term key KIM SI . The
Home Network can act as a certifying authority for the pub-
lic key of the diﬀerent Serving Networks (see below). Thus,
the public key infrastructure is similar to that used on the
web, where corporations (not users) have certiﬁed keys.
Secondly, the computationally expensive public-key en-
cryption and decryption are required only for the identiﬁ-
cation protocol and when the AKA-protocol fails. The exe-
cution of the identiﬁcation and the IMSI paging procedures
should anyway be kept minimal according to the currently
deployed standard. Moreover, failures during the execution
of the AKA-protocol rarely occur according to our experi-
ments. Hence, the computational overhead of the public-key
cryptography is not signiﬁcant. Moreover, it is possible to
delegate the encryption and decryption to the mobile equip-
ment, instead of executing them on the USIM. This would
not weaken the security properties of the 3G procedure, since
the mobile equipment in the current architecture has already
access to the IMSI, while the network public key is publicly
available information.
For roaming purposes, each Home Network (HN) can act
as certifying authority of the Serving Network (SN) for its
own subscribers. The public key pbHN of the HN could be
stored in the USIM. At registration time with a SN, the MS
would declare its HN, and the SN would provide the MS
with its public key pbSN , together with a certiﬁcate from
the mobile station’s HN (signskHN (pbSN )). Hence, a mobile
station would only need to obtain a certiﬁed version of the
SN’s public key, and verify it using its own network provider
public key. This would provide, in a eﬃcient way, the MS
with the necessary public keys to execute our ﬁxed versions
of the protocols.
The introduction of cryptographic operations on the mo-
bile equipment side could be a source of Denial of Service
(DoS) attacks aiming to consume the battery load of vic-
tim MSs. To mitigate the eﬀect of such attacks, the mo-
bile phone’s software could rate limit the phone’s willingness
to respond to authentication, IMSI paging and identity re-
quest messages, so to guarantee a minimum battery life-time
even in case of attempted DoS attacks. We have calculated
that responding to such requests on average once per minute
would consume an additional one tenth of battery life.
6. VERIFICATION
Many deployed protocols have subsequently been found
to be ﬂawed [27, 18, 12, 16].
In this perspective and in
order to increase the conﬁdence one can have in the solutions
proposed at the previous section, we formally analyse our
proposed ﬁxes w.r.t. privacy. We present the results of the
automatic veriﬁcation of the privacy-friendly enhancement
discussed in Section 5. Table 1 summarises these results
which apply for the protocols running both in parallel and
in isolation. We use the ProVerif tool [15] to verify the
unlinkability and anonymity properties of our ﬁxes for the
3G procedures exposing the IMSI (identiﬁcation and paging)
and the 3G AKA protocol. We use the formalisation of
privacy-related properties as given by Arapinis et al. in [11],
