User: I am working with some C code called from Python using ctypes.  Somewhere in the bowels of the C library, an exception is occurring and/or abort() is being called.  Is there any way I can catch this in my Python caller code? (Platform is Linux)
Assistant: You might be able to setup a signal handler on SIGABRT to handle the signal caused by abort().
However, failed assertions might go along with corrupted memory and other bad things - there's usually a reason why an assertion failed. So usually terminating the applications is the best thing you can do (except displaying/logging an error in your handler before terminating).
