User: I am running a shell command from within my python script using
os.system("some shell command")
This command essentially terminates a tool.
I need to check that this tool is terminated in my script.
But as soon as the tool is terminated the script is terminated too!
Assistant: Is the script, by any chance, launched by that same tool? If yes, you need to run os.setsid() to stop being dependent on it.
