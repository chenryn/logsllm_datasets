In the cpp backend, undefined Tensors are used to efficiently represent a
Tensor full of `0`s.  
Even though we do support this in many functions, there are a lot that almost
never get undefined gradients and are thus not properly implemented:
  * All the backwards with direct formulas in `derivatives.yaml`
  * Most functions in `Functions.cpp`.
In particular, the assumption that a function with a single output cannot get
undefined gradients is not correct.  
An example of such issue can be found in #33037 and #32619
