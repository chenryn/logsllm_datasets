are a function of the destination AS) currently is vulnerable
to two relay-level attacks: (1) it is possible for a middle-relay
in an Astoria constructed circuit to narrow down the set of
possible (source, destination) AS pairs that are at either end
of the circuit (based on the selected entry- and exit-relays),
and (2) when Astoria is used from regions with no safe (entry,

Load balancing. Astoria aims to balance load from clients
across all relays in the Tor network so that no single set of
relays are overloaded. Figure 12 demonstrates the closeness
of the load-balancing of the Astoria client with the vanilla Tor
client and the perfect load-balancing client. We see that in
spite of performing AS-aware relay-selection, Astoria is able
to perform load-balancing at least as well as the vanilla Tor
client, with neither of them achieving a perfect distribution.
The results of this experiment allow us to conﬁrm our
hypothesis that the reduction in performance from the vanilla
Tor client to Astoria is indeed because of our inability to
preconstruct circuits and delays due to path computation, and
not due to poor relay-selection.
Overhead of path prediction. Figure 13 shows the CDF of
the total amount of time spent on computing AS paths, for each
site. We see that for about 50% of all sites (200 sites in each of
10 countries), the time spent on path computation is negligible.
This is due to the high frequency of repeated occurrences of
destination ASes in our 200 sites – resulting in the AS path for
each exit-relay to that destination already being in the toolkit’s
cache. In 60% of the cases where responses were not cached
(and 86% of the cases, overall), computing AS paths required
under 4 seconds.
C. Security against network-level attackers
In this section, Astoria is evaluated and compared with the
vanilla Tor client by measuring its success in defending against
various attackers performing asymmetric correlation attacks. A
summary of all results are provided in Table III.

exit) relay options, it is possible for a relay-level attacker to
force Astoria to create circuits that can be de-anonymized by
it. Below, we discuss these attacks, their impact, and how to
mitigate them.
Measuring the threat posed by middle-relays. As seen in
Table III, in a majority of all cases, Astoria is able to ﬁnd
a safe pair of entry- and exit-relays to use for its circuits.
As a result, an adversarial middle-relay working under the
assumption that Astoria always constructs safe circuits, will
be able to narrow down the set of possible source- and
destination-ASes by simply observing the entry- and exit-
relays in the circuit. Below, using the results of experiment
E2 and statistical inference techniques, we show that the threat
from such adversarial relays is negligible.
First, given our random sample of 100 source ASes for
each country (and ﬁxed set of destinations) we infer the
mean number of (source, destination) pairs with greater than
50% safe entry- and exit-relay pair options for the entire
population of source ASes in each country (with the same
ﬁxed destinations). Then, we ﬁnd a lower-bound estimate on
the expected number of (source, destination) AS pairs that have
each (entry, exit) pair as a safe option – i.e., a lower-bound on
the number of (source, destination) pairs that can be linked to
the circuit by a middle-relay in a single observation. Finally,
we show that given the current distribution of Tor relays, the
probability of narrowing down this set of sources to a single
(source, destination) pair is negligible.
Inferring the mean number of (source, destination) pairs
with greater than 50% safe options. Recall that in experiment
E2, 100 source ASes were selected at random from the set
of all ASes in each country. The experiment considers the
destination ASes generated by the loading of 200 non-random
destinations. Let the set of sampled source ASes be denoted

From
the results of the experiment, we extract the mean fraction of
(¯x ∈ ¯X, d ∈ D) pairs which have more than 50% safe entry-
and exit-relay options (denoted by µ ¯X,D). Let X denote the
set of all ASes within each country. Now, using the central
limit theorem and the sampling distribution of the sample
means [34], we infer the 99% conﬁdence-interval for the mean
fraction of (x ∈ X, d ∈ D) pairs which have more than 50%
safe entry- and exit-relay options (denoted by µX,D).
Estimating a lower-bound on linkable sources. We take an
extremely conservative approach to derive this lower-bound.
First, we use the lower value of µX,D from our 99% conﬁdence
interval. Further, we assume that µX,D fraction of our (x ∈ X,
d ∈ D) pairs have only exactly 50% safe entry- and exit-
relay options (although µX,D denotes the fraction of (x ∈ X,
d ∈ D) pairs with greater than 50% safe options). Finally,
we assume that the remaining 1 − µX,D fraction of (x ∈ X,
d ∈ D) pairs have no safe options. Given these assumptions,
we can compute the lower-bound on the expected number
of (x ∈ X, d ∈ D) pairs which have each (entry, exit)
pair as a safe option (denoted by E[Sen,ex]) as: E[Sen,ex]
=
Total (entry, exit) pairs = .50 × µX,D × |X| × |D|.
E[Sen,ex] is a lower-bound on the expected number of
linkable source and destination pairs for each observation of
an entry- and exit-relay (under the conservative assumption
that an adversarial middle-relay knows the country in which
the client is located and the set of all possible destinations D
that any client may connect to).
Total safe circuits
Estimating the probability of complete de-anonymization.
Given that E[Sen,ex] is the number of (x ∈ X, d ∈ D) pairs
that are linkable to a single observation of an (entry, exit)
pair and assuming a constant rate of reduction in linkable
pairs (given by E[Sen,ex]
|X|×|D| ), the number of circuits that need
to be observed by the adversarial middle-relay to narrow
down the number of (x ∈ X, d ∈ D) pairs to 1 – i.e., to
completely de-anonymize the source and destination – is n =
log(E[Sen,ex])−log(|X|×|D|) (since ( E[Sen,ex]
|X|×|D| )n =
− log(|X|×|D|)
1
|X|×|D|).
Since Astoria (1) constructs new circuits only if there are
no existing circuits that serve the same destination AS, and
(2) selects middle-relays for each new circuit according the
the bandwidth distribution of relays, we obtain the expected
upper-bound of the probability of a middle-relay being able
to observe n circuits between the same source and destination
ASes (with different entry- and exit-relays). Table IV shows
that this probability (denoted by Pn) is negligible even for the
Tor relay with the current highest advertised bandwidth where
the probability of selection as the middle-relay is .007.
Defending against attacks due to predictable relay-selection
when there are no safe options.
In certain client locations
(e.g., some ASes in China and Iran), there are no safe entry-
and exit-relay selections for some destinations, regardless of
the guards used by the client. In these cases, a relay-level
adversary may place entry-and exit-relays in ASes that provide
a safe-path for Astoria clients attempting to connect to speciﬁc
target destinations. This manipulates Astoria into using the
adversarial (entry, exit) pair on all circuits connecting the client
to the target destination – allowing trivial de-anonymization of
the user.

TABLE IV: Results from statistical analysis of the expected upper-
bound of the threat posed by adversarial middle-relays on Astoria
(using data obtained from our simulation experiment (E2).
Astoria can defend against such attacks by selecting from
safe (entry, exit) pairs only when a minimum threshold of
available safe (entry, exit) pairs is met. In cases where the
threshold is not met, Astoria may discard the few remaining
safe pairs and choose entry- and exit-relays according to the
distribution produced by its linear program (Eq. 2), which
minimizes the amount of information gained by the network-
level adversary. This however, enables correlation attacks by
