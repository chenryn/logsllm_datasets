### Code Sample
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the Excel file
df = pd.read_excel('Financial_Sample1.xlsx')

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

### Problem Description
I have encountered an issue with the `read_excel` function in pandas. The function is not reading the entire content of cells that contain more than 45 characters. For example, if a cell in the Excel sheet contains the text "this is github and i am posting an issue here about pandas so i want the solution", the `read_excel` function reads it as "his is github and i am posting an issue here about pandas . . .". This truncation of data is problematic because it results in incomplete and inaccurate data being loaded into the DataFrame.

I am attaching a sample Excel file (`sample.xlsx`) that I used for extracting data, which contains many cells with more than 45 characters.

**Why This Is a Problem:**
- The current behavior of truncating long strings in cells leads to loss of important information.
- This can cause significant issues in data analysis and processing, as the data is not fully represented.

**Expected Output:**
The `read_excel` function should read the entire content of each cell, regardless of the length of the text, and load it accurately into the DataFrame.
