#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
    # Your code here
    import pandas as pd
    df =pd.read_excel('Financial Sample1.xlsx')
    print (df)
#### Problem description
I have already posted my issue before. The read_excel function is not able to
read the excel sheet is only reading a part of the cells which has more than
45 characters in it. for example if the excel cell has the data : " this is
github and i am posting an issue here about pandas so i want the solution"
then it reads as follows: "his is github and i am posting an issue here about
pandas . . . ". so the data in the cells which has lot of characters is
getting trimmed.  
sample.xlsx.
I am attaching the excel file which i used for extracting data in which many
cells have data more than 45 characters.
[this should explain **why** the current behaviour is a problem and why the
expected output is a better solution.]
