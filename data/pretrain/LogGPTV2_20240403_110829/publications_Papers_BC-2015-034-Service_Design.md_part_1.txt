Sofar,thestoryhasemphasizedaspectssuchasmeetingcustomers’expectations,
handlingexceptions,andavoidingdisappointments. But,designingaserviceto
provide positive experiences includes the opportunity to delight customers, e.g.
tooffermorethantheyexpected,orconductaserviceinamoreconvenientway.
Nowadays, the term service design is often used with a broader meaning. But,
if service design is about improving or even creating new services in order to
positivelysurprisecustomers,thetermsservicedesign,newservicedevelopment,
andserviceinnovationstarttoconceptuallyoverlap.
Hence,thissectionwillshedsomelightonthedefinitionsandkeycharacteristics
ofservicedesignanddiscussitsrelationtotheothertwoconcepts. Thefollowing
sectionsofthischapterwillthenintroducemethodsusedforservicedesignand
toolsthathelpapplyingthesemethodsinprojects.

people have in mind when talking about services. This leaves the second term,

design of products, communication design, web design, software or IT-system
design, and even (design) methods themselves. Furthermore, design is a verb

Surprisingly or perhaps not surprisingly, given the variety of contexts, scholars
struggletoagreeonashareddefinitionfortheterm[3]. Hence,duetothecontext-
boundnatureoftheterm,subsequentfocuslaysonhowtheservicecommunity
definesandusesthetermservicedesign.
Earlypublicationsonthetopicofservicedesignfocusonthemodelingand
description of services, e.g., blueprinting of services [2]. Correspondingly, and
similartoourdiscussionintheopeningcase,theirdefinitionsofthetermservice
designemphasizethedescriptionofaserviceconceptprimarilythroughvisualiza-
tions. Furtherdefinitionsarebroaderandrefertotheprocessofcreatingaconcept
fora(new)serviceincludingtheearlycreativestepstocomeupwithanideafora
newservice[4]. Someauthorsfromthelate1990sandearly2000sspecifywhat
a service concept should look like (e.g., [5, 6]). According to them the service

Sincethefirstservicedesignresearchersoriginatedfromvariousdesignback-
grounds, service design was influenced by a wide range of design disciplines.
Therefore,theconceptofservicedesignbecamebroaderandrecentpublications
defineservicedesignastheprocessof“systematicallyapplyingdesignmethods
andprinciplestothedesignofservices”[7].
In an overview on service design as a field of research, Blomkvist et al. [8]

Meanwhile,researchbecamemuchwideranddeeperandnowdealswithservicede-
signitself,e.g.,reflectingonunderlyingtheories,exploringnewdesigntechniques,
analyzingcasestudies,ormovingtowardsproduct-servicesystems.
Given the diversity of the research field of service design, synonyms and
variations to the term service design have emerged and are worth highlighting.
Building on the close relation of service design and design thinking [9, 10] – a
similarapproachoriginatingfromproductinnovation–someauthorshaveframed
thetermservicedesignthinking[11]. Moreover,otherresearchersemphasizethat

Servicedesignersaimtounderstandandimproveserviceexperiencesbyfo-
cusingoncustomersandtheirinteractionswithaserviceprovider. Inmoredetail,
professionalsagreeonthefollowingcornerstones([11,13,17,18]):
• Human-centric
• Interactive
• Holistic
• Iterative
• Prototype-based

on market niches, key resources of an organization, revenue models or whole
businessmodels. Intermsofcustomers,itiscommonpracticetodefinecustomer
segments which are then used in the innovation process. Service design takes
a slightly different but complementary approach: It looks at customers on an
individuallevelratherthanonasegmentlevel. Thismeans,servicedesignersput
themselvesintotheshoesofacustomerorotherstakeholderswhencreatingnewor
improvingexistingservices. Hence,ifthereisa“truenorth”ofservicedesignitis

Furthermore,servicedesignerswanttounderstandcustomersorotherstakeholders
