## Bug Report
### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
master `6cf1f1e`
### Which project did you use? ShardingSphere-JDBC or ShardingSphere-Proxy?
ShardingSphere-Proxy
### Expected behavior
`CREATE READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE` failed.
### Actual behavior
Got an exception but `CREATE READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE` success.
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule
configuration, when exception occur etc.
  1. Create `ms_group_0`, use `resource_0`
    CREATE READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE ms_group_0 (
    WRITE_RESOURCE=resource_0,
    READ_RESOURCES(resource_1),TYPE(NAME=random)
    );
  2. Create `ms_group_1`, use `resource_0` too
    CREATE READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE ms_group_1` (
    WRITE_RESOURCE=resource_0,
    READ_RESOURCES(resource_1),TYPE(NAME=random)
    );
### log
    ERROR 1999 (42000): Unknown exception: Can not config duplicate write data source `resource_0` in database `test1`.
But when I execute `show readwrite_splitting rules`, `ms_group_1` exists.
