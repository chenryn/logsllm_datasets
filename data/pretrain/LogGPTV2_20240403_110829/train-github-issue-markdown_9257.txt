## 📝 Provide a description of the new feature
## Every now and then, I want to use normal half-width Aero snap for one of my
windows when the rest of them are in FancyZones zones and _I know_ I can just
drag as usual, but because I use Fancy Zones so much, I find I've gone and
pressed the Shift modifier by accident! can anyone think of a good way of
having a special drop zone where it would end up as normal Aero snap without
that being confusing when you really did want the FancyZone zone? It's just
I've done it three times today (I clearly need more coffee!)
