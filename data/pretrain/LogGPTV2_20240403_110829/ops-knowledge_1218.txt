I'm running a Python-based automation solution on a Linux system. As part of the test, I am calling different REST APIs and connecting to a MySQL database. The solution runs 24/7 and performs the following tasks:

1. Calls an API using `wget`.
2. Samples the database every minute for up to 60 minutes.
3. Calls the API again using `wget`.
4. Samples the database every minute for up to 10 minutes.

This scenario runs continuously. However, after 1-2 hours (the timing is inconsistent; it can happen after 45 minutes, for example), the solution exits with the error: "Temporary failure in name resolution."

This issue can occur even after two successful cycles as described above. After the failure, I attempt to call the API using `wget` multiple times, but I continue to receive the same error. Eventually, the issue resolves itself without any intervention.

It's worth noting that when the `wget` command fails on Linux, I am still able to call the API successfully using Postman on a Windows machine. The API calls are made to our system, which is hosted on AWS, and I am using the DNS of our Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

What could be causing this inconsistency?

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **DNS Resolution Issues:**
   - **Cause:** The DNS server might be temporarily unavailable or experiencing high latency.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that your DNS server is reliable. You can try using a different DNS server, such as Google's public DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare's DNS (1.1.1.1).
   - **Configuration:** Update your `/etc/resolv.conf` file to use a more reliable DNS server.

2. **Network Connectivity:**
   - **Cause:** There might be intermittent network issues between your Linux machine and the DNS server or the API endpoint.
   - **Solution:** Check the network connectivity and ensure that there are no firewall rules or network policies blocking the traffic. You can use tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nslookup` to diagnose the network path.

3. **Resource Constraints:**
   - **Cause:** Your Linux machine might be running out of resources (e.g., memory, CPU) due to the continuous execution of the script.
   - **Solution:** Monitor the resource usage on your Linux machine and ensure that it has enough resources to handle the load. Consider optimizing the script to reduce its resource footprint or adding more resources if necessary.

4. **API Rate Limiting:**
   - **Cause:** The API might have rate limiting in place, which could cause temporary failures if you exceed the allowed number of requests.
   - **Solution:** Check the API documentation for rate limits and ensure that your script respects these limits. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle rate limiting gracefully.

5. **Script Logic:**
   - **Cause:** There might be a bug or a logical issue in the script that causes it to fail under certain conditions.
   - **Solution:** Review the script for any potential issues, such as incorrect handling of exceptions or race conditions. Add logging to capture more detailed information about the failure.

6. **System Logs:**
   - **Cause:** The system logs might provide more insight into the root cause of the issue.
   - **Solution:** Check the system logs (`/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`) and the application logs for any relevant error messages or warnings.

By addressing these potential causes, you should be able to identify and resolve the inconsistency in your solution.
