User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Problem installing ntop on FreeBSD 6.2 I'm following the instructions at http://www.ntop.org/download.html.

At some point during the ./configure phase of the install, I get this error message:

configure: error: Unable to find RRD at /usr/local/rrdtool: please use --with-rrd-home=DIR

I run which rrdtool and I get:

/usr/local/bin/rrdtool


...so I run: ./configure --with-rrd-home=/usr/local/bin/rrdtool

The installation continues, until it fails at the same spot, same error. I've tried a bunch of varying paths, like:

`./configure --with-rrd-home=/usr/local/bin/`
`./configure --with-rrd-home=/usr/local/bin`
`[...]`
`./configure --with-rrd-home=/usr`


... as I read in a suggestion while Googling the problem.

If it matters, I don't have root access on this machine. It's a dedicated server at my web host.

Any suggestions?

Assistant: Even better than all of the previous answers, why are you trying to install this by hand?

The ports tree contains ntop:

http://www.freshports.org/net/ntop/

So if you have the ports tree installed (if not, check the FreeBSD Handbook on using ports)

The ports tree is an amazing feature for FreeBSD in that it does the dependency tracking and compiles said dependencies for you. The version in the ports tree is outdated by 2 versions from what I can see, generally a nice email to the port maintainer can help you solve that issue!

Edit: Re-read your question and it seems that you are not running as root, how are you planning on getting access to a bpf device to log packets?
