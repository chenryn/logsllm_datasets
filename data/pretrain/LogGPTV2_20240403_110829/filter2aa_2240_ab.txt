cept for Apple’s Safari SF3 which surpassed 60% share within
3 months of its release - likely inﬂuenced by Apple’s contro-
versial inclusion of the new Web browser in the auto-updates
of other popular Apple software products [22].
3.3
Browser Insecurity Iceberg
Just as a ﬂoating iceberg only exhibits part of its mass above
the waterline, we believe that our measurement of potentially
insecure Web browsers based upon major and minor version
information is smaller than the global number of users at risk.
Insecure Web browsers (i.e., they have ”built-in” vulnerabili-
ties and security weaknesses) are of course a critical security
problem, but vulnerable plug-ins that are accessible (and ex-
ploitable) through the Web browser extend the insecurity ice-
berg and form the part hidden below the water surface.
3.3.1
Browsers with built-in vulnerabilities
We have estimated the global number of users with browsers
having "built-in" vulnerabilities based upon our measurements
and Secunia’s PSI study.
Secunia [21] identiﬁed (for the month of May 2008) that
4.4% of IE7, 8.1% of Firefox, 14.3% of Safari (Windows only),
and 15.2% of Opera users have not applied the most recent
security patches available to them from the software vendor.
In comparison, we discovered that 16.7% of Firefox, 34.7%
of Safari (all OS), and 43.9% of Opera Web browser installa-
tions (using our Web server log-based measurements) had not
applied the most recent security patches. We found that our
Firefox, Safari, and Opera results were higher than those of
Secunia’s, differing by a factor of 2.1 (Firefox), 2.4 (Safari),
and 2.9 (Opera), and attribute this difference to a probable bias
for more security aware users to take advantage of Secunia’s
security scanner PSI than the average global community.
To derive the global population of users with browsers vul-
nerable to built-in vulnerabilities we used the results of our
measurements for Firefox, Safari, and Opera. We chose to es-
timate the value for IE7 based upon the ﬁndings of Secunia as
shown in Table 3:
• Estimate A
Firefox, Safari, and Opera shares are from our Google
Web log measurements. The IE7 share of 4.4% is from
Secunia’s measurement [21]. This is a minimum esti-
mate as Secunia’s measurement is likely biased towards
more security aware users. IE6 is not considered a most
secure Web browser version (independent of patch level)
as per Microsoft’s upgrade recommendation in [19].

Table 3: Estimation of the number of users not using the most secure version of their browser.
We apply the factor 2.1 to the IE7 share (2.1 x 4.4% =
9.2%) to correct for the bias of Secunia’s measurement
within a security aware user population. The factor was
found when comparing Firefox, Safari, and Opera data
from Google log ﬁles with Secunia’s data.
Our estimate B shows that at least 45.2%, or 637 million
users, were not using the most secure Web browser version
on any working day from January 2007 to June 2008. These
browsers are an easy target for drive-by download attacks as
they are potentially vulnerable to known exploits. This repre-
sents the tip of the Browser Insecurity Iceberg in Figure 1.
Browsers with plug-in vulnerabilities
Because our data sources were limited to the data logged by
Google’s Web servers and the USER-AGENT ﬁelds for major
and minor Web browser version information, and as plug-in
version information is not typically stored in this data ﬁeld, we
were not able to directly measure the number of users having
out of date and vulnerable Web browser plug-ins. However,
there is public evidence that this number adds to the number
of users with browsers having "built-in" vulnerabilities:
• Fully patched browsers at risk Through vulnerable
plug-ins even those hosts are at risk, which are running
the latest most secure browser version.
• Cross-browser and cross-platform plug-ins Most plug-
ins are compatible with multiple popular Web browser
technologies and operating systems. Therefore a larger
population of users are exposed if a common plug-in is
found to be vulnerable.
• Multiple popular plug-ins per browser A typical Web
browser has more than one plug-in application installed.
Media players and other plug-ins are ubiquitous, with
individual usage shares frequently exceeding 80% [2].
Table 3 lists the adopted use of some of the most popular
plug-in applications - all of which are accessible through
a Web browser.
• Plug-in patching discipline Considering our analysis
of insecure Web browser usage, we deem it unlikely that
the same users achieve higher patch levels for multiple
plug-ins installed; with each plug-in relying on different
patching and updating mechanisms. For example, Se-
cunia’s numbers that state 18.7% of all WinAMP 5 in-
stallations miss important security updates, and 21.7%
of all Quicktime 7 installations are out of date [17].
Users with browsers having plug-in vulnerabilities and those
found to have browsers with built-in vulnerabilities are not
mutually exclusive. While we can estimate the tip of the Browser
Insecurity Iceberg based on global measurements, additional
users at risk are hidden below the water line as shown in Fig-
ure 1.

TOWARDS A SAFER BROWSING EX-
PERIENCE
4.1
Existing Technology Solutions
There exist today a number of technologies that have already
been proven to offer some degree of protection against threats
that target insecure and vulnerable Web browsers. While none
of these technologies are currently capable of providing full
protection against the threats, wherever possible, we recom-
mend that enterprises and vendors deploy or implement them
as part of their defence in depth strategy to help reduce the
surface area of potential attacks.
4.1.1
Auto-update
Although Web browser users wish perfect software that will
never have any exploitable software vulnerabilities, the near-
est they can realistically hope for is that any vulnerabilities are
promptly ﬁxed by the software vendors and instantly applied
to their browser. Critical to this instantaneous patching process
is the mechanism of ”auto-update”. Our measurement con-
ﬁrmed that Web browsers which implement an internal auto-
update patching mechanism do much better in terms of faster
update adoption rates than those without.
Our comparison of the update dynamics between Firefox
and Opera identiﬁed that auto-update mechanisms are crucial
for timely patching. Firefox’s auto-update was found to be
way more effective than Opera’s manual update download re-
minder strategy.
In our measurement period from January 2007 to June 2008,
most users updated to a new version of Firefox within three
days of a new public release, resulting in up to 83% of users

having the most current and secure Firefox version installed.
It took users of the Opera Web browser an average of 11 days
before reaching an update saturation at a level of up to 56%
of the users running the most current and secure Opera ver-
sion. While Firefox and Opera check for updates when the
browser is used, Safari relies on an external Apple-updater
that appears to only poll for new updates at scheduled regu-
lar intervals while Internet Explorer gets updated as part of the
monthly distributed Windows patches.
Regarding speed for upgrading to the next major browser
version, Firefox, Safari and Opera users clearly outperformed
Internet Explorer users (see Figure 2). Considering that Mi-
crosoft offers Internet Explorer 7 as an auto-upgrade from In-
ternet Explorer 6 as part of the monthly Windows updates and
that it requires a manual patch to prevent upgrading to version
7, it is rather surprising to see how slow the migration to the
most secure version has been.
We believe the auto-update mechanism as implemented within
Firefox to be the most efﬁcient patching mechanism of the
Web browsers studied. Firefox’s mechanism regularly polls
an online authority to verify whether a new version of the Web
browser is available and typically prompts the user to update
if a new version exists. With a single click (assuming that
the user has administrative rights on the host), the update is
downloaded and installed. Just as importantly, Firefox also
checks for many of the currently installed Firefox plug-ins if
they are similarly up to date, and, if not, will prompt the user
to update them. Opera’s update mechanism is essentially the
same procedure as a manual download and re-installation of
the browser.
While Microsoft’s operating system auto-update functional-
ity encompasses the Internet Explorer update mechanism even
if the browser is not in use, the fact that patch updates (for
both Internet Explorer 6 and 7) are typically only made avail-
able on a monthly basis means that updates are released less
frequently (when compared to Firefox), which can result in a
lower short term patching effectiveness.
Based upon our ﬁndings, we strongly recommend that soft-
ware vendors embrace auto-update mechanisms within their
products that are capable of identifying the availability of new
patches and installing security updates as quickly and efﬁ-
ciently as possible - ideally enabled by default and causing
minimal disruption to the user. We also recommend that these
same auto-update mechanisms are capable of alerting the user
of any plug-ins currently exposed through the Web browser
that have newer and more secure versions available.
4.1.2
Perimeter URL Filtering
In light of mass-defacements and the organised ”seeding” of
Web sites for the purpose of drive-by download attacks, cur-
rent URL ﬁltering technologies can help to mitigate a fraction
of the threat. When URL ﬁltering technologies are deployed at
the perimeter of a businesses network, and all corporate users
proxy their Internet page requests through it, vulnerable hosts
can usually be protected from Web sites known to be host-
ing malicious content designed to compromise vulnerable Web
browsers.
If a Web site or particular URL is known to be malicious,
it is a trivial process to prevent Web browser users navigating
to the site and accessing the malicious content. However, a
limitation of this protection is the extent of the URL database.
If a malicious URL is not listed within the ﬁltering database,
no ﬁltering protection is typically applied.
Major vendors that offer URL ﬁltering solutions tend to have
extensive coverage of well known and previously identiﬁed
malicious Web sites, and are quick to incorporate new URL
ﬁlters once additional malicious Web sites are reported. As
such, URL ﬁltering technologies have proven to perform well
against most current-generation mass-defacement iframe in-
festations, largely due to the fact that the iframes injected into
vulnerable Web sites during the mass-defacements tend to point
to only a limited set of URL’s that host the malicious infection
code. However, there is an expectation that the criminals be-
hind these attacks will soon adopt new techniques designed to
bypass less agile URL ﬁltering technologies.
We believe that URL ﬁltering technologies are a valuable
protection for reducing vulnerable Web browser exploitation.
Given the success of this class of protection technology in
helping to mitigate the drive-by download threat, we encour-
age its use beyond just protecting corporate environments. Some
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) already offer URL ﬁltering
services to their customers and several popular search engine
providers have also begun to issue visible alerts to users for
URLs known to be malicious or fraudulent. We encourage
vendors to collaborate and share information on newly identi-
ﬁed malicious URLs (in the same vein as the malware research
community already shares malware and analysis results) so
that the most current and exhaustive ﬁltering lists are available
for the protection of all.
