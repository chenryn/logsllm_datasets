(cid:175)(cid:175)(cid:175) = 0.
which implies that the product in (24) must equal zero:
(αj − βN−j+1)
(25)
j=1
This means that there exists an index k (1 ≤ k ≤ N ) such
that αk − βN−k+1 = 0, which contradicts the assumption
that intervals [αN , α1] and [βN , β1] are disjoint.
Repeating steps 1) and 2) for all roots {zi} of (22), we
obtain that they all must lie within the unit circle, which
leads to the asymptotic stability of LD in (16).
Since L is a special case of LD (i.e., all delays are 1 time
unit), stability of the latter implies that of the former and
leads to the necessary condition of the theorem.
Theorem 1 opens an avenue for inferring stability of de-
layed linear systems based on the coeﬃcient matrices of the
corresponding undelayed systems. Moreover, it is easy to
see that Theorem 1 applies to nonlinear systems as stated
in the following corollary.
Corollary 1. Assume an undelayed N -dimensional non-
linear system N :
xi(n) = fi
x1(n − 1), x2(n − 1),··· , xN (n − 1)
(26)
where {fi|fi : RN → R} is the set of nonlinear functions
deﬁning the system. If the Jacobian matrix J of this sys-
tem is symmetric and real-valued, system ND with arbitrary
delay:

is locally asymptotically stable in the stationary point x∗ if
and only if N is stable in x∗.
where fi(x) = (1 − βp(x))xi + α. Since packet loss depends
on the aggregate rate of all users, p(n) has the same ﬁrst
partial derivative evaluated in the ﬁxed point for all users,
which implies that for any users i and k, we have:

Clearly Jacobian matrix J is circulant2 and thus its k-th
eigenvalue λk is given by [1]:
k + ··· + ζ N−1
k + ζ 3
λk = a + b(ζk + ζ 2
(39)
where ζk = ei2πk/N (k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1) is one of the N -th
roots of unity. We only consider the case of N ≥ 2, otherwise
the only eigenvalue is simply a. Then, it is not diﬃcult to
get the following result:

Based on the above principles, we next prove local stabil-
ity of MKC under heterogeneous feedback delays.
4.3 Stability of MKC
We ﬁrst consider an MKC system with a generic feedback
function ηi(n) in the form of (13), which we assume is diﬀer-
entiable in the stationary point and has the same ﬁrst-order
partial derivative for all end-users. Our goal is to derive suf-
ﬁcient and necessary conditions for the stability of (12)-(13)
under arbitrarily delayed feedback.
We approach this problem by partitioning all users into
non-overlapping sets based on their corresponding bottle-
neck routers. We assume that each set of users S is fairly sta-
ble and that the bottlenecks do not change for the duration
of this analysis. Suppose that S contains users {x1, . . . , xN}
and that the corresponding delays to/from their bottleneck
router are given by D→
. Then, we can simplify
(12)-(13) by dropping index j of the bottleneck resource and
expanding ηi(n) in (12):
and D←

xi(n) = xi(n − Di) + α − βp(n − D

where
p(n) = p
(cid:179) N(cid:88)
u=1
(cid:180)
xu(n − D
→

(29)
is the packet-loss function of the bottleneck router for set
S. Notice that xi(n − Di) in (28) can be represented as
xi(n−D→
i ) and that controller (28)-(29) has the same
shape as that in (27).
i −D←
To invoke Theorem 1, our ﬁrst step is to show stability of
the following undelayed version of (28)-(29):
(cid:40)
(cid:161)
(cid:162)
(cid:180)
(cid:179)(cid:80)N
1 − βp(n − 1)
u=1 xu(n)
xi(n) =
p(n) = p
xi(n − 1) + α
Theorem 3. Undelayed N -dimensional system (30) with
feedback p(n) that is common to all users has a symmetric
Jacobian and is locally asymptotically stable if and only if:
∗
∗
0 < βp
0 < βp

∗ ∂p

(cid:175)(cid:175)(cid:175)(cid:175)

(31)
(32)
where x∗ is the ﬁxed point of each individual user, vector
x∗ = (cid:104)x∗, x∗,··· , x∗(cid:105) is the ﬁxed point of the entire system,
and p∗ is the steady-state packet loss.
Proof. We ﬁrst derive the stationary point x∗ of each in-
dividual user. Since all end-users receive the same feedback
and activate the same response to it, all ﬂows share the bot-
tleneck resource fairly in the steady state, i.e., xi(n) = x∗
for all i. Using simple manipulations in (30), we get the
stationary individual rate x∗ as following:

(30)
where the last transition holds since ζ N
k = 1 for all k.
Next, recall that nonlinear system (30) is locally stable
if and only if all eigenvalues of its Jacobian matrix J are
within the unit circle [12]. Therefore, we get the following
necessary and suﬃcient local stability conditions:
(cid:40)
|a − b| < 1
|a + (N − 1)b| < 1
.
(41)
To ensure that each λi lies in the unit circle, we examine
the two conditions in (41) separately. First, notice that |a−
b| = |1 − βp∗|, which immediately leads to the following:
0 < βp
∗
< 2.
(42)
Applying the same substitution to the second inequality in
(41), we obtain:
∗
0 < βp
+ βN x
∗ ∂p
∂xi
< 2.
x∗
(43)
Thus, system (30) is locally stable if and only if both (42)
and (43) are satisﬁed.
According to the proof of Theorem 3, Jacobian J of the
undelayed system (30) is real-valued and symmetric. Com-
bining this property with Corollary 1, we obtain the follow-
ing result.
2A matrix is called circulant if it is square and each of its
rows can be obtained by shifting (with wrap-around) the
previous row one column right [1].
(cid:175)(cid:175)(cid:175)(cid:175)
Corollary 2. Heterogeneously delayed MKC (28)–(29)
is locally asymptotically stable if and only if (31)-(32) are
satisﬁed.
Corollary 2 is a generic result that is applicable to MKC
(12) with a wide class of congestion-indicator functions ηi(n).
Further note that for a given bottleneck resource with pric-
ing function p(n) and its set of users S, conditions (31)-(32)
are easy to verify and do not depend on feedback delays,
the number of hops in each path, or the routing matrix of
all users. This is in contrast to many current studies [9],
[24], [26], [27], whose results are dependent on individual
feedback delays Di and the topology of the network.
4.4 Exponential MKC
To understand the practical implications of the deriva-
tions above, consider a particular packet-loss function p(n)
in (29):
(cid:80)N
(cid:80)N
u=1 xu(n − D→
u=1 xu(n − D→
u )
u ) − C
,
p(n) =
(44)
where we again assume a set S of N users congested by a
common router of capacity C. This is a rather standard
packet-loss function with the exception that we allow it to
become negative when the link is under-utilized. As we show
in the next section, (44) achieves exponential convergence
to eﬃciency, which explains why we call the combination of
(28),(44) Exponential MKC (EMKC).
Theorem 4. Heterogeneously delayed EMKC (28),(44) is
locally asymptotically stable if and only if 0 < β < 2.
Proof. We ﬁrst derive the ﬁxed point of EMKC. Notice
that in the proof of Theorem 3, we established the existence
of a unique stationary point x∗
i = x∗ for each ﬂow. Then
assuming EMKC packet-loss function (44), we have:
N x∗ − C
∗

(45)
Combining (45) and (33), we get the stationary point x∗ of
each end-user:
