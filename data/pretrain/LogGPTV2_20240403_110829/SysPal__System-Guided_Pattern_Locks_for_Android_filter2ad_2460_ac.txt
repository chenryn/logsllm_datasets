### Authentication Time Analysis

In the first test, all SysPal policies (4.17–4.47 seconds) and the Original policy (4.60 seconds) significantly outperformed the Random policy (12.90 seconds) with statistical significance (all p < 0.001, corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test). There was no statistically significant difference in authentication time between the SysPal policies and the Original policy (p = 1.0, p = 0.74, p = 1.0 for 1-Point, 2-Point, and 3-Point, respectively, corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test).

In the second test, the authentication times for the SysPal policies and the Original policy remained similar (p = 0.76, p = 1.0, p = 1.0 for 1-Point, 2-Point, and 3-Point, respectively, corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test), but the mean authentication time for the Random policy decreased. In the third test, the mean authentication time for all policies increased, which is expected since the third test was conducted at least 24 hours after the second test. Despite this, all SysPal policies (5.79–6.53 seconds) and the Original policy (6.31 seconds) still outperformed the Random policy (12.77 seconds) with statistical significance (all p < 0.001, corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test).

### Mean Number of Authentication Attempts

Table VI shows the mean number of attempts made to complete the authentication process across the three recall success rate tests. The number of attempts by those who failed the tests (i.e., 5 attempts) was included in the average.

- **First Test**: The mean number of attempts for all SysPal policies (1.12–1.19) and the Original policy (1.14) were significantly lower than that of the Random policy (2.26) (all p < 0.001, corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test). This indicates that participants using the Random policy had to draw their pattern twice on average to unlock their device, highlighting a significant usability issue.
- **Second Test**: The mean number of attempts for all policies slightly decreased.
- **Third Test**: The mean number of attempts increased again.

### Pattern Setup Time

We also measured the time taken to set up a pattern, from the initial pattern selection screen to the final selection, including the time spent on initializing the grid.

- **Setup Time**: As shown in Table VII, the mean setup time was similar across all policies except for the Random policy, which had the longest mean setup time of 36.9 seconds (all p < 0.001, corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test). There was no statistically significant difference between the Original and all SysPal policies (all p = 1.0, corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test).
- **Initialization**: Participants were allowed to initialize (reset) the grid unlimited times. The Original and SysPal participants initialized the grid 0.07 to 0.08 times on average, while the Random participants initialized the grid 0.12 times on average (all p < 0.001, corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test).

### Recall Difficulty

Figure 3 presents the results for the third-test recall difficulty. The majority of the SysPal and Original participants found their patterns easy to remember, with a median value of "5" ("very easy"). In contrast, more Random participants found their patterns difficult to remember, with a median value of "4" ("easy"). The Original and all SysPal policies demonstrated statistically significant superiority in self-reported recall difficulty over the Random policy (all p < 0.001, unpaired corrected MW U test).

### Remembrance Techniques

Participants were asked if they used any special techniques to create and remember their patterns. Approximately 22.48% of participants used a technique, with 69.34% forming a shape, and about half of those using a letter (e.g., 'Z' or 'S') as a shape. Some participants created a number sequence (like PINs) and remembered it, while others practiced several times or created a pattern starting from the top left and ending at the bottom right.

### 15-Minute Wait Period

After the first recall success rate test, participants were asked to wait for 15 minutes before continuing with the second test. During this period, most participants surfed the Internet (36.99%) or watched TV (15.93%). Interestingly, 12.50% participated in another survey on MTurk, and a few checked emails, read books, cooked, or ate, totaling 16.75%.

### Security Results

Based on participants' responses, we estimated the pattern "recall difficulty" across different policies. The security results for the three SysPal policies, compared to the Original and Random policies, are presented in the following section.

### Point Usage Ratios

Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the usage ratios for each of the 9 points, the ratio of each point being used as the starting point, and the frequency of each point being used as the ending point, respectively. These figures provide insights into the distribution of point usage across different policies.
