Assistant: This log chunk is related to various software components running on the system. It begins with locationd making a network request and loginwindow notifying of item changes. QQ is deallocated and ksfetch is fetching a URL. GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent has no updates to apply and WindowServer is preparing for a power off. The kernel is sending a message type and QQ is sending a button report. com.apple.cts is ignoring a job and ChromeExistion is running various commands. Locationd is changing an icon state and sharingd is purging contact hashes. The kernel is setting an AWDL operation mode and networkd is using a process name as a bundle ID.
