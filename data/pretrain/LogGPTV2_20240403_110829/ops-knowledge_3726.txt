User: Specify a certain folder, write a Python script, pack all the text files in the folder into a zip file and add a time stamp.
Assistant: The following is a Python script to achieve this function: ```python import os import zipfile import time def zip_dir(path): # Get the current date and time date_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H-% M-%S") # The zip file name is the current date and time plus the .zip suffix zip_name = date_time + ".zip" # Open the zip file zipf = zipfile.ZipFile(zip_name, "w", zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) # Traverse the file Folder all files for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path): for file in files: # Only process text files if file.endswith(".txt"): # Get the absolute path of the text file file_path = os. path.join(root, file) # Add the text file to the zip file zipf.write(file_path) # Close the zip file zipf.close() if __name__ == "__main__": # Specify the folder to be packaged into a zip file Path path = "folder_path" zip_dir(path) ``` This script will traverse all files in the specified folder, only process text files with extension `.txt`, and add them to a new zip file. The name of the zip file is the current date and time plus the suffix .zip, for example: 2020-10-20-10-30-45.zip. Finally, the zip file is stored in the same folder as the Python script.
