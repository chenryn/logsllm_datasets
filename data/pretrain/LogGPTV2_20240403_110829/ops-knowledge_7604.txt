User: Is there any difference between:
__file__
and 
sys.argv[0]
Because both seem to be doing the same thing: they hold the name of the script.
If there is no difference, then why is it that __file__ is used in almost all someplaces whereas I have never seen sys.argv[0] being used.
Assistant: __file__ is the name of the current file, which may be different from the main script if you are inside a module or if you start a script using execfile() rather than by invoking python scriptname.py.  __file__  is generally your safer bet.
