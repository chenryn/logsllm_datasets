### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:07:34 to 18:07:40 on October 18, highlights several recurring issues within a Hadoop environment:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process is consistently failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. The failure duration increases from 156 seconds to 161 seconds over the time period.
   - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly.

2. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process is unable to contact the Resource Manager (RM) server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The system is retrying the connection with a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep`, which allows up to 10 retries with a 1-second sleep interval between each attempt.

3. **Address Changes**:
   - Both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect address changes. Specifically, the IP address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170` is being updated to `msra-sa-41` for both port 8030 and 9000.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Lease Renewal Failures**:
  - At 18:07:34, the `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 156 seconds.
  - This failure continues, increasing by one second each minute, up to 161 seconds at 18:07:39.

- **RM Communication Issues**:
  - At 18:07:36, 18:07:38, and 18:07:40, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` fails to contact the RM server and logs an error.
  - The system retries the connection immediately after each failure, as indicated by the `INFO` messages.

- **Address Changes**:
  - Multiple `WARN` messages from 18:07:35 to 18:07:39 indicate that the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect address changes from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170` to `msra-sa-41`.

### Conclusion

The log indicates persistent issues with lease renewal and RM communication, along with detected address changes. These issues suggest potential network or configuration problems that need to be addressed to ensure the stability and reliability of the Hadoop cluster.
