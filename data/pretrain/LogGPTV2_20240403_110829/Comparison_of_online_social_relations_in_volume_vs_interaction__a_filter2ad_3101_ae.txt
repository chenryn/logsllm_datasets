evening hours.
In summary, the distribution of inter-message times has three dis-
tinctive regions: for the short time range, the inter-message time is
inhumanly short, explaining the presence of spam and their esti-
mated portion. Yet the distribution agrees with other known task
distributions (e.g. MSN messengers). For inter-message times
longer than 36 min and shorter than 1 day, the behavior closely
matches that of email transmissions, but at a lower rate. Beyond
1 day, we detect daily synchronization of activity, but otherwise a
fast decaying distribution.
6. RELATED WORK
Social network analysis has been mostly an area for sociologists
and anthropologists [43]. As electronically compiled social net-
work data has enabled researchers to gain access to large-scale
statistics of networks, it has opened up new possibilities to re-
searchers in other ﬁelds, such as physics and computer science.
Before the emergence of large-scale online social network servic-
ing portals, a variety of other online social networks have been an-
alyzed. Email networks are one of the most studied such networks
[14,25,41,42]. Valverde and Solé study the social network of open
source communities [41, 42]. The massive data of mobile commu-
nication has recently been analyzed [34, 35]. Using mobile phone
records of millions of people, they examine the communication pat-
tern of people. They argue that the stability of the communication
network largely depends on the weak ties in the network.
Holme et al. analyze an online dating community in detail [23].
In their work, the time evolution of activity shows the saturation of
degree and power-law activity pattern. Mislove et al. investigate
not only online SNS, but also other web services that have social
networking features [30]. Java et al. conducted a research on mi-
croblogs [24]. In their work, the in-degree and out-degree distribu-
tion of the network, and the activity pattern of users were analyzed.
Leskovec et al. analyzed the largest social network (instant mes-
saging network) ever published [27]. They analyzed various as-
pects such as the number of buddies, the duration of conversations,
the time interval between each conversation, geographic usage pat-
terns.
Adamic et al. conduct the motif analysis of Yahoo! Answers [1].
They report that the feed-forward loop [36] (motif 7 in Figure 13)
is abundant in ‘Programming’ topic. This abundance of the feed-
forward loop is argued as a unique characteristic of knowledge
communities because experts help those who have lower-level ex-
pertise. Also, Milo et al. shows that transitive interactions and
transitive triads are more abundant than intransitive ones [28].
The friendship in online is different from that in ofﬂine. Cum-
mings et al. compares the quality of means of social interactions [10].
They show that online relationships are not considered valuable
as much as ofﬂine ones.
It is concurrent to our knowledge that
the online relationship seems to be more shallow and easy to be
formed [2].
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this work we have investigated the guestbook logs of Cyworld,
the biggest OSNS in Korea. We construct a weighted and directed
activity network based on the comments users wrote in other guest-
books. The Cyworld activity network witnessed explosive growth
in 2004, and our data spans from July 2003 to October 2005, cover-
ing the peak growth period. Two limitations of the present data set
come from self-posts and likely spams. The activity network con-
tains self-loops that map to self-posts. Self-posts are likely to be an-
swers to previous posts, but we could not disambiguate self-posts
according to the intended receiver. Although banned, automated
scripts have been in use in Cyworld and our guestbook logs contain
comments generated by such scripts. We suspect most automatic-
script-generated comments are spam, but have no means to validate
this.
We have analyzed the structural characteristics of the activity
network and compared them with the friends network. Although
the activity network is weighted and directed, its structure is simi-
lar to the friend relationship network. The in-degree and out-degree
distributions are close to each other and social interaction through
the guestbook is highly reciprocated. When we consider only those
links in the activity network that are reciprocated, the degree cor-
relation distribution exhibits much more pronounced assortativity
than the friends network and places it close to known social net-
works. The k-core analysis gives further corroborating evidence
that the friends network deviates from the known social network
and has an unusually large number of highly connected cores.
Thanks to its weighted and directed nature, the activity network
lends insight into the actual dynamics of interaction between users
of an OSNS. In our analysis, we have seen that a user is recipro-
cated for his or her activity in terms of the total number of mes-
sages, and unequivocal reciprocity holds between most pairs of
users. However, the analysis of disparity shows that users who have
roughly two hundred friends or less tend to communicate unevenly,
while those users with very large numbers of friends interact more
evenly. The network motif analysis of the activity network demon-
strates that online interaction through the Cyworld guestbook fea-
ture follows trends of other social networks [29] closely. However,
massive one-way communication suspected to be from spammers
and celebrities distorts the Z-scores for motifs 1 and 2. In spite of
explosive growth during the period of interest, the Z-score distri-
butions of the network motifs consistently show high proximity to
those from previously analyzed social networks.
We report an interesting observation that the activity measured
by the node strength increases linearly with the number of friends,
but starts to fall off beyond 200. This number is larger than what
we anticipated through Dunbar’s number, and requires further in-
vestigation. We have found that the distribution of inter-message
time intervals has three different regions, but for a comprehensive
understanding of this tri-modal behavior has yet to be reached. This
is yet another point for more work.
Online social networks are spreading very rapidly and affect many
corners of our daily web experience. The present work offers in-
sight into the macroscopic behavior of an online social network.
We plan to extend this work to include an analysis of group dy-
namics and microscopic analyses from the perspecitves of individ-
ual users. We hope this work offers insight into information ﬂow in
cyber space.
