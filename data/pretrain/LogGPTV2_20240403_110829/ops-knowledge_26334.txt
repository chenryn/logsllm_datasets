User: I'm using PyBluez on Ubuntu 10.10. I would like to know how is possible to change the bluetooth name of the local device in software. I couldn't find any command related..
Assistant: Invoke org.bluez.Adapter.SetProperty(u'Name', u'New name here') in the /org/bluez/<pid>/<device> object path on the org.bluez D-Bus bus.
