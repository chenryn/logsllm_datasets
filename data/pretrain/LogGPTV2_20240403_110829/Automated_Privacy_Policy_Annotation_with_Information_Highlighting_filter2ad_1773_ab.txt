### Data Preprocessing and Feature Representation

In the preprocessing phase, common words that do not contribute to the meaning are removed. Subsequently, the WordNet Lemmatizer is employed for lemmatization and stemming. This process eliminates generic and non-essential terms, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the learning process.

#### Paragraph Representation
To derive a highly discriminative representation for each category, various text representation techniques are utilized in TLDR, including word mapping, count vectorizer, TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and WordPiece. Effective preprocessing and feature representation are crucial for uncovering hidden patterns within paragraphs without the need for manual annotation.

### Learning Algorithms
TLDR employs an ensemble of learning algorithms to associate paragraphs with their corresponding privacy policy categories, thereby revealing the abstract content of the policies. The algorithms used include Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). These algorithms are evaluated for their effectiveness in detecting various paragraph-level categories.

Given the uniqueness of privacy policy categories, TLDR leverages the most effective data representation for category classification. The diversity of explored representations and learning algorithms is essential due to the varied nature of the categories, as treating them uniformly can lead to reduced performance.

### Evaluation and Discussion
#### 3.1 Annotation Results of TLDR
**Experimental Setup:**
We used document-based splitting, where 80% of the documents in the OPP-115 dataset were used for training the ensemble, and the remaining 20% for validation. For deep learning architectures, we adopted the CNN model architecture by Harkous et al. [5] and replaced the convolutional layers with fully connected layers to build the DNN model. The BERT model was configured with a maximum of 512 words, and the number of features ranged from 1,000 to 5,000, with increments of 1,000.

**Annotation Results:**
Table 1 presents the best-performing architecture for each category. We also report the best evaluation results from Wilson et al. [9], Harkous et al. [5], and Liu et al. [6] on the OPP-115 dataset using the F1 score. As shown, TLDR outperforms its counterparts by a large margin, particularly for the "Data Retention" category, except for "Specific Audiences" and "Do Not Track" categories.

#### 3.2 Alexa Top-10,000 Websites Analysis
We applied TLDR to analyze the privacy policies of the top-10,000 websites listed by Alexa, which represent the most visited sites globally. This analysis reveals common practices among popular websites and their service providers, targeting a significant portion of internet users.

**Privacy Policy Extraction:**
Using Selenium [8], we crawled and extracted privacy policies from the Alexa top-10,000 websites between November 4 and November 8, 2020. Terms such as "privacy policy" and "privacy" were searched to locate the policies. We successfully extracted policies from 5,598 websites, while the remaining sites were either non-English or did not directly link to their privacy policies. To validate the extraction process, we manually inspected 1,000 policies and verified that 95.8% were correctly extracted.

**Data Preprocessing & Representation:**
The extracted paragraphs (345,920) were preprocessed and represented similarly to the OPP-115 dataset [9]. Stop-words were removed, and the words were lemmatized and stemmed. Hyperparameter configurations were limited to the best-performing settings within the feature representations and learning algorithms.

**Evaluation & Discussion:**
Figure 3 shows the percentage of websites containing information related to the policy categories for both OPP-115 and Alexa top-10,000 websites. "First-party use" and "third party sharing" are the most common categories, with 95% and 90% of the websites, respectively, containing relevant information. In contrast, the "do not track" category is the least common, with only 20% of the websites reporting associated information. Given the ensemble's F1 score of 100% for this category, the results are highly reliable.

**Missing Information:**
Our analysis revealed that many privacy policies lack key information, such as data security and user tracking. This is surprising, given that these policies are from the top-visited websites, which are subject to significant scrutiny.

**Future Direction: Per Topic Analysis:**
To better understand the disclosed privacy practices, we plan to conduct a per-topic analysis using Webshrinker [4], a machine learning-powered domain data and threat classifier. This will help in drawing deeper observations about trends among the most popular websites.

#### 3.3 User Study: Information Highlighting
We conducted a user study with 20 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of TLDR in information highlighting. Reducing unnecessary policy information makes it easier to understand privacy practices, but omitting important aspects can reduce user awareness.

**Methodology:**
Each participant was assigned three policies of different lengths. Two instances of each policy were provided: the original and the TLDR-filtered version. Participants read the two versions in random order, unaware of the filtering process. They recorded the reading time for each policy and completed a survey after each reading.

**Results:**
82% of participants found the TLDR-filtered policies understandable and suitable, compared to 69% for the original policies. This may be due to the removal of unnecessary legal information. Participants also reported a 39.14% reduction in reading time for TLDR-filtered policies. However, 23% of the policies contained critical information not included in the TLDR-filtered version.

### Concluding Remarks
In this work, we revisited the automated privacy policy annotation problem by exploring and improving the accuracy through various learning and representation techniques. TLDR, our proposed pipeline, uses deep representation techniques and an ensemble of machine and deep learning models to categorize each paragraph in privacy policies, achieving an average F1 score of 91%. Our user study demonstrated the effectiveness of TLDR in highlighting privacy practices, reducing reading time, and increasing understandability.
