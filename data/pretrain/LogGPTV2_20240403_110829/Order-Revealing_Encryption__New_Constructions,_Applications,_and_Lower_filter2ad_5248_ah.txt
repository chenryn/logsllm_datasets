then the simulator chooses ¯ρ
Correctness of the simulation. To conclude the proof, we now show that the real and ideal
experiments REALoreA (λ) and SIMoreA,S,Lcmp(λ) are computationally indistinguishable. We begin by
deﬁning a series of hybrid experiments:
• Hybrid H0: This is the real experiment REALoreA (λ) (Deﬁnition 2.2).
• Hybrid H1: Same as H0, except the PRF F (k,·) is replaced by a truly random function f
from {0, 1}λ → {0, 1}λ.
• Hybrid H2: Same as H1, except the experiment aborts (with output ⊥1 or ⊥2) if one of the
following events occur:
– The adversary queries H on an input of the form (f (π(m)),·) before it issues an encryption
query for the message m. In this case, the experiment outputs ⊥1.
– The adversary queries H on an input of the form (·, rj) before it makes its jth encryption
query. Here, rj is the randomness the challenger samples when responding to the jth
encryption query. In this case, the experiment outputs ⊥2.
• Hybrid H3: This is the ideal experiment SIMoreA,S,Lcmp(λ). (Deﬁnition 2.2).
We now argue that each consecutive pair of hybrid experiments are computationally indistinguishable.
Lemma A.1. Hybrid H0 and H1 are computationally indistinguishable if F is a secure PRF.
Proof. Follows immediately from PRF security.
Lemma A.2. Hybrids H1 and H2 are statistically indistinguishable if H is modeled as a random
oracle.
Proof. For each of the two abort events in H2, we argue that the probability of the event occurring
is negligible.
• Case 1: The experiment outputs ⊥1. Suppose the adversary has not issued an encryption
query for a message m ∈ [N ]. We argue that in this case, the adversary’s view in the experiment
is independent of f (π(m)). Consider the ciphertext ct(cid:48) = (ct(cid:48)
L, ct(cid:48)
R) the adversary obtains when
it requests an encryption of some message m(cid:48) (cid:54)= m. Then, ct(cid:48)
L = (f (π(m(cid:48))), π(m(cid:48))). Since π
is a permutation, π(m(cid:48)) (cid:54)= π(m). Next, because f is a truly random function, f (π(m(cid:48))) is
independent of f (π(m)). We conclude that the components of ct(cid:48)
L are distributed independently
of f (π(m)).
N ). Since r(cid:48) is sampled uniformly at random from {0, 1}λ, it is
Consider now ct(cid:48)
distributed independently of f (π(m)). Next, for all i ∈ [N ], vi = cmp(π−1(i), m(cid:48)) + H(f (i), r(cid:48)).
R = (r(cid:48), v(cid:48)
1, . . . , v(cid:48)
34
The value of cmp(π−1(i), m(cid:48)) is independent of the function f . Similarly, the output of the
random oracle on (f (i), r(cid:48)) is independent of its input, and thus, independent of f (π(m)).
Thus, the components of ct(cid:48)
R are distributed independently of f (π(m)).
Finally, the responses from the random oracle are distributed independently of f . We thus
conclude that unless the adversary requests for an encryption of m, its view in hybrid H1 is
distributed independently of f (π(m)). Now, let z1, . . . , z(cid:96) for (cid:96) = poly(λ) be the adversary’s
queries to the random oracle before it requests for an encryption of m. By our argument above,
each zi must be chosen independently of f (π(m)). Since f is a truly random function, the
probability that there is some i such that zi = (f (π(m)), y) for any y is at most (cid:96)/2λ = negl(λ).
We conclude that H2 outputs ⊥1 with negligible probability.
• Case 2: The experiment outputs ⊥2. Let z1, . . . , z(cid:96) for (cid:96) = poly(λ) be the random oracle
queries the adversary makes before making its jth encryption query. When responding to
r←− {0, 1}λ. In particular, rj is
the jth encryption query, the challenger in H2 samples rj
independent of z1, . . . , z(cid:96), and so the probability that there is some i such that zi = (x, rj) for
any x is at most (cid:96)/2λ = negl(λ). We conclude that H2 outputs ⊥2 with negligible probability,
and the claim follows.
Lemma A.3. Hybrid H2 and H3 are statistically indistinguishable if H is modeled as a random
oracle.
Proof. Let (ct1, . . . , ctq) be the joint distribution of the ciphertexts output in H2 and let (ct1, . . . , ctq)
be the joint distribution of the ciphertexts output in H3. We show that these two distributions are
statistically indistinguishable, and moreover, that the outputs of the random oracle are properly
simulated in H3. Let m1, . . . , mq be the messages chosen by the adversary in H2 and H3. In the
simulation, the table Tkeys is used to maintain the mapping between keys to the message indices
and the permuted positions of the messages. The proof proceeds via induction on the number of
queries q. In the inductive step, we assume that the following conditions hold for some t < q:
• (ct1, . . . , ctt)
• The outputs of the random oracle prior to the (t + 1)th query are statistically indistinguishable
s≈ (ct1, . . . , ctt).
in H2 and H3.
Consider the base case where t = 0. It suﬃces to argue that all of the random oracle queries are
simulated properly in H3. Suppose the adversary queries the random oracle H on an input (k, r).
Without loss of generality, we can assume that each of the adversary’s queries to the random oracle
is unique (the random oracle responds consistently if an input is queried multiple times). Since the
table Tkeys is initially empty, the simulator in H3 always replies with a uniform random element of
Z3 in this case. In H2, the outputs of the random oracle are distributed uniformly and independently
in Z3, assuming that k (cid:54)= f (i) for any i ∈ [N ] (otherwise, the experiment aborts with output ⊥1).
However, as shown in the proof of Lemma A.2, the probability (taken over the randomness used to
sample f ) that k = f (i) for i ∈ [N ] is negligible, and so we conclude that the outputs of the random
oracle in H2 and H3 are statistically indistinguishable.
For the inductive step, suppose that both conditions outlined above hold for some t < q. We
show that both conditions continue to hold for t + 1. We begin with some notation. For all j ∈ [t],
L = (¯kj, ¯hj),
(cid:1) and similarly, ctj =(cid:0)ct(j)
we write ctj =(cid:0)ct(j)
(cid:1), where ct(j)

R =(cid:0)rj, v(j)
(cid:1), and ct(j)
R =(cid:0)¯rj, ¯v(j)
(cid:1). We now argue that the responses to the
1 , . . . , v(j)

random oracle queries the adversary makes between its tth and (t + 1)th encryption query are
statistically indistinguishable in H2 and H3. Let (k, r) be the adversary’s query to the random oracle.
We consider several possibilities:

• Suppose k = ki and r = rj for some i, j ∈ [t]. If there are multiple indices i where k = ki,
consider the smallest such i. In hybrid H2, we have that H(k, r) satisﬁes the relation
v(j)
hi
= cmp(mi, mj) + H(k, r).
By construction in H3, if k = ¯ki, the simulator must have added the mapping ¯ki (cid:55)→ (i, ¯hi) to
Tkeys in response to the ith encryption query (here, we rely on the fact that i is the smallest
such i such that k = ¯ki). In this case then, the simulator responds with ¯ρ as follows:
By the inductive hypothesis, ct(i)

In H2, there are two possibilities.

experiment aborts (with output ⊥1) because the adversary must not have issued an encryption
query for π−1(j). However, as argued in the proof of Lemma A.2, the probability that k (cid:54)= ki
for all i ∈ [t], but k = f (j) for some j ∈ [N ] is negligible. Thus, with overwhelming probability,
in hybrid H2, k (cid:54)= f (j) for all j ∈ [N ]. Then, the value H(k, r) is distributed uniformly and
independently of all other components of the adversary’s view. Speciﬁcally, because k (cid:54)= ki
for all i ∈ [t], the value H(k, r) is distributed independently of the ciphertexts ct1, . . . , ctt.
Moreover, the outputs of the random oracle are all distributed uniformly and independently,
so we conclude that the distribution of H(k, r) given the adversary’s view in H2 is uniform
over Z3. This is precisely the distribution from which the simulator samples the value of
H(k, r) in H3. We conclude that the random oracle outputs are statistically indistinguishable
in H2 and H3.
• Finally, suppose that k = ki for some i ∈ [t], but r (cid:54)= rj for all j ∈ [t]. Similar to the previous
case, in hybrid H2, the value H(k, r) is distributed uniformly and independently of all other
components of the adversary’s view. Thus, conditioned on the adversary’s view, the value
H(k, r) is uniform over Z3. This is precisely how S samples the random oracle output in H3,
so in this case, the responses in H2 and H3 are identically distributed.
Next, we show that the conditional distribution of ctt+1 given ct1, . . . , ctt is statistically indistinguish-
able from the conditional distribution of ctt+1 given ct1, . . . , ctt. Let mt+1 be the adversary’s (t + 1)th
encryption query. First, we show that the conditional distribution of the left ciphertexts ct(t+1)

• If mt+1 (cid:54)= m(cid:96) for some (cid:96) ∈ [t], then conditioned on the adversary’s view after its ﬁrst t
queries, we argue that ht+1 = π(mt+1) is uniform over the set [N ] \ {h1, . . . , ht}, where by
deﬁnition, hi = π(mi) for all i ∈ [t]. To see this, we ﬁrst note that ct(1)

written entirely as a function that only depends on π(m1), . . . , π(mt). Certainly, the outputs

conditioned on the view of the adversary, the values of the right ciphertexts ct(i)
only depend on π(m1), . . . , π(mt). Since the permutation π is sampled uniformly, we conclude
that given the output of the ﬁrst t encryption queries, the value of π(mt+1) is still distributed
uniformly in [N ] \ {π(m1), . . . , π(mt)}. Similarly, by the same argument as that given in the
proof of Lemma A.2, the value of f (π(mt+1)) is independent of the adversary’s view prior
to its (t + 1)th encryption query. Thus, in H2, given the adversary’s view up to the (t + 1)th

Finally, we show that the conditional distributions of the right ciphertext components ct(t+1)

H2, if the adversary has already queried the random oracle on the input (x, rt+1) for any x ∈ {0, 1}λ,
then the experiment aborts with output ⊥2. Equivalently, if the adversary queries the random oracle
on an input (x, ¯rt+1) in H3, the experiment also aborts (with the same output ⊥2). In H2, each vi is
blinded by the value H(f (i), rt+1), and since the adversary has not queried H(f (i), rt+1) before seeing
