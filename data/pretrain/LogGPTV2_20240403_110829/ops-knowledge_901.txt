User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I replay Apache access logs back at my servers to do real world load testing? I looked at Tools for load-testing HTTP servers? but I couldn't see how to replay my own existing logs in any of those tools. I have a bug that only occurs under certain load operations which my existing JMeter and AB testing stuff can't reproduce.

I want to simply give the tool access_logs and have it play them back, either faster or at the same speed.

Assistant: You can use Jmeter's Access Log Sampler component.

There's a short tutorial on it's use in this PDF.
