User: I have a python script which reads a text file in it's current working directory called "data.txt" then converts the data inside of it into a json format for another separate program to handle.
The problem i'm having is that i'm not sure how to read the .txt file (and write a new one) which is in the same directory as the .app when the python script is all bundled up. The current method i'm using doesn't work because of something to do with it using the fact that it's ran from the terminal instead of executed as a .app?
Any help is appreciated!
Assistant: Use the __file__ variable. This will give you the filename of your module. Using the functions in os.path you can determine the full path of the parent directory of your module.  The os.path module is in the standard python documentation, you should be able to find that.
Then you can combine the module path with your filename to open it, using os.path.join.
