throughput of a particular source destination pair. Points above the 45-degree

opportunistic routing is particularly beneﬁcial to challenged ﬂows.

Figure 8: Spatial Reuse. The ﬁgure shows CDFs of unicast throughput
achieved by MORE, ExOR, and Srcr for ﬂows that traverse 4 hops, where
the last hop can transmit concurrently with the ﬁrst hop. MORE’s median
throughput is 45% higher than ExOR.
the three protocols for this environment. Focusing on paths with
spatial reuse ampliﬁes the gain MORE has over ExOR. The ﬁgure
shows that for 4-hop ﬂows with spatial reuse, MORE achieves a
45% higher median throughput than ExOR.
It is important to note that spatial reuse may occur even for shorter
paths. The capture effect allows multiple transmissions to be cor-
rectly received even when the nodes are within the radio range of
both senders [32]. In particular, less than 7% of the ﬂows in Fig. 6
have a best path of 4 hops or longer. Still MORE does better than
ExOR. This is mainly because of capture. The capture effect, how-
ever, is hard to quantify or measure. Thus, we have focused on
longer paths to show the impact of spatial reuse.

Figure 10: Multicast Throughput as a Function of the Number of Des-
tinations for the Topology in Fig. 9. The ﬁgure shows the per-destination
multicast throughput of MORE, ExOR, and Srcr. The thick bars show the
average per-destination throughput taken over 40 runs with different nodes.
The lines show the standard deviation.
8.5 Multicast
We want to compare the performance of multicast trafﬁc under
MORE, ExOR, and Srcr. In §7, we described how multicast works
under MORE. In contrast, ExOR [7] and Srcr [6] do not have mul-
ticast extensions. Thus, we need to deﬁne how these protocols deal
with multicast. For Srcr we adopt the same approach as wired mul-
ticast. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd the shortest path from the source to
each destination, using ETX as the metric. These paths create a
tree rooted at the source. Srcr’s multicast trafﬁc is sent along the
branches of this tree. In contrast, with ExOR, we want multicast traf-
ﬁc to exploit opportunistic receptions. We ﬁnd the ExOR forwarders
for each destination. The per-destination forwarders use the ExOR
protocol to access the medium and coordinate their transmissions.
In contrast to unicast ExOR, if the forwarders toward destination X
opportunistically hear a packet by a forwarder in the forwarder list
of destination Y, they exploit that opportunistic reception. Said dif-
ferently, we allow opportunistic receptions across the forwarders of
various destinations.
Our results show that MORE’s multicast throughput is signiﬁ-
cantly higher than both ExOR and Srcr. In particular, we experiment
with the simple topology in Fig. 9, where the source multicasts a
ﬁle to a varying number of destinations. Fig. 10 shows the aver-
age multicast throughput as a function of the number of destina-
tions. The average is computed over 40 different instantiations of the
topology in Fig 9, using nodes in our testbed. As expected, the per-
destination average throughput decreases with increased number of
destinations. Interestingly, however, the ﬁgure shows that MORE’s
throughput gain increases with increased number of destinations.
MORE has 35-200% throughput gain over ExOR and 100-300%
gain over Srcr.
MORE’s multicast throughput gain is higher than its unicast gain.
This is because network coding ﬁts naturally with multicast. Recall
from the example in §2 that without network coding, a transmitter
(whether the source or a forwarder) needs to retransmit the union
of all packets lost by downstream nodes. In contrast, with coding
it is enough to transmit just the number of packets missed at the
downstream node that experienced the most packet loss.

Figure 12: Multi-ﬂows. The ﬁgure plots the per-ﬂow average throughput
in scenarios with multiple ﬂows. Bar show the average of 40 random runs.
Lines show the standard deviation.
Next, we run multicast over random topologies and multihop
paths. We pick a source and 3 destinations randomly from the nodes
in the testbed. We make the source multicast a ﬁle to the three des-
tinations, using MORE, ExOR, and Srcr. We repeat the experiment
for 40 different instantiations of the nodes, and plot the CDFs of the
throughput. Fig. 11 conﬁrms our prior results showing signiﬁcant
gain for MORE over both ExOR and Srcr. In this ﬁgure, however,
the difference between MORE and ExOR is less pronounced than
in Fig. 10. This is because the CDF uses random topologies with all
nodes in the testbed potentially acting as forwarders. This increases
the potential for opportunistic receptions and thus makes the relative
gain from network coding look less apparent.
8.6 Multiple Flows
One may also ask how MORE performs in the presence of multi-
ple ﬂows. Further, since the ExOR paper does not show any results
for concurrent ﬂows, this question is still open for ExOR as well.
We run 40 multi-ﬂow experiments with random choice of source-
destination pairs, and repeat each run for the three protocols.
Fig. 12 shows the average per-ﬂow throughput as a function of the
number of concurrent ﬂows, for the three protocols. Both MORE
and ExOR achieve higher throughput than Srcr. The throughput
gains of opportunistic routing, however, are lower than for a single
ﬂow. This highlights an inherent property of opportunistic routing; it
exploits opportunistic receptions to boost the throughput, but it does
not increase the capacity of the network. The 802.11 bit rate decides
the maximum number of transmissions that can be made in a time
