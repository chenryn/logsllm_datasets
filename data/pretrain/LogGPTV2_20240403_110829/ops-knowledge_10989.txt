User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: It finally worked!!!
I needed to do things to get it to work

Add C:\Python27\ to the end of the PATH system variable
Add C:\Python27\ to the end of the PYTHONPATH system variable

I had to add these to both for it to work.
If I added any subdirectories, it did not work for some reason.
Thank you all for your responses.
