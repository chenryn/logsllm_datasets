Assistant: Common open source databases include: 1. MySQL: One of the most popular relational databases, supports multiple languages and operating systems, and is stable and reliable. 2. PostgreSQL: more powerful than MySQL, supporting complex queries, transactions and stored procedures. It also supports multiple languages and operating systems. 3. MongoDB: NoSQL database, using document storage, supports distributed and high scalability. 4. Redis: An open source in-memory database that supports multiple data structures and storage methods, and is fast. 5. SQLite: A lightweight relational database that supports multiple programming languages and operating systems and is easy to use. 6. Apache Cassandra: Distributed NoSQL database with high availability and scalability. These open source databases have their own characteristics. MySQL and PostgreSQL are stable and reliable, MongoDB and Redis are high-speed and scalable, SQLite is suitable for small projects, and Apache Cassandra is suitable for scenarios with large data volume and high concurrency. Which database to choose depends on the specific needs and application scenarios.
