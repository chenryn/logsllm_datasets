## Mandatory Debugging Information

- **celery**: 5.0.1
- **django-celery-beat**: 2.1.0
- **Django**: 3.1.2
- **kombu**: 5.0.2

My Celery setup is managed by systemd, following the examples provided in the [Celery documentation](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/735f1679047a1358254252edc5cbf2624c86aadc/docs/userguide/daemonizing.rst#id94) for both `celery` and `celerybeat`, including the `Restart=always` directive.

### Problem Description

The daemon stops working after a few hours, with no discernible pattern. No Python errors or log messages are generated. The systemd journal shows the following entries:

```
-- Subject: Unit succeeded
-- Defined-By: systemd
-- Support: http://www.ubuntu.com/support
--
-- The unit celerybeat.service has successfully entered the 'dead' state.
Oct 24 01:50:27 nezzybuild systemd[1]: Stopped Celery Beat Service.

-- Subject: Unit succeeded

```

### Request for Assistance

What additional steps can I take to help further with debugging and identify the cause of Celery crashing into a dead state so suddenly?
