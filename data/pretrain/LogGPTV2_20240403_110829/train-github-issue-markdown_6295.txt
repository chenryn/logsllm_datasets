## Mandatory Debugging Information
    celery==5.0.1
    django-celery-beat==2.1.0
    Django==3.1.2
    kombu==5.0.2
My Celery setup is managed by systemd using the examples as in
https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/735f1679047a1358254252edc5cbf2624c86aadc/docs/userguide/daemonizing.rst#id94  
for both celery and celerybeat (including `Restart=always`).
The daemon stops working after a couple of hours (no pattern visible yet).
Without any python errors occurring or any messages about it in the log. In
the systemd journal I just see:
    -- Subject: Unit succeeded
    -- Defined-By: systemd
    -- Support: http://www.ubuntu.com/support
    -- 
    -- The unit celerybeat.service has successfully entered the 'dead' state.

    -- The unit celery.service has successfully entered the 'dead' state.
What can I do to help further with debugging to find the cause of Celery
crashing so suddenly into a dead state?
