## Expected Behavior
I am trying to build a `create-react-app` for production using `npm run
build``
## Current Behavior
    Creating an optimized production build...
    Failed to compile.
    Failed to minify the code from this file: 
            ./node_modules/material-ui/es/styles/withStyles.js:37 
    Read more here: http://bit.ly/2tRViJ9
This build process includes a minification step (can't be configured, for all
I know), which fails (see above), as the `1.0.0-beta.20` version of your
wonderful package is in ES6.
This error pattern is known in `create-react-app`, see the link in their docu:

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Can't provide a sandbox, as you need to use `create-react-app` and `build` for
prod.
  1. Create a `create-react-app`
  2. Add `material-ui` dependency (1.0.0-beta.20)
  3. Run `npm run build`
## Context
Trying to build for prod.
## Your Environment
node 8.1.1  
npm 5.5.1
