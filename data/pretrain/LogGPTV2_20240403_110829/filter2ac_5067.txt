### Title: Generating YARA Rules by Classifying Malicious Byte Sequences

While machine learning (ML) models have become the industry standard for heuristic malware detection, signature-based detection remains widely used due to its ease of updates, transparent detection logic, and operability in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce an interpretable ML model designed to generate signatures that optimize detection rates while minimizing false positives on a given dataset of malware and benign samples.

Our approach was tested on a corpus of malicious and benign ELF executables targeting i386 and amd64 architectures. We achieved detection rates in the 80% range with a false positive rate of 0% on the benign dataset, using only a few hundred YARA rules. This method is file-type agnostic and can be applied in various scenarios where YARA rules are utilized, such as static analysis of binaries, Cuckoo reports, network monitoring, and memory scanning.

We will also provide trained models, code for training and extracting signatures from your own datasets, and ready-to-use YARA signatures for detecting recent PE, ELF, and Mach-O malware.
