## Abstract
Android unlock patterns are still widely used, with approximately 25% of respondents in our study using a pattern to unlock their phones. Despite known security issues, the design of these patterns has remained largely unchanged. We propose Double Patterns (DPatts), a natural evolution of Android unlock patterns that retains the core design but requires users to select two patterns entered one after the other on the same 3x3 grid. We evaluated DPatts for both security and usability through an online study (n = 634) with three conditions: a control group, a first pattern entry blocklist, and a blocklist for both patterns. Our findings indicate that user-chosen DPatts are more secure than traditional patterns based on standard guessability metrics, comparable to 4-/6-digit PINs, and even more difficult to guess for a simulated attacker. Participants provided positive qualitative feedback, particularly those who currently or previously used Android unlock patterns. Overall, participants found the DPatts interface highly usable, with high recall retention and entry times comparable to traditional patterns. Specifically, current Android pattern users, the target population for DPatts, reported SUS scores in the 80th percentile and high perceptions of security and usability in both open- and closed-ended questions. Based on these results, we recommend adding DPatts as an enhancement to Android patterns, similar to allowing for longer PINs.

## Introduction
There are two primary knowledge-based authentication methods for unlocking mobile devices: 4-/6-digit PINs and Android unlock patterns. Prior research has shown that about 25% of users use patterns [4, 16, 19]. Despite the large number of possible patterns (389,112, more than 38 times the number of 4-digit PINs), users tend to select from a much smaller, predictable subset [4, 26], more so than with 4-/6-digit PINs [19, 29].

Unlike the transition from 4-digit to 6-digit PINs, there have been no significant changes to the interface of Android patterns since their introduction on the T-Mobile G1 (HTC Dream) in 2008. Various proposals to improve patterns include user-guided selection [12], rearrangement of contact points [25], strength meters [2, 23, 24], and expansion to a 4x4 grid [4]. However, these proposals either depart from the simple selection interface or introduce additional interventions that may frustrate users. Expansions like 4x4 patterns have not significantly increased security [4] against a throttled attacker.

To address these challenges, we introduce Double Patterns (DPatts), where a user selects two sequential, superimposed patterns on the same 3x3 grid (see Figure 1). This method increases the visual complexity and the total number of possible DPatts (151,407,759,432 options) compared to traditional patterns. DPatts leverage the popular 3x3 interface and encourage users to select more secure patterns through the increased complexity of multiple patterns.

We conducted an online survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk to assess the usability and security of DPatts, involving a preliminary survey (n = 286) and a main study (n = 634). Participants selected a DPatt and provided feedback on their experiences and perceptions. We considered three conditions: a control group and two blocklist-enforced groups. Using preliminary data, we developed blocklists for the first pattern and common DPatts.

Our results show that:
- DPatts do not degrade usability, with per-attempt entry speeds comparable to traditional patterns and high short-term recall rates.
- Participants reported good usability and high perceived security, encouraging adoption.
- Current pattern users, the target population, reported even higher positive sentiment for DPatts in both usability and perceived security.

These findings suggest that DPatts are a viable improvement to traditional Android unlock patterns, offering enhanced security and usability. Current Android pattern users would likely adopt DPatts as a natural extension.

## Contributions
- We propose Double Patterns (DPatts), a natural extension to Android unlock patterns where users must enter two superimposed patterns in sequence.
- We demonstrate that DPatts significantly improve the security of patterns using guessability metrics, outperforming both traditional patterns and 4-/6-digit PINs against simulated attackers.

## Double Patterns
Double Patterns are built upon Android unlock patterns, a knowledge-based authentication system where users connect points on a 3x3 grid. A traditional pattern must use at least four points, with no point used more than once and no unselected point avoided. There are 389,112 possible patterns [7].

DPatts require users to recall two previously selected patterns entered in sequence. Both patterns are superimposed, creating more complex visual shapes, and must be entered in the exact order for authentication. The same restrictions apply to individual patterns, but the second pattern can use all contact points, as long as it is different from the first. There are 151,407,759,432 total DPatts.

## Related Work
Prior research on Android patterns includes studies by Andriotis et al. [3] on user habits, Uellenbeck et al. [26] on guessability, and Aviv et al. [4] on self-reported patterns. These studies highlight the limited diversity and security of Android patterns. Attacks on patterns include smudge-based side channels [7, 11], shoulder surfing [5, 20], and video-based reconstruction [30].

Proposals to improve patterns include modifications to avoid shoulder surfing [14, 27] and smudge attacks [17, 22], rearranging contact points [25], and password meters [2, 23, 24]. Cho et al. [12] proposed SysPal, which highlights certain points, and von Zezschwitz et al. [28] suggested background images. Aviv et al. [4] found that 4x4 patterns offer little benefit.

DPatts offer a new direction, maintaining the popular interface while improving security without direct interventions. The use of multiple patterns increases the burden on observation attacks, making shoulder surfing and video-based attacks more challenging.

In evaluating DPatts, we also consider research on 4-/6-digit PINs. Bonneau et al. [10] studied 4-digit PINs in credit-card systems, Wang et al. [29] analyzed 4-/6-digit PINs from leaked data, and Markert et al. [19] collected PINs in the context of smartphone unlock. We compare DPatts to the security of 4-/6-digit PINs based on data from these studies.
