graph, it is clear that the distribution of non-PBN sites is roughly
distributed evenly over time, whereas PBN sites have a much higher
concentration of short-lived domains. There can be several pos-
sible explanations for this. First, the phenomenon of private blog
networks is relatively new, as they are a response to the recently
improved detection rates of other backlink abuse by popular search
engines. Alternatively, the high number of new domains could be
due to PBN sites being detected as backlink abuse by search engines,
requiring them to cycle through new domains.
5.1.4 Leveraging residual trust. When a new domain is purchased,
it generally takes some time before it is considered authoritative by
search engines, a prerequisite to boost the reputation of other sites.
However, to fast-track this, PBN providers may leverage residual
trust from existing domains that have expired [10, 13]. More specif-
ically, PBN providers can buy expired domains that had already
gained the trust and reputation with search engines. Furthermore, it
is likely that websites that previously linked to it do not remove the
links, and thus keep boosting the domain’s search engine ranking.
From the historical WHOIS data, we determined whether a do-
main was held by a different entity before it was registered to the
PBN provider. We found that of all PBN sites, 78.31% were owned
by a different party, whereas this is considerably less for non-PBN
sites: 48.26%. It should be noted that these values are upper bound
estimates, as a change to the registrant information in the WHOIS
would also be considered a change of ownership. Nevertheless,
these numbers indicate that PBN providers are taking advantage of
the residual trust of expired domains to improve their blog network.
5.1.5 Website infrastructure. As backlink providers manage tens
or hundreds of websites on which they regularly post new content,
they are likely to automate or simplify this process. One of the
ways they do this, is by leveraging content management systems:
we found that 70.48% of the PBN sites are powered by WordPress,
in contrast to 28.52% of the non-PBN websites.
5.2 PBN customers
In contrast to PBN sites, customers of backlink services do not
exhibit any site-specific characteristics that can be used to detect
them, as any type of website can purchase backlink services. How-
ever, it is still possible to leverage linking-based features that are
inherent to the backlink ecosystem: when buying backlink services,
the customer’s domain will receive multiple links from various PBN
sites. In our exploratory analysis, we found that the number of links
on PBN sites that were provided ranged from 5 to 27. Following
this information, we determine a website to be a customer of a PBN
service if there are at least 5 incoming links from sites that our

baseline, this confirms our intuition that buying backlinks is often
financially motivated. Counterintuitively, the Health category is
more prevalent with PBN customer sites. However, a manual anal-
ysis of a sample of these websites showed that the majority were
either health-related businesses, such as a plastic surgery clinic, or
were related to questionable practices such as online pharmacies.
Malicious Customers To get a better understanding of the mali-
cious activities of PBN customers, we make use of Virus Total which
aggregates many antivirus products and online scan engines. After
querying all the 12,848 PBN customers and searching for malicious
activities performed after the date we detected the customers, we
found that 717 (5.58%) of the customer websites have been used
for various malicious activities including phishing, distributing
malware or serving other malicious contents such as scams, adult
contents or offering illegal services. The majority of malicious cus-
tomers abuse PBN SEO techniques to promote malware distribution
websites (44.4%) and phishing website (19.6%).
We take a closer look at the date a customer purchases PBN back-
links to understand the dynamics of abusing this black-hat SEO
technique. For this purpose, we run a separate experiment in which
we monitor the detected PBNs for 35 days and record the back-
links created by these providers on a daily basis. In total, we find
that 25,271 domains purchased backlinks in this period of which
1,081 (4.3%) customers started to abuse the purchased links in or-
der to promote a variety of malicious contents. We observed that
these websites wait for an average of 138 days after the creation of
backlinks before they start serving malicious content.
6 UNCOVERING PBN NETWORKS
In the previous sections, we primarily focused on analyzing PBN
sites and their customers in isolation. As part of our exploratory
experiment, we found that PBN providers may have a substantial
number of websites, up to several hundreds, allowing them to pro-
vide links originating from various websites. However, as we found
in our large-scale analysis of PBN sites, administrators of private
blog networks employ various tactics to evade detection, as this
could render their entire network obsolete at once. Nevertheless, as
the backlink providers may forget about certain aspects, or out of
convenience or necessity create direct connections or similarities
between their PBN sites, it is still possible to associate them to a
single network. In this section, we discuss several techniques that
can be used for this purpose.
6.1 Webserver location
One of the most straightforward ways to link together a network
of PBN sites is through shared hosting. Of the 3,552 domains we
classified as PBNs, we found a total of 11 different groups where
at least ten PBN sites were hosted on a single IP address that was
not considered to be associated with shared hosting, following the
methodology proposed by Tajalizadehkhoob et al. [29, 30]. How-
ever, when analyzing these groups in more detail, we find that
several originate from the same subnet, and the domain names
share a common structure, e.g. for one group all domain names
are in the .biz TLD. When we consider the /24 subnet of the 11
different groups, we can join 3 groups, totaling to 8 distinct groups

classifier determined to be a PBN site.Out of the approximately 3
million unique domains that were linked to by the 52,777 analyzed
websites, we found 12,848 PBN customers. It should be noted that
this is a lower bound as our dataset only captures a subset of the
entire backlink ecosystem, and therefore not all PBN sites that link
to a single customer are present in the dataset.
We find that PBN customers receive on average 14.27 incoming
links from actual PBN sites. Considering that we only analyzed
a sample of all potential PBN domains, the average number of
PBN domains per customer is higher than what we experienced
in our exploratory experiment. A possible explanation for this
is that customers place multiple orders to counter the seemingly
temporary effect of purchased backlinks that we encountered for
the high-end backlink services as part of our effectiveness analysis.
Alternatively, website owners who purchase backlinks may try
their chances with different providers.
Although most PBN customers have a number of incoming links
from PBN sites that do not significantly deviate from the average,
we find that there are a few outliers. For instance, one website
is being linked to by 390 unique PBN domains. This website is
marketing1on1.com, the primary site of the backlink provider we
used to purchase a backlink package from (for Site #11, ref. Table 1).
Most likely, this provider is using their own PBN to boost the
visibility of their website. However, this also makes it possible to
easily trace all the PBN domains back to this single provider.
Finally, to gather more insight in which website owners are
mainly interested in purchasing backlinks for their domains and
what their motivation is, we look at the categories of PBN customers.
We use FortiGuard Labs’ mechanism2 to obtain the category for
each PBN customer domain. As a baseline of websites that are not
promoted by a PBN, we collect category information of a random
sample of 50,000 websites from the Alexa top 1M list. Figure 8 shows
the 10 categories that differ the most from the baseline. Interest-
ingly, the Business category is the most popular, with a prevalence
of 37.54% among PBN customers, and also differs the most from
the baseline. Along with the Advertising category that showed to

It is important to note that the sizes of these providers is a lower
bound, as a direct result of the sampling step of our guided search.
As backlink providers may be aware that hosting all their do-
mains on a single IP address makes it straightforward for search
engines to blacklist them, they may opt to leverage dedicated host-
ing. To evaluate to what extent this tactic is used and whether that
indeed makes them more resilient to detection, we map each IP to
its autonomous system and considered the ASes hosting the most
PBNs. Through this, we find a single organization, SEO Ways, that
hosts 103 PBN sites from our sample on 50 unique IP addresses
covering several subnets.
6.2 WHOIS information
Another technique that can be used to link together domains be-
longing to the same provider, is by analyzing WHOIS information
of each domain. In the previous section, we found that more than
half of the PBN sites make use of WHOIS privacy protection, show-
ing that many are well aware of this technique. Nevertheless, we
found 15 private contact email addresses that were used for the
registration of at least ten PBN sites. The groups of these networks
show interesting information about how different the operations
of PBN providers are. Whereas some providers try to diversify the
domain names in their network e.g. by using several TLDs, other
providers focus on a specific campaign. For instance, the largest
group of PBN sites targets a specific niche, namely law practices.
The domain names of all 23 PBN sites owned by this provider (the
largest group we found with this technique) were composed of a
specific law term such as “DUI”, “child custody” or “misdemeanor”
and the term lawyergo.
In order to get a more accurate estimation of the size of PBN
operations, we performed a reverse lookup to obtain all domains
registered by all the email addresses that were used to register PBN
sites. Through this technique, we find 2,629 new domains that are
highly likely to be involved in the PBN ecosystem. Furthermore,
we find that ten email addresses registered more than 100 domain
names; the top five registered 475, 466, 212, 179 and 160 domains.
This gives a clear indication that a single private blog network may
consist of several hundred websites.
6.3 Shared customers
Whereas the previous techniques leverage information from the
web infrastructure of PBNs, in this section we introduce a general
technique that exploits the intrinsic linking behavior of PBN sites
within their network. More concretely, when a customer purchases
a backlink package, the provider will create multiple links from
several websites out of her network. Consequently, PBN sites from
the same network are more likely to link to the same customers.
To leverage this behavior, we first create a graph where the nodes
represent PBN sites, and edges are created when two PBN sites link
to the same target website. We excluded links to websites that are
in the list of 1 million most popular sites according to Alexa, as
these are generally more likely to be linked to.
The weight of each edge is set to the total number of customers
the two PBN sites have in common. Next, to create clusters of PBN
sites, we remove edges that have a weight lower than a certain
threshold and determine the connected components of the graph.
Of course, the composition of these clusters is directly related to
the imposed threshold. To define this value, we leverage the PBN
networks we uncovered in the previous sections. More concretely,
we define a cost function that reflects how well the previously dis-
covered networks are represented by the connected components for
a specific threshold value. By iterating over all possible thresholds
in the range of 1 to 50, we find that the optimal value is 12, i.e. two
PBN sites are connected if they share at least 12 customers.
In total, we find 108 connected components representing 63.71%
of all detected PBNs. The remaining PBN sites did not share any
customers with other PBN sites, which could be either due to the
sampling process, or the limited number of web pages we visited
on each site. Of the 108 connected components, most are relatively
small; only 20 consist of more than ten PBN sites. Nevertheless,
this evaluation does reflect the magnitude of certain private blog
networks; we find that the five largest connected components con-
sist of 540, 460, 330, 152 and 80 websites. These numbers should
be considered rough estimations: on the one hand, we may have
missed sites from a network because of the sampling process, on
the other hand, if there are a sufficient number of customers who
purchased backlinks from multiple providers, the networks of the
providers would be joined. We find that the cluster of 330 PBN sites
is related to Marketing1on1, as all domains in this cluster link to it,
supposedly to promote the website of this PBN provider. In total,
we found 390 PBN sites that link to Marketing1on1, indicating that
the reported network sizes are likely to be an underestimation.
6.4 PBN Revenue Estimation
As a result of our analysis, we find two PBN networks that can
be linked back to a specific provider: i) our sample of analyzed
websites contains 103 PBN sites hosted on an autonomous system
owned by SEO Ways, ii) we find that 390 PBN sites link to a single
provider (Marketing1on1). For the other detected networks, we
were unable to link these back to a specific operation, and therefore
could not include these in our revenue estimation. In this section,
we leverage this information to create an estimation of the revenue
made by the PBN providers.
To compute the monthly revenue of the PBN providers, we crawl
their PBN sites (up to 200 visits per website) on a daily basis during
35 days and record all outgoing links that have been observed.
Next, we consider the first 5 days as the baseline period, and only
take the new links discovered during the following 30 days into
account. For SEO Ways, we find that during one month, there
were 796 new, unique customers being linked to by a total of 50
websites. Following the prices reported on their website3, they offer
packages of $150, $289 and $559, depending on the number of posts
that are created. As a lower-bound estimation, we consider that
customers only purchase the cheapest package and find that this
PBN provider grosses roughly $110,000 per month. The operating
costs of SEO Ways are mainly determined by the cost of their server
infrastructure: we found 50 IP addresses under their control that
hosted a website (using a reverse DNS database, we found 198
domain names pointing to one of their IP addresses). When we
consider the price of a dedicated server to be $100/server/month,
3http://www.seoways.com/pbn.html
and a domain name and IP address $5/month, we estimate their
operating costs to be roughly $6,000 per month.
Using the same method, we observed that in one month 3,520
links to new customers of Marketing1on1 were created, originat-
ing from 266 PBN sites. As listed on their website, Marketing1on1
provides four backlink packages ranging from $49 to $269. Again
considering only the cheapest package, we find a lower-bound rev-
enue estimate of $172,480 per month. In contrast to SEO Ways,
Marketing1on1 mainly leverages shared hosting providers for its
