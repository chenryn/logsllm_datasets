ABSTRACT
We demonstrate a new ad hoc routing method that can
handle transience such as node-mobility, obstructions and
node failures. It has controlled management overhead, and
is platform-independent (our demo includes phones, routers,
and laptops running di(cid:11)erent operating systems). It achieves
reliability and (cid:13)exibility at the expense of throughput. It is
ideal for scenarios where the reliability of connectivity is crit-
ical and bandwidth requirements are low. For e.g., disaster
relief operations and sensor networks. Along with applica-
tions, we exhibit measurements to illustrate the advantages
of our approach in dealing with transience.

INTRODUCTION
Multihop ad hoc wireless networks have not delivered on
their promise, especially for bandwidth-intensive applica-
tions. This is in part due to the inherent capacity limitations
of multihop TCP communication ([5]). Recent implementa-
tion e(cid:11)orts have achieved substantial throughput improve-
ments at the expense of (cid:13)exibility and reliability ([2, 4]).
However, the improvements are still not good enough to war-
rant real-life use, especially with mobile nodes. The goal of
this demo is to suggest that if the constraint of high through-
put is relaxed, it is possible to realize ad hoc networks that
are (cid:13)exible and reliable under transience. Moreover, such
networks have natural use cases for e.g.
communication
in disaster relief operations, wireless sensor networks such
as forest (cid:12)re detection networks, smart-home networks, etc.
By transience, we refer to the changing state of a network
along the following dimensions: (1) changing network topol-
ogy due to mobility, (2) changing physical obstructions, (3)
node failures and new nodes joining the network and (4)
interference.
In this demo, we propose to present a new routing met-
ric called ‘Reachability’ and a new routing protocol based

on it, called ‘Flexible Routing’. Reachability is suitable for
transient environments because it accurately captures tran-
sience, is easy to compute and maintain, enables a com-
pact representation of the entire network graph at individ-
ual nodes, and facilitates routing. Flexible Routing is a mul-
tipath routing protocol that uses pairwise-reachabilities to
reliably deliver packets under varying degrees of transience.
It trades throughput for availability and reliability.
2. REACHABILITY
Our routing method is based on the notion of reachability,
a directional metric, which captures the e(cid:11)ects of transience
in a single numerical value. Roughly speaking, it measures
the end-to-end, multipath probability that a packet trans-
mitted by a source node reaches the destination node.
It
is important to note that this probability should be over
all possible paths and not any single path (unlike previous
routing metrics, e.g., [3]).
De(cid:12)nition. Reachability(A,B,T,L) of node B from
node A is de(cid:12)ned as the expected number of packet
copies received by B for every packet originated at
A and di(cid:11)used in the network for at most L hops in
time interval T.
Reachability can be e(cid:14)ciently measured by exploiting the
broadcast nature of the wireless channel. To measure reach-
abilities of all other nodes, a node SRC transmits a packet to
the broadcast MAC address with a pre-de(cid:12)ned Time-to-Live
(TTL) value. Nodes receiving this packet di(cid:11)use it further
into the network until the TTL (cid:12)eld of all the packet copies
reaches zero. Thus, a node that is well-connected or highly
reachable from SRC receives more packet copies than a node
which is not. We map reachability to a (cid:12)nite value, roughly
its inverse, and call it E(cid:11)ective Distance.

3. FLEXIBLE ROUTING
Idea. Maintaining paths explicitly is not practical under
transience. Hence the core routing decision for (cid:13)exible rout-
ing is \Whether or not to forward?" instead of \Which node
to forward the packet to?". Each node maintains a compact
table (O(n) size) of pairwise e(cid:11)ective distance values com-
puted from receiving control packets, and uses these to se-
lectively forward data packets, e(cid:11)ectively pruning a (cid:13)ooding
tree. Although paths are not being created or maintained,
this opportunistic approach ensures that the packets end

up traveling along multiple available paths towards the des-
tination. This approach is network-aware and hence di(cid:11)er-
ent from controlled (cid:13)ooding, directed di(cid:11)usion, probabilistic
(cid:13)ooding or broadcast-storm techniques. In other words, the
routing algorithm ensures that packets on the network are
forwarded by only those nodes that are likely to increase the
chances of the packets reaching their destination.
Design and Implementation. We extend the mobile
ad hoc networking framework proposed in ([6]). Packets on
the network carry an additional header (Figure 1(b)). The
routing functionality can be broadly divided into two cat-
egories - ED Table Maintenance (EDM) and Routing. ED
Table (EDT ) is implemented in user space. Routing uses
data from EDT to make routing and forwarding decisions
(Figure 1(a)). Nodes make the forwarding decision by com-
paring the e(cid:11)ective distance in the received packet (EDcurr,
Figure 1(b)) with the e(cid:11)ective distance to their (cid:12)nal destina-
tion. A non-duplicate packet is forwarded only if the EDT
distance is within a threshold of the packet distance. Du-
plicate packets require a second stricter check. Broadcast
storms in dense network zones are avoided by probabilistic
forwarding rules based on the EDT . Layer 2.5 approach al-
lows interoperability with di(cid:11)erent MAC technologies. The
current implementation uses 802.11 a/b/g in ad hoc mode.
4. CONCLUSION
A preliminary evaluation of reachability and (cid:13)exible rout-
ing was conducted in a university building environment on a
network of eight nodes. Results (Figure 2) show that reacha-
bility captures (1) the phenomenon of increased connectivity
as network scales (Figure 2(a)), (2) the e(cid:11)ect of degraded
connectivity after node failures (Figure 2(c)) and (3) node
mobility. Moreover, (cid:13)exible routing utilizes reachability to
(i) strengthen routing as the network scales (Figure 2(b)),
(ii) gracefully degrade its performance as node failures hap-
pen (Figure 2(d)) and (iii) maintain performance for chang-
ing node positions.
Scaling (cid:13)exible routing to larger sized networks would re-
quire addressing challenges such as achieving desired consis-
tency in topology information (EDT ) and energy conserva-
tion. By focusing on availability under eventual consistency,

our approach aims to achieve a practical trade-o(cid:11) between
the mutually con(cid:13)icting goals of reliability, e(cid:14)ciency and
usability. Our technology, packaged as LifeNet [1], is cur-
rently being (cid:12)eld-evaluated for disaster communication ap-
plications.
