Abstract—Cyber criminals are increasingly using robocalling,
voice phishing and caller ID spooﬁng to craft attacks that are
being used to scam unsuspecting users who have traditionally
trusted the telephone. It
is necessary to better understand
telephony threats to effectively combat them. Although there
exist crowd sourced complaint datasets about telephony abuse,
such complaints are often ﬁled after a user receives multiple
calls over a period of time, and sometimes they lack important
information. We believe honeypot technologies can be used to
augment telephony abuse intelligence and improve its quality.
However, a telephony honeypot presents several new challenges
that do not arise in other traditional honeypot settings. We
present Phoneypot, a ﬁrst large scale telephony honeypot, that
allowed us to explore ways to address these challenges. By
presenting a concrete implementation of Phoneypot using a
cloud infrastructure and 39,696 phone numbers (phoneytokens),
we provide evidence of the beneﬁts of telephony honeypots.
Phoneypot received 1.3 million calls from 250K unique sources
over a period of seven weeks. We detected several debt collectors
and telemarketers calling patterns and an instance of a telephony
denial-of-service attack. This provides us with new insights into
telephony abuse and attack patterns.

Please press the number 1 on your phone . . . Or

In the United States, many have received such call, or
one like it. Perhaps similar calls come to unsuspecting people
in other countries. The frequency of such unwanted calls
(also called telephony spam) on our phones has increased
at an alarming rate. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
has received millions of complaints from citizens about such
unwanted and fraudulent calls. Recent increase in attacks over

the telephony channel can be attributed to the availability of
IP telephony (Voice over Internet Protocol). Such calls can
be made at no or low cost at scale in an automated fashion
similar to email spam, and criminals are already exploiting
the telephony channel to craft attacks such as voice phishing
(vishing). Unfortunately, attacks that utilize the telephone as a
resource are more successful because people in the past have
trusted the telephony channel. In fact, telephony has reportedly
become the weak link even for web security because cyber
criminals have used social engineering over the phone to reset
online banking credentials to steal money [48].
News articles have repeatedly highlighted recurring scams
relying on telephony such as the tech support scam [17], Nige-
rian scam [1], credit card scam [12] and the one-ring/missed-
call scam [26], [16], also known as Wangiri fraud [25]. In the
past, phone numbers have been proven to be quite effective in
nailing down illicit actors. Consumer protection agencies such
as the FTC have already taken down some scam operations
in this space [9], [8], [10], [7], and researchers have tried
to understand the phenomenon using empirical analysis [42],
[43], [44], [51]. Researchers have also used crowd sourced
datasets like 800notes [5] to understand how telephony scams
evolve e.g. Nigerian scam [41]. However, there exist many
limitations of the self-reported datasets like FTC’s fraudulent
complaint database and 800notes.
To gain a better understanding of telephony abuse, we man-
ually examined complaints both from the FTC and 800notes
crowd sourced complaint datasets and analyzed them on com-
pleteness, accuracy and timeliness. Since 800notes includes
detailed comments about an abuse instance, we use it
to
illustrate how the quality of telephony abuse intelligence needs
to be improved.
1)
2)
Completeness: It is desirable to have as much intel-
ligence as possible to have a complete picture of a
certain threat. It can be argued that when reports come
from a large set of users, the complaint set should be
reasonably complete. However, we have no way to
demonstrate this without a systematic exploration of
telephony scams.
Accuracy: A telephony abuse report should describe
who made the call, the time at which the call was
made, and information about the call that provides
evidence of it being abusive. Accuracy of such a
report means that the source and time are recorded
correctly and its description is objective and supports
why it is abusive. We found that due to the open
nature of 800notes forum, complaints on it are not
limited to telephony fraud; people use this platform
to complain about almost anything, like email spam,
SMS spam, voice spam etc. This results in noisy
data where all complaints do not pertain to telephony
abuse. It is possible that different people perceive
calls from a source differently and may disagree
with others about the reported number belonging to
a fraudulent caller. We found reports on 800notes
with completely opposite opinions about a spam call
source. In particular, we found conﬂicting opinions
about the call source actually being a major bank. It
could also be possible that the illicit actors themselves
are reporting positive reviews about calls from phone
numbers that are used by them. The noisy and con-
ﬂicting nature of user reports impacts the accuracy of
such datasets. Also, we found complaints without the
actual time of a fraud call and are also unclear about
the number of calls received.
Timeliness: Timeliness refers to how soon a report
is ﬁled after an abuse call is received. We found that
there is a delay between when the fraudulent calls are
made to people and when they are reported by them
to FTC or 800notes. Generally, abuse calls and the
phone numbers from where they come are reported
after several days or sometimes even weeks after the
time when the ﬁrst call was received. Also, people
report a source only when they have been called
multiple times, which also contributes to a delay.
3)
Although methods for collecting data in the crowd sourced
datasets can be improved [49], we believe accuracy, timeliness
and completeness are inherent challenges that will be faced by
such datasets. This is because users are often interrupted by
abuse calls when they may be busy with important activities
and expecting them to report all such calls accurately in a
timely manner would be impractical. Therefore, in this paper
we propose Phoneypot, a ﬁrst large-scale telephony honeypot,
to explore the feasibility of augmenting abuse information
available in existing crowd sourced and self-reported datasets
like 800notes and FTC complaint database. A telephony hon-
eypot should be capable of receiving, recording and monitoring
calls coming to it. Thus, by setting up a telephony honeypot,
we entice the attackers to make calls to phone numbers
associated with it. We deﬁne the term phoneytokens that are
phone numbers associated with a set of features e.g. age,
geography and history. Phoneytokens are a key requirement
and form the building blocks for a telephony honeypot.
Unlike traditional honeypots that are used to study online
threats, telephony honeypots present several new challenges.
Phone numbers and hence phoneytokens are a limited and
regulated resource that is not true for other resources like
email addresses. Also, phone numbers have attributes like
geography and age, which need to be considered. Telephony
honeypot implementation must also consider various ways in
which calls destined to phoneytokens could be received and
how callers can be engaged to obtain information about the
purpose of the call. Misdialed calls to phoneytokens cannot be
ruled out because a phoneytoken may be similar to a legitimate
phone number. These challenges must be addressed before a
telephony honeypot could become a valuable source of threat
intelligence.
In this paper, we argue the need for a telephony honeypot,
possible ways to build it, and demonstrate its use to augment
the intelligence available from other telephony abuse datasets
that currently exist. Our major contributions in this paper can
be summarized as follows.
1)
3)
There has been numerous reports about the scope and
magnitude of telephony spam and scams, however,
to the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to
systematically study them by using a large-scale
telephony honeypot. We show how such a honeypot
presents several new challenges compared to tradi-
tional honeypots and we explore ways in which these
challenges can be addressed.
2) We report results from the deployment of a ﬁrst
large-scale telephony honeypot. We worked with
an industry partner to build Phoneypot, which is
a concrete instance of such a telephony honeypot.
Phoneypot uses phone numbers obtained from a cloud
communication service provider with 39,696 phoney-
tokens. Once Phoneypot was deployed, over a period
of seven weeks, we received close to 1.3 million
unsolicited calls to phone numbers associated with
these phoneytokens. These calls came from a total of
252,621 unique sources, including sources that made
a large number of calls.
Our analysis of the calls that Phoneypot received
revealed several abuse or attack patterns. For exam-
ple, we detected several debt collector and telemar-
keters calling patterns and an instance of a telephony
denial-of-service attack. We also observed the sig-
niﬁcance of the number block issue date (i.e. age)
of a phoneytoken. Using t-test, we found that the
difference between the total number of calls received
on phone numbers that came from older blocks as
compared to phone numbers from newer blocks is
highly signiﬁcant.
4) We compared the timestamps of reports associated
with fraudulent phone numbers on the FTC fraud
complaint database,
to the time when Phoneypot
received a call from the same number. We found
strong evidence that Phoneypot can be used to com-
plement the current datasets and can help mitigate
the timeliness problem. Phoneypot also received calls
that were not reported on the other data sources and
hence could also improve completeness.
We believe a telephony honeypot can help us better under-
stand telephony abuse and attacks. It is the goal of this paper
to put this hypothesis on an empirical footing.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section we present work related to telephony abuse
(see Section II-A) and honeypots (see Section II-B).
A. Phishing, Vishing & SPIT
Phone spam in its very basic form has shown similarities
to email spam [20]. Low operating costs, high return on
investment, scalability, reachability and anonymity are some
of the shared attributes between the two channels that are
leveraged by scamsters [11]. Thus, it is worth reﬂecting on
2
existing solutions that are in place to counter email spam.
Pitsillidis et al. [55] discuss the rich and diverse set of spam
data feeds that has served as intelligence inputs in the email
space. They range from botnet datasets, MX honeypots, seeded
honey accounts, human identiﬁed spam email-messages and
domain blacklists. If we compare this to sources like the FTC
phone fraud complaint database [19] that is currently available,
there is a huge gap that needs to be ﬁlled.
For instance Jiang et al. [42], [43] rely on customer
generated reports [5] to identify instances of international
revenue sharing fraud [15] in call detail records corpora. Also,
calls and messages to/from premium rate numbers [42] and
services must be leveraged to create blacklists for potentially
vulnerable telephony endpoints. A telephony honeypot can
serve this purpose by logging activity associated with suspi-
cious phone numbers, their associated voice ﬁngerprints [35],
the transcribed message templates, calling/messaging patterns
(timing, frequency etc.) [33], [34], [68] and other metadata.
for a domain to point to an SMTP server that accepts all
inbound messages but has no legitimate email addresses [61].
They have also been setup by having seeded honey accounts
created across a range of e-mail providers whose sole purpose
is to capture unsolicited e-mail [55]. Jiang et al. [43] used
grey phone numbers (which are phone numbers associated
with devices that are not supposed to communicate with other
mobile numbers using SMS) to set up SMS spam traps at the
cellular network level.
III. TELEPHONY HONEYPOT CHALLENGES
As mentioned in section I,
telephony honeypots have
important differences compared to traditional honeypots that
are deployed to collect Internet threat information. As a result,
there are several new challenges that must be addressed before
setting up the telephony honeypot. We outline these challenges
and discuss how Phoneypot, our implementation of a telephony
honeypot deals with them in the next section.
B. Honeypots
A. Cost
Honeypots have tremendous potential for the security com-
munity – in principle it is an information system resource
whose value lies in an unauthorized or illicit use of that
resource [65]. Honeypots have been proposed and used ef-
fectively in various domains. In traditional networks they
have complemented intrusion detection systems [54], [62] and
ﬁrewall mechanisms well. They have been used to ﬁght email
spam [61], to characterize worms, botnets, malware and DDOS
attacks [66], [37], [55], [57], to deceive network ﬁngerprinting
tools [57], [58] and counter web server abuse [45]. They have
been proposed in the context of detecting database access
breaches [13], in detecting SMS spammers in cellular net-
works [43], for speciﬁc deployment in wireless networks [27],
and in general to protect large enterprises [47]. They have also
been proposed in the Voice over IP domain [67], [53], [38],
[24], [36] to combat voice spam or spam over internet tele-
phony (SPIT) [39], [68], [33], [34], [50], [60], [63], [64], and to
prevent vishing [49], [40], [23], [59], [46]. Telephony honeypot
seeks to serve a similar purpose in the telephony domain with
some key differences from works aforementioned. It monitors
spam calls irrespective of origination or path traversed, be it
PSTN, cellular or VoIP. This is useful if one takes into account
the architecture of current telecommunication networks where
we have a mix of cellular, VoIP and traditional PSTN networks
interacting with each other and calls being routed across them.
Although, conceptually the idea of a honeypot is similar
across domains, the decisions pertaining to their design and
deployment have varied. Provos et al. [58] elaborate on how a
passive v/s a highly interactive honeypot may affect its design.
Similarly, a decision on having a physical honeypot as opposed
to a virtual honeypot [57], [56] would most likely affect the
scale and ﬂexibility of its deployment. Telephony honeypot
deviates from the strict deﬁnitions above and takes a hybrid
approach. It can make use of a cloud infrastructure to set up
phoneytokens and other elements of the telephony stack. Thus,
the infrastructure can be virtualized while the phone numbers
remain real.
Techniques used to setup honeypots have also varied. Email
spam traps have been setup by conﬁguring the MX record
Some of the resources used in traditional honeypots can
be easily acquired (e.g., email addresses) at no or low cost. In
contrast, phone numbers are a limited and managed resource;
obtaining a sizable and diverse pool of phoneytokens and
routing calls to them may incur signiﬁcant costs. This is
