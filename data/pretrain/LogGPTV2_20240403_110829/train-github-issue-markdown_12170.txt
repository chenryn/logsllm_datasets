In the lovely FirstPersonCamera object, the onMouseDown event calls the
function `event.preventDefault()` which, of course, prevents clicking the
mouse from doing what it usually does. However, I want to have a text box
overlay in certain cases that can work in conjunction with the
FirstPersonCamera. Currently, the event listener for the mouse click overrides
all mouse clicks anywhere, meaning clicking on a textbox doesn't give it focus
(and presumably this affects a host of other issues). Can you make the event
listeners specific to the dom element of the renderer?
