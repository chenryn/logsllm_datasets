### Title: Implementing an Affordable Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) for Small to Medium-Sized Organizations

Over the past fifteen years, numerous large software development organizations have adopted Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) processes as effective strategies for delivering secure software. The motivation behind SDL stems from the recognition that software vulnerabilities can have significant consequences, including compromised information security, damage to organizational reputation, decreased customer satisfaction, and financial losses.

However, what if your organization is smaller, with fewer developers? Fortunately, implementing an SDL does not have to be a costly endeavor. While large organizations often have the resources to establish extensive teams and develop customized tools, smaller organizations can benefit from a more focused approach. They can tailor their SDL to address specific products, tools, and threats relevant to their software. Additionally, smaller organizations can leverage a wide array of free and affordable resources to help them create and sustain an effective SDL program.

With management's commitment to SDL fundamentals and an investment of resources proportional to the size of the development organization and its products, it is entirely possible for small organizations to build a robust SDL program and deliver secure software that meets customer expectations.

This briefing will highlight some of the resources available to smaller organizations for creating an effective SDL program. It will also discuss key secure development concerns, such as dependency on third-party software, and provide practical ways to address these challenges.
