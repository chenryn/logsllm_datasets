The following code snippet:
    import numpy as np
    print(np.array(-2, dtype=np.float32).astype(np.uint8))
returns different results on x86 and ARM:
    ARM:
    > 0
    x86:
    > 254
The issue seems to be similar to #16073 and #2398.  
My guess is that `char` might be used internally, which "has an
implementation-defined choice of “signed char” or “unsigned char” as its
underlying type" (source, ARM reference).
Using this assumption, I've rebuilt numpy using:
    CFLAGS="-fsigned-char" python setup.py develop -vvv
but the behavior didn't change.
After discussing this issue with @t-vi I'm unsure, if this is expected
(undefined) behavior or a bug, which could be fixed.
