```  
Is this correct? (y/N) y  
```  
6、输入KEY的标识  
```  
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.  
Real name: digoal  
Email address: PI:EMAIL  
Comment: test  
You selected this USER-ID:  
    "digoal (test) "  
```  
7、确认  
```  
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O  
```  
8、输入私有密钥的保护密码  
```  
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.  
假设这里输入了 hello123  
lqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqk

```  
生成好后，也能设置密码      
```  
# gpg --passwd "digoal (test) "

```  
9、生成密钥过程中，需要机器有一定的随机输入，所以我们前面启动了rngd  
```  
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform  
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the  
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number  
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.  
gpg: WARNING: some OpenPGP programs can't handle a DSA key with this digest size

10、生成的KEY如下  
```  
gpg: key 42CF57DB marked as ultimately trusted  
public and secret key created and signed.
