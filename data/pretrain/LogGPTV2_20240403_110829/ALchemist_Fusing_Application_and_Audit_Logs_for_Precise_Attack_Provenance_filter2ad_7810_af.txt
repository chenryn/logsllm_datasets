compare with the ground truth, we suppress non-determinism
by hosting resources on local servers and avoiding dynamic
contents (e.g., dynamic Ads in ﬁrefox).
For instance in the workload of ﬁrefox, we use HTTrack to
crawl 10 common websites, e.g., yahoo.com and CNN.com,
including all the content pages, CSS, and JS to a local folder
and then host these sites locally. We then use a command line
to open each site in a tab, e.g., “firefox -new-tab -url
CNN.com” to open CNN.com, and collect the corresponding
logs. All the log entries belong to the same unit. We do this
for the ten sites and acquire the ground truth.
Then, we use “firefox -new-tab -url CNN.com
-new-tab -url ...” to open the 10 sites simultaneously,
causing maximum interleaving. Then we use ALchemist to
partition application logs and attribute audit events. Recall in
Section I we discussed that OmegaLog [33] also partitions
execution by using repetitive control ﬂow paths (recovered
from application logs) to approximate units. We hence also
run the same experiment on OmegaLog for comparison.
The second row in Table VI presents the results for
ﬁrefox. The second and third columns denote the audit log
13
size and the corresponding application log size. The 4th, 5th,
6th, 7th, and 8th columns denote the number of raw event
entries, rule applications, derived relations,
inference time,
and memory overhead. The 9th and 10th columns denote
precision and recall for ALchemist, whereas the 11th and 12th
columns for OmegaLog. NoDoze does not partition execution.
Observe that ALchemist’s precision for ﬁrefox is 99.7%, with
only 16.9k events mis-attributed, while OmegaLog does not
support applications with asynchronous background behaviors.
Further inspection shows that ﬁrefox regularly updates backup
ﬁles like sessionstore.jsonlz4. Our system attributes
these updates to a tab instead of the ﬁrefox process. The
recall of ﬁrefox is 96.8%. The reason for missing entries is
the non-determinism of ﬁrefox execution beyond our control.
Speciﬁcally, different ﬁrefox executions use different
tem-
porary ﬁles to communicate with other applications (e.g.,
/tmp/dbus-XXX, with XXX a random string). Hence, the
ﬁle names in the re-execution are different from those in
the ground truth. The other applications have similar results.
Observe that ALchemist has 100% precision and recall for
many of them, denoting perfect partitioning. In contrast, for
the applications it supports, OmegaLog has good precision and
recall for many of them except two, where the log messages
do not have sufﬁcient information to recover precise paths.
The details of the workloads, the raw logs, and the derived
relations are posted on [2] for reproduction.
E. Effectiveness in Attack Forensics (RQ4)
To answer RQ4, we use ALchemist, the reimplemented
NoDoze [31] and OmegaLog [33] to generate provenance
graphs for the 14 APT attacks. During NoDoze attack foren-
sics, each event is assigned an anomaly score based on its
frequency (when compared to the normal proﬁle). Then the
anomaly score is propagated during causal path traversal. In
this way, an anomaly score can be computed for each path.
Paths having a high score (i.e., likely anomaly) are reported.
Then we compare the generated graphs with the precise ground
truth attack graphs (manually marked based on the attack
steps) to calculate the True Positive (TP), True Negative
(TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), Precision
and Recall values. In contrast, OmegaLog recovers repetitive
control ﬂow paths from application logs and use these paths
as the approximation of the execution units. An output event
in a unit is considered dependent on all the preceding inputs
in the unit. We tune our reimplementations (e.g., the threshold
for anomaly) until we can achieve similar performance as their
published results. The results are summarized in Table VII. The
table contains the following information: columns 2∼3 for the
ground truth number of attack related units and normal units
(note that attack steps may interleave with benign activities);
columns 4∼7 for the number of attack related and normal
units determined by ALchemist (a unit is considered attack
related if it is in the attack provenance graph), FP and FN
compared with the ground truth; columns 8∼9 for the ground
truth numbers of attack related events and normal events, each
including both the number of audit events (L) and the number
of application log events (H); columns 10∼13 the number of
FPs and FNs (of the events in attack provenance graph) by
ALchemist, the precision, and recall; columns 14∼17 the FPs
and FNs (only at the audit log level), precision and recall by
NoDoze, which does not use application log. The last four
