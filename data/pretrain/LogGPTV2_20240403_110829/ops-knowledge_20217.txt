User: How to protect a web application with sensitive data from hacking and data leakage? Please list some common security vulnerabilities and corresponding defense measures.
Assistant: 1. Common security vulnerabilities 1. SQL injection vulnerabilities: Attackers obtain or tamper with sensitive data in the database by constructing attack statements. 2. XXE attack vulnerability: Attackers attack the parsing and processing of XML documents by applications by inserting external entities into XML documents. 3. CSRF attack vulnerability: Attackers attack the application by disguising the source of the request, allowing users to perform malicious operations without knowing it. 4. XSS script injection vulnerability: Attackers can obtain sensitive information of users by inserting malicious scripts into web pages. 2. Defensive measures 1. Input filtering and data verification: filter the user's input to ensure that only data that meets the specifications can enter the system. 2. Parameterized query processing: Parameterized query is an effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks. It can make the parameters entered by the user become the parameters of the query statement instead of being directly used as a part of the SQL statement. 3. Set firewall rules: Firewall can set a series of rules to filter requests that do not meet the requirements, so as to prevent attacks. 4. Secure programming: Developers need to understand common security vulnerabilities and try to avoid using unsafe programming methods. 5. Network communication encryption: use protocols such as HTTPS protocol, SSL or TLS to ensure the encryption of network communication, so as to prevent data leakage. 6. Restrict user input: The length, type, format, etc. of the data input by the user can be restricted by means of software or hardware, so as to prevent the user from inputting data in malicious code or format. 7. Regularly update patches and bug fixes: Applications need to be regularly updated with patches and fixes to fix known security vulnerabilities in a timely manner, so as to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities to attack.
