This issue relates to
http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/templating/namespaced_paths.html
If you choose to render your templates using namespaced paths
    {% extends "@AcmeDemo/layout.html.twig" %}
It means that if you create a new bundle that AcmeDemo is the parent of, it
does not prepend the child bundle paths.
Eg, say I create AppDemoBundle which has a parent of AcmeDemoBundle it should
check for the templates in @AppDemoBundle/layout.html.twig before it checks
for @AcmeDemo/layout.html.twig
