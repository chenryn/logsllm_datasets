User: Please recommend a suitable server selection (CPU, memory, hard disk, etc.) based on the following server hardware configuration information. Current server hardware configuration:\nCPU: Intel Xeon E5-2620 v3 @ 2.4GHz\nMemory: 32GB\nHard disk: 2 x 300GB SAS 15K RPM\nEstimated load: 10000 visits per day, peak QPS is 300
Assistant: Based on the above hardware configuration and load requirements, the following server selection is recommended: CPU: Intel Xeon Gold 6254 @ 3.1GHz Memory: 64GB DDR4 ECC Hard Disk: 2 x 1.6TB SAS 10K RPM (RAID 1) The CPU of this server uses a higher The high-performance Intel Xeon Gold 6254 @ 3.1GHz has a higher main frequency and a larger cache to handle higher loads. At the same time, the memory of the server has been expanded to 64GB DDR4 ECC, which has higher stability and reliability and ensures the smooth operation of the system. In terms of hard disks, 2 x 1.6TB SAS 10K RPM hard disks can provide larger storage space, and use RAID 1 technology to improve data reliability and security. According to load requirements, this configuration can easily handle 10,000 visits per day and a peak value of 300QPS.
