User: I have installed Cygwin Terminal in OS Windows. But I need to install also python and make in cygwin.All of these programs are needed to run petsc library.
Does Someone know how to install these components in cygwin?
Assistant: After running into this problem myself, I was overlooking all of the relevant answers saying to check the setup.exe again. This was the solution to me, there are a few specific things to check.

Check /bin for "make.exe". If it's not there, you have not installed it correctly
Run the setup.exe. Don't be afraid, as new package installs append to your installation and do not over write
In the setup.exe, make sure you run the install from the Internet and NOT your local folder. This was where I was running into problems. Search "make" and make sure you select to Install it, do not leave this as "Default".
