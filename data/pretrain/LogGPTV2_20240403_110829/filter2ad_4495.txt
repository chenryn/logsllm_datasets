## Background & Problem
Security Operation Centers (SOCs) operate in two main phases:
1. **Attack Identification**: Conducted by Tier-1 SOC analysts.
2. **Attack Investigation**: Conducted by higher-tier analysts (Tier 2 and above).

The performance of SOCs is often difficult to evaluate because real-world attacks are not known in advance.

## SAIBERSOC Solution
### Architecture
SAIBERSOC uses a structured approach to inject synthetic attacks into a network environment to benchmark and evaluate the performance of SOCs. The solution leverages the MITRE ATT&CK framework for realistic attack scenarios.

## Experimental Setup
### Validation
- **Classroom Experiment**: 
  - Participants: 124 students, divided into 63 groups.
  - Task: Identify and investigate injected attacks.
  
- **GoodSOC Environment**:
  - Inject normal network traffic.
  
- **BadSOC Environment**:
  - Inject two types of attacks: Mirai and Exim.
  - Collect and analyze SOC reports.

## Experimental Validation
### Simulated Attacks: Raised Alerts
- **Mirai Alerts**
- **Exim Alerts**

### Attack Scenarios
- **Victim**: Target system.
- **Command and Control Server**: Used for reconnaissance and compromise.

## Results
### Attack Identification
**Figure 4: Attack identification by reported scenario.**

| Scenario           | BADSOC (n=32) | GOODSOC (n=31) |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Mirai reported     | 0.3125        | 0.387096774     |
| Exim reported      | 0.28125       | 0.548387097     |
| Both reported      | 0.03125       | 0.225806452     |
| None reported      | 0.4375        | 0.290322581     |

### Attack Investigation
**Mirai Attack:**
- **Reconnaissance**: 0.7 (BADSOC), 0.75 (GOODSOC)
- **Compromise**: 0.5 (BADSOC), 0.6 (GOODSOC)
- **CnC (≥1)**: 0.416666667 (BADSOC), 0.666666667 (GOODSOC)

**Exim Attack:**
- **Reconnaissance**: 0.111111111 (BADSOC), 0.235294118 (GOODSOC)
- **Compromise**: 0.888888889 (BADSOC), 0.823529412 (GOODSOC)
- **CnC (≥1)**: 0.222222222 (BADSOC), 0.176470588 (GOODSOC)

## SAIBERSOC User Interface
- **Attack Trace Library (AC-1)**: Depicted in (A).
- **Attack Generation (AC-2)**: Add attack traces to the timetable (B), with options to change playback speed and IP address rewriting (C).
- **Attack Injection (AC-3)**: Controlled using simple buttons. A red marker indicates progress on the timeline (B).
