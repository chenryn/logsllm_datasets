Background & Problem
Two phases:
• Attack identification:
Tier-1 SOC analysts
• Attack investigation:
Higher tiers (i.e., ≥ 2)
SOC performance:
We do not know attacks in advance

The SAIBERSOC user interface
The attack trace library (AC-1) is depicted in (A). Attacks are generated (AC-2) by adding attack traces to the timetable (B), optionally changing playback 
speed and IP address rewriting (C). The attack injection (AC-3) is controlled using simple buttons. A red marker indicates the progress on the timeline (B).
