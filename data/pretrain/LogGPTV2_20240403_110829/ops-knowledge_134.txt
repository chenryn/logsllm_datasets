User: Please implement an OpenStack-based private cloud platform to quickly deploy and run virtual machines and container applications. Please provide a detailed guide and examples of the installation and configuration process.
Assistant: The detailed guidelines and examples for implementing an OpenStack-based private cloud platform are as follows: Step 1: Install OpenStack First, OpenStack needs to be installed. This can be done on Ubuntu by using the command: ``` shell sudo apt-get install -y ubuntu-cloud-keyring sudo echo "deb http://ubuntu-cloud.archive.canonical.com/ubuntu trusty-updates/ kilo main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudarchive-kilo.list sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade sudo apt-get install -y python-openstackclient apache2 libapache2-mod- wsgi memcached python-memcache sudo apt-get install -y keystone python-keystoneclient sudo apt-get install -y glance python-glanceclient sudo apt-get install -y nova-api nova-cert nova-conductor nova-consoleauth nova-novncproxy nova -scheduler python-novaclient sudo apt-get install -y neutron-server neutron-plugin-ml2 python-neutronclient sudo apt-get install -y cinder-api cinder-scheduler python-cinderclient sudo apt-get install -y openstack-dashboard` `` Step 2: Configure OpenStack Next, OpenStack needs to be configured to use the private cloud. This can be done by editing the following files: ```shell /etc/keystone/keystone.conf /etc/glance/glance-api.conf /etc/nova/nova.conf /etc/neutron/neutron.conf /etc/ cinder/cinder.conf ``` needs to add the required configuration to better suit the specific environment. Some common options include: ```shell [database] ... [keystone_authtoken] ... [glance_store] ... [DEFAULT] ... [neutron] ... [cinder] ... [dashboard] .. . ``` Step 3: Create Tenants and Users Next, tenants and users need to be created to authenticate in OpenStack. This can be done with the following commands: ```shell openstack project create --description "Project 1" Project1 openstack user create --password Pa$$word User1 openstack role add --project Project1 --user User1 Member ``` Steps 4: Start the service Finally, the OpenStack service needs to be started for it to run in the private cloud. This can be done with the following commands: ```shell service glance-registry restart service glance-api restart service nova-api restart service nova-cert restart service nova-consoleauth restart service nova-scheduler restart service nova-conductor restart service nova- novncproxy restart service neutron-server restart service apache2 restart service memcached restart service keystone restart service cinder-api restart service cinder-scheduler restart ``` This will start the required services so that virtual machines and container applications can be deployed and run . Summary: Implementing an OpenStack-based private cloud platform requires installing OpenStack, configuring OpenStack to use the private cloud, creating tenants and users to authenticate in OpenStack, and starting services to run in the private cloud.
