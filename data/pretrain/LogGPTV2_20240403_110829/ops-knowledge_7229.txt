User: How do I direct Eclipse to the Python interpreter on my Mac?
I've looked in Library which contains the directory 'Python' then '2.3' and '2.5', however they contain nothing except 'Site-packages' - Which is weird considering I can go into the terminal and type python. I then installed the latest 2.6 version with package manager and still can't find it. Can anyone help?
Assistant: An alias to the python interpreter was likely installed into /usr/local/bin.  So, to invoke python2.6, type /usr/local/bin/python2.6 or, most likely, just python2.6.  If you want python to invoke python2.6, try rearranging your $PATH so that /usr/local/bin precedes /usr/bin.
