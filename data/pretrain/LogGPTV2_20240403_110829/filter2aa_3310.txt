---

#### Outline
1. **Anti-Mitigation (ROPChain)**
2. **Exploit Generation (CRAX)**
3. **Post-Exploitation (Metasploit)**

---

#### How Do You Feel?

---

#### If You Are a…
- **Programmer**
- **Hacker**

---

#### Return-to-Stack Attack

---

#### Protection Mechanisms - DEP (Data Execution Prevention)

---

#### Return-to-LIBC Attack

---

#### Protection Mechanisms - ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)

---

#### Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)
- **RET Instruction Sequences (Gadgets)**
- **Unrandomized Segment**

---

#### ROP Sample

---

#### More Complicated?

---

#### ROPChain
- **Generate Multiple Payloads**
- **Use Long Gadgets**
- **Integrate with AEG and Metasploit**
- **Defcon 2015 - fuckup**
  - **ELF 32-bit, static, NX**
  - **Re-randomize the text base**

---

#### Long Gadget Side Effects
- **Inter/Intra-gadget Dependency Problem**
- **Unconditional Jump**

---

#### Exploit Generation - CRAX
- **Transfer “Crash Input” to “Exploit Input”**
- **Single Path Concolic Execution**
  - **Symbolic Variables (x and y)**
  - **Path Constraint (e.g., x > 0, 2x + 1 < 10)**
  - **Symbolic EIP**
  - **Constraint Solver**

---

#### CRAX with ROPChain

---

#### Integration – Metasploit
- **Attacker Sets Metasploit Handler**

---

#### Demo

---

#### Summary
- **ROPChain**:
  - Provides a complete ROP Payload API
  - Generates payloads to bypass DEP and ASLR
- **Exploit Generation (CRAX)**:
  - Converts crash inputs into anti-mitigation exploits
- **Post-Exploitation Framework**:
  - Integrates with Metasploit
  - Simplifies post-exploitation tasks

#### Thank You for Listening.
