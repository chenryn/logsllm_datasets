According to the documentation, I attempted to use two different offsets for desktop and mobile devices. However, I was unable to locate the `col-lg-offset` class in the CSS file hosted on the CDN: 

```
http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0-rc1/css/bootstrap.min.css
```

I'm unsure if this is a problem with the CDN or if I am making a mistake somewhere. Could you please help me identify the issue?
