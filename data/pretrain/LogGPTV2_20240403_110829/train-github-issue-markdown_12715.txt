### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?
3.1.0
### Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?
Sharding-JDBC
### Expected behavior
support dynamic parameter on INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE.  
for example (mybatis mapper):
    INSERT INTO BlackMember (memberId, activeId, passiveId, project, platform, source)
          VALUE (#{memberId}, #{activeId}, #{passiveId},#{project}, #{platform}, #{source})
          ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE shieldStatus = #{shieldStatus}
### Actual behavior
    Cause: java.sql.SQLException: No value specified for parameter 7
### Reason analyze (If you can)
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule
configuration, when exception occur etc.
### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
### PS
Although I can find some explanation about why this feature should not be
supported #1066 , it's not convictive enough I think. As the official doc says
sharding-jdbc is 100% compatible for single-node routing SQL, it will not be
true if this issue exists, and I find it's really hard to migrate my projects
from Mycat to the Sharding-Sphere since it is common usage in my projects.  
So, could you please reconsider the possibility to support this feature.
