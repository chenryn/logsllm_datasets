I was tracking down an issue in my Emacs-based Julia REPL, which uses Emacs's
`ansi-term`. The issue was that `Base.Terminals.cmove_col` emits `\E[$(n)G`,
which `ansi-term` did not know how to deal with. Apparently this concrete
issue will be fixed with the next Emacs release, but strictly speaking `ansi-
term` was behaving correctly, because its `terminfo` entry did not report
supporting `CHA` (Cursor Horizontal Absolute), so the Julia REPL should not
have used it.
I don't know what the right approach would be to replace hardcoded sequences.
For a fully general solution, one could parse `terminfo`, and then emit escape
sequences accordingly, emulating missing ones, but that involves a lot of
tedious work duplicated in eg `ncurses`, OTOH that using the latter would be
overkill.
