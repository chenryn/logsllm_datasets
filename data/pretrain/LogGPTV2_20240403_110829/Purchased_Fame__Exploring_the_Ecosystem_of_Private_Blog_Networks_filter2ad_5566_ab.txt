In Figure 2, we show four of the aforementioned metrics of
websites’ reputation. When considering Citation Flow, we can see
that for the low-end and mid-end backlink services, there is no
apparent change in ranking after the links were created. For specific
services, e.g., the one purchased for Site #2, the backlink service
had an adverse effect, thus decreasing the ranking. For all of the
high-end backlink services, we observed an increase of the Citation
Flow metric around the time the backlinks were created. However,
for all except one, this effect was temporary and after two months,
the ranking dropped back to a value lower than the original.
The Domain Authority metric, reported by Moz, shows a simi-
lar trend as Citation Flow. For the low-end and mid-end backlink
services, the decrease in ranking over a longer time was more pro-
nounced. Interestingly, for the high-end backlinks, the two services
that improved Citation Flow the most (for Site #10 and Site #11), did
not have the same positive effect on the Domain Authority ranking.
This result highlights that search engines use different metrics to
compute ranking, so techniques that have little to no impact on
one search engine may prove successful with another.
An interesting outlier with regard to the number of backlinks is
Site #12: the backlink provider only reported 7 web pages on which
backlinks were created. However, the Majestic service found that
a month after the transaction was completed, 281 backlinks had
been created, which is most likely due to a mistake by the backlink
provider. As content is often automatically generated and placed
on the backlinking websites, we suspect that the backlink provider
mistakenly placed backlinks on all, or at least on a larger-than-
intended fraction, websites in their network.
Last, we evaluate the rank of a website in the search engine
results pages. In Figure 2, we show the evolution of the first occur-
rence of each website in the results of a single query. For brevity,
we only show the results of a single search query, as returned by
Google. This query was selected based on the number of correctly
obtained results for which the target website could be found within
the top 50 results. It should be noted that on multiple occasions, our
IP address was blocked from the Google Search Engine because of
the automated nature of our experiment. As a result, these metrics
could not be obtained daily.
In contrast to the Citation Flow and Domain Authority metrics,
there is no apparent improvement in the ranking of search results
for high-end backlink services. Moreover, Site #9 and Site #12 expe-
rienced a decrease in search ranking, i.e. the position at which they
are displayed increases after the backlinks had been created. Possi-
bly, this is because Google’s ranking algorithm is able to detect that
the back-references originate from websites involved in SEO-abuse,
thus leading to a penalty for the targeted websites. Note that even
though this behavior is the opposite of what was intended, it could
be abused to negatively affect the ranking of competitors.
For most websites, the Bing Search Results showed a similar
pattern as Google’s. However, for 4 websites, namely Site #2, #7,

#8, and #12, we found that the position of the website in the search
results improved from being outside of the top 50 to be the first
result after the backlinks had been created. Interestingly, backlink
services in all price ranges exhibited this behavior which indicates
that the mechanisms that detect artificial backlinks and penalize
websites purchasing them, are specific to each search engine.
Although our set of evaluated backlink services is not sufficiently
large to make conclusive claims on the effectiveness of purchased
backlinks in general, our results indicate that in several cases, back-
links are able to affect the reputation of a website. Furthermore,
there is an apparent difference in the ability of search engines and
companies that provide SEO-related reputation metrics to detect
new types of abuse. This shows that there is a need to improve
the detection of websites arranged in these types of private blog
networks. In Section 4, we propose such a detection mechanism
based on a multi-step machine learning classifier.
3 ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW
As a result of our exploratory analysis, we identified multiple parties
who each offer specialized services within the backlink ecosystem.
Furthermore, we identified that there are two main classes of abu-
sive backlinks provided: one class aims to leverage the reputation
of existing websites by insidiously creating links to customers, e.g.
by leaving comments or creating fake user profiles. The other class
leverages the reputation of domains that are owned by the backlink
providers themselves. In this section, we provide an overview of
the backlink ecosystem and focus on private blog networks.
3.1 Roles in the backlink ecosystem
Figure 4 shows an overview of the backlink ecosystem. To arrive
at this ecosystem, we read a large number of posts on SEO forums
and blogs as well as the documentation available on the websites
offering backlink services. Finally, all of our findings were inter-
preted in light of our backlink-purchasing experiments described
in Section 2. It is important to note that not all roles described in
the following paragraphs need to be simultaneously involved in
every operation, and that a single party may assume multiple roles.
Domain owners are the entities who want to promote their web-
site (Target site) by purchasing backlink services.
Backlink providers offer a service where, in exchange for money,
they create artificial links pointing to the website of their customers.
These links can originate from various sources: backlink providers
may try to leverage authoritative domains that are not under their
control, by creating fake profiles or inserting comments. One of
the goals of backlink providers is to build backlinks that resem-
ble organic linking behavior, in order to avoid detection. As such,
backlink providers may employ the specialized services offered
by “Social Media Managers” and “Content providers”, who respec-
tively generate links on social media sites and create content in
the form of blog posts related to the targeted website. Finally, back-
link providers may offer links originating from their own domains
(referred to as “Source domains”). These are websites under the
control of the backlink provider.
Content providers write original high-quality text that accompa-
nies the blog post linking to the PBN customer. This is done because
search engines may take into account several features about the
page that an outgoing link is placed on, such as quality of the con-
tent and relevance to the topic of the targeted website. Alternatively,
to save on costs, backlink providers may use content generation
algorithms, such as text spinners [25].
3.2 Private Blog Networks
To create links to their customers, backlink providers own a number
of domains that host websites containing a blog or another type
of content-management system (CMS). This allows the backlink
provider to automate the process of placing articles that contain
links to their customers. In most cases, backlink providers attempt
to grow their network with domains that already have a number
of incoming links from unrelated websites, and thus are reputable
from the viewpoint of search engines.
When a new website is added to the network, a backlink provider
may try to improve its ranking by having the other sites link to it.
While this practice may have advantages for the whole network of
websites — especially when it is large enough such that not every
website links to all other websites — it makes detection easier for
search engines. In 2013, Google uncovered a large network named
Anglo Rank [22]. Consequently, the websites involved in the net-
work were penalized, rendering all domains useless for the purpose
of SEO boosting. Additionally, the domains of the customers who
purchased this service were penalized as well which again demon-
strates that backlinks can be purchased to either boost one’s own
domain or damage the reputation of a competitor website.
4 DETECTION OF PBN SITES
In this section, we present a technique to detect websites belonging
to PBNs. A naive approach to this would be to randomly select
websites and classify these. However, because the vast majority
of websites on the web are unrelated to the PBN ecosystem, this
approach would result in a highly unfavorable base rate, causing
even a very good classifier to produce a high number of false pos-
itives. Therefore, in this work, we take advantage of an efficient
guided search approach which starts from an initial seed of known
PBN websites and leverages the linking behavior intrinsic to the

Next, using a two-step classifier, we identify
PBNs with an accuracy of 98.7%. By applying the classifier on a set
of 5.8M pages on 52.7K websites, we detect thousands of PBN sites.
4.1 Guided search to find PBNs
Our data collection methodology consists of multiple forward and
backward searches to incrementally build a backlinks graph where
nodes are websites, and edges represent links between them. In a
forward search step, we visit cross-domain links extracted from a
website while in a backward search step, we visit the backlinks of a
given node. The details of the algorithm are as follows:
(1) Backward search to build the initial seed of PBNs
As the first step, we start to compose a set of websites that have
been determined to be PBN sites: websites that created backlinks
to our domains as part of our exploratory analysis.
(2) Forward search to find potential PBN customers
For every PBN site in the initial set, we crawl up to 200 web pages
and record all cross-domain links. These contain links to other PBN
customers as well as to legitimate websites that are not involved
in the backlink scheme. Consequently, the linked-to websites are
labeled as potential PBN customers.
(3) Backward search to find potential PBN sites
Next, we obtain a list of backlinks pointing to any of the potential
PBN customer domains. This list includes links from PBN sites (in
case the customer did in fact purchase backlinks), and links from
other websites that link to the alleged PBN customer for legitimate
reasons. These websites can then be classified into PBN and non-
PBN sites. Note that these have a higher probability of being PBN
compared to a random sample of the web, as these are linking to
potential PBN customers.
The above interleaved forward and backward searches can be
repeated, where after the completion of the three steps, the detected
PBNs can serve as a new seed for the first step. In a first iteration,
we started with a seed of 50 PBN sites, and manually labeled the
output of step (3), i.e. 1,027 sites linking to potential customers. We
found 252 of these to be PBN sites, and use these as the seed for
a second iteration. By applying the three phases of the aforemen-
tioned method, we find 52,777 new websites that link to potential
customers. We use a multi-step classifier to label these, as described
in the following sections.
4.2 PBN classifier
We develop a two-class (PBN and non-PBN) multi-step classifier
built upon two sets of features, namely content-based and linking-
based, which are intrinsic to the two key characteristics of PBNs
operation. The insight behind content-based features is to capture
common structural similarities of PBN websites while the second set
of features represent linking behavior of the backlinks ecosystem.
Content-based features rely on the fact that PBN operators need
to rapidly and automatically create content and include links to
their customers while evading search engines. These types of de-
velopment practices result in having similar content structures.
The key insight used to design linking-based features is that PBN
operators, by definition, have to link to their customers. We take
advantage of such linking behavior of the network and formulate
them as classifier features. For example, the feature that captures
the number of links to PBN customers, should have a completely
different distribution in PBNs and non-PBNs.
4.3 Content-based classifier (step 1)
PBN operators develop their websites rapidly, mostly using popular
CMSs such as WordPress, use a template to automatically insert the
links of their customers, and try to balance between the content and
links to stay under the radar of search engines. From our analysis
in Section 2, we observed that because of the way they deploy their
websites, PBN websites share common structures. As such, content-
based features are designed to capture this common structure.
4.3.1 Content-based features. There exists an abundance of fea-
tures that can be collected from websites. In the iterative process
of feature engineering, we opted for features that are an intrinsic
part of the backlink ecosystem. Furthermore, we selected features
that either would be hard to circumvent, e.g. the customers that are
linked to, or come at a certain cost. For instance, while it is possible
for PBN providers to create many distinct-looking web pages, this
would require a significant cost and potentially make the backlink
service unprofitable.
c1: Number of words in anchor text for cross-domain links
When purchasing a PBN service, the customer is asked to enter
a number of keywords of their promoted website. Typically, cus-
tomers enter only one or two words, which are then used as the
anchor text. As a result, the median number of anchor words is
oftentimes lower than with regular sites.
c2: Alexa ranking of cross-domain links
The cross-domain links of PBN sites are mainly to their customers,
which are typically not widely popular. As such, the average Alexa
rank of cross-domain is relatively low. Moreover, we found that
several PBN sites also link to high-profile sources, i.e. for every
customer link, a link is created to a high-profile site. Most likely,
this is done to appear more authoritative. By incorporating the
first and third quantiles of the Alexa ranking, we also capture this
information. As PBN sites are required to link to their customers,
this feature is difficult to evade without incurring a significant
cost, either in the number of PBN sites or the effectiveness of the
PBN boosting.
c3: Number of cross-domain links
The main goal of PBN sites is to link to customers, so it is not
uncommon for them to have many outgoing links. Furthermore,
because a new page is created for every new customer that is
linked to, most pages have only a single cross-domain link. This
makes the distribution of cross-domain links per page significantly
different from most non-PBN sites. Although this feature can be
evaded by randomizing the number of links on every page, this
does require more effort by the PBN operator.
c4: Visually similar pages
As we showed in Section 5.1.5, many PBNs make use of a CMS
(70.48% of the PBN sites are powered by WordPress), allowing
them to easily create new pages. As a side-effect, many of the pages
on the website look visually similar. We make use of a perceptual
hash to determine the visual similarity of web pages. Although
this feature can also be circumvented by creating unique-looking
pages, this does require a significant effort by the PBN operator,
on the one hand on the design of unique-looking web pages and
on the other hand to orchestrate publishing new content.
