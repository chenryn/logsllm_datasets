The top 5 features with negative correlations are in
the ﬁrst column of Table 1. Many of these SMS in-
active users are enrolled in the pay-per-use SMS plan,
a common economical choice for users who rarely ac-
cess SMS services. Interestingly, a large number of SMS
inactive users have restrictions on their voice/text plans
and have been simultaneously enrolled in large cap data
plans. Such restrictions only apply for mobile users with
data only devices, such as tablets and laptop data cards,
etc. In contrast, the top 5 features with positive corre-
lations are summarized in the second column. Most of
SMS active users have unlimited SMS plans, a favorable
choice of frequent SMS communicators. Many of them
have also enrolled in small cap data plans and unlimited
MMS plans, which are dedicated for smartphone users.
Though service plans demonstrate clear distinctions
between SMS inactive and active users, relying on ser-
vice plans to identify SMS inactive users is not effec-
tive in practice due to two reasons. First, service plans
change frequently, especially when users upgrade their
devices. Second, query service plan information per-
sistently during run time can be very expensive. Fortu-
nately, our analysis above also reveals that service plans
are strongly correlated with the device types, e.g., data
only device users are less active compared to smartphone
users. Can we use device types as a proxy to identify
SMS inactive users instead? We shall explore such pos-
sibilities in the following section.
SMS towards data only devices. Like phones, laptops
and other data only devices are also equipped with SIM
cards and hence, once connected to the network, are able
to receive SMS messages. We thereforecan capture CDR
records to these devices at MSCs. However, manufactur-
ers often restrict text usage on these devices by masking
the APIs related to SMS functions. Meanwhile, at the
billing stage, text messages to these data only devices
(with a text restricted plan) are not charged by the carrier.
There are exceptions such as laptops enrolled in regular
text messaging plans, however, such cases are rare based
on our observations.
5.2 Identifying Grey Phone Space
The device associated with each phone number can be
found in the CDR data based on the ﬁrst eight-digit TAC
of the IMEI. We use the most updated TAC to device
mapping from the UMTS carrier in January 2013 and
have identiﬁed 27 mobile device types (deﬁned by the
carrier) which we summarize in Table 2. We note that
ﬁner grained analysis at individual device level is also
feasible. However, we ﬁnd that, except for the vehicle
tracking devices which we shall see soon, devices within
each category have strong similarity in their SMS active-
ness distributions. Hence we gain little by deﬁning grey

Fig. 7 shows the CDF distributions of SMS active-
ness of phone numbers associated with different device
types. We observe three clusters of CDF curves. The
ﬁrst one consists of curves concentrating at the top-left
corner, representing devices with very low SMS active-
ness. This cluster covers all data only devices and a ma-
jority of machine-to-machine devices (see [11] for more
discussions of M2M devices). The second cluster lies in
the middle of the plot, which includes all phone devices.
The third cluster contains only one M2M device type,
which covers all vehicle tracking devices. Interestingly,
the curve of such devices shows a bi-modal shape, where
some devices communicate frequently using SMS while
other devices mainly stay inactive. Based on Fig. 7, we
deﬁne grey numbers as the ones that are associated with
devices in the ﬁrst cluster, i.e., data only devices and
M2M devices excluding the vehicle tracking device cate-
gory. The collection of all grey number are referred to as
the grey phone space. The grey numbers are representa-
tives of a subset of SMS inactive users7. Meanwhile, the
grey phone space deﬁned in this way is stable because it
7We use devices in the ﬁrst cluster as our deﬁnitions of grey space,
however, as we have seen in Fig. 7, even within the grey number cate-
gories there are still (a very few) numbers that are highly active in SMS
communication. The proposed beta-binomial classiﬁcation model (dis-
cussed in detail in Section 6) will take into account this fact. Intuitively,
the model detects a spam number only when it is observed to have sig-
niﬁcant interaction with the grey space. Given a majority of the grey
numbers that are SMS inactive, the chance that a phone number is mis-
9
is tied to mobile devices instead of speciﬁc phone num-
bers, whose behaviors can change over time (e.g., when
a user upgrades the device). Furthermore, grey numbers
can be identiﬁed directly based on the IMEIs in the CDR
data with little cost, as opposed to querying and main-
taining service plan information for individual users.
5.3 Characterizing Grey Phone Space
We next study the distribution of grey numbers and show
how grey phone space can help us detect spamming ac-
tivities.
Fig. 8 shows the size of each area code in the phone
space (the x-axis, in terms of the number of active phone
numbers) and the proportion of grey phone numbers out
of all active phone numbers in that area code (the y-axis).
The correlation coefﬁcient of two dimensions is close to
0, indicating that grey numbers exist in both densely and
sparsely populated areas. The wide distribution of grey
numbers ensures a better chance of detecting spam num-
bers equipped with random spamming strategies. To il-
lustrate this point, we calculate the proportion of grey
numbers out of all the numbers accessed by spam num-
bers (red solid curve) and legitimate users (blue dotted
curve). We observe that a predominant portion of legit-
imate users never touch grey phone space. In fact, less
than 1% of the users have ever accessed grey numbers in
the 1 month observation period. In addition, we show the
same distribution for legitimate users (who have sent to
at least 50 recipients in a month) conditioned on having
touched at least one grey number. Compared to the spam
numbers which tend to access more grey numbers (red
solid curve), these legitimate users communicate with
much fewer grey numbers.
In most cases, the access
of grey numbers is triggered by users replying to spam
numbers who usually use M2M devices to launch spam.
classiﬁed as a spam number due to its interaction with these outliers in
the grey space is very small.

5.4 Discussion: Greyspace vs. Darkspace
In addition to the grey phone space, the “dark” phone
space (i.e., formed by unassigned phone numbers) can
also be a choice for detecting spam activities using
the same technique proposed in this paper. Analogous
concepts of grey IP addresses and dark IP addresses
for detecting anomalous activities have been explored
in [12,13]. However, unlike IP addresses which are often
assigned to organizationsin blocks (i.e., sharing the same
IP preﬁx), the phone number space is shared by differ-
ent cellular service providers, landline service providers
and even (IP) TV providers. Even if some phone num-
bers are assigned in blocks initially to a certain provider,
the frequent phone number assignment changes caused
by new user subscription, old user termination, recy-
cling of phone numbers and phone number porting in/out
between different providers will ultimately result in the
shared ownership of the phone number space as we have
seen today. For example, different cellular and landline
providers can have phone numbers under the same legit-
imate area code. It is difﬁcult to tell which phone num-
ber belongs to which provider without inquiring the right
provider.
This poses signiﬁcant challenges when we want to
identify dark (unassigned) phone numbers. As dark
phone numbers can be anywhere in the phone number
space (within legitimate area codes) and can belong to
any provider, it is rather difﬁcult to determine a dark
number, at least from the perspective of a single provider.
For instance, just because a phone number is not assigned
to any user/device belonging to a particular provider, it
does not necessarily mean that such a number is dark. In
other words, accurate detection of dark numbers requires
the collaboration of all the owners of the phone num-
ber space, which is an intractable task. Meanwhile, such
dark number repository needs to be updated frequently
to reﬂect the changes of phone number assignments.
In comparison, grey numbers can be deﬁned easily
with respect to a particular provider:
these are phone
numbers assigned to devices belonging to customers of
that provider where there are usually less SMS activities
originated from these numbers (devices). Meanwhile,
whether a number is grey is readily available to us (based
on the existing the IMEI numbers inside CDR records)
without any extra work.
6 System Design
In this section, we ﬁrst present an overview of Greystar.
We then introduce the detection model and how we
choose parameters for the model.

6.1 System Overview
The logic of Greystar is illustrated in Alg. 1, which runs
periodically at a predeﬁned frequency.
In our experi-
ment, we run Greystar hourly. Greystar employs a time
window of W (e.g., W equals 24 hours in our studies).
The footprint of each SMS originating number s, e.g.,
the sets of grey and non-grey numbers accessed by s (de-
noted as Gs and Ns, respectively), are identiﬁed from the
CDR data within W. After that, a ﬁltering process is
conducted which asserts two requirements on originat-
ing numbers to be classiﬁed, i.e., in the past 24 hours:
i) the sender is active enough (which has sent messages
to no less than M = 50 recipients. Recall the high send-
ing rates of known spam numbers in Fig. 3); and ii) the
sender has touched at least one grey number. These two
criteria, especially the second one, can help signiﬁcantly
reduce the candidates to be classiﬁed in the follow-up
step. In fact, we ﬁnd that, on average, less than 0.1%
of users send SMS to grey numbers in each day. More
importantly, these users cover a majority of active SMS
spammers in the network as we shall see in Section 7.
As a consequence, this ﬁltering step can noticeably re-
duce the system load as well as potential false alarms.

Once a sender passes the ﬁltering process, the function
detect spamnbr is called to classify the sender into either
a spam number or a legitimate number based on Gs and
Ns associated with that sender. In this paper, we propose
a novel Beta-Binomial model for building the classiﬁer,
which we explain in detail next.
6.2 Classiﬁer Design
We assume a random SMS spammer selects spamming
targets following a two-step process. First, the spammer
chooses a speciﬁc target phone number block. Second,
the spammer uniformly chooses target phone numbers
from that block. Let θ denote the density of grey num-
bers in the target block and X := {xi},1 ≤ i ≤ n be the
USENIX Association
sequence of target phone numbers selected. Meanwhile,
let k be the number of grey numbers in X. The target se-
lection process can then be formulated as the following
generative process.
1. Choose a target block with grey number density θ;
2. Choose xi ∼ Bernoulli(θ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n;
We note that θ varies as a spammer chooses differ-
ent phone number blocks. The choice of phone num-
ber blocks is arbitrary. For example, A spammer can
choose a large phone block across multiple area codes or
a small one consisting of only a fraction of phone num-
bers within one area code. Therefore, θ itself can be
considered as a random variable. We assume θ follows a
Beta distribution8, i.e., θ ∼ Beta(α,β), with a probabil-
ity density function as:
P(θ|α,β) =
Γ(α+β)
Γ(α)Γ(β)
