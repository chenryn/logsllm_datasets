A EXTRA EVALUATION AND QUALITATIVE
RESULTS
We here show supplementary results. In Figure 13, we present the
ROC curves of the binary classification task for each experiment
in the ablation study (discussed in subsection 6.2). In Figure 14, we
show a histogram of the phishing pages false matches per website
(subsection 7.2). In Figure 15, we show successful matching exam-
ples of the new crawled phishing pages (subsection 6.8). Moreover,
in Figure 16, we show correct matches across different websites
with similar colors that were still correctly distinguished from each
other (subsection 7.1). Finally, in Figure 17, we show successful
examples where the website logo’s colors and fonts were different
than the trusted-list to test versions changes (subsection 7.3).

We show here more details about the VisualPhish dataset. In Fig-
ure 18, we show a histogram of the most targeted websites by the
crawled phishing pages (section 4). Figure 19 shows the categories in
the benign test set that we constructed to reduce bias by having sim-
ilar categories to the trusted websites (section 4). Figure 20 shows
examples of the test set used to test browser differences (subsec-
tion 6.7). Figure 21 shows examples of the test set used to test false
positives when trusted logos are found in the page (subsection 7.1).
Examples of the variations (e.g. designs, colors and layout) of the
dataset’s phishing pages targeting one website are demonstrated
in Figure 22. Examples of the poorly designed (i.e. dissimilar to their
targets) phishing pages are in Figure 23. Also, Figure 24 shows ex-
amples of the screenshots used in the online user study to evaluate
dissimilar examples (discussed in subsection 7.2). Finally, Figure 25
shows examples of the newly crawled phishing pages to test the
performance against zero-day pages (subsection 6.8).
