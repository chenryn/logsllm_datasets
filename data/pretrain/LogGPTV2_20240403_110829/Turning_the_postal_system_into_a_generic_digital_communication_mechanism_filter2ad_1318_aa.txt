### Abstract
The "digital divide" refers to the disparity in internet access between rural and low-income residents, which is particularly pronounced in developing countries where the majority of the world's population resides. Addressing this divide, especially by enhancing broadband connectivity, is challenging due to constraints such as the time and cost involved in laying fiber and providing last-mile connections.

In this paper, we propose using the postal system to transport digital storage media (e.g., DVDs, flash drives, hard disks) as a general digital communication mechanism. While some companies have used the postal system for software and movie distribution, none have leveraged it as a generic digital communication medium supporting a wide range of applications. We term this system "Postmanet." Compared to traditional wide-area connectivity, Postmanet offers several advantages, including global reach, high bandwidth potential, and low cost.

Manually preparing storage devices for shipment can be complex, especially with multiple applications, users, and messages. Therefore, we explore integrating Postmanet with the Internet to combine their latency and bandwidth benefits, enabling sophisticated, bandwidth-intensive applications.

### Introduction
As the adoption of the Internet and broadband slows in the U.S., recent studies indicate that the "digital divide" is becoming more entrenched, with modest-income, rural, and minority populations lagging behind. In developing regions, where the majority of the world's population lives, the digital divide is even more pronounced.

Addressing this divide, especially through enhanced broadband connectivity, is challenging. Factors such as the time and cost of laying fiber and providing last-mile connections, along with the limitations of satellite-based solutions, make progress slow and expensive.

In this paper, we explore using the postal system to transport digital storage media as a general digital communication mechanism. While the idea of sending digital content via the postal system is not new—companies like AOL and Netflix have used it for software and movie distribution, and researchers have shipped hard disks with astronomy data—none have transformed the postal system into a generic communication channel. We call this system "Postmanet." Compared to traditional wide-area connectivity, Postmanet offers several key advantages:

- **Wide Reach**: The postal system is a truly global network, reaching a larger percentage of the world's population. It is a robust and proven technology that requires no significant new investment.
- **High Bandwidth Potential**: The amount of data that can be shipped via Postmanet over a few days often exceeds what can be transmitted over the Internet. This advantage is likely to grow as storage density continues to increase.
- **Low Cost**: The postal system is generally affordable, making it a cost-effective alternative to traditional ISP offerings, especially for large data transfers.
- **Good Scalability**: The postal system is highly decentralized and has experience handling surges in demand, such as during holidays.

Our goal is not to replace the Internet but to extend and complement it. For those without access to high-bandwidth connectivity, Postmanet can provide an inexpensive alternative. For those with both Internet and Postmanet access, we explore how to integrate both channels to leverage their respective strengths.

### Usage Scenarios and Applications

#### 2.1 A Transparent Postmanet Channel
We aim to make Postmanet as transparent as a conventional network channel for users. Imagine a box similar to a home network router, but with slots for inserting mobile storage media like DVDs. During the day, users interact with their applications as usual, and at the end of the day, the box ejects a DVD filled with data. A postman picks up the outgoing DVD and delivers an incoming one. The user simply inserts the incoming DVD, and the process continues seamlessly.

#### 2.2 Example Applications
- **Email with Large Attachments**: Users can send large files, such as home movies, via email. Small messages and acknowledgments can be sent over the Internet, while large attachments are transferred via Postmanet.

This integration of Postmanet and the Internet combines the low latency of the Internet with the high bandwidth of Postmanet, offering a robust and versatile communication solution.
