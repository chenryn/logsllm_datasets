ABSTRACT
The phenomenon that rural residents and people with low incomes
lag behind in Internet access is known as the “digital divide.” This
problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where most
of the world’s population lives. Bridging this digital divide, es-
pecially by attempting to increase the accessibility of broadband
connectivity, can be challenging. The improvement of wide-area
connectivity is constrained by factors such as how quickly we can
dig ditches to bury ﬁbers in the ground; and the cost of furnishing
“last-mile” wiring can be prohibitively high.
In this paper, we explore the use of digital storage media trans-
ported by the postal system as a general digital communication
mechanism. While some companies have used the postal system
to deliver software and movies, none of them has turned the postal
system into a truly generic digital communication medium support-
ing a wide variety of applications. We call such a generic system
a Postmanet. Compared to traditional wide-area connectivity op-
tions, the Postmanet has several important advantages, including
wide global reach, great bandwidth potential and low cost.
Manually preparing mobile storage devices for shipment may ap-
pear deceptively simple, but with many applications, communicat-
ing parties and messages, manual management becomes infeasi-
ble, and systems support at several levels becomes necessary. We
explore the simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and the Post-
manet, so we can combine their latency and bandwidth advantages
to enable sophisticated bandwidth-intensive applications.

INTRODUCTION
As the adoption rates of the Internet and broadband connections
slow down in the U.S., latest studies [16, 10] suggest that the “dig-
ital divide” could be solidifying: those with modest incomes, rural
residents, and minorities are among those who lag behind in Inter-
net access. Most people living in developing regions, who represent
an overwhelming majority of the world’s population, also largely
fall on the “wrong” side of the digital divide.
Bridging this digital divide, especially by attempting to increase
the accessibility of broadband connectivity, can be challenging.
The improvement of wide-area Internet bandwidth is constrained
by factors such as how quickly we can dig ditches to bury ﬁbers
in the ground. The cost of furnishing “last-mile” wiring can be
prohibitively high, and the progress has been excruciatingly slow.
Satellite-based solutions have severe cost and aggregate bandwidth
limitations.
In this paper, we explore the use of digital storage media (such
as DVDs, ﬂash memory devices, or hard disks) transported by the
postal system as a general digital communication mechanism. While
the idea of sending digital content via the postal system is not a
new idea—companies (such as AOL and Netﬂix) have used this
approach to deliver software and movies on a large scale, and some
researchers have reported shipping hard disks ﬁlled with astronomy
data [8]—none of these existing attempts have turned the postal
system into a generic communication channel that can cater to a
wide array of applications. We shall call such a system a Post-
manet. Compared to traditional wide-area connectivity options, the
Postmanet has several important advantages.
• Wide reach. The postal system is a truly global “network” that
reaches a far greater percentage of the world’s human population.1
It is a robust and proven technology that works well today; and to
use it for digital communication, one requires no signiﬁcant new
investment in exotic equipment.
• Great bandwidth potential. If we compare the number of bytes
that can be shipped by the Postmanet against that can be transmit-
ted over the traditional wide-area Internet in the time interval of
one or a few days, it is a well known phenomenon today that the
former can be far greater than the latter. Some may consider this

exist in every village in the country [17].
159phenomenon a temporary ﬂuke as a result of the relatively poor ca-
pacity of today’s Internet. We, however, believe that this is not the
case. Our belief stems from observing some fundamental technol-
ogy trends. Storage density of ﬂash memory and magnetic disks
has been increasing at the annual rate of 60% to 100% for many
years, and it is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. Besides
ﬂash memory and hard disks, even the next generation Blu-Ray
DVDs can hold up to 27 GB per disc. Moreover, one can always
ship multiple units at a time. The amount of information that can
ﬁt in a ﬁxed amount of volume, or that can be shipped by the postal
system for a ﬁxed cost increases at an exponential rate, one that
the realizable wide-area Internet bandwidth growth is unlikely to
be able to keep up with. Indeed, far from being a temporary ﬂuke,
the bandwidth gap between these two modes of transport is only
expected to widen as the storage density continues its rapid im-
provement.
• Low cost. The goal of providing citizens with affordable access
to postal service is typically an integral part of most nations’ postal
system charters. In the U.S., even if each household sends (and re-
ceives) one DVD each day, the monthly cost of about $10 compares
favorably with existing ISP offerings, especially if we were to con-
sider its vast bandwidth potential. The relatively liberal use of the
postal system by AOL and Netﬂix highlights the low cost advan-
tage of this approach. This cost advantage can be more apparent in
certain foreign countries where dialup lines are charged based on
time spent online and can be much more expensive. In addition to
catering to “low end” users, the cost advantage of the postal system
relative to that of a high-speed wide-area network also holds for
corporate “power users” shipping large amounts of data [8].
• Good scalability. The postal system is highly decentralized, and

has tried and tested experience dealing with “ﬂash crowds” such as
those seen during certain holidays.
We note that our goal is not to compete against or to replace tra-
ditional Internet access; instead, our goal is to extend and to com-
plement the Internet.
• Extending the Internet. For those who have no access to connec-
tivity or high-bandwidth connectivity, the Postmanet can provide
an inexpensive connectivity alternative to enable certain networked
applications, especially bandwidth-intensive ones. The target au-
dience may not only include rural residents, those who live in de-
veloping regions, and economically disadvantaged people, but also
other groups of users, such as those who travel to places lacking
connectivity for business or recreational purposes.
• Complementing the Internet. Although the Postmanet can yield
enormous bandwidth, it has long (but reasonably predictable) la-
tencies, such as a small number of days. We call such a channel a
High Latency High Bandwidth (HLHB) channel. Correspondingly,
we call a traditional Internet connection a Low Latency Low Band-
width (LLLB) channel. For places with access to both an HLHB
channel and an LLLB channel, an interesting problem is how to
exploit an integrated and simultaneous use of both channels to get
the best of both worlds. For example, small requests, acknowl-
edgements, “NAKs,” and control messages may be sent along the
LLLB Internet, while large messages are staged on mobile storage
devices for transmission by the HLHB Postmanet. Another exam-
ple of the complementary nature of the Postmanet is that it may
increase the availability of the communication subsystem:
if the
Internet is down for some reason, one still has another alternative.
Manually preparing mobile storage devices for shipment may ap-
pear deceptively simple, but with many applications, communicat-
ing parties and messages, manual management becomes infeasible,
and systems support at several levels becomes necessary. In Sec-

tion 2, we describe the user experience with the Postmanet, and
some of its example applications. In Section 3, we describe sys-
tems support at the communication end points, which attempts to
transparently emulate a traditional network on top of the postal sys-
tem. In Section 4, we examine options of “routing” data from the
sender to the receiver in the Postmanet system. In particular, when
there are a large number of communicating parties, minimizing the
number of mobile storage devices sent or received at each site per
postman visit can be an important consideration. This is an exam-
ple of an unconventional routing metric that is unique to the Post-
manet. We discuss how a large-scale peer-to-peer system (such as
a ﬁle sharing system) can be built on top of the Postmanet. We
shall see two recurring themes at these different levels of the sys-
tem. One is the simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and the
Postmanet so we can combine their latency and bandwidth advan-
tages. The other is the exploitation of the abundant capacity and
bandwidth of the Postmanet to improve its latency, cost, and relia-
bility. We describe related work in Section 5, and our conclusions
in Section 6.
2. USAGE SCENARIOS AND
APPLICATIONS
2.1 A Transparent Postmanet Channel
An important goal of ours is to make the Postmanet as transpar-
ent as a conventional network channel for a user. One way of better
understanding this transparency is to visualize a box that is simi-
lar to a small conventional home network router: it allows several
home computers to share a wide-area Internet connection. A Post-
manet router is just such a box with one or more slots for inserting
mobile storage media such as DVDs. (See Figure 1.) During the
day, a user of the Postmanet router simply uses his applications in
a way that is almost entirely oblivious of the presence of the Post-
manet. At the end of the day, the Postmanet router box automat-
ically ejects an outgoing DVD ﬁlled with some data. A postman
makes a routinely scheduled stop to pick up the DVD for delivery.
(We will discuss options of postal label generation later.) Each day,
the user also picks up an incoming DVD dropped off by a daily
postman visit. The user does not have to manually inspect or pro-
cess the content of the DVD in any way: he just inserts the DVD
into a slot in the Postmanet router box. From that point on, the user
continues to use his applications in an oblivious way.
The details of this imaginary Postmanet router box can vary. The
box may not necessarily be a dedicated physical device: the user’s
home computer may shoulder the task. We may use different types
of mobile storage media: these may include read-only or read-write
DVDs, hard disks of various form factors, or ﬂash memory cards.
The number of the mobile storage devices picked up and dropped
off by the postman per visit may vary. The Postmanet router box
may or may not be complemented by a conventional wide-area net-
work connection. The box may or may not be shared by multiple
users. While all these details may vary, a constant is the trans-
parency feature: the fact that the user’s direct manual interaction
with the box is limited to the insertion and removal of a couple of
mobile storage devices per postman visit.
2.2 Example Applications
The following example applications share at least two common
themes: (1) their bandwidth demands can far exceed those that can
be met by a traditional wide-area network; and (2) these applica-
tions can beneﬁt from the simultaneous exploitation of the HLHB
Postmanet and the LLLB Internet.
• Email with large attachments. For example, one may be able
to send large home movie ﬁles via email. This application may
take advantage of the LLLB Internet by sending the small message
