In some cases, I would like to be able to more tightly bind a controller's
exception handling to the controller itself. I am imagining an
`@ExceptionHandler` annotation which can be added to a controller's methods,
which would be invoked by the framework if the `@RequestMapping-annotated`
handler methods throw an exception. These annotated methods would be used in
preference to the context-wide ExceptionResolvers.
This would be particularly useful in controllers with multiple
`@RequestMapping` methods, all of which have related exception handling
requirements, but which are specific to the controller. Handling this sort of
complex exception handling logic in a context-wide ExceptionResolver is
decoupling things too much from the source of the exceptions.
Thoughts?
