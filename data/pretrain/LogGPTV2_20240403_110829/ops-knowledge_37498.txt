User: Does anyone know how I would go about detected what bit version Windows is under Python.  I need to know this as a way of using the right folder for Program Files.
Many thanks
Assistant: You should be using environment variables to access this. The program files directory is stored in the environment variable PROGRAMFILES on x86 Windows, the 32-bit program files is directory is stored in the PROGRAMFILES(X86) environment variable, these can be accessed by using os.environ('PROGRAMFILES').
Use sys.getwindowsversion() or the existence of PROGRAMFILES(X86) (if 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)' in os.environ) to determine what version of Windows you are using.
