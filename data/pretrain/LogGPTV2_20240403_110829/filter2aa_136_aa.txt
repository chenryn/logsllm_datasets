Vulnerability Research - Reverse Engineering 
●
A lot of cross-compiled code 
●
Some interesting custom string-manipulation stuff (more on this later)
●
A lot of uses of dangerous functions
●
Mostly basic applications, nothing that complicated going on
Somerset Recon
Vulnerability Research - Reverse Engineering 
Analysis of binary protections:
●
DEP/NX enabled
●
ASLR enabled
●
PIE is not enabled
●
No stack canaries in *nix binaries, stack canaries present in Windows
●
SafeSEH used in Windows binaries
●
No Symbols

Vulnerability Research - Fuzzing 
Set up fuzzers to test various input vectors
○
Files
○
Network interfaces
○
Command line args
Used peach to do generational fuzzing 
○
A lot of structured, text-based formats
○
A lot of interesting code paths that needed magic numbers to 
reach
Somerset Recon
Vulnerability Research - Fuzzing 
●
Tens of thousands of crashes 
○
Core files everywhere
●
Lots of exploitable crashes
●
...but also tons of duplicate crashes 
●
We had issues keeping J-Link 
devices attached to VMs
Somerset Recon
Vulnerability Research - Fuzzing 
Issues keeping J-Link attached to VM:
●
After a crash the J-Link devices enter a bad state and are disconnected 
from the fuzzing VM
●
We created a crash monitor to trigger on any crash while fuzzing
○
Have the monitor run a script to check if J-Link had fallen off the 
VM 
○
If so, use libvirt to reattach the J-Link if needed

Local Exploits
Somerset Recon
CVE-2018-9094 - Format String Vulnerability
● J-Flash tool
● Found interesting custom printf style functions 
implemented in J-Link
Somerset Recon
CVE-2018-9094 - Custom String Formatting
Accepts limited subset of format specifiers
● Accepts basic specifiers: %d, %x, %p, %u, …
● Doesn’t accept the %n family of specifiers
● Accepts precision arguments: .number

CVE-2018-9094 - Format String Vulnerability
JFlashSPI_CL.exe -open 
xAAAA%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%
X%X%X%X%X%X%X%s
Somerset Recon
CVE-2018-9094 - Impact
● Lack of %n format specifiers reduces severity of 
this vulnerability
● Potentially could be leveraged as part of an 
exploit chain as a primitive to read arbitrary 
memory
Somerset Recon
CVE-2018-9095 - Discovery
●
J-Link Commander tool
●
Found via fuzzing and made up most of our exploitable crashes (>99%)
●
Traditional stack buffer overflow
●
Reads each line of a file into 512 byte stack buffer

CVE-2018-9095 - Exploitation
Steps to exploitation:
1.
Control over return address
2.
Get the address of Libc
3.
Use that to get the address of system()
4.
Call system() with arguments
5.
Bob’s your uncle.
Somerset Recon
CVE-2018-9095 - Triage
1. Control over return address
●
Used GDB Peda to calculate offset
●
Other cool tools (radare2, pwntools,  patter_create.rb)  out there can 
utilize cyclic patterns (De Bruijn sequence) to calculate offsets
