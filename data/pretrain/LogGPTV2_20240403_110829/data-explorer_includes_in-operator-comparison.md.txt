The following table provides a comparison of the `in` operators:

| Operator | Description | Case-Sensitive | Example (yields `true`) |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| [`in`](../kusto/query/in-cs-operator.md) | Checks if the value is equal to one of the elements | Yes | `"abc" in ("123", "345", "abc")` |
| [`!in`](../kusto/query/not-in-cs-operator.md) | Checks if the value is not equal to any of the elements | Yes | `"bca" !in ("123", "345", "abc")` |
| [`in~`](../kusto/query/in-operator.md) | Checks if the value is equal to any of the elements, ignoring case | No | `"Abc" in~ ("123", "345", "abc")` |
| [`!in~`](../kusto/query/not-in-operator.md) | Checks if the value is not equal to any of the elements, ignoring case | No | `"bCa" !in~ ("123", "345", "ABC")` |

> [!NOTE]
> Nested arrays are flattened into a single list of values. For example, `x in (dynamic([1,[2,3]]))` becomes `x in (1,2,3)`.

For more information on other operators and to determine which operator is most suitable for your query, see [datatype string operators](../kusto/query/datatypes-string-operators.md).

**Important Note:**
Case-insensitive operators (`in~` and `!in~`) are currently supported only for ASCII text. For non-ASCII comparisons, use the [tolower()](../kusto/query/tolower-function.md) function.
