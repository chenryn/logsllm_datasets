Question: "Consider an encrypted Android device where `vold` detects an error during the decryption process and `vold.decrypt` property is not successfully set to `trigger_restart_framework`. What is the NEXT step that `vold` is expected to take according to the encryption process?"
 "A": "`vold` waits indefinitely for the property `vold.decrypt` to change, ensuring that no further actions are taken without proper decryption."
 "B": "`vold` sets the property `vold.post_fs_data_done` to 1, assuming the decryption process was completed successfully."
 "C": "`vold` sets the property `vold.encrypt_progress` to `error_reboot_failed` and expects the UI to display a reboot message to the user."
 "D": "`vold` sets the property `vold.decrypt` to `trigger_default_encryption` to bypass the decryption process and boot the device."
Answer: C
